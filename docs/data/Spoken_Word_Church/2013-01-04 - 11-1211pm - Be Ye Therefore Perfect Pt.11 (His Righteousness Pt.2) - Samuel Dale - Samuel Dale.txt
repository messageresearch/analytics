been made U you know next Sunday will be our Christmas time together be fellowshipping together there will not be an evening service but we'll be eating together and fellowshipping and having a good time for our Christmas time and all and remember that the ladies on one side supposed to get something and the ladies on the other side supposed to get something and all the men supposed to take care of everything else right Lord so that you know they say we don't make the announcement you'll remember that one so you'll try to figure out what you're supposed to do but just make sure you get everything together and allowing with appreciate it but then uh there will not be a service here on the December the 25th and that will be the Christmas day and we will we should all of you a very merry Christmas and not have a time because it would pull you away from your families and things and all like that but we do that then the watch Night Service on December the 31st starting at 8:00 and then brother Tom uh Ernest will be with us from wi Kansas to preach the Saturday night service and then uh we will have a Sunday service on the first day of January which will be at 1:00 now only one service on that day and it will be at 1:00 so remember these announcements we keep making them over and over and over where that you won't you know you won't say well we forgot them but that's it okay any other announcements I gener forget something we had a wonderful time last night at the Bible study that's right and I encourage any of you to come we had I guess walk pretty close to biggest group that we've had last night they was the basement was full and we we really had a good time you know sitting around fellowshipping together and talking about the word of the Lord and get into some pretty good things some pretty good questions comes out and we get into some good thoughts and all about it and and we kind of got on one brother asked what about the 30 minute silence in heaven so we we kind of got into that and covering a little bit and over the years of What the Lord Has revealed to us and things but we really had a good time so we encourage you to come and be with us on the first and when it's like this week time it fell on the second because of of having to me being gone you know but uh we try to do it on the first Saturday right at 6:00 amen amen so Matthew 5 Heavenly Father we love you we thank you for everything we realize that without you there is nothing worth anything at all cuz What would life be what would anything be without our Lord and our savior we thank you we Praise Your Great Name this is not a gathering just to gather together to kill time or to take up some space or something somewhere but it's gather together to learn about you we ask you to just come on the scene now and speak to our hearts and Lord forgive our sins because we want to be cleansed and made right in you and Worthy and the only way we can be worthy is to stand in you and this have your way now as we read the word come and speak to us about it and let your light shine bless those that are not here you know the reasons so we commit it all into your hands we love you in Jesus name amen amen Matthew 5:37 but let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you see that was the Old Testament that was all little thing that was that was there but he set in a new way now new thought but I say unto you that you resist not evil but who soever that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mild go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would Bor of thee turn not thou away ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you why that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans Asain and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the Publican so be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven which is as your father which is in heaven is perfect now we'll go to verse 20 of the same chapter cuz remember we were reading that this morning what be you therefore perfect the requirement all right now adding another requirement verse 20 for I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the of the word now we were trying to talk about his righteousness and I told brother Joe just make it part two and we'll uh probably push what I was going to speak on over until next Sunday way to be preaching Wednesday so you know we'll be you doing that and and all and but as I said then it's required that we be perfect right we read that over and over and over and over and we keep on reading it it's required that we be perfect that's right and if God required it right then how could we as human Mortals ever think about it right but if he required it then he had to make a way right and he made a way because he came himself amen that's making the way for you and I all right now we're reading that we have got to be just as righteous you know unless our righteousness exceeds goes beyond excels further than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees and you think about it as I said then the high priest so you would talk about him and Paul saying blindess according to the law you know and uh that Pharisee standing there to go into the temple if they was anything could be found against him a mark whatsoever he was killed all right because of that because he was standing for something but we've got to exceed that right you know we've got to go beyond that all right now how can we go beyond the fact that we were talking about the word righteous bringing it down from righteousness down to righteous and then bringing it on back to stating where it begins at which is the word right you know the word right is where you begin at uh then it's righteous meaning going on over and then righteousness meaning his impartation unto us you know as we were going through perfect and imperfection Perfection being the fact that it relates to the god coming within us to live out all right if you remember that now then the fact of being right well Paul was right right so then concerning the law he was righteous right he was not guilty cuz that's what he said cuz it wasn't then like it is now of just the thoughts and and things back then if you didn't do anything you wasn't guilty as I said the other day it may sound funny but it would it be easier to live under the law to try to do anything and be good about it than it is today right because under the law if you didn't do it he wasn't guilty now there was nothing there that said that if you thought about it right you know right it wasn't there in the Old Testament all right but when you come into the New Testament to just think about it right see it's magnified to where that just our thoughts now are recorded against us all right see then we must exceed the righteousness of a man that would be standing there perfectly Justified right remember Justified as though you never done it right so then to be in that state what would a person be but the one that I say that spent his time to and would stand and say what he was would turn around and say I found that to be death that's right now is Paul saying you know cuz evidently they must have thought that and I know people thinking about me that's why I'm quick to quote things lot and they think well you don't believe in living right now where would you get that idea at see right so they evidently thought Paul was saying that because he was so adamant about laying down the the position and talking that they said well Paul shall we sin Let there be more grace yeah we need Grace so let's just sin you know let's just send a whole lot more and we you know let it abound which means he bow it up I don't think he smiled when he said that no when he concluded it he said God forbid cuz if I offer my members to that y then I am connected to that is that paraphrasing what he was saying right then no matter how good we could think we are we could never come to the place to be righteous amen or just or perfect right right there had to be an atonement amen that made them perfect right right without the atonment of the Old Testament they was not perfect all right without the atonement in the New Testament we're not perfect all right no matter what we think or no matter what we could say that we're not guilty right we're Guilty by the fact of who we are right that's right we were born in sin the pro said I hate to think I had to go to heaven on the basis of being born 5 minutes ago right what could a five minute old baby do right no but it was a product of sin right right it was death to start with right all right so then there there's no way to try to accumulate anything well if I could just do so much you know and you know if I could do this if I could do that then it it would would bring me to the place no wouldn't work right no matter what we do it won't work it's got to be by faith all right so we brought in Abraham then of Genesis 15 this morning and bringing it in to show that he believed the Lord and it was counted or reckoned or imputed unto him for righteousness amen he believed the Lord amen Noah I said believe the Lord offered to sacrifice was called perfect right job believed the Lord offered a sa called Perfect all right now so the Perfection and remember we brought out the other night was the Perfection by the law of keeping it or was Perfection by Grace that's right of believing what God has done righten the atonement which one is it right so we have to conclude that it would have to be the atonement right because it couldn't work then we went through Romans this morning Romans 4 talking about Abraham Y and how that it could not have been some thing that Abraham was a great righteous man because even the Bible said did he believe God when he was in uncircumcision that's right he believe God when it was still just in the uncircumcision state all right now CU Abraham was a gentile it was not a Jew that was over in the book of Jude I mean the book of the Jew when Jude come along in in second king Judah all right now so then Paul sums it up in our reading this morning that there was nothing for you to Glory that's right Paul was saying then that I have not done these things I'm blameless but he said I found that to be death right right all right and I want to be found in him not having my own righteousness we get to it in a little while but the righteousness which is by faith all right we read this morning where brother R said well we need more than anything is a revelation amen right the Bible says we're just as righteous as God Is by being in Jesus Christ and by being that then we have to depend on him right amen not to think of anything we could do or not do right right that's commendable see when I say things like that you say like like Paul should we sin that Grace May abound that's what the Mind goes to but listen I believe in living right amen that's right y all right I believe in trying to be right whether I be a Christian or not I want my family to have an opportunity to be able to look at it and say well at least Daddy tried right to live right I told you about the time we was riding around the road ter said we've been over and look this man's land and he and heard about this long old Shaggy thing you know we was going back around the road and he said Daddy I'm glad you don't look like that what do you mean he said well I want to look like that see so that's I want the kids to have an opportunity and I want you as a church to have an opportunity to hear the truth amen cuz that's what I set you free amen all right see no matter what I am then that's what I'm desire is for you to hear the word right in the correct order right you know because that's that's the point I want to do because then we got to have everything is by faith right everything is by Revelation right all right now let's deal with that a minute to think about it and think about some more scriptures that we were on this morning that go ahead and turn to Romans 3 and to think about everything being coming to you by Faith by what you can believe cuz you know Revelation is first what mental Faith right mental ability to believe to accept and then when our mental ability becomes the prophet said a spiritual Revelation that's right right then we get begin to get something we can stand on all right so it's a revelation we need it revealed to us that we're just as righteous as God is right but brother R said to accept the fact fact that he died for us and surely we want to accept that then we must accept that he has made us just as righteous as he is cuz he said to accept one is to accept the other to reject one right is to reject the other if you reject that you're just as righteous as God Is by being having the new birth being in Jesus Christ then you rejected he died for you right and you understand that statements he said we need it revealed amen mhm do we need to pray for a revelation more than anything in the world that's right you don't need to pray who's going to be president or what's going to be that's right you know God take care of that he said I put in Kings I take out Kings he'll have all that won't be no problem that's right we just leave it alone right go right on down the road say Glory Hallelujah you know for the the Lord to handle everything all right let's go to Romans and let's pick up kind of where we left off this morning and I want to continue on just a little bit on this anyway because I want you to see that like we're talking about Abraham believed God and it was counted now I've got about four statements from people saying what I asked the question this morning that blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin you know if any others have a comment or thought bring it to me and let's see if we can determine who that man can be all right that you know God won't impute sin all right now so we just bring them maybe we'll get them on next Sunday Romans 3 let's begin reading about verse 19 I wish you'd read all up and down you know where you could understand looking over at verse 10 he says there's none righteous no not one right though we don't have any all right so let's go to verse 19 for we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law now is that sensible enough it's talking to people that are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the the world may become guilty before God all right so now the law made us guilty y it didn't save us there's no salvation in the law listen right there was salvation to people when the law was in existence that made the atonement that done the correct thing but there was no salvation in the law right it was a condemner a Record Keeper Paul said everything was going pretty good till the law came y could it become a Record Keeper of us so watch what it's getting there therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin Paul said I wouldn't have known that it was wrong to lust if the Bible hadn't said Thou shalt not cover it you know something like that see it made us condemned well wouldn't it be then if we could think of anything that would try to save us wouldn't that be a condemnation instead of right that's what I don't understand when we want to consider even a thought right it's wonderful to be good when I say a moment ago people misunderstand that it's wonderful to be good I wish everybody was good wouldn't it be something if everybody in the world was good and trying to be right I'd probably be trying to go to the Moon cuz I know something's wrong cuz it ain't going to work all right would it be nice would it be something you could trust everybody in the world Amen I mean you young kids don't even know what in the world I'm talking about man used to have a store right there where WS were the edge of his yard and the man had a store there and he farmed and he built houses and things he's gone all the time so you just went to the store you went in the store and got what you wanted and you wrote it down charg this to my bill sign Samuel Dale or you just laid the money down on the counter to pay for it Y and this went on on you want to try it now no but so it's getting worse listen but now what the law then would be what would bring a knowledge of sin now watch it but but now the righteousness of God without the law watch it much righteousness of God without the law right now you see it in the next verse part of what it is for righteousness of God without the law is manifested what being witnessed by the law and the prophets now the law and the prophets Tes if IED spoke of witnessed that there was coming a time that it would not be the righteousness of the law that you would be going by you see what Paul's saying right see read the scripture just read it for yourself but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested are made known and what is it it's witnessed by the law and the prophets right so everything that was done back there is a witness that it would be coming a day that the law and the things would not be in existence but it would be the law of Jesus Christ right from the inward man all right right now cuz that's what it said being witness manifested all right what is it now what is this to be that the law and the prophet spoke of even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe there is no difference for all have sin and come short of the glory of God what's now being justified freely being made perfect right righteous how by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be be what a perpetuation or one who stands in the between and taking care you know through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God now so then the Catholics wrong when they say you can pay for sins before you do it yeah but Paul said it was the sins of pist right you don't get forgiveness what you going to do tomorrow no sir don't ask God to forgive you you're going to go do something you ask God to forgive you what You' done what to declare I say at this time his righteousness right that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus now where is boasting then Paul said M it is excluded right there's nothing you and I can brag about right right nothing period it is excluded yep all right where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of Works nay right but by the law of Faith right therefore M we conclude now what does that mean I'm going to sum up everything that I'm saying right here and I'm going to bring it to a conclusion amen right and I'm going to tell you now Galatians 1:8 if you add anything to what I'm fixing to say or how say it you are cursed right that good enough right well now brother that's over there and this is over here all all the word right so what does he say therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds y of the law right now that's his conclusion that you're justified by faith faith is a revelation right okay let's get more what Paul said let's go to to Philippians Philippians 3 let's get these things of what Paul is saying and then we can make a conclusion Philippians 3 verse 8 he's coming down verse 6 is where he says that that concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteous which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for God for Christ Y doubtly and I can all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of many things and do count them but dumb that I may win Christ and what and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law right the righteousness which is of the law it means you're not guilty that's the righteousness of the law means you're not guilty you didn't do it right now but that which is that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith all right how are you going to be righteous by faith what's Faith a revelation Revelation is of God's word so when are we going to start believing What God Says true right that should be the point right right Titus you like me some of these are hard to find so get over next to Hebrews and fill them and then draw back to Titus Titus 3 read all up and down below this you know above them and all like that but just to try to get a point not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of the Regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he said on us abundantly through CHR Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made ours according to Hope of eternal life right being justified by his Grace Grace righteousness peace Perfection all goes together right Hebrews 11 just to bring in a lot of scripture today amen Hebrews 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not yet as seen moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house what's now he believed God and he done what God Said right now watch what happened by the which words by doing what he done by the which he condemned the world and became air of the righteousness which is by faith right he condemned the World by doing what he done because he believed God and done what God told him and he became air of righteousness by doing so James D to line it up a little bit but couldn't all little James 2 23 and the scripture was fulfilled with say Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called what the friend of God cuz he do what God told him he became God's friend amen but he believe God all right okay well going over to John let's see one minute second Peter let's go to Second Peter 1 and verse one Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through that's right how through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ like Precious Faith through the righteousness of God 1 John 2 and 29 if you know that he is righteous ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of God now what does it mean to doeth righteousness well I don't do it I thought we were concluding the fact that we were the righteousness comes by faith I thought we were bringing the point out that the righteousness that we're talking about was by faith all right and if it be by faith then everyone that doeth which would carry over to the word righteousness because it's something working within us by grace are we saved through faith amen amen right and it would come out to be then that if we're born of God then is God doing in US his own righteousness right all right right second Corinthians that's the one we had this morning we used I think five I better get out of First Corinthians wouldn't read too good well this will be the background for later so let's drop up here to verse 16 and this might answer your question of who is the man that God will impute sin right verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh ye though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more what after the FLH flesh we don't go by the flesh we don't go by hunted and fished with him I done this I done that and and I got to be there no no no like a man told me one time he was sincere and I wouldn't don't make me lie to nobody but he told me he said Brother D I love the prophet and his family and he said if I love him he said I'd be there well if that's what he's you know I ain't going to condemn him cuz that's his thoughts and he died with that thought right believing that he' love the prophet's family and he'd be there you know I think it's all onc Grace I didn't know it was that way but that's all right therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and had give hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation what to with to understand that God was in Christ reconciling the world and to himself not imputing their transgressions unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now why it if if I read that correctly I I didn't know that I was to be imputing your transgressions that's what I thought it was saying uh you know that's what everybody wants to condemn everybody else but don't realize that they're being condemned themselves all right now we are an ambassador for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ de be you reconciled to God for Heath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin now what why in other words that we might be made the righteousness of God in him he became sin right for you and I that we might be made his righteousness all right Galatians 2 I think maybe we read that but let's see but I wrote all these down this yesterday no this the one was that is one what is it let's go to Galatians 2 we'll read it see what it is I got 2 20 and 21 right I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ died in vain right if he gave us the new birth that mean he took our place as we just read and then we can think about being righteous by him coming and living in us all right so now he's saying for if righteousness come by the law Christ died in vain yep right you wouldn't have no inheritance but let's go what we got one more Romans 5 verse 17 for it by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness till reign in life by Jesus Christ what is the gift of righteousness what is the gift of righteousness ver is a gift right right if it's a gift it's not something you work for you work for something it's payment right it's a gift but it's the gift of righteousness which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost or eternal life right so he gave us his own life paid the price P give us his own life what that we could be righteous as he is amen are you following me see then if he gave us those things then let's see I'm trying to look at what let make sure the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by Jesus by one Jesus Christ right yep be able to rule and Reign because we're just as righteous as he is right amen yep not by our works right righten by what we can believe that's right right but then after we're born again I dare us to say Well it don't matter what I do right now you can never realize that that it wasn't something you done to get you saved all right you said well I realize that well then why would we want to think about something after then that we could just live and get by with it right I want to r with him don't you amen I want to reign with righteousness rightness the fact of being right you just think when we get there when these days folks these scriptures going to mean a lot of things to usen right so we're going to see what it's all been cuz see our righteousness we talking about this morning is what filthy rags right on the S of God anything that we would think to make us good or whatever is filthy rags that's right all right but now do you know what his name really is Jeremiah like me Isaiah Jeremiah Jeremiah 23 let's see what his name is if his name then it's got to be our name right amen I have you got it Jeremiah 23 look at verse 6 in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness Jehovah dis Canute Y which means our righteousness amen that's his name I thought that when we get over there in Revelations about 19 that he comes back riding on a white horse and he has a name written no more no man knows what is it it's his righteousness you know we have that same name written on us am our righteousness the Lord our righteous notice it it's all in capital form that's right emphasizing what it's talking about now if that's his name as I said that would be our name can we all have the same name we're one family but I thought we read over there in in um Matthew that we would be that generation or be his children that's right if we're his children then we have the same name that's why everybody's looking for some kind of a new name situation I have exhausted the name of Jesus yet that's right though I'll just keep preaching that and then if there is a new name then he'll reveal it but if I don't exhaust the name you know in other words if I don't understand the name and what all the name is about how would I be able to understand a new one amen because it would require some new thing well let's just keep on where we're going and God reveals something to you you tell me about it amen he revealed it to me I'll tell you about it right my brother R said one thing about it you can't conjure it right right he said it'd be a revelation so real do you can't make it up right it was oh it's Mel ches it's it's this it's that well they've even believed it was William Brown right in this message yeah right believe it was William Brown if he does reveal a new name that's all right but I want to stay with a name that refers to our righteousness amen our righteousness which is in Christ Jesus all right now let's go one more while we here we just spend the rest of the service on this go to Psalms a lot of you know where I'll be heading on that Psalms 85 and let's just see what happened 2,000 years ago it happened in a two-fold CL it happened when he was born on earth right and it really come to reality on the River Jordan right as to talk about his name our righteousness talk about how righteous we are how righteous we are is because of what we believe right we believe God it can be imputed unto us for righteousness right we believe what God Said by the prophet we're righteous right but if we claim to believe what the prophet said and act like the devil that wouldn't be too good of righteousness so then our lives after becoming a Christian there got a lot to do with it you have anything to do with being saved except except the fact of accepting Jesus Christ that's right all right but then after you're born again your life is more meaningful than ever before amen because why wouldn't we want to be the children of God that's right why wouldn't we want to live like our father so if you're thinking about doing something the prophet said if you're thinking about doing something and something saids don't do it he said just don't do it the best way you know just don't do it that's the best way cuz if you feel condemned you not do it right but now let's think about it God came down that you and I might receive eternal life that's right God himself not another person the prophet said so for us to be righteous he said he had to make a way right he had to come himself so he didn't send a son he came himself right right cuz he just one true and living God he came himself so then what took place here in the scriptures let's just start reading in verse one Lord thou H has been favorable unto thy land thou has brought back the Captivity of Jacob that's right now I'm going surprise you a second we read these four verses so listen to them Lord thou H has been favorable unto thy land that has brought back to captivity of Jacob that has forgiven the iniquity of thy people that has covered all their sin right that's has taken away all thy wrath and has turned thyself in the fearlessness of thine anger turn us oh god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease now the psalmist David is this same dilemma that job was in you'll notice all the things he's talking about As Natural Things read all that's natural things you done this for Judah you done this you forgiven you he's looking for a savior I wrote this in my Bible probably I don't know 20 years ago he's like job he's looking for a savior we're looking for a savior right amen right we're looking for someone that can make us righteous right perfect and we realize it could only be almighty God Amen not a second person not another God not a demon god demon god is a Lesser God and that's what they're saying today that Jesus was another substance so that's a Dem of God you look up the word de of God it really means a right a Lesser God but now think about it the psalmist is saying Lord you've done all these things but I still don't see anything verse five will thou be angry with us forever will th draw out thine anger to all generations he doesn't see it does he right Willl thou not revive us again that the people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant us thy salvation then God speaks to him and prophecy right now listen I will hear what the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly surely his salvation is not them that fear Him That Glory May dwell in our land job was looking for a savior job knew of the righteousness of God he knew of the judgments he knew of the end and all of the things but he couldn't find a savior watch you surely his salvation is not them that fear Him That glor Glory May dwell in our land mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other that's right truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven right yeah the Lord shall give that which is good in our land shall yield our Increase righteousness shall go before him and Shall Set us in the way of his steps right job said I need a redeemer right and then it was revealed to him I know my redeemer liveth and in the last days he'll stand upon the Earth I'll see for myself what do you think that the psalmist David just said right he was needing a savior then he was doing the thing of talking about it will you be angry and he saying Lord show us your mercy and he says I'll hear what God has to say what God say God said mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other right Cru shall sprang out of the earth m truth Jesus Christ and righteousness shall look down from heaven you see when the Lord Jesus Christ was born upon the Earth righteousness and peace kissed each other amen God and man was reconciled that's right then when he came to the River Jordan it came into a deeper meaning of the same thing right brother Joe go ahead and pull him up her brother Anderson we didn't figure we'd get much further than this so we get on to number two this is taken from Paradox 1964 206b I wasn't giv him the time to do and they was waiting on me but listen what your Prophet has to say about this scripture look what he says when Jesus was standing there he's talking about how the Virgin birth with a paradox the Virgin conceive bring forth a child of God make flesh God changed his strand from Spirit to become man man changed he changed his tent his Dwelling Place in Tabernacle when Jesus was standing there and upon the shores of Galilee John looked up and he saw the spirit of God like a dove descending in a voice saying this is my beloved Son whom I pleased to dwell in and whom I pleased to dwell in to pleased to dwell the same thing verb before the adverb is all Seas this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in God and man became one God and man becoming one uniting together for Redemption how God that covered all space and time could come down and bottle himself into a man so he could taste death for all the human race the Creator dying to save his creation amen heavens and earth kissed each other man and God became one how can a man there he might dwell in man that he might dwell in man and fellowship is nothing but God condescending trying to get to his man that's right so Heaven and Earth kissed each other righteousness and peace you notice truth Springs out where did Jesus Christ come from right he came up out of the Earth the body all right righteousness looks down all right what happens on the River Jordan This is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell what does he say in the future home Liv right this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed for this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest go ahead and pull up the next one questions and answers number two 1964 8:23 the evening service when man was made in the image of God then God came down in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and God together heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sunship when the Lost became flesh and dwelt Among Us that's what happened in the psalmist the psalmist saw the Redeemer right he saw heaven and earth kissing each other okay look at the next one the lamb and the the dove pre 1957 uh 3:25 when this Dove came from the heavens the meest bird of all the heavens came to the meekest animal on all the Earth Heaven and Earth kissed each other Heaven and Earth was United together man and God was reconciled in one body the Lord Jesus Christ certainly was it was the god of Heaven in the form of a dove the Son of God in the form of the Lamb right the righteousness and peace has kissed each other in Jesus Christ right both on the River Jordan and his new his birth yeah look at this life now God making his promise 1956 1209 hey he's talking about the River Jordan now watch it that was the greatest event this world has ever seen and will see now watch mhm okay until Christ and the church has United together again amen right right that's right that back there was the greatest that had ever been until yep amen so what's going to happen righteousness is coming down from heaven truth is springing up in the earth amen right inside of you right right amen so that was the greatest event back there until yeah the church has United together again until Christ and the church yeah that is when God and man became one Heaven and Earth embraced each other and kissed each other and settled a sin question forever is when the Dove and the lamb United together one of the greatest that's when the price when the greatest reconciliation that was ever made it's when God and Christ United as one and friend let me tell you something we are God's lamb he liken us un to sheep so what is it the greatest event that ever took place until this end time amen because that's what's going to happen again right truth is now springing up out of the earth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free this message is the Bible truth right and as we become one with it righteousness is coming down from heaven that's right that's what that's why I'm not looking for the coming of the Lord up there right I've been looking at the coming of the Lord for a long time right but I thought your Prophet said to coming of the Lord was revealing of the of his word amen I mean that's what I thought he said that's right the revealing of his word where's he revealing in you Heaven and Earth is kissing again you're on Earth yes right when that word is revealed into your heart truth has sprung up right amen but righteous will be made known yes right now I ask you a simple question outside of the end time word did we know anything about how to be righteous right without this message to reveal it to us right we pondered our thoughts that's right we guessed we we would take things you know like and have no more conscience of sin well well we interpret this and then we interpret that instead of seeing what God wanted us to see right he is righteousness you said well brother D I've always believed that he gave me salvation but if you'll be honest with yourself until you heard of the message of the hour and I'll even come down a little further until you heard more into the where we're at now you don't like that stick in your hat and puff it I don't care because where is it preached around the message oh we're not in them little simple things we're here at this great headstone oh we just see there all these Lords and souls and yeah there stood a man on earth a little simple honest little man to fulfill the Bible that heaven and Earth would kiss each other what about it you and I right right true truth will spring up out of the earth amen was not it a man that brought us this message that's right man is it not that we depend upon the fact that the man brought us a message that's right right and you know what it's like we're talking about this morning where Abraham believed God now they're making a lot of statements today that brother brandham was wrong here and wrong there and up did this wrong that wrong y well I'm going to make my statement if he was wrong he brought me to Christ that's not right so then I don't believe he's wrong it's all problem I just like to make people think he brought me to Christ I thank God for everybody that's ever tried to help me right when I was in the Baptist Church I thank them for trying to help me right I did sure I thank the preachers and the things for trying to help me I came in message I had to leave churches couple of you know what I done before I left I thank them for helping me I still quote a lot what they say cuz it was true I thank them for helping me because the truth is what I want amen if it's a dumb donkey I want the truth right I ain't listening to him why not why not you see if we are just as righteous as God is then he's going to keep us from following or falling into the wrong thing right he's always done that's right right he's always guided us to the truth so evidently mercy and Truth is raised up right but righteousness looks down from heaven comes down to reveal itself upon Earth in a bride that believes she's perfect right right believe she's righteous because he said it right if he said it let me say it you know you say no no no I don't know where it's talking about me or not well who else is it talking about right why can't I believe behold I seen you Elijah amen why can't I believe that's for me amen I canot believe what this prophet's message is the truth right right that rose up out of the earth and went across the world right and amazing for me to read in 64 and go back and hear a tape in 57 and hear what is saying right that's right righteousness and peace has kissed each other amen let's stand come on thank on these things we got to have a communion right I'm forget okay nobody has to keep me straight let's turn in our scriptures read our scriptures and think about it yes who of any of us would be even worthy to take the communion where it be anything in any of us it would be even the thoughts of that's right being worthy but he made us worthy so before we go into the communion let's have a few minutes and just think about ourselves and ask God to make us worthy just to make us worthy yes to take the communion cuz if we don't see we drank dation dur our ownselves that's right right am that's why the Bible say it as many weak and sickly among you when he sleep why that's right cuz they never considered whether they was worthy or not they always thought they was well you know if the question was asked here today how many of us in here are worthy to take the communion I wouldn't raise my hand as to think I was worthy you wouldn't no but if I believe what he said say about me right thank you Lord then he's made me worthy he's made me righteous he's made me true he's made me perfect so I got to believe what he says then I depend on that right that's right do anything any need to get them out of the way that's the best thing to do that's right get them out of the way okay 1 Corinthians 11 chapter verse 23 for have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup with the cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body but this CA many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now here's one I like but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be de with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him meet at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest I would set in order when I come so let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer praying one for the other praying the Lord would make us worthy right Just Have Your Way Lord with each and every one of us forgive us our of our sins because when we stand with our sins forgiven then we're Worthy is what you made us we didn't make ourselves we're just resting upon what you say we love you and we thank you just cleanse us all from all unrighteousness cuz Lord we know that within us as human Mortals is no good thing that's right but yet in you is all things have your way in Jesus name Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today we ask you to sanctify it and Lord we know that it represents thy body which was shed for each and every one of us it represents the word word that made that body so as we break the bread as we partake you come in each one of us and be what we have need of forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness guide us in Jesus name amen it was broken body it wouldn't just that's right it wouldn't that he just they just took him up there and crucified him they beat him broke him everything it could be thought of look like a piece of hamburger meat no Beauty the Bible says that we should desire him what about that you know what he done that for me and you he paid the price Christ that we could be just as righteous as he is if we can believe it Lord Jesus we thank you for this wine it's went through the processes of Aging Lord better each day then it represents thy blood that was shed for us your life that we could live so now sanctify the wine and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen hallu Hall I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood it was Emmanuel's blood was Emmanuel's blood it was Emmanuel's blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood for I know it was the blood know it the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was he died upon the cross and I know was for like of all the times that communion has been taken and all of them still meaning and speaking of a time yes and we get there the marriage supper is going to be the communion that's where we'll take the communion we'll really realize realization then that's right because that'll be what we'll understand that's right we'll understand then what it really means and then why would it be if it wasn't there something Supernatural in the line why would it not be some of the disciples that expressed the communion you never thought of that I'm talking about some like Matthew Mark Luke John the writers the Peter the ones but they wasn't chosen Paul was chosen to tell us about the communion because he had the greatest knowledge of the Old Testament forms of the Passover the lamb the things that's right like Wade was preaching there years ago about it you know how that that there was a time in there that there was a part about the break into the bread the things that was in there included in it but not emphasized so much maybe until we wouldn't think about it right but see Paul understood that Paul had a good understanding right never even seeing the Lord never walking with him probably heard of him in life maybe he might have been off at school at the time you know but one day he became a Christian yes Lord and God said I need somebody to explain this communion Paul just start to say sits down and he writes to the Corinthians and he explains it first off because the Corinthians were getting together and just they knew about the communion but they were just eating meals and just doing everything you know just having a whole hoook lock it wouldn't sincere right and Paul sat down and wrote him and the Lord just directed his thought right down the line of what it all is about but talk about the communion to see what it really means think on these things cuz it's not just something we do once a month that's right or we have a time to do or whatever it's not that that's right it's the real sincerity of the heart let's all protect again you can be seated for a moment while we get through and read the scriptures and the foot washing just think on these things John verse 13 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas is carar Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he come from God and went to God he rised from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin be to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where with he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but my but also my hands in my head that's right Jesus said unto him he that is washed neth not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verely verely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do that let's Stand Together our heavenly father we thank you for this day for your love and guide us unto us thank you for Thy word thank you for the truth that Lord surely can raise up out of the earth and righteousness can look down from heaven and there'll be a kissing of each other Lord when we become one with you we love you and we thank you now as we go to this last part of the foot washing we pray that you'd bless be with each one and Bless the people on the way home give a safe journey and let your light shine in Jesus name amen you're dismissed pray one for another
