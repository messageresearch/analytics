[7:03] Easter seal um this list of the whole
[7:07] message that you're 65 and you'll see
[7:09] what we're trying to talk about but
[7:11] remember especially these that we're
[7:13] trying to give you a little bit
[7:15] ants to be able to get a better
[7:17] understanding okay visions one and
[7:20] Romans a our Heavenly Father we thank
[7:23] you for your love in your grace thank
[7:24] you for all things you said you gave
[7:27] them to us freely and we believe you we
[7:30] just ask you to help with some guidance
[7:31] tonight because Lord we want to say what
[7:34] you want us to say and we want to do
[7:36] what you want us to do we thank you for
[7:38] all the things that you have given us
[7:41] what you have revealed unto us Lord we
[7:45] pray that you would just open our
[7:47] understanding them of the scriptures
[7:49] that we may see the hour that we're
[7:51] living and be able to walk therein
[7:53] forgive our sins because we want to be
[7:56] covered by the blood and just have your
[7:58] way and keep each one of us Lord we love
[8:01] you and we thank you in Jesus name these
[8:06] are one then we'll go Romans 8
[8:13] that should be the garden father of our
[8:16] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[8:18] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[8:20] places in Christ according as he hath
[8:23] chosen us in him now where we were
[8:26] chosen we were chosen in him I mean he
[8:31] said well now I chose him no no we were
[8:34] chosen in him when before the foundation
[8:37] of the world that we should be holy and
[8:40] without blame before him in love having
[8:42] predestinated us unto adoption unto the
[8:47] adoption of the children of children by
[8:49] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[8:52] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[8:54] of the glory of His grace wherein he
[8:57] hath made us accepted in the beloved
[9:00] let's go go to Romans 8 and 1 start with
[9:05] verse 5 we've read these sundays are and
[9:11] just mentioned a little bit I told you
[9:13] we'd come back to this but I want you
[9:15] two to get what you know get the point
[9:18] tonight or what we're talking about
[9:19] about the quickening spirit of Almighty
[9:22] God all right Fred verse 5 for they that
[9:25] are after the flesh do mind the things
[9:28] of the flesh but they that are after the
[9:30] spirit the things of the Spirit for to
[9:33] be carnally minded is death but to be
[9:35] spiritually minded is life and peace
[9:37] because the carnal mind is enmity
[9:39] against God for it is not subject to the
[9:43] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[9:46] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[9:48] God but that but ye are not in the flesh
[9:52] and once but you're not in the flesh but
[9:55] in the spirit if so be that the Spirit
[9:58] of God dwelling you I now if it dwells
[10:00] in you you're not after the flesh you're
[10:02] after the spirit all right now any man
[10:05] have not the Spirit of Christ he is none
[10:08] of his and if Christ be in you the body
[10:13] is dead because of sin but the spirit is
[10:16] life because of righteousness
[10:19] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[10:22] Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[10:24] that raised up Christ from the dead
[10:27] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[10:30] his spirit that dwelleth in you so you
[10:34] may be seated the way that is blessing
[10:36] to the reading of the word now we have
[10:41] been trying to give a place to to say
[10:46] what I wanted to about this part the
[10:48] night intro just pray that the Lord with
[10:51] helpless to be able to deliver what
[10:55] we're thinking on and i was listening
[10:57] hard the other day and especially sunday
[11:01] afternoon when waiver administering and
[11:03] Lord Stokely spoke to me about the
[11:06] scripture we've been reading diverter in
[11:09] Ephesians so you know maybe I need to
[11:12] keep preaching on while maybe he'll
[11:14] speak some more to me but we just keep
[11:16] going now we're trying to get a point
[11:18] across from what is our point we're not
[11:22] concerned about the change of the body
[11:26] sure we are because we want it to take
[11:29] place alright but I don't believe that
[11:31] it's an automatic process over just a
[11:34] day coming or a time or a bus pulled up
[11:37] you know and you go get in the bus and
[11:40] and all the way you go I've never
[11:42] believed it that way I believe it's got
[11:45] to be something coming from inside of
[11:49] you all right and in doing that so you
[11:53] coming from the inside then it's got to
[11:56] be that we recognize the word of the age
[11:59] that we're living and recognize what
[12:02] aids were living in recognizing an hour
[12:04] day in this message all right see that's
[12:06] what I've been trying to get to you
[12:08] didn't that's why I chose our Sunday
[12:10] morning to just read their Romans 8 in
[12:13] and show you that whole when you got
[12:16] over there speaking verse 23 to the
[12:19] eighth chapter you know to wit the
[12:21] redemption of the body to understand the
[12:23] read
[12:23] section of the body then he goes on to
[12:26] express to us you know the the thing
[12:32] that will take place that will cause us
[12:35] to come to that position and I've just
[12:38] made the announcement but I'm not gonna
[12:40] get on tonight I've just made an
[12:42] announcement and asking you and that way
[12:44] of a helpless when we read it is for you
[12:47] to look up translation on glorification
[12:50] glorified glory etc look those things up
[12:55] and when we get back to it will try to
[12:58] minister on that because see they asked
[13:03] the Prophet one time and this will show
[13:06] you kind of were that i will be going to
[13:07] but not neither to ask him and contact
[13:10] order and dr. they said what will that
[13:12] translation be you know the great
[13:15] translation he said just a journey now
[13:19] it was a simple matter to him and he
[13:23] expressed how that that would take place
[13:26] so you know that's why I've done like i
[13:29] did with with paula said nepal what is
[13:34] it that we must come to he says an
[13:37] understanding an understanding of the
[13:41] reduction of the body or i call how can
[13:45] i take place he said well first you know
[13:49] as we read here in verse 11 you know if
[13:53] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[13:55] from the dead be in you you'll also
[13:57] quicken you right now so he gave us the
[14:02] key to see him in brenham said only the
[14:07] predestinated will be quittin now he's
[14:12] talking about quickening power to those
[14:17] that are living not the quickening power
[14:19] to not the one
[14:21] great we'll have to receive all them go
[14:23] by the grape we'll have to receive a
[14:24] cooling up yes a brain for it but we're
[14:30] not dealing with that because we are
[14:32] alive people we shouldn't even consider
[14:35] the point of saying that well I guess
[14:38] all this have to go by the grain you
[14:40] know well you know what that's exactly
[14:42] where you go no that's exactly your
[14:45] confession and God makes a intercession
[14:49] upon our confession according to the
[14:51] scripture but if we confess that we're
[14:53] going to be changed then he can reveal
[14:57] that to us and bring it to pass you
[14:58] breathe in fine see them in doing that
[15:01] then Paul he says that those who he
[15:05] justified now that's not talking about
[15:08] just getting born again I tried to
[15:11] express that to you because he said
[15:12] there when you go over about Romans 1830
[15:15] those who justified he has already
[15:18] glorified all right now see we we've got
[15:23] to come to a place to understand that
[15:27] you know the revealing of the word is
[15:31] the most important thing to us now not
[15:34] just our understanding of it open right
[15:37] did you remember that message I tried my
[15:40] best to to preach on it as good as I
[15:43] could that the disciples need our kin in
[15:45] the better gathered you know before the
[15:49] the holy ghost came and Jesus met among
[15:51] them and open their understanding of the
[15:53] scriptures but that did not give them
[15:55] any bird because John um could you know
[15:59] could say behold the lamb of God that
[16:02] takes away the sin of the world that
[16:04] didn't give him the new earth because
[16:06] Mary would say be it unto me according
[16:08] to that word I still didn't give her the
[16:11] new bird that's it she had to still go
[16:14] to penthouse to receive that he were in
[16:18] doing that then let's don't deal with
[16:21] this too fast
[16:21] that well you know I never seen that I
[16:24] remember one time we're sitting in the
[16:26] church and they were just rejoicing
[16:27] because a certain brother said we see
[16:29] there that's found in mark melesa John
[16:31] John 666 you know that was given the
[16:36] scripture you know John 666 to see that
[16:39] 666 everybody just rejoicing one we know
[16:42] I with wonderful I was fine but that
[16:46] didn't give me any rejoicing because
[16:48] that it always been that it had always
[16:51] been 666 they've never changed but see
[16:55] that with this the point would got
[16:57] contacted them what made them you know
[17:00] and like I've told you many times in you
[17:02] know when they found those lights 24
[17:04] messages it you know of other randoms
[17:06] that hadn't been found what you know the
[17:08] people were just elated to find it and I
[17:11] was too because to hear the message but
[17:13] to them it was maybe we'll find
[17:15] something in there that'll change us
[17:17] it's like some kind of a deal that
[17:21] happens or you know the other is just
[17:23] well we're sitting back waiting we just
[17:26] waiting on the bus to pull up and then
[17:28] we'll pull up one day and will be gone
[17:29] yeah now I don't want to do that right
[17:32] I've always been one day wanted to to
[17:36] get out and go and especially to be
[17:38] early when I'm going and and all of that
[17:41] I wanted I want to get that first you
[17:43] know in winning brother Harris and I
[17:46] went to Jamaica years ago that it's my
[17:48] first airplane flight and I told him I
[17:50] said well first when I guess we'll go
[17:52] first class and Anya we're first class
[17:54] woods on an airplane it's that front I
[17:57] said whether the plane lands or fog I'll
[18:00] be the first one on the ground you know
[18:02] because that's not always you like to be
[18:03] up and going you know but now think
[18:07] about what we're trying to say all set
[18:09] those who he justified he's already
[18:12] glorified right now if we could just see
[18:16] that the if we if we could just see what
[18:22] he's trying to tell us we would stop
[18:25] trying to be a
[18:28] position of some way of attaining
[18:31] justification are some way of attaining
[18:35] to some secret coded way of finding a
[18:39] glorification that we can walk into or
[18:42] or whatever could take place we would
[18:45] stop that and we would start realizing
[18:48] that God's Word said what we are we
[18:52] don't have to get something else the
[18:55] Prophet didn't come to tell us anything
[18:57] else he come to tell us the works in who
[19:00] else alright see in doing that then we
[19:03] look at it and we see that what if I
[19:07] said Paul said in verse 11 how's this
[19:09] gonna take place if the spirit of gun
[19:12] being you doing it quick and Jesus up
[19:15] will quickly human come on simple matter
[19:19] simple point what is it new birth all
[19:23] right then what are we been trying to
[19:25] preach about the new birth that the day
[19:27] you receive the new earth what is easy
[19:30] to understand the soul to go through
[19:32] justification same case the baptism of
[19:34] the holy ghost in the plan of addiction
[19:36] it's easier to see the world from what
[19:38] the prophet has spoken to us that you
[19:40] know in the days of Noah was justified
[19:42] in the days of Jesus redman blood on it
[19:45] were sanctified and one day of good
[19:47] fiery baptism s'alright but now what
[19:49] about their bodies we live in you see
[19:52] the day that he gave you that new birth
[19:55] right there your body was redeemed you
[19:59] said but look at it we're getting older
[20:01] look what's taking place well fine look
[20:05] what Jesus took place and the Prophet
[20:07] said his body was redeemed our air
[20:09] jordan that's right and look what he
[20:11] went through me but then she don't get
[20:14] something like that that you're making
[20:15] it something that it cannot be make it
[20:20] be eat or what is do it and that's the
[20:23] point of tinnitus to yes to see that
[20:26] we've got to beat
[20:27] to this word amen yeah all right now
[20:30] quick them to the word of the hour we're
[20:35] not being quickened to the word of
[20:37] Luther's age Wesley's aids are the thick
[20:39] off the lady even though that's part of
[20:43] the story but it's not to just be
[20:47] quickened to those things it's not even
[20:49] to be quickened back to the book of Acts
[20:52] but is to be quickened to that age you
[20:55] were in and I'll get to in a minute
[20:57] we'll see the prophec signal son okay
[20:59] but see quicken all said it will quicken
[21:05] your mortal bodies now
[21:14] if I said and we look at it like the
[21:16] Bible says it then your bodies are
[21:21] already glorified that's what God says
[21:24] man we've got to get to the point to say
[21:29] what he says he said it's already over
[21:34] right when we get into trying to figure
[21:38] out the mechanical side of what anything
[21:41] is instead of just believing what is
[21:44] saying and then read the mechanical side
[21:47] right out of the Bible you know read the
[21:50] verses right out of the Bible and see it
[21:52] and see that's exactly what the Bible
[21:55] say Paul how are we going to be changing
[21:58] changing the moment wink overnight
[22:01] what's gonna take place Lord himself
[22:03] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[22:04] the message me we know all of that well
[22:11] why are we looking for something instead
[22:14] of looking at what we're talking about
[22:16] me and seeing what God says about us see
[22:22] and that word quicken needs to be making
[22:25] life after death now gave you some
[22:29] quotes i probably won't use them I'll
[22:31] just pull it off with what it's on there
[22:33] to do it but you've got them where you
[22:34] can read them later but think about what
[22:37] it says quicken is to be make alive
[22:42] after death all right now according to
[22:47] Ephesians 1 to skew the seasons to one
[22:52] through five but this is read em I want
[22:57] to get this scripture in right here look
[23:00] at the theses to
[23:02] let's just get this into our
[23:05] understanding and we'll see what's
[23:07] taking place and we'll see the Bible is
[23:10] telling us not what has been not what
[23:17] will be the what we are right now all
[23:21] right so look at the scripture and you
[23:24] had any quicken who or what dead in
[23:27] trespasses and sin all right so quick it
[23:30] means to be made alive after you did so
[23:33] where were we were dead in trespasses us
[23:35] in we're in time past ye walked
[23:36] according to the course of this world we
[23:40] as human mortals me what lost just like
[23:45] the world was lost me according to the
[23:48] Prince of the power of the air the
[23:50] spirit that now worketh in the children
[23:52] of disobedience you know that same one
[23:55] was working in you and I we were thought
[23:59] was dead me among whom also we all and I
[24:05] got a big circle around we all at our
[24:07] conversation which manner of life and
[24:09] way of doings is what it's me in time
[24:12] spice in the lust of our flesh
[24:14] fulfilling the desires of the flesh is
[24:16] waivers breaking out soon DC and of the
[24:19] mind I mean son dead nun and we're by
[24:22] nature the children of Wrath even as
[24:25] other oh no no I've always been oh yeah
[24:29] your love your stewardess lead to over
[24:34] brother Dale I've always be okay but God
[24:37] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[24:40] wherein he look were in he with he loved
[24:42] us even when we were dead in sins hath
[24:46] quickened us together with Christ by
[24:50] grace you're safe aren't nice quickness
[24:55] he's made us alive alright
[24:59] now he give us the new birth made us
[25:06] alive right now making us look at
[25:13] Colossians let's just get a few scripts
[25:18] look at Colossians 2 and you'll see it's
[25:24] the same as is Ephesians in the basis of
[25:27] what it's saying 2 and 13 and you being
[25:33] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[25:36] of your flesh had he quickened together
[25:39] with him having forgiven you all your
[25:42] trespasses I reel off just I don't won't
[25:46] give it to these I'll just tell you kind
[25:48] of worth the read but sometimes when you
[25:51] have an opportunity read songs
[25:53] especially 119 right all right you'll
[26:00] find that the psalmist David is asking
[26:02] the Lord a lot of times to quit in him
[26:06] one time is it quickly to your way one
[26:10] time he says quickened me to you word so
[26:13] he knew that he was dated and needed to
[26:17] be quickly are made alive time so is it
[26:20] now here look it on second Peter let's
[26:24] give me first Peter he's gives you
[26:26] scriptures name we'll get back on grip
[26:28] our point first Peter 317
[26:43] use me that three and 17 by myself it
[26:49] must be second Peter 3 and 17b now he's
[26:52] talking about it the Jesus Christ was
[26:55] quicker oh yeah okay I'm just looking to
[27:02] first 17 where Christ also has once
[27:06] suffered for sins the just for the
[27:09] unjust that he might bring us to God
[27:12] being put to death in the spirit and the
[27:15] flesh but quick under by the spirit he
[27:19] went to preach to the souls that were in
[27:21] prison hunter and quickening power
[27:23] that's why I asked you two to listen to
[27:26] the message or a reader of the it's the
[27:28] rising of the Sun because brother
[27:29] branham spends all of his time on that
[27:32] message covering the things of the
[27:34] quickening power C and covering it he
[27:38] covers it like this on page ten number
[27:41] two in your notes they gave it to you
[27:42] from Easter seal that we are quickly to
[27:45] eternal life right now we were quickly
[27:51] to eternal life because there's no need
[27:55] of talking about the body and it's redic
[27:59] shin until you see the soul and it's
[28:03] redic because it's got to work from
[28:05] the inside of it see because I said the
[28:09] Prophet citizen only the predestinated
[28:12] are considered in prediction are the
[28:15] only the predestinated are to be
[28:17] quickened the cause nobody else can't be
[28:20] you can't quickened you got to quicken
[28:23] the person from death to life before you
[28:25] can consider what even Paul is talking
[28:28] about it or you can understand anything
[28:31] we've got to come to the new verb and
[28:34] get into the new ver SI then we can see
[28:37] that not only now does that you
[28:42] birth quicken that soul and give you
[28:44] eternal life hmm it also now listen
[28:52] quickens Paul said your mortal body all
[28:57] right now you said what now we're still
[29:01] the same person after were born again so
[29:03] you would have said that if I hadn't
[29:04] come to that point that place is but it
[29:06] that's our thoughts uh-huh that's true
[29:09] we're the same person in body but when
[29:13] God came in to live in you and I by the
[29:17] new birth Paul carries it not on to the
[29:21] change you know that's wonderful and
[29:24] that'll be there but he carries it to
[29:26] the fact that we are already quickly and
[29:31] our mortal body limit well it's just
[29:35] getting older this is new everyone still
[29:37] having problems and still havin book see
[29:39] you're looking at the wrong thing you're
[29:43] looking at circumstances instead of
[29:45] looking at what God says then you
[29:47] understand why I've been trying to drive
[29:49] the point when you've got that new verb
[29:52] get quickened your soul to eternal life
[29:55] right all right that's easy to follow
[29:59] but since see we read in the scriptures
[30:01] that it quicken your mortal body why
[30:07] would you be sitting here tonight I'll
[30:09] just going to that part of it if God
[30:11] hadn't equipment you right you still be
[30:16] back in organized religion wouldn't you
[30:17] right right see he quickened us to this
[30:21] message that's the quickening power the
[30:26] Prophet we're talking about on the
[30:27] surrounding the Sun see he quickened us
[30:30] to the match
[30:31] to the hour what would we be if he had
[30:35] the quicken in the word that he had to
[30:37] made allowed to us the word we would
[30:40] still be sitting out there carrying the
[30:42] baptist bible Presbyterian Bolivar
[30:44] Pentecostal Bob or whatever you know
[30:47] believe in their doctrine if he had
[30:51] acquitted you so they were already
[30:54] started you remember I gave it to young
[30:56] on the future home we run around said
[30:58] you're growing on I'll give you that
[31:00] Treasury town you know then the epson
[31:02] who is this Melchizedek where he said
[31:04] it's already started so the day you
[31:09] receive the new birth that quickening
[31:12] power not only did it quicken the
[31:15] disciples right to the basis that they
[31:20] you know receive eternal life equipping
[31:23] their whole more of beings were at one
[31:25] time they were scared to go out me they
[31:31] were afraid to go out on that upper room
[31:34] but when that Holy Ghost game they go
[31:36] talking out of it she not only did
[31:40] equipment isn't prophetess said over and
[31:42] over is what equipment their tongues
[31:45] till have spoken languages other tongues

[32:24] actually picked up his body right then
[32:30] we we talk about it you've been through
[32:32] things if you read those messages when
[32:35] you hear right around st. Martin says
[32:37] everything Elijah had died and they
[32:40] buried in you don't you know owns no
[32:44] rotten everything rotting away with
[32:46] nothing but dust man they're carrying a
[32:48] dead man long dead had a battle and they
[32:52] didn't want a Hummer couldn't run where
[32:54] clash with him so they just throw him
[32:55] over in the grave you know probably

[33:01] know in burien sometime he was dead they
[33:05] just throw him over in there we are what
[33:07] he laude probably outrun them right

[33:39] quickening the bodies those in the Old
[33:45] Testament didn't have eternal life right
[33:48] in their soul right there were only a
[33:51] noise teeth right you see the quickening
[33:54] power striking them so much until great
[33:57] things would take place looking enum you
[33:59] just walked off here mine because that
[34:04] quickening power of Almighty God what
[34:08] about David I'll kill the line I killed
[34:11] a bear and that try to be insane if they
[34:15] right right why the coating you were a
[34:17] standing right d he could feel the power
[34:23] of God the anointing upon him what about
[34:28] Samson see even doing well they're being
[34:32] a blind man having to be laying around
[34:34] when you reach back and caught hold in
[34:35] locks he found out that hair was growing
[34:39] they just made a mistake oh they thought
[34:41] well he's blind to eat no no good like
[34:43] this the hair grow back out with that
[34:48] quickening power so strong on him until
[34:50] he just recent after building this food
[34:52] at name quickening power what about the
[34:58] 300 children come into the fiery furnace
[35:00] a bed so much quickening power tool only
[35:03] thing got burned with the things that
[35:05] take to hide your hands with pictured
[35:11] something talking about on the body man
[35:13] hey we are quicken to eternal life by
[35:17] the new birth David Nepal is not
[35:20] covering that in the Romans of what
[35:22] we're saying he's trying to explain to
[35:27] give an understanding that he had to us
[35:31] out there to wit the redemption of the
[35:33] body in other words how short a place
[35:38] and he takes place by the Spirit of God
[35:41] is dwelling within you and then we must
[35:44] come to a place to see the dog who he
[35:49] home
[35:52] yeah mm no see many a call but your
[35:58] children but the few chosen is what
[36:02] Paul's talking about right not too many
[36:06] this column he told like to feel their
[36:08] joke he comes with children in him I see
[36:13] then Paul goes owners are set to trying
[36:16] then that in that new birth me will come
[36:25] something that will bring us to a place
[36:27] of an understanding that if we're
[36:30] justified then we're already glorified
[36:39] we're already good at that but can we
[36:42] say what God's sake that's hard to do
[36:46] some time right you r avensis it to you
[36:51] couldn't really even hardly say the
[36:52] words I'm healed which are
[36:59] then people say no no not brother to him
[37:02] I don't want to say I'm healed because
[37:04] I'm not healed and I'd be lying what
[37:06] forget it then because you're right
[37:07] you're lying you but you're aligned when
[37:10] you don't say what God said because God
[37:13] says you're healed they said to brother
[37:15] Brown should run around you told em
[37:16] people her heel he said I told her what
[37:18] to buy you said back at this
[37:23] year thus saith the Lord you'll be
[37:25] reading right out of the safe the Lord
[37:26] by straps your heel because the thing we
[37:30] got to do is what put our sales dire
[37:33] right see then Paul is not talking about
[37:37] just the quickening of the newer and
[37:41] brother branham is not talking about
[37:42] just the quickening of the new birth he
[37:45] covers that in this arrived in the Sun
[37:46] Easter sealed and all of those message
[37:48] related he's talking about the
[37:52] quickening of this body right as I said
[37:56] a moment ago then look where you've been
[37:58] look where you came from what brought
[38:01] you from there to here well I just got
[38:05] fed up with that mess it up and I seen
[38:07] it it's kind of Lux brother said it but
[38:15] rent oldest person said you had to fight
[38:17] your way all the way to Jefferson
[38:18] Building so the brother went to him and
[38:20] asked him he said what happened he
[38:21] differed he's not got in the car and
[38:23] drove up back let's see for the rest if
[38:26] you had to fight your way all the way
[38:27] there's no telling what went on in the
[38:30] way of trying to stop him but he just
[38:32] didn't realize that he's one right knee
[38:35] quickening power quickening power to
[38:40] quicken the moral right the week and
[38:45] father will talk about the eternal life
[38:47] we're talking about we've got eternal
[38:50] life because see if we talked about
[38:51] having
[38:52] a lot then we're taking over hey I've
[38:56] got it made you know if I die I'm still
[39:01] all right I've got my cuz i got eternal
[39:05] lot and that's fine but you know
[39:08] somebody you're not gonna be able to
[39:10] have to undo like that we can't honky
[39:13] doing that way somebody's gotta say i'm
[39:20] already regained right somebody's got to
[39:24] say I'm already changed before God can
[39:28] make it come to pass right and it don't
[39:30] take but one person come on now you know
[39:33] what that's all they took in the days a
[39:36] week alright for heinous to fulfill all
[39:39] of the Bible he just walked off the
[39:41] earth huh she didn't we ought to be to
[39:45] the basis of trying to to say listen
[39:47] he's already quicken these mortal bodies
[39:51] now if you read the notes I get in there
[39:54] you'll hear the prophet saying like this
[39:55] specially who's this Mel Chesney he said
[39:58] we used to be in sin I get you know I
[40:05] get kind of ticked off at all of us I
[40:07] said all of us we spend more time
[40:09] talking about how sinful we was and what
[40:13] we come from then talking about the God
[40:16] that brought us from there no we want to
[40:20] glorify more the flesh than we do that
[40:23] the God that saved us you I think it's
[40:27] time to get away from that and get onto
[40:30] the basis that that we see God in His
[40:33] reveal word hmm
[40:38] and follow that to see the quickening
[40:41] power is to quicken these mortal body
[40:44] you remember when you used to live for
[40:46] the devil right maybe not big there's
[40:53] some among us that probably never went
[40:55] out and drank tour smolder are our
[40:58] committed adultery our are all kind of
[41:01] thing nice yeah I'll tell you this good
[41:05] money and its really good one with the
[41:07] to Bible study the other day and the
[41:09] topic came up and and they came up about
[41:11] the kiss being potential adult or
[41:13] something came up like that and I said
[41:14] well I can't raise my hand to say I
[41:16] never kissed nobody until I married you
[41:20] know we know we got a couple set among
[41:22] the suppressor name that they've never
[41:26] kissed nobody that's but their part

[41:34] thing at that Bobby Monica shake hands
[41:39] with him praise God for me you know what
[41:43] that means kids at means you can do it
[41:46] that means you don't have to view it on
[41:49] that stat right amen I thank God I
[41:53] rejoiced when they said that because see
[41:55] that's a right funny I can't say it and
[41:59] take him but listen quickening us from
[42:04] the things we used to do
[42:09] and you know when we were in cm we
[42:11] followed sin right we done like
[42:16] everybody else and I said maybe not on
[42:18] the biggest degree I never did drink cuz
[42:20] I didn't want to me I just didn't want
[42:24] to but that see that didn't make me a
[42:26] better person it just made me one that I
[42:28] didn't have to you know I can tell you
[42:30] that you don't have to believe I hall
[42:33] people in my own car take them over to
[42:35] get the beards doesn't bring back set
[42:36] amount still one drink because I just
[42:40] didn't want to what you see my point is
[42:47] kids you don't have to do that what I've
[42:53] heard all the risky i'll talk about you
[42:55] have to learn the Life Drain dear why do
[43:02] you want drank something it don't taste
[43:03] right the first time if I gotta learn a
[43:09] lot in the dragon I don't get me some
[43:14] water
[43:16] but listen think about the night you
[43:20] think about where you came from no think
[43:25] about in your life what you came from
[43:29] think of the situation's of life and how
[43:32] lost you work
[43:39] you don't have a problem doing that
[43:41] booty I don't have any problem thinking
[43:45] about what he used to do do you well
[43:49] think about it in me you see God saved
[43:53] you from that when he gave you the new
[43:57] birth eat quick on that mortal body in
[44:03] it made you quit you don't do those
[44:08] things anymore and I'm going to follow
[44:13] you on tumblr what's he bringing them up
[44:15] a little higher right now why do you
[44:18] claim the new birth I don't cuz i'm
[44:19] receiving you birthday for coming in to
[44:21] mention but a lot of you climb the new
[44:23] birth back before then and i agree with
[44:25] it and it's fine hun all right but you
[44:30] remember when you had the new verb that
[44:34] the churches you were in didn't teach
[44:37] against things right come on sisters you
[44:44] cut your hair painted your face now i'm
[44:47] giving you the out of it to say that you
[44:51] were ignorant of the truth and you tell
[44:55] me you receive the Holy Ghost back
[44:56] better that's fine I believe we my point
[45:01] is this because listen to I'm sayin see
[45:05] you done no signs because you were
[45:08] ignorant to the truth and it was not
[45:11] talk to you that it was wrong to do that
[45:15] till you were not done it men and women
[45:17] both all of them but you see when you
[45:21] come in with this message did this
[45:25] message become a book a room that we had
[45:29] to stop them touch
[45:34] did it become a book of rules and we had
[45:36] to quit doing things or is it the
[45:41] opening of the word that quickened our
[45:46] mortal bodies amen see we're going we
[45:49] want to wait quick and over there until
[45:51] it's finally changed it won't be changed
[45:54] if it's not quick an eye on right I gave
[45:58] you that free quotes and I would run
[45:59] around city that that Holy Spirit
[46:02] quickened us to the word we come suits
[46:06] under subjection to the word Griffin to
[46:13] the word that when we heard it maybe
[46:19] sometimes we quit because somebody told
[46:22] us you were to see me it was my family
[46:26] car I had a beautiful 1956 bill our
[46:30] sports coupe scoot chevrolet no one you
[46:34] know I I had it hand-painted and we've
[46:36] done everything to it but it was my car
[46:37] I didn't figure out what the hippie but
[46:42] the first church i went to then there
[46:43] comes that hippie driving his over his
[46:45] fancy little car what you know what I
[46:49] sold it maybe I wasn't a legalistic
[46:54] phone but I didn't want him to keep
[46:56] talking about my fancy little you know
[46:59] hippie car you know young person in his
[47:03] little car he was my family cars all
[47:06] that I could afford I finally sold it
[47:10] not me a big o 88 oldsmobile four-door
[47:13] well you know they did quit talking
[47:16] about my hippie car me
[47:20] would you understand what I'm getting at
[47:22] maybe sometimes we put a lot of things
[47:25] before it's revealed to us right I
[47:30] remember mr. Tatum and somebody kid we
[47:33] were who the other person was but they
[47:35] were talking about you know they had to
[47:38] dress this right and everything because
[47:39] there was a certain brother said he's
[47:41] coming through and said he'll preach
[47:43] against it you know he said we'd but her
[47:46] dress ride tonight because he'd go
[47:47] preach against it well I was alright
[47:50] that was commendable and respectable you
[47:53] know but see have we been quickened to
[47:57] the word are easy to book a room as our
[48:01] understanding been open as to what men
[48:04] and women should be and look like and
[48:06] and live like an act like right is it
[48:09] just opened our understanding or is it a
[48:11] revelation in our heart which one is
[48:16] good now you know yourself what I'm
[48:18] fixin safe right did you seen a lot of
[48:21] people's Wars it would reveal to them
[48:23] about how to live what to do not to do
[48:30] that sign people back sleeve and they
[48:34] went back to doing those things but now
[48:38] that was no revelation
[48:41] wouldn't a revelation now if it was
[48:43] revelation they wouldn't went back doing
[48:44] in the rocky bad food if there's a
[48:47] revelation and when to back slid him not
[48:51] as far as easily but you know it's true
[48:54] yeah the people that preached a lot of
[48:57] things out of our home when I was coming
[49:00] into the message there in 66 and 66 67
[49:03] and on him a lot of things it was
[49:06] preached against that people turn around
[49:08] rattling right back to it and even worse
[49:13] let's get up making a difference like I
[49:16] said maybe sometimes we just quit things
[49:18] on our own you ever heard Brett already
[49:22] set like this he said now your sisters
[49:24] cause you got along her long dresses he
[49:26] said don't think that that makes you a
[49:28] Christian little bird so evidently he
[49:30] must have note somebody must know that a
[49:32] lot of them had that for a reason or
[49:35] other than the fact of being converted
[49:41] but get the point what I'm saying even
[49:43] after becoming Christians the opening of
[49:48] the word this what quickens this right
[49:52] we're looking at it as an anointing of
[49:54] the Spirit to come down see quickening
[49:58] someone more till the spirit to come
[50:01] down the upon us when I thought it was
[50:06] supposed to be from the inside I thought
[50:08] its what i was trying to get across to
[50:10] you very heavy sunday that it spoke to
[50:12] me from the inside me and that's the
[50:16] only way the change will ever come the
[50:19] plenty of people preaches it one day
[50:21] that's anointing going to fall and it's
[50:23] going to change us everybody rejoice
[50:27] glory hallelujah from one day course if
[50:32] you lay em down on it and like I said
[50:33] about somebody say old the Lord's coming
[50:35] in you say yep real close now this is
[50:38] the Nelson but now nobody knows are
[50:40] there
[50:40] summer but maybe 50 years from now
[50:42] because they're thinking they're gonna
[50:44] be dead well is that the way the people
[50:47] are the man's me screaming and hollering
[50:53] and can do it you know know about things
[50:57] and then see the way they turn I
[51:01] remember when we went up to a certain
[51:03] brother's place and was having a
[51:05] minister's meeting guard we walked into
[51:07] his house brother dick had come from a
[51:09] place to word it took the pastor was
[51:12] pretty strong against Christmas trees
[51:14] and he walked in an hour set one in the
[51:16] brothers house all decorated and he
[51:18] looked at me and he said brother so much
[51:20] I'd like to be here me but you know what
[51:23] it's like I told him I know brother
[51:25] sewing stuff same one I said you let
[51:28] them do babies come along oh they got
[51:31] all man they swore he would never do
[51:33] that I said you let them babies come
[51:35] along well when the wife got pregnant
[51:38] first thing it was now i'm not gonna say
[51:40] nothing this year next year anyone I'm
[51:46] not throwing off home buddy
[51:49] because what is for that might be a
[51:52] small little playing me trying to get my
[51:54] two fingers you know compared to apply
[51:56] of you and I talking right knee I'm just
[52:03] talking about what the Prophet said much
[52:05] about will take back the Bible didn't
[52:08] say it would just quicken the show and
[52:10] then we give us a new body no the same
[52:15] man that tells us about the quickening
[52:18] of the soul says it why we are mortal
[52:21] mortal you know right in these elements
[52:25] we're living in that we can be quickened
[52:28] are made alive and don't have to live
[52:31] like that anymore but is it just a quote
[52:38] and we say we as we drank all the liquor
[52:40] we want to we smoke all we want to we
[52:42] didn't it is that just a quote of some
[52:44] kind or is that some kind of a hot tub
[52:46] situation to try to encourage other
[52:48] people are discouraged or the beam or
[52:49] something is it real right quick and our
[52:55] mortal bodies did you think that's easy
[53:00] to look just keep looking out there and
[53:02] so when a under it so much under so much
[53:04] other one day I'll get out there one day
[53:07] I'll reach it you know like the the
[53:09] carrot in front of don't keeps pulling
[53:11] the love you but the Bible doesn't talk
[53:15] about that Paul didn't speak like head
[53:19] news brother Brandon Paul said we're
[53:23] already glorified Paul said we was
[53:26] chosen in him before the foundation of
[53:29] the world that's right and they were
[53:30] already justified and we're already
[53:34] glorified I'm looking something brother
[53:36] Brennan said today he said you know
[53:38] another word funny part razor cutter
[53:40] can't remember exact wording but he was
[53:42] saying it like this if we were justified
[53:45] glorified before the world and that's
[53:47] according to the Bible and according to
[53:48] him then we didn't have anything do it
[53:58] didn't he jump but wait a minute at four
[54:01] no she looked down through your frigate
[54:03] no you ain't listening if God glorified
[54:09] you before the world ever begun it could
[54:12] not be on the place is what you do or
[54:15] don't do because at that time you hadn't
[54:18] done it oh that right will foundational
[54:28] world you had done it so it couldn't be
[54:30] this based on together on what we call
[54:32] for knowledge for knowledge is the for
[54:38] knowledge or what will transpire d
[54:40] predestinated according to his word
[54:50] when I finished on predestination that
[54:52] is I got a little bit on something I
[54:54] don't move off of it because Satan get
[54:56] on our way people don't understand that
[54:58] I've tried to explain that to ministers
[54:59] that's what you see these doctors appear
[55:01] from but if you'll go along jump up with
[55:03] that get on something else get it fit
[55:05] around good night while you come back
[55:07] and you just get in it go a little bit
[55:09] that way Satan can't keep up with now
[55:12] you wouldn't understand the excellent
[55:14] maybe I don't need to say it but it's
[55:16] just a way to do I dropped off a
[55:19] predestination got over onto another
[55:21] topic and going on a little bit now but
[55:24] listen church he quickened us to the
[55:31] truth right he quickened us to this
[55:36] message right as I said most of you
[55:40] claim the new burger a lot of you claim
[55:42] that you were before you come into the
[55:44] message right and that can be you when
[55:53] he quickened Jeep to the message man
[55:55] that's right hmm they were sister Gayle
[55:58] her statement would don't tell me I will
[56:00] be responsible can you see that was our
[56:03] day that was our time I don't have to be
[56:05] responsible if I don't know it so don't
[56:07] tell me what you see we've been quickly
[56:13] we came out of organized religion huh
[56:20] because we were quickened that's right
[56:25] quickened by the word to see that it was
[56:27] wrong we love the people but we don't
[56:35] love the doctrines anymore huh that we
[56:38] were quickly to the word and we don't
[56:42] love what we used to love no more than
[56:46] we love the sin that we used to see them
[56:48] I hope you understand my point see when
[56:52] we come into message we didn't jump in
[56:54] this message and even the day you come
[56:56] into mesh and receive the Holy Ghost and
[56:58] everything lined up that's what people
[57:00] think they're you know they don't want
[57:03] to talk to me because my memory at 71
[57:05] years old it's feel too good this old
[57:09] boy when I first heard it at its line
[57:10] right up when I thought Lord God help me
[57:14] because it's taken me 40 years to try to
[57:18] get lined up well you're just slow well
[57:22] I'm talking about those that said they
[57:24] died in just a minute because they're
[57:26] with me too I can remember all of it I'm
[57:32] trying to talk to people about things
[57:34] they were doing it wasn't right
[57:36] according to the Bible but you see when
[57:39] we get over on the other side it's easy
[57:41] to say you know but I just lined up
[57:43] immediately no the quickening power
[57:47] comes on a gradual basis as to the word
[57:50] because it's when the word is revealed
[57:52] now it's the quickening power it is not
[57:56] when you read it it is not when you even
[57:59] agree with it right lorenz that people
[58:02] will sympathize with the message
[58:06] yeah you know what sympathize with it is
[58:09] nowhere to go along with it but did this
[58:13] won't step on over into it see the
[58:16] quickening power where are you at
[58:19] tonight my in Luna Georgia me what
[58:29] brought you here what keeps you here is
[58:36] it just a place to go to church there's
[58:38] a lot of a whole lot closer to you film
[58:39] I want to believe it's a quickening
[58:45] power Nick quickens us to the word that
[58:49] we here and then we get hungry because
[58:52] we you're more that's what's wrong with
[58:55] the people of the message right no it's
[58:58] a bad illustration but I've always tried
[59:00] to tell you you know you if you're
[59:01] feeding an old calendar Jordan Rachel
[59:04] Rachel special get anyways gets back cuz
[59:07] you know she told me put so much thing
[59:09] into feeding her chickens and rabbits
[59:11] and dogs well they're gonna be without
[59:13] food when they get back good I thank you
[59:18] hungry
[59:19] I for the last three thank you Wow
[59:25] because that's the way I am in the
[59:27] gospel but I've told you don't story
[59:31] about you know you got a cow she's
[59:32] getting one bale of hay and that's all
[59:33] she's gotten 20 years later she's still
[59:35] eatin one bill honey well something
[59:37] happens the truck and father bear father
[59:38] office you get too available boy she
[59:40] swings he loves she's getting fat and
[59:42] she's hit and that's what people are
[59:45] that's why they don't want to come
[59:46] around Lucy they don't want them to hear
[59:48] the word that comes from Lulu because
[59:50] the afraid that they're gonna get taste
[59:57] of two bales of hay and that won't come
[59:59] do it at night and but i think it's the
[1:00:02] quickening power that brought us all
[1:00:04] together right right right i think it's
[1:00:08] the quickening power of this going to
[1:00:10] put the bride in the rapture and we're
[1:00:13] not talking about those who go by the
[1:00:15] grave they are waiting on us to come to
[1:00:18] the place that that file quickening
[1:00:20] power cuz i was looking for that
[1:00:22] dressing one day God willing on a church
[1:00:27] hmm he said she'll do in one year what
[1:00:30] the I'll just try to do in two thousand
[1:00:32] but said she doing it now see we don't
[1:00:35] want to quote that just what I'm trying
[1:00:37] to tell you the day you got the new
[1:00:39] earth that quickening power started
[1:00:42] tweeting that body it's just been
[1:00:44] quickness to stop sinning it quickens us
[1:00:47] to the message that's right its
[1:00:50] greatness to the reveal word as we walk
[1:00:54] in the message yeah that's right
[1:00:57] and it makes us hungry for more word
[1:01:00] that's right the quickening power
[1:01:04] probably see it I gave you one quote in
[1:01:07] our research shoot it burn it do
[1:01:09] anything you want to he says you can't
[1:01:11] destroy it dad there's no way to destroy
[1:01:16] the quickening power but you see what
[1:01:20] I'm talking about we're looking at a
[1:01:22] quickening power like it's something
[1:01:24] that's got to be some anointing to come
[1:01:26] down what is your profit say the
[1:01:31] anointing is supreme power in control
[1:01:37] that's right nah Jesus locks into the
[1:01:43] temple one day takes the Bible stands up
[1:01:46] and read this day this scripture is
[1:01:49] fulfilled goes over and set down no
[1:01:57] running screaming hollering no greater
[1:01:59] than wanting to light shining flashing
[1:02:01] right the greatest anointing that had
[1:02:04] ever been in the world was sitting that
[1:02:07] the most quickening power that this
[1:02:10] world had ever seen was sitting in that
[1:02:12] seat and who understood that that was
[1:02:16] what was going on I believe in it I'm
[1:02:21] looking forward to it the profits in one
[1:02:23] of these days there will be such a
[1:02:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll come
[1:02:26] from heaven distracting this bride
[1:02:27] little file fill every fiber of our of
[1:02:30] our meeting and we'll go in the rats
[1:02:31] right I'm looking for that but if we're
[1:02:35] not lined up with the quickening power
[1:02:37] to become a Christian to begin a widow
[1:02:39] sin of our daily lives and walking like
[1:02:41] the only things we didn't understand if
[1:02:43] it's didn't quickness to the message and
[1:02:45] brought us to the basis of the word that
[1:02:48] this message is the important thing in
[1:02:50] our lives because in this message is the
[1:02:55] change of the body
[1:02:56] what I'm trying to get you see Paul was
[1:02:58] telling us about the change he was
[1:03:05] telling us if we could just realize were
[1:03:08] justified and see really what God is
[1:03:14] talking about a justification you
[1:03:19] remember I told you read invisible Union
[1:03:21] you hear the Prophet explaining it he's
[1:03:23] explaining justification but he's
[1:03:25] explained it in three stages stage one
[1:03:28] you get justified chops occupy sins
[1:03:30] stage to you come to a place that it
[1:03:36] says though you never done it stage
[1:03:41] three he says the real you never did too
[1:03:51] now how much can we do and talk about as
[1:03:55] I said a moment ago other things that
[1:03:57] we've done in life will you realize that
[1:04:01] God shall justify that until he showed
[1:04:07] you one day that you fear from that then
[1:04:12] you begin to open up the world and to us
[1:04:14] to show us fit you know we done it but
[1:04:18] God has put it in the seal forgetfulness
[1:04:21] never to be remembered against us what
[1:04:26] you see then it comes to a stage of
[1:04:27] seeing the real you never to do
[1:04:34] what is the real you for the great
[1:04:36] that's soul that's within you that come
[1:04:40] from God just a real youth that's right
[1:04:44] right okay well you know if that show
[1:04:47] come from God is come and dwell in this
[1:04:49] body then I'm not going to get another
[1:04:53] body he laid claim on this one and he's
[1:04:57] going to work away and maybe that's not
[1:04:59] a good term of doing but he's going to
[1:05:01] make away that I can walk into that
[1:05:04] place the glorification can be here upon
[1:05:08] this earth could we're going to be
[1:05:10] changed here the Prophet said we cannot
[1:05:13] did you hear him in the quick do its
[1:05:16] rise to the Sun for shirts in that he
[1:05:19] said we can't meet God in these bodies
[1:05:23] he said these bodies are sin but now
[1:05:29] what's he saying their product of sin he
[1:05:36] said we're gonna have to have that new
[1:05:38] body to meet him in the air not another
[1:05:42] body this body make new and go meet him
[1:05:46] in the air so then we got to be dealing
[1:05:50] with the changes being here don't think
[1:05:55] you've changed you going up in the air
[1:05:56] somewhere and you're gonna start out you
[1:05:59] know fat and ugly no no
[1:06:07] then we're going to go out so far we're
[1:06:09] just going to start fading down do we
[1:06:11] get to the 1820 and on then we're gonna
[1:06:15] be yep my looking young you know I way
[1:06:17] that's what happened at Ground Zero I've
[1:06:20] told you what I thought I believe
[1:06:23] Abraham woke up one morning and he
[1:06:26] looked over there and he said I'm in bad
[1:06:31] shape cuz I feel young more laying over
[1:06:35] here and I'm an old man what did i do
[1:06:37] last night I dropped it I get then you
[1:06:44] look this Sam is that you
[1:06:50] she looks gorgeous Abraham is that you i
[1:06:56] believe it was done so quick until they
[1:06:59] didn't know anything about if you get on
[1:07:00] it's nothing to be something that you
[1:07:02] just keep on going you finally get this
[1:07:03] way you know the way i think a lot of
[1:07:05] people thought somebody turn left it
[1:07:06] starts with the good works its way out
[1:07:08] through this way not this way cuz they
[1:07:10] know the prophet said it comes me inside
[1:07:11] out but i don't think that away i don't
[1:07:13] think you were that right I think it's
[1:07:16] the word reveal to you have it if I
[1:07:20] don't get nothing to use enough to get
[1:07:22] one time this word made alive it's the
[1:07:27] quickening power that I'm talking about
[1:07:28] Abbott we have the dynamic I mean the
[1:07:33] mechanics in the basis of the word
[1:07:35] showdown in our heart yet but we need to
[1:07:37] make the dynamics for that word that we
[1:07:39] have sold down in our heart I agree we
[1:07:43] young man I know that that's what we're
[1:07:44] having we need to quickening to do that
[1:07:48] but it won't be done just at one time
[1:07:50] right it's on the gradual basis God
[1:07:56] doesn't we case we couldn't stand it and
[1:08:00] what would be wonderful wouldn't it to
[1:08:02] be sitting somewhere god that's open the
[1:08:04] entire Bible that we can see everything
[1:08:06] I would be wonderful but he can't do
[1:08:07] that human mind couldn't comprehend it
[1:08:09] couldn't stand it so it does real slow
[1:08:12] and gradual sure he's open our
[1:08:17] understanding we talk about we
[1:08:18] understand one God we understand water
[1:08:22] baptism we understand no eternal hell we
[1:08:24] understand marriage and divorce we can
[1:08:25] quote quote quote quote quote but how
[1:08:27] much of that has been revealed right
[1:08:29] yeah
[1:08:36] how much is that Ben Revere can we
[1:08:41] handle like the Prophet would say then
[1:08:44] yeah here comes to former rain the
[1:08:51] teaching of the word he said then the
[1:08:55] latter rain falls to quicken that then
[1:08:59] one day he turns around he followed that
[1:09:01] line of thinking all the way you know
[1:09:03] former rain didn't latter rain former
[1:09:06] rained in later on then one day he said
[1:09:10] it like this he said here comes the
[1:09:12] latter rain with a former rain on it I
[1:09:17] don't understand what you're saying very
[1:09:21] simple what we received the night
[1:09:24] tomorrow what we received the quickening
[1:09:29] power of the understanding of the word
[1:09:30] tonight tomorrow is another day it
[1:09:35] becomes a form of rain so I'm giving you
[1:09:40] some form of rain are you listening the
[1:09:47] next match of yourself some form a rain
[1:09:55] look up what it means by glorification
[1:09:58] look up what it means glorified I don't
[1:10:02] want you to raise your hands II haven't
[1:10:03] have you done it but look at it you
[1:10:07] might find out the profit is right when
[1:10:10] he says what is this great translation
[1:10:18] most important question or doubt that
[1:10:22] anyone could ever let me put this way
[1:10:24] the most important question that I can
[1:10:26] ever find in the message anywhere did
[1:10:28] anybody ask you now I'm not the wealth
[1:10:31] only other questions but that was to me
[1:10:35] was a seal sign definite question come
[1:10:38] from a person it really wanted to and he
[1:10:44] suggested check
[1:10:48] just to check
[1:10:52] did he explains it all how do we get
[1:10:58] this understanding of the reduction in
[1:11:01] the body it's just a chain if the spirit
[1:11:07] that was in him being you it will
[1:11:12] quicken your mortal body they will turn
[1:11:16] you from sin I told you this I didn't
[1:11:20] get in all that because you can just
[1:11:21] take and read it read down through there
[1:11:23] the matter of fact the v8's chapter read
[1:11:26] a very therefore now no condemnation
[1:11:27] till they walk not after placement
[1:11:30] that's the spirit no coming down read on
[1:11:32] it's dealing with flesh and Paul comes
[1:11:35] to a basis there in Romans about six or
[1:11:37] somewhere in there these are the things
[1:11:39] i would i do not the things i do i would
[1:11:41] not you know get all laughing me he was
[1:11:44] simply explaining that the outside man
[1:11:46] was wanting to fly after the law of the
[1:11:50] flesh but the inside man was wanting the
[1:11:53] fire after the law of the spirit and he
[1:11:55] had a war continually that's right is
[1:11:59] that not where we read and that is there
[1:12:02] not a war in your life
[1:12:10] come on is there not a war in your life
[1:12:12] that's going home I told you that was so
[1:12:16] much talk then until the badges touted
[1:12:19] that Paul was born again he was trying
[1:12:23] to explain it over Oh his already born
[1:12:27] again he's explaining what we do pulse
[1:12:37] it then with the law of god I serve the
[1:12:42] inner man but he said with the law of
[1:12:45] the flesh he wouldn't say it he
[1:12:49] automatically yielded to the flesh no he
[1:12:52] was saying that we are automatically in
[1:12:54] the flesh and our following after the
[1:12:58] flesh the Bible says we need to mortify
[1:13:03] the deeds of the body is that right make
[1:13:09] tonight the deeds of the body to bring
[1:13:12] ourselves under subjection you mean
[1:13:15] we're going to get to a place when he
[1:13:16] Dave and I'm going to have any trouble
[1:13:17] no I'm sorry I never have agreed that we
[1:13:24] wouldn't agree that we would get to
[1:13:26] place it you know no we're human but
[1:13:32] we've got to get to a place to find out
[1:13:35] that is he that has chosen other stuff
[1:13:38] and that he's living in us and we have
[1:13:43] an advocate with the father or why would
[1:13:45] we need an advocate if we didn't do
[1:13:47] wrong
[1:13:51] my life 81 number other day you get me
[1:13:54] all confused now you've born that way I
[1:13:57] just expose your confusion take on these
[1:14:02] times me nothing Satan can do to take
[1:14:08] away from you what God's revealing that
[1:14:13] you can walk on what God is revealed to
[1:14:16] you Ava fill it did right you did right
[1:14:24] Elijah did quickening power
[1:14:38] does this say that I'll say it one more
[1:14:39] time with all that noise what people
[1:14:41] think about they think of quickening is
[1:14:42] some rushing mighty wind that drop down
[1:14:44] out of heaven David probably looked
[1:14:48] after when he was talking to Saul and
[1:14:53] you know what he put it on he's the day
[1:14:56] was a bear come after a one of my sheep
[1:14:58] and he said I rose up and killed it he
[1:15:03] said they was a line come in one day he
[1:15:07] said I just rose up and killed he said
[1:15:11] so will it be with that fist see he had
[1:15:17] no fear could I believe David was like
[1:15:22] this let me walk out there and face the
[1:15:26] time even if he kills me due to human
[1:15:32] mortal thinking bro he said when I
[1:15:37] barrel run out her naturally old blue
[1:15:39] secures the bear Milan's glad I was a
[1:15:43] little afraid of it I'm sure I realize
[1:15:46] that feller whole lot bigger at night

[1:16:05] right he was not afraid of anything
[1:16:09] folks the new birth the things that I've
[1:16:13] talked about the night coming into the
[1:16:15] message to receiving the opening of our
[1:16:17] understanding of the word of God to me
[1:16:19] out sitting our parade while ago what
[1:16:21] I'm gone if I miss it I'm happy I've
[1:16:25] seen what the prophets desire to look in
[1:16:28] to be happy about it yeah we're so down
[1:16:38] and out know at least these quick at me
[1:16:45] of that much right how much it we
[1:16:49] quicken folks because the quickening
[1:16:53] power i'm talking about it is how much
[1:16:54] word has been revealed not how much
[1:16:58] shouting glory hallelujah someone had
[1:17:00] come down another class and i believe in
[1:17:01] every bit of it you can't take away from
[1:17:04] me the things that I've seen and I've
[1:17:05] talked to you about it over the years do
[1:17:09] you know that I believe in the anointing
[1:17:11] I believe in see anything I believe in
[1:17:13] personal things but yet
[1:17:20] all that can be imitated but Satan
[1:17:26] cannot bring the word word by word
[1:17:33] that's what I depend on the quickening
[1:17:39] of the word is the quickening power than
[1:17:42] I desire go to me that's the dynamics to
[1:17:48] the mechanics
[1:17:55] do you have a lot of word late in you

[1:18:01] how reveal what's in my head the
[1:18:06] knowledge that I have for the message I
[1:18:07] left her to be revealed but you know he
[1:18:10] revealed as I have neither quickening
[1:18:15] power to quicken us from centers to
[1:18:18] Saints and that begin to work and the
[1:18:24] Prophet remember who is it smell charity

[1:18:31] to be reading it's already started the
[1:18:35] quickening power is already working
[1:18:37] within it to bring it to the right place
[1:18:43] walk in the word and the seed and isn't
[1:18:47] having the Prophet said he said walk in
[1:18:49] the word and watch it unfold the
[1:18:52] quickening powered up mr. home uses the
[1:18:56] quickening power
[1:19:00] it's already started they're at that's
[1:19:04] what I'm trying to tell you you see if I
[1:19:06] just to see anything if I just seen
[1:19:08] anything if I could see this the
[1:19:11] quickening power what else do you want

[1:19:57] every year
[1:20:01] the quickening power
[1:20:05] if it just quick way to probably say if
[1:20:08] God would just let me use it magnitude
[1:20:10] of God with quicken our understanding he
[1:20:12] said there's angels in this room right
[1:20:14] right you think that something happens
[1:20:19] and maybe you you think well I was
[1:20:21] really good Jeffrey in him they had a
[1:20:23] little incident one day I with the water
[1:20:27] on the road and it was the truck was
[1:20:29] were switching from side to side if
[1:20:31] they'd been anybody there they would you
[1:20:33] know you know who was that why don't we
[1:20:38] thank him for what we see he's trying to
[1:20:42] get us to recognize that he's here with
[1:20:46] us some people he opens her
[1:20:51] understanding enough to see it but you
[1:20:54] know what the Prophet said and I don't
[1:20:56] to make everybody in the building
[1:20:57] rejoice right I believe it I see that's
[1:21:03] really not believe it the quickening
[1:21:08] power to quicken us from dead mortal
[1:21:12] human beings to alive Christians that
[1:21:16] are living in bodies is going to be
[1:21:18] changed but it's already done as far as
[1:21:22] God is concerned right we just got to
[1:21:28] get whatever God says about it but what
[1:21:31] he says how can you say as far as he's
[1:21:34] concerned we got to get as far as he's
[1:21:35] concerned in us and honestly don't to
[1:21:38] make did we get as far as he's concerned
[1:21:39] in the side of us then you know it whips
[1:21:44] it like he sees will see angels will see
[1:21:49] beings

[1:27:23] for doctors we go through we do like
[1:27:26] they tell us outside of when it becomes
[1:27:29] wrong or harmful we do what they tell us
[1:27:32] to do that when we know and realize that
[1:27:34] a lot of time we've get harm out of
[1:27:35] things because they are practicing
[1:27:37] medicine they just but you know what I
[1:27:41] asked us is Lord and you know what I've
[1:27:42] got inside my who got to learn the
[1:27:44] medicine cabinet never told you

[1:28:04] with brightness ignored you know we
[1:28:06] believe you but just you use the doctor
[1:28:13] let his work I would maybe we know who
[1:28:17] the healer is well she'll tell you in a
[1:28:22] hurried painting she's been in for eight
[1:28:24] villages not all totally gone no but
[1:28:28] it's a lot better what I God we're not
[1:28:35] bragging about the doctors we're
[1:28:37] bragging about God cuz he's the one who
[1:28:40] takes care of everyone pray and ask God
[1:28:44] to say Lord let this work my brother Tom
[1:28:47] said dirt on ice and we're going along
[1:28:48] with your program what then you get in
[1:28:53] there you will find nothing well when
[1:28:55] they got in there they didn't find
[1:28:56] anything well that was wonderful Evan

[1:29:01] program thank God for any way that heals
[1:29:08] people swear and play biotechnol
[1:29:11] medicine but you let them get sick and
[1:29:12] heard enough and he'll take pain pills
[1:29:14] and everything else but not throwing off
[1:29:17] on the way it's being honest and
[1:29:20] straight do we know who the hero but
[1:29:26] around said God knew that we would need
[1:29:29] that in this life days because of the
[1:29:31] heart problems you know of your heart in
[1:29:35] that little natural bristle until he
[1:29:38] said God allowed them to bring that two
[1:29:41] pice because he knew we would need
[1:29:48] he's even though he was a prophet why
[1:29:53] didn't he say well now bless God now
[1:29:55] maybe you're not gonna go no doctor and
[1:29:58] get that growth taken out they were
[1:30:02] going to get it taken out God came on to
[1:30:08] see my god but the point is he's on his
[1:30:12] way why can't we believe in healing
[1:30:19] believe the doctors believing that thank
[1:30:21] God far yeah st. get away from our super
[1:30:28] duper faith to getting down to just
