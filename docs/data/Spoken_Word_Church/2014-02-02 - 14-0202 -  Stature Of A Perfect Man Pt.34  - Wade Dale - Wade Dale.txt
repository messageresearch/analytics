========================================

I'm gonna put on the the thing because I think you can hear me anyway so yeah all right all right if you turn that one off what the heater change what I have to go through just to get started welcome back anyway they didn't this didn't happen the last three Sundays good to be here yes the unique was reading Isaiah yeah he was reading Isaiah yeah and who has believed that report but it also goes along with it goes along with bearing song where he pierced my hands and my feet brother Brown used that several times but people not understanding what was going on but it took somebody that said been to Calgary which Peter I mean Philip had not been to Calgary but if you're born again you've been to Calgary that's right so and you understand what Calvary is so it took somebody with some understanding to tell that Ethiopian eunuch what was going on so uh if you got your Bibles turn back when you turn a second Peter we can read it right here because we got it on on the screen we kind of got all this where we can put it together now and and uh I can't I will use my iPad today I promise I've been using it out in the in the field so I hadn't been thanking everybody I've been thinking Everett been telling where it came from so so um thank you for uh again for getting it for me and I just don't have the little thingy that that I can use my iPad and it'll put it on screen yet but I will um I will purchase that just as soon as I can so but we're going to do it with the with a little one today so we're we're gonna go and going into patience I think temperance we pretty much got that covered because Temperance is out of control your temper how do not speak ill of somebody um we still need to work on all these things it's not something that you come to a uh a period on any of these it's always a comma it's a comma and we do these things and we add to our faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge it's always a continuous adding so but we have to come to a place though that that the Lord will show you that you do have Temperance that that what used to bother you doesn't bother you anymore well then praise God for that that's right you know praise God for those things when you come to him uh Brother Francis you can be in it you can know where you're at with God at any moment now that's your problem if you don't because if you don't you're not born again that's right if you're born again you'll see how God will take you from here to here to here to here and God's one is doing it not you that's right but if you're not born again then you're just you're believing unto that's okay you can be justified you can be Sanctified and you can have part of these because brother Brown said so there's people in the world not even born again that has some of these virtues but remember what we said before they're human virtues they're at virtue because of the genetic makeup of that family their genetic makeup of a family down in guildsville uh I'll not call their name but we're kin to them and thank God on the other side not on the Dale side we got enough temper herself but the whole the whole um Clan or the whole family is known to be violent cursing and beating each other up but they're known for that why because it came down through the genetic makeup and how that uh you know you see brother Brown he tells he tells stories about that that this this kid is because of something that happened because of the grandmother or the great grandfather or something happened way back Yonder right and then he come down through the generations and It produced like a redheaded child you have a redheaded child there's no redheaded children but if you check back four generations there was a redheaded in-law came in there you know married into the family and there's that g there's that Gene laying there and uh it comes to life like uh uh especially in the animal kingdom like deer with with uh you call a deer that looks all brown he's got a certain genetic makeup but there's some that are brown with white spots called pie ball well it takes a splitting of a gene from a mother and a father to make that well that's the same way with us we're just this is animal skin we're just animals uh we're no more than an animal if we're not born again we because of our because of the what God put that two seven man there to till the ground for brother Brown said that was animal one guy that was an animal and that's the same way with us so in these virtues you can have a certain amount of these virtues and not be born again um you can have patience we've seen people have patience they weren't even born again it was just part of their part of their makeup but remember this is Godly Faith Godly virtue Godly knowledge Godly Temperance Godly Godly patience so The Godly Temperance that we should have is is not to speak evil when spoken up not to rile up when you're riled against look at Jesus Christ he he had the greatest Temperance he showed one time as driving the people out of the out of the temple but of course he went and died for those same people so he had patience he had Temperance to to you know I mean if I was him if I was him and I walked in that Temple and they would berating me and calling me illegitimate and all that stuff I probably got a little worse than he did you understand what I mean every day he had to he had that question hanging over him in the Pharisees of course they had nothing in their Linens to to bother them so they were always berating him you know well sometimes he rubs on that nerve a little bit you know so but that's why Jesus is the example he never riled back when he was on a cross just like when we read there when he was on the cross he never Ronald he never remodeled back he never he never said father kill him all he said forgive him until they know not what they do I have a question about Temperance do you think and I'm serious here and Dad I don't throw plates and that kind of stuff I don't do that but I punch my teeth a lot after seeing him apart remember you can't help thinking bad thoughts either that's right you can't help but you know what the best thing to do is if you do think that said Lord forgive me and if those people are not safe save the people because they wouldn't do it if they were Christians they wouldn't do that they wouldn't do that to you if they were Christian but grit in your teeth I don't we do it to our children I'd like to bite my head off sometimes it would leave a bloody mess and I don't want to clean it up so but see that's where I need more Temperance but I do have more Temperance toward them than I used to best thing to do just not say anything that's right pray for him there's not listen nothing out of your mouth is going to save your children except prayer that's right nothing out of your mouth you know mama she bless her heart she's sitting here now so she's sitting here as a witness she used to every time get on the phone why don't you know at church you need to be Church you know you need a big church that honestly didn't do any good but Daddy hardly never said anything why he had a resolve and a Temperance and a patience like we're going to talk about today he got a patience to know that God said it and he's going to do it and that's it we'll see if we get to it in time Noah had to wait a hundred and twenty years 120 years and you know what God went and finished trying his patience he put him in the ark shut the door and had to wait seven more days with nothing no scientific evidence no Weather Channel which they messed up ask brother Joe and brother Bob and whoever else was out there in it wow I mean maybe uh it's like brother Joe you know what that storm and I don't know if anybody helped you or not but that storm that storm could have been predestinated by God and it was just so that somebody could help brother Joe and get eternalized yeah that's just one person here not just one person here I'm not talking about Christians all around the world that it happens to but we just had it happen brother Joe somebody brought him a sandwich somebody brought him a honey bun somebody brought him coffee somebody offered help well guess what yeah in the end the Bible said I'll not forget it here right or there right so brother Joe can stand up one day and say uh so-and-so help me yeah and God won't forget it so you see there and somebody who could have helped you I don't know but brother Joe's telling us last night but but people just having patience at that time yeah now can you imagine being stuck on 285 for a day and a half I can't stand it for 15 or 20 minutes and Bob being on the bus for eight hours and I'm sure they were all Christians and sat there and was really nice we won't talk about that same way with you brother Joe I'm sure that CB radio was full of bleep bleep from bleep bleep right I understand yes sir anyway uh if you've seen everyone something happens people get together and help each other but the rest of the time they followed them in there yeah right it depends on the situation when I saw that I thought man what's it going to be when we get out of here all right that's just a that's just a speck of what's going to happen all over this country when when this thing shuts down and maybe even before we leave here yeah we may have to go through some tribulations of of uh Sleeping in a church or sleeping in a car or you never know maybe God's preparing US foreign walked two hours in the snow to get home and and you can tell your children it was uphill both ways and you can tell them that it was you know this high if you want them and that's fine you know the old story is with what we used to watch School two miles every day at school and two feet of snow it was uphill both ways so kind of stretching the truth a little bit but these brothers went through something that maybe tried their patients a little bit maybe tried their Temperance a little bit mm-hmm came through yeah you know brother Joe came to her brother Joe's Meat calm guy and and Bobby is too and it may have been different with me may have been different than me I mean Danny would have probably commandeered a car somewhere but you see there there's where you know it's it's just things in your life but you know what got to do that to show you and then what the prophet said he'll do it to show you where you're at and you know he said if you fail the test it's just a redo you designed to do it over again so Bob and and brother Joe and brother Bob past it so Hallelujah they won't have to get stuck in traffic anymore for eight hours or 12 hours or or brother Joe's 30 something 20 something hours that leave bless his heart almost two days straight I got a little helicopter for Christmas but I couldn't pick you up with that place I was talking about helicoptering in and picking you up but let's get back but this is you know this is life lessons this is what we go through this is an everyday thing that we go through and and we stand it into Walmart and and line and and you got screaming babies behind you and you got people cursing in front of you that's right what are you gonna do about it you're going to get all upset you're going to get all frustrated and all you need to have patience you need to have Temperance you need to say God they just don't know you they just don't know you like I know you and then just turn it into a thanks right turn it into a thank you God that that you know and don't say like the Pharisees don't be the way like this because there's a fine line don't say I'm glad I'm not like that guy all right because you know what though if without the new birth you'd be just like that guy okay so you praise God at least he's showing you that you got the new birth that's right and that you're acting different but don't ever it's hard not okay but don't ever look down on people because you were there at one time before that's right and and God looks at all the same through the blood remember he only hears our Voice through the blood so he sees everybody the same Sinners and Saints through the blood but thank God he's given us a way of escape a way to get out of here a way to to pull us out of this junk and that's what he's doing and I've said it many times before Satan went into God's perfect Eden and messed it up now God's come down into Satan's perfect Eden and messing it up because I don't know how to handle you they won't know how to handle brother Bob or or brother Joe if uh if they really were to sit down and analyze 30 people on a bus and here's one guy that's just as calm as he could be maybe reading his Bible maybe let what you know maybe had your iPad maybe you had your iPhone maybe you had something you listen to a sermon and everybody else around him is cursing throwing stuff and pitching a fit and I know the truck drivers work brother Jones they're pretty rough people you know it's that's a tough job I I haven't been around him a lot but but you're sitting there in in the newscasters going well there's 35 people that's pitching the fan pulling their hair out but there's one guy sitting here we don't know what this guy's doing he may be a maniac he may be fixing to do something but he's sitting here different well see that's the world that's the testimony to the world maybe somebody that Bob never knew though was sitting in the back of that bus and was inspired right inspired by what he was doing or not doing same way with brother Joe you know truck driver usually gets out kicking tires gussing and everything else and there's brother Joe saying oh well it's okay everything will be all right see maybe they inspired something same way with you and I that's what I keep telling you people are watching you whether you know they're watching you or not that's right and can our actions convict this as a Christian do we have enough evidence right to convict this as a Christian because remember the people in Antioch acted like Christ so they begin to call them Christians that's where the Christian word came from was they became to act like Christ so they called them Christians in Antioch and Antioch was a very powerful church he had a huge amount of members 12. there are 12 people in that church but brother Brown said that was the most powerful Church in the first age so so it's not the it's not the quantity it's the quality of the quantity right that's why I said I'd rather have 20 that's got the new birth and they have 100 that didn't that's right because God can move through that twenty group of 20 people but let's start right here with patience everybody okay with Temperance Temperance is gonna we must not be off the temperance yet because I have to respect my boss again because he was trying to hold me till 4 30 and I was not happy so the school is calling me to try and come and get the kids and they took me two and a half hours and I was calling him the whole time but he was trying to hold me at the office so I need to really respect him again so you're praying for that okay I'm not quite okay we'll say that match but did you react like all the other employees react no actually attention but nice and I said you know what the school said this right we didn't get to get out and then after 2 30 and then I emailed him then I said you know you don't believe the school's calling me so it you know this is truly brother brother Keith Reed he hit the nail right on the head these are the trials of life these these versions show you through the trials of Life they'll show you no other way except through the trials of your individual life that's the only way brother Dale can preach patients for a hundred years and unless you get um unless you get an experience of patience just somebody speaking to somebody but you got experience I I I've been reading Oneness with God and it's a real good sermon and we're gonna we're gonna read some out of it this afternoon but brother Brown said it comes down to an individual Affair that's right you and God not you and the prophet and God not you in the pastor and God not you in the preacher and God it's you and not you and your husband and God or you and your wife and God or you and your kids and God he said it's you and God Alone that's it that's what it comes down to comes down now you've got to have a five-fold Ministry to get you to that spot right that's right you got to have a Godly husband and a Godly wife to get you to that spot but when it comes down to it God's Not Gonna Take me because Jim's Sanctified or filled with a Holy Ghost he's gonna take me because I am right and because she's got patience and I don't that don't mean I got patience uh let me put it this way we don't have virtues by association that's right you understand what I mean we don't have virtues by association that's right uh we have virtues by individuals brother Graham said it's an individual affair with God so it's an individual I can't tell you whether you got Temperance or not God's gonna show you if you if you get to a place to where you say God I don't know if I got whatever act knowledge temperance then he's obligated to put somebody there or put a situation in front of you to prove whether you've got patience or Temperance or whatever and you know what we're all at WIP which is a work in progress you know for all the work in progress that's right it's not we're not complete until that even after The Headstone comes headstone came to brother brown right he was sealed and capped off and adopted son of God and he still had problems he died in car wreck I mean he was he was fussing with his wife so it's what Sarah said he was fussing with his wife before they had to wreck so we're not immune to human nature I want us to see that but but we've got to see that if you've got Godly Temperance it'll show you somewhere if you've got Godly patience it'll show you somewhere not that you just got patience that's right you got to have Godly patients that's right God's Gonna what God's gonna have to do is he's going to connect it to the word or he's going to connect it to something in your life that's going to speak back to you that's what I want you to see in this whole thing I want God to speak back to you doesn't matter how much I understand here and I speak 15 or 20 many sermons on patience but until God shows you you got patience I can't show you you got patience now all I can do is is help you fight the devil when he comes and says you don't got patience I tell you this is what patience is and then you've got to connect to that same thing with a preacher upstairs a preacher can't give you a revelation only God can give you a revelation that's right now if the brother says something to Enlighten you or to take the scales off your eyes yes then that brother helped you but it was God that showed you something what it was is we we got the devil out of the way we don't get the devil out of the way and give you an Avenue so that you can talk to God all right because look at look at Paul Paul was smitting it on the road to Damascus right he had to find ananias somebody that already had the Holy Ghost now I don't know if Paul had natural scales on his eyes because the Bible says the scales came off his eyes but I just believe he came back to where he can under because seeing his understanding exactly you know seeing his understanding Paul knew there was an understanding number one that that must have been a deity must be in God because he called him Lord but that didn't save him uh it's one I want to do I learned a little bit about brother Dale talking about the seed well he Paul was the seed of God he should have been quickened right there because there was Jesus talking to him but he wasn't he had to go find somebody right God had to say go find this Prophet because remember let me tell you something else about ananias didn't want to go yeah that's right that's right that's right yeah now he was born again Christian right should have had these virtues working in his life a little brotherly kindness but he said are you sure that man Saul why because Saul had a reputation and he was having a nice gun you sure Lord are you sure you want me to go down there because remember he was putting him to death he was he was causing them to blaspheme he was actually persecuting the Christian people and here ananas has got to go and not just talk to him remember the Holy Ghost did you lay hands on him right oh my don't lay hands on a Jew basically Paul or salt but he had to go that seed had to be quickened by ananias because he had the word in him Paul didn't have the word in him Paul heard the word Paul knew the word but it wasn't quick unto it right so he had to receive the Holy Ghost and then the scales fell back well that's what's got to happen to you and I today in listening anywhere the scales have got to be pulled back just enough where you can see a little bit of God you know I'm gonna see the whole sermon see parts of it any sermon but the parts you need is when you go up there you say God give me my part for today okay give me my part for today and if it's the whole portion give it to me but he don't dump it all on you at one time you know better than that because we can't stand it but he'll let us know and we're not even going to get into patients but let's read the scripture and get when we can start on it all right second Peter 1 verse three according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertains unto life and godliness remember we started this before life that's what we just went through right here the life and godliness because we gotta act like God too through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are giving to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of a divine nature have an escape the corruption that is in world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge and all these Temperance Temperance patience and to patience godliness now the Greek Lexicon on patience I like this watch this right here this is what the Greek Mexican talks about watch steadfast look down at number one constancy endurance in the New Testament the characteristics of a man do you know the word patience is not in the Old Testament I looked it up this morning it's 33 times the word patience but it's all in the New Testament starting from Matthew to Revelation it is not in the Old Testament um now some of them did have patience but some of them didn't there's a lot of violence a lot of violence in the Old Testament so there was there was just a little bit of God's virtue that's why nobody was born again and I wish people could see that it's just kind of plain as a nose on your face that uh and we'll talk about it today because we're gonna we're gonna speak on the Journey of that Genesis 1 26 we're going to bring him out of Genesis and bring it right up today so he was in the Old Testament the Genesis one man you were you were there brother Brown tells you you were there with Moses you were there with this when you but you were there and the anointing that they had not as an indwelling not as the they couldn't be your brother because you you got the new birth and Moses Moses didn't have a new birth all right and New Testament characteristics of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and is loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials what we just talked about and sufferings a patient steadfast and right here's a good one right here waiting for now I like these last words enduring sustaining and perseverance that's what patience is you take patience you say well that's uh that's all but there's another word that comes out the first part of in Matthew it talks about having patience but not as being like a virtue so this is the this is the definition of it but it's almost the same bear long suffer long long you see what that says not just in a moment patience is a enduring a long journey patience is a journey patiently endured to be of long Spirit not to lose heart right to persevere patiently and bravely in enduring misfortunes and troubles well brother Joe and brother Bob went through Tuesday and on into Wednesday and Thursday probably for brother Joe to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others hmm to be mild and slow to punish now here in Luke it says and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but there shall not a hair of your head perish believe that why because in your patience possessing your soul in your patience Book of Luke in your in your patience possess you your soul Romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience he's not finished watch this right here and patience experience and experience hope so patience has a a few steps to it uh Temperance is being temperate but when you keep going up the statue of a perfect man it gets more narrow but what it does it compacts more and it shows that there's more to do it because tribulation work with patients there is no way you can show patients without having tribulation that's like brother Clark said the other day and he he looked up the definition of of happiness and on down further in in the word happiness it says sorrow is a part of happiness because you can't be happy if you hadn't been sorrowful or sorry if you hadn't went through tribulation brother Joe brother Bob today if you hadn't went through that tribulation you wouldn't have known you had that much patience okay but patience brings what experience and experience hope all right so now we know that one thing's for sure if it starts snowing in the middle of the week anymore that brother Joe and brother Bob is going to either try to hurry home or they're going to say well we got to do her this again that's right one of the two and I'm sure they're calling for snow Friday so they're going to probably pull the trigger real quick and nothing will happen maybe so but anyway that's just the world that we live in but we go through these things we go through these things we have to experience them watch this right here in Hebrews 6. and we'll finish right here and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end so patience is enduring to the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself now what about Abraham without the new birth saying surely blessing I will bless them multiplying I will multiply them so ask and so after that he had patiently endured he obtained the promise now Abraham didn't get the promise right off the bat right it looked worse as he got older but remember Abraham is the one that doesn't look at circumstances that's our problem we look at too many circumstances and I know we all get caught up in circumstances um but you know we we got to get out of that we're foreseen we also are compassionless what's this this is Hebrews 12 1. we're foreseen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience to race that is set before us let's continue let's get the scriptures and then we'll then we'll read what brother Brown says about it James 1. my brother encountered all joy when you fall into temptation count it what huh Joy Joy yes that was the last thing in bottom of mine Tuesday right that's right that's the last thing in his mind was Joy but today he and brother Bob and he and brother uh Joe were joyful amen right amen that made it through counted on Joy when you fall into diver's Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing wanting nothing James five and seven be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husband and waiteth that's patience for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it God's been waiting for six thousand years to come to this day right here all right what kind of patience is that until he received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord drawth not Grudge not one against another brethren unless you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren to prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy next Sunday we'll start on what brother Brown talks about the Statue of perfect man so Lord bless you take these scriptures and apply them to your life is my prayer
