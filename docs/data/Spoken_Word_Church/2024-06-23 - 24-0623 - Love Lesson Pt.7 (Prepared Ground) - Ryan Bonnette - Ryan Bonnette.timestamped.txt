[0:06] also pray for me teaching Sunday school
[0:08] here again this morning filling in for
[0:10] brother
[0:17] Bob so uh we've been on this series on
[0:20] love lessons I call them love lessons um
[0:23] and this one here is titled prepare your
[0:26] ground and last time I was talking on
[0:29] passion and and just making sure that we
[0:31] put that passion in our love not just be
[0:33] coming to church and serving the lord
[0:35] just you know just to be doing it but
[0:36] really be passionate about what we do
[0:38] and and in our our marriage as well um
[0:41] all of our love relationships you can
[0:42] put the passion in there um because it
[0:45] really makes it uh you know more
[0:47] meaningful if you're passionate about
[0:49] everything you do and really put your
[0:51] heart into it but on this lesson we're
[0:53] going to talk about preparing your
[0:54] ground I kind of keep going back to the
[0:57] foundation of our Christian Journey
[0:59] going back to the start back to the
[1:00] beginning laying that good foundation of
[1:03] faith and love falling in love with the
[1:05] Lord and that makes a big difference on
[1:07] how you grow and mature as a Christian
[1:10] so uh that's why I keep seeming to to
[1:12] pull back towards that for some reason I
[1:14] just can't seem to get off that I want
[1:15] to really make sure we're laying a good
[1:17] foundation and not neglecting that first
[1:19] love that we have for the Lord and uh
[1:22] preparing our ground to receive from him
[1:25] so let's go to the Lord in prayer about
[1:26] this lesson this morning Heavenly Father
[1:28] pray you bless this lesson and let it be
[1:30] a blessing and encouragement to your
[1:31] children Lord pray pray you just give me
[1:33] the words to speak and and say what
[1:35] would be true and right and and pleasing
[1:36] to you and be a help to them in Jesus
[1:39] name
[1:40] amen so we're looking at this scripture
[1:43] here in Mark 4 which is also found
[1:46] Matthew 13 and Luke 8 but I pick this
[1:49] one to read from um Mark 4:1 and he
[1:54] began again to teach by the seaside and
[1:56] there was gathered unto him a great
[1:58] multitude so so that he entered into a
[2:00] ship and sat in the sea and the whole
[2:03] multitude was by the Sea on the land so
[2:06] the setting is he's going to be in that
[2:08] ship there in that preaching to the
[2:09] people on the land and he taught them
[2:12] many things by Parables and said unto
[2:14] them in his Doctrine hearken behold
[2:17] there went out a sewer to sew and it
[2:19] came to pass as he sowed some fell by
[2:21] the wayside and the fouls of the air
[2:23] came and devoured it up and some fell on
[2:25] Stony ground where it had not much Earth
[2:27] and immediately it sprang up because it
[2:29] had no death of
[2:33] Earth but when the sun was up it was
[2:36] scorched and because it had no root it
[2:38] withered away and some fell among thorns
[2:41] and the Thorns grew up and choked it and
[2:43] it yielded no fruit and the other fell
[2:45] on good ground and did yield fruit and
[2:47] sprang up and increased and brought
[2:48] forth some 30 some 60 and some 100 and
[2:51] he said unto them he that hath ears to
[2:53] hear Let Him hear so there's a great
[2:56] key in this
[2:58] parable he said unto them know ye not
[3:01] this Parable how then will you know all
[3:03] Parables so there's something about this
[3:06] Parable that if you understand it it'll
[3:08] open a lot of things to you the sewer
[3:12] Seth the word now he's talking to his
[3:13] disciples I skipped one little section
[3:15] there but in this he's talking more
[3:17] intimately just to just his
[3:20] disciples the swer Seth the word and
[3:23] these are they by the wayside where the
[3:25] word is sown but when they have heard
[3:28] Satan cometh and immediately taketh away
[3:30] the word that was sown in their
[3:33] hearts and the so there's four groups
[3:35] bear that in mind which one of these
[3:37] four are you there's four groups
[3:40] here these are they likewise which are
[3:42] swn on Stony ground who when they have
[3:44] heard the word immediately receive it
[3:46] with gladness and have no root in
[3:49] themselves and so endure but for a Time
[3:52] afterward when Affliction or persecution
[3:53] arises for the word's sake immediately
[3:56] they are
[3:57] offended the devil despised es you if
[4:00] you take on the word of God he hates
[4:02] your guts all of hell is against this
[4:06] Revelation he is timately opposed to you
[4:09] if you take on the word of God know that
[4:11] he's going to be against you and that
[4:12] afflictions and trials are going to come
[4:14] he is a raging
[4:16] Lon and you'll find as you meditate on
[4:20] these little trials and think about the
[4:22] things that have happened it's no
[4:24] coincidence that you find them reflected
[4:26] in the Bible cuz that same Living Word
[4:28] that was alive in those BBL days still
[4:30] alive today but in you and so it will
[4:33] produce those same trials in you and
[4:35] you'll find yourself in a mark for trial
[4:37] where the disciples were in uh in that
[4:40] ship at the I think towards the end of
[4:42] Mark for and they were being tossed
[4:45] about by the ways and Jesus was asleep
[4:46] on the back of the ship Gabby and I
[4:48] walked through that trial when IA was
[4:49] born I fulfilled that what the disciples
[4:52] did I did I walked out of the hospital
[4:54] that day Saturday night going to the
[4:55] Bible study with Gabby and as I walked
[4:58] out the door there was a young lady
[4:59] carrying home her newborn baby born at
[5:01] the same time as IA this healthy baby
[5:03] going home and she might not even be a
[5:05] Christian here I am serving the lord
[5:06] going to church to a Bible study my
[5:09] baby's dying in the basement may not
[5:11] even be alive when I get back and I said
[5:13] Lord where are you I looked up and I
[5:15] remember saying Lord where are you at
[5:17] she's dying and here you are and we're
[5:19] going to serve you no matter what Lord
[5:21] we're not stopping we're not going to
[5:22] quit serving you you come what may but
[5:25] there's my baby dying in the hospital
[5:27] and I was so foolish asked that question
[5:30] cuz he was there but he was asleep on
[5:31] the ship so he was there and he was
[5:34] working the entire time but I fulfilled
[5:36] what the disciples did they said Lord
[5:38] carest thou not that we perish I said
[5:40] Lord carest thou not my baby's dying so
[5:43] you find yourself walking right in the
[5:44] midst of these trials just because of
[5:45] the sake of the word so you take on the
[5:47] word it's going to come there's trials
[5:49] going to come will you endure he that
[5:51] endures to then be saved Bible
[5:54] says and then here's I think this is the
[5:57] third group these are they which are
[5:59] shwn among Thorns such as hear the word
[6:01] and the cares of this world and the
[6:03] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[6:05] other things entering in choke the word
[6:07] and it becometh unfruitful so you're
[6:09] juggling all these things in life and we
[6:11] all are busy we all have things to
[6:14] juggle and maybe getting sidetracked
[6:16] with trying to accumulate wealth and
[6:19] accumulate things stuff that you won't
[6:21] take with you so it doesn't really
[6:22] amount to a whole lot but we get so busy
[6:26] and so distracted with all those things
[6:29] don't for forget the word of God don't
[6:30] forget to set aside that time of quiet
[6:32] and peace and and just with you and the
[6:34] Lord meditate on the word of God don't
[6:35] be choked don't let the word of God
[6:37] choke away all the I mean those things
[6:39] choke away the word of God from
[6:42] you just a little side note on that from
[6:44] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[6:46] brother Bon said why do you hunger
[6:47] Church why do you thirst it's the father
[6:49] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[6:51] you but you let so many things get it
[6:53] out of you you let your job your wife
[6:55] your husband you let your children the
[6:58] cares of this world you let some Pastor
[6:59] you let somebody else get that out of
[7:01] you when you know that way down in your
[7:03] heart you're thirsty and hungry is God
[7:06] trying to reveal it to you see the
[7:08] Revelation the last days here notice so
[7:11] God's trying and he's willing but he's
[7:14] just wanting us to just be still and
[7:15] listen and wait and be patient these are
[7:19] this is the force group now this is the
[7:21] group we want to be these are they which
[7:24] are sown on good ground such as hear the
[7:27] word and receive it and bring forth
[7:29] fruit root some 30 fold some 60 and some
[7:32] 100 I'm going to go ahead and get to
[7:34] that key what I believe and this there's
[7:36] there's one of the other uh accounts in
[7:39] one of the other gospels I think it's in
[7:40] Matthew where he points to this being
[7:43] understanding you hear the word and
[7:44] receive it and understand it well you
[7:46] might say well Ryan I don't understand I
[7:49] give
[7:50] up think about other natural things in
[7:53] life if you don't understand anything
[7:55] math well you need to read the math book
[7:56] don't you you got to study a little bit
[7:59] pass math class you don't understand any
[8:01] subject in school well you might need to
[8:03] get a tutor it's not just going to come
[8:05] automatically and why would the word of
[8:06] God be any different if you don't
[8:08] understand Daniel 70 weeks how have you
[8:10] read the book or if you've already read
[8:12] it well why not just keep on reading it
[8:13] till you understand um I don't
[8:17] understand a whole lot as much as I'd
[8:18] like to about the seals so Gavin and I
[8:20] every day we're still listening to the
[8:21] seals brother uh Brother D preached in
[8:23] 1982 and ' 83 we listen every day and
[8:26] talk about what he said every segment of
[8:28] that sermon we those sermons we go back
[8:30] and we we talk about it we're trying and
[8:32] praying for understanding anything you
[8:34] don't understand any of these mysteries
[8:36] of God that have been made real in our
[8:37] day and revealed if you don't understand
[8:39] them they're there they're open they're
[8:41] ready you just got to make yourself
[8:43] available make an effort you know study
[8:45] and pray the thing you don't understand
[8:47] get on your knees and say God help me
[8:49] understand that it's not just going to
[8:50] fall into you just just cuz you're alive
[8:52] in this age you know it's not by just
[8:54] default just cuz you're here so there's
[8:57] a key there hearing and receiving the
[9:00] word of God and planting it down in good
[9:02] ground so the son of man here I I did my
[9:05] best to get some pictures recent photos
[9:07] of our ministers they're they're in
[9:09] there somewhere and all that collage of
[9:11] photos you can find our ministers and
[9:13] some other ministers there the point is
[9:15] the son of man today is sewing the seed
[9:17] through our ministers through our
[9:18] five-fold ministry he's here sewing the
[9:21] word of God down but are we bringing the
[9:23] right kind of ground to receive it
[9:25] that's my whole point of this lesson
[9:27] prepare your ground to receive the word
[9:29] of God God what kind of ground are you
[9:31] there's good soul and there's bad Soul
[9:32] are you that real good moist uh
[9:35] nutrition uh Soul full of nutrients and
[9:37] things or are you that dry hard Stony
[9:40] soil where the where the word can't
[9:42] really get sewn down and get rooted
[9:44] good so how do you make your ground good
[9:48] to receive the seed word of God it's a
[9:51] question we're thinking about for a
[9:53] while how do you make your ground good
[9:54] to receive the word of
[9:56] God think about it just meditate for a
[9:59] moment on that form good habits of
[10:01] reading the Bible and praying and
[10:02] meditating on the word of God uh it's
[10:05] one thing I believe in in life is
[10:06] forming good habits you know and with so
[10:08] many things I could go into that for a
[10:10] while but just just suffice it to say
[10:12] forming good habits every day of keeping
[10:15] the word of God open before you um
[10:18] having all these channels open between
[10:19] you and the Lord any anything and
[10:21] everything you can do to make yourself
[10:22] available to God that's preparing your
[10:24] ground that's making yourself available
[10:27] making that ground good give uh time
[10:30] give God time to reveal it because that
[10:32] takes time uh you might study and pray
[10:34] on something for a while but then just
[10:37] let let it sit for a while you know you
[10:39] you sewn down the word of God of that
[10:41] thing whatever that subject is you're
[10:43] that mystery you're trying to understand
[10:44] you just wait a little while let God put
[10:46] a man in the pull pit to open it to you
[10:48] or or bring it in his time um don't
[10:51] neglect your daily bread the word of God
[10:53] again as I said baby steps I wrote down
[10:56] here baby steps everything God does is a
[10:58] slow process it's not uh nothing no
[11:01] quick get rich quick scheme here this is
[11:03] a slow process like brother Wade says a
[11:06] Crockpot not a not a microwave religion
[11:10] we believe in crockpot slow
[11:13] cooker H this is quite a few slides on
[11:16] this uh quote I guess I might just read
[11:18] the highlighted portion for the sake of
[11:19] time but works is Faith expressed
[11:21] brother vom said it's got to be revealed
[11:23] to you then you see who Jesus Christ is
[11:27] now here predestinated plan is in view
[11:29] Plain View just as other seed the word
[11:32] of God is a seed and must have the
[11:34] ground prepared
[11:36] beforehand if you sew seed if you sewed
[11:39] it just throw it out there on the ground
[11:41] it would not do it would do no good the
[11:43] birds would pick it up you throw it
[11:45] among thistles and Thorns it'll choke it
[11:46] out pretty soon Jesus parable said so so
[11:50] the ground has to be made ready first so
[11:52] God in soling Grace prepares the heart
[11:54] first he prepared you before the
[11:55] foundation of the world to receive him
[11:56] in this age he fornew you by his for
[12:00] knowledge and ordained you to eternal
[12:02] life M say all he's Justified he's
[12:04] already
[12:05] glorified so he knew you therefore he
[12:08] prepared you that's the reason you
[12:10] staggered out of these things and what
[12:12] you have now is God leading you to a
[12:14] place where he's ordained you to be it's
[12:15] the ground it if the ground isn't
[12:17] prepared before it it can't grow that's
[12:19] the reason the seed of faith when you're
[12:20] preaching Faith see the discernment of
[12:22] the Lord see what takes place all the
[12:24] gifts of the Bible working people work
[12:26] themselves up I think in one place
[12:28] brother banon said in these in a typical
[12:29] service you can ba basically see all
[12:31] four of these groups kind of uh
[12:34] manifesting um different people
[12:36] interacting different ways with the word
[12:39] of God as it comes forth and all of them
[12:41] taking it in different ways based on
[12:44] their ground really that's prepared
[12:46] whether their ground is prepared or
[12:48] not um like my little Eagle last night
[12:51] he knew when he heard the the scream of
[12:53] that mother Eagle there's not a lot of
[12:55] difference between that and the cluck of
[12:56] the hen because see he was there's a l
[12:59] lot of difference between that because
[13:00] he was an eagle from the egg he wasn't
[13:03] made an eagle right then he's always was
[13:05] an eagle and as a a Christian always was
[13:08] that's the reason divorce when you
[13:10] divorced because you were trapped into
[13:12] it your first parents Adam and Eve you
[13:14] became a sinner by
[13:16] Nature you didn't want to be but now you
[13:19] heard the gospel and faith comes by
[13:20] hearing Revelation comes by hearing this
[13:22] little something inside of you another
[13:23] man sitting right beside you say I don't
[13:25] believe that stuff is nonsense I don't
[13:27] believe that nothing nothing to
[13:30] that like they did on the day of
[13:32] Pentecost see here's those different
[13:33] groups right there on the day of
[13:35] Pentecost different reactions to the
[13:36] same word that was being preached the
[13:39] same event taking
[13:41] place these they said these men are full
[13:43] of new wine they know it was it was a
[13:45] great thing to those it was happening to
[13:47] why it was God revealing himself to the
[13:49] individuals not groups individuals While
[13:53] others laughed these were rejoicing it
[13:54] was an individual Revelation which is
[13:56] faith faith that's revealed if it wasn't
[13:58] revealed if it wasn't Faith they
[14:00] wouldn't even be there it was
[14:03] Faith just seeds has has to have the
[14:07] ground prepared first that's our key
[14:09] here what we're talking about
[14:11] today therefore all he forew he called
[14:14] and all he uh called he he predestinated
[14:17] if you was if you want to read that
[14:19] Romans 8 also Ephesians 1 skip on down
[14:21] to that other highlight part we see the
[14:23] message is rejected today isn't it isn't
[14:27] that just what the scriptures said they
[14:28] would do sure all these things ordained
[14:30] of
[14:32] God it should make you walk happy that's
[14:34] the trouble with us
[14:36] today so much difference with the old
[14:38] Christians to the new you know brother
[14:40] Aaron uh the other Wednesday night he
[14:42] was preaching on the divine order he was
[14:43] talking about once you get into that
[14:45] divine order of God there's really no
[14:47] more worry you're walking day by day
[14:49] Faith to Faith Revelation to Revelation
[14:52] even from the very beginning as a very
[14:53] young Christian if you just keep walking
[14:55] in that and don't stop every time I see
[14:57] a new Christian coming into the fold
[14:59] sometimes at work I'll see somebody and
[15:01] they'll tell me they gave their heart to
[15:02] the Lord I said awesome now don't stop
[15:05] just don't stop that's all I'm saying
[15:07] God will bring you where you need to be
[15:09] I don't sit there and tell them about
[15:10] revelation of Seven Seals and seven
[15:12] Thunders and deep things I just say just
[15:15] keep going just don't stop cuz so many
[15:18] I've seen along my journey that just
[15:19] quit you go little ways and then you
[15:21] quit you know and just just don't stop
[15:23] keep coming to church keep reading the
[15:24] Bible keep praying
[15:29] so think about your life today um we're
[15:31] going to get on down to let's go ahead
[15:32] and read uh let's see next slide we'll
[15:35] get into the Book of Joshua here in a
[15:37] moment works his faith ispressed any
[15:39] seeds any seed has to have its ground of
[15:41] course therefore all he forew he's
[15:43] already knew what going to happen Jesus
[15:46] said again about the seeds some fell on
[15:48] rocks others on mixed ground when thorns
[15:51] and thistles and everything else it
[15:52] couldn't grow and others on good ground
[15:54] good ground good soil which had been
[15:57] prepared already prepared all the out
[15:59] here like a chicken looking trying to
[16:00] find it hits into this and then into
[16:03] that but after a while there comes a
[16:05] sudden scream from Heaven he recognizes
[16:06] it right quick that's the word of God he
[16:09] knows it because there's something in
[16:10] his heart been told him been revealed to
[16:13] him or about it now we're going to go to
[16:16] the Book of Joshua chapter
[16:18] 23 be therefore very courageous to keep
[16:22] and do and to do all that is written in
[16:24] the book of the law Moses that you turn
[16:26] not aside there from to the right hand
[16:28] or to the left
[16:30] so now as we're reading this think about
[16:32] your journey in life today think about
[16:34] all the things that try to deter you and
[16:36] try to distract you false Doctrine and
[16:38] and Temptation and trials and all these
[16:40] things that try to rob from you that
[16:42] seed of God that's trying to be planted
[16:44] in you that word of God is trying to
[16:45] come think about that we read this in
[16:48] Joshua that you come not among these
[16:51] nations these that remain among you
[16:53] neither make mention of the name of
[16:55] their gods say maybe false doctrines uh
[16:59] nor cause to swear by them neither serve
[17:01] them nor bow yourselves unto them but
[17:04] cleave unto the Lord your God as you
[17:06] have done un this day for the Lord hath
[17:08] driven out from before you great Nations
[17:11] and strong but as for you no man hath
[17:13] been able to stand before you until this
[17:15] day so there again get in the divine
[17:17] order keep following God he'll fight
[17:19] your battles for you just keep on
[17:21] going one man of you shall chase a
[17:24] thousand he'll do things that you could
[17:26] never possibly do on yourself for the
[17:29] Lord your God he it is that fighteth for
[17:31] you as he hath promised you take good
[17:33] heed therefore unto yourself that you
[17:35] love the Lord your God there again a key
[17:37] in all these lessons I'm talking about
[17:38] love lessons fall in love with the Lord
[17:40] first that is so key and else if you do
[17:44] anywise go back and cleave to the
[17:46] remnant of these nations even these that
[17:49] remain among you and so make marriages
[17:51] with them and go into them and they un
[17:53] you know for certainty that the Lord
[17:55] your God will no more drive out any of
[17:57] these nations from before you
[17:59] but they shall be snares and traps in
[18:00] you and scourges in your sides and
[18:01] thorns in your eyes until you perish
[18:03] from off this good land which the Lord
[18:05] God has given you think of the good land
[18:06] as being the New Birth the kingdom of
[18:08] God but for today's lesson you can also
[18:11] think about it as being your own good
[18:12] ground that you're preparing for the
[18:14] Lord and you want to fight off all these
[18:17] things that maybe try to uh stop you in
[18:20] your effort you know and making your
[18:22] ground
[18:23] good and our our Joshua today of course
[18:26] is the Holy Ghost so
[18:30] brother Wade was preaching here recently
[18:32] a couple Sundays ago I think about come
[18:33] out of her my people in the Book of
[18:35] Revelation so bear that in mind too as
[18:37] we come up on this verse
[18:39] here and behold this day I'm going the
[18:43] way of all the Earth and you know in
[18:46] your hearts and all your souls that not
[18:47] one thing have failed of all the good
[18:49] things which the Lord your God spake
[18:50] concerning you all are come to pass unto
[18:52] you not one thing I fail therefore uh
[18:55] thereof therefore it shall come to pass
[18:58] that as all good things are come upon
[18:59] you which the Lord your God promised you
[19:01] so shall the Lord bring upon you all the
[19:04] evil things until he destroy you from
[19:05] off this good land which Lord God has
[19:07] given you it really pays heed that we
[19:10] are is really important that we
[19:13] should come out of our own false
[19:15] doctrines our own ideas because it's so
[19:16] so rampant it's not just the Catholic
[19:18] Church we're worried about or
[19:19] denominational churches it's us and our
[19:22] own self even in the message when you
[19:24] have transgressed the Covenant of the
[19:26] Lord your God which he commanded you you
[19:29] and have gone and served other gods and
[19:31] bowed yourselves to them then shall the
[19:32] anger of the Lord be kindled against you
[19:34] and He Shall Perish quickly from off the
[19:36] land which the Lord God given unto you
[19:39] uh spoken word is Original
[19:42] Seed I'll just start from the top that's
[19:44] the exactly the way Christ has to get
[19:46] him a bride now he's found the so-called
[19:49] group pregnated he's going to seow his
[19:51] seed he's going to do it one way or
[19:54] another somebody's going to get it
[19:56] because they're predestinated to be the
[19:58] church at the end of the road there's
[19:59] going to be a group here no matter what
[20:02] we decide you say it depends on I found
[20:05] predestinate or not well predestination
[20:07] again looks back to God's forn knowledge
[20:09] of your choice so your choice
[20:12] today has has a lot to do with that then
[20:15] like Adam and Jehovah's who found them
[20:18] pregnated with man-made doctrines of
[20:20] denominations like God's truth in
[20:22] Genesis 1 every seed has brought forth
[20:26] after its kind so when the spirit fell
[20:27] on her man had been there to her womb
[20:30] and filled it with denominational seed
[20:31] of his own thinking that's why she got
[20:33] to be that way she is Christ couldn't
[20:35] come into
[20:36] her
[20:38] okay think about I believe this was
[20:40] Psalm in in proverbs 30 said I went by
[20:43] the field of the slothful and by the
[20:45] vineyard of the man void of
[20:47] understanding so again thinking about
[20:49] that good ground preparing ground to
[20:52] receive the word of God so he went by
[20:54] the field of the
[20:55] slothful if you're going to grow a
[20:57] natural crop you really can't be
[20:58] slothful you've got to work it you've
[21:00] got to plant it you've got to sew it
[21:02] you've got to water it and make sure it
[21:04] has the correct amount of light make
[21:05] sure it's in good soil has the nutrients
[21:07] and all that kind of thing it takes a
[21:09] lot of effort you know so you can't be
[21:12] slothful and do that so here's what
[21:14] happens as salon beheld and lo it was
[21:17] all grown over with thorns and Nettles
[21:20] had covered the face thereof and the
[21:21] stone wall thereof was broken
[21:23] down so all your Fortress is broken down
[21:26] all these false doctrines and things can
[21:28] come in and take that word of God that
[21:30] was sewn down then I saw and considered
[21:33] it well and I looked upon it and
[21:34] received instruction yet a little sleep
[21:36] a little Slumber a little folding of the
[21:38] hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come
[21:40] as one thata travelleth and thy want as
[21:43] an armed man so we have to be
[21:48] diligent so don't let our field our
[21:50] walls be broken down and just keep on
[21:54] serving the lord and seeking him be
[21:56] diligent about it it's in my desire that
[21:58] I should chastise them this is Hosea 10
[22:02] and the people shall be gathered against
[22:04] them and when they shall bind themselves
[22:06] in their two furrows and Ephraim was as
[22:08] an hepher that is taught and loveth To
[22:11] Tread out the corn but I passed over her
[22:13] Fair neck and I will make Ephraim to
[22:15] ride Judah shall plow and Jacob shall
[22:17] break his claws sow to yourselves in
[22:20] righteousness reap in Mercy break up
[22:22] your follow ground for it is time to
[22:24] seek the Lord maybe the ground's been
[22:26] left sitting for a while you know and
[22:27] you need to Stir It Up and get the
[22:29] nutrients and everything good and ready
[22:31] to receive seed for it's time to seek
[22:33] the Lord he's talking about preparing
[22:36] ground as in seeking the Lord here until
[22:38] he come and re righteousness upon you
[22:40] that's God's part he does that we just
[22:42] prepare the ground ye have plowed
[22:45] wickedness ye have reaped iniquity you
[22:47] have eaten the fruit of lies because
[22:49] thou D trust in thy way the multitude of
[22:51] thy mighty man there's not in anything
[22:54] that's that we good that we can do or
[22:55] any of our strength you know it's all in
[22:57] God but yet we have this part that we
[23:00] prepare our ground make oursel ready we
[23:01] do it every service we come here we
[23:04] should be coming ready and with our
[23:05] ground
[23:06] open um just closing up I guess last few
[23:09] more slides here running out of time so
[23:11] we all live in the sewing and reaping
[23:14] the whole universe is really based on
[23:15] cause and effect sewing and reaping you
[23:18] know when you reap what we what you
[23:21] sew we all know that we can look at
[23:23] examples in the Bible of Adam and Eve
[23:25] and in this case I'm referring to sewing
[23:27] as you know choices you make and you
[23:29] reap from your choices you know your
[23:32] choice of do you prepare your ground or
[23:33] not do you come with an open heart to
[23:35] receive the word of God or not Cain and
[23:37] abble is another good example making
[23:40] choices um this was actually taken from
[23:43] one of my uh later lessons I just wanted
[23:45] to apply this here benefits of reading
[23:47] the Bible every day first of all it
[23:51] brings you to the New Birth gives you
[23:52] Faith Revelation it takes away your
[23:54] unbelief teaches you to love God and
[23:57] others The Living Word word of God it
[23:59] lives in you and through you as I gave
[24:01] that earlier example it actually is a
[24:03] Living Word and as you take it on you'll
[24:05] see it live through you um even through
[24:08] those trials that come gives you joy
[24:11] peace contentment it helps you in your
[24:12] marriage and other relationships gives
[24:14] you stability because there's not any
[24:16] anywhere else there's not any stability
[24:18] anywhere
[24:21] else
[24:23] so in 1 Peter 1 seeing you have purified
[24:26] your souls in obeying the truth through
[24:27] the spirit of unfa love of the Brethren
[24:29] see that you love one another with a
[24:31] pure heart fervently being born again
[24:33] not of corruptible seed but of
[24:34] Incorruptible seed by the word of God
[24:35] that liveth and abideth forever you must
[24:38] read the
[24:41] Bible okay um let's see I guess a couple
[24:44] more slides here John
[24:45] 15 if you abide in me and my words abide
[24:48] in you at you shall ask what you will
[24:51] and it shall be done unto you here in is
[24:52] my father glorified that you bear much
[24:54] fruit so God's willing again for us to
[24:57] bear fruit and take on this seed and let
[24:59] him over time grow this fruit and we
[25:02] bear it unto God so shall you be my
[25:04] disciples as the father that loved me so
[25:06] have I loved you continue in my love if
[25:09] you keep my Commandments you shall abide
[25:11] in my love even as I have kept my
[25:12] father's Commandments and abide in his
[25:13] love these things have I spoken unto you
[25:15] that my joy might remain in you and that
[25:17] your joy might be
[25:19] full James 1 if any of you like wisdom
[25:22] let him ask of God here we are again
[25:23] with well saying I don't have
[25:25] understanding about certain Mysteries uh
[25:27] the musicians y'all go make your way up
[25:29] here uh I don't understand the mysteries
[25:31] of God
[25:32] well ask
[25:35] God that giveth all men liberally and
[25:37] abrath not and it shall be given him but
[25:40] let him ask in faith nothing wavering
[25:42] for he that wavereth is like a wave of
[25:44] the sea driven with the wind and tossed
[25:46] for let not that man think that he shall
[25:48] receive anything of the Lord a
[25:49] double-minded man is unstable there
[25:51] again I'm talking about stability um is
[25:54] unstable in all its ways so ask God for
[25:56] wisdom and understanding revelation of
[25:58] the word as you read it be absolute he
[26:00] absolutely will help you understand if
[26:03] you make an effort reading his word will
[26:05] give you stability both spiritually and
[26:06] in your life choices let's go and close
[26:09] that off there I'll save the rest of
[26:10] them for next time thank you God bless
[26:13] you amen
[26:17] [Applause]
[26:25] [Music]
