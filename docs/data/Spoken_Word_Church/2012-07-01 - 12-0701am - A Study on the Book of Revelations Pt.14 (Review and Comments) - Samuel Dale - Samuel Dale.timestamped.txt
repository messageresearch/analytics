[48:10] you know not give out notes or even just
[48:13] comments that come down looking across
[48:16] what I've got here and try to tie it all
[48:18] together because it's a foundation for
[48:21] understanding the the fifth chapter of
[48:24] the Book of Revelation amen so just
[48:26] remember that
[48:29] our precious Lord and our savior Our
[48:31] Redeemer our all in all and Jesus Lord
[48:35] is your name thank you for revealing
[48:37] that name unto us and telling us that we
[48:40] can ask anything in your name
[48:42] so we asked this day that you would come
[48:44] Among Us first to Lord be here and to
[48:48] speak to each heart as we open our eyes
[48:51] of our understanding unto you and let
[48:54] you speak to our hearts and lives you
[48:56] come and have your way with us Lord
[48:57] remember the sick ones Among Us just
[49:00] touch each one remember our wife Lord
[49:02] going tomorrow there to the doctor for
[49:04] more tests and just Lord let everything
[49:07] work out take away the pain because
[49:09] that's the hurting part that we're
[49:11] against and Lord just remember each one
[49:13] remember the last father and just bless
[49:15] him take away that temperature be with
[49:18] brother Dean's brother that Clinton and
[49:21] just touch him Lord and let everything
[49:22] be all right remember all the other
[49:24] sicknesses among us because we believe
[49:27] you and we thank you have your way now
[49:29] come and speak to our hearts in Jesus
[49:31] name amen
[49:34] we're going to Revelation 1 where we've
[49:36] been reading
[49:37] verse one through three
[49:43] it says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:45] which God gave unto him
[49:48] to show unto his servants things which
[49:51] must shortly come to pass
[49:53] and he said and signified it by his
[49:55] Angel into his servant John
[49:57] who by record of the word of God and of
[49:59] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[50:02] things that he saw blessed is he that
[50:04] readeth and they that hear the words of
[50:06] this prophecy
[50:08] and keep those things which are written
[50:09] therein for the time is at hand it may
[50:13] be seated before that is blessing to the
[50:16] reading of the word
[50:18] no
[50:23] I worked as I said I wanted this time
[50:26] review what we've been talking about and
[50:29] then maybe make just a few comments and
[50:31] and you know and getting ready for
[50:34] starting the fifth chapter I thought you
[50:38] know on that that I would just really
[50:40] start preaching on the fifth chapter but
[50:42] then I seen that that we needed a
[50:45] background a study and an understanding
[50:48] you know to help us to get up to the
[50:50] place and and see then it would save a
[50:53] lot of trouble when we get there to just
[50:55] be able to
[50:56] to do a lot of comments and things and
[51:00] um so we'll try to start this afternoon
[51:02] on the fifth chapter of Revelation all
[51:06] right
[51:07] now
[51:09] I've had to bypass a lot of things I
[51:12] know in this even just in what we've
[51:15] been covering but I believe that we've
[51:18] gotten you know the point
[51:20] of what I've been trying to drive at
[51:23] right as you know uh to me the Book of
[51:27] Revelation that I keep saying is the
[51:30] bride's book it's a book about the Bride
[51:32] of Jesus Christ it shows you and I you
[51:35] want to read about us read the book of
[51:36] Revelation because it's bringing it down
[51:39] personally you know personal to where
[51:42] we're living
[51:43] our day and our age is shown in the Book
[51:46] of Revelation and see then that way we
[51:48] can can read it and see ourselves and
[51:51] what has been our point that in the Book
[51:54] of Revelation that you don't find Jesus
[51:56] by himself you find him showing himself
[51:59] in in with the bride in the bride and
[52:04] you know showing it uh showing the bride
[52:06] all right and that way then you can look
[52:09] at it and and see ourselves
[52:13] so then uh
[52:15] watch what we're trying to do we started
[52:18] out so let's just start from where we
[52:20] kind of begin on the series and we
[52:22] didn't spend much time in chapter one
[52:25] but we started out in chapter one and we
[52:28] we read our word that this is the
[52:30] Revelation that God gave to Jesus to
[52:33] give to John to to bring the word down
[52:35] to you and I except signified it by his
[52:38] Angel and and you know blessed are they
[52:41] that read this book or even hear well
[52:44] it's a blessing one because it's it's
[52:46] written to you and I to us a wonderful
[52:49] wonderful situation it's it's our book
[52:51] but it's a word of Prophecy remember
[52:54] what we covered that prophecy is divine
[52:57] inspiration from God
[53:00] in other words they're setting in order
[53:01] of scriptures so then really The Book of
[53:05] Revelation is a setting in order of all
[53:09] of the previous scriptures right all
[53:12] right now that was my point Darcy The
[53:14] Book of Revelations if you want to say
[53:16] in order so you go to the book that
[53:18] everybody sets their way from yeah and
[53:20] even in the message people we can't
[53:23] understand even after the prophet has
[53:24] brought these times you know they seem
[53:27] to shy away from The Book of Revelations
[53:29] but to me it would be the the book of
[53:33] Prophecy to cover together you know not
[53:36] prophesy prophecy
[53:39] c-y-p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y meaning the setting
[53:41] in order all right so all of the Bible
[53:44] is set in order by The Book of
[53:45] Revelation
[53:47] hey that was the point I tried to get
[53:49] you to realize that we can read the
[53:51] other gospels and we say well this is
[53:54] God's word well what do you think the
[53:56] Book of Revelation did right amen I mean
[53:58] is it just you know you know how I told
[54:02] you what I believe we have in uh you
[54:05] know I use it a lot because it's true
[54:06] but you have what you call a red letter
[54:09] edition of your Bible which means that
[54:11] everything Jesus says is put in red
[54:15] letter you know for to help you well I
[54:17] believe the whole Bible ought to be put
[54:18] in red light I think it ought to be read
[54:21] from the beginning of Genesis to the
[54:23] finishing of Revelation because you know
[54:25] of what it's doing all right
[54:28] but now
[54:30] we we've covered these things in trying
[54:34] to to understand so then we went through
[54:37] as I said the first chapter and covering
[54:40] then the uh the one standing Revelation
[54:42] 1 13 one standing in the midst of the
[54:44] seven golden candlesticks like under the
[54:47] son of man gird about the pouch with the
[54:49] golden girdle you know and all of that
[54:51] was showing God in Bride forms
[54:55] believe God is women how feminist see
[54:58] it's it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:01] says one life unto the son of man it
[55:04] didn't say these on a man because it
[55:06] wasn't like unto the son of man right
[55:07] well if it's one life unto the son of
[55:09] man it would be the son of man in
[55:11] another form right right all right and
[55:14] that son of man in another form is his
[55:16] bride all right so we started all seeing
[55:19] ourselves and I told you I said even
[55:21] before John went into writing about the
[55:24] church ages and the thing he told the
[55:26] bride how beautiful she was right how
[55:28] wonderful she she was set forth in the
[55:31] word to to uh you know understand who we
[55:34] are
[55:35] it was our book right well then we kind
[55:38] of baptized the church ages because you
[55:40] know they're more or less of a
[55:42] self-explanatory of reading when and the
[55:45] prophet read what he says on those
[55:47] things and and you know then it would
[55:51] cover down but then we got up to
[55:54] when we started there we found out John
[55:57] said in chapter 1 that he was in the
[55:59] spirit
[56:00] right me
[56:02] he was in the spirit
[56:06] well now
[56:07] if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[56:10] you can't get in the spirit right right
[56:13] amen now that sensible or playing amen
[56:17] and if you talk about a eagle
[56:20] well if you're not an eagle then you
[56:22] can't understand equal language amen you
[56:26] can't eat Eagle food
[56:28] me
[56:30] and all that it'll make you sick right
[56:32] but see then you know you don't want to
[56:35] go that way so John repeats then in
[56:38] chapter four that it's in the spirit
[56:40] emphasizing what if we don't get into
[56:44] the Holy Spirit we can't understand the
[56:47] word of God I don't care what we do how
[56:49] much we read or how much we can quote if
[56:52] it's not revealed to us by the Holy
[56:54] Spirit and made manifest by the Holy
[56:57] Spirit what good is it right amen
[56:59] it's only letters on the page
[57:02] so you can say well I I've got it here I
[57:04] can argue with anybody now about it well
[57:06] that's about all you're going to do then
[57:08] right if that's your point
[57:11] I was sitting listening to a person uh
[57:15] you know testifying preaching uh one
[57:18] time I won't say when but
[57:21] um
[57:21] uh you know I mean it just really got
[57:24] into it about the Holy Spirit and things
[57:26] and
[57:27] the first thought I was I thought well
[57:29] boy he's sure taking a lot of time you
[57:31] know
[57:31] he's cutting into my time you know
[57:33] getting to work he's taking the
[57:36] preaching a while but you know what I
[57:39] sat there and thought a minute
[57:43] and I thought Lord that's all that
[57:45] person's got there
[57:47] that's right
[57:49] that's the only guy
[57:54] you know
[57:56] you know the Baptist that's all they've
[57:58] got
[57:59] is what little bit of God they know
[58:03] to imagine this Presbyterian Pentecostal
[58:05] whatever
[58:07] it's what little bit they know is all
[58:09] they've done
[58:10] well I wouldn't want to take that away
[58:14] if you think I try to destroy people in
[58:16] their beliefs you you've really
[58:19] misunderstood me right
[58:21] because I never wanted to destroy
[58:23] anybody's belief
[58:26] if the Holy Spirit can't destroy your
[58:28] belief then what good am I right
[58:31] you know if he can't change you what can
[58:33] I do and that's why that you see very
[58:36] few people are one to the true message
[58:40] is because most people are trying to
[58:43] beat people with the message instead of
[58:45] preaching the message that's right you
[58:48] know trying to force you to believe in
[58:50] one God trying to force you to believe
[58:51] in a prophet okay try to force you to
[58:53] believe in all kind of things instead of
[58:55] allowing the Holy Spirit to do it right
[58:57] amen and I wouldn't I wouldn't go to a
[59:00] Baptist church today
[59:02] and stand up there and say you're all
[59:04] wrong you're false no I do the best I
[59:07] could to try to preach Jesus Christ amen
[59:10] in the realm they were in
[59:14] and see when I go about preaching in the
[59:16] message a long time which bird a little
[59:18] but I I try to preach in the realm of
[59:20] the people right that's there right amen
[59:23] I don't go preach to see youth marriage
[59:25] and divorce you know all of these things
[59:27] like that out somewhere else
[59:30] I come here and do it right now if I'm
[59:33] invited to do it I would be glad to go
[59:35] and do it you know I mean that but
[59:37] that's fine but get the point see and
[59:39] I'm sitting there and I really thought I
[59:41] don't want to destroy that person
[59:43] right if that's all they got
[59:47] it's all it's all that you've got is one
[59:50] God
[59:51] Heaven helped me to try to destroy it
[59:53] right help me to try to build it up you
[59:57] know clear it up give a better
[1:00:00] understanding
[1:00:01] help you to to get more information
[1:00:05] you know more things we me and this man
[1:00:07] were talking one diamond and I mean he
[1:00:10] was really contrary to me and he was
[1:00:13] just this is a long time ago
[1:00:15] and he was trying to think of something
[1:00:17] I said I'll just quote the quote for you
[1:00:19] I don't agree with you and don't agree
[1:00:21] with what's the way you're going to use
[1:00:22] the quote but I said here's the quote
[1:00:24] and I run it you know I run it all for
[1:00:26] it go you know I mean I I was trying to
[1:00:30] help a human being if he wanted to be
[1:00:32] blind let him be blind I can't change
[1:00:34] that but see
[1:00:37] I think that's the point that we would
[1:00:39] have is to try to get the message out
[1:00:42] amen the
[1:00:43] to help people understand right that's
[1:00:46] right not to try to tell them how bad
[1:00:48] they are
[1:00:49] right because when you do that that
[1:00:51] spirit is raising up in that person and
[1:00:54] they're not listening to you they're
[1:00:55] waiting on you as a prophet said to shut
[1:00:57] up where they can refute what you're
[1:00:59] saying they're sitting there running
[1:01:01] quotes in their mind you know and their
[1:01:03] their scriptures and stuff and it
[1:01:05] shouldn't be that way
[1:01:08] we should have the spirit of Christ
[1:01:11] he didn't write down on him until it
[1:01:14] come down to really hard right
[1:01:18] and really the people he didn't write
[1:01:20] down on very much you go by study your
[1:01:22] Bible it's always in religious Pharisees
[1:01:26] he didn't say to the people you're of
[1:01:28] your father the devil
[1:01:30] right he specifically put it in one
[1:01:32] point right
[1:01:34] but see just think about it so then
[1:01:36] let's just do what we can to help each
[1:01:37] other all right
[1:01:39] you know
[1:01:40] I mean if there's anywhere in the world
[1:01:41] I could help a uh the pope or wrong
[1:01:45] to understand his uh what he was even
[1:01:49] here for
[1:01:51] you know I would go talk to him and turn
[1:01:54] it
[1:01:55] he said yeah but he's here to take us
[1:01:56] down well I think that's what we need we
[1:02:00] need to be put down a whole lot where we
[1:02:01] can cut out all the garbage can and get
[1:02:04] on with the word of God find out whether
[1:02:06] it's real then they're hard or not
[1:02:08] that's right amen and just understanding
[1:02:12] it's not all that big
[1:02:15] it's just believing right that's right
[1:02:18] Danny come up here Wednesday when he
[1:02:20] walked away I grant
[1:02:22] I knew his headache was gone it might
[1:02:24] take him more I called him an insulator
[1:02:27] and he said I'm all right
[1:02:29] beside you right there that was gone
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:33] but see he had to get it from going
[1:02:36] right he couldn't get it for me
[1:02:38] I just knew it was gone right amen he
[1:02:41] can reveal things to you
[1:02:44] was he doing this go out and broadcast
[1:02:46] it no
[1:02:47] do the best you can
[1:02:50] to help people all right forgive me
[1:02:52] won't charge you on that part okay
[1:02:54] because that to me is giving in the
[1:02:56] spirit
[1:02:58] let's get into the Holy Spirit and and
[1:03:01] relax and and just let God speak to her
[1:03:04] hearts
[1:03:05] and you know I mean they used to say and
[1:03:07] I agree with them that's all right he
[1:03:09] used to say before you play a tape now
[1:03:10] said you're going to need to pray 30
[1:03:12] minutes well I that's a good point
[1:03:14] that's all right man I'm not against
[1:03:15] that but I didn't have the 30 minutes I
[1:03:18] only had 30 minutes
[1:03:20] yeah and that was to get me a tape
[1:03:23] listening to and riding down the highway
[1:03:24] or something so I surely couldn't start
[1:03:27] praying you know and and stopped in the
[1:03:29] middle Expressway and and all like that
[1:03:31] so you just say Lord help me get me out
[1:03:33] of the way where I can listen if I get a
[1:03:36] chance later I'll pray you know but
[1:03:38] that's you know people don't understand
[1:03:40] me like that I just I but I'm just
[1:03:42] trying to to help you and I get in the
[1:03:44] spirit of God right amen and if we're
[1:03:47] not born again we can't get in the
[1:03:48] spirit right if we're not an eagle we
[1:03:51] can't understand we run around we gave
[1:03:53] it to you at the end of the message
[1:03:55] every Wednesday brother and said a true
[1:03:56] Eagle we'll understand
[1:03:59] a true if it's a true Eagle right amen
[1:04:01] right if it's not there's no way you can
[1:04:04] convince anybody that's right
[1:04:07] you can't convince people about uh the
[1:04:10] power of quotes
[1:04:14] just preach the gospel and go on and let
[1:04:17] it be but let's get in the spirit of it
[1:04:18] all right
[1:04:20] now like I said you notice in
[1:04:22] Revelations 1 I think it's about verse
[1:04:25] 10. John was talking about getting in
[1:04:27] the spirit
[1:04:29] get in the spirit you know on the Lord's
[1:04:31] Day
[1:04:33] then he comes over to chapter four
[1:04:36] and he says he's getting in the spirit
[1:04:39] of the Lord
[1:04:40] and that Spirit of the Lord is
[1:04:44] you know the days of man is gone what is
[1:04:47] the the the the the Lord's day when the
[1:04:50] day it's not Sabbath it's not a date or
[1:04:52] a time John was only out of Patmos for
[1:04:54] two years I'm quoting brother random as
[1:04:57] I look down see
[1:04:58] for two years on the Isle of patents
[1:05:00] getting the Book of Revelation so it
[1:05:02] certainly wasn't one day it's when the
[1:05:05] days of man is over is the Lord's day
[1:05:07] amen all right see then when it's over
[1:05:10] with
[1:05:11] then we can can receive from God what we
[1:05:14] have need of and you know relax in that
[1:05:17] all right and what did we find that the
[1:05:20] Book of Revelations is
[1:05:22] coming on over into chapter four
[1:05:26] it's not only the uncovering of the
[1:05:30] person of Christ
[1:05:32] but it's the revelation of his future
[1:05:34] work in the oncoming seven Church ages
[1:05:38] The Book of Revelation is not a
[1:05:41] revealing of Christ it's revealing where
[1:05:43] Christ is
[1:05:46] he's in his bride that's that you know
[1:05:48] that's the Revelation that God give to
[1:05:49] Jesus to give to John said Jesus didn't
[1:05:52] know he's part in the Kingdom that's
[1:05:55] right until he comes to the part of that
[1:05:57] was then he could come to John to tell
[1:05:59] it right
[1:06:01] it all comes out the end that we we need
[1:06:04] to have the Book of Revelations open
[1:06:07] unto us and we found I preached one
[1:06:09] message in there that we found that it
[1:06:11] would take a special people amen that's
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:15] of special people to be able to
[1:06:17] understand it couldn't be revealed
[1:06:19] remember I gave even a quote it couldn't
[1:06:22] be revealed in the days of of the line
[1:06:25] the ox the man
[1:06:28] he couldn't be revealed until this day
[1:06:32] that's right that was my emphasis to try
[1:06:33] to get across this past Wednesday it
[1:06:36] couldn't be revealed until the Eagles
[1:06:38] come amen
[1:06:40] see everybody said the eagle period and
[1:06:42] I'm running around to the Eagles right
[1:06:44] amen
[1:06:47] special people
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] you know what types of special people to
[1:06:53] understand this message
[1:06:55] I said you got to be born again then you
[1:06:57] got to hear the message
[1:06:59] but then if the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:07:01] reveal that
[1:07:02] it is not put together by fifo Ministry
[1:07:05] where are we amen
[1:07:08] right now I didn't quote these things
[1:07:10] but around was when it said it I
[1:07:12] preached it to you over the series
[1:07:16] according to my Bible according to
[1:07:18] Prophet the bible ministries for the
[1:07:20] professional sign amen
[1:07:23] all right now you said well I should try
[1:07:26] and make something about yourself no I'm
[1:07:27] just being what I am
[1:07:29] I mean
[1:07:31] and I I couldn't help it that God made
[1:07:33] me this way
[1:07:35] he chose me I certainly didn't choose
[1:07:37] myself all right
[1:07:40] but see the key to understand anything
[1:07:44] is to first get in the spirit
[1:07:47] of what is being revealed all right
[1:07:50] right then put your mind into what is
[1:07:52] being made known right
[1:07:56] not just put it into the basis or I'll
[1:07:59] read this ask God to reveal it amen
[1:08:02] right amen
[1:08:04] you got a question about something you
[1:08:06] know I gave you one one question in
[1:08:08] there that they asked right around said
[1:08:09] you know what is the carcass and one of
[1:08:12] the Eagles
[1:08:13] well you know he explained it right
[1:08:15] the carcass being the word of God and
[1:08:17] the Eagles the one who could eat the
[1:08:19] food right
[1:08:22] that's the way I do I say well all right
[1:08:24] now Lord I want to speak on Revelations
[1:08:28] five now but I won't know what the
[1:08:30] prophet had to say yep
[1:08:33] I got one brother he said let me study
[1:08:36] these things out and said I'll come back
[1:08:38] by here and preach on this statue of
[1:08:40] perfect man one time here years ago
[1:08:42] and uh he said I don't want to listen to
[1:08:45] what y'all had to say when he came back
[1:08:47] maybe six months a year later
[1:08:49] and uh
[1:08:51] he would have been really good if he
[1:08:53] just listened to a few things that was
[1:08:55] said because he had the Rapture coming
[1:08:57] in the sixth Church age
[1:08:59] because the six churches brotherly
[1:09:01] kindness and he had a quote from Brother
[1:09:03] Randall Rapture comes into brotherly
[1:09:06] kindness age
[1:09:09] so then he was totally off so he wasted
[1:09:13] six months of studying
[1:09:15] if he just listened and got a lineup
[1:09:20] I mean
[1:09:21] then he would have seen what's going on
[1:09:23] all right that's right but just think
[1:09:26] about it now
[1:09:30] so then we realized it
[1:09:35] we see God in Bride form throughout the
[1:09:38] Book of Revelation
[1:09:42] where do we get to the land at the seven
[1:09:45] horns and seven eyes right the one that
[1:09:48] breaks the scene away amen
[1:09:51] right
[1:09:55] but we went through trying to find
[1:09:57] something and seeing that what that the
[1:10:00] bride went up in a Rapture in
[1:10:02] Revelations 4 1. John did as it taught
[1:10:04] the Rapture but one day we will be
[1:10:07] raptured up not as a type right and then
[1:10:09] we went into the symbols of the open
[1:10:11] door be in Jesus Christ then we went
[1:10:13] through the voices the same voice that
[1:10:16] John heard on Earth you know amen and
[1:10:19] that's what he was looking to see Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ but when he looked he saw a door
[1:10:22] because he's a prophet he's to receive
[1:10:25] symbols all right he hears your voice
[1:10:28] it's the same voice he heard on Earth he
[1:10:31] saw the throne
[1:10:34] and he saw one sitting on the throne
[1:10:37] we saw that was what
[1:10:41] that was not Jesus's Throne that's the
[1:10:44] Father Strong right and that's
[1:10:46] the baptism with the Holy Ghost right
[1:10:50] he is strong will be in the millennial
[1:10:51] reign
[1:10:54] I gave you these quotes
[1:10:56] he was not only as strong that Throne
[1:10:59] belongs to Spirit God Amen not human
[1:11:02] flesh but there was a human flesh
[1:11:03] sitting on the drum all right but he was
[1:11:07] a look upon and described him as to what
[1:11:09] Jasper and sardine stone
[1:11:12] one Reuben and Benjamin
[1:11:16] all right the Patriarchs then we went on
[1:11:19] down into the 24 elders and found out
[1:11:23] they were the 12 apostles and 12
[1:11:26] Prophets
[1:11:27] that would run around the throne we went
[1:11:30] through the rainbow
[1:11:33] that John Saul around about the throne
[1:11:37] all right but see if you go back and
[1:11:39] read Revelations one real careful you'll
[1:11:42] see that that was a rainbow that John
[1:11:44] was seeing in there in Revelations one
[1:11:46] like in the emerald like under things
[1:11:49] of course the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:11:53] it's not a another something that would
[1:11:55] be hard to understand
[1:11:58] we went around that the rainbow would be
[1:12:00] was around about the throne and that we
[1:12:03] in here in this life only get a half of
[1:12:04] a rainbow
[1:12:06] from one part of the earth down to the
[1:12:08] other but when we get dire signifying
[1:12:10] that there was more to be revealed
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:14] and when we get married to reveal the
[1:12:16] word to us down to the endless ages and
[1:12:19] it'd be a great time all right amen we
[1:12:22] went on over to talking about the
[1:12:25] the Judgment seat because of the
[1:12:27] Thunders and the Lightnings and things
[1:12:28] so that would take that part all the way
[1:12:31] and you go clean over to to
[1:12:34] about the 17th or 18th chapter somewhere
[1:12:37] about the the where the why throwing
[1:12:40] judgment is happy
[1:12:42] we found that we sit on the Judgment not
[1:12:45] before the Judgment all right amen all
[1:12:47] right thank you Lord that'll be a
[1:12:48] wonderful thing won't it amen to know
[1:12:51] that we missed the tribulation yeah
[1:12:54] do you think we went into the combat
[1:12:56] Beast
[1:12:59] Galatians 4 6-8
[1:13:02] and we saw that Ezekiel
[1:13:05] run around and said
[1:13:07] it's all that
[1:13:09] through back the Book of Ezekiel
[1:13:11] uncovered it he saw the line the offsets
[1:13:14] called a calf nerd it was a lion the ox
[1:13:17] a man the eagle in Ezekiel and it was
[1:13:19] the wheel in the middle of the wheel and
[1:13:21] it was like a chariot just running doing
[1:13:23] you know
[1:13:25] but it was in symbolics and what was
[1:13:27] that that was Israel in Journey the
[1:13:29] prophet said amen
[1:13:31] Israel and her journey down through the
[1:13:34] wilderness
[1:13:35] encourage it right on into the Promised
[1:13:37] Land
[1:13:39] and John sees the same thing in
[1:13:42] Revelation 4
[1:13:45] right right when he sees that he's on
[1:13:49] the throne and the prophet said
[1:13:50] positioned
[1:13:53] in other words set in steel right amen
[1:13:55] because he goes either traveling yeah
[1:13:58] amen the moving of Israel
[1:14:00] Israel we do this thing and you say well
[1:14:02] what how would you understand it without
[1:14:05] a prophet to tell us we couldn't
[1:14:06] understand it right amen right
[1:14:10] I mean to be guessing what these means
[1:14:14] well I think that's a vision yeah like a
[1:14:17] cupid with a little arrow shooting them
[1:14:19] you know
[1:14:20] I think that's what it means well what
[1:14:22] do you no I don't think it means that
[1:14:25] we see a prophet's not telling you what
[1:14:28] he thinks
[1:14:31] he's telling you what the symbols are
[1:14:33] right
[1:14:35] brother Brown says then John speaking of
[1:14:38] it he could see in symbols what it was
[1:14:42] and bring it down to you and I all right
[1:14:45] see then the combat Beast
[1:14:49] is what's all Israel was seen in Journey
[1:14:53] but listen
[1:14:57] did you notice that
[1:15:01] I mean Ezekiel Ezekiel seeing Israel
[1:15:04] right
[1:15:05] John see him at the throne right amen
[1:15:08] not a vast difference
[1:15:13] now where else could you go
[1:15:16] she didn't have to be the prophet right
[1:15:21] if God hadn't sent us a prophet where
[1:15:23] would we be amen we wouldn't have known
[1:15:25] about Ezekiel that's right right we
[1:15:28] wouldn't have known about John
[1:15:30] but we certainly wouldn't have known the
[1:15:32] in between okay man now I hope he was
[1:15:34] catching on what I'm saying about it you
[1:15:36] know country Services see Ezekiel Saw
[1:15:39] Israel and journey
[1:15:42] you know brother Brown who could look
[1:15:44] above and see all these things you know
[1:15:45] what he can see us in Journey
[1:15:50] Ezekiel Saw Israel in Journey Don't you
[1:15:53] think a prophet could see us in Journey
[1:15:54] yes
[1:15:57] was it a haphazard thing to just happen
[1:16:01] that he would back in the church ages in
[1:16:04] those times that he would start talking
[1:16:05] about
[1:16:06] these combat beasts
[1:16:11] and he would say it was Matthew Mark
[1:16:13] Luke and John
[1:16:18] he said see there guarding the book of
[1:16:21] Acts
[1:16:27] all right so you go in the book of Acts
[1:16:30] he says repent everyone and be baptized
[1:16:32] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:16:35] well that ain't red letter yeah
[1:16:38] I'm going to the red letter
[1:16:41] I'm going over here in Matthew and read
[1:16:44] so Jesus in Matthew says baptized in the
[1:16:46] name of the follow us on audio
[1:16:52] now Peter said the Lord Jesus Christ all
[1:16:54] right amen
[1:16:58] well I'll take what Jesus said amen
[1:17:02] I'm glad you will will you
[1:17:07] no Jesus didn't say baptized in the name
[1:17:10] of the Father the name of the son the
[1:17:12] name of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:14] you know
[1:17:16] three different names
[1:17:20] he said baptized in the name of the
[1:17:22] father
[1:17:23] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost all
[1:17:26] one night
[1:17:29] you see Matthew's guard in the book of
[1:17:31] Acts
[1:17:33] right he's telling you about the book of
[1:17:36] Acts he's guarding back
[1:17:38] run around and said see that's where it
[1:17:40] goes Matthew Mark Luke and John he said
[1:17:42] they guard the book of Acts
[1:17:48] if you want to know anything you go in
[1:17:51] the book of Acts and you read
[1:17:55] but then you want to know what it is you
[1:17:56] go back to Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:17:58] said in my name you'll cast out devils
[1:18:02] there's nothing
[1:18:05] right ma'am
[1:18:08] guarding the book of Acts
[1:18:11] in other words guarding even the rest of
[1:18:13] the Gospel of the rest of the writings
[1:18:15] of Paul Peter in them as they wrote
[1:18:18] Matthew Matthew Mark Luke and John is
[1:18:21] guarding them amen
[1:18:24] Peter would come along
[1:18:33] because of Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:18:35] taking place he said now I have a more
[1:18:37] sure word of Prophecy amen right within
[1:18:40] his heart he had an experience
[1:18:42] of what happened on
[1:18:45] amount of transfiguration we know right
[1:18:50] now you see what the prophet's doing
[1:18:51] he's given us the Journey of the combat
[1:18:54] bees
[1:18:58] there's no writing here to pull this
[1:19:01] from
[1:19:04] you know what I mean
[1:19:06] you didn't say well this church yet he
[1:19:08] was under this and this church ages
[1:19:10] under that and this this here and this
[1:19:12] is here not right now
[1:19:15] you don't even have symbols
[1:19:19] Ezekiel you had symbols right
[1:19:22] of Israel and travel
[1:19:25] but you don't have that
[1:19:28] but a prophet picked that part up and he
[1:19:31] said see then you can see now Matthew
[1:19:33] Mark Luke and John
[1:19:37] as they guard the book of Acts
[1:19:41] right
[1:19:42] then he picked up and he said
[1:19:46] getting ready for the seals to break
[1:19:49] you begin to talk about the combat Beast
[1:19:51] chapter five I mean uh he mentioned it
[1:19:54] away back because it's in the church Age
[1:19:58] series but then he goes over mainly to
[1:20:01] the fifth seal governing the combat
[1:20:03] Beats
[1:20:05] he said see they're lying the ox a man
[1:20:07] the eagle
[1:20:09] and you ain't got scripture there to
[1:20:11] read from
[1:20:13] do you understand
[1:20:16] but we got a prophet
[1:20:18] that's right
[1:20:20] to tell us what the scriptures are
[1:20:22] saying
[1:20:23] amen then we can read descriptions right
[1:20:25] is that the way it's supposed to be
[1:20:28] then that way it's not our ideas
[1:20:33] he said one day he said our individual
[1:20:36] he said these combat beasts are thus
[1:20:38] saith the Lord
[1:20:40] that's right you remember that I gave
[1:20:42] them to you so it's coming down
[1:20:47] and he covers line that cops Amanda
[1:20:49] Eagle he said that line went out in that
[1:20:52] early church age to combat that
[1:20:54] Antichrist
[1:20:55] and went forth into anti-teaching
[1:20:59] a teaching contrary the word right
[1:21:03] and he said that line lashed it down
[1:21:06] even as much as and he's still all the
[1:21:09] way through the church you know the
[1:21:10] church ain't you but just the ministry
[1:21:12] part of it because it was a power among
[1:21:15] the people remember
[1:21:16] that's right
[1:21:18] it wasn't just
[1:21:21] them in the book of Acts right but Paul
[1:21:24] and then even come on out with irenius
[1:21:27] and polycar it wasn't just them it was a
[1:21:29] power among the people
[1:21:36] my brother Gary Atkins said
[1:21:39] that Beast that Zoom Beast
[1:21:42] wrong one if he gets any power you got
[1:21:46] to get you and I
[1:21:50] who gave that beast power in the Dark
[1:21:52] Ages who killed the people
[1:21:55] not a demon
[1:21:58] right
[1:22:00] come on it was in a demon that got in
[1:22:02] people that gave him the seat of
[1:22:05] authority in their life
[1:22:07] right
[1:22:09] was he down through there then that
[1:22:11] second one that Ops starting entire and
[1:22:13] going through the Dark Ages
[1:22:16] yep
[1:22:20] sure wasn't that through that Dark Ages
[1:22:23] they would be giving her life for the
[1:22:24] gospel read thoughts of The Book Of
[1:22:26] Martyrs about all of the people 68
[1:22:28] million of their own record the
[1:22:30] catholic's record
[1:22:33] under that Arch
[1:22:35] that sacrificial
[1:22:40] then he covers what
[1:22:42] the third Beast is what the man
[1:22:45] he said see there the others were
[1:22:47] animals we said now it's a man named
[1:22:50] shrewd he said that Antichrist wrote out
[1:22:53] with charging for prayers
[1:22:55] all kind of things
[1:22:57] he said man rode out against it
[1:23:00] Martin Luther come out sitting the dress
[1:23:02] she'll live by faith
[1:23:09] but it was the spirit of God Among the
[1:23:12] people right amen
[1:23:14] in that age right
[1:23:18] he calls them like Wesley Luther
[1:23:21] Knox any Calvin all of them
[1:23:26] great men that through their
[1:23:28] intellectual ability down through there
[1:23:30] was when they brought in the printing
[1:23:32] press
[1:23:36] to the smart man but see the Catholic
[1:23:39] had taken the Bible away from the people
[1:23:40] they could only read what they wanted
[1:23:41] them to read all right but here come
[1:23:44] excuse me here come the the anointing
[1:23:47] upon man to start making printing
[1:23:50] presses and doing all kind of things
[1:23:52] right
[1:23:54] and when they did then you come out what
[1:23:55] you know is the Bible
[1:24:00] from the shrewdness of man
[1:24:04] a power among the people
[1:24:08] but then when you come down to the
[1:24:09] fourth one what is it
[1:24:11] fourth one was an eagle
[1:24:15] we get out of the fourth one say the
[1:24:17] eagle oh yeah we can understand that
[1:24:18] that was brother Brown
[1:24:22] all right
[1:24:25] all right
[1:24:28] George Paul the lion right
[1:24:32] George Luther the man
[1:24:37] but what about the power among the
[1:24:39] people well we ain't supposed to have
[1:24:40] anything
[1:24:42] we just sat there and waiting on the bus
[1:24:44] to pull up when these days are all going
[1:24:46] to be a win that's why they started and
[1:24:48] now I've told you what I plain about it
[1:24:50] that's why they started all of that that
[1:24:52] brother randoms come got to come back
[1:24:54] put up the tent go across the country
[1:24:56] and preach
[1:24:58] well
[1:25:00] I've always said what I believed about
[1:25:02] it
[1:25:03] and put it in plain language here in the
[1:25:05] church that's 30 40 days between the
[1:25:08] resurrection and the time of the change
[1:25:09] of the body and the Rapture he preached
[1:25:11] all he wants to about the country to the
[1:25:13] people that's no problem
[1:25:15] but it's not sitting down waiting on the
[1:25:17] bus
[1:25:19] what if you go up here to Gainesville
[1:25:21] like I've told you before about it
[1:25:23] the old bus depot used to be down at the
[1:25:26] train station
[1:25:30] that was where it was at down at the
[1:25:32] train depot was where the bus depot was
[1:25:34] at same place
[1:25:37] but when brother for cash come that time
[1:25:39] he wanted me to take him up busty boy I
[1:25:41] said there's not one in Gainesville they
[1:25:43] closed out the one at the railroad track
[1:25:45] he said they got one I said they don't
[1:25:48] have one
[1:25:49] I know where it used to be this closed
[1:25:51] out
[1:25:52] he said well here's the number call it
[1:25:55] he knows more about the time to you I
[1:25:58] called him it was up in town
[1:26:00] they had put the dust bus depot up in
[1:26:02] town but I pointed what are you sat down
[1:26:04] at the railroad track waiting on the bus
[1:26:06] depot all right
[1:26:10] all right if nothing else after
[1:26:12] five-fold industry's job right we get
[1:26:14] you set in the right place
[1:26:16] right well you won't be waiting at the
[1:26:19] train station for the bus right sorry
[1:26:23] we'd be set in the right place to get
[1:26:26] ready
[1:26:31] but you see in that you know all the
[1:26:33] other everybody will agree that the line
[1:26:34] the officer man was a power among the
[1:26:37] people you know all the people that age
[1:26:40] and 68 million being killed certainly
[1:26:43] wasn't just one man was it all right
[1:26:48] Paul Irene is a comma you're the wind
[1:26:51] just Columbia
[1:26:55] Martin and you wait there's one
[1:27:01] there's one we see why can't we see it's
[1:27:02] the power among the people that's right
[1:27:04] that's right
[1:27:08] why can't we see them the things that we
[1:27:10] brought out at the last our Wednesday
[1:27:11] night
[1:27:16] ask those Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:27:19] guard the book of Acts
[1:27:24] okay you go along with that of the
[1:27:27] guards of the altar well so is the line
[1:27:29] the oxalom and the eagle to guard in the
[1:27:32] church ages that's right
[1:27:35] thank you
[1:27:37] then we want to just do something to do
[1:27:39] away with it do something do away with
[1:27:40] it
[1:27:41] what do you want to do to that farm
[1:27:44] leave it where's that right
[1:27:47] even in the Antichrist he gets off the
[1:27:50] White Horse and gets on a red horse you
[1:27:53] know what the White Horse just keeps
[1:27:54] going right amen that white horse is a
[1:27:57] power among the people it just keeps
[1:27:59] right on going it's still riding today
[1:28:01] every no no no it's a red horse and a
[1:28:04] black horse isn't it
[1:28:05] yeah
[1:28:08] but you see that's what we think
[1:28:12] we think we're smart we really got it
[1:28:14] figured out
[1:28:15] brother Dale don't understand
[1:28:20] that Antichrist was a white horse when
[1:28:22] he got all gone red white horses
[1:28:24] disappeared now showed me that in the
[1:28:25] message in the Bible
[1:28:27] said he rides all the way
[1:28:31] now you if you want the direct quote
[1:28:33] I'll give it this way and you figure it
[1:28:35] out he said that white horse rider the
[1:28:38] Antichrist rides to Eternity you want
[1:28:41] that quote that's right
[1:28:46] he don't stop
[1:28:48] he said wait a minute you put an eternal
[1:28:50] life no oh brother Brown didn't say it
[1:28:52] read the quote I'll be glad to get it
[1:28:53] for you he said he rides too eternity he
[1:28:56] loves difference in riding to Eternity
[1:28:58] and going into eternity a lot of
[1:29:02] difference
[1:29:04] but you see Church
[1:29:07] then those combat beasts was guarding
[1:29:10] down through there that's right yep
[1:29:12] that's right
[1:29:13] when that Antichrist got off one horse
[1:29:15] got on another one another Ministry just
[1:29:17] come in because the Bible said when the
[1:29:19] enemy comes in like a flood and spirit
[1:29:20] of the Lord will raise up a standard
[1:29:22] right
[1:29:25] that line Ministry of the true word of
[1:29:28] God is still here today
[1:29:30] because he's Hebrews 13 8. all right the
[1:29:34] ox is still here why because like I was
[1:29:36] saying a moment ago
[1:29:37] why would I want to take away somebody's
[1:29:40] little bit of thing that they've got
[1:29:44] why can't we
[1:29:46] buy with them
[1:29:49] why can't we think about the Beast of
[1:29:51] Burden no bless God I'm an eagle I'm a
[1:29:54] ripper with a beak
[1:29:56] yeah
[1:29:57] yeah
[1:30:00] but you better remember in this day it
[1:30:03] all winds up together that's right
[1:30:05] the lion the ox the man and the eagle
[1:30:07] that's right the shrewdness of man is
[1:30:10] still here even in this old day old
[1:30:12] brain
[1:30:15] that keeps me from being caught with
[1:30:17] these old doctrines that goes around it
[1:30:19] catches 99 of the people amen especially
[1:30:23] preachers
[1:30:24] why can't you see that that
[1:30:27] man Ministry is still right here
[1:30:30] brother brought him sitting Luther
[1:30:32] looked at it and said that cannot be
[1:30:36] right
[1:30:37] that is just the blood
[1:30:40] of an animal
[1:30:43] it is not even the blood of Jesus
[1:30:48] come on
[1:30:50] why can't we still use that brain today
[1:30:53] see that doctrine of Two Souls seven
[1:30:56] Thunders peruses River Jordans
[1:30:58] it's not true
[1:31:00] that's right why
[1:31:02] because we've got enough sense
[1:31:06] to be able to figure it out
[1:31:10] some of the things you don't even need
[1:31:12] to Holy Ghost to figure out for you
[1:31:14] right right
[1:31:17] that's right you know there's ministers
[1:31:18] in this message says the great
[1:31:20] revelation of the seventh seal is
[1:31:21] polygamy
[1:31:24] you can have all the lies you want
[1:31:29] well it don't take no Holy Ghost to
[1:31:31] figure that one out
[1:31:36] right it don't take a holy ghost to find
[1:31:39] out that's wrong
[1:31:44] playing Common Sense shows you that
[1:31:46] ain't right right man
[1:31:49] could you see that line the ox the man
[1:31:51] and the eagle is all here at one time in
[1:31:54] the end time
[1:31:55] that's right amen that prophet of God
[1:31:57] had all of those Ministries
[1:32:00] bottled up into one man what about that
[1:32:03] yeah
[1:32:06] come on you tell me that that man didn't
[1:32:08] have it wouldn't he strike on the word
[1:32:11] he said you can't get an eagle off the
[1:32:13] word right man
[1:32:15] but then he'd turn around and bear with
[1:32:17] people and go do what they said to do
[1:32:19] instead of what God even said to do some
[1:32:21] of that sure
[1:32:22] because he was an ox
[1:32:26] I remember one it really caught me he
[1:32:28] said he was going to preach in a place
[1:32:30] one time and said this man said run
[1:32:31] around and said I know how you preach he
[1:32:33] said and I believe it but he said most
[1:32:35] of my people are legalism
[1:32:38] you remember that quote
[1:32:41] run around and said I wanted to hug you
[1:32:45] well you know he didn't preach against a
[1:32:47] lot of things when he preached that
[1:32:48] night
[1:32:50] he said I wanted to hug the man just
[1:32:52] because he had the love of the people in
[1:32:54] his heart right amen why have we lost
[1:32:57] the love of the ox and the things you
[1:33:00] know the burden to put up with one
[1:33:02] another
[1:33:03] Pride we lost that app
[1:33:09] like I always tell you see everything I
[1:33:11] don't like to be like I am but I'm just
[1:33:13] made this way I'm sorry forgive me
[1:33:16] a lot of you I heard you even say I
[1:33:19] don't see why in the world I can't see
[1:33:20] that
[1:33:21] go when I come in a message I sing it
[1:33:24] right off
[1:33:27] and here I am saying why did it take me
[1:33:30] two years to pound that into your head
[1:33:33] but that wasn't right
[1:33:36] that you see I'm an ox
[1:33:41] I don't beat you today you think I do
[1:33:47] and I see some of you that still ain't
[1:33:49] pounded into your heads about some of it
[1:33:51] but yet you sing it when you first
[1:33:53] single first time I heard that I seen it
[1:33:55] no you're lying through your teeth
[1:33:59] actually in combat beats for all four
[1:34:02] right here now right that's right this
[1:34:04] age the power among the people amen
[1:34:08] that's why I wrote around and made the
[1:34:10] statement then
[1:34:14] he told us about the theorons and the
[1:34:17] two different words and then he come
[1:34:18] down you remember how we was ending up
[1:34:20] the other night
[1:34:23] and we came down to what brought him
[1:34:24] Adam and had brother Brown had to say
[1:34:26] about it
[1:34:29] I won't call him to pull these up
[1:34:36] but you remember when we got over to the
[1:34:39] paragraph 186
[1:34:43] of the seal book The Fifth seal
[1:34:46] the fourth Beast was sent forth to
[1:34:47] combat the Antichrist in his last Beast
[1:34:49] he's talking about the right he said the
[1:34:51] fourth
[1:34:52] fourth living Beast was an eagle
[1:34:55] now you just out of the ages instead of
[1:34:57] the scriptures it's the eagle in the
[1:35:00] Bible the life's age was an eagle age
[1:35:01] and God Likens the ego To His prophets
[1:35:05] okay
[1:35:10] on the last Age The Eagle age a revealer
[1:35:13] of the truth
[1:35:16] he sends down the Eagle at the end of it
[1:35:19] Likens his Eagle to profits see we don't
[1:35:21] want to say Prophet one all right if you
[1:35:25] only go ahead with the next one then
[1:35:28] 70.
[1:35:30] you remember what we were talking about
[1:35:32] the astronaut
[1:35:33] age
[1:35:35] this is the astronaut age this is the
[1:35:37] eagle age we've got Eagles
[1:35:41] you remember that Wednesday
[1:35:43] Prophets
[1:35:45] Rising into the heavens
[1:35:48] well yeah there you go you're looking
[1:35:50] for somebody up no survey and not me to
[1:35:54] take it over either
[1:35:57] God's already done it
[1:36:00] the eagle arrived in the prophet's
[1:36:03] Ministry that's right he said I'm
[1:36:05] looking for this great one to come
[1:36:10] that word he brought around go any
[1:36:12] higher than the opening of the seals and
[1:36:14] he was looking for the great one to come
[1:36:18] he said well he preached marriage and
[1:36:19] more excuse me my mind is still good I'm
[1:36:22] 72 but it still remembers that the seals
[1:36:25] was revealed the American divorce was
[1:36:27] revealed and sealed
[1:36:32] the Rapture was revealed in the sea
[1:36:34] right
[1:36:37] yeah serpent seed was revealed in the
[1:36:39] sea of which was preached in 58 right
[1:36:43] come on
[1:36:45] but church do you understand what he's
[1:36:47] saying
[1:36:48] yes
[1:36:49] we got Eagles prophets reminds me look
[1:36:52] at the next one
[1:36:55] this is a revealer of the truth
[1:36:57] that's been falling all through the age
[1:36:59] now we know who brought the crew
[1:37:01] but how could it ever be revealed
[1:37:04] until the Eagles
[1:37:07] plural land come
[1:37:11] on
[1:37:12] look at the next one
[1:37:17] healed away
[1:37:19] from them until the age of the Eagles
[1:37:21] appeared
[1:37:25] well right down to where it's supposed
[1:37:27] to be right
[1:37:28] right
[1:37:29] I didn't
[1:37:31] did they give you these others 20 no 20
[1:37:34] yeah I gave him 20. okay he's ahead of
[1:37:36] me today let's meet me today but I told
[1:37:38] him I wouldn't go to use no quote no we
[1:37:40] just don't breathe but look what he said
[1:37:42] now remember he see his people being
[1:37:45] Eagles
[1:37:46] especially His prophets and then he
[1:37:49] likened himself to an eagle he's Jehovah
[1:37:51] eagle and we are his English the little
[1:37:54] ones and how he feeds us with his own
[1:37:57] mouth interruptive her life
[1:37:59] look
[1:38:00] there's nothing will take its place
[1:38:04] not nothing will take the place of the
[1:38:06] Eagles
[1:38:07] but the real food Eagles food and we are
[1:38:10] eagles so we have to have Eagles food
[1:38:13] not social again they're not political
[1:38:16] speeches not some little sticks and soul
[1:38:18] party but we need some Eagles food fed
[1:38:21] from the mouth of Jehovah Eagle that's
[1:38:23] why he likened
[1:38:24] us unto Eagles
[1:38:28] Eagle is a far stronger bird he can fly
[1:38:31] higher than any other bird that there is
[1:38:33] and that's the reason Jehovah likened us
[1:38:35] to unto Eagles you just simply can lift
[1:38:38] up higher than the ordinary bird I mean
[1:38:42] I'm specially speaking about eagles
[1:38:45] Jehovah's what
[1:38:47] voice amen
[1:38:49] you see what I'm talking about
[1:38:51] amen
[1:38:54] rise up on wings of an eagle
[1:38:59] but you see we don't want to make it all
[1:39:00] in brother Brown
[1:39:04] then you missed the whole book of
[1:39:06] Revelations
[1:39:07] you're speaking of the bride of Christ
[1:39:12] example yep
[1:39:14] all right
[1:39:17] then no wonder people don't understand
[1:39:18] the message or the hour
[1:39:23] because they're trying to understand it
[1:39:25] and making themselves some kind of a of
[1:39:28] a crow or a
[1:39:30] good Hulk
[1:39:34] the coach run around was the eagle
[1:39:42] but Robin said it was a power among the
[1:39:44] people right
[1:39:48] I didn't make these quotes your Prophet
[1:39:51] did
[1:39:52] when the Eagles the world
[1:39:56] would appear
[1:39:58] when the Eagles would come
[1:40:04] thank God for the prophet that brought
[1:40:07] the message amen because you and I
[1:40:09] couldn't comprehend of us being Eagles
[1:40:12] if he hadn't come and laid the way amen
[1:40:14] that's right like I've always told you
[1:40:16] we spend a lot of emphasis and thank God
[1:40:19] it's true David did kill Goliath
[1:40:24] but then David didn't have to fight no
[1:40:26] more
[1:40:27] why because the children of Israel rose
[1:40:30] up and went after the enemy
[1:40:34] I think it's about time you and I catch
[1:40:36] on
[1:40:37] what's going on
[1:40:45] a true Eagle will understand
[1:40:47] if he's a true evil
[1:40:51] if not he'll try to interpret it by
[1:40:53] being a crow or a
[1:40:56] buzzard
[1:41:00] maybe a hawk
[1:41:03] it won't show her High Enough
[1:41:08] we got to be an astronaut right right
[1:41:10] how much did the prophet speak about an
[1:41:12] astronaut what Good's an astronaut if
[1:41:14] you don't have a shield for it to go in
[1:41:22] it's been up 42 000 feet I think the
[1:41:24] highest I remember recording but you
[1:41:26] know you couldn't go over what 10
[1:41:28] somewhere above 10 000 feet you got to
[1:41:31] have options you know right
[1:41:34] I know we've been ten thousand feet in
[1:41:36] the prop plane so I know it's ten
[1:41:37] thousand feet that you could go without
[1:41:39] an oxygen but after you growing up that
[1:41:42] plane's got to be pressurized
[1:41:45] and you got to have oxygen company
[1:41:47] that's right yeah
[1:41:50] a lot of people have died because of
[1:41:53] being too high you remember I remember
[1:41:54] reading one time where something
[1:41:56] happened on the top of the plane broke
[1:41:58] off we know a lot of people died
[1:42:01] you know why you took all the oxygen
[1:42:04] with it
[1:42:05] and they couldn't drop fast enough to be
[1:42:07] able to save the ones
[1:42:11] you got to be pressurized amen what do
[1:42:14] you think we've been doing 40 something
[1:42:16] years
[1:42:19] trying to get a spaceship built that
[1:42:21] would take us to outer space because
[1:42:23] your profit sin
[1:42:25] interplanetary travel was a type of the
[1:42:28] Rapture right
[1:42:32] right
[1:42:32] interplanetary travel
[1:42:34] so we've been to the moon now we're
[1:42:36] going to Mars we're going on up
[1:42:43] right
[1:42:46] what about it Eagles
[1:42:49] amen
[1:42:51] at least you want to start acting like
[1:42:53] that I remember a man said one time they
[1:42:56] said something about it they were doing
[1:42:57] and I agree with it but as people you
[1:42:59] know they were just
[1:43:01] bubble nights and RAM his one brother
[1:43:03] said boy I think that's so much Eagles
[1:43:05] he said there's probably much chickens
[1:43:07] to me
[1:43:09] I agreed with it because your kids can
[1:43:11] fly
[1:43:15] but somebody's going to get out of here
[1:43:20] somebody's going to be changed I'm on
[1:43:22] the shrink them enough
[1:43:26] somebody's going short with the Eagles
[1:43:30] right and the message
[1:43:33] I'm preaching unto us
[1:43:35] the things that we have need of that's
[1:43:38] right
[1:43:41] what is that song about the Little
[1:43:42] Eagles Fly you know
[1:43:45] flap your wings Little Eagles just about
[1:43:47] time okay sure I know there's been a lot
[1:43:50] of fanaticism went with the message of
[1:43:52] talking about eagles because everybody's
[1:43:54] wanting to become Papa evil
[1:43:56] right
[1:43:59] I have a lot of people come around
[1:44:01] trying to stuff it down your throat
[1:44:02] about Papa Eagle you know in other words
[1:44:04] they was the big eagle
[1:44:07] nope
[1:44:09] you had one eagle
[1:44:11] brother Brown was the one that brought
[1:44:13] the message there's not another to bring
[1:44:15] the message there's just egos to eat
[1:44:18] Eagle food and become equals that's
[1:44:22] right and eating Eagle's food won't make
[1:44:24] you chickens okay that's right but
[1:44:27] eating chicken food won't make you evil
[1:44:33] see that's just a foundation of what
[1:44:35] we're going into it right
[1:44:41] but have you caught on
[1:44:44] I've had two people come to me about
[1:44:46] this message
[1:44:48] I mean really come to him and talk to
[1:44:49] him about it now as long as you say I
[1:44:51] enjoyed it and everything I've had two
[1:44:53] people
[1:44:55] I mean really say something that I knew
[1:44:57] they knew what I was talking about
[1:45:02] I think it's about time you wake up
[1:45:06] become Eagles
[1:45:10] find out whether it's Eagle food if it's
[1:45:13] not Eagle food go somewhere else where
[1:45:14] there is some
[1:45:21] but what about a power among the people
[1:45:25] like I said the other day who made it to
[1:45:27] work such a way you ride down the road
[1:45:29] and on houses that are not even related
[1:45:31] to in any way Christianity maybe there's
[1:45:34] Eagles on them
[1:45:35] you want a novelty store
[1:45:38] and they'll have whole racks of eagles
[1:45:41] is that only for the Believers of the
[1:45:43] message to buy
[1:45:48] you know
[1:45:49] right
[1:45:52] it's an eagle age
[1:45:56] science has went beyond all things in
[1:45:59] this age
[1:46:00] it went from a horse and bogey to an
[1:46:03] astronaut
[1:46:08] right
[1:46:12] and somebody's going to be changed come
[1:46:13] on somebody's going to be changed amen
[1:46:19] when I just believe what part of it
[1:46:23] okay
[1:46:24] this thing that opened the Eyes of My
[1:46:26] Heart Lord
[1:46:33] Open the Eyes of My Heart
[1:46:38] and if I stop in the middle of it and
[1:46:40] look at Brother Richard and go then you
[1:46:43] just stop her right there
[1:46:46] tell everybody watch Brother Richard
[1:46:47] come close your eyes and play and sing
[1:46:50] watch Brother Richard
[1:46:53] because he's going to be the key when I
[1:46:54] tell him to hold it there's going to be
[1:46:56] something I want to say
[1:46:58] okay
[1:46:59] let's stand together
[1:47:01] I'm ready
[1:47:38] here
[1:47:52] for out your power and
[1:48:03] just keep playing
[1:48:07] you realize
[1:48:15] with yourself
[1:48:16] so for how many years
[1:48:20] four or five years
[1:48:24] I changed a song when they changed his
[1:48:27] mind or a thought or what we're doing

[1:48:35] you've never been like a normal turkey
[1:48:39] to the minute you sing only believe
[1:48:42] we've always sung what was related to
[1:48:45] what was taking place
[1:48:51] I've always been my wife doing
[1:48:56] I began to see something
[1:49:05] hoping you'd catch on
[1:49:10] seeing what I'm talking about
[1:49:12] the revelation
[1:49:15] and we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:49:18] we're the legal
[1:49:21] soaring in the skies
[1:49:29] you know
[1:49:36] we're gonna go surely
[1:49:43] every one part I left out of chapter
[1:49:46] four
[1:49:51] all those that are in chapter four one
[1:49:53] day finally

[1:50:25] old testamental well for the new

[1:53:16] this field
[1:53:32] okay
[1:53:42] lay our Crown before the feeder juice
[1:53:45] because if we don't do it here we're not
[1:53:48] gonna lay any ground

[1:53:58] what it means we're not going to change
[1:54:00] it back

[1:56:00] that was to see Lord that we must match
[1:56:02] their
[1:56:03] before we can go there
[1:56:05] so then we got to see you is holy holy
[1:56:08] holy Lord God Almighty
[1:56:11] then we got to cast our crowns as they
[1:56:14] do it in Revelations 4 Lord
[1:56:16] they cast their crowns before you
[1:56:22] giving you all the honor the glory
[1:56:25] and all
[1:56:27] it's not anything that we could do or
[1:56:29] have done
[1:56:31] is what you've done
[1:56:34] you made a way and you gave us a prophet
[1:56:36] to bring us the message
[1:56:38] to show us these things the symbols and
[1:56:40] break them
[1:56:42] but then not to just give us words to
[1:56:44] repeat
[1:56:47] but to speak to our hearts that you may
[1:56:49] be able to take those words that he has
[1:56:51] spoken and be able to Quicken into our
[1:56:53] hearts and lives yes
[1:56:56] see Who We Are
[1:56:59] that Prophet one day said when that
[1:57:01] bride realizes who she is and what she's
[1:57:03] doing here
[1:57:04] but she'll be gone
[1:57:07] so that Satan will be powerless before
[1:57:13] won't have any effect on me
[1:57:19] we thank you Lord
[1:57:22] thank you for being you and revealing
[1:57:24] yourself
[1:57:27] and thank you for revealing us because
[1:57:29] the prophet said
[1:57:31] the bride is part of the mystery
[1:57:33] and must be revealed
[1:57:36] so that's all we're trying to do speak
[1:57:38] about you Lord
