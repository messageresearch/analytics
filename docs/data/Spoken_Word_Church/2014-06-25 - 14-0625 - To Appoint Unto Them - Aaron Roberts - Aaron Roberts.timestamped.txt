[8:44] amen
[8:49] Isaiah 61 verse 1 says the spirit of the
[8:53] Lord is upon me because the Lord hath
[8:54] anointed me to preach Good Tidings to
[8:56] the meek unto the meek he hath sent me
[8:59] to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim
[9:01] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[9:04] of the prison to them that are bound to
[9:07] it proclaimed acceptable year of the
[9:09] Lord and the day events of our God to
[9:11] comfort
[9:12] all that mourn to point unto them that
[9:15] morning Zion to give unto them Beauty
[9:18] for Ashes the oil of Joy unto mourning
[9:20] the Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[9:22] heaviness that they might be called
[9:24] Trees of Righteousness the planting of
[9:26] the Lord that he might be glorified amen
[9:29] amen you may be seated
[9:37] speak a little
[9:38] y'all just pray for him speak a little
[9:39] thought
[9:41] it's called to appoint unto them which
[9:44] is from verse 3 there says to a to a
[9:47] point unto them that mourn in Zion and
[9:51] we know that in the scripture
[9:54] you know Jesus Takes this the same
[9:56] scripture in Luke chapter 4.
[10:00] and Brother Anderson if you want to
[10:02] bring bring that up
[10:05] because Jesus brings out
[10:08] something
[10:10] and we know that the the main point
[10:14] that we usually emphasize when we look
[10:17] at chapter four is that Jesus stopped in
[10:20] the middle of the verse because they
[10:21] only spoke of his first coming and then
[10:23] he stopped because what referred to the
[10:25] second coming he did not read
[10:29] but he said he said and there was
[10:32] delivered unto him the book of isaiahs
[10:34] and when he had opened the book he found
[10:36] the place where it was written he said
[10:37] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[10:39] because he hath anointed me to preach
[10:40] the gospel The Good Tidings the gospel
[10:43] unto the poor because he has sent me to
[10:45] heal
[10:46] which says to bind up he said to heal
[10:49] the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance
[10:51] to the captives
[10:52] now when we go back to when you go back
[10:55] to Isaiah Isaiah says to bind up the
[10:58] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[10:59] catheters and the opening of the prison
[11:02] to them that are bound to proclaim the
[11:04] acceptable year of the Lord but but
[11:06] Jesus when he comes to speak about this
[11:08] he he comes in
[11:11] and he says and recovering of sight to
[11:13] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[11:16] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[11:17] year of the Lord and one of the things
[11:19] when you go back to see what he was
[11:22] talking about because Isaiah says that
[11:24] he says it's the opening of the prison
[11:26] to them that are bound but when you go
[11:28] back to what Jesus was saying because
[11:30] Jesus understood what was what was to be
[11:32] said because he was the one that was
[11:34] speaking originally to Isaiah because
[11:37] but when he said that it was not because
[11:39] they used the word prison but actually a
[11:41] better a better word to be used was a
[11:43] dungeon because you're coming out of
[11:46] Darkness because when they were bound
[11:48] they were in darkness and that's reason
[11:49] he was saying not that they were blind
[11:51] but they lacked light was what he was
[11:53] what he was getting at because the
[11:55] recovering of sight to the blind because
[11:57] you can't see when it's dark and because
[11:59] they were Bound by darkness and so now
[12:02] it's recovering of the sight because
[12:03] they had light
[12:05] because he was the light because that's
[12:07] what John when John Won that's what he
[12:09] said that he came that he was the light
[12:11] that he was John said that he spoke of
[12:13] the light that was to come and so he was
[12:15] the one that was to illuminate and so he
[12:17] said that he has anointed me to preach
[12:20] for the recovering of sight to the blind
[12:22] and he said and to set at Liberty them
[12:25] that are bruised so that's what he came
[12:27] to do because that was the point and so
[12:29] in Isaiah when when he speaks of being
[12:32] in a prison he's actually speaking of a
[12:34] dungeon because they were Bound in
[12:36] darkness but now was to come into light
[12:39] because uh even the scripture tells us
[12:41] you know we come out of Darkness into
[12:43] Marvelous Light because that's what the
[12:45] gospel was to do and you know one of one
[12:49] of the things that I want to speak about
[12:50] is in verse 3 here in Isaiah 61 where he
[12:53] comes in he says he have
[12:56] to a point unto them that are Bruce so
[12:58] he he comes and he speaks of of being
[13:01] anointed man many times people speak on
[13:04] being anointed but I want to speak on
[13:05] what he what he appointed to them and
[13:08] many times in the scripture you can look
[13:09] up the word a point and a point makes
[13:11] means to make a decision but the word a
[13:14] point here has a has a greater meaning
[13:16] to it and and I was started looking
[13:20] through some of the scriptures that
[13:22] speak about
[13:23] um
[13:24] being appointed a point unto them these
[13:27] things well
[13:29] the word appoint
[13:31] and I think Brother Anderson has this
[13:34] here it is the great lexicon to a point
[13:38] he says to put sit lay
[13:42] put lay upon lay violent hands on to set
[13:46] direct toward to extend compassion
[13:49] figurative to set ordain establish found
[13:53] a point constitute make determine fix to
[13:57] set station put set in place plant fix
[14:01] fashion work bring to pass a point give
[14:05] set make for a sign to be set right
[14:09] right so when he said that he to appoint
[14:11] unto them
[14:13] he didn't he didn't make a decision
[14:14] because when he goes back through the
[14:16] scripture he's not making the decision
[14:18] he's actually given them something
[14:19] because he's actually said to give to
[14:22] you these things because it's not just a
[14:24] decision because when you go back
[14:25] through the scriptures when you go
[14:27] through all the way through the
[14:28] scripture from the beginning in Genesis
[14:30] 2 8 is one of the first scriptures you
[14:32] you find this he said that he put the
[14:34] man in the garden because he created The
[14:37] Man Out of the Dust and he set the man
[14:38] in the in the garden and that was it's
[14:40] the same word and you go through all
[14:42] through the scriptures and it's what God
[14:44] is doing it's not what somebody else is
[14:45] doing but it's what God is doing so when
[14:48] he goes to a point unto them these
[14:50] things it's what God is doing it's not
[14:52] what what we have done just like it
[14:54] brother Branham said in
[14:57] and uh invisible
[14:59] the invisible Union of Christ he said
[15:01] Hallelujah now notice he said you're not
[15:04] only that
[15:06] but you're going
[15:08] to the wedding in the sky right
[15:11] he said you are wearing the wedding band
[15:14] of
[15:14] predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding
[15:17] band of Grace unmerited of your own God
[15:19] did it himself he knew before the
[15:21] foundation the world so he slipped the
[15:23] wedding band on you there put your name
[15:26] on a book what a Thanksgiving hallelujah
[15:28] praise our God so it was unmerited favor
[15:31] but it was what God done it wasn't what
[15:33] we done it's what he done and then and
[15:37] you know going on to the adoption series
[15:39] brother Ram said in 1962 he said I don't
[15:42] live true to my wife because I think she
[15:44] divorced me I lived true to my wife
[15:46] because I love her he said it's a legal
[15:49] position that we have taken that we love
[15:51] one another first before it could be
[15:53] there it had to be a love I love her
[15:56] although I believe if I'd done something
[15:58] wrong she'd forgive me still I wouldn't
[16:00] do it anyhow I love her he said that's
[16:02] the same way with Christ I live he said
[16:05] I'm 50. if I live to be 90 or 100 have
[16:07] another 50 years of preaching I never
[16:09] preach a time go down and sit on the
[16:12] river I'm saved anyhow God saved me by
[16:14] his grace unmerited of anything that I
[16:17] ever could do did do or anything else I
[16:20] preach because I love him and I love his
[16:22] people he said and Ah that's the reason
[16:24] I know I've passed from Death unto life
[16:26] because that I love him and I go after
[16:29] them no matter what kind of condition
[16:30] they're in I go after them anyhow go get
[16:33] them anyhow pull them anyhow if
[16:35] ministers disagree and others disagree
[16:37] and denominations disagree that don't
[16:40] stop me there's something it didn't stop
[16:42] him he come right in the midst of
[16:44] unbelief and it didn't stop him he moved
[16:46] right on anyhow that's what we do go out
[16:49] and get them catch them anyhow no no
[16:51] matter reach
[16:53] grab hold on with all your might you
[16:55] don't know who they are save them that's
[16:58] because of love not because that I have
[17:00] to because I love because you love
[17:05] man so it's because of what he's done
[17:08] it's not what we've done it's not we
[17:09] what we could do
[17:14] yeah and I'm so thankful for that
[17:16] because
[17:18] there's nothing in in us that's any good
[17:20] or anything that we can do it ourselves
[17:22] but it's only by his grace that we're
[17:24] able to be anything in this life of what
[17:27] God has given us because it's unmerited
[17:30] favor
[17:31] but if so continuing on here
[17:34] when we see when he talks about being
[17:37] appointed
[17:39] having having these things to appoint
[17:41] unto them and when we look at the word
[17:44] appoint
[17:45] not only we see but all the things that
[17:48] that God has has uh said in the
[17:51] scripture
[17:52] one of the other types that that you
[17:54] find where brother uh where this comes
[17:57] out in the is in the message is uh in
[18:00] the scripture rather is when God is
[18:02] speaking to Abraham
[18:04] and he speaks to Abraham and he tells
[18:06] him he said can you count the Sands of
[18:08] the sea and he said that's how I've made
[18:11] your seed as a sand to the seed because
[18:13] it's innumerable he said your seed is
[18:15] also and you and you go on and even when
[18:17] he continues to tell later on you'll
[18:19] find out he even talks to Jacob and and
[18:23] later on in Genesis I believe it's in 30
[18:26] chapter 32 of Genesis you'll find out
[18:28] where he comes back to to Jacob and
[18:30] tells him and he's speaking of the same
[18:32] promise that he made to Abraham and he
[18:34] said your seed shall be as a sand of the
[18:36] sea and it's the same one because he
[18:38] made it and even though Jacob was
[18:40] standing there saying God if you take
[18:42] care of me if you protect me from Esau
[18:44] you know if you do all these things and
[18:46] God was trying to speak to Jacob the
[18:48] whole time and he laid down on the Rock
[18:50] there that that night and he said he saw
[18:53] the Angels descending and ascending and
[18:55] he was moved by what he saw and he was
[18:57] still praying for God for his blessings
[18:59] when God kept telling he said you don't
[19:02] have to pray for a blessing you already
[19:03] blessed why because you are the Seed of
[19:06] Abraham you already have that seed and
[19:09] you can't do anything to get it and you
[19:11] can't do anything to lose it why because
[19:13] it's unmerited favor to you
[19:17] and so he was standing there and you
[19:18] know and all those type things and when
[19:20] he kept trying to deal with God and
[19:23] God's trying to get him to understand
[19:24] you already have it right right and so
[19:27] you know all the way through the
[19:28] scripture you know what many times we
[19:30] find in the scripture that we we stand
[19:32] there and brother random talks about him
[19:34] many times and you know we we asked God
[19:36] for these things and ask God for these
[19:38] things while they're already ours
[19:41] man he said it's the father's good
[19:42] pleasure to give you the Kingdom so
[19:44] there's no need of you trying to ask and
[19:46] beg for something it's already yours but
[19:49] the problem is is he said if Jesus was
[19:51] standing right here tonight he couldn't
[19:53] heal you because it's already done but
[19:56] you have to have faith to believe it but
[19:58] it's already been given unto you it's
[20:00] been appointed unto you and so as we get
[20:04] to hearing the scripture a little bit
[20:06] later but I want to bring some of these
[20:08] things out because it's so amazing
[20:09] because when you see the things that
[20:11] that the scripture talks about
[20:14] it not only does he talk about something
[20:16] that's going to take place but all the
[20:19] things that
[20:20] throughout the scripture
[20:22] that these things just really come out
[20:24] to you see uh
[20:28] uh
[20:29] let's go to Genesis 24.
[20:33] and I want to uh
[20:35] speak of
[20:43] just want to run through just pull out a
[20:46] few things and
[20:47] y'all just pray for me though there's a
[20:49] lot of things to say and don't don't
[20:50] know exactly which way to
[20:53] to go let's go back to uh
[20:56] let's go back to 20 uh
[21:00] go back to verse one if you can Brother
[21:03] Anderson let's go back
[21:06] Genesis 24 verse 1.
[21:09] but anyway uh
[21:12] I gave him a scripture and I didn't
[21:14] start at the beginning I'm sorry but
[21:15] anyway Abraham
[21:17] Genesis 24 verse 1 it says and Abraham
[21:20] was old and well stricken in age and the
[21:22] Lord had blessed Abraham in all things
[21:24] and Abraham said unto his eldest servant
[21:28] of his house that ruled over all that he
[21:30] had pray out he said put I pray thee thy
[21:32] hand under my thigh
[21:34] you know make thee swear by the Lord the
[21:36] god of Heaven and the god of the Earth
[21:40] and thou shalt not take a wife unto unto
[21:43] my son of the daughters of the
[21:44] Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou
[21:46] shalt go unto my country and to my
[21:49] Kindred and take a wife unto my son
[21:51] Isaac and the servant said unto him pray
[21:54] a venture the woman will not be willing
[21:55] to follow me unto this land must I needs
[21:58] bring thy son again unto the land from
[22:01] whom thou camest
[22:03] and Abraham said unto him beware
[22:05] that thou that thou bring not my son
[22:09] thither again the Lord God Of Heaven
[22:11] which took me from my father's house and
[22:14] from the land of my Kindred which spake
[22:16] unto me and that swear unto him saying
[22:18] unto thy seed will I give this land he
[22:21] shall send his Angel before thee and
[22:23] thou shalt take a wife
[22:25] unto my son from thence and if the woman
[22:28] will not be willing to follow thee then
[22:31] Thou shalt be clear from this mine oath
[22:34] only bring not my son thither again and
[22:37] the servant put his hand under the five
[22:38] Abraham his master and swear to him
[22:40] concerning that matter
[22:43] and when we go back to look at this when
[22:46] Abraham has Eliza come to him to make
[22:49] this Covenant that he would go and look
[22:51] for a wife for Isaac he tells him to put
[22:54] his hand he said pray I put your your
[22:57] hand under my thigh
[22:59] because and
[23:00] the reason the reason that is is because
[23:03] in the in the test in the scripture when
[23:05] you talk about the thigh that's where
[23:06] the power it metaphorically is is
[23:09] referring to power it refers to strength
[23:12] that's the reason in the Book of
[23:13] Revelation it says that the name word of
[23:16] God was on his thigh because that talks
[23:18] about the power that's because
[23:20] metaphorically in a person your thighs
[23:23] is where you have the strength leading
[23:25] up to your hips and your pelvic region
[23:27] that's where you're that's where your
[23:28] strength lies and so that's what he's
[23:30] saying he said put your hand under here
[23:31] we're under my thigh and he swore the
[23:33] the uh
[23:35] the oath unto him but when he when he
[23:38] was talking about swearing that oath and
[23:40] he said pre-adventure that she won't
[23:42] come
[23:43] and and Abraham stood there and told
[23:45] Eliezer he said my he said the Lord is
[23:48] will send an angel before thee he said
[23:51] he said he said that you are going to go
[23:55] and look for a wife
[23:57] see Abraham wasn't wishy-washy about it
[24:00] he wasn't he wouldn't say he's saying
[24:01] you go into this land and get a wife
[24:05] don't look for one but go get one right
[24:08] you're not hunting for one you're not
[24:10] maybe going to find one but because he
[24:12] said he said because Abraham said my the
[24:15] Lord will send his Angel before you and
[24:17] you will determine who the wife is and
[24:20] then when he says he said but prevention
[24:23] she won't come he said well then you'll
[24:25] be clear of this you'll be clear of this
[24:27] oath but hey see he had he had a
[24:30] revelation of what was going to take
[24:32] place so even though Eliezer was just
[24:34] going there was a Abraham had the
[24:36] Revelation to tell him this is what's
[24:38] going to take place and then when when
[24:40] he went then he was able to meet and
[24:42] brother Brandon talks about he said he
[24:43] worked on both ends because Eliza went
[24:46] to find Rebecca and he said at the time
[24:49] that Eliza would be at the well he said
[24:52] the angel of the Lord come and moved
[24:53] upon Rebecca that she would go to the
[24:56] well at the same time that she would be
[24:58] there when Eloise our matter
[25:00] and so even though because you know when
[25:02] he prayed he said let the woman that
[25:04] comes to draw water of me and for all
[25:06] the camels and everything be the one and
[25:08] that's exactly what she came to do
[25:09] because when she came she came to be as
[25:11] a servant unto the eliezar and and so
[25:15] you know that was the one and then when
[25:17] she came she he spoke unto her and I
[25:20] found out from who she was and is in the
[25:22] scripture says that when elas are felt
[25:24] met her and he found out who she was
[25:27] then he placed upon her the same word he
[25:30] placed upon her the gifts of the the
[25:33] earring and the and the bracelets and
[25:35] everything he gave them unto her and
[25:37] then when when he came and met her
[25:39] family that he you know he told the
[25:41] whole story of what was to take place
[25:43] and all the things that had happened and
[25:45] you know then even though she was trying
[25:47] to be drawn away by her family then it
[25:49] was still her choice because the word of
[25:51] the Lord had been quick and unto her
[25:53] brother said that she was moved to go
[25:56] well because she was drawn into this
[25:59] right
[26:00] right and so it was the same thing it
[26:02] was something that was given unto her
[26:04] but it wasn't just just the gifts but it
[26:06] was the word that was quickened to her
[26:08] that Drew her to cause her to leave he
[26:11] wasn't just gifts he just wasn't
[26:13] Thanksgiving unto her but there was
[26:14] something that took place inside of her
[26:16] because the word had been quickened unto
[26:18] her
[26:21] you know brother Brandon said that was
[26:22] the one of the problems that many people
[26:24] have had is he said they they took the
[26:25] gifts and they left the giver they've
[26:28] left they've left the word
[26:33] okay
[26:35] you know I was talking to brother
[26:36] Matthew Bray
[26:38] the other day that's where brother
[26:40] William them go to church and you know I
[26:42] told him I said me people nowadays you
[26:44] find a lot of people in there
[26:46] they turn away from the message you know
[26:48] they find more faults and more you know
[26:49] more wrongs in this message I said the
[26:51] longer I go the more I find that's right
[26:53] in this message the more the more that I
[26:55] stay in this message the more things I
[26:57] find that thrill me in this message I
[26:58] said there's more things that that
[27:00] uplift me in this message I said I'm
[27:02] sorry that nobody else can find it I
[27:04] said but I've been given something
[27:05] that's that's quick in me that's drawn
[27:08] me that no matter I know how many people
[27:10] stand in my way just like as brother
[27:12] random was saying there you know all the
[27:14] people that stand in my way or whatever
[27:16] you know it didn't stop Jesus it's not
[27:17] going to stop me because I love him and
[27:20] I love his people and I'm going after
[27:22] him and you know you keep going forward
[27:24] and you know brother random said that
[27:27] um in the and I
[27:29] you take it for what it's worth I know
[27:31] some people look at it and say well
[27:33] it's so funny that brother Branham was
[27:35] the one that was vindicating brother
[27:36] Branham he was making the references to
[27:38] the scripture that wrote you know that
[27:39] was all the time vindicating himself I
[27:42] said no it Vindicated the scripture I
[27:44] said the scripture was written many many
[27:46] many many years ago by various men from
[27:49] different continents but here came one
[27:51] here came so it's always been written
[27:54] it's it's no it's not any private
[27:56] interpretation it's been all around the
[27:58] world right
[28:00] so this right here hasn't changed but
[28:03] but what came off of these pages is
[28:05] what's what's changed
[28:08] because this is what's different why
[28:10] because as brother Madam said you know
[28:12] we we read the scripture through a
[28:14] denominational eyes we've read it
[28:16] through Darkness why because all of we
[28:19] didn't have the light to shine upon the
[28:21] word but you know the scripture and
[28:23] brother Anderson if you have that quote
[28:25] from the church age book
[28:27] this is from if he's got it from 328
[28:31] let's see if he's got that but anyway
[28:32] you know brother random makes reference
[28:34] talking about the different Prophets
[28:38] here we go he said before we close this
[28:40] section on the messenger the laodice cnh
[28:42] we must seriously consider these two
[28:44] thoughts first this age we'll have one
[28:46] Prophet messenger Revelation 10 7 says
[28:50] when he's singular shall begin to sound
[28:54] there has never been an age where God
[28:56] gave his people two Major Prophets at
[28:58] one time he said he gave Enoch alone he
[29:00] gave Noah alone he gave Moses
[29:03] he alone had the word through others
[29:06] though others prophesied
[29:10] I'm sorry
[29:11] if I start crying y'all just forgive me
[29:16] I said John the Baptist came along
[29:18] and it's last day there is to be a
[29:21] prophet not a prophetess
[29:22] though in this age there are more women
[29:25] purporting to give God's revelation to
[29:27] than men and the infallible word says
[29:31] that he the prophet will reveal the
[29:32] Mysteries
[29:35] to the end time people and to turn the
[29:37] hearts of the children back to the
[29:39] fathers
[29:44] I'm sorry
[29:50] yes
[29:52] I tell you what if there's no stir your
[29:54] soul your spoons fell out of your bowl
[30:01] he said turn the hearts of the children
[30:02] back to the fathers there are those who
[30:04] say that God's people are going to come
[30:06] together through a collective Revelation
[30:08] I challenge that statement it is a bold
[30:10] invalid assumption in the face of
[30:12] Revelation 10 7. now I do not deny that
[30:15] people will prophesy in this last age
[30:17] and their Ministries can and will be
[30:19] correct I do not deny that there will be
[30:22] prophets even as in the days of Paul
[30:24] when there was one egg of us a prophet
[30:27] who prophesied of a famine I agree that
[30:29] is so but I do but I deny upon the
[30:31] infallible evidence of the word that
[30:33] there is more than one major messenger
[30:35] Prophet messenger who will reveal the
[30:37] Mysteries as contained in the word and
[30:40] who has the ministry to turn the hearts
[30:42] of the children to the fathers thus
[30:44] saith the Lord by his unfailing word
[30:46] stands and shall stand and be Vindicated
[30:48] there is one Prophet Messenger to this
[30:50] age on the basis of human behavior alone
[30:52] anyone knows that where there are many
[30:55] people there is even divided opinion on
[30:57] lesser points of a major Doctrine which
[30:59] they all hold together who who then will
[31:01] have the power of infallibility which is
[31:04] to be restored in this last stage for
[31:06] this last stage is going to go back to
[31:08] manifesting the pure word bride
[31:12] that means we will have
[31:15] the word once and once again as it was
[31:18] perfectly given and perfectly understood
[31:20] in the days of Paul now that's you and I
[31:25] I will tell you who will have it it will
[31:27] be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or
[31:31] even more thoroughly Vindicated than was
[31:33] any prophet in all the ages from Enoch
[31:36] to this day because this man will of
[31:38] necessity will of necessity have the
[31:42] Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will
[31:44] show him forth he won't need to speak
[31:46] for himself God will speak for him by
[31:49] the voice of the son amen
[31:55] I tell you what
[31:56] I love that
[31:58] why because that's what he come to do he
[32:01] didn't come to speak of himself he
[32:03] didn't come to prop himself up he come
[32:05] to speak of Jesus Christ
[32:07] he didn't speak of no one else
[32:09] he spoke of him he spoke of what the
[32:12] scripture said
[32:14] there was one man that stood here but
[32:15] because they they said when he's when
[32:17] brother Brandon was here they said he
[32:19] was more like Jesus Christ because there
[32:22] were so many people that thoughts
[32:23] thought so that they actually made him
[32:25] tried to make him Jesus Christ but see
[32:27] he was the one that's going to be
[32:29] thoroughly vindicating this message that
[32:32] through him
[32:33] not that he was trying to make himself
[32:35] something but he was showing the word
[32:37] amen amen he was opening the scripture
[32:40] to us
[32:42] I'm so thankful that we have that
[32:46] why because we'd still all be in
[32:48] darkness we'd all still be wandering
[32:49] around we'd all still have questions
[32:56] but we have someone
[32:59] and brother Branham said
[33:02] he said I must decrease that he might
[33:05] increase he came to bring the word back
[33:07] but he came to point to him that he may
[33:09] become the one right just just as aliens
[33:12] are when elizar came on the scene you
[33:14] know he was the one that he made itself
[33:16] he made Isaac known unto Rebecca but
[33:19] Rebecca could see Isaac people didn't it
[33:23] wasn't seeing brother Branham it was
[33:25] seeing Jesus Christ see Rebecca when she
[33:28] came she was on that Camel and she had
[33:30] traveled all that way with elizar and
[33:32] elizarre expound you know explained and
[33:34] expounded under her Isaac unto her the
[33:38] bridegroom that when she came into the
[33:40] field he was standing in the midst of
[33:42] the field there and you know and she saw
[33:44] him and she put the veil on her face and
[33:46] she jumped off of that Camel and she
[33:48] took off running to him to meet him
[33:51] nobody had to point out and say that is
[33:54] Isaac why because she knew him because
[33:57] of what the word had told her what
[34:00] elizar had expounded to her so it wasn't
[34:02] that we have people already uh
[34:06] confused or missing something why
[34:08] because if you've not heard from him
[34:10] you're not going to see him right
[34:12] because that's what has happened because
[34:14] people are still living on an
[34:16] intellectual idea or some kind of quote
[34:19] but they've never met him they're
[34:21] because to know him is life if you don't
[34:24] know him then you have nothing but he
[34:26] takes him that he comes on the scene and
[34:29] opens a scripture to you that you see
[34:30] him
[34:34] I'm so thankful that we've had that
[34:36] we've had a messenger to come to bring
[34:38] the word but I stand up and say thank
[34:40] God I see him because he's the one that
[34:42] I long to see why because when I look in
[34:45] the scripture I I don't want to see
[34:47] because when I see him I see myself I
[34:49] can find myself in the scripture right
[34:56] as he said
[34:58] you know all that all that God was he
[35:01] poured into the bride
[35:03] only God was he poured into Christ all
[35:05] that Christ was he poured into the bride
[35:07] all that Christ was he poured into the
[35:09] believer all of all that was here is
[35:13] become us
[35:15] there's no one else to
[35:17] to be that right right to be Jesus
[35:19] Christ May manifest in this day but us
[35:24] and I'm so glad
[35:26] we can see Who We Are
[35:29] but we see Rebecca
[35:32] just as Rebecca we've seen who we've
[35:34] seen our Isaac
[35:39] and you know all the way through the
[35:40] scriptures there's many other scriptures
[35:42] to look at but uh
[35:45] you know Joseph was a was another one
[35:48] and in the scripture Joseph
[35:51] you know he was he was
[35:54] I see her
[35:55] and you know and he was hated of his
[35:58] Brethren and you know all the things
[36:00] that that we know about him but you know
[36:02] when he came to the point of going
[36:05] through all the things that all the
[36:07] turmoil in his life and all the things
[36:09] being thrown in prison and all those
[36:10] things but you know God had a plan for
[36:13] him God had a purpose in his life and
[36:15] when he when he came to make himself
[36:16] known to his Brethren said when he came
[36:19] to make himself known unto them then you
[36:22] know he stood there and you know and he
[36:24] opened up to them and he and he told him
[36:27] he said don't be afraid anyone know if
[36:29] his father's still living he told him he
[36:31] said he said don't be afraid he said
[36:33] because God has done this
[36:36] and you know any any and he blessed his
[36:38] Brethren but he said he done this to
[36:40] preserve life
[36:42] and so that was that what was taking
[36:44] place and and through all of and see his
[36:48] Brethren thought they were doing
[36:49] something that was a horrible thing and
[36:51] it was but the thing is is God was using
[36:54] that to take place to bless them and
[36:56] they thought that was for uh hatred they
[36:58] thought it was doing something and come
[37:00] to find out God was using that to bless
[37:02] them right and so you know because it
[37:04] was the same thing that they thought
[37:05] they could do uh something terrible
[37:07] trying to get rid of him and in the end
[37:10] they were blessed by it because he said
[37:12] God has done this to preserve life and
[37:14] so you know as he later laid on them
[37:19] and then other scriptures where he talks
[37:22] about all through the scripture
[37:24] um other scriptures you look at
[37:26] um
[37:29] when Moses was speaking to Elijah when
[37:31] he was talking to pharaoh and he was
[37:34] talking to the children of Israel and
[37:37] and he said that he said I'm incapable
[37:42] but God told him he said you know I've
[37:43] given you these signs I've given you
[37:45] Aaron to go and you go forth and you
[37:47] know even though he tried to do it in
[37:49] his self before and you know he thought
[37:51] he was such a failure God had got him to
[37:52] the exact place that he wanted him to go
[37:54] and then he could go into Egypt and he
[37:57] could go tell Pharaoh let my people go
[37:58] right and you know and the scripture
[38:01] tells us in Exodus
[38:04] chapter 10
[38:07] . hope you don't mind and
[38:10] he said and the Lord said unto Moses go
[38:13] in unto Pharaoh for I have hardened his
[38:15] heart and the Heart
[38:18] of his servants this Exodus chapter 10
[38:20] verse 1 and 2. it said of his servants
[38:22] that I might show
[38:24] those my sons these my signs before him
[38:27] that they thou mayest tell in the ears
[38:31] of thy son and of thy son's son son what
[38:34] things I have wrought in Egypt and my
[38:36] signs which I have done among them that
[38:39] ye may know how that I am the Lord
[38:43] and so it's say it's also the same thing
[38:46] because when he sent him down there he
[38:47] said these are the things that I've done
[38:49] I've done unto them because I'm going to
[38:52] show you my power I'm going to show you
[38:54] who I am that you may know and that you
[38:57] can tell your sons and your Sons Sons
[38:59] and the Next Generation and all that
[39:01] they may know who I am and so he is
[39:04] these things that I've done and it goes
[39:06] down there and tells him tells Pharaoh
[39:08] he said let my people go and and he said
[39:11] no he said I'm going to keep you here
[39:13] because God said but I've hardened his
[39:15] heart that he could show him because you
[39:17] know every time Pharaoh decided he
[39:19] wanted to let him go but he wasn't going
[39:20] to let them go
[39:21] and so you know each one of the things
[39:23] when you go through the scripture
[39:28] when he poured out his power
[39:30] oh you know we poured out the plagues on
[39:32] Egypt you know each one of those plagues
[39:34] that was poured out on Egypt took down
[39:36] one of their gods was was in direct
[39:39] violence you know against conflict
[39:41] against one of the uh Gods of of uh
[39:45] Egypt that they thought they were so
[39:46] powerful you know they prayed for the
[39:48] the god of the Nile and the god of the
[39:50] crops and all these different things and
[39:52] the Sun God and all these different ones
[39:54] and what was it God said I'm the only
[39:56] God that there is and you have no
[39:57] there's no other God but you're praying
[39:59] and you think you have power here but
[40:01] I'm going to show you that I have power
[40:03] and each one of them he come along and
[40:05] said well we're just going to turn the
[40:06] water into blood and he done so and they
[40:08] didn't have one that could do it right
[40:11] and then when you curse the land and all
[40:13] the crops died and all the all the
[40:15] locusts came and each one of the gods
[40:18] that they had he's one of their deities
[40:19] That was supposed to control these
[40:21] things they were unable to stop the
[40:23] power of God and then when even when it
[40:25] came to the death of the firstborn he
[40:27] said listen he said you've got a deity
[40:29] he said but the death angel will pass
[40:31] through but he said you've got to put
[40:32] the butt on the door and on the lentil
[40:35] but you know what I'ma show you and each
[40:37] one of those they kept praying trying to
[40:39] hold on to each one of those little
[40:40] deities each one of their little
[40:42] doctrines or whatever and each one each
[40:44] time it came along God just wiped it off
[40:47] and then he told him he said now he said
[40:50] you can leave he said now he said I want
[40:52] you out of my sight and Moses said
[40:54] you'll never see my face again and it's
[40:56] when he walked out the door and he took
[40:58] on their journey and then when he was
[41:00] leading when he was leading him to the
[41:02] Red Sea you know they were so happy and
[41:04] joyous to see that they were leaving the
[41:07] land of Egypt because they had seen all
[41:09] of the the death and the destruction and
[41:12] the bondage that they had been in but
[41:13] they came to a place and the first time
[41:15] that they had some kind of little
[41:16] difficulty then all they could do was
[41:18] stand up and tell them Moses you've
[41:20] brought us out here to die yeah
[41:24] when God was trying to show them he said
[41:26] I'm going to show you my power that you
[41:28] can show each one of the each one of the
[41:31] generations what I've done and he
[41:33] brought them out there and he told Moses
[41:35] he said stretch forth thy hand with the
[41:37] rod over the water for the waters to
[41:39] part and he parted the waters
[41:42] and he said they started to walk upon
[41:44] dry land
[41:46] so when they started to walk upon dry
[41:48] land then they crossed over and then
[41:51] they saw their enemy in pursuit of them
[41:52] and they thought oh no here comes here
[41:54] comes the enemy and they're going to
[41:56] catch us but they did not realize that
[41:58] they were coming right in to God's trap
[42:00] forum
[42:03] when they come in and then they closed
[42:04] the water up on them
[42:06] and they never would see their enemy
[42:08] again right
[42:11] but you know the
[42:12] they could stand up and rejoice for a
[42:15] short time praise the Lord the horse and
[42:16] Riders fall into the sea and all these
[42:18] things you know that they were destroyed
[42:19] but the next time they had a problem
[42:21] they come right up and all they could do
[42:23] was murmur and complain against Moses
[42:25] and against God because of what he had
[42:27] done for them why because they didn't
[42:29] have water they didn't have food all
[42:32] these type things and not realizing that
[42:33] God was bringing a a blessing upon them
[42:37] every day
[42:40] because the scripture says their clothes
[42:42] never wore out they never got sick they
[42:44] had they had Heavenly food to Feast on
[42:46] every single day and you know all they
[42:48] could do is say oh we loathe this light
[42:50] bread and many times they were standing
[42:52] there and all they could do is look back
[42:53] and say oh if we he just had the fish
[42:55] that we had in Egypt oh if we could had
[42:58] the leeks and the garlics that we had in
[43:00] Egypt and they did not remember the
[43:01] beatings from the taskmasters they did
[43:03] not remember all the things that were
[43:05] brought upon them by the by the
[43:07] Egyptians
[43:09] exactly they thought it was so wonderful
[43:15] and had failed to see all the problems
[43:17] that they had
[43:19] and God stood there and told them even
[43:20] when Nathan and Cora rose up
[43:23] to come against them and he told them he
[43:25] said if these men die a natural death
[43:27] then God is not with us right
[43:30] right but he said but Moses told him he
[43:32] said but the Earth will open up and
[43:34] swallow them and then you'll know that
[43:36] God is with us and whose side God's Own
[43:42] and so when you know when that took
[43:44] place then they were all afraid and you
[43:46] know worshiped and and were were
[43:48] concerned and you know feared
[43:51] until until I got over themselves
[43:54] I didn't know we're right back at it
[43:56] blaming Moses and Aaron for the problems
[43:59] right
[44:01] but all the things that God had done for
[44:03] them the whole time was that he was
[44:05] spinning forth and doing these things to
[44:08] show them who he was
[44:10] and when when you go through and
[44:15] now
[44:16] when you go back and look I'm still
[44:18] talking about the word appoint now when
[44:21] you go back and you look at when when uh
[44:23] God gave Moses the plan to build the
[44:26] Tabernacle in the wilderness
[44:28] oh that's about the whole the whole
[44:32] chapter is is using the is using the
[44:35] same word him giving the the dimensions
[44:37] and all things to to Moses
[44:40] but when you when you look at all the
[44:42] things that he done and when he goes on
[44:44] and
[44:46] not to get into a lot of that but you
[44:48] know when he lays out each one of those
[44:50] types in the in how to lay out the
[44:52] Tabernacle the three the inner the outer
[44:55] court and the holy of holies the colors
[44:57] that were used all the dimensions each
[45:00] one of them spoke of him he had because
[45:02] when you look at it it spoke of God it
[45:04] spoke of Jesus Christ in every aspect of
[45:07] his life because all the way through
[45:09] that's who he was speaking of and and
[45:11] it's so amazing if you get time to start
[45:14] looking at some of those things but you
[45:15] know when he goes and he tells them to
[45:17] build the Ark of the Covenant and you
[45:20] know he tells them he said now build the
[45:21] Ark of the Covenant and he tells uh
[45:25] Moses and he tells them to to make the
[45:27] art and then you know he gave he gave
[45:29] Moses the tablets of the of the law and
[45:32] then he tells him that you know he broke
[45:34] them on the on the golden calf and he
[45:35] said you know take the ones that I've
[45:37] remade and he said now he said put them
[45:40] in there yeah and he said put them in
[45:42] there and then when he took the uh
[45:45] Homer of the Manna and he put that in in
[45:48] there because when you read in the
[45:51] scripture God tells them that he said
[45:53] this is for a covenant he said this is a
[45:57] testimony because you know it's called
[45:59] the aura it's called the Ark of the
[46:00] testimony why because it was God's
[46:03] testimony to them he said why because he
[46:05] said I've done these things to prove you
[46:07] because you know he showed them because
[46:10] in this was the evidence that he was
[46:13] putting in the whole holies of holies to
[46:16] show them that they did not believe that
[46:18] they said God would put all us out here
[46:20] to die he was you know we we were
[46:22] starving and all these things but you
[46:24] know what he put that Manna in there
[46:27] to show that he fulfilled his scripture
[46:29] he kept his word to them but they did
[46:31] not keep his that word to him right
[46:34] right and he'd say and he broke down the
[46:36] scriptures why because the other ones
[46:39] were broken and he wrote them again and
[46:40] he put them in there and so they stayed
[46:43] with the with the Ark of the Testament
[46:44] the Ark of the Covenant and they were in
[46:46] there why because when they looked at
[46:48] those those tablets The Originals were
[46:51] broken on the golden calf why because
[46:53] they went after idolatry and did not
[46:55] stay with the word but you know that was
[46:57] unto him why because he didn't leave
[46:59] them they left him right
[47:02] all the way through the scripture we'll
[47:04] see that he is holding up to them as
[47:06] brother Dale always says when you when
[47:08] you look in the scripture you know he
[47:09] keeps telling them come on to the land
[47:11] Fallen with milk and honey it's time to
[47:13] go to the land flowing with milk and
[47:15] honey showing them they still had a
[47:16] promise to them but they were the ones
[47:18] that did not believe that there was a
[47:21] prophecy there was a fulfillment there
[47:23] was a promise to them for this uh to
[47:26] display this land Right This Promise
[47:28] This blessing unto them
[47:34] and so
[47:40] God brought
[47:42] Moses along
[47:43] another time we see as God was bringing
[47:47] Moses along
[47:48] speaking to him lip to ear
[47:50] and he told he told Mo you know Moses
[47:52] told God said I want to see you he said
[47:55] will you show me yourself and he said he
[47:57] said you can't see me but he said I'll
[47:59] put you
[48:00] he said I'll put you in the cleft of The
[48:03] Rock and he said you can't see my face
[48:05] but he said when I passed by he said
[48:07] I'll put my hand over your face he said
[48:09] but you can see me from behind as I
[48:11] walked past and so he put Moses in the
[48:13] cleft of The Rock and that was the same
[48:15] the same word he put Moses in the cleft
[48:18] of The Rock and he passed by and Moses
[48:20] saw God and so that was the same it's
[48:23] the same meaning so he's showing how he
[48:25] put Moses there because Moses wanted to
[48:27] see him and he and he put him there on
[48:29] the rock for him to see him and so
[48:33] and then there's many other times when
[48:35] in The Book of Leviticus when when Aaron
[48:38] and and Moses Moses is preparing Aaron
[48:41] and his sons for their Tabernacle work
[48:43] and you know they had laid out all of
[48:45] the
[48:46] um the building and the Ark of the
[48:47] Covenant and all those things and you
[48:49] know Moses God tells Moses many times
[48:52] how they were supposed to handle each
[48:55] one of the articles that were to go in
[48:56] the holies of holies and you know he
[48:58] tells them he said you know they're not
[49:00] to touch it lest they die and so he lays
[49:03] he lays out all of the ordinances for
[49:05] them and he tells them how they're
[49:06] supposed to do it
[49:09] and then later on he gives them and
[49:10] because chapter Rachel
[49:12] you'll see where he comes in and he and
[49:15] he gets ready to prepare Moses I mean
[49:17] Aaron and the son the Levites for
[49:19] service and he goes in you know he he
[49:22] washes them and he dresses them and he
[49:24] gets them ready but the only time that
[49:27] you find where he talks about laying
[49:29] upon them in the in this in this word
[49:32] because many times he talks about he
[49:34] dresses them he gets them all prepared
[49:36] but the only time that this is used in
[49:38] in laying out the the levitical
[49:41] priesthood and the proper dressing is
[49:43] when he goes to the place when he put
[49:45] the breastplate on Aaron and when he put
[49:47] the miter on his head was the only time
[49:49] that was used because the rest of the
[49:51] time it's showing that he's just giving
[49:53] Aaron something even though he's
[49:54] dressing him he's giving it to him that
[49:57] he's helping because it's part of what
[49:59] Mo Aaron was doing it's not just him
[50:01] working but it's actually what Aaron was
[50:03] doing but when Aaron had come to the
[50:05] place that he was consecrated and he was
[50:08] anointed to do his work then the prophet
[50:12] Moses laid the laid the breastplate on
[50:15] him that wasn't something that Aaron
[50:17] done that was something that Moses done
[50:19] because that had to be laid upon Him by
[50:21] him and he put the miter on his say it
[50:23] so he was prepared for the finishing at
[50:25] the end a lot of it was done by by Aaron
[50:28] but when it came to the end that was
[50:30] done by Moses
[50:32] and so it's showing the same thing that
[50:34] it was something that that we didn't
[50:36] that he didn't do it was what the
[50:39] prophet had done for him to prepare him
[50:41] for that
[50:43] and many other ones the uh
[50:46] raising putting the brass serpent on the
[50:48] pole all those type things uh
[50:53] all those had to do with laying what uh
[50:58] what God was doing
[51:00] that he told him to raise that that
[51:02] serpent up and that if you would look on
[51:04] it and believe that he would
[51:07] he would heal you so all those type
[51:09] things were part of the uh
[51:13] of what he had given unto them for the
[51:18] so
[51:21] but uh
[51:23] I want to get back over here but
[51:26] I just wanted to there's so many things
[51:27] when you start getting into scripture
[51:29] you start looking at he said he's going
[51:31] yeah
[51:32] yeah and I hope that didn't
[51:34] but I want to I just want I enjoyed it
[51:36] so much but when you come to understand
[51:38] when he said to a point unto them it's
[51:40] not something that he's that he's just
[51:42] decided it's not a decision but it was
[51:45] something that was laid upon them and
[51:46] you go through the scripture and it's
[51:48] all through the scripture if something
[51:49] that he laid upon them when even when
[51:52] you go back through the scripture uh the
[51:55] when when Abraham laid Isaac on the
[51:57] altar was was another one when he laid
[51:59] him on the altar to sacrifice him all
[52:02] those type things are showing something
[52:03] that you know Abraham was laying Isaac
[52:06] on the altar it's the same word Isaac
[52:08] didn't get himself up there Abraham put
[52:10] him on there all those type things are
[52:11] showing what God was doing and he comes
[52:13] and so back to Isaiah 61 here says he
[52:16] said to appoint unto them that mourn in
[52:20] Zion yeah
[52:21] so when he said oh no we're going to a
[52:24] point unto them is to give unto them
[52:26] it's something that he is putting on
[52:27] them because I want you to read these
[52:29] things to understand what he's talking
[52:31] about he said to a point unto them or to
[52:34] lay upon them he said even in the
[52:37] scripture in the scripture predestinated
[52:39] all the different uh the definitions of
[52:42] the word but it was something that was
[52:44] definite
[52:47] to station to and the other one the one
[52:49] I want to get to was to transform
[52:52] to transform into to to trade so all
[52:56] these things to direct to lay upon to
[52:58] station all these things when he talks
[53:01] about to appoint unto them that morning
[53:03] Zion Zion talks about is Jerusalem
[53:06] Jerusalem is
[53:09] and and the scripture talks about is
[53:11] Jerusalem and you know Jerusalem was was
[53:14] the temple
[53:16] and and the most important part was the
[53:18] holy of holies and the holy of holies
[53:20] was the place where God met with man
[53:23] and so when you speak of Zion that's
[53:24] where God meets which is the only place
[53:27] that God met with man was under the shed
[53:29] blood which is under the word
[53:32] and so when he speaks all of them that
[53:33] mourn in Zion
[53:36] and we understand that this is speaking
[53:38] of of Israel coming back into a place
[53:41] where they're being restored
[53:43] and so we understand that but it's unto
[53:46] us
[53:47] a spiritual Zion right
[53:50] right he said to give unto them Beauty
[53:53] for Ashes
[53:56] so this is what he's doing to them he
[53:58] said to a point unto them that morning
[54:00] Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes
[54:03] now the another word when you go back
[54:05] and look
[54:06] you know what
[54:08] to to the word beauty there means an
[54:11] adorning
[54:12] or a headdress or a covering something
[54:15] that is put upon put upon your to on the
[54:18] head because he said he wanted to give
[54:20] give them Beauty for Ashes ashes in in
[54:24] this situation usually refers to
[54:27] uh funeral or death
[54:31] or also refers to worthlessness
[54:36] because when you go back through the
[54:38] scripture when when uh Elsa has to do
[54:40] because it also has to do with mourning
[54:42] and uh
[54:45] repentance and and
[54:47] uh worthlessness and
[54:50] um
[54:51] stress
[54:54] and
[54:55] trials and tribulations because you know
[54:59] there's many times you go back and look
[55:02] um job
[55:03] when when God took it took away the
[55:06] Hedge from job and the Satan was able to
[55:08] pour out all these things upon job then
[55:11] job went sat on said as sackcloth and
[55:14] Ashes so that's what is showing that he
[55:17] was uh he was in a trial or a
[55:19] tribulation and he was sitting in ashes
[55:21] and you know and even when Mordecai
[55:24] found out that Haman had went to the
[55:27] king and had got a decree for all the
[55:30] Jews to die and he had went and told
[55:32] Esther when when he sent the word to
[55:34] Esther Mordecai was in sackcloth and
[55:36] Ashes waiting and saying and they were
[55:38] all in mourning and they were all crying
[55:41] out to God and he sent word to Esther or
[55:43] what was going to take place and told
[55:45] Esther said listen said you won't you
[55:47] won't escape this also because that if
[55:50] they're going to kill all the Jews
[55:51] they'll kill you too
[55:54] and so that's when you know she had to
[55:56] go before the king to get a decree to
[56:00] say this amen
[56:02] amen so and even even when when uh
[56:06] Jonah had went to Nineveh
[56:08] and you know and he rebuked nine of for
[56:10] their sin and everything like that and
[56:12] he said they put it in sackcloth and
[56:13] Ashes and even put sackcloth on their
[56:15] animals because that was a sign of
[56:18] repentance because they they had come
[56:20] under this condemnation and so they
[56:22] decided you know because they come under
[56:24] this repentance so it's showing a
[56:26] worthlessness but it's showing many
[56:28] things that has come upon them and uh
[56:31] even in the scripture when you go back
[56:32] and
[56:34] um
[56:35] I think it was Eamonn which was one of
[56:38] David's Sons amen had
[56:40] a sister named Tamar and Tamar had come
[56:43] under him and you know he said that uh
[56:45] he pretended to be sick and you know he
[56:48] went after his sister and you know he
[56:50] went in and when she after he took and
[56:52] abused her then when she came out from
[56:55] underneath that because she was in such
[56:57] a low state that she came out and said
[56:59] it had ashes upon her head and she went
[57:02] under her brother absalom's house
[57:03] because she was such because she was so
[57:06] devastated because of what had happened
[57:08] so it was showing a low sitting and it's
[57:11] a stress a trial of all these type
[57:14] things and he says but he gives unto
[57:16] them a headdress or an adorning
[57:18] something that's beautiful because of
[57:20] this worthlessness that they feel
[57:22] because there's such a low state but
[57:24] he's laying something upon you because
[57:26] you're in such a low state but here's
[57:28] this beautiful thing that he's adorning
[57:30] you with and so it's sitting upon your
[57:32] head he said Beauty for Ashes he said
[57:35] the all of joy for mourning Joy the all
[57:38] of Joy refers to an anointing
[57:41] because you know all the way through the
[57:43] scripture when you go back and look at
[57:44] the word gladness throughout the
[57:46] scripture David brings that out about
[57:48] being the gladness and having the all of
[57:50] gladness upon him and he talks about the
[57:53] so when he refers to the all of Joy when
[57:55] we know that all the type of the Holy
[57:57] Ghost coming upon you because we know
[57:59] that the type of joy is one of the gifts
[58:01] of the Spirit one of the fruits of the
[58:03] spirit upon you so he said you received
[58:05] all of joy for mourning right
[58:08] so you go through this and you're under
[58:10] this time of of death or this morning
[58:14] this funeral so in the time of of death
[58:17] all the way around because we understand
[58:18] the death angel is passing through the
[58:21] land today because we're in this great
[58:23] time and you know
[58:25] um
[58:26] brother Adam tells the story about the
[58:28] young man standing in there and you know
[58:29] they hear the way the Weeping and the
[58:31] Wailing because the death angel was
[58:33] passing through and the death of the
[58:34] firstborn was taking place and that
[58:36] little boy he was so he was so fearful
[58:39] he said father are we are we okay is it
[58:41] okay are we going to make it right he
[58:43] said Son let me show you he said the
[58:46] prophet has given us the word of God and
[58:48] we lay upon the blood upon the door and
[58:51] upon the doorpost and you know what
[58:53] we're safe and the Death Angel will pass
[58:55] by so he says we've received this all of
[58:58] Joy that's gladness that's uplifting
[59:02] something that's being poured upon us
[59:04] because even even in the Old Testament
[59:06] when the uh the priests were anointed
[59:09] even when David David didn't pour the
[59:11] oil upon himself Samuel poured it on him
[59:14] when the all was poured upon Aaron Moses
[59:17] pulled the ore upon Aaron that he was
[59:19] anointed with so it was a there was
[59:22] something to say showing something
[59:22] that's God's doing for you that you're
[59:24] in a time of mourning whatever your is
[59:26] but he's anointing you with joy
[59:30] he said the Garment of Praise
[59:34] something else because when in the in
[59:37] the New Testament there when because
[59:39] it's an Old Testament type you know when
[59:41] I'm when you come to a person's house
[59:43] and you've been on a long travel and
[59:44] they washed your feet then they gave you
[59:46] a robe to put on they put on a robe on
[59:48] you took off your whirly clothes that
[59:52] you wore on the walking through the you
[59:54] know through the muck and everything and
[59:55] the sweat and the Heat of the day and it
[59:57] was a wonderful new garment that was put
[59:59] upon you and so he says there's a
[1:00:01] Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[1:00:03] heaviness because it was a spirit he
[1:00:06] said it was a a dullness
[1:00:09] or or a faint that you're about to faint
[1:00:15] and the scripture tells us he said they
[1:00:17] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:00:19] their strength they shall Mount up with
[1:00:21] wings as eagles they shall grow walking
[1:00:23] up and be weary they shall walk and not
[1:00:26] faint
[1:00:27] so we can walk because we've received
[1:00:30] this Garment of Praise because he said
[1:00:33] God inhabits the Praises of his people
[1:00:35] so here he comes upon us so we have this
[1:00:38] and Garment of Praise is Thanksgiving
[1:00:40] adoration uplifting God because the
[1:00:44] because if you have this Spirit of
[1:00:46] heaviness upon you he said come unto me
[1:00:48] all ye that labor and a heavy light and
[1:00:50] he said I will give you rest he said
[1:00:53] come and talk to your my yoke upon you
[1:00:55] my birdie of Burden upon you because
[1:00:58] it's light it's it's not this heaviness
[1:01:00] but there's something this yoke is lied
[1:01:03] upon you he said because then he says
[1:01:05] that they may be the Trees of
[1:01:08] Righteousness the planning of the Lord
[1:01:10] that he might be glorified the Trees of
[1:01:13] Righteousness
[1:01:16] that's that's what he's done it's the
[1:01:18] planning of the Lord
[1:01:21] that tree
[1:01:23] Psalms 1 says
[1:01:26] like a man
[1:01:27] tree planted by the rivers of water
[1:01:30] so that's the way that's who we are that
[1:01:33] he says that we have this this planting
[1:01:36] the Trees of Righteousness
[1:01:39] starting out a small but we've actually
[1:01:41] grown up into God's righteousness that
[1:01:43] we he said
[1:01:45] that he might be glorified amen that's
[1:01:48] what we are
[1:01:49] all these things have become upon us but
[1:01:52] you know what none of these things are
[1:01:55] on us as just something that that
[1:02:01] God made a decision
[1:02:05] but you know what when God gave you the
[1:02:08] new birth
[1:02:09] when God Gave You himself when he put
[1:02:12] himself in you come on come on this is
[1:02:14] what he's laid upon you he's laid upon
[1:02:17] these things he's so when you say well I
[1:02:20] don't I don't feel this way that doesn't
[1:02:22] matter you have received these things
[1:02:24] you have received Beauty for Ashes
[1:02:27] you've received the all of joy for
[1:02:30] Mourning
[1:02:31] see things in your life are not going to
[1:02:33] go the way that you want to but you know
[1:02:34] what we have a strength to draw from why
[1:02:37] because these things have been laid upon
[1:02:39] us because you know what all the things
[1:02:41] of that were on us all our sin was right
[1:02:44] upon him that you know what all the
[1:02:46] things that he is has been laid upon us
[1:02:48] and here we are that we can be this tree
[1:02:50] that he might be glorified through you
[1:02:52] and I because that's what he's given to
[1:02:54] us so whatever you have need of you come
[1:02:57] here tonight and say well I have this or
[1:02:59] that no you have what God said you have
[1:03:02] not all everything else is Vanity
[1:03:04] everything else is a lie but you know
[1:03:07] what you have what God is saying he said
[1:03:09] the scripture says that you have been
[1:03:11] given exactly
[1:03:17] because you've received this he said out
[1:03:19] of your bellies not anybody else's but
[1:03:22] out of your bellies shall flow Rivers
[1:03:24] not just a trickle not just a little
[1:03:26] drop here and there but he said rivers
[1:03:28] of Living Water
[1:03:31] that's what's inside of you
[1:03:34] he said everything that the bride had
[1:03:37] need of everything a Believer had need I
[1:03:39] was given to him in the new birth but
[1:03:41] you know what he said there's an
[1:03:42] inexhaustible fountain that you and I
[1:03:44] can drink from he said if we just drink
[1:03:46] from that he said then we can push out
[1:03:48] why because it's inside of us Brother
[1:03:50] Dean for us to make manifest these
[1:03:52] things it's always been there but you
[1:03:54] know we've come to the realization of
[1:03:56] who God is and who we are to make him
[1:03:59] manifest
[1:04:00] that he might be glorified
[1:04:05] no wonder David said I can run through a
[1:04:07] true leap over a wall
[1:04:12] I don't know if I could run but I felt I
[1:04:15] might get I could jog pretty fast
[1:04:20] but that's what God's given us that's
[1:04:22] who we are we have been blessed amen so
[1:04:29] let's all stay in this evening
[1:04:31] I'm so glad that we've received these
[1:04:33] things
[1:04:36] he has anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:04:39] he's anointed us
[1:04:42] and then he come to declare these things
[1:04:44] to us the prophet came to declare these
[1:04:47] things to us
[1:04:49] right he said he said it's not he said
[1:04:51] you're not feeding on the seventh
[1:04:53] Angel's message it's not the messenger
[1:04:56] it's not his message he said but you're
[1:04:58] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:05:00] the son of man
[1:05:07] I'm so glad that
[1:05:10] he's making known these things to us
[1:05:13] I tell you what you start reading
[1:05:14] through there and you start seeing all
[1:05:15] the things that God's done all the
[1:05:17] things that God's done he's he's given
[1:05:19] these things to you he's laid it on you
[1:05:25] know brother Brahm talks about writing a
[1:05:27] check
[1:05:29] you know he he said you know you
[1:05:32] he said it's a bank draft on Heaven he
[1:05:34] said you can write a check for it right

[1:05:39] but the thing is you've got to write the
[1:05:40] check
[1:05:41] but it's there

[1:05:47] favorite quote I I tell it all the time

[1:05:50] about that lady she didn't know what she
[1:05:52] had in the Bible

[1:05:56] thought she was going to have to go get
[1:05:58] help from charity and everything but
[1:06:01] everything she had neither was in her
[1:06:03] Bible but you know what somebody had to
[1:06:05] point out to her what laid in the
[1:06:06] scripture that belonged to her and then
[1:06:08] when she saw that she didn't need
[1:06:10] anything else why because it was right
[1:06:11] there
[1:06:13] and I'm so glad we've received we
[1:06:15] because God has come down in our day and
[1:06:18] in our time and he's made these things
