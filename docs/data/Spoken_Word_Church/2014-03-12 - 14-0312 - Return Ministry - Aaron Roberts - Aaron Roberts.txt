to be a little bit of a maybe an odd topic but uh you know you you wait and you know brother Dale says I don't know what I'm going to preach sometime you know you just wait and wait and wait and honestly that's the way I was I just kept waiting and I kept coming back to this one actually there was two portions of scripture and I kept trying you know just wait on the Lord to see what what he would say and maybe he'll come speak tonight yes sir we hear from him tonight brother Chris sent me a message he called me on the phone I didn't get the message but uh just got a voicemail from him

way Lord just speak to the people Lord just give them what they have need of and Lord just as the brother Brown tells the story about the dentist and always like like to use that little quote and he

whatever they have need of I don't know but you do and the word will go forth Lord you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction yes Lord Lord whatever the need

father we just pray that you'll just have your hand upon them Lord every unspoken request every uplifted hand Lord you know the needs behind them we just commit them unto you and Lord we just believe you for all things and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen um Sarah's supposed to have her her surgery the the 20th of March so you just remember her and I have no IDE I don't know what time it's supposed to be but I guess we'll be there in the morning but so uh Luke 12 starting with verse 35 and it says let your loins be GED about and your lights burning and you yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh he may they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching verily I say unto you that he shall gir himself and make them to sit to meet and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in in the second watch or in the Third Watch and find them so blessed are those ser servants and this know that if the Goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would have come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when you think not right then Peter said unto him Lord speakest thou this Parable unto us or even to all and the Lord said who then is that faithful and wise Steward who his Lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season blessed is that servant whom is Lord when he cometh shall find so doing of a truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he ha amen amen Lord bless the word you may be seated and uh yes sir appreciate it I'm like Bob I start talking and I get feels like I got a bunch of cotton in my mouth get to the point where I can't can't hardly don't feel like I can spit uh tonight I want to speak on a little thought called return Ministry and you know um you know a lot of people in the in the in the message ranks today you know there's a debate on on what's going to take place later on and you know many people have said well you know they're expecting brother brandom to come back you know they expect him to come back and and and do all these wonderful things that and you know uh we're going to put up a tent and you know he's going to speak our our body you know our body change into existence and you know he's going to speak some great word that's not been given to us yet that we've not received and that you know we're going to be able to go in the Rapture but you know you know it but but if you look in the scripture and everybody tries to take a a a type of and and look in the Bible and they try to pull some type out of the out of the scripture and try to PO you know propose a way that brother Bam's coming back but they break every type in the scripture by that you know John John came John the Baptist came and you know the and the the spirit of the Lord you know come upon him and you know he was told that you know upon whom he saw the Spirit descend like a dove and remain he said that would be the one that he was to introduce and you know you know John was standing there walking in the midst of them and you know he said right among you right now he said he said there's one who shoes I'm unworthy to unloose amen and you know you know as he was going on he said I baptize you with water but he said he'll come and baptize you with fire you know and and you know as as as time progressed and he saw the Spirit descend and when he saw the when he saw the Spirit descend Upon Jesus and when when this took place then he he you know introduced the people to the Messiah right but you know John still had followers the scripture talks about you know he still had followers that that he said I come to introduce you to this one and when he introduced them they still had their eyes on John still follow John because even brother bam talked about later on John had his eyes filmed over you know his Eagle Eye was kind of filmed over you know he couldn't see and you know he sent disciples to Jesus and asked them said are you the one or do we seek for another and brother said there in the scripture you talks about said you know he told him said you stay and wait and you see what takes place why because if the scripture doesn't speak of of what I was supposed to do you tell John what you see and he tells he said if it's not the if it's not the Fulfillment of the word then you look for for another one but if it is the Fulfillment of the word then you tell him what you seen because he knew by what the word said if the word come to pass then it was the right one and you know and then and in time as you know he come along you know John said he said I must decrease that he might increase why because he kept pointing them to the one with then when Jesus came along then he had great things to say about John he stood there and said there was none born of woman as great as John was why because John came to introduce the one that was to to fulfill God's great plan and so here he comes to to do this and you know and there was a a great move but you know that wasn't what God had en envisioned John done his part he left the scene yes sir and you know and then Jesus was to carry on and you know even today we see you know we had we've had a great ministry you know we we've had we've had the probably the greatest Ministry of of all is going through the scripture other than the Lord Jesus I believe because you know all the things that went through because as we've heard the brother Dale preaching you know speaking speaking of all the things that took place in the scripture when he speaking of the son of man you know nobody nobody else preached about the son of man except for Jesus identifying himself but then you know it came to a Time now you know he wasn't he wasn't revealed as as son of son of man but you know you know it really stood out because you know he he was always the son of man why because you know he never lost he never lost any of his uh attributes he never gained any attributes he always was the son of man and when he was all way he was the son of man all the way down through the church ages but you know what he could only be revealed as the son of God but you know it came back that he had to come back at some point in time and reveal himself as the son of man in the in this in the message the masterpieces brother R was speaking you know he was talking about in the beginning you know he was Alpha and Omega see in the beginning he was the fullness because he was he was the fullness of the word made manifest bodily and so there he was he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was the alpha he was that he was that seed that came forth that was to go into the ground and and then he was wanting it to become in a multiplied form and if it was supposed to come in a multiplied form then then he came forth and then he had then it came into reproduction and then as as it came into uh reproduction then then he then he had more of that seed but you know as as Wade brought out so wonderfully you know he was going down through the through the church ages but you know what it became in a multiplied form and it could only become in the last day that could be the fullness of godhead bodily because without them we cannot be made perfect and without us they can't be made perfect as the scripture says see we can't you know people people you know it really bugs me but you know a lot of people you know they they want to put everybody else down you know what you would never we wouldn't be where we are today if we didn't have Martin Luther if we didn't have John Wesley if we didn't have Columba and all the other ones and they stood up for what portion of light they but you know that was that was their job and you many times you know they say well this one's false and that one's false no the truth they had truth right and it became manifest right Amen Brother D was speaking of speaking of uh Revelation chapter one and he said you know he said in the you see he said John looked and you know he turned and he looked and he said he saw the golden candlesticks there said and he said he saw one standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks he said like unto the son of man and he said you know he saw that one he said and then brother Dev was bringing out how he stood in the midst of it you know and everybody's like well he should have been you know caral should have been more in the beginning than he was in the end or in the beginning or what but you know if you go to Revelation Chapter 2 the one thing that really stucked out to me was where he went to I went to in my mind he went to Revelation Chapter 2 because in Revelation Chapter 2 when it speaks of the Church of Ephesus it says that the son of he said he that walketh in the midst of the golden candlesticks so he's not just standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks but he's walking in the midst of the Gog why because the church was moving on and so he wasn't just standing there but he was walking with them he was in them and so he was moving through the church ages and so you know he was always there but he only brought forth the portion of word that he was supposed that he had for that day right and it wasn't and so so they didn't have a a they had the fullness of the word for their day and as it continued on they made it manifest amen right just as as just as as we' they've been covering the seed you know each part of that each part of that life that even even when it goes into the ground and dies you know that's a process that's part of that same life right amen it's got to go there and it's got to it's got to be buried it's got to be watered it's got to be hid amen and then it can start to come forth amen see we you know it's each one of those little pieces as it come along and and developed see that was that was the that was the life that was the word right and then it came to the fullness but that's what God had in his mind and many people have missed that right amen Y and theyve they've put it aside but I'm so glad that you know we we've had the truth in our day that we can see right I and I appreciate that because you know I I I we couldn't be where we are today if we didn't have those the forefathers that have come along and brought the word to us in in our day and you just pray for me as a I got a lot of see in a lot of different lot of different ways to go but I'm just trying to just follow the follow the lord as as we come through here but you know there I just want to see that in in our day from the from our scripture reading and and understanding what what we've seen that you know we have a brother brandham done his part and then it come time for us to do our part just as each one of each one them all down through time has done their part you know brother brandom speaks in uh in the in the church age book and you know he he says that uh the messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 he said he come to do two things right and you know those two things he said you know to turn the children the heart of the children back to the fathers and he said he said then he be he come to reveal the word he said he said through the revealing of the word he said through these Divine mystery truths he said he' literally turn their hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers so there's a there's a Time see he came and you know brother brandham said and I think it's the SE does not air with the Shu I may be wrong about that but you know brother brandom is where he said brother brother Ram said the bride would vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 re Revelation 10:7 all these scriptures that are in the scripture he said the bride would vindicate that see brother Brenham came and done his part just like the rest of them done their part and you know brother Brenham came to a certain came to his part his portion of the word but you know what that seed has not come to maturity right there's seed but you know what it's still got to come to maturity because that's what he's waiting on brother brandom says many times he said he's waiting on you and me he's waiting on us he said he said all of creation is waiting on usen he said you know brother R said the only thing that he could see that was holding off the Rapture was the Readiness of the Bride on brother so you know brother we we've we've had our part come on but you know what you can't find you can't find a type in the scripture where you you've got brother brandham coming back come on right he done his heart you know the and I maybe we'll get to some quotes later on but you know and and even when you get into U Christ the mystery you know he talks about the fullness of the word he said he come to make it plain to reveal the word to make it plain he said the word has been made known right you know he said he said he he come to equip the bride on you know in his early Ministry and I have and I have that quote brother Bram speaking of uh here it is is number three present stage of my Ministry he says because he he's speaking he said well you know all men have forsaken me he said but you know there's one thing he said I wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision that's happened down there on the river I've stayed true to it it's been true to me I'm trusting in Him someday I don't know when for a crowning of my Ministry I'll stay just as true as I could be I don't know what it'll be I don't know when it'll be but when he's ready I am now look here I hope he'll Crown my Ministry with this of letting me take the cloves of the word and dress his bride in the clothes of the word for his righteousness he said I hope he'll Crown me and let me stand there on that day and say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and you know one of the things and you know and I read things and and things stand out to me and it may stand it may stand out to you differently and that's all right I'm just I'm just going to what I what I see and what I feel what I believe and and if y'all don't like it I'm I'm sorry but you know it's just what I feel but you know what what struck me when I read this is because he says he said I come to take the bride and he said I'm taking the clothes of the word and I'm going to dress her in his righteousness and then he doesn't say that I come to see the bride on he said Behold the Lamb of God why because when she gets clothed in his righteousness and his word it's no longer looking at a bride but we're going to see him all right Hallelujah that's what we're going to see we're going to see because see it's going to be us amen him made manifest it's not going to be looking we're not be looking for a bride just as John stood there and he said you know he tried to describe the bride and he described the city and he tried to describe the city and he described the bride how many times is brother they was you know been coming back and telling us you know we are him right and what speaks of him speaks of us and here he come he said he comeing this last day and you know this is 1962 and then you know he says I'm hoping to wrap the bride dress the bride well then later on you know he speaks of he tells us that you know he the bride has received the word we received the word the the seals have been open so we've received the fullness right that's right he said he said I'm not saying that he's coming he said I'm saying that he's here am so there so there's nothing left left to be done right but he said he said that the bride would do something amen and questions and answers on the SE that's brother number five brother Joe I say I started out in a certain order and I'm bouncing around but I may get back to him I don't know question answerers on the SE I said would the would the Bride of Christ would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture he said sure he said that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ it is the message of the hour see see somebody would the would the bride have a ministry right he said the ministry is going on right now he said it's the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure see she consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble right he says now remember how many was here it goes last Sunday he said remember we skip down right here it says hum remember what I preached on humility remember when God predicts anything great to happen the people are looking so far away by their wisdom that they miss what happens when God says anything is great the world laughs at it that bunch of ignoramuses that's right but when the great world and the great High Church said boy that's marvelous God said a bunch of ignoramuses so say you have to watch I don't mean it maybe of that way exactly that way but that's the way it is so when it was when it's great it's humble exactly it'll be so humble right and that's what'll be great you know he goes on he speaks of John you know and you know everybody thought it was going to be some some great wondrous happening yeah and they thought it was some lunatic come out of the woods right and they missed him and yet he fulfilled the scripture right and they had missed him and so we see it's going to be it it's taking place right now but it'll be so humble right and you know many people people will miss it they walk right past it right as he said he said they'll just turn it downen this is uh this is a quote from works as Faith expressed this is number one brother Joe he said just seeds has have to the ground prepared first therefore he said all he for knew he called all he called he for knew he predestinated if you want to read that Ro it's Romans 82834 also Ephesians 1-5 see all he forew he did call all he called he justified and all he justified he is already glorified he said there's nothing out of order we went there we think there is but look in the scripture it's just hitting exactly the way God's word said it would that's right we see the message is rejected today isn't that just what the scriptures said they would do sure all these things are ordained of God he said oh it should make you walk happy that's the trouble with we today so much differ than the Christians of old when the real true revelation of Jesus Christ being Emanuel dwell in the hearts of those men they were rugged people but today we're patted by denominations with oh I tell you they ain't got the Revelation come over here you come over here and you know that's the way it is today right right and I was listening listening the way other Wednesday and you know he said something that was very striking and you know he said he said you wait he said Satan will put somebody in this message he said the people are going to flock after oh and you know you know just to tell you wait and now we're Somewhere listening to someone speak and you know they told us they told us said if somebody come and started doing the had a Ministry like brother BR they'd have to follow it they would be following that and they would just but what but it's not it's not the great signs and wonders and miracles I said you know because Satan Satan can impersonate all of that but what but what is he what is he saying what is he bringing forth what is what is the message because that's what that's what is the most important because people have missed that right amen and you know you you see all the way through the through the minist through the message today through the ministry right right all around all around the message and you know I was thinking today that you know there was a there was a time there was a time in this message that the things that the things that have that have taken place the things that people do and the things that people say around this message said you know they they would prefer you to have their their tongue cut out than for them to say these things right and now they say them without with Reckless abandon they don't even they don't even care you know it it struck me you know white was speaking of of the you know the man said I wish brother venam hadn't said that yeah you know I mean it's mindboggling right I mean there was there was a time that that if you come up there and and said anything contrary sometimes even halfway contrary to what brother Bram said they don't want to fight you excuse me right and now and now they say well I don't know and then they've come along and you know you you wonder if people even believe even believe the message anymore right you know because we've seen in in the ministers meetings when you know you you have these people and you know they bring up they bring up topics and it's like is is there really any need to bring these things up and discuss them you know the things the way the the way a Christian should should conduct their life should you know it let lays in black and white right amen and if it and if it lays in black and white you know that's all you have to do is read it it doesn't it doesn't need to be discussed it doesn't need but see that that's you know that's the way they do it they come in and then they're going to cut away here and cut away there you know people people have taken the message and then you know they they say well you know this part of it was brother R was speaking to the Pentecostals and this this was for this group over here and this is for this group over here and by the time they putting putting portions of the message out over the pl all over the place guess what there's no message for them why because they' done away with it that's right and you know because if if you know the only person that I know of that was Vindicated was the prophet there was nobody else Vindicated right I I sure I certainly wasn't Vindicated and you know how can I take take my and put my own try to put my own interpret ation to it but I mean if it's in black and white then then why is it that you know you come up with these you know these silly doctrines and you you go through the message and you know they just pile up oh yeah yeah and and it's and it's very sad to see but you know people you know they want to know what you believe well if if I can find it in black and white and and that's all I have to do is take what he said why because you know he's obligated to reveal the word to us I can say well Lord you you've said it and I'm just going to hold on to it because you said a real true Eagle would understand right come on so I'm just going to hold on but see the thing is is if we try to put our own interpretation to it and we find some portion of the word over here that says one thing and this portion over here says something different and it looks totally different and it looks like it's you know conflicting each other and you know it's it's cont contradicting each other and it's like well you know we're just going to decide which part that we want to deal with we want to take this one over here we want to take that one over there or you know we want to take what brother bandom said after the seals and everything else was just you know goes by the wayside yeah and you know they've laid it all aside but you know I think you can take what he said all the way back to 1947 and it dovet tales with what he said in 6 five It lines up perfectly but the thing is it takes the Holy Ghost to do that and it doesn't it doesn't take me it doesn't take anybody else but the thing is is you know we need to sit and wait on him to come and speak the word to us and then he'll make it known but see the thing is is we' we've tried to put as he says you know they rejected the message they've put him on the outside right and it's supposed to be it's supposed to be the message but you know what we've got more denominations in the message and you know as he sat here and work in this in this quote you know he said you know he said but we're padded by denominations oh I tell you they ain't got the Revelation you come over here yeah oh yeah you know they they've got all kinds of groups and you know they they lay this aside and lay that aside and you know that's the reason that's the reason that the things that take place and you know I was speaking to a brother years ago and you know he he told me something he said he said you watch a a church he said when When sin takes place in the congregation and he said it's not called out right and he said it's not dealt with he said when the pastor Gets behind the pull pit and he and he just goes condones it and he doesn't say anything he said you watch what that preacher starts preaching he said the next thing you know it's false Doctrine yeah he said why because when you give when you give Satan a foothold then he'll take over amen and see that's the reason that's the reason that brother random said you know it was it's so important see a pastor job is such a serious position why because he's got to call this out he's got to come in and and straighten these things out and don't wonder brother said you know people people don't want the gifts yeah because you know if if the gifts were put in the body to keep it clean they sure don't want to do that because they sure don't want to deal with it because they just want to they just want to play Church they just want to pet these little their little Devils these little doctrines that's right and you know and then we got other people that you know they don't even study enough to know they've not even they don't even stay and they just sink they just swallow everything hookline and sinker you know and I understand where Brother D was coming from you know he said you know he just he didn't he didn't want to go out there and try to preach to anybody he didn't want to go out and try to try to tell anybody he said just going to be right here he preach if they want to see it then they're welcome to it but you know then then they they can make their own choice right but the word has been made known amen the word has been revealed yes see we've received the word right that's the reason that's the reason I say that I'm so blessed because what we've received here and at this church what we've received here because you know it is so it's so wonderful righta because that's that's that's what is I have a desire for to see more of God to see what God has brought to us that we can see these things this is from try to get through is your life worthy of the Gospel brother R was speaking this is number two brother Joe said now Jesus here is saying he said man has always tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation he said though it be firmly proven to them that it's his supper and his invitation but man is constantly making excuses he said and if you read St Matthew 22 you'll find out the excuses were made there also he said it went back into all ages went back into the age and he said a man bid them and had a Vineyard we find that ver that Parable and how he sent his servants to collect from his his Vineyard he said first servant come what they do they run him off the next servant come they also stoned him and they run servant after servant the cruel man the king sent finally his son and when his son come he found we found out that they said this is an heir we'll kill him then we'll have all things Jesus said unto them the king sent forth and slew those murderers and burnt their City he said now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something to receive the invitation that he's given and he turns it down there's nothing left after Mercy right is spurn but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that is Judgment we find out that man has done that in all ages as happened in most every age in the Bible so that's what has happened he's made made he's made the invitation man has received this invitation but as he said they've not wanted to receive it but it's been made known am so you know as as brother Brandon was saying you know God has made it known and he's given everybody this opportunity right and you know all you have to do is turn down one portion of the word it's not it's not the ones that have not heard it's not the ones that have been bound by false Doctrine but it's the ones that have heard the real truth right and they've turned it down he said then they've received judgment that's that's that's where they've come to but you know we have received the word and it is up to us whether what we're going to do with it we have to make that decision that's right but you know I thank God that we've received this word it's been taught to us we it's it's come in its fullness and you know there's there's many things that as brother Dale was speaking you know it it's com into this fullness and you know to see who we are and to see what God has done you know because if if we can see what what we've received brother brandom said and I can't see if I can find the quote but you know he said you have to know you has to know you have to know who you are and what you're doing exactly I was going to see I can't find but you know he said you you've got to know who you are and what you're doing you've got to you've got to know the word and if you don't know the word you don't know what you're going to be doing but you know we received this word and you know brother Rand was speaking in in in Christ the mystery and you know he's speaking of this message coming and you know the the fullness coming to the bride the fullness coming and then you know he said as as we see through the scripture he said all that God was he poured into Christ and you you know then we see that he said all that that Christ was he poured into the church he said he poured into the bride but you know brother goes on to say there in Christ the mystery and and a couple other quotes he goes on and you know he says all that God was he poured into the believer right and and proof of his resurrection he said all that God was he poured it's number eight brother Joe all that God all that was in God was poured out in Christ and all that was in Christ was emptied out into the believer the church God is with you Lord I'm with thee always even to the end of the world that's the direct Declaration of God's word that's what the Bible says that's what I believe and in number nine Jehovah Gyra 1964 I love this one everything that was in God God poured into Christ everything that was in Christ he poured into the to the believer God above us God With Us and God in us everything every promise in the book is yours if you believe it if you have faith enough to accept it and believe it amen exactly because you know he's he's poured it out to us and you know I've been working on I've been working on air compressors at work and trying to trying to do some trying to put some valves and everything in it and you know air one there's giant air compressors you know they have automatic U blow down valves that the when uh you know when you compress air you build up moisture build up water yeah the valves in it you know they dump all the water out of them well I'm I'm the one dumping all the water out of them and you know you just and and so you know when you get to a part A P uh when you start emptying those compressors out you know they get to a a a place that when they're dumping all the water out you just get water and you get water and you get water and then the P there's a at get toward the end when you get you get no more water you get a bath because the air blows out and it blows all the water all over you but you know that's what you know I was thinking that you know he's pouring it out right you know he said all that God was he poured out he's poured out he's poured into us and you know you see when you think of water as as being poured out and you know you just think well that can't be anymore and it just it just goes and goes and goes and when you're filling up five gallon buckets you don't think it's ever going to end but it's just more and more and more and you know that's the way God is because you think well you've reached the end and there's no there's more and there's more and there's more exactly see you you know as as Brother D was speaking of one time and you know he was speaking on uh multiplying and and dividing of God you know as reproducing and and dividing of God you know when you when you get one portion of God you know it it's infinite in it's in its ability and and because it has everything that is of god in that one portion because in that in you know because you received it by measure but that one part that you've received has has everything that of God in it that's right and so you know you received it but you know what it's infinite it's infinitees in its power and all that it can do you know because you know brother Dale was speaking of you know and the only way I I see it is you know I see numbers and you know when you get in when you get in you start talking about Infinity yeah and you know when you see that one part you can take you can say you know you just take you know always ask people how many numbers are there between the numbers of one and two and some people say none like well one and a half don't exist one and a quarter don't exist well how many numbers are there there's an infinite set of numbers there yeah see we don't we don't recognize the numbers that are there because we just look at because we limit those that said we limit that well we say there's nothing there but see brother Bon was trying to get us to see that there's unlimited amount there right you know brother Bram said if if we could we could see what what uh Einstein you know if Einstein take the word and what Einstein could see and put it together you know he could really told us something you know and and you know brother V was standing there and he said he said God he said feels all time and space he feels everything and we look out there in the night sky and we s we say we don't see anything we just see nothingness we see galaxies and stars and all these things we see nothing but you know here come Einstein to tell us you know he's you know all there's something out there he said you know we we were looking and we thought that light the light that was bending and you know we thought all that was taking place because of gravitational pull and then Einstein proved that it wasn't pull it was pushing he said something was out there pushing what was it there's an unknown Force that's out there that's causing these things to take place see we didn't see that but he said you know that's what he was trying to get us to see he said he said if you could see tonight the angels in the building right you know brother BR said one time he said they're standing all around the walls he said said if you could see in that other dimension he said he said because the angel of God encampeth about those that fear him so he's always there but if you could see that amen see we look and we think there's nothing there but you know as as Elisha said to Gesa he said you know there's more with us than there are with them but you know what he had to be able to S into that other dimension that other realm to see what was taking place and there's more opening up to us it's it's greater here than anywhere than any time in history right why because brother mam said it would be humble and people would just walk right over walk right past it they would miss it but it's here yes right that's what God has wanted us to see if we can see this unseen unseen realm that's facing us I'm GNA get to we'll get to a few other things and I'm GNA finish but you know we were reading the quote here and I I put this this the scripture in it's Matthew 21 and I was going to going to read this but you know it's where he was talking of the of the vineyard and he was talking of the husbandman and you know they they came and you know he said he he lent out his Vineyard to the to the husbandman and you know brother bandham said that the husbandman in the in the in the the message brother R always talks about the husbandman being the ministry being the ministers being the preachers and he said you know he landed out this Vineyard for them to bring forth seed to cultivate this he had it all set up for him but you know what when it came time for it to produce seed in the time of the fruit right it come time for the fruit to come forth he said then you saw what they were doing right he said brother R said they were fighting and backbiting against each other he said he said they were going against it and he said he sent his servants to them and he said they killed one and they killed another threw them out right but you know the but the but the the master said well this is my son I'm going to send my son to him he said they'll reference my son oh yeah you know what he got the worst end of the deal because they said this is the air we're really going to get him amen and what did he say he said what what will happen to these he said it' utterly destroy them and see that's that's what I've seen that's what I see in happened in the message right see it's it's a glorious time but I've seen where where theyve take they've taken this message that's right and they've taken each one of the and you look at these servants you know I see I see Martin Luther Martin Luther's faults we don't we don't need the message of justification anymore he changed brother ad changed the doctrine of the new birth we don't need sanctification anymore all we got to do is get the Holy Ghost we thrown them out and then when Christ the word came see they thrown out each one of the servants sure and then all of a sudden brother bam didn't know what he was talking about you think you'd think you'd get that from the Pentecostals or from the denominations or what whatever but you know what you get more Skeptics and more unbelievers and more critics that people that claim to believe this message and those are those are the ones that have fought against all this and you know we we thought it was an amazing thing when people started saying the things against brother brandham that was the tip of the iceberg absolutely because now they've gotten to the place where they're destroying the word right right just just as the this the master sent his sent his son he said surely they'll reverence him no it was worse and it's exactly what they've done today they they've attacked they've attacked the word right and destroyed and destroyed the the effect of the word and you know I'm amazed that that that people can go to play you know certain churches and and you know I don't I don't mean to be critical but you know I I you just got to call things what they are right and you know because people are going to going to do their own thing and you know whatever it is it's it's you know because of of money or because of of of popular you know popularity or whatever it is that you know that they have decided to do but you know you know brother random said he said I indict this generation for for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ you know what that indictment still stands and you know what that indictment is still upon the people and it's even worse today upon the people of this message because they've turned it down right right and you know I I I stand here today and I tell you and I'll be the first one to admit it I'm not I'm not I'm not the most perfect I'm not the right you know there's a lot of things in me that aren't right but God help me stand to stand and and and defend this amen whether I die and go to hell there's one thing about it this word's right I may not I may not be I may not be right in all the things that I do and that's all right there ain't nobody there nobody in this building is going to have to answer for me but me and yeah I know I'm I know I'm not where I ought to be but you know what I want to say one thing I believe I'm not where I used to be and that that's one thing that I can that I can say but you know you you've seen what what the word has come forth we've received the we' received the word in its fullness and you know what it's been trampled underfoot and all the things that has happened to it but you may tell you I'm so glad that it's been shown to me amen if I you know I I told people if I die and go to hell at least I stand up and say thank God I've seen what I saw God has shown me this I may not I may not be able to explain it and I may not be able to expound on it as well as other people but you know there's one thing about it I believe I got faith in it I believe it'll do what it says it'll do and God will do what he says he'll do amen why because when when you don't see a way out sometimes and you wonder how things are going to take place God comes on the scene amen you know when you when you take a when you take an inventory of your life sometimes and you look where you are and where you used to be you know what you can stand up and say thank God I'm not there I may have a long way to go but you know what I think I've come somewhere amen I've come I've and and I know I'm not where I need to be but I thank God I'm not where I used to be but see the thing is as long as as long as you're not as Wade said you know as long as you're not standing still or going backwards because that's what we need to do we need to go forward glory and so I thank God for what he's shown me amen and I just want to share a few other things and I'm I'm GNA finish up here but I was reading the other day in the mess of deep call to the Deep brother R was speaking of he was speaking of uh Benjamin Franklin and he was talking about Benjamin Franklin understanding about light and electricity and you know he said he went out there and he flew that kite and he had the key on the end of it you know and he and he realized he had there was power there and you know he he found out there was power he said you know electricity lightning was actually electricity was able to find out understand that you know brother R said he stood there and he said I got it I got it it yeah he had he had that but you know what he didn't go any further with it but you know you had somebody that was uh moving further beyond that and he said his name was Thomas Edison and Edison came along and he said you know Edison got in a in a lab and he sat down and you know he said he wanted to harness that he wanted to be able to use that he wanted to understand more about it then then Ben Franklin just standing there saying I got it and you know he got in there and he wanted to build a life bulb and you know he wanted to stand there and you know and he got in a lab and and if you if you ever read anything about Edison Edison hated Edison hated doing uh book work he had you know and you know lots of times when you go to do lab work you're doing experiments you know you do a lot of studying and writing and all this type stuff you know they said you know he made 10,000 experiments trying to build a light bulb well you know you know he he didn't want to sit down and try to write it out and know there was one of the things that he detested was people come and tell him said well this won't work and they had it on paper he said well have you proved it you know that was that was Edison's way of doing it don't tell me what what it says can you prove it has it been proven and you know you know because so he got in there and that's what he done he kept trying something else and that didn't work but you know he never got deterred by what what took place he tried something else he tried something else but you know what he was able to come a place and develop something that actually worked exactly because nobody had to tell him well that won't work he figured out woodw right and you know there was a there was a man that and some of y'all may may have never heard of him before and I don't think brother V ever mentions him but I don't think you some of you may have never heard of Nicola Tesla was his name some of you probably have yeah that's right you know Tesla worked he was from uh I think he was from Hungary and uh he come he come and worked under Edison for a while you know Tesla said you know he said I could have he said I could have sto 90% of the lab work that Edison done because I could have proved it but Edison wasn't that way don't tell me what you can write down tell me what you can prove right but you know Tesla took the things the same things that Edison had you know Edison spent all his time building a light bulb well that was good but I tell you what we wouldn't be where we are today if it wasn't from Tesla you know Tesla said I think it was in the early 1900s Tesla said that told us at one of these days he said a person will be holding an object a device of some sort and he said they'll be communicating with someone else over here you can send your message to this person over there they'll receive it and send it back to you he had a he had a light B he had a light fixture a street light out in front of his laboratory there were no wires connected to that light it came on was powered turned on and off by the source that was in his lab amen he dealt with he understood Wireless you know he he told us that that everything we could communicate by without wires and you know he developed all kinds of things today there was a lot of things that that we we have seen because you know he stepped in and Edison could talk about building a light bulb and having electricity but you know Ed Tesla come along like he said he built AC showed us how how this would develop in and you know how we could communicate wirelessly and someone come along and and showed us today and you know all of us have cell phones you know he he went beyond that but you know people thought this man was a lunatic do you know do you know because of of the the ideas and the thoughts that Tesla had and the and the things that he wrote about and talked about do you know that's where we get the stereotype of the mad scientist yeah right why because here you know you know people people don't have lights and you know all these type things and here he is talking about things that just blowing people mind and you know what we walked right into it you know brother said he said Electric's been here this whole time right but you know what they've been able to find people that that have looked into that realm and been able to harness it that we can that we can see it and it's the same thing with the word of God it's been here the whole time but you know what now you can harness the power of it now you can reach into that you can see the things that are there and you can you know you can walk along and say well this doesn't this doesn't exist like brother talking about the man you know climb down in the basement and say well the sun doesn't come up that's not going to change God's plan you can either receive it or you can turn it down but you know what it's still going to be there and many people have turned it down they've walked away many people are scared of it that's true but you know what we need to come back to an oldfashioned altar amen come back to the beginning right and like like many many of people have said the reason people don't grow is because they never got born again that's right and if you never if you never got born again then you can't ever grow things don't ever change but you know what God is still in the saving business he's still here to meet each need and and make hisself known right let's all stand but I'm so glad that he has made himself known to us there is a there is a a Ministry I'm not I'm not looking for brother brandham to come back right I'm not looking for brother brandom to come back and and bring me anything I believe he's done his part am sir I believe I believe we've seen the revelation of Jesus Christ in our midst this bride has a Ministry and I believe we've heard from that five-fold Ministry and now the word is made known to us and then it's our our decision what we're going to do with it whether we accept or rejected right how far because you know he said it go it's for whosoever will well then you can say well is that me or not so I'm so thankful amen God help me to walk in the light as he is in the light Glory As He makes himself known to us we walk in that word right amen amen God bless you 38 in the spiral book draw me near Lord I am thine oh Lord I love to me but I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to the draw me near nearer blessed
