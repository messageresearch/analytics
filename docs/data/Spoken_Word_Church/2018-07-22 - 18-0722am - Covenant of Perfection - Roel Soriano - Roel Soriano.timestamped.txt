[0:27] Psalm 48 no I was thinking two guys in
[0:35] the boxing ring fighting the winner in
[0:40] or desired blooded you know us and his
[0:43] reels all out of place but he's the
[0:47] winner we should look at think about
[0:50] Jesus Christ it already paid the price
[0:53] for what we have even if we asked and we
[0:58] think we don't feel nothing we don't
[1:01] receive nothing we still are winners
[1:03] we're still a victorious because Jesus
[1:06] Christ has already paid the price so
[1:08] however you feel just remember that he's
[1:12] already paid for and all all healings
[1:18] are not miracles but their healings

[9:40] money towards motorcycles that we are
[9:43] now using to reach distant places in the
[9:49] Philippines one of them went to some

[10:37] have fellowship with some friends from
[10:39] the Philippines and then we would

[10:47] church there in Oregon and then we will
[10:51] be back door billing in this area for
[10:54] the route meetings the first week of

[11:00] more time to fellowship be together and
[11:03] we bring greetings from our church in
[11:07] Thai Thai and also other churches in
[11:11] Metro Manila that are in fellowship
[11:13] together okay today I just thought of
[11:24] presenting something that in my humble
[11:28] understanding simple way of assessing
[11:35] the mess aids Lord meaning I'd be able
[11:40] to communicate this to the brothers and
[11:43] sisters you know I'm not the dynamic
[11:48] picture but I love the word you know and
[11:56] I prepared a a PowerPoint presentation
[11:59] to assist me in doing this I'm going to
[12:06] speak on the subject which I call
[12:12] covenant of perfection see God he likes
[12:19] to make covenant with his people
[12:23] he made a covenant with Adam he said if
[12:28] you do this I will do this you obey my
[12:32] word I will bless you reject my word
[12:36] disobey my word then curse will come
[12:42] and God has always been faithful to his
[12:46] covenant but man has always failed you
[12:52] Adam fail and then Noah failed again
[12:56] because God said if you do this then
[13:00] I'll do this but then he made an
[13:06] unconditional covenant with Abraham and
[13:11] that's what we're gonna talk about this
[13:15] morning the Covenant of perfection God
[13:21] made a covenant with his people so that
[13:24] they can all come to perfection
[13:27] amen and when he made the covenant to
[13:31] Abraham it was no longer if you do this
[13:35] I'll do this it was settled forever
[13:38] there was no condition he said I'm gonna
[13:42] bless you period
[13:45] hallelujah the subtitle of this sermon
[13:52] is called perfect Liberty in the perfect
[13:55] will of God hallelujah let me show this
[13:59] slide slides of the Statue of a perfect
[14:03] man okay we're all familiar with the
[14:11] with this diagram that Batman made of
[14:14] the statue of a perfect man really this
[14:18] is the fullness of Christ the structure
[14:20] of a perfect man is is the measure of
[14:24] Christ these are all attributes of
[14:30] Christ amen and we'll go to the our
[14:40] scriptures in Genesis chapter 12 verse 2
[14:43] and 3 were God made the covenant with
[14:46] Abraham and if you would please stand
[14:50] with me as we read the word of God
[14:58] verse two says and I will make of thee a
[15:02] great nation
[15:04] remember no conditions I will make of
[15:07] thee a great nation I will bless thee
[15:09] and make mine make thy name great and
[15:14] thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[15:18] bless them that bless thee and curse
[15:20] them that curse thee and in thee shall
[15:23] all families of the earth be blessed
[15:26] this is not just a blessing to Abraham
[15:30] but is also a blessing to his seed so
[15:34] God made a covenant to Abraham and his
[15:37] seed
[15:38] let us all pray Heavenly Father we come
[15:42] humbly before your feet this morning
[15:45] because our human understanding are
[15:48] limited and we cannot there's no way we
[15:51] can grasp the spiritual meanings of this
[15:56] scriptures that be of bread this morning
[15:58] unless you come down and help us we pray
[16:02] father that the Holy Ghost the Eagle
[16:04] anointing come down upon the picture and
[16:07] this hearer alike and may give us a
[16:11] wonderful time together as we look at
[16:14] the Word of God and see our place our
[16:17] proper place in your word we thank you
[16:20] and give you the glory and honor in the
[16:23] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen may be
[16:26] seated
[16:29] hallelujah I also have a request for a
[16:34] dear friend in that lives in Arizona
[16:37] originally from the Philippines sister
[16:39] Maryland Gabrielle she was diagnosed to
[16:43] have third-degree cancer and was
[16:50] operated on and is actually recuperating
[16:54] in her home so I just ask that you pray
[16:59] with us for
[17:00] her complete recovery okay now better
[17:10] Branum tried to explain this
[17:15] unconditional covenant that God made
[17:18] with Abraham and he said the next slide
[17:21] he said now he's making the Abrahamic
[17:25] covenant and the Abrahamic covenant
[17:29] according to Genesis a table chapter it
[17:32] was given unconditionally
[17:36] therefore it is eternal oh man I'm glad
[17:41] that we we are in an eternal covenant
[17:44] with God because it is unconditional not
[17:51] if you will I will like the previous
[17:56] covenants made with men Adam and Noah
[17:59] and so forth he said I have I have
[18:02] already done it not I will do it but I
[18:07] have done it past tense
[18:09] that's oh that that that basis faith
[18:14] this should be the basis of our faith
[18:18] hallelujah
[18:19] see not God he said God is determined to
[18:24] save man hallelujah
[18:27] so if God determines to Deus to do
[18:31] something you know nothing can stop him
[18:34] from doing it hallelujah because God is
[18:37] determined to save man he make a
[18:41] covenant he make a covenant if you will
[18:45] are real he would break it man would
[18:47] break it another one you will I will he
[18:50] broke it man can keep his covenant
[18:53] so God saves man by his grace aren't you
[18:59] thankful for the grace of God hallelujah
[19:02] God saves man not by law but by his
[19:08] grace under a covenant that's
[19:11] unconditional unconditional covenant
[19:15] hallelu he said this in you have a gyro
[19:18] number one okay now we go to 2nd Peter
[19:26] chapter 1 verse 3 to 5 we're all
[19:32] familiar with the scripture this is spur
[19:34] butter Benham got the diagram of stature
[19:38] of a perfect man I want to read from
[19:42] verse 3 and want to emphasize some
[19:45] things here Bible says according as his
[19:49] divine power has given unto us all
[19:53] things we're talking about divine power
[19:57] here and this divine power the power of
[20:02] God has already given to us all things
[20:07] 2nd Peter is stated in past tense
[20:12] according as his divine power has given
[20:16] unto us all things that pertain unto
[20:19] life and godliness through the knowledge
[20:22] of him that has called us to glory and
[20:25] virtue whereby are given did you know
[20:29] this past tense again whereby are given
[20:33] unto us exceeding in great and precious
[20:35] promises that by these you might be
[20:39] partakers of the divine nature having
[20:43] escaped you notice that is past tense
[20:46] all past tense having escaped the
[20:49] corruption that is in the world through
[20:52] loss and then John started enumerated
[20:58] all the videos virtuous Peter I should
[21:00] say started numerating all the virtues
[21:03] and beside this giving all diligence add
[21:05] to your faith virtue and to virtue
[21:07] analysis and so forth until we reach the
[21:12] final lather
[21:16] of charity in the stature of a perfect
[21:20] man
[21:23] you know sometimes because of the way
[21:26] it's written sometimes I think the
[21:31] believers they think it's their effort
[21:40] that brings the virtuous in because the
[21:44] way it's written add to your faith
[21:47] virtue and add to your virtue knowledge
[21:49] it's like we should be the ones adding
[21:53] to it you know but if if you think about
[21:57] it the very first virtue mentioned here
[22:00] is faith number one how can you add
[22:05] faith faith did not come from you
[22:10] faith is not a product of your effort
[22:14] brother Branham says a very powerful
[22:18] statement but BAM says faith is a
[22:20] revelation faith is something that God
[22:25] God gives to you freely hallelujah you
[22:30] don't have to work for it it's a free
[22:34] gift from God hallelujah that's why when
[22:41] the Bible says add to your faith virtue
[22:46] knowledge and so on
[22:48] it doesn't mean you do the working right
[22:51] or your making the effort to add this
[22:55] virtuous to your life it's simply saying
[22:58] that added to your faith which is a gift
[23:02] of God apart from faith there are more
[23:07] God gave us more hallelujah and this is
[23:12] a part of the what we call divine nature
[23:17] the Bible calls it divine nature meaning
[23:25] your effort has nothing to do with it
[23:28] you know you just become partakers of
[23:31] this divine nature
[23:33] it's like Berta Bram said you know a
[23:37] sheep doesn't make an effort to produce
[23:40] war it's his nature to produce more in
[23:48] the same way you know we don't produce
[23:50] pay but the god that lives inside of us
[23:57] is the one that produces it and God is
[24:01] the one that adds virtue to it and all
[24:05] the other attributes are characteristics
[24:11] that are mentioned in 2nd Peter it's God
[24:14] that adds to it our efforts have nothing
[24:18] to do with it
[24:19] even we just believed the promise of God
[24:23] hallelujah God made a covenant he made a
[24:26] promise a covenant is a promise right
[24:28] he's always faithful to the promise and
[24:31] all we need to do is to believe his
[24:34] promise hallelujah by faith and he will
[24:39] fulfill his part of the Covenant part of
[24:42] the contract hallelujah he also made a
[24:47] covenant in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25
[24:51] to 27 with the church he was not only
[24:57] determined to save man he was also
[25:00] determined for man to come to perfection
[25:09] for his church to come to perfection
[25:12] efficient chapter 5 verse 25 to 27 says
[25:16] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[25:20] also loved the church and gave himself
[25:23] for it that he might sanctify and
[25:27] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[25:30] the word
[25:32] God has determined predetermined in his
[25:35] mind to cleanse his church wash it clean
[25:39] by the washing of the water of the word
[25:41] that he might present it unto himself
[25:44] what kind of church a glorious church
[25:46] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[25:50] thing but that it should be holy and
[25:53] without blemish in other words so that
[25:57] the church can be perfect blameless not
[26:04] a spot huh hallelujah not a sin
[26:07] hallelujah but it's a spotless church
[26:13] and in the Book of Revelations we see
[26:16] the bride singing a new song revelations
[26:19] chapter five and it's the sum of the
[26:22] redeemed we read endless and they sung a
[26:27] new song saying thou art worthy to take
[26:30] the book and to open the seals thereof
[26:32] but thou was slain and has redeemed us
[26:35] to God by thy blood out of every kindred
[26:39] and tongue and people and nation and has
[26:42] made us unto our God kings and priests
[26:46] and we shall reign on the earth I say a
[26:48] mentalist Amen so the bride is
[26:52] proclaiming in the book of Revelation
[26:55] that she has already been redeemed
[26:59] hallelujah how are we redeemed we are
[27:03] redeemed by the precious blood of the
[27:05] Lamb hallelujah now we understand that
[27:16] the firstborn in the Old Testament they
[27:19] all belong to God firstborn of animals
[27:24] they belong to God the first harvest
[27:26] belong to God firstborn among human
[27:30] beings belong to God in Exodus chapter
[27:32] 34 verse 20 this is what the Bible says
[27:36] but the first thing of an ass thou shalt
[27:39] be deal with a lamb and if thou redeem
[27:43] him not then shalt thou gray
[27:46] his neck all the firstborn of thy sons
[27:49] thou shalt redeem and none shall appear
[27:53] before me
[27:54] empty hallelujah
[27:59] the Bible is telling us all the
[28:02] firstborn belong to God you cannot take
[28:08] it for yourself
[28:12] firstling of an animal you cannot sell
[28:15] it and use the money for your family for
[28:20] your own needs our firstborn belongs to
[28:24] me God says that's why if you have a
[28:29] donkey that's firstborn the Bible says
[28:34] you helped to redeem it with a lamb you
[28:38] can't sell it you can't use the proceeds
[28:40] of it you can't even use it to in
[28:47] farming and then till in your land you
[28:50] can't use it and use it for anything it
[28:53] belongs to God
[28:55] and you have to redeem it how with a
[29:02] lamb and it has to be a perfect lamb
[29:09] hallelujah
[29:11] so you see maybe the donkey has certain
[29:15] imperfections about it maybe the eyes
[29:20] are crossed a little bit and the ears
[29:22] are sticking out and and the legs are
[29:26] bent you know and there's some scubs
[29:28] here and there
[29:29] hallelujah and the donkey thinks surely
[29:38] they will break my neck I'm dead because
[29:42] of all all the imperfections that I've
[29:46] got you know I'll be dead they'll break
[29:49] my neck but the Bible said it has to be
[29:55] within with the land
[29:58] all the imperfections of the donkey will
[30:03] not be seen because God will look at the
[30:08] perfect at the perfection of the land
[30:11] the perfect land hallelujah he will not
[30:14] even look at the imperfection of the
[30:17] donkey he looks at the perfection of the
[30:20] land
[30:21] hallelujah that's why in Romans chapter
[30:24] 8 verse 29 it says for whom he did
[30:29] foreknow he also did predestinate to be
[30:35] conformed to the image of his son this
[30:40] was the message yesterday I've truly
[30:43] thoroughly enjoyed it
[30:44] we have been conformed to the image of
[30:48] his son that he might become he might be
[30:52] the firstborn among many brethren if
[30:56] you've been born again into the body of
[30:59] Christ by the Spirit of God then you
[31:02] become a firstborn if you are in Christ
[31:06] you are a firstborn considered a
[31:10] firstborn hallelujah but the dáil here
[31:15] is my elder but if you think about rank
[31:22] in the body of Christ in the family of
[31:24] God
[31:25] we are both firstborn it's not older in
[31:30] me because in the mind of God
[31:33] we were Berthoud amen so everyone that's
[31:38] been predestinated in the mind of God
[31:40] and that has experienced this rebirth
[31:44] God looks at you as a firstborn child
[31:48] amen
[31:50] because we are in Christ and you know
[31:53] that there are many benefits to our
[31:55] firstborn child in the Old Testament the
[32:00] usefully receive a double portion of
[32:03] everything and remember the story of
[32:08] Esau and Jacob
[32:11] Esau's birthright being the firstborn he
[32:15] sold it to Jacob and that's why Jacob
[32:20] took the birthright and he had to come
[32:24] back to his motherland to claim his in
[32:29] his inheritance and his birthright
[32:35] hallelujah okay so being firstborn we
[32:43] have to be redeemed by the land
[32:48] hallelujah
[32:49] and that's that's what Christ did for
[32:52] all of us
[32:53] he will deemed us by his blood on
[32:56] Calvary in the book of Hebrews but mom
[33:00] says this I said God looks at Christ not
[33:06] you and it's Christ that God looks at
[33:13] not you it's Christ so if there is no
[33:19] fault in him how can there be fall we're
[33:26] thinking of our imperfections we're
[33:29] thinking about weaknesses of our little
[33:32] sins that we commit every day every
[33:35] single day hallelujah but God doesn't
[33:38] look at it God doesn't look at our
[33:42] little imperfections because he looks at
[33:46] Christ not you and if there's no fault
[33:51] in him how can there be fall
[33:53] how can he find fault when you are dead
[33:56] and your life is hid in Christ through
[33:59] God sealed by the Holy Ghost they that
[34:03] are born of God does not commit sin oh
[34:06] my hallelujah
[34:14] I hope you can identify with this they
[34:18] that are born of God does not commit sin
[34:21] we're not talking about the sins that
[34:24] you've confessed before piety or
[34:26] conversion but it's the day-to-day
[34:30] failings that we commit hallelujah
[34:34] after working that's converted after we
[34:38] become Christians and even message
[34:41] believers we continue to commit mistakes
[34:45] hallelujah
[34:48] how can he seen when a perfect sacrifice
[34:52] is laying in his place
[34:54] God never looks at me he looks at Christ
[34:59] because we are in Christ hallelujah amen
[35:04] oh my aren't you happy that God is not
[35:09] looking at your weaknesses God is not
[35:12] looking at the sins that you continually
[35:15] commit in this life even after your
[35:18] conversion hallelujah you see when a man
[35:23] is converted two things can happen
[35:26] everyone says the next slide in the next
[35:30] slide but about said now on this side
[35:34] when people get converted their mind is
[35:38] set right on Christ and if they're just
[35:42] a little scholarly and don't keep under
[35:45] prayer they will get real cold and stiff
[35:49] and starchy and indifferent and then if
[35:55] they're just a little bit nervous if you
[35:57] don't watch they'll just get radical and
[36:00] wild on this side see they go to
[36:04] sensations and everything fanaticism but
[36:10] then I like what Bertrand said about the
[36:12] church but now the real church is a real
[36:16] same gospel right in the middle of the
[36:21] road it's not cold and starchy neither
[36:24] is it fanaticism it's a real good old
[36:29] warm gospel heartfelt love of God going
[36:35] right down the middle of the road
[36:38] calling from both sides from both
[36:41] extremes right in the middle of the road
[36:45] that's right now
[36:47] and how are you going to get that church
[36:49] is there such a chance how are you going
[36:53] to get the church right out of the word
[36:56] there Urim and Thummim hallelujah amen
[37:01] first first Peter chapter 1 verse 18 and
[37:03] 19 the Bible says for as Masashi know
[37:07] that you were not redeemed with
[37:09] corruptible things a silver and gold
[37:13] from your vain conversation received by
[37:16] tradition from your father's but with
[37:19] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[37:22] lamb without blemish and without spot
[37:24] see this takes us all the way to Exodus
[37:28] the scripture that we read that because
[37:31] you're a firstborn that you needed to be
[37:33] redeemed by a lamb hallelujah so Christ
[37:36] became our lamb without blemish and
[37:40] without spot hallelujah that's why God
[37:47] expects perfection in his church and I
[37:52] wrote some scriptures here that pertains
[37:55] to perfection
[37:56] we'll read each one of them fast Hebrews
[38:04] chapter 6 verse 1 therefore having
[38:07] leaving the principles of the ducting of
[38:09] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[38:11] perfection not laying again the
[38:14] foundation of repentance from dead works
[38:16] and Anna faith or God and so on and so
[38:18] forth let us go on to perfection Matthew
[38:23] 5:48
[38:24] Jesus said be it therefore perfect even
[38:27] as your father which is evan is it which
[38:30] is in heaven is perfect
[38:32] first questions chapter 13 verse 9 for
[38:35] ye for we are glad that when we are weak
[38:39] ye are strong and this also we wish even
[38:44] your perfection this is the desire of
[38:47] the ministers your perfection efficient
[38:52] efficient chapter 4 verse 11 about the
[38:55] fivefold ministry gave some supposes and
[38:59] some prophets and some evangelists and
[39:00] some pastors and teachers what for for
[39:03] the perfecting of the Saints for the
[39:06] work of the ministry and for the
[39:08] edifying of the body of Christ
[39:12] you see this is what sets us apart from
[39:16] denominational Christians because you
[39:20] know they they also know that the gospel
[39:26] of salvation Christ is the only way they
[39:31] also receive Christ they believe the
[39:34] Word of God hallelujah but you see they
[39:39] became Saints right meaning they've been
[39:44] forgiven of their sins we we accept that
[39:48] but the Bible says we need a fivefold
[39:51] ministry for the perfecting of the
[39:53] Saints they can they they they may be
[39:57] Saints but Saints need to be perfected
[40:01] hallelujah and I'm so happy that God has
[40:05] provided a way a fivefold ministry for
[40:09] the Saints to be perfected hallelujah
[40:12] amen
[40:14] the preacher said yesterday there's no
[40:17] rupture as apart from this message
[40:21] because there is no perfection
[40:24] apart from this message hallelujah and
[40:29] thank God that God has made a way for
[40:33] all of us to come to this state of
[40:36] perfection but if I think about it you
[40:41] know it's it's a real tall order
[40:44] the next slide says God requires perfect
[40:49] holiness we think we have holiness
[40:53] certain kind of holiness but it is not
[40:56] just any kind of holiness God requires
[41:00] Balaban said God requires perfect
[41:02] holiness no one can stand in its image
[41:09] with one little speck of sin Jesus
[41:14] witness the same and said be perfect
[41:16] perfect just like God is in heaven God
[41:20] in heaven is perfect we think perfection
[41:31] is dress and skirts this part of it
[41:36] that's a that's just many times what we
[41:40] think holiness is is just an art outward
[41:45] manifestation or external external
[41:52] holiness we call it hallelujah but Berta
[41:57] Burnham clearly tells us here that less
[42:01] not real holiness holiness is
[42:04] sinlessness holiness being consecrated
[42:09] and dedicated to God being separated
[42:12] from the world holiness is being absent
[42:19] from sin from sinning hallelujah you
[42:24] cannot stand in His image with one
[42:28] little speck of sin you have to remember
[42:30] that and this is a very tall order
[42:34] hallelujah so we need to ask the
[42:39] question do I have this kind of holiness
[42:44] do I possess it but thank God Birnbaum
[42:50] says it's not it's not how God looks at
[42:54] you
[42:56] it's how God looks at no it's not how
[43:00] people look at you I should say it's how
[43:03] God looks at you he says now I'm not
[43:07] perfect in your side can say men we try
[43:14] to gates one another and judge one
[43:16] another but Bertrand said I'm not
[43:19] perfect in your side the Prophet saying
[43:22] is I'm not perfect in your son and said
[43:25] you may not be perfect in my side but
[43:29] what about in God's sight
[43:31] see there's birdlace and if you're born
[43:36] again into the body of Christ then God
[43:39] looks upon you us firm as a perfect as
[43:43] Christ was himself Oh hallelujah if
[43:50] you're born again God looks upon you as
[43:53] perfect as Christ hallelujah amen the
[44:02] next slide waters of separation Bertram
[44:05] said it's nothing you can do it's not by
[44:10] any works you can do at all it's by
[44:15] grace God has give you this offer and
[44:18] you have accepted it in the sight of God
[44:23] you are perfect oh my I love that in the
[44:28] sight of God you are perfect that's the
[44:32] main thing in the sight of men they see
[44:34] all the imperfections hallelujah but in
[44:38] the sight of God you are perfect
[44:41] redeemed washed in the blood of the lamb
[44:45] without fault without blemish without
[44:48] spot isn't that marvelous
[44:53] hallelujah and this perfection stayed
[44:57] the perfection let me say this it's only
[45:00] attainable in this age
[45:03] you could not have this kind of
[45:06] perfection but Obama was talking about
[45:08] and Skippy was talking about in in past
[45:11] ages it's only attainable in this aids
[45:17] sardian Church says he said isn't that
[45:19] beautiful or mine I love that not
[45:23] perfect why because they were justified
[45:26] Birnbaum was talking about the past ages
[45:29] the age of Luther they were justified
[45:32] and Luther preached justification and
[45:35] you had to be sanctified and then filled
[45:37] with the Holy Ghost and there wasn't
[45:39] their own then there wasn't their own
[45:41] and they were perfected by the Holy
[45:44] Spirit in them it's not the Christian
[45:48] that is perfect it's the perfect Holy
[45:52] Spirit in him see that's what I that's
[45:55] why I've said I ain't it ate a holy
[45:58] mountain it's the holy God on the
[46:01] mountain not the holy God in the Holy
[46:04] Church not the holy people but it's a
[46:07] Holy Ghost in the church and its people
[46:10] hallelujah we're talking about the Holy
[46:13] Spirit here residing in it in the hearts
[46:17] of his people
[46:19] hallelujah so in the past we could talk
[46:24] about sacrifice in the Bible speaks
[46:32] about gift love faith Liberty today we
[46:40] have come to perfection and now we speak
[46:44] about a perfect sacrifice we speak about
[46:48] the perfect gift perfect love perfect
[46:51] faith perfect Liberty hallelujah perfect
[46:56] faith can only come by the perfect word
[46:59] today we can also preach about the
[47:02] perfect Liberty because we now have a
[47:04] perfect message brothers and sisters let
[47:08] me let me let me make a statement we
[47:11] have been set free
[47:13] amen we have perfect liberty in Christ
[47:18] hallelujah because of what he did at the
[47:21] cross of Calvary in Ephesians chapter 4
[47:25] verse 13 it says this is the purpose of
[47:30] the fivefold ministry now it says till
[47:34] we all come in the unity of the faith
[47:37] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[47:40] unto a perfect man this is the purpose
[47:46] of the fivefold ministry we need to come
[47:49] together and benefit from the gift
[47:51] god-given gift from this man that God is
[47:54] using to minister to us the Word of God
[47:56] until we all come into the unity of the
[48:00] faith and until we come to the perfect
[48:04] man the stature of a perfect man unto
[48:06] the measure of the stature of the
[48:09] fullness of Christ you see we are
[48:13] measured against Christ who is the gold
[48:16] standard of perfection the stature of a
[48:21] perfect man is really Christ hallelujah
[48:25] you cannot attribute it to any any man
[48:28] any human being
[48:29] it's Christ alone and by the message of
[48:35] the hour which is a perfect message you
[48:41] can become the word the perfect word BAM
[48:46] said in the message perfect faith Jesus
[48:48] had perfect faith he had it and it come
[48:53] because he was the word and you become
[48:57] the word you become the word as you
[49:00] received the word is that simple enough
[49:04] how do you become the word the perfect
[49:07] word you become the word as she received
[49:09] the word if you abide in me and my words
[49:12] abide in you and ask what you will shall
[49:16] be done into you first John chapter 1
[49:20] verse 8 to 10 now this is
[49:27] every believer is susceptible to this
[49:31] this is self-deception the Bible says if
[49:37] we say that we have no sin we deceive
[49:40] ourselves and the truth is not in us but
[49:47] if we confess our sins then he is
[49:50] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[49:52] sins and to cleanse us from all
[49:54] unrighteousness
[49:55] if we say that we have not sinned then
[49:59] we make him a liar and the word is not
[50:02] enough there's no two ways about it
[50:10] we say we don't sin we're not only
[50:14] deceiving ourselves we're actually we're
[50:19] actually thinking that we can deceive
[50:21] God there's no way we can deceive God
[50:27] you're just deceiving yourself
[50:30] hallelujah you are a sinner hallelujah
[50:37] but praise God because God looks at his
[50:40] sin first John chapter 3 verse 9
[50:44] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[50:48] sin so thank God for rebirth hallelujah
[50:59] does not commit sin or unbelief for his
[51:04] seed remain it in him and he cannot see
[51:06] nor disbelieve because he is born of God
[51:12] we say we continue to sin even after our
[51:15] conversion but see God is not looking at
[51:19] your sin he look he's looking at the
[51:23] seed that's in that's in you and once
[51:27] you're born of God
[51:28] the Bible says the the seed of God
[51:30] remains in you and God is looking at
[51:34] that seed and that seed came from him
[51:39] that's it is the world in you hallelujah
[51:44] it's the perfect word hallelujah and
[51:48] there there can be no sin in that seed
[51:53] it's in proof if your God said your sim
[51:59] proof hallelujah that's why brother
[52:06] Branham countless of times he told of
[52:11] this story of the evangelists I think he
[52:14] he calls him Daniel Greenfield in the
[52:17] cousin something else in other stories
[52:20] that he told but he said Daniel
[52:24] Greenfield my justice requires
[52:27] perfection this was of the judgment bar
[52:31] now so the question was was you perfect
[52:35] when you was when you was in your life
[52:37] and Daniel Greenfield thought he never
[52:42] told a lie but in the presence of God
[52:45] that great Shekinah glory every little
[52:49] lie is exposed and magnified and when
[52:53] God asked him have you ever told a lie
[52:56] couldn't deny said yes Lord I told a lie
[53:01] in my life I've stole I did bad things
[53:05] in my life I was not perfect the
[53:11] question was was you perfect when he was
[53:13] in your life and he said no Lord I
[53:16] wasn't perfect I think we can all say
[53:22] this in our life we weren't perfect and
[53:26] said he was waitin to hear the last
[53:31] blast he was ready to hear the judgement
[53:35] of God
[53:35] depart from me you worker of iniquity
[53:38] but instead in the next slide instead
[53:42] said he heard a voice it was the spirit
[53:46] voice he has ever heard in his life
[53:50] and it turned to look and he said he saw
[53:54] the sweetest face that he ever saw said
[53:58] no mother could look could look or talk
[54:01] like that he said as he walked up close
[54:04] to him he put his hand upon his shoulder
[54:06] and he said unto him father that is true
[54:11] Danny Greenfield here in his earthly
[54:14] journey he wasn't perfect but there's
[54:19] one thing that he did when he was in
[54:21] earth he stood for me and now while he's
[54:27] here in heaven I will stand for him all
[54:31] of his sins put it on my account
[54:34] hallelujah
[54:35] Oh aren't you glad that we have a
[54:37] redeemer we have a savior hallelujah
[54:42] glory to God Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11
[54:49] to 14 we have a high priest right and
[54:53] every priest standard daily ministering
[54:56] and offering oftentimes the same
[54:58] sacrifices which can never take away
[55:00] sins but this man referring to the Lord
[55:06] Jesus this man after he had offered one
[55:09] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[55:13] the right hand of God and from
[55:15] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[55:18] made his foot so for by one offering he
[55:22] has perfected forever them that are
[55:25] sacrifice by one offering Jesus Christ
[55:32] offering his life for the ran for a
[55:35] ransom for many
[55:36] hallelujah he has perfected them that
[55:40] are sanctified see what I'm talking
[55:42] about
[55:43] you can be a saint but you need to be
[55:45] perfected and we are perfected not by
[55:50] the things that we do not by our own
[55:53] efforts not by our practicing our
[55:57] religion hallelujah but you are
[56:00] perfected because of what Christ did on
[56:03] Carol
[56:07] hallelujah but then we have been
[56:16] perfected we can say that we can confess
[56:19] that but Bell Graham said we still have
[56:23] this stick in nature in us he said and
[56:27] as long I sure in this life are we still
[56:30] in this life as long as you're in this
[56:33] lab you're going to be sticky and have a
[56:37] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[56:40] as long as you live it's because of this
[56:43] flesh here hallelujah because you've
[56:46] been born again in your soul the spirit
[56:49] man but not the flesh hallelujah
[56:52] huh it is to be redeemed later on you
[57:00] will help to have a carnal nature that's
[57:02] going to bother you as long as you live
[57:04] but inside of you you're born again and
[57:08] when you're raised up you're in the
[57:11] likeness of Christ and all the scene
[57:14] that has gone from you see that's the
[57:17] thing but in spite of all of this we can
[57:22] claim perfection by faith we still have
[57:26] this stick in nature
[57:28] that's why st. Paul told the Philippians
[57:33] in in Philippians chapter 3 verse 12 to
[57:36] 14 we are all a work in progress
[57:40] hallelujah amen Philippians chapter 3
[57:45] verse 12 to 14 verse 12 says not as
[57:49] though I had already attained this is
[57:52] Paul speaking now not as though I had
[57:55] already attained either were already
[57:58] perfect but I follow after that I may be
[58:04] apprehended that for which also I am
[58:07] apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I
[58:13] count not myself to have apprehended
[58:16] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[58:20] things which which are behind and
[58:23] reaching forth unto those things which
[58:25] are before hallelujah I press toward the
[58:30] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[58:33] God in Christ Jesus hallelujah
[58:39] hallelujah Paul was saying I'm not
[58:43] saying I have attained it but I'm
[58:46] looking to the future
[58:49] amen after Christ has taken possession
[58:52] of my life and thus the I looked at the
[58:56] Greek lexing that's this the meaning of
[58:59] the word apprehended apprehend in the
[59:03] word
[59:03] the Greek word used his Catalan bono
[59:08] which means to seize upon or take
[59:11] possession Paul was saying you know I'm
[59:16] not saying I'm perfect
[59:17] but I'm looking to that time when Christ
[59:19] will take possession of my whole life
[59:22] hallelujah to see his take possession of
[59:26] Christ by his holy power and influence
[59:29] laying hold of the human mind and will
[59:32] in order to prompt and govern it oh my
[59:37] hallelujah that's why we say Paul said I
[59:44] no longer live but it's Christ that
[59:48] believeth within me he has full control
[59:51] of my whole life now my mind my actions
[59:56] everything that sent me Christ controls
[59:59] it completely hallelujah and this is the
[1:00:02] power of the gospel
[1:00:06] Berta Branham says I have no Holiness
[1:00:12] listen to the Prophet now I have no
[1:00:16] Holiness to present to him but I'm
[1:00:21] trusting in his Oh his grace
[1:00:27] and I have it in my heart I have
[1:00:30] unmerited it nothing I could do to
[1:00:34] deserve it
[1:00:35] but by grace he called me and invited me
[1:00:39] to come and I look to him and he took
[1:00:43] the desire away from me Miriam says I
[1:00:46] make thousands of mistakes in each month
[1:00:50] I say the same amen
[1:00:57] this is the part of God's speaking now
[1:01:00] he makes thousands of mistake every
[1:01:02] month every year sure he said I do but
[1:01:08] when I see him wrong I say God I didn't
[1:01:11] mean to do it you know my heart I didn't
[1:01:15] mean to do that I was trapped into that
[1:01:18] and I didn't mean to do it
[1:01:20] you forgive me Lord and then he says if
[1:01:26] I done wrong to my brother I say brother
[1:01:29] forgive me
[1:01:30] I didn't mean to do that certainly God
[1:01:35] knows my heart oh there you are
[1:01:38] there is the blood sacrifice there is
[1:01:42] the power of the gospel that the Holy
[1:01:46] Church moving on not because something
[1:01:50] you've done it's something you had
[1:01:52] nothing to do with there is the
[1:01:55] atonement oh I'm so glad that's nothing
[1:01:59] to do with what I've done it has
[1:02:02] everything to do with what he's done
[1:02:04] hallelujah and then better madam goes on
[1:02:08] to say and we want to be so big we were
[1:02:14] some kind of a big turnaround collar
[1:02:16] some kind of clothes you know that makes
[1:02:19] us look so holy and reverent but there
[1:02:23] is no holiness with us
[1:02:29] I'm talking to message believers now we
[1:02:35] think we're holy quran says there's no
[1:02:39] holiness in us we cannot be holy
[1:02:43] holiness is of God see certainly it
[1:02:48] ain't a Holy Church it ain't a holy
[1:02:51] mountain it's a holy God that's right
[1:02:54] not not the holy people it's a holy God
[1:02:57] it's God in the people
[1:02:59] Peter referred to the mountains
[1:03:02] figuration as the holy mount it meant
[1:03:05] the holy God was on that mountain look
[1:03:08] at it now there's nothing holy about
[1:03:10] that mountain no hallelujah but it's God
[1:03:14] descending upon that mountain hallelujah
[1:03:18] and abiding in it that what that's what
[1:03:21] made it holy but it was a holy God there
[1:03:25] the presence of God is what made it holy
[1:03:29] I can say the same thing about the
[1:03:32] Church of Jesus Christ it's the presence
[1:03:35] of God that makes her holy hallelujah
[1:03:40] we have no holiness a percent to God
[1:03:44] we're just trusting in his holiness
[1:03:48] hallelujah now brother banner made this
[1:03:54] illustration about the wheat plant and
[1:03:58] he said that the real true believers
[1:04:00] they go on because the wheat they come
[1:04:04] in different stages and different form
[1:04:08] different from the the form that was
[1:04:12] originally buried and planted the grain
[1:04:15] the grain of wheat huh like the blades
[1:04:19] are different they look different from
[1:04:21] the wheat of grain and the tassels the
[1:04:24] same and then we go to the even the shop
[1:04:28] hallelujah that's sweet but better BAM
[1:04:31] said now from Wesley came forth pilgrim
[1:04:35] holiness the Nazarenes
[1:04:39] I'm just thinking but a deal that this
[1:04:45] is this is the way that the work of God
[1:04:53] progressed you know from from Lutheran's
[1:04:57] to the worst lian's and was to preach
[1:05:01] sanctification and out of that group
[1:05:04] came to holiness groups pilgrim holiness
[1:05:08] and everything and better I'm even
[1:05:10] mentioned specifically pilgrim holiness
[1:05:13] the Nazarenes and all them little
[1:05:15] holding as churches a whole lot more
[1:05:17] closer to the word then that the
[1:05:20] Lutheran for Reformation Russ but you
[1:05:24] see when Luther organized that just
[1:05:26] started those blades and when this comes
[1:05:28] up all the spirit left at Lutheran
[1:05:31] Church all that just all but just
[1:05:34] denominational and the real true
[1:05:36] believers went on into sanctification
[1:05:41] Lutheran stopped but the Reeb believers
[1:05:45] went on into sanctification there's no
[1:05:47] stopping as long as God is working they
[1:05:51] walked with God and continued on with
[1:05:54] the Lord and and and listen to what
[1:05:58] Moran said and then when the
[1:05:59] sanctification moved over the pilgrim
[1:06:02] holiness and so forth the holiness
[1:06:05] organizations the NASA is the NASA means
[1:06:09] it moved from there out into this panic
[1:06:13] hostile age
[1:06:16] these are critical states now and we
[1:06:20] will think of holiness we think of the
[1:06:23] Pentecostal groups the holiness groups
[1:06:26] and better venom even classified it the
[1:06:30] holiness the the holiness groups the
[1:06:33] Pentecostal people hallelujah
[1:06:36] he said they look more like the whit
[1:06:39] grain that fell in the ground but you
[1:06:43] have to look closely
[1:06:47] and look at the little green now of
[1:06:51] wheat says it looks a million times more
[1:06:55] like the original we talking about the
[1:06:59] holiness group Pentecostal group
[1:07:02] it looks like million times more like
[1:07:07] the original wheat that went into the
[1:07:10] ground then what the stock did or water
[1:07:14] or what the pollen did but but if you
[1:07:18] sit down put it under glass and open
[1:07:22] those little shucks up but we're talking
[1:07:24] about the shucks now they're just
[1:07:27] carriers also the grain hasn't started
[1:07:31] yet it's a little bitty ball right at
[1:07:34] the back with a big high-powered glass
[1:07:37] you can see the little tip like a
[1:07:40] pinpoint and there comes the scene and
[1:07:44] this here sharp look that looks like
[1:07:47] exactly like the real thing it isn't the
[1:07:50] real thing oh my this is what we have to
[1:07:54] realize sometimes we think we reach it
[1:07:59] we're at my bedroom said it's not the
[1:08:02] real thing
[1:08:04] hallelujah that we'll see that like a
[1:08:10] pinpoint has to come to that's to grow
[1:08:12] and come to maturity hallelujah in order
[1:08:17] to become like the bee four minutes of
[1:08:22] the original water went into the ground
[1:08:25] hallelujah and this your shop that looks
[1:08:30] just like exactly the real thing isn't
[1:08:33] the real thing it's only a womb
[1:08:39] now of course America has gone through
[1:08:47] this first before we go through it in
[1:08:54] the Philippines you know the message
[1:08:56] came from America to the Philippines
[1:08:59] but I see it more in our country people
[1:09:04] in the message Pentecostal people
[1:09:09] thinking that they are in the message
[1:09:12] all it is is a Pentecostal movement all
[1:09:16] of this is a Pentecostal concept if you
[1:09:23] look at the way they dress the way they
[1:09:25] act their prayer life even oh they look
[1:09:30] sanctified they look holy and and they
[1:09:34] think they have it they have the Holy
[1:09:36] Ghost because they're there they live
[1:09:39] clean lives but I'm thinking now
[1:09:42] wherever I'm said it looks like the real
[1:09:45] thing but it's not the real thing
[1:09:47] Halloween doesn't it doesn't have the
[1:09:49] substance that's needed hallelujah
[1:09:52] The Cedars that come to maturity
[1:09:56] hallelujah and this this is a big
[1:09:58] mistake of many believers they think
[1:10:02] sanctification is the baptism of the
[1:10:05] Holy Ghost because they were sanctified
[1:10:08] they think they had it no they have to
[1:10:10] go on hallelujah they have to lay the
[1:10:15] fundamentals the basic teachings amen
[1:10:19] and and go on to perfection hallelujah
[1:10:22] and brothers and sisters we now have a
[1:10:25] message of perfection we can go on to
[1:10:29] perfection hallelujah amen it's not by
[1:10:32] our own effort anyway it's not it's not
[1:10:37] how how how we show or manifests other
[1:10:41] to one another before the people it's
[1:10:45] not how the people look at you it's it's
[1:10:49] how God looks at you and in the eyes of
[1:10:52] God you stand perfect because Christ is
[1:10:58] perfect he has made you perfect
[1:11:01] a menu low - god that's so st. we sing
[1:11:12] we sing that song to be like Jesus a man
[1:11:16] that's like calling the musicians to
[1:11:19] come I want to be like Jesus
[1:11:22] it's my desire even though in my
[1:11:26] physical abilities I'm not able to do it
[1:11:28] there's nothing we can do to be like
[1:11:30] Christ but it's the power of the gospel
[1:11:34] the power of the message that they've
[1:11:37] heard you can become right likewise
[1:11:41] because you can become the word as she
[1:11:45] received the word and we receive the
[1:11:50] Word of God this morning
[1:11:52] amen perfection is in Christ our
[1:11:56] holiness is in Christ our perfection is
[1:12:00] in Christ it doesn't look at our
[1:12:04] imperfections the little witnesses the
[1:12:07] sins that we commit every day but God is
[1:12:10] looking at the perfect lamb our perfect
[1:12:13] sacrifice then we can have perfect
[1:12:16] confidence that even though we have we
[1:12:19] still have this stick in nature we try
[1:12:21] our best but we're trapped in this body
[1:12:25] hallelujah and like the brother said
[1:12:28] earlier doesn't care how you feel
[1:12:33] because sometimes we don't feel like
[1:12:37] we're even saved
[1:12:38] sometimes but it doesn't matter about
[1:12:41] how you feel what matters most is what
[1:12:46] God did on the cross you have been saved
[1:12:50] you have been justified you have been
[1:12:51] brought out washed in the water of the
[1:12:54] word you have been perfected in our day
[1:12:57] and age we've heard the perfect message
[1:13:00] hallelujah that can perfect it

[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:23] you don't run around him said if God
[1:16:26] required it when he said be therefore
[1:16:28] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:16:31] perfect
[1:16:33] he made a requirement he said now if he
[1:16:37] made a requirement
[1:16:39] and he knows we can't do it said then
[1:16:47] he's taken care of he made it the word
[1:16:52] that can be done in him
[1:16:54] you perfection as in Jesus Christ
[1:16:58] so he's told us we had to be perfect
[1:17:01] he made a way missed accept Jesus Christ
[1:17:04] as your Savior that makes you just as
[1:17:07] perfect as God is because is his work
[1:17:13] what about this remind him of his work
[1:17:22] just remind him of what he said
[1:17:28] we have no perfection as our brother
[1:17:31] says nothing in us but in Jesus Christ
[1:17:40] we're perfect see perfect we think of
[1:17:44] perfect as being something that were
[1:17:46] sinless that's not the point
[1:17:49] perfect means complete complete
[1:17:54] that's not perfectly complete so if B
[1:17:58] therefore complete that's what she's
