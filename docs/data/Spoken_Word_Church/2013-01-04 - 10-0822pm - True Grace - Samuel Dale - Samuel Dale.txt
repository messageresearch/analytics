can study it from the word amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Ephesians 2 and Romans 6 Ephesians 2 and Romans 6 brother Joe gave me a quote off of a message there while ago where I was talking about this morning about that God is not up in heaven you know that's in Deuteronomy 30 there U that TI us you know we don't need somebody to go up and get him he's here so this is off of a message called deity of Christ Jesus Christ in 1949 um 12:25 and that same power that same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little draw down something you're not you're Sons and Daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you amen okay I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you it's all right my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being amen so he's not in heaven he's here in he amen got your scriptures Ephesians 2 Romans 6 father we thank you for your love and your grace and thank you for the opportunity to be able to stand here before the purchase of your blood today and talk to your people about what you've revealed into our heart and what you want to be said we pray that you would just have the preeminence in each and every one of us guide us now bless those that are not here and when they hear the tape you bless them also Lord we love you and we commit everything into your hands now that father you would come on the scene in each one of our hearts and lives because as we've talked about you for many many services you're not off up in heaven you're here so now it's time for us to realize that and to walk therein have your way now and keep us in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 2 we'll go 1 through n and then we'll go to Romans 6 and and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time pass you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the hour the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind but were by Nature the children of Wrath excuse and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by Grace you are saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast all right let's go into R back to Romans then 6 just one verse verse 10 for in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God you may be seated Lord at blessing to the reading of the word I hope you enjoyed the series we tried to put in on the coming of the Lord and this is not a backing up this is a going forward because remember the message we talked about or where we were at this morning that brother Brandon was talking about that the in Christ the mystery how that the uh head and body would Unite in the last days to bring the message well then I think it's about time to tell the message we're trying to bring because uh you know to bring that brother Ram was a prophet that's part of it yes we believe that because without him we wouldn't have no we would have no hes whatsoever so we put all of that into where that God kept his word about fulfilling Malachi 4 but now if he fulfill Malachi 4 then would he not fulfill all of the scriptures now because he you say well he he he he done it for brother R but I don't know where he'd do it for me if God ever promises you anything what are you worried about right you know if he promises and you really know it's a promise from God you know I'm like brother Ram you know when God told me that that that Wade was coming back to him and then when he told me later he'd be standing here in the pull pit with me I didn't care who knew it amen I would have told the whole world right I had to put it in a in a paper around the world cuz that doesn't bother me cuz I I believe it you know but now I want to just not back up into the message but like I'm telling you now listen please listen to me for one time listen carefully uh I'm not backing up we are going forward but it is time to realize realization of Who We Are and what we're doing here and to stand on those things and why would it not be that you know if we drop back and preach of the new birth why what would be the trouble we now know what the new birth is what would it be to drop back and preach this or drop back as we call no you you notice one thing brother brandham preached the message and he preached it because I've expressed this to you many many times he preached up until 62 and there was there a lot of messages back there that were wonderful message I mean all of them are but then in when the seals open unto him he said it become a brand new book right well I think it's about time that we stop quoting that quote that it's become a new book and to read the book amen and to read it with the language of the day and I don't mean the World Language I'm talking about the language of the Revelation and then that way we can can follow therein and and not have no trouble so uh keep that in mind as we go along down the message right because as I said now the head and body is to unite in the last days and if it's not the same material it cannot unite so if he's the word we must be the word all right well you know little church just word word word well what are you I got no problems what are you what do you claim to be well I'm great Revelation well uh come down let's talk about it might find out to like you got it in Revelation cuz that's none that's not you say well well I I just read between the lines well I've been over that and over that if what's between the lines is different than what's on the lines there's something wrong with you're reading now it's got to be the same it's got to be the same God well it's just deeper all right let's see it tie together right you can't start out with a a doctrine of of of one God and wind up with a doctrine of two Lords see then you claim it's a great Revelation written between the lines I'd have to agree it's written somewhere cuz it's not in the lines or on the lines but anyhow now let's go on so then the we was talking about how the headstone in Zechariah said it would be coming crying Grace Grace all right then how can we have any other message besides Grace you know how can we do it see now you say but brother Dale there's a lot of in the Bible about judgment but you better read real careful because judgment follows after the rejecting of the word right so then the rejecting of the word is what causes judgment to come all right now we're not talking about disgrace to just live like anything or whatever uh we're talking about true Grace is what we're going to talk about today I don't know may continue on a little bit on it but anyhow just put a title true true Grace because to me now there's only one message in this Bible right this Bible is the revealing of one true and living God right where he's at what he's doing and how that it's been the Believers in the book all the way down through that come out to make it a book to where that it can be done but what's it been it's been God revealing himself right manifesting himself all right then in that then there's only the the revealing of God through the word would be the message of true Grace right amen and that way we would understand what it's all about all right now said you say well I read a lot about judgment we just remember what you're reading is because you've turned down the word right you turn down the word you're judged right right you don't have to be judged later you're already judged all right now but if we'll read the Bible real carefully we'll see that when we reject God's word or anybody down through there's ever done it then that is what makes it change from grace to judgment all right now where do we get on right now here in just a minute and then we'll we'll get our Point all right so listen now let's just think about this and I want you to listen real carefully to what I'm saying and don't run off you know because I say something and run off and try to explain it to everybody sitting around you or whatever just listen to what I'm saying and and let's see what's going on now we we read the Bible and we talk about Grace and we say well we're saved by grace and then we turn around and we spend a lot of time explaining that Grace is unmar favor okay that's good cuz that's what it means it's if if it's anything besides unmar favor the word Grace would not be connected that's right but now here's what I want you to think about we say we're saved by grace you know that when Jesus Christ died every person in the world was saved that day I told you going to listen now cuz see you run your little computer brain up ahead and jump off and I can't help that listen to what said and we'll come back to TI it all together in a moment but you see we read in Romans were that he died once for all that's right now he didn't die one time for the bride and one time for the Jews and one time for the foolish virgin and one time for this group for whatever no he died one time H thank you Lord and see when he died he paid the price that's right right all right now that's why you hear the prophet saying he said people are not Sinners he said because we're under the bumper blood of the Lord Jesus Christ say there's nobody right now A Center into the face of God right because he paid the price now you say but now brother Dale you okay let's I like to walk on thin ice anyway because you know you generally find something there wonderful let me just read something your Prophet said wedding supper 1956 10:06 the preparation has been appropriated for your salvation Christ died once and settled sin question forever you were saved the very hour that Christ died you were saved the very hour that Christ died okay now that Ain all he said every person that ever lived in the world from that time hence was saved at that time and ever healing that was ever performed the appropriation of the blood was shed at Calvary for every healing that would ever be taken place when Jesus died at Calvary it settled a question of sin and every attribute of sin now brother brandom you mean everybody's saved yeah right if you believe it you say yeah but now we know that you got to finish the rest of the story amen all right but get the story then we finish the rest of it cuz you see everybody is saved by grace right amen now there's no such thing as uh the bride being saved by grace the the foolish virgins saved by a different Grace or a different way or or the the Jews you know to be saved by another Grace there's only one one Grace so everybody in the world was saved what the day Jesus Christ died right amen what's the problem now can't believe the problem is is people won't accept it right that's right are you understanding what I'm trying to drive the point right see if you're not careful you're actually thinking that in some special way you want God to go back up on the cross and die again for you you know no he died once for all am all in the world are saved by grace now what do you think they're saved by now even the uh cup of water in my name see I like to cover that because I know how the human mind starts clicking when you say something it go you know over to fast forward on to another place and you don't hear what said for quite a while I did but no no you don't so you click over that's right see everybody in the world is saved if they'll accept it that's right so everybody saved by grace amen now but brother Dale you're telling me everybody in the world save yes it f accept it that's right amen if they W accept it now whose problem is it all right get the point driven down hard in your thinking and you'll understand why brother Brandon would make that statement that every person in the world was saved that day every person in the world was healed that day right cuz they were saved by grace nobody in the world deserved what happened at Calvary am right oh you goody goody you thank you doo oh I'm glad I didn't do what other people done if I have done what Brother Gary Atkins are doing God would have never saved me I'm glad I didn't do it now where is any Grace involved right if it's anything that you think of in any way that you would have to be able to present before God then why would Jesus Christ have to die at Calvary brother randam even the greatest he could think of when he was you remember when he was shot by the gun by his little buddy and and all and he was falling down and he was going towards hell and his vision or whatever it was you remember what he said said the only thing I can say Lord is I didn't commit adultery or something like that he had one thing he could say but you know that didn't save him see that's what people think we right in and God just turned it around and started him right back up the other way you know no just get one thing in your mind that no matter what Hebrew series the prophet of God said I'd hate to think that I was born five minutes ago and have to face God at death now what could a five minute old baby do he said I hate the that he said because I was born in sin shaped in iniquity and spoused my mother's wound of liar right I know and I don't throw off on you know how I love little babies but you look down at a little baby and you say ah beautiful little liar but you don't want people to want you to call her baby a liar but they will be don't you worry about it they they'll do it one of these days you just keep on for a little while but now get my point so we can take the Bible and the prophet's message and we can isolate things pick you know what we want and and we can make it say anything but get to Foundation now and then we'll move on into the point of what we're talking about on true Grace there's not a Grace for the Jews and a Grace for the bride and a Grace for the foolish virgin the grace for like I said the cup of water in my name just remember it was that's based upon the grace that there was somebody there that was a member of the bride of Christ that was standing there it's not just a couple of water given to every drunk on the street right you know so it's still Grace amen all right are you listening right see the prophet of God said true Grace straightened out he said not disgrace he said but true Grace to understand a real Revelation about Grace So then every person is saved by grace now what does that make you any different than anybody else see now we read where Paul said that we were like the others we were of the world we've done these things we were these things you know that's where uh the people of the message they seem to forget where they come from you know they're real good about saying I never did Sin the prophet said I was saved all the way well those things are true but if they're not placed in the correct order they're just like what I laid out before you MH I just laid out before you an outstanding statement didn't it that everybody in the world was saved when Jesus Christ died and every person that was you know would ever be healed or anything that was healed when Jesus Christ took the stripes now we know then that there's something wrong with the story if that's what we're holding to so then we just read basically what we want to read like brother Mo used to say you know uh the Bible said Thou shalt not steal and uh he'd say but the Bible don't say thou shal not steal chickens so it'd be okay to steal chickens but you'd have to find out what the word would follow that to know what you couldn't steal you right you'd be surprised what our thinking is a lot of times right let's go back and read our scripture again and get the correct answer from the scripture and not from our uh concept go back in uh Ephesians and let's get the right understanding you know what we're talking about the reading we'll go down about verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you're saved all right so then everybody in the world is saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the Ages come he might show show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus now watching for by grace are you saved through faith and there's your key right said well we know that okay that's good so then everybody is saved by grace he paid the price for everybody why your Prophet would say the bumper blood's laying there and there's no sinner in the presence of God at this moment he said but when that blood is removed you don't want to be there but see now we're seeing that it says true Faith so by grace are you saved through Faith now the word true is a a word like something that you uh you go in a pip you come out through you know or something you go through or whatever life is and and everything but it's true faith in other words now you have something to do with it I know I'm making you think that's what I want you to do at least try anyway I can't play in everybody's brains but you know sometimes I have trouble playing in my own but you just say but Brother D I'm saved by grace that's not what the Bible says yeah it is it says right there above that I'm saved by grace everybody is okay H I didn't say these things you're prophets when taught it you claim to believe him but it notice the point is it says and by grace are you saved through faith now something is happening to you you have started a journey see by accepting Jesus Christ as your savior you have started a journey and that Journey will travel sometimes a short while or whatever it can be quick or it can be longer according to your faith but now to just say that I'm saved by faith now if you were on the level with me and we're talking that's all right but remember if you're just on the level of saying Saved By Faith then everybody's saved by faith but you see what I've done and what we must do as individuals we have taken what God has done and died for our sins all right died for our sins just like he died for everybody no brother Dale he only died for me well that's all right you must believe it only died for you because that's you got to be personal that's all right but now see then he gave everybody an opportunity right amen that's what I'm trying to get you to see he has given everybody in the world an opportunity to be saved right cuz he paid the price but because we will not accept what God has done for us then it doesn't go on to the stage of saying through faith through Revelation cuz you're saved by Revelation right it's got to be revealed to you so it's through faith now through faith God brings you and I through a journey of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost out through adoption ET coming all the way to the chain of the body he has made a way for us to travel that Journey but Brother D I thought it was all on him choosing well I thought we didn't believe that he chose one and rejected the other just because he liked one better than the other one that's right I thought something we had to do with it amen I thought the reason he could say Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated was the fact that he what Jacob and Esau would do that was what I thought it's been based on if I've missed that I'm sorry but I believe that would tie together with predestination adoption Etc will tie together huh see but justification and sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost is a journey that you and I take take through faith or by faith if you want to use the word but I'm just saying it through faith because of what we're going to get down to in a minute you know that basically as recurred or spoken of now I said basically cuz I'll show you the others then in the Old Testament they were actually saved by faith but in the New Testament we're saved through faith he said well okay let's read a few scriptures look at Romans 3 and3 let's just see if we can show that by the scripture verse 29 is he the god of the Jews only is not is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also see it is one God God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith right y now so that's why you find if you read R uh read Hebrews 11 we'll get to it if we have time in a minute you'll see basically that it'll say by faith Abraham offered unto God by faith so and so of the Old Testament but then when you get in closer to where we are it'll say through faith we understand the worlds were framed right see so get in mind what we're looking at look at Galatians 3:8 you like me I have a hard time finding some of this so I put a marker in mine right after second Cor Galatians 3:8 and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed justify the Heathen now we know who the Heathen are right that's us us you you know Gentiles now was the Heathen was the Gentiles but what I'm trying to do is to get you to look it through and let's go over there to Hebrews while we at we got to look down Hebrews 11 he lays down a great subject while you're getting there because he said now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand the the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not were not made of things which do appear now watch by faith Abel offered unto God see True by True by True by remember what I'm saying there's not a difference in Salvation it's all by Grace but it's showing you that one of them was looking forward to it and the other is looking back for to it because we're going through the Journey that's why we're through faith we're going through a journey they were looking forward to something see by faith able offer under God a more excellent sacrifice and Cain that what you obtain witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speak by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him now then without a revelation Faith it's impossible to pleas God because you must believe that he is by faith Noah verse 7 by faith Abraham verse 8 talking verse n of how he sojourned but now look when it comes to Sarah which would be a type of the Bride right look what what it says in verse 11 through faith also sah herself received seed see I wrote in my Bible a long time ago I said look at there that represents the bride cuz she did have something to do with going through right but you see it's not always it's that it's showing you the point of what I want you to see right that we think we're just what we're just saved by grace well everybody is but you see everybody we know is not going to be saved right we know that right everybody's not going to be saved but anybody that's ever saved is saved by grace God's unmar favor to come down and die for all of us but see we then we then as Believers accepting the fact that he he died in our place then we start that journey through faith and we travel a journey through the Christian journey and coming down to the basis that we can understand real Grace because now here's my point so listen you can't take the Journey of a Christian now I said the Journey of a Christian justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know adoption Etc you can't take that and turn out with disgrace right now you tell me you can I'll tell you there something wrong with you mentally it's not right right because if it's true Faith it's something you have went through with and see then you you know I've always told you the way I check a doctrine of somebody preaching I'm not sitting there saying oh he missed that quote he missed that one well you can do that easy right well he didn't quote all the words that was in that quote no brother Mo us and myself years ago we used to go around we'd find out that that everybody was saying brother so and so was off the message well that was the guy we wanted to hear because there's one thing about it he was stirring up more ground than the others were so we'd want to go hear him but I never check anybody what I check people by my new birth now you tell me what you check it by I'll check it by the prophet's message if you ain't got the new birth what have you got quotes it'll argue with quotes and you'll never come out to the correct understanding see what real Grace is yes but see it's true Faith now Romans 2 and 4 says that it's the goodness of God that leadth us to repentance all right so now the goodness of God is Grace so would there be any problem me saying there the grace of God leadth me to repentance but you see the born again Christian travels through a journey whereas other people are only making it so far through the Journey up and down or whatever and just saying well bless God I'm saved by grace so it don't matter what I do I'll be all right I'll be there cuz I'm predestinated now that's the quote of the people of the message that's right I'll be there cuz I'm predestinated well all right now now we'll go another round everybody in the world is predestinated you agree everybody's saved by grace you agree everybody's predestinated you agree everybody's going somewhere right would you agree now you agree they give you another one people lay heavily as I said the prophets not here where to change these things but you remember when he went beyond the curtain of time and he came back and I can find it but I just didn't even think about using it but he said I saw every one of you there well I've heard people say you know he saw me there but you better remember one thing come on he went to hell and he went to heaven right so he saw all of us somewhere right now that ain't the way it is brother D he saw me in heaven well if we don't make the journey right right if we don't make the journey through faith where is our judgment set far right we have turned down the grace of God that's right brother so then when the prophet said it's not what I do it's what he done what all right now if we don't understand that correctly then I apply it the same way it's not what anybody in the world done it's what God done right see grace sure that's unmar favor thank God but if I take that and I use it in the wrong way then I make it disgrace and that's not unmerited favor if I say it doesn't matter what I do I'm saved you brother brand said that yeah check what he's talking about that's right he never said check it and find it if you can he never said I go out and drink all I want to run around do whatever no what did he say but you see people use it that they'll just quote it to people over the pull pit and you know brother R said it's not what I do what he's already done well I Amen to see that don't make no difference what I do I can drink get no no no no no the one thing brother renam said about that it didn't matter what he done you'll check it he's talking about I don't have to preach to be saved that's right he said I'm saved anyway uhhuh he said if I go out and sit down and Don't Preach no more said it has nothing to do with my salvation now you find me where he said I can go out and drink gamble run around with women all Etc and still say that he's okay oh that changes the story doesn't it I'm sorry have I become your enemy because I studied the message and can tell the truth at least to what I want you know whatever but see grace is what brings us to God right now I'm looking at some of these quotes and so but that's off the message here you he 1956 12 uh 15 Grace is what brings us to God God Saves Us by grace and no man never sought God at any time the Bible said see we say I sought God I don't no didn't is God seeking you than Lord there's your journey of through just not just I just live like the devil I I can do anything and I'm still going to heaven now show me that in the prophet's message or the Bible see because you remember what I'm saying I didn't say I did not say that you're perfect and won't never do nothing but you show me where the Bible ever justifies what's done what is done has to be condemned whether it be Old Testament or new testament right right okay what happened to David and Bash Sheba yeah well look at that boy made it out now he said you'll pay y you'll pay always did he had a dead child but you see what I'm talking about yes see we talk about Grace Oh Brother D Grace is unmerited favor it don't matter what I do now show me that in the Bible in the point of saying that it doesn't matter what you do cuz remember how I preach a little different than maybe most people preach about salvation and things and but I preach it the way I believe it right I believe Mark 11 if you say to this mountain be moved but I believe it's based on about two verses below there then it says if you won't forgive you won't be forgiven all right well that's putting it on something you do or don't do no no no it's not don't worry about you're already done to done you done that anyway it's trying to get it straight but you see brother says Grace is what God did for me works is what I do for of God now watch him and they'll make a Doctrine out of it they think that works is what wins your merits if it is it isn't a free gift Grace is what God did for you by Grace you're saved and and works is what you do in appreciation of the grace that he showed to you amen cuz you see I know that we're saved by grace I know that and you don't do anything to get saved except except except the fact that you accept Jesus Christ right but now after you're saved our life is totally on conditions you said no no no no no you putting it's own conditions I saw a sign I've Pine gr I think it GS that says uh old age is what is what is the word in inable in other words it means it's going to come old age is going to come inev but said growth development you got something to do with it you got something to do with growth development all right but now think about what I'm saying brother random said on invisible Union the Bride of Jesus Christ 1965 11:27 that the Bride of Jesus Christ is wearing a b wedding bound of Grace B Band of Grace unmar of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slip the wedding band on you there put your name on the book what a Thanksgiving Hallelujah you see once you're born again your life then is on a conditional form because growth development has to do with life if we don't study God's word are we going to grow in it no you know if we don't read pray and study are we're going to grow in it i' be like telling child you don't need to eat you don't need to eat you're a child I don't think any of us have much problems with that we spend too much time eating but now think with me for a minute cuz I'm just trying to get to this point and we'll bring it to a close nothing we could do to Merit our Salvation am I back where started you're saved by grace nothing you could do to Merit that but when you get born again the growth development is dependent upon whether or not we'll eat God's word amen and if we don't eat his word then whose problem is it well like my brother said well it don't matter to me Sam I just want to go to heaven good point but see that's a good old Baptist way of seeing it you I just want to go to heaven well I told you a long time ago I quit trying to go to heaven I believe Heaven's coming here and see if we're not in that channel in that word to where God can come down and reveal himself to us we if we don't study he can't reveal it right and and then if we even take it as studying after somebody that has taught us wrong how can God reveal that to us that's right right right I mean we're taught wrong God can't reveal wrong word that's right amen well he'll just come down when he wants to and straighten me out no might not be we got a lot to do with it right amen I know I sound funny you say well well brother Dale you sound like you're saying that that salvation is totally of God but then you turn around and sound like you're saying that we got something to do with it I told you how many times already I told you after you're born again after you're born again you do have something to do with your growth development right right amen cuz that way you're in a journey traveling through faith and the Bible says that what the faith to Faith from Revelation to revelation meaning that we're in a journey so you're Save By Grace what through faith right through the Journey you travel you know sometimes it's not too good of a journey I mean it' be nice if every day that if go God would come down like he did in the cool of of the evening in the garden and talk to Adam and Eve be nice to just talk to God every day you I I don't get that opportunity and I know it's my problem and I don't mean I don't pray I just mean that it's my problem sometimes that God can't talk to me cuz you see I get my mind on something else in some other form it's hard for him to do it we have to live in life and that's fine we we live and we work we do you know but are you understanding what I'm saying we're in a journey folks the Christian journey is a traveling through faith amen so everybody saved by by Grace but we're saved by grace through faith yes and we got in a journey and we're responding responsible in that journey I mean we go out and we do something wrong the prophet of God said what he said you sent us in as a Christian what did he say he said you're going to reap a tub fo that's right right well I'm saved well go argue with him about the tub being dumped on you just remember the TB being D on you because you needed it dumped that's what to say it right we don't want it turned over the tub you see I'm just trying to get you to see true Grace am now why wouldn't we you know why wouldn't we want to be to where that when we talk to God and all to not try and I was listening we was last night cuz I I've been studying on this for a little bit and uh we're listening to the message of Grace and I'd invite you to to listen to that one and to read the adoption series that would be good because you know in all of that your Prophet is explaining real true Grace you know and he says there's not a thing you can do to Merit what God does that's right there's no such thing as trying to get on the good side with God there's no brownie points right you know there's no try to do good right no but just automatically be what you are right I mean I worked at General Motors I had a job and these brothers knowed it was you know was all on assembly lines and yeah I had an opportunity cuz I was the oldest ranking in the the uh pool and I could pretty well pick my job but instead of that I would take some of the hard jobs and run them that day let somebody else I've actually went up to people and just told them said just go take a break and get gone for a while I'll run your job Lord come back in an hour or so why because it's just me mhm I mean that's just the way I am I've never thought that because of me being what I am is supposed to make me something special I am something special he made me that and I try to live the life of Christ always did it work or whether it be anywhere where us hunting whatever we're doing it's always this the same life right amen yeah why wouldn't it be why would I want to be something here that's what they always said it work said we don't understand how a preacher can Pastor can work with his congregation CU about seven of us work together there every day you know well that didn't bother me I should ask them am I any different when I'm up in the pool pit than I am here living every day with you but you understand what I'm talking about if you're a Christian you don't have to make yourself do things it's a pleasure to well I just when people tell me I just I just get my righteous indignation right I just I just want to release well go out as brother Tom used to say I wish he here today need all amen well brother Tom me and him would get on to something you know and he didn't didn't maybe like it or didn't figure it out real good and and uh he'd be gone for a day or two cuz every day he'd bring me my breakfast he'd always be there work with me day in and day out right on the line you know I mean just come right by every day I got a big old slab of biscuit I mean a big Texas toast sandwich you know with couple of three or four eggs and and big old strink of lean all on the and a cup of coffee but when it get kind of down something get tied on him brother Tom would disappear for a while well when he come back I'd say Tom where you been I've been out y there butting my head against that column I never did go out there and look but I could just see that column you know how big those columns they're not little Med ones now great big columns a to building but I could just see that column as it went up and went over like this and a great big bend just to fit his head bo bo you know he said I've been out there beating my head against that column but you know what he got St right y whether it was me beating on his head or him beating on the column one of the two got it straight and he'd come back and I know I all in me but see why can't we be Christian folks is it a drudgery to be a Christian is it a problem being a Christian no I enjy enjoy it amen I enjoy being a Christian do you have your bad days yeah but I ain't going to let you know it right well I said yesterday said when you're out here running over there and waited went to the deer hunting land she said you're wore out I no I'm not and I wasn't but you know what I can do I I'm in bad sh I'm in bad sh everything going wrong well you know what I won't be long I'll be in bad shape that's but instead of that I'm happy I'm happy to be a Christian I'm happy to be what I am and that's all I want to do is just be a Christian saved by grace through faith I'm in a journey and I'm traveling through that faith and I realize that there's nothing I can do to Merit it I did didn't Merit him calling me but you know what he's called a lot of people is that scripture many are called but few are chosen well now you know what that mean that that means that brother collie he looks good you know but brother dick he don't look too good so I choose him because I like the good and he he gave me a little poke little money in there you know yeah no that's not what it means folks that's right that's not the way it is that's right he doesn't choose by what he likes no he chooses by his for knowledge to know what you'll do we're not going to pull anything over on him but do you understand what I'm saying I'll try to quit that you said we're saved by grace but put the rest up with it cuz everybody's saved by grace but you accept it and it becomes true Faith instead of by that's good instead of just being something you're living yourself it becomes a journey of life but you have a wonderful thing I don't understand it I can't I can't comprehend when I was in the Baptist we went to church I can't comprehend that's one thing I don't understand is how people can miss church I don't understand that I I can't understand it because it's never been with my wife and I you know are we going to church Sunday I've never done that in the Baptist well so and so said is coming tell them not to come on Sunday that's right but you know you going to hurt feelings brother Dale well who going to hurt you are God right amen amen amen that's right but you say well that's the only time we get to see them well that's all right then that's the only time I ever get to see my family is I got to lay out a church to see them that I won't see them that's right they're the one making the choice not me especially if they're in this message then now you're Ming okay okay I'll quit meddling but by grace are you saved through faith that's right there's no problem with everybody that's in the same journey is it you know the trouble they had with the people in the Bible was who children of Israel had them you know what it says about it mixed multitude mixed multitudes when it got them always messed up he said what's a mixed multitude mixed multitude is just exactly what it is a multitude is mixed up that's not following the truth that's right but where are we are we just saved by grace or is it by grace through faith if it is then it's a wonderful Journey amen come on brother a wonderful Journey to be able to be a Christian to be a Christian the little arm bands they have you know what would Jesus do what would he do in this day a journey he was in a journey he just didn't live by faith he lived through faith this thing he was in a journey we're in a journey It's a Wonderful opportunity to be in a journey to follow through into that journey and just try to live this see real true Grace well it just don't make no difference what I do I'll be saved anyway now if you got that idea you're lost I don't mind saying that I find where the Prophet set it for you if you'd like it so if you take that attitude it proves you're not saved to start with right but faith is a revelation brother what we 120 in the red book 120 in the red book anybody has a need the blessed calling me in you be bring me every to me will give you are you in a journey are you just climing to be a Christian are you just St in the room salvation is of the Lord but we must accept that for us then he can make it give you rest take my y me and for I let me it I open I heard a on the mountain dark sh St Hing to me about it I will give you I me and for ibody have I give and I have you by temp h a sense of me Christ will sanctify you if you in the holy spirit will give you me I will give you rest my me and be bless and we TR my now just let him play one while we listen to it all right I hope all of you can hear the horn why we say then come me I will give you take my upon you me every I am and come my you amen and amen amen but are you living or you believe you're just saved by grace or are you saved by grace through faith through a revelation through a life an understanding a walk a lot of difference in the two true Grace is truly unmar favor that's right nobody in the world has ever deserved anything but yet he come down to save everybody what about that that he come down to save everybody but everybody won't want it they don't want it they wouldn't have it some walk a little while and then her journey gets rough they fall off to see some just keep on going and enter into the joys of the Lord now see it's to those that have stayed with the word take on these things father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace we thank you for the day and we know that this has been kind of an odd little message but Lord we just want all of us to see one thing that if the world is saved by grace then Lord we want to be through faith we want to walk in the journey we want to be there that's right then we know and realize that a lot of people will never accept you as their savior but that still don't mean that you didn't pay the price that's amen lord it's not anything we could do or not do that would make it any greater but oh Lord what a wonderful opport opportunity to be able to want to walk in you and to fellowship with you while we're in near this world and to realize you're not up in heaven that you're here dwelling with us have your way now guid us be with the people on the way high home give everybody a safe journey we love you and commit it all to you in Jesus name amen remember the service is Wednesday Brothers Joe excuse me we got Saturday coming up right yeah Saturday we're going to nursing home and see by the time 10 a.m. anybody want going to be what 10:00 10:00 10:00 everybody understand if you want to go we'll all go down and we'll have a good time singing and fellowshipping
