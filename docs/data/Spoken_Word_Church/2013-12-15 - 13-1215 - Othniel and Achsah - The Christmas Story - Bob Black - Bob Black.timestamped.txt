[0:03] all right
[0:07] number 21.
[0:10] numbers 21.
[0:17] now we're getting along towards the
[0:19] Christmas season so I wanted to go to a
[0:22] Christmas story so this is kind of an
[0:24] odd Christmas Story
[0:28] a different way
[0:34] so before we start reading let's just go
[0:37] to Lauren Prairie
[0:38] George Jesus we thank you for your grace
[0:40] to us for another day to serve you Lord
[0:42] and I pray God that you'll just be with
[0:44] us today and be with the services and
[0:46] this little lesson Lord that you'll open
[0:47] your word to our hearts Lord granted
[0:50] Lord that you'll be with brother Wayne
[0:51] as he ministers and all the other ones
[0:53] that are absent today Lord that you'll
[0:55] just lower any any needs that we have
[0:57] Lord that you'll touch us Lord and
[0:59] remember us Lord today we pray in the
[1:01] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03] so
[1:06] now you know the Christmas story a lot
[1:08] of people around this time will put
[1:10] Jesus in the manger we set up the little
[1:12] mangers and things and and remember him
[1:14] as a little baby but his the the reason
[1:17] that he came as a little baby was
[1:19] because there was a purpose to his life
[1:24] thank you
[1:27] um
[1:28] so the the purpose to his life was uh
[1:31] was something greater than just just
[1:32] laying in a manger and we don't want to
[1:35] remember him as just to uh there was a
[1:39] Even in our walk we we go through we
[1:42] have a starting point and and something
[1:44] that's that we're walking towards and uh
[1:47] so the Christmas story is not just about
[1:50] a little baby late and a Manger but it's
[1:53] about uh the the purpose of his life
[1:57] and so the whole purpose of his life
[2:00] kind of starts back here in numbers 21 I
[2:02] think this sometimes in the Old
[2:04] Testament these little stories and
[2:05] things kind of open up uh
[2:08] open up help us to understand a little
[2:10] bit better what's um
[2:13] things that we that we see in the New
[2:16] Testament so let's just read over here
[2:18] in numbers 21 of the fifth chapter the
[2:21] people spake against God and against
[2:23] Moses
[2:25] wherefore have you brought us up out of
[2:28] Egypt to die in the wilderness
[2:31] from there is no bread neither is there
[2:33] any water
[2:34] and our soul Louis this light bread
[2:39] God had been raining down bread from
[2:42] putting bread out there for them to
[2:44] gather every morning and all they had to
[2:45] do was just step out and they began to
[2:47] lose it and you know program talked
[2:49] about how that little that bread tasted
[2:51] like honey it was so sweet and it was uh
[2:54] it was nourishment from God and Jesus
[2:56] said I am that bread that that was tied
[2:59] back in there in the Old Testament that
[3:01] came from God out of Heaven to feed you
[3:03] and uh
[3:05] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[3:08] blood you'll have no part with me again
[3:09] he said all these things and they began
[3:11] to murmur against that bread there was a
[3:14] type of the bread of life that can't
[3:16] would come in in that little manger
[3:18] would come from God out of heaven and
[3:20] lay there in an unexpected way a little
[3:23] baby laying in in that Manger
[3:25] and they began to murmur against the
[3:27] bread just like you can take this all
[3:29] the way back to the Garden of Eden just
[3:31] like that uh in in the Garden of Eden
[3:34] God came down as his own Messenger to
[3:37] Adam and Eve and brought the word
[3:39] directly to them and they they instead
[3:42] of leaning on God's message he decided
[3:45] went out and took a little something
[3:47] extra and here they are at murmuring
[3:50] against the word of God the bread of
[3:51] life that came from God out of heaven
[3:53] and the Lord sent fiery serpents among
[3:56] the people and they bit the people that
[3:59] most people of Israel died because of
[4:01] what they did in the Garden of Eden we
[4:04] were all bitten by the serpent what
[4:06] happened in the Garden of Eden how Satan
[4:08] was able to inject himself by taking one
[4:11] word off of God's word and inject
[4:12] himself into the human race and now
[4:15] we're all uh every every sin every heart
[4:18] they give her trouble was caused by that
[4:22] and
[4:24] you know I I was listening to brother
[4:26] Brandon talking about how you think we
[4:28] think that um
[4:30] see they got one word off one word off
[4:34] and the program was talking about how
[4:36] you think that the Devil Comes will
[4:38] appear with a with a pointy tail and and
[4:41] uh horns on his head and that kind of
[4:43] thing but how does he appear in this day
[4:46] how does he appear he appears in a suit
[4:50] behind the pulpit now that's his word
[4:52] exactly he appears in a suit behind the
[4:55] pulpit and I I was uh just looking at a
[4:58] little form over the weekend on the
[5:00] internet where a message believer is
[5:02] getting talking and I was just observing
[5:05] I just sit back and watch that there's
[5:06] this brother in in South Carolina and I
[5:09] won't name his name but he was putting
[5:10] it all out there that he had been in the
[5:12] message for 50 years
[5:14] and now he's beginning to have doubts
[5:16] that he's believing the right thing now
[5:18] do you think all these 50 years he's
[5:20] been preaching and standing behind the
[5:21] pulpit and I you know I would never say
[5:23] nothing bad about his brother but he's
[5:25] he's saying it out of his own mouth that
[5:28] he's coming up that he's beginning to
[5:30] have a doubt that this is really true
[5:32] but this is the truth now that is a
[5:35] fiery serpent that invites the people
[5:37] and injects in their minds the womb of
[5:40] their mind something that's contrary to
[5:42] God's word and they're bitten and you
[5:45] gotta have you got to have an antidote
[5:47] and the antidote is the full word the
[5:49] bread of life that came down out of
[5:51] heaven
[5:51] when that bread of life
[5:55] yeah yes
[5:59] was laying there in a Manger
[6:01] and I um
[6:03] we were coming over this morning Monica
[6:05] was sharing with some some notes that
[6:07] she had printed out she she went out she
[6:10] found some things like she was just
[6:11] doing a little real simple next week
[6:12] this morning for her little little
[6:14] kitties and she found some little notes
[6:16] that this church had had uh a
[6:18] denominational church had on some things
[6:21] about the the manger and whatnot but it
[6:24] was interesting how they
[6:25] almost had they they could see that one
[6:29] of their little bullet points was that
[6:30] that this little boy in the manger was
[6:33] God in flesh and how you know that's
[6:36] about more than what many people that
[6:39] proclaimed to preach the message are are
[6:41] preaching today is they say that that
[6:43] man in the manger was not God that he
[6:45] wasn't God until the River Jordan and
[6:47] that's a fiery Circle but
[6:50] um you know a lot of these little types
[6:52] in the Old Testament uh you can look at
[6:54] them in many ways you can't you know run
[6:56] around tell us not to just put a period
[6:58] behind anything don't say it now I've
[7:00] got it so you this fiery serpent
[7:02] represents many different things it
[7:04] represents the sin that it was
[7:06] interjected in the human race it
[7:08] represents this false doctrine that
[7:10] people are putting into the hearts and
[7:11] minds of the people
[7:13] and then therefore the people came to
[7:16] Moses and said we have sinned for we
[7:18] have spoken against the Lord and against
[7:20] thee pray unto the Lord that he take
[7:22] away the serpents from us and Moses
[7:24] prayed for the people
[7:26] and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a
[7:28] fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and
[7:32] it shall come to pass that everyone that
[7:34] is bitten when you look upon it shall
[7:36] live now there's what that little baby
[7:39] in the manger came to do he came to take
[7:41] on all of the Take On The Inheritance
[7:44] that Adam and Eve had given us which was
[7:46] death and give us a new inheritance
[7:49] which was life he came to take on
[7:51] everything that we had everything that
[7:53] was held against us and become sin and
[7:56] be lifted up so that all men could be
[7:58] drawn to him and be saved any man that
[8:00] had been bitten and Moses made a serpent
[8:03] of brass and put it up pole and it came
[8:06] to pass that if a serpent had bitten any
[8:08] man when he beheld The Serpent of brass
[8:10] he lives and the children of Israel set
[8:13] forward and pitched and Oba
[8:16] now this
[8:19] the journey in Israel that they had they
[8:21] were they wound up in this place in in
[8:23] uh in uh
[8:26] in the wilderness where this little
[8:28] story took place but this story took
[8:31] place that that their Journey started at
[8:34] the same place our journey starts their
[8:37] Journey started back in Exodus the first
[8:40] Stakes of this when Moses came and
[8:43] introduced them to that pointed out what
[8:45] they needed to do to be saved and they
[8:47] had a prophet that told them that pulled
[8:49] away to a lamb you need to put the
[8:52] Lamb's blood over the door of your house
[8:54] and they put the Lamb's blood over the
[8:56] door and their Journey started and it
[8:58] started in such a way that God said this
[9:00] this is such a starting point that I'm
[9:03] going to rewrite your calendar I'm going
[9:05] to change your calorie and it says there
[9:07] in Exodus that he started their calendar
[9:09] in the months I'll be here because that
[9:11] is the time that their Journey began
[9:15] and
[9:16] so your journey starts with the blood
[9:19] too you first have to come under the
[9:21] blood you know that was three brothers
[9:22] talked about how there were three
[9:24] exoduses in the Bible the first Exodus
[9:26] was started by Moses that introduced
[9:29] them to the lamb that poured them to the
[9:30] lamb and they had to put that blood over
[9:32] the little of their door and the second
[9:34] Exodus was John on the River Jordan that
[9:37] pointed the pointed into the lamb Moses
[9:40] had a pillar of fire and John had a
[9:42] pillar of fire that fire came down out
[9:43] of heaven and landed on the a period
[9:46] over Jesus's head and he identified the
[9:48] lamb and led the people from from their
[9:52] old ideas the ideas that they had uh
[9:55] their own conceptions and things and
[9:58] pointed him to a New Testament and then
[10:01] in this day we've got a new x a Third
[10:03] Exodus where we have a prophet too that
[10:06] points us to a risen Christ with the
[10:10] pillar of fire and leads us to leads us
[10:12] to the to the to the same to that bread
[10:15] of life that came down out of heaven
[10:16] that leads us to his word being revealed
[10:18] in US
[10:20] and that every believer I remember
[10:23] brother Wade a few years ago preached
[10:25] that sermon uh three pulls of your
[10:27] journey how did every believer has has
[10:29] uh goes through a process of Journey
[10:32] that starts from believing be uh get
[10:36] getting covered by the blood and then
[10:38] you know uh back in 1954 brother Brown
[10:41] preached those three sermons Redemption
[10:43] by Blood
[10:44] how did they were they were Redeemed by
[10:46] blood that that blood that was over the
[10:48] little of their door and then they came
[10:50] they were running from favor they came
[10:52] to the to the Dead Sea
[10:54] and now they needed another Redemption
[10:56] they needed Redemption not by Blood but
[10:58] by power and the power of the Holy Ghost
[11:01] came down the power of that pillar fire
[11:02] came down and part of the Red Sea has
[11:05] swallowed up all their enemies and then
[11:06] LED them Victorious but there's their
[11:09] Redemption still wasn't complete
[11:11] they still had to go on a journey and
[11:14] they still had to come and cross over
[11:16] the uh the Jordan River and then he
[11:19] preached another sermon after that on
[11:21] the Redemption in completeness and joy
[11:23] because just because you've been uh look
[11:26] at this uh statue of perfect man when
[11:28] you're back when you're born again
[11:30] you're at the foundation but that's not
[11:33] the completeness of your Redemption you
[11:34] have an Earnest of your of your
[11:36] salvation but you continue on in a
[11:38] journey as these as your inheritance is
[11:41] made manifest in you
[11:43] your inheritance
[11:45] your inheritance is is becomes real in
[11:48] your life you're you get virtue and
[11:50] knowledge all these things that are
[11:51] written in God's word that are part of
[11:54] his inheritance part of what he did for
[11:56] you that he died on the cross so that
[11:57] you could have these things and not just
[12:00] these but healing in your body and one
[12:02] day your body will be changed that's
[12:04] part of your inheritance
[12:06] so that's why
[12:07] I want to go to um Joshua
[12:16] let's see Joshua
[12:19] 14.
[12:33] Joshua chapter 14.
[12:43] now Joshua was an interesting book to
[12:45] the believer and brogram taught us that
[12:47] it compared it parallels Ephesians
[12:49] because in the book of Ephesians Paul
[12:52] laid out for the church there
[12:53] inheritance in Ephesians he tells us
[12:56] that there are some Apostles and some
[12:57] some are given Apostles some are given
[12:59] prophets some are giving teachers and so
[13:01] forth and because he's placing out
[13:03] you're inheritance he's saying these
[13:05] people
[13:06] or are given for this purpose you have a
[13:08] purpose and then he he goes on and says
[13:11] wives obey your husbands and so forth
[13:13] wives have a part to do husbands have a
[13:15] part to do children he talks about
[13:17] children he's placing everybody and
[13:19] putting them into their their
[13:21] predestinated their place in life
[13:24] putting them into your inheritance
[13:27] putting you where God wants you to be
[13:29] and Joshua does the same thing with when
[13:32] uh when the children of Israel crossed
[13:33] over the Jordan River Joshua which types
[13:36] the Holy Ghost began to place the
[13:38] children of Israel into their
[13:39] inheritance now remember brother and
[13:42] taught how that
[13:43] um
[13:43] when when those uh mother the mothers
[13:47] cried out uh Leah and Rachel in
[13:51] childbirth that she prophesied where it
[13:54] and those labor pains prophesied where
[13:56] those children were going to be placed
[13:58] positionally when they got to the
[14:00] promised land
[14:03] and so we can see in the Book of Joshua
[14:05] when they get to the promised land
[14:06] Joshua the Holy Spirit begins to Plate
[14:09] Place them put them positionally where
[14:11] they should be
[14:12] then the children in Joshua chapter 14
[14:15] verse 6.
[14:17] but then the children of Judah came unto
[14:19] Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of
[14:22] jafana the kid as I said unto him thou
[14:25] knowest the thing that the Lord said
[14:26] unto Moses the man of God concerning me
[14:28] and thee and kadish barnia and he goes
[14:31] on and talking in verse 8 he says
[14:32] because I wholly follow the Lord my God
[14:35] he's telling you he's reminded him you
[14:36] know how how that he followed the kadish
[14:39] Garnier he didn't depart from the word
[14:40] that was promised to them and and when
[14:42] they went over and saw the land it was
[14:45] promised by God to Caleb and Joshua that
[14:48] this land where wherever you touched
[14:50] your feet I'm going to give it to you it
[14:52] was that was their inheritance and the
[14:54] land of the Believers not just it it's
[14:57] all the promises in the Bible everything
[14:59] that God has promised to you and your
[15:01] flesh your flesh is Tied by that land
[15:04] you know because God has promised that
[15:06] one day he's going to change our mortal
[15:07] bodies to be like his he'll change our
[15:10] bodies and he'll change the whole earth
[15:11] he'll purify it by by fire and cleanse
[15:14] it of everything that's not righteous
[15:16] now back down in verse 12. yeah when
[15:20] he's Josh Caleb was getting his
[15:22] inheritance now therefore give me this
[15:24] mountain where where of the Lord's
[15:25] thinking that day for thou heard us in
[15:27] that day how the anakims were there and
[15:29] that the cities were great and fenced if
[15:31] so be the Lord will be with me then I
[15:33] shall be able to drive them out as the
[15:35] Lord said
[15:36] and Joshua blessed him and gave unto
[15:38] Caleb the son of jafona Hebron for an
[15:40] inheritance
[15:41] man Hebrew is important because that is
[15:43] where Abraham met God in Genesis Chapter
[15:46] 18 and Genesis chapter 17 is the type of
[15:49] Abraham receiving the Holy Ghost walk
[15:51] before me and be thou perfect God told
[15:53] Abraham and in Genesis Chapter 18 then
[15:56] Abraham came and told a god came to
[15:59] Abraham and told him the secrets the
[16:01] secret Mysteries uh revealed to him the
[16:04] secret of what was going to happen to
[16:05] Sodom and Gomorrah and began to reveal
[16:07] open to him The Seekers and that's what
[16:09] happens to the True Believer you go
[16:11] through justification of sanctification
[16:12] the baptism the Holy Ghost and then the
[16:14] God begins to open his word to you and
[16:16] make it manifest to you and Joshua
[16:19] blessed him
[16:20] I gave on the Cave of the son of jeopona
[16:22] Hebrew inferred inheritance Hebrew
[16:24] therefore became the inheritance of
[16:25] Caleb the son of jafana the kennesite
[16:27] unto this day because of he wholly
[16:29] followed the Lord God of Israel so he
[16:32] inherited the place where Abraham walked
[16:34] with God and then over in uh in the next
[16:37] chapter chapter 15.
[16:45] verse 14.
[16:47] chapter 15 verse 14.
[16:52] and Caleb and this is really what I'm
[16:54] getting to you and Caleb drove three
[16:57] sons of anak shishai and ahiman and
[16:59] Talma and the children of manic but he's
[17:02] driving out I believe this is kind of
[17:04] typing that he's driving out that
[17:06] trinitarian Doctrine and and restoring
[17:08] that there's just one God he's bringing
[17:10] one God back to this old Pagan land and
[17:13] he went up this to the inhabitants of
[17:15] Deborah in the name of Deborah is the
[17:17] Old Testament that the Hebrew word for
[17:19] the Oracle or the holy of holy the holy
[17:22] place and this city was called deeper
[17:24] but before it had another name and it
[17:26] was called before it was called Bieber
[17:28] it was called courgette Seifer
[17:31] and Caleb said he the smileth kerjaf see
[17:35] for and taketh it to him will I give oxa
[17:38] my daughter to wife
[17:40] so now here we've got we've got a type
[17:43] uh we've got Caleb
[17:47] telling his little uh the younger man
[17:51] if you go take this city then what I
[17:54] will give to you is a wife I'll give you
[17:57] a bride
[17:58] now you know there's a lot of times in
[18:01] the Old Testament where uh when David
[18:03] went up to Goliath he he there was
[18:06] something that he would get for for
[18:08] defeating Goliath the the reward for
[18:11] defeating Goliath wasn't just honor and
[18:14] fame but the reward he got for defeating
[18:16] Goliath was he got a bride he got Saul's
[18:19] daughter that was promised If any man
[18:21] can defeat this this man he'll get a
[18:23] bride now the reward that Jesus got when
[18:27] he defeated Goliath on the cross was he
[18:30] got a bride that's what he that's that's
[18:32] what the reward was and so now think
[18:36] about this when off Neil went to courage
[18:38] at cepher here's the value that he
[18:41] placed on that city was the value that
[18:44] he saw in Ox AXA
[18:47] he looked at oxen and see he said I this
[18:49] is the kind of person that I want to be
[18:52] my wife and he put He took the value of
[18:55] this woman and he put that on care Jeff
[18:58] cefer the value that he saw encourage
[19:00] that Seaford in taking that CD was what
[19:03] he saw in that woman and I believe
[19:05] that's what when Jesus was on the cross
[19:07] dying for our sins he what the value
[19:10] that he put in in all of the agony and
[19:13] the soul that he went through was the
[19:15] value that we have to him he looked out
[19:17] and saw he looked beyond
[19:19] and saw us and saw that all of that
[19:23] would be worth it because he would get
[19:24] us he would get a bride somebody that
[19:27] would would uh manifest what was back
[19:30] there in Genesis
[19:36] so you know
[19:39] AXA did the same thing you know she was
[19:42] looking for somebody that had value too
[19:44] she was looking for somebody that uh she
[19:47] was looking for a man that that her
[19:49] father Caleb would would regard as a
[19:52] real lion
[19:53] a line of the tribe of Judas and you
[19:57] know in in uh maybe look at this this
[20:00] declaration in in this way what Caleb
[20:03] says is there any man that can go and
[20:06] take this seat and it's really
[20:09] interesting to look at what these these
[20:11] names mean because
[20:13] othniel means the lion of Judah or or
[20:16] the lion and he you know he was part of
[20:19] the tribe of Judah so he he's you know
[20:21] typing the lion of the tribe of Judah
[20:23] and Kurt Josh safer means
[20:26] the city of the book now he's going to
[20:29] take the city of the book and when he
[20:31] takes the city of the book he gets a
[20:33] wife he gets a bride
[20:35] hahaha
[20:40] and off new
[20:44] the son of kidaz the brother of Caleb
[20:47] took it
[20:48] and he gave him oxa
[20:51] his daughter to wife
[20:54] and I'm going to finish this real quick
[20:57] that's his name
[20:59] What's that question that would be his
[21:01] niece
[21:02] that's right
[21:07] accent was Caleb's daughter and Caleb is
[21:11] off Neil's nephew uh uncle
[21:15] it was his
[21:17] nephew yeah
[21:21] and he gave him oxide his daughter to
[21:23] wife
[21:25] so let's look at this look at this this
[21:27] way who is worthy to take the book
[21:30] and then the line of the tribal Judah
[21:32] comes and takes the book
[21:33] and and he and he gets a wife and what
[21:38] does oxa mean oxa means
[21:41] uh bursting the Veil
[21:44] which is another way of saying the
[21:46] unveiling the unveil and you know uh I'm
[21:51] gonna finish on this
[21:52] their program preached the sermon the
[21:54] unveiling of God
[21:56] and I want to read some of these um here
[21:59] he's got his bride
[22:01] and I want to just read some of the
[22:03] things that brother Brown said in the
[22:04] unveiling with God and we'll finish and
[22:06] that now that's this is kind of an odd
[22:09] Christmas story but that's really what
[22:11] the Christmas story is that he came in a
[22:14] Manger to grow up to go through the
[22:17] trials of life
[22:19] to suffer through life and go through
[22:21] this journey just like the children of
[22:24] Israel went through a journey to get
[22:25] there in here because he went through a
[22:26] journey to get in his inheritance and we
[22:28] go through a journey to get our
[22:30] inheritance the trials of life and
[22:32] things tribulation work of patience on
[22:34] up through the statue of perfect man
[22:37] and then he he got his inheritance and
[22:39] what was his inheritance his inheritance
[22:42] was I believe it was so much more than
[22:44] just his flesh it was his flesh and it
[22:47] was also a bride that would cut that
[22:49] came out of him on the on the cross with
[22:52] water blood and spirit so that we his
[22:54] bride could be made manifest so in the
[22:56] unveiling of God 1964 brother random
[22:58] said we in him then we being in him we
[23:03] are still veiled to the religionists and
[23:05] professors of the world
[23:07] see our Glory that we have and enjoying
[23:09] we are still veiled to them Outsiders
[23:11] they think we're crazy enough again to
[23:14] see see that's right but we who are in
[23:16] here in Christ baptized into him
[23:19] into him we are partakers of this Glory
[23:22] see but not on the outside you're still
[23:24] looking into denying it see so now we
[23:26] are invited into him to be partakers of
[23:29] all that he is we're invited into him
[23:31] which is hid the unbelievers by the veil
[23:33] of human flesh see they know that Glory
[23:37] they read of it it's in the word here
[23:38] the glory of God and things like that
[23:40] it's just the word for them to us it's a
[23:43] manifestation see it is no more word
[23:46] it's a reality
[23:48] now that's why AXA is the unveiling the
[23:52] bursting of The Veil The revealing who
[23:54] God is
[23:56] uh every some more the unveilable god
[23:59] 1964 paragraph 245. now it isn't just a
[24:02] written word to us it's a reality we are
[24:06] in him now we're enjoying now we Behold
[24:09] Him now he's seeing the word
[24:11] manifesting himself it's hid out there
[24:14] because why is veiled in human flesh
[24:17] where's this where's it Vale that's
[24:19] right
[24:20] oh they say that bunch of people where
[24:23] did they go to school what what
[24:25] education do they have where what what
[24:27] do they come from what group do they
[24:29] belong to see huh see they don't get it
[24:31] a man said to another man the other day
[24:33] said you have to belong to a
[24:35] denomination to be a Christian he said I
[24:38] am a Christian I don't belong to any of
[24:40] them said God taking this cancer out of
[24:43] me said now what do you think about it
[24:44] it was a doctor he said show me the
[24:46] denominations doing it see all right see
[24:48] it's still Veil where is it Veil
[24:52] now see see what I read numbers how that
[24:56] he took upon our sin he took upon he
[25:00] became us so that we could become him on
[25:02] that cross so that we could become
[25:04] unveiled uh he could become unveiled in
[25:07] US
[25:08] I don't want to I have nothing to unveil
[25:10] it's him coming unfailing us and uh you
[25:14] know because Adam what they did in the
[25:16] Garden of Eden he he lost the book he
[25:19] lost the right to produce Genesis 1 26
[25:22] 27 but now God came and took it back so
[25:25] that he could produce and now it's it's
[25:28] produced but it's veil to the world it's
[25:31] hidden behind a veil of Flesh and then
[25:34] I'm feeling of God 1964 paragraph 287
[25:37] notice Made Alive and today when the
[25:39] world is manifested in human vessels
[25:41] veils it's absolutely the word fulfilled
[25:45] in that day which comes back to God
[25:47] being baptized into him according to
[25:49] First Corinthians 12 we become
[25:51] identified with him
[25:54] he died to reveal himself to us now let
[25:57] us die to self to reveal him to others
[26:00] let us die to the traditions and things
[26:03] to reveal him to others die to the
[26:05] denominations to reveal him to others
[26:07] and I'll just finish with this but
[26:10] remember there is something in the old
[26:12] book that promised that there will be a
[26:14] predestinating ordained hand come one
[26:16] day that would pick it up and make the
[26:18] word of this book through a
[26:19] predestinated heart to the task that
[26:22] it's made for reveal the promises that's
[26:24] in it it might look oh like an old bunch
[26:27] of Holy Rollers or something other but
[26:29] just take the Master's Hand the word on
[26:32] it to reveal that word and it becomes
[26:35] more than a Holy Roller it becomes that
[26:38] to every one of us having it friends
[26:39] it's not a bunch of fanaticism
[26:43] it depends on Whose hand the bow is in
[26:45] he's talking about the master Fiddler
[26:46] that that can if he knows how to play it
[26:49] he can produce something amazing a real
[26:51] Masterpiece so that's uh I that's the
[26:55] real Christmas story it's not just that
[26:57] God came in a manger and that's the end
[26:59] of the story and you know the even the
[27:01] the when the wise men came the Magi came
[27:05] they testified of what he was going to
[27:08] do to claim his inheritance by by the
[27:12] gifts that they brought they brought
[27:13] gold frankincense some Merle which
[27:15] testifies of deity dedicating himself to
[27:17] death that he was dedicating himself to
[27:20] the task of bringing back that
[27:23] inheritance that was lost by Adam so
[27:26] we'll stop right there
