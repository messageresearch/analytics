========================================

that we're not worthy of anything whatsoever and father if we got what we deserve we wouldn't have anything yet you promised us and you've kept your word we love you and we thank you you brought your word unto us and now let your word do as it said said it would heal those that are sick among us and deliver the downhearted we love you and we thank you have your way forgive our sins bless wait in June and all the others era that are traveling back today coming back in home and just believe would be with each one we love you and we thank in Jesus name Amen John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and light shyness in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there's no way for light and darkness to dwell it's the same place but now let's come back we'll be we're dealing with the Garden of Eden and coming down and then we're coming to our day in time of where we're living so let's go to 1st Corinthians 11 that would to God you would bear with me a little wild in my folly and indeed by with me Framm jealous over you with godly jealousy for I have a spouse you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear now listen to what Paul way back garden when the church was on fire things were moving great things were taking place since but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ man and you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and as I said back dark Paul was concerned about the point of satan being able to do the same thing that he done in the garden remember we've we've been talking about the Garden of Eden and what took place and situations in the garden and I and trying to talk about what was the original sin and we know that the original sin is unbelief all right now they act are the things that take place after that brings into manifestation what those things that you've done see in other words Eve had to receive with in her mind the thought or concept that the devil was speaking to her about and then that was the worst part of it that's what's at death she received that in her mind she begin to reason on the Word of God all right and that set death into the spiritual part thereof Eve and then it brought in later to Adam and him receiving also and knowing what he's doing he had he still done what he done and and all like that and it brought it on into his part and where was it dealing at in the reasoning factors and that's what Paul was concerned about that the church could be you know tempted and things like that as well as Eve was so you referred back to that you know the show that that Satan would still do it so whatever the original sin is it's still now all right it's still here okay so the original sin was to disbelieve God's work well so is it today now the things that took place as I say whether you want to call it eaten an apple or whatever you want to call it we've been through that and know for sure D what the word covers of what took place but yet still the point is what took place was a display of the unbelief that she had okay so being the unbelief first then sees then she just went on and done what she done to manifest the in the reality as we call it as we say well not drinking gambling smoking running around with women etc is not sin you said well we've been taught all of our life that that's in now sin it's unbelief you do those things because you're an unbeliever right I mean that's the reason you do is because you're an unbeliever it's not because of you being some way or point it's the fact that you're not a believer because believers don't do those times see then there's were we covered then that attributes we deal with attributes a lot what took place that's our major thoughts instead of considering what took place before whatever you want to think happen think all right that was the unbelief that was in to Eve and we know for a certainty that she was a special person back there in their beginning and creation and and she didn't have a life that she lived and was daily bombarded by Satan in a room like you and I from childhood and coming up you know and the point she didn't have a bunch of time to you know come to a point all right so Satan he got to Eve and he began to get her to doubt God's Word Satan through the Beast speaking to Eve he said you know can we eat of every tree in the car she become a good woman preacher and as we say she begin to explain to him the word he said well is that wrong one ain't nothing wrong with trying to explain the word if you know the whole story but if you try to explain how if the story you know I mean it is supposed to be of course everything now not running like it's supposed to be but it used to be you know that you couldn't be a witness in court unless you was an eyewitness of something you know hearsay wasn't supposed to be used now you just use anything they won't use you know do what they won't do with it and the person could have not even been standing there you you you see it on the TV I get so tickled at it and you know or something like that watching and seeing news thing and and they'll have a lady or something like that especially a good size hefty one that's got a loud voice and why they pick them kind out I'm not I'm just telling you what the truth is you get upset with me for speaking it but you know yourself it's what they do they get a good loud mouth woman to explain what happened and she wasn't even there she didn't get burned until the police came she didn't get there until her the the news media arrived and then they pick her out to explain it that's life I don't I don't get them okay forgive me you think I'd do this I don't know I just tell it like it is and then you know we life and say forget it all right but listen then Eve as I said she told Satan was speaking through the Beast you understand the Beast was not a snake I mean we read the Bible for that it was a beast all right then he was made a snake by the curse I mean that's Bible not upon that on the ground shalt thou go and dust be thy meat so he was first to beast he who had have been talking to a snake she were talking to a beast that's what Darwin couldn't find the missing link if he could just read the Bible he would have known what to oblige he would have found that beast that could talk reason speak to Eve something happened that Satan was using that to try to contact her and look how smart he was he you know he didn't jump right in he let her explain it we see that got to catching into her and got into her heart and beings of life of herself but he was explaining it I've been over and over with you you know he was explaining the truth she had been told to multiply and replenish the earth the beast wouldn't tell in her a lie the lie was how it would take place or when it would take place and what was gonna do she was made to be a mother she was made for that reason and the point all right and then she did Satan knew that he could not contact her in her physical body because you're not going to do that with a woman over the world on it it has to be first into the mind then end of the body okay all right make it short and sweet but he couldn't conduct her in that and he couldn't contact her in her soul because that was pure and she was part of the Genesis 1:26 our place within her just like Adam all right so then there was only one place left and that was her spirit part of her that would cover the memory reason conscience affections and stuff like that because see that's what the world that we live in really this body has worked nothing the Bible says it's dead without the spirit to motivate it it can't do anything it doesn't you don't even remember anything the brain working but yet it's got to be a spirit control doing that to make it to where you can think on those things all right not a doctor or a scientist just plain common sense or talking about life and where we live okay so in her reasonings and things she began to accept that well that was what I was made for I was made to be a mother and this beast is explaining what Adam wouldn't explain but see it wasn't time for Adam to explain it and that was the problem she got ahead and that's what everybody wants to do now they want to have they won't have the great knowledge or something this is the age in time of knowledge in the natural and the spiritual all right why do you think you've got about four or five thousand different denominations is because of knowledge while you got two or three thousand different denominations in this message because of knowledge everybody's wanting knowledge instead of this being simple and plain and look at what we are that's the point I'm trying to get in whatever took place in the garden is still taking place now what Satan is still right now talking to you right okay I'm not a mind-reader and neither of I'm a prophet but how many of you in your mind right now I was thinking what in the world is he saying how many are you thinking well he could have said it a better way he could have done it this way he could do that away I mean none of your brain is cut off while I talk right I mean well now you go to sleep but still remember you can learn languages while you sleep so they must be part of that still working right you're getting my point the point is plain language Satan's doing the same thing right now that he was in the garden he's saying to you well there's a better way of doing this there's a different way of explaining it I'll explain it this way I don't know that's alright but you're not in here aren't you supposed to go to cut your computer off you know huh you ain't supposed to be calculating what should have been done or oh it'll be done or it could be done you're supposed to be listening to what is done because that's what causes people to do it that causes people to go off in their own ideas and thoughts we're gonna get on with this afternoon we're going to start a little simple thoughts about salvation salvation I want to make it as simple as we can ever even think about go through the Old Testament with it and show that they had a salvation to prove they had a salvation they had a place to go to when they died no Cole paradise bosom of Abraham now but getting to what we're talking about now the reasoning factor is the situation that exists in all of us and that is were Satan through his subtility as Paul said and it's over in Genesis that the beast was the most subtly like I said he wouldn't a wouldn't an add a snake he was a beast then he was made of snake read your Bible plain language crawled on the belly all right now that reasoning factor though said into the mind of Eve and what did it start doing you know the message you need to read it study it listen to it or the greatest battle ever fought in that message the Prophet is explaining the things that took place in the garden you know all right now in doing that he's explaining what happens as we try to reason and see what happened to Eve Satan through his subtility stopped up the flues of her thinking put her to a point of thinking of what she should be doing instead of just relaxing and enjoying and have a good time in the garden there's nowt to get up cook breakfast they didn't out to do the washing the thing you know them dirty words that people don't like you know work wash ooh you know they're not to do any of those things right in Jordan but instead of that really I guess the truth was she had too much time there's a brother in the message he was telling me one time you know how much how many times he had preached that week and and many times he had had traveled and and everything like that and I said you need a job and he said a job yeah you had too much time he said I preached so many times and I've traveled so many miles and they he didn't work you know and I said well I preached more services in you this week and I traveled more miles than you travel this week and I worked at General Motors which costed me at that time 12 hours a day traveling back and forth I said what you need isn't a job you got too much time I don't mind is what do we call it Devil's waa workshop right that's where we think well you know to the mind and the mind is not the soul of mankind it's the spirit of mankind because that's worth it the animal doesn't have that the animal has a spirit and he can reason to a certain degree in memory to a certain degree but he's not like a human being he can't think things out if he could he'd save him a lot of trouble but he builds his nest the same way he does everything the same has he done 6,000 years ago he just he has to adapt to time yeah you know but he doesn't learn to reason that's not the point yeah all right but the point I'm trying to get you see is when God had told Eve and Adam in Genesis 1:28 before they were put into human flesh in 2:7 read your Bible go read it he told him to multiply and replenish the earth what's the eve knew that she knew that she was to do that but she didn't know when she probably had some concepts by looking around at life and the animals and things she had some concepts of things she wasn't just a dummy you know yet cause he had a concept but yet she had no way to understand how that would take blood because Adam had not explained it to her but if she did she begin to think about you know God promised that God promised that that's a promise in God's Word to multiply and replenish there wasn't anything wrong with the way of doing it it was the way it was done because God told her to do that it was an oncoming promise the Prophet said spoken words reading on city also said Eve would have have brought forth that child you know what he says in the spoken words original seed that he Isaiah sure to come through the wound of Eve now that's getting pretty strong and he said well no this no no no no no you're doing it in your underwear you just do what you want to I'm just preaching but when God told them to do that get the point she remembered that and when the beasts begin to tell her what was she was made for and they're trying to keep this from you boy that's the worst thing in the world to tell I'm not I'm gonna say it right that's the worst case in the world to tell anybody not just women I don't beat on women to say the women they are a thousand times easier to see and saw them on order know better because he had a thousand oh but the point I'm getting that you tell people I got something right here oh I'm taking a little bit well they ain't heard anything what you're doing do you get to what you got right here right and the worst thing in the world a lot of times you walk up to somebody and say I won't do it me I'll do her brother Kali cuz I trust him with I walk up to him I say brother Kali are you sick no I said well you're looking a little pale well they're not I forget it forget it go on forget it about 30 minutes later he's going to quit care right he made himself sick over what you say it so then the worst thing in the world I don't mean it wrong to garden he knows was for God to withhold from Eve what she was going to be now God forgive me for that statement appointed I believe he understands God he knew that if he withheld that that was was gonna be the problem it was gonna be that way okay by not telling her the whole story he's what made her do the things she done I'm trying to just keep it down right now the world we're at and see that the same devil is right here now reasoning with us about everything that he was back to her so don't look at it as a different scale of situation look at it of the fact let's see if Eve knew and we know the Bible said to her that she was to one day fulfill the promise of God and myself was the devil that's what I've tried to get you to see I've tried to be simple with you you know the preachers wants to make it a great thing a great mystery that you can't understand I thought the Christ was hidden and revealed in simplicity you know what I'll make it as simple as I can you know what pizza is - deep deep of what he's he nothing deep about what we've just been talking about is it not this sense about what we've been talking about this morning now what something deep about that I'm not trying to hide nothing I'm just trying to tell you the same devil was back dark is the same devil right now talking to you and to me cuz you know what he's telling me in people don't only hear that why don't you shut up go on cut it off gonna quit got company don't bring this right directly yeah he's in my mind is rolling it real good but I tried my best to get him out of there and sometime you know it helps a little but still okay we're just human okay Eve couldn't wait for God to fulfill his word why are they so many different churches in the world off of one Bible well I'm not talking about there I'm preaching here why is there so many different versions of this message of one message has to be the reasoning factors of mankind and that reasoning factor C is the most powerful element there is the Bible says the imagination of man's mind is continually evil do you realize where we have been you realize that when I was seven years old I was plowing a mule out in the field I swear you people overseas I hope they catch this and listening some of this hearing I've been two or three places you go there and you just listen to them and they're thinking oh we went to Jamaica one time and and they believe money grows on trees you know one of them says don't you have a green card I'm excuse me a gold card so don't you have a gold card I mean I was out in the in a market there in talking with people and and he said come here said don't you have a gold card I've got one it's got the name gold on it and then it's gold colored I said what do you mean he said I told you he's telling it up I told you they had gold cards he thought I had a 24 karat gold card and I carried around in my pocket I guess go see they just can't comprehend what it's like to show you one thing brother Brady you remember him he'd come over here and he'd been over here and in in the summertime sometime anything that's normal here got in Jamaica you know they don't have a lot of seasons and in it I mean it just stays warm out huh and stuff grows out here and he came back in the wintertime when all the leaves was gone and he was kind of out of it till he seemed not coming into to Ruth and when he did he looks and there's no ladies on the trees he's into brother hey what happened I've come to fire burnt the leaves off the trees and didn't burn the houses because they don't have shed and leaves they stay green all year round you say well that seal it no it's not silly when you brought up under an atmosphere and the things and and motivated by that see that's the way we are religiously you tell me so it didn't bother me back there when when I was in denomination I come out of it I got rid of that and it didn't bother me first statement I made in church in Gainesville Georgia I said God got me out of the denomination now I want him to get this denomination out of me because see we're born and raised at away alright we're born and raised with them things in us you could say we don't believe in the Trinity and that old demon II still right there they're trying to deceive you they're just slicker than the others and they're trying to deceive you because it really is three college you know I mean you explain Father Son Holy Ghost you understand the devil is still here to doing today what he's always done that's got into the man in his mind and and perverted him even born-again Christians remember Paul was not riding to lost people Paul was writing to Christians in Corinthians the Bible is not written to the sinner it's written to them that are in Christ Jesus well who you ins not read the sinner can read it yeah but it's not to him and Paul was telling the Christians Satan is coming he told them later that they would be false prophets and things come and deceive many and look what happened down to the dark ages and time till they come out of it there is no such thing Trinity taught in the Bible then they come out of it in a dark age and started teaching the Trinity and got the people deceived today with that Trinity the lady said one time sin said Sam don't believe in the Holy Trinity no I don't believe in the Holy Trinity code ain't no trend he said father son Holy Ghost that's not a Trinity I'm a father I'm a sudden I'm a human and my three people know I'm three different manifestation yeah we believe in many manifestations of God you got seven compound names the Old Testament Jehovah Jireh G over a four job with this canoe coming through the Old Testament but each one of them is expressing something about God for the time but none of them is the different from the other as a different God the Bible says there's one Lord the Ten Commandment starts out with what what is the first I believe I don't know other gods before me but yet we've been taught all of our lives these things until we believe it but Satan has to clean that out he didn't have to it took him a while to pervert even her thinking with you and I were born the wrong thinking that's the way we was born the Bible says were born in sin shapen in iniquity spouts my mother's wound a liar you don't like to think about it because look at the baby there and it's just born and you'll get into the lose the baby lives long enough he's gonna be a liar he's oh no not my baby let me get about two years old and I'm cooking when I and smeared all over his face and you asked it said you need to cook it uh-huh but it's all over them but you see we've been taught all of our lives certain things you explained to me as the people down on the other side of the earth hanging upside down well you're crazy emma is that one of their eyeballs go get Nina you're silly no plain language we're hanging in space this world stopped and everything gopher those are spinning of it creates the gravity something huh listen Church you said what are you trying to get at I'm trying to get it one time in the deception of Eve she was anointed you remember that in the last part we was striking it right in the end of the message she was anointed anointed in her spirit the devil anointed her in her spirit not her body not her soul but in her spirit that's what he's doing right now if you're born again Christian Satan cannot get into your soul it's sealed your seal day and he's sealed out it doesn't matter if he gets in this body what good is the body you'll find out the older you get they don't remember you don't have to worry about memory because you can't remember what she did do you try might try to say it well the best part of memory be the future maybe I can remember something one night away you understand it just comes out to the point listen Eve was anointed with Satan's of 19 and you tell me the difference in Satan's anointing and God's anointing come on we can call the prophets messy dry did the Prophet say Satan can pass out supernatural gifts do you want that one what that brothers got gifts he's done this idea he can he can pass out Satan can pass out supernatural gifts you tell me the difference in your anointing oh I know I know the anointing of God and I know that I know the voice of God oh I listen to people talk like that and I think Oh God I wish to use just some reason I knew that you said well what I know the voice of God yeah you ever known the voice of God divorced of the devil comes to so sweet and nice and he's so good and you're so lovely and you're so wonderful and you are the body of Christ and you're getting ready to leave out of here and go into you say that's the devil yeah you know what God says sit down shut up and listen well God looks like he's hateful but tell me if that is that the truth you acting like a baby he said shut up acting like a baby rise up and go quit letting those things get you oh we thank God's voice is real sweet and salt mm-hmm he got Moses out there when Moses come up to the the Red Sea and what did he get him he got him standing out to the place and Moses begin to doubt what'd he say he said Moses shut up I've listened to you all these times you murmured y'all how ten times read your Bible you remember ten times before you come to that place and said every time I went on we said shut up sleep and go forward did not called you for the job oh we think God saw it was so sweet and humble and and everything we think he did showers us with everything the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous oh but the Lord lead us out of them all do you realize now we're not talking about bad colds or sniffles or cause you stomped you toe or don't be silly but do you realize any major thing that comes upon you God has to permit that to take place you wanna stay all day and preach on and talk about that he has to permit that to happen to you what does he do that far to try you to see if you'll stay with him what did he do with Abraham whenever haven't done everything in the book and done all and was promised a son and he finally got her son Isaac and he gets up thirteen fourteen years old or something and what happens God said take him out and kill him read your Bible Abraham gets everything ready and he's leaving out and he goes way out in the wilderness all for Isaac under God Isaac gets inquisitive and he said them go now Abrahamson yours the wood and yours the fire they said we're going out here you've told us you're going out here to make an offering he said yeah you know Isaac he said well worse the offering that what did Abraham say ricci Bible it was him did God will provide but you know what Abraham was planning on doing killing his own son just as he gets ready to cut his throat the angel the Lord stops him and says God says now Abraham I know you love me because you wouldn't hold withhold your only son from me we think of God as being so soft and sweet and dodi like a dirty old granddaddy you know but listen he's trying you and me to see if we'll stay with the word was that the life statements we might what does it say over there Deuteronomy he said if a prophet comes among you and gives a sign and all like that and it comes to pass we said if he leads you to another God don't listen to him now how are you gonna tell which ones which it gives you a sign and it comes to Pius now how are you gonna tell which ones with that's about new to running me 23 somewhere right in there read it but roll out what part I love to read is what he says he says because I have sent this person among you to try you to see if you will love me read it same thing of Abraham to see if you'll stay with my word and see if you love me we'll get to that the morning salvation something through but think about it but God God is not like that God is good we sing the song God is good god is good yeah yes he's also straight he stays with his word do you think you would go out and offer your child up to God now don't worry about it we got the words of the Prophet he done it one time he ain't gonna do it again so you come along tell me that will what God told me to go offer up my sacrifice my son I'm gonna tell you forget it that ain't God oh who are you I've had a lot of people to tell me God told them and I just to do tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu you know what I mean I just kind of get away cuz I don't and say he didn't tell you that well you've told me that will your prize for me to tell you it was most of the time I just want go out and leave it and forget it cuz you're gonna believe what you want to believe like I was trying to explain the other day see people who say we had a prophet I believe what he says but when anybody else tells you what the prophets saying why don't you believe that what winded works change you understand I mean the Bible said in Deuteronomy take you to another God what's taking you to another God taking you to your own ideas your thoughts or anything contrary to God the brother Dale he's just arrogant hateful he just here well good at least I'll quote the Prophet back to you if I'm arrogant hateful to you you'll realize that I'm not trying to pull something over on you that's a quote if you want I'm trying to get you to realize and to believe what the Bible says we'll get to it this evening what is salvation based upon I spoke in tongues I cried I done this edit there's none of that can you put it on that it's put on one time whether you can believe God's Word or not not on any of those basis of what we've all been taught that it was I'm talking my Old Testament salvation surely won't get in the new listen Eve was anointed in her understanding in her spirit realm a reason memory conscious and things she was anointed of Satan to believe God's Word just had one little twist to write everything to be said to Eve was right that's what I've tried to get you to get away from that old the devil he said the devil he talked Eve right down the line and when it come down to the end of the line they wouldn't but one time he said you were made for that reason and she said okay we read it as there's one lie I like where the Bible says you know that did believe a lie be damned you know what the Prophet said that was he said it same lie that Satan told Eve the same lie is still being told today you know what it's being told today you are to be the Bride of Christ that's true he's not telling you you to you're the devil's children he's not telling anybody that I'm kind of weirdos has gone freaks that's not human beings that even wouldn't think that what Satan is Chinese best to tell us who we are by the word like I said ending up what we were talking about he said the bride is to prove to Satan that we won't fall for that lie what lie bring it down to the day what's the light of day now listen we say we're the children of God were the people of God we believe the message we write into everything oh you sound weird when you preach but is it the truth okay if it's the truth what have we got to be any problem you said yeah but you said that the devil is trying he's trying to expand to tell the people this message they're the bride of Jesus Christ and then the brain fourth Christ but that's the same thing Eve was told and the same things happening as it did to Eve back there because I'm still in what the prophets said ain't D Christianizing nobody and saying anybody this out of the others lost that's between you and God the Paul was telling the Church of born-again believers be careful you can be deceived Oh see we've got that we know the quote oh we can't be deceived we're pointing in Christians we can't be deceived tell me what happened to the church down through the dark ages did your prophet spoken words original seed set like this he said Adams Bryan failed before bringing forth he said jehovah's bride of the Old Testament failed before producing correctly he said the bride of Jesus Christ fell before if you don't believe in it being the father what are you dealing with restoration I will restore the years of the can corn problem bruh if you didn't follow what do you need to restore see the deception that's what I've tried to get you to see where you can see it correctly the deception is in the spirit of mankind through the memory reason conscious affections and things that's the way he took the church off and had juice the other : you were run around City even under the baptism of the holy ghost they twisted it not the baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't do it they twisted it they wasn't supposed to go to Nasia they went and they come out of there without it little back of one egg just one mean one of the word and when they did the first thing you know they brought a trinity and to be who brought that old him false vine see that's the way people when it when they get put against the wall you want to come out with a concept it was the false vine that failed well what do you tell about restoration you're trying to restore the false fine oh I didn't think of it like a you see church that's what some could us here 50 years after the prophets gone the people's not believing the word not accepting the word and staying right with that word and said forget it right in the devil's trap of anointing and if you know what it is the genuine anointing come on get the message anointed ones and read it genuine anointing and see if you don't understand the message correctly how you going to understand a19 how are you gonna understand Matthew 24:24 they said in the last days they would be false Christ how are you going to understand even the simple plan of salvation of the new birth where is it at does it take place in your body does it take place in your spirit or take place in your soul where does it take place well I just accept the Jesus Christ the male quote the Prophet as Jesus Christ accepted you well yeah well what happened I shouted a crowd of religion the quickest way the best way for you to understand the new birth to see whether you got it or not is to remember the 1:9 it's whether the Spirit of the Guardian you agrees with the word right is that the evidence of the Holy Ghost whether the Spirit of God in you agrees with the word now listen agrees means continual he didn't say the Prophet didn't say whether or not the Holy Spirit agreed with the word it's whether he agrees with the word if it ever stops it's not the new birth if it leads into a two so seven Thunder parousia doctrines of the message it's not the new birth it's the devil coming among you to try you and God permitting it to take place yes but you sound like that my god my god I know my God my God is love you just ain't been around long enough yet yes but it would but my god love and sweet and humble yeah and would stand back in the Old Testament and order the destruction of an entire nation and emphasize the killing them of the men women and the children ever amirite ever more by the river one yes but but we're the New Testament I bet you them first so you didn't think too much of Jesus when they thought you saying your God he turned around and looked at him he said you are of your father the devil and his works you will do they didn't like the head I'll bet you they didn't think he's too sweet on that okay listen so we know for a certainty then what happened in the garden was beginning to reason upon God's Word and if she did it prover lead the way that it would come so all it takes is one word now we're going to rehash a little Sunday's message which I've been doing this for 40 years so it ain't no problem you talk to the ministers of this message and they just use brother branham's message anywhere they want to use it anyway they hunt a quote off the computer and it's the most damaging thing that has ever been I'll say that I got one to two and a half on the study and they will tell him anymore I got three or four of them but it's the most damaging thing they could ever be to a new born-again a but again Christian that doesn't have training to listen to the word because you can make bread around say anything you want to right what's the thank God for it you know why I used to make a statement and people say where did brother on say that I spent three months three months trying to find that statement and sometimes six months I remember one one brother said something one time and I said that ain't true well you shorted I said okay I'll find it it took me almost six months but one day I walked up and laid it in front anything you see we had a lot of concordances and here's mine I wrote down a lot of things in my Bible as I come along to her that I could pull it up in a hurry and follow that and I reference from this scripture here back over to this scripture here were that I can have it in my memories and times yeah why because we're supposed to believe what the Prophet says yeah but I got a quote well what does it say you know the quote the Prophet said write what you going down go to hell and he said you do likewise you want to read it any creature you want to write any quotes you want to read in this message I've put the challenge out 40 years ago on that is anything if you want to say I'll give you within this the memory a quote that seems totally contrary I had one message you give me a quote from the scriptures I can give you scriptures that seem contrary I have one Bible like a sinner talking to man on the phone he called me and said something I said we'll give me a minute let me look it up I don't matter code I don't know whether you looked upright or not in other words didn't matter he didn't make no difference because he wouldn't gonna listen to what was said okay I tried to explain in how for like 40 years because I asked you a simple question how can you understand the new birth in work takes place and what it is how can you understand it is it in your bodies and your spirit is in yourself but I can read you a quote in the early part of brother runs ministry that the new birth is in the spirit then I can read you in the lighter ministry where it's in their soul would see them that's what gives me you explain Mathew 24:24 I got brother Brian laying right here where he said explain Matthew 24:24 without understanding or no one he'd once were that it would be false Christ anointed ones anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit and still be loved but if I have the Holy Spirit I'll say I'm going to heaven I got to quote lay in here where the Prophet said don't you say those times Wow because if that anointing is on your spirit you're not born again draw out three little rims you go home and you write body spirit and soul outside is see taste feel smell in here you just contact the world with that inside of that is memory reason concert etc in the second room because the center only has one sense and I see the faith or doubt you're either born again or you're lost right okay now you're either born again are you lost all right so how are you going to understand when the Prophet would say you can have the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit on your spirit and still be lost and die and go to hell and for 40 years I've tried to explain it to prophet in his early ministry he would interchange the word soul and spirit because the Bible interchanges the soul and spirit read your Bible it'll-it'll change the word and give you one basic meaning for it and it'll interchange it you've got to find out what it's talking about to put it in the right order you remember Caiaphas the high priests prophesy that it was necessary that one die for the sins of the people then for all of them are the problems of the people cause to see they were trying to get rid of him because he don't call it an insurrection and he said it and he quoted the scripture why because it was the anointing on Caiaphas cause he was the high priest under you way of saying things I don't I don't even see how anybody can be saved I don't either I was honest and truthful as I can be I don't need it it isn't it has that has got to be a very act of Almighty God I've never tried to prove whether I saved or lost ain't got him to do it it's whether the word is true or not seeing brother Browns early ministry he would freak and he would bring and he would rat the three realms he would draw him out I'll pick him up this evening because we don't have time now and he would draw out and he put body then he'd put soul and he put spirit and he give the outside man five senses sea-chest feel familiar he give the second rim memory reason conscious affection here the center rim faith or doubt after the opening of the seals the word Hebrews for let a 4-12 become sharper to divide between soul and spirit joints and marrow he taught body spirit and soul you say well how do we need to know that tell me where you're born again Anna tell me where you're born again out are you born again in your body are you born again your spirit are you born again in your soul which one we can take the early part of the ministry to prove that you're born again in your spirit and it's your soul has memory reason conscious affections take the later part of the Ministry of the Prophet and prove under the anointing of the anointed ones remember he never preached the anointed ones until after it was revealed to him that it was body spirit and soul to be correct studies the message and see in his later ministry how would you understand Matthew 24:24 that they be false Christ a genuine Holy Spirit to anoint the people the Holy Spirit being on your spirit explain how to say this part and we explained the new birth according to Ezekiel 36 right in there he said I'll give you a new heart a new spirit but then he says and I'll put my spirit in you now where's that out do you know you're saved I sounded that crowd at spoke and telling us all these thing I pray I fast I do everything in the Bible but Ron says you say you pray he said the outshine us you know what you don't dare go up to the White House that's a bunch of Christians and get down and pray but let the Muhammadans and then I'm not against anybody whatsoever they're human beings a right to live and right to the Tree of Life would you let them go to the White House and get down and pray and nobody ain't gonna stop them they are more sincere than we are right Islamic teachings and the fasting one month out of the year that run every year you got to do this you got to do that and you're supposed to make at least one trip to Mecca in your life to ensure you a better world and they do everything they can to get to higher you want to go with sincerity sincerity you wanna go into sincerity woman take a baby throw it to an alligator to preach to try to appease a God you want try that you want to get into some things that are in the Bible what about the man that needed help from these 12 parts of the tribes you remember your Bible what did he do he took his wife and cut her in 12 pieces and sent one piece to each tribe you want sincerity you better have something besides your sincerity you better have something besides just your reasoning factors to be able to comprehend the brother they'll have always believed our sage until he heard you preach okay praise God I've done my job now you do something about it right now you do something about it get something that you can anchor we'll get something you know it's you're satisfied with you know your prophet said you came how the Holy Ghost not having an experience we got one here you want to read it where he said don't you say that you've got an experience means you're saved he's writing both places right well because experience is just something you live through or not II of thought or idea concept of mankind but their true born-again Christian an experience is a change of the nature what about it I know I'm saved brother though you can't tell me I ain't say that's where the trouble is can God tell you what if he's him speaking through a dumb beast again like me I don't mind talking hard what if he's using me to try to deceive you you know what I'm gonna do the best job I can do that's that's why I want to go somewheres else they shout emotions and they don't never talk about bad things they're always up and I always glory hallelujah don't let the door hit you usually go out help yourself all I ask you is one thing what does the word say that's all I ask is what is the word you know what the word says word says they'll be false and they'll be anointed ones in the end time that would deceive the very elect if it was possible on as I said want to go we say I can't be deceived I'm he left okay will agree we forgot about this statement the Prophet said frankly it would get the elect messed up delete have to cut the work short go ahead you quote unquote with you does that mean we're saved or lost could mean all of us is lost if it is I'm doing my best to get us to the place to find out if we're lost yeah but my salvation is always being as I spoke in tongues I shouted I cried I don't praise God that's a working to the Holy Spirit but you do every bit of that and be lost what are you gonna put it on come on these issues what are you gonna put it on well I'm barely getting to the place brother day on it well you preach this I mean I really don't know what to put it on well praise God I've done my job I've confused you enough until now you can do something about it you mean I'm supposed to let you go ahead and die and go to hell and stand at you looking in hell and say well I could have helped you but I didn't remember anointed ones are anointed on their spirit with the genuine Holy Spirit but they are not anointed in their soul the soul is either lost or saved faith or doubt but we live in an anointing world esteem we live in a world of anointing this was trying to get the point we are anointed to believe this and believe that he was anointed to believe that she was to produce as he produced it what about your anointing what is it they made anything hard for to understand oh it's just a fact of one thing what are we put in our salvation what is it based on now quote if we get a little up this afternoon the Prophet said salvation is based on one time the Word of God no matter if it's Old Testament or neither you realize under the Old Testament if you kept the law to the letter you was not guilty but you realize the law was added because of transgressions you know what the law became a record keeper of your sin that's why you will read one of these days and the Prophet it'll don't only where he said the biggest mistake Israel ever made was asking for the law in Exodus 19 what did they need the law for they had to Pillar a fire they had the grace of God they had a prophet that could solve all of their problems yet they wanted to law read you Bible but - but but but the laws were to God yeah Paul said the letter killeth there was no mercy written in the law say mister some cuz you won't be back but there was no mercy written in the law but while the law was in existence there was salvation in a place for them to go to when they died no salvation go ahead brother what we got you might have a need the altars open I hope you follow and listen yes Nina Oh Janice d'Orsay No and here my [Music] and Wow there's no more coal do
