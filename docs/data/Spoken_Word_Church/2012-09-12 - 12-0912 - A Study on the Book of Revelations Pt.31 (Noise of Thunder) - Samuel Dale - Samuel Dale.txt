when i do these things i talk about the lord and it's accepted and i just pray that i have opportunities to share that and it's just an opportunity to express him not me amen and just pray for me because you never stand up here you never stand up here let's change my oh pour out your power in love oh pour out your power in lovely home good to see everybody in the house of the lord you like turning your scriptures during we've been reading in revelations 1. one through three and then we'll read revelation six verse one and two it's good to be in the house of the lord really had a good time this last weekend with brother samuel speaking to mars a little time to fellowship with him and everything and went over this morning and ate breakfast with him and the brother was taking him up to brother uh tim hymns for the night for the service so distract the lord would bless him and take care of him as he travels all right remember the fellowship meeting this coming saturday so we will be leaving here for my house at 10 30 not 10 35 10 30. you're late you'll call us up and tell you how to get there because we've got a large group going there's a good many of us we're gonna have to even take an extra vehicle and different things to to make everything work out but we'll be glad to do that now so remember that this coming uh saturday also now i will announce this where we can kind of get it in order but it's been requested from some that we uh take and go back over to daniel seven weeks kind of like we did it at the minister's meeting and uh so we'll the lord willing not this coming weekend now but next weekend on the 23rd we would be trying to cover that tour that we can like i'll take one service away take one and try to uh speak on those things maybe getting uh an hour and a half instead of you know an hour we can do a little bit better and slow down some but we'll try to do that and you just pray the lord would bless no sinus is aggravating dragging down you know running down but the lord take care of it revelations 1 and revelation 6. heavenly father we thank you lord for your loving your grace unto us thank you for the day and the hour that we're living thank you for salvation thank you for peace thank you for joy in our hearts thank you for you lord and just come down tonight now and reveal yourself because there's an order to all things and it all has to be in a direct order and a direct line up for us to be able to receive we must be in the right order ourselves in yielding ourselves to you to try to understand so just come and help us lord and direct us in your grace and love we committed to you now in jesus name amen all right revelation 1 we've been on that because we've been on the study of the book of revelations this is the 30 31 messages you don't know how long we'll be on it maybe until the millennium and then we can understand it says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what the time to understand is at hand all right revelation six one through two one and two and i saw on the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts say come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i want us to just leave that up brother joe on revelation 6 because i want us to emphasize a little bit on that you know and i guess brother anderson stood brother joe and we were running one ago and we didn't have anybody on the camera and sitting in the office wondering whether joe was too old we're missing somebody so we had to jump up and grab one and get everything to go with you know we certainly appreciate those brothers for doing all that they do appreciate god putting them in a position to work that they would would be able to uh do these things when it would come up needful amen we appreciate it but they have everybody with us their sister is not a visitor she's been here one time so she's part of us so just make yourself at home now we've been trying to talk a little bit about the um opening of the seals and the different things there in the book of revelations and we were speaking a good bit about the antichrist want to just kind of slide this message in tonight on the scriptural lineup and and then we'll drop back to the uh you know the antichrist and the systems and and the things but i want us to just look at a few things that will maybe be helpful unto us and then father in the line up of it to be able to uh see we've studied revelations one two three four and in revelation four we found that there was a uh four beast and like a lion one like an ox one like a man one like an eagle was in the fourth chapter all right now when we come to the sixth chapter of the uh you know opening of the seals and said when the lamb would open one you know open one of the seals look what he said and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see right now that's what we'll be dealing with tonight in that part and looking into it see if you read that the way it's written out there it says simply what and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts didn't come and see that what he heard was like a thunder right but he knew it was the voice of the beast they were saying come and see all right now then it says and i saw and behold a white horse all right see then it opens up into a symbol but now remember and you'll get the point of what i'm driving at for the night that those combat beasts as we'll read in a minute they are the spirit of god that is manifest you know and going forward and then you you'll pick up a few things as we go along and you'll see that it was actually the the combat beast right now father what i'm saying now the combat beast it says come and see so what john saw was shown to him by the combat beast all right now it would be very easy in this day to talk about the combat beast it is for a lot of people in this way and they'll say well now that was brother branham right there you know that you know that first seal i said come and see the beast said come and see but if you'll notice it goes on down to the next seal and it says that there was another combat list right right you'll go on down to the next one and it says the third beast right then you get down to the fourth one which is chapter six and verse seven nine and you'll see that it's talking about then the eagle or the end time amen all right now most of you know for all of the years what i preached about these combat beasts that i believe it's the spirit of god and we've read it and proved it that is revealing or making known the combat beasts have the ability to make things known right right man i mean that's what i want us to consider and then we'll get to the point of seeing really about our age and the eagle you know the anointing but don't just jump over there and try to say well that one that spoke to john must have been brother brown no it wouldn't brother branham it was it was the spirit of god amen right all right and being the spirit of god it was god using someone to speak right he says and i heard i heard as it were the noise of thunder and see that's god speaking amen right right forgive me if i can walk this thing around and hurt it it's funny that i can talk all week long and not run out of voice but then i come up to breach and it starts messing up right but now listen with me see the combat beast is the one that says come and see that's right amen now and he also shows john the white horse rider you know in other words he points him out right shows it right so now it would not it could not be mankind it would have to be something closer to that form than it would to be to just a man right because a man can thunder all he wants to you know run his mouth but that's no good unless god is speaking through it all right you need to point out a lot of things right but he can't reveal nothing right now when i get over the message a minute i want you to think on this very seriously the words of a man goes through your brain when we here goes to our brain our head down into the heart right now if it doesn't go from the head to the heart and we're only dealing with the words of a man right amen and that's what people do i've got scripture i've got quotes i can tell you what i'm saying well and good but is it a revelation that's right amen or is it a head knowledge right that's true that's why it's so hard to follow people you know that really try to preach by revelation right it's easy to follow people that preach about and listen i believe in living right and doing right right i believe what the prophet said the bible says but now if all you're going to preach on is dress and iron clothes and things like that you're only talking to the head and you may change the people because alcoholics anonymous does a great work right right but they don't touch the heart right they touch touching the head all right then getting you to make a decision etc we see a revelation deals in the heart of mankind amen and if no matter what we can say that we can know everything that brother around says that's no good unless it's revealed now there are a lot of the people in the message that believe that you know that is a revelation the quotes i've got written here they say that's the revelation right around that revelation i don't have to have it well the only best way to tell you're lost right right because you can't be saved except to be revealed to you right now that's what that's what demanded i'm holding up the papers i'm saying right he said you can't be saved without faith without a revelation amen the scripture says that no man can call jesus to christ unless it be what from the inside out not from the head but from the heart he speaks out and then he can call jesus to christ all right see then my point of what i want us to look at is just put a title there a noise of a thunder right i'm not going into the seventh thunder or since it don't so don't get excited you're on the internet don't just stay with me where i'm at we'll get time to get there but this is a foundation for that and that's why i read you the other week the prophet said if we don't get the foundation right yeah then nothing else is not gonna fit you know right so we need the foundation we need the truth and follow it but see notice what it says as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now we know what he's saying right he said come and see is that simple right we don't have to wonder what he said now the next part of it is when and then when that it says and i saw and behold a white horse now you're going into a symbolic form that even though you can read the words you don't know what it's saying right are you listening i'm just trying to make it as simple as possible when the combat beast says come and see that's no problem you just come and see right amen that's like telling you nothing come to see me well there's no problem with that isn't it all right i mean that's simply me come see me see that combat beast is saying come and sing all right now the world can't even hear that part they can hear letters off of a page but when you start dealing with that thunders we will admit it being the voice of god many people have heard the voice of god right he had spoken unto him but did he do him any good right jesus preached around all over the country right now but did he do any good right why because they couldn't even follow it like in john there when when jesus was talking about you know i'm glorifying me and me with the glory of having people he said i'm glorified in your name and glorified again and those that stood by heard it thunder never heard a word that would say it right no sir right man the bible tells you what was said right right but they heard it thunder man that's why it's got to be the holy spirit to reveal it right right right no man can reveal anything to you amen according brother around jesus said my own life didn't reveal that unto thee he said it was my father which is in heaven the only remember the word is the baptism of the holy ghost so if we don't have the baptism in the holy ghost whatever is said by the prophet the bible or anyone is just a noisy thunder now think about that there's still jesus in a voice boat and he heard what was said right but everybody else heard it go a blue would it be possible that we could actually sit right here and hear the very words of god that would be able to deliver us and yet it would wind up to be only just words that are touching the head right and not the heart right would make us good people we would go to church rejoice there anything wrong with the pharisees life you know in the time of jesus right oh no right amen was there anything wrong in their worship in their right no they live the word to the letter amen right but yet when the god of the letter stood before him they couldn't hear his voice right now they heard words in their ears their brain could translate that and if they were were greek but was capable of understanding will you know i know jesus spoke uh the former what is it aramaic which was a common language but that greek he had been trained he could understand right his mind could translate what jesus was saying from the paramedic or whatever back into to the greek didn't have any problems with that that's right well i was talking about the other day about it the bible says it that jesus spoke in parables right and he didn't speak to the people without a parable the disciples would ask him later and he would describe or explain the parables that's right all right finally the pharisees began to realize hey he's talking about us they caught on you know all right but it was done too late to see the god right they were standing there all right now see then the combat beast told john said come and see but it was like a noise of thunder because that was the voice of god amen see those combat beasts they have no voice of their own and we're talking about the heavenly the doings now when they drop the earth we're not dealing with that we're up in heaven okay those combat beasts have no voice of their own nobody understand what i'm trying to get across they have no voice of their own that's right when they come to earth and become the lion the oxen and the eagles now you've got voices right right you see they have no voice of their own because they are the spirit of god right that's right that's why it says annoys like a thunder the thunder of god is a is the voice of god it thundered at mount sinai amen but the people what did they do right now he spoke from mount sinai not just that there was a thunder going on right he was speaking but when it came down to the earthly form of mankind all i could hear was and they got scared i've got in here a couple of questions one of them is have we heard the voice of god or has it been the voice of a man amen i'll repeat this about a dozen times okay the voice of man will touch you in your head right amen the reasoning factors of mankind god speaks not to your brain he speaks to your heart you may have to use your brain sure to go through that's right well that's the human element that's why when a man really when god speaks to him in his heart there ain't nothing to do with it he might we'll leave him if god spoke right now if it's only what man spoke another man with eloquent words can convert that person over to believing like what they're saying that's right right if god ever speaks to you it don't matter tomorrow you might not just forget it because he's speaking to the heart right right all right then if he's speaking here and this combat beast he's speaking to john see then we can call it a line we can call it an ox we can call it a man we can call it an eagle right right but what is it it's the voice of god right speaking through someone then being the voice of god then we don't have to worry about it all we got to do is believe it but i remember my point and listen see then when we read the first one it says you know the first combat beast well if i want to run that over and i said to brother brown and put it all over there that's what i want you to see that first combat beast on earthly terms was the line of the tribe of judah the word of god going out in the early ages the voice of god right sure that's why paul and them could be so stern and straight about what they would say that's right they didn't compromise they said what god said amen to the world their voice was a thunder and if we're not born again tonight we can read the same words that he said back there and it's still just a noise right it's just the noise of the thunder but that thunder through that combat beast is the voice of almighty god delivering the message to john right on patents which is come and see see then he saw why i was writer you don't know and he had a bow with no arrows and the things but my point is is god spoke to you right that's right amen thinking what mama said it's real good you know what daddy said that's real good taking what brother brown said is real good but as god spoke to you and i that's right into our heart not in her head gotta come through there we'll cover if we have time tonight but not we'll get it later but sure this comes down to where the eagle comes right in the end time to bring the message but remember all of those combat beasts have to be the spirit of god that's the only way they can have the voice of god amen is because that combat beast is a manifestation of the holy spirit and when you bring it to earth then you can see that it is the line the word that went out in the early times of the writing of the book of acts and the things the bible says hear his voice now a lot of people have heard the words of god but have you heard the voice of god that's right well what do you mean i don't understand you you talk so much riddles riddles of what how much more simple can that be brought right this bible we hold up we say is the word of god but this bible that we hold up and read from says the letter killeth but the spirit gives life what was wrong with the pharisees and sadducees they had it to the letter amen that was what was killing them right because the letter spoke of a coming messiah but they had it figured out their way and then there was no persuasion to try to change their mind jesus never tried to argue with him about the word matter of fact he used it right against him so did paul right he said the word says well they couldn't argue with it because he was speaking to him about what they claim to be true now what about you and i we claim to follow a message we claim to believe that god spoke to us through a man right amen and that's well and good because we believe that but i believe he spoke to us to us or speaks to us through peter paul james john those that are in the bible don't you right man the only difference is we're in the end time right if we were back there we would be listening to them speak and say that is the voice of god right see then that way we're not putting the emphasis upon the man we're putting the emphasis upon the god that's speaking to us right amen you know the dumb donkey told the prophet one time in the bible spoke to him told him the word of god right saved him from being killed well rooster crew corrected peter why can't we believe that god can speak to us but see the point i want you to look at is is that not we're not trying to get in i preached to you for 40 years about the the combat beasts and how it's the spirit of god down to the ages amen i think it's time to begin to realize that we must hear the voice of god amen by way of the prophet messenger amen right right that's right now we got the part of it right we got the part that we believe the message of course a lot of people don't believe it because they're always trying to change what he said or correct him or something you know right that's their business that's not mine yours which either thunder is the voice of god so now if it's the voice of god then that combat beast must have been god all right that's right right in another form amen right right see then when it came to earth to dwell on the earth then we would start out with the first combat beast being you know the word the line the next one is the ox that goes on down into the chest ages you know when they begin to kill them and and all of the things then it comes out under the minds it's the lime yachts man comes out under man under luther wesley ziegly and knotts and calvin and all of those smart people that begin to bring us the word of god all right you see then in doing that you always say it's easy to follow the first three combat beasts and it'll be it'll be a spirit among the people brother brandon there on the first seal i think it is i've got it in the notes said i want to put this box up here said to represent he said the spirit of god that was being used you know doing but that's what i want you to see if it's a noise if it it you know if it's a noise of thunder it's the voice of god right yes see then when you come down to the age it's the line the ox to man that's fine you can follow those but then the end time people will deal only with brother brown as equal they won't listen to where he says when the eagles come and then they'll halfway listen to where that we're little eaglets you know but you realize if somebody tells you the truth and they have the holy spirit and they're speaking to you what is the difference in that voice and the voice of almighty god that's right that's right now i made it out to where i said it right if they tell you the truth now all this blame you know babbling and all this other stuff they don't amount to nothing but but if a true person with a genuine baptism of the holy ghost whether it be man woman child or white that's right and they're telling you the truth then what's the difference in that voice and the voice of god that thundered at mount sinai or the one that spoke in john there when the jesus was standing there see that thunder is the voice of god amen that's why when you do get down to the seven thunders it's simple to see right you hold your channel correctly that the thunder's the voice of god and you'll see that god thundered as the seals were being broken right because when you read your seals if you'll notice there was only one thunder right there on the first seal you didn't put a thunder on the second one right third fourth and then when you get to the fifth seal you don't even have a combat beast you only have four combat beasts right right right you get to the fifth six and seven seal you don't even have a combat beast now i wrote myself a note i ain't even found it yet cut off the nose but how many voices does god have all right now i'm not talking about how he sounds and what he does and through people and you know do it i'm talking about how many voices does he have he has only one voice that's why when the seals broke it thundered amen that's the voice of god amen and only god can tell us what under those what's under those seals so then have we heard the voice of god yeah or have we heard just the voice of a man that's right when we read the bible when we get over to the red letter edition you know it means jesus is speaking do we really hear that is god speaking to us are we still thinking about well that's what luke wrote you understand what people say well that's what matthew said matthew says go out and baptize what name of the father not of the son and of the holy ghost matthew 28 19. that's what he said but over the book of acts they baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ somebody messed up on the voice didn't it they heard the words all right they didn't understand the voice because that voice speaking over there when jesus said it it's in red letter now how come peter and him didn't follow what he said yeah right they bounced out of the name of the lord jesus christ lord jesus christ but he told them it looked like the baptized father son holy ghost because peter by the time that he said what he said he had the inward experience of the baptism of the holy ghost amen in other words he had the spirit of god within him right all right amen those disciples had the spirit of god within them didn't it then they could understand that jesus wasn't saying father son holy ghost because he said it correctly said in the name right singular of the father another son of the holy ghost not three names all right there's only one name right amen just illustrating the words of a man can convert you and put you in the water and you'll go follow it because you say well i've been out arguing put a revelation in your heart of who that is speaking to you and what really happened to her right it won't only just put you in the water it'll put you in the body right you know you just keep right on going until you come into the body of christ because it will come for not dealing with the head it will start coming into the heart and in doing that then we can say that we've heard the voice of god well brother brother daley god never spoke to me who is it speaking to you when you read the bible are you still hooked up what i'm saying luke said that when you're reading your bible who's talking to you i believe in order i'll be red letter myself no not just because of what jesus said right but all of it is what god said right then if i follow it that away see that i can realize what the voice of god is it's a thunder to those who can't understand but to those who can receive it is god speaking amen whether it be the rooster crowd or the donkey brain right it was still the voice of god amen you corrected the prophet but follow my point see look at that combat beast as being the spirit of almighty god and then when it comes to earth it will be made manifest in many people it won't be just one person see no that's right it'll be manifested in many people because it's the voice of god see it was what was combating the antichrist right as it goes forward because it was god speaking through man to man that's right he uses man to speak amen thank god for that like that yeah amen but you remember as i was quoting there a moment ago that mount sinai thundered and they said don't let god speak no more to us now folks whether you like it or not we chose that oh i didn't i wouldn't back there no but if you'd have been back there you would have chose that okay all right not enough you can make all you want to and twist it but it won't work right see they said don't let god speak unless we die said moses you go up find out what god wants us to know bring it back and we'll do it they lied like crazy but when moses went up and got it and brought it back oh you're a man yep is that what you were doing you some kind of a god were you a man just like we are wasn't that their argument with moses moses said everyone's on god's side come over here and you know there was 250 priests there was preachers okay 250 priests carrying cold off the fire in the sensors exactly the way you know the cuts and the things the way they were supposed to do the earth swallowed them up right they took those golden things and beat them up and reused them because it was okay but the people died right in the front of god standing there in a man called moses right he said no he was god no i didn't say that i said god's standing there and a man called moses you didn't listen to what i said brother around him wasn't god right but god used the man to speak to us that's right even one of the texts he said i'm using his voice this is not william bradley i'm using his voice you say a lot of times i don't know what i say i'll have to go back and let play the tape see what i'm saying but you see we we look at that and that voice of god can speak to a child right and tell you the truth that's right no no no brother dale if you don't make anything gotta make it to preachers why because you won is that the reason you want it that way why can't you see the spirit of god is in the bride of jesus christ amen they ask the prophet will the will the bride have a ministry he said she consists of apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers she consists of that's puts it all together five four minutes right worth nothing without a bribe i try to direct but you see church that's why i don't speak i know i'm human sometimes i do i blabber a lot and i speak from the head and that's what you see preachers do they they beat you over the head because they're speaking from the head but you see a man that's truly a servant of god he'll speak from the heart he's hard to be understood then that's right because sometimes he'll speak in riddles sometimes right because it's the spirit of god directing him in that path amen but if you've got the spirit of god why are you worried about it right see the thunder's the voice of god now being the voice of god who's it come true that's right man you're going to talk to some of these little kids and ask them some questions you might be surprising how great an understanding they have because they're sitting listening i have more understanding than some of us adults and guys because they're more subject to god right sweeter nicer right but noise of a thunder the noise of the thunder was when the combat beast said come and see right anybody can read that can they but they can they understand that god is speaking to that person or those people you know because that's what the combat beats are right it's god among the people for the age that you're living in time and it comes down to the ego being the lies to sum up all things and see being that eagle then god can speak to him things that even some of the others couldn't comprehend i don't think god's upset because i said it that way you like that see that early age went out under the word the word was pure and unadulterated but that line of that bar was calling it they didn't know what the seals and things were right because it was not time for it to open amen but it was still the spirit of god right amen right all right when the when the ox came out you know the the sacrificial animals the ops and the things and then through the dark ages they gave their lives freely for the gospel uh you know rick fox's book of martyrs and see how many of them was killed what 68 million amen they've slaughtered but that was that spirit of god in them that made them go give their lives freely like it was said a polycarp that he was too old to run i said why don't you deny him he said he can't deny it all right why because he had something in his heart amen right that's right damn it wasn't that polycarp that requested the ones who come to arrest him i believe one would he requested one man did to pray for his enemies that they come to capture him he prayed for me fed him a meal and prayed for him two hours before leaving with him to go be killed spirit was seen as a dove leaving out of him you know fire wouldn't which one was it him that the fire wouldn't even burn he just turned away from him god was honoring that spirit that was within him that's right but you know he couldn't have done that if it hadn't been the word and it began if he didn't have his foundation based upon based upon the fact that the line of the tribe of judah had wrote out the line ministry see neither could lutheran them have come out and been worth anything of their intellectuals points of brains because that's what they were but it was the man brother brown says in the seal book he said god used their intellect to speak out against that bread and wine and things you know i'm telling them that it couldn't that couldn't be right but you know all that was based upon those that had been before them all you and i have is based upon what we have behind us that's right but have you heard the voice of god are you still wondering well brother dale you sound like you're saying that you're god you know the reason you're thinking that is because that spirit on you is trying to make you god in the wrong way i don't mind talking plain because if you've been around here long enough to realize what we're doing and think that i'm trying to make something right you're in bad shape see i'm trying to get you to see within your heart within your heart by the new birth is the only way you can hear the voice of god amen if you don't have the new birth you can't hear it although you hear the words see that's in the head it doesn't drop down into the heart once it drops into the heart of mankind you you can't do anything with that person like those that were back there during the times of the of the killings i mean they were offered to go free if they just recant upon what they believe right exactly amen wasn't it martin luther that they offered him an opportunity to recount on all of his books that he'd read he finally made the statement of what i've written i've written i can't take that back he said because it's a part of me i'm just paraphrasing his words see it wasn't just words on a page to him amen that's right he was trying to describe the god that he was believing was in his heart and getting that to mankind that's all brother branham doing amen he was just describing what god had made known to him into his heart the thunder being the voice of god saying come and see so i can talk all day long about the seals but when something happens to you then you can't change it right once you hear it then you get away from seeing who's who you know you know what i mean in the school they had to who's who well i never could figure out what was what let alone who it didn't matter i didn't get to go to school that much but listen church that voice that speaks to you and i is there one voice that spoke to a prophet and another voice that speaks to you and i yeah where's his son god amen so that's the only way i can know the prophet's right you know how i know the prophet's right you know what i'm fixing to say right you know how i checked the doctrine by my new birth all these doctrines around the message that's right see i checked it by my new birth oh but i i tell you what i i just checked it by the spirit of god that's within me why are you so confused and one of you get caught in all of them you know well i was just wanting to try to help the people you ever heard that over and over i stayed there because i wanted to help the people help them do what not go to hell come on when that prophet began to speak i begin to hear words of the form that i've never heard before man right in his simple old kentucky language he began to talk about god that's right like my wife said even though before we ever even left the baptist remaining she said that he'd done all the things he said he's done said he's got to be a prophet but you see that's what i tried to tell the ministers the other day about it i said if we're going to believe the prophet is being the mouthpiece of god if he says it's 483 and you figure it out to be 481.99 people point one point well brother reynolds no you missed it right that's right because you don't believe what he said he said 483 right well i'm stupid to believe it that way well i'm just stupid enough to believe amen all right let's see what you're doing with it amen i'm just stupid enough to believe what he's saying right right now because i couldn't figure out the 483 i didn't know where to start to find where to start at did you so when he said it's 483 you can take 475 multiplied you come out where you get 491 now 481 point something very close to what he's saying right then you just checking around to find out the calendars have been changed three times right you know what was surprising the other day a lot of people at that ministry meeting didn't know that the calendar had been changed three times he's the one who told us about the gregorian julia and what else alexander is he's the one who told us about that's where i learned that they've been changed three times by him telling you see how we heard it in the head or how we heard it in the heart because god spoke to you in your head or your heart he spoke to you in your head like i said a while ago somebody else could speak to you and convert you to their thinking right yeah right but if he spoke in your heart right there's nothing nobody can do might leave you alone but think about it the voice is a thunder but even after all who say it we could talk about the combat beast and the thunder and the voice of god i want to make one life simple illustration even though it was the voice of god through the combat beast it said come and see when john saw what the combat beast was showing him and he was a prophet he saw a symbol of a white horse right john knew he didn't understand but he was told to write it right that symbol would last 2 000 years of mankind and her smartness and the best they could do but in the end time god would send us a prophet amen that he could speak to him in his heart and he could tell us what those symbols were before i heard of this message i heard the seven church ages talk they taught it there at doraville general motors there was a man in there that was teaching the seven church ages and lined up fairly decent i said fairly decent but you see he couldn't hold it together and right around them again to talk about those church ages i began to see a pattern unfold you just keep unfolding you would walk right down through time and come out at the end to be god speaking to mankind through the voice of a man to tell us the symbols tell us what was said there where did that combat beast while he was there in heaven are you listening i was in heaven couldn't tell you no that combat beast couldn't tell you what that was right or what but he was in heaven and it was sealed to him and all he saw was a white horse he knew it was a church symbol am i quoting the prophet yeah but even john admired that church it's so beautiful right it covered him to a point of admiring it looking at it it's so beautiful but you see in the end time it was to come back to work a profit was to come god could tell us what those symbols were you know he tried to explain those symbols of the seals he preached to seal their one in his early ministry that's right he tried to explain those symbols now your profit because the seals wasn't broke see so it was not he wasn't responsible and he preached and it was like prompted what the people have said that it was cupid with his little bow and arrow shooting arrows of love into the hearts of the saints right your prophet was confused on that even though he was a prophet born to prophet he said i made a horrible mistake that's right he was fixing to preach it wrong you know what happened that combat beast from heaven got connected with that prophet on earth and you begin to realize there's something wrong he said the holy spirit come in the room and corrected me on what i was fixing to say right who is the combat beast the holy spirit there's only one holy spirit that's not why there's only one voice of god sure you've got thousands of little voices yes but every one of them better be the voice of god there's no good right amen what about it have we heard his voice has it spoken in our hearts or is it only spoken to our heads then you see people like we've talked about the other day about the man that told a brother about it he was wrong about jesus's crucifixion because he was crucified on wednesday wouldn't crucified on friday said brother brown had a denominational doctrine by believing that no he was right backwards that was a denominational doctrine then he was crucified on wednesday or thursday and hung around raised early saturday afternoon you never heard that i heard them before heard of the prophet he raised on saturday afternoon and appeared on sunday morning early the first midway because he couldn't be in our 72 hour they would have rotten that's right but see that's the argument right would you ask that person i believe everything brother brown says but that one time yeah so we hadn't heard the voice of god that's right that's right he's thunder in his head that's right when he hears the voice of god you realize that a prophet stands before no one that's right yes sir the answer is to no one even when he preached the white horse rider was the holy spirit there was nobody even though clarks locked and i've told you many times way younger maybe almost a hundred years before then he preached the white horse rider was the antichrist but there was no man who could stand up there and correct that prophet because a prophet stands before god alone right now i ain't saying brother brown didn't that you just misunderstanding me go ahead he took correction when he seen it he took correction who could tell him that's right i've heard people even say say bill or the man one time say bill and i was talking about this well his point was that bill was wrong he was right well i'm just as honest as i can say it we may have a lot running around up in our head we have a very shallow mountain in their heart right that's right what we need is a revelation more than anything amen are you praying for a revelation are you praying for god to speak to your heart or your head there are many many voices that speaks to man's head he could change his thoughts but the voice of god will speak to the heart and you never will be changed amen once he speaks and it's nothing else because there's no word of god even the disciples finally done figured out how long about pretty close to the crucifixion they even that's it working we go thou hast the words of eternal life right they all had figured it out the signs and wonders was following him and they began to catch on one time they finally asked their father said do you now believe right but listen church it's just a thought that comes to me what do we hear have we heard the voice of god revealing these things or have we heard the voice of a man if something is not too clear the best thing to do is just leave it alone just leave it alone let god speak to us about it just wait on him any problem i've studied on things 20 years before i'd ever preach 20 years i'm not trying to copy brother brown i'm doing that i'm just telling you i've seen things and wouldn't preach on them at all but then after i've seen it i'm not worried about nobody or what they want to say about it or tell me that i'm wrong all i want you to do is just come show me what you're right but have we heard it that's the main the point you know we can talk about seals we can talk about combat beasts we can talk about all kind of things but that combat beast said come and see john goes into look and he sees a white horse a rider with a bow with no arrows and he can't explain he had heard the voice of god calling him to it but he couldn't explain it i like what brother woodley said to brother dick one time here the dick said i see that he said put it in your own words if you see it put it in your own words can we put this message in our own words right like i told we were talking out there sunday night it was straight i think i might have done a year but we were talking i said you take one man standing here and one man he's standing here the good old baptist and you say to him what do you believe he says one true and living god you look over to the believer in the message what do you believe one true and living god don't know what you're going to do you've got two people saying the same words now go back and ask them what they believe right you ask the baptist said what do you believe he said i believe in one true and living god god in three persons blessed trinity coequal and co-eternal mercy we know that ain't right so you go to the believer you ask him said would you explain what you believe he said let me tell you brother branham said i didn't ask you what brother said right i asked you to explain to me what you're thinking right what you said well brother random said it you can't get them to say nothing on their own right now they said right around said right now what's the difference in the two people right amen see i say neither one of them can speak from their heart right right you take a man speaking from his heart sometimes it's hard to understand sometimes it's easier to understand from the head because it don't require revelation the heart requires that god speaks to you then have we heard god's voice speaking to us in the end or is it just a thunder which one is come on brother which one is it can you explain what you believe that's it most people explain what brother branham believed right i've heard people explain what brother branham believed that i knew brother brown didn't believe that amen and i've heard them explain what he believed i knew he didn't believe i don't want somebody telling you what i believe i want to tell you myself because you might get confused on what i believe i don't like to speak through an interpreter so here it is this will you call it disposal i guess or here it is under his mercy because the details you say i believe you want to live in god and then go explain the trinity and say he said it i told the only one i ever had to deal with i said you will answer to god if you don't say what i say irregardless of whether you believe what i say or not you tell them what i say and then if i'm wrong we can take care of it that's right because it's very easy to do that i told you the point of worthy he was trying to interpret when i told her sister that sister says are they you know i'm glad to be there and glad that the wife is standing behind her husband you know and all and things like that and real good help me everybody in the congregation about 300 and something people were just dying laughing i looked at him i said billy what'd you say he said i said what you saying i said no there's something wrong now why did all these people laugh i said did what did you say from genesis where it said help meat he said that's what i said help me but help me to them meant me met a hamburger that's what it meant it meant meat m-e-a-t i said that ain't what it says you don't say mate it says meat it means uh joined together as one you're the same as we're standing there just talking like crazy thrilling some people just dying laughing because half of them could understand what i was saying you know i said you tell them what i say and i found out later their word meat meant like a companion marriage etc you know bonded i said well you know and don't say help mate and genesis help help me you know that's where we got to keep it right i want i want you to know what i believe right let's stand number two the woman think about what i'm saying have you heard the voice of god have you heard the voice of a man that's right that's right yep which one number two red bull oh i want to sing amen is you are healed oh oh you foreign have you heard forever foreign oh you heard that voice uh oh oh oh oh and he heard his voice one two three foreign hey foreign just and no matter what going on he can't take it back i live here god in your heart oh is just remember now we're going to the fellowship meeting make sure we
