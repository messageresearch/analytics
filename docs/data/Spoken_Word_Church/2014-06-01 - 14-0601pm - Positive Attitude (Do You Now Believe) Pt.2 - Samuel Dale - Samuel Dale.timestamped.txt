[11:24] i want to see you
[11:28] amen amen amen and amen
[11:31] i don't want to see him don't you
[11:33] good to see everybody in the house of
[11:35] the lord if you'd like to
[11:36] turn in your scriptures let's turn to
[11:38] john 16
[11:40] and continue our thought
[11:43] that we were talking about this morning
[11:44] from
[11:45] a positive attitude
[11:48] and we'll probably be using this for a
[11:50] while until we get a positive attitude
[11:54] and that's what the prophet said he said
[11:56] hold up something before the people till
[11:58] they get it
[11:59] then move on to something else so
[12:02] i pray that we'll
[12:03] do brother gary and i were talking the
[12:05] other day about it
[12:06] you'd have to be a minister sometimes
[12:08] especially a style that i use or more of
[12:11] the teaching style i guess and i get in
[12:14] a series and
[12:15] and you know i run for a while in that
[12:18] series
[12:19] well it's not too bad when you first
[12:21] start because you know you're getting
[12:23] started and you're learning and you're
[12:24] going you know you've got more more more
[12:26] services and things
[12:28] but when you come down to the end and
[12:29] you're getting about the last one
[12:32] and you don't know where you're going
[12:34] next
[12:35] that gets desperate you know you start
[12:38] to undoing but
[12:40] you know i've never had it for the lord
[12:42] to fail me yet but
[12:44] i've
[12:45] had that confidence in him and i'll keep
[12:47] that
[12:48] to give me another thought and just
[12:49] carry on
[12:51] as we try to move on all right but
[12:53] remember now that uh
[12:54] wade will be preaching first wednesday
[12:57] remember the bible study
[12:59] will be saturday six o'clock we're in
[13:01] the book of
[13:03] romans and we're just taking the
[13:05] scriptures and going along talking on
[13:07] them and really enjoying doing that so
[13:10] come and be with us and you know like
[13:12] and remember the to the brothers
[13:14] remember the
[13:16] uh men's gatherings or we'll go and have
[13:19] a few days of fishing and
[13:21] time together and all like that and we
[13:23] pray that
[13:24] you'd be able to come and go with us
[13:26] when we have a good time
[13:27] all right
[13:29] john 16 so let's pray
[13:32] the heavenly father we thank you lord
[13:34] that we have an opportunity
[13:37] to be able to come before a living god
[13:40] not to be an idol
[13:43] or a thought or an idea
[13:45] or a concept of somebody
[13:48] but to stand before a living true god
[13:53] the only true god
[13:55] the only one
[13:57] we can stand there and knowing
[13:58] confidence in our heart that
[14:01] thou art christ and you're still alive
[14:04] and we're just depending upon that lord
[14:06] and
[14:07] we place everything we've got upon it
[14:10] because there's nothing left over
[14:12] it's all in you
[14:14] we pray that you would just help us now
[14:16] to speak as you have given it unto us
[14:19] and then giving it unto us because we
[14:21] love to do that lord and talk about you
[14:23] when you come on the scene even in our
[14:25] own
[14:25] things and thoughts and ideas and begin
[14:28] to speak to our heart we love you and we
[14:30] pray that you this guy bless each one
[14:32] that's not here remember the sick among
[14:34] us
[14:35] you promised it so we believe you just
[14:37] come on the scene and take away the
[14:39] sicknesses and things and guide us into
[14:42] your love
[14:43] we love you and we thank you forgive our
[14:45] sins
[14:46] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[14:48] guide us in you in jesus name
[14:51] amen
[14:52] john 16 we'll read
[14:55] starting at verse 25. you know it's this
[14:58] is where he's coming down he asked
[15:00] anything in my name
[15:01] uh you know ask the father in my name
[15:03] and he'll give it unto you
[15:06] then he says these things have i spoken
[15:08] unto you in proverbs
[15:11] but that the time cometh when i shall no
[15:13] more speak unto you in proverbs
[15:17] but i will show you plainly of the
[15:19] father
[15:21] at that day
[15:23] you shall ask in my name
[15:27] and i say unto you that i will pray the
[15:29] father for you
[15:31] for the father himself loveth you
[15:35] and because you have loved me
[15:37] and have believed that i came out from
[15:40] god
[15:41] i came forth from the father
[15:44] and i'm coming to the world again i
[15:47] leave the world
[15:48] and go to the father
[15:50] his disciples said unto him lo
[15:53] now speak us thou plainly
[15:56] and speak us no proverbs
[15:58] now we are sure that thou knowest all
[16:00] things and need us not that any man
[16:02] should ask thee
[16:04] by this we believe that thou came us
[16:06] forth from god
[16:08] jesus answered them
[16:11] do you now
[16:12] believe
[16:14] do you now believe you may be seated the
[16:16] lord add his blessing
[16:18] to the reading of the word
[16:21] now
[16:24] we're talking about faith
[16:27] talking about a
[16:30] positive attitude
[16:34] we went through this morning speaking
[16:35] about peter and
[16:37] how that he was
[16:39] doing fine walking on the water until he
[16:41] got to looking at the circumstances
[16:43] around him
[16:45] and as he did he began to doubt and he
[16:47] lost his substance
[16:49] that he himself could walk on
[16:52] you know he didn't have to have any help
[16:54] he didn't have to have somebody to hold
[16:56] him up jesus wasn't holding his hand
[16:59] things wasn't taking place he didn't
[17:00] have a big rope or something to hold on
[17:03] to
[17:04] he had something within himself
[17:08] that
[17:10] was holding him up
[17:12] all right
[17:13] but then something happened
[17:16] and as it happened
[17:18] he lost that
[17:21] that was holding him up
[17:24] now
[17:26] he never lost his confession because he
[17:28] said lord help me
[17:31] you know save me
[17:34] he still had his confidence in him he
[17:35] could still look and see him he could
[17:37] still
[17:38] think about who he was and
[17:40] what he was
[17:42] and that's why we just moved over a
[17:44] little bit using this scripture that
[17:47] you know you you come to the time in the
[17:48] disciples lives that
[17:53] they finally said
[17:56] we believe
[17:59] we believe that you you come from god
[18:04] and he said do you now believe
[18:08] well then my mind runs over to another
[18:10] scripture that
[18:11] has always been helpful to me in
[18:13] thinking but it's talking about the end
[18:15] time and said
[18:17] will he find faith
[18:20] in all of the earth
[18:24] you know
[18:26] will he find a substance in the end time
[18:30] that
[18:34] somebody's going to have to walk off
[18:35] this earth on
[18:38] because we're all as believers
[18:41] are looking for a rapture caught away a
[18:44] time to leave this earth and things and
[18:49] we believe that we'll have to be changed
[18:51] and different things will happen but we
[18:53] also we're still looking
[18:56] for somewhere that somebody will come
[18:58] with the ability
[19:00] that death will not be able to destroy
[19:02] them
[19:03] or conquer them
[19:05] that they'll just walk right off the
[19:06] earth
[19:08] well you know
[19:10] we can look back and we can see that
[19:14] enoch walked off the earth one day
[19:17] that's what i want to get to on the
[19:18] positive attitudes and the things you
[19:20] know but you just walk right off the
[19:22] earth
[19:26] the prophet says that he pleased god
[19:28] with rapture and faith
[19:30] now
[19:32] we know that he did not have the new
[19:34] birth back there because the newton
[19:35] birth had not been given because jesus
[19:38] had not been glorified so there was no
[19:40] way for them to be able to be in the
[19:42] kingdom of god
[19:44] you know
[19:45] and that's why he would say that john
[19:47] the baptist was the greatest of all the
[19:49] prophets but yet the least in the
[19:50] kingdom is greater than john
[19:52] why because that the least in the
[19:55] kingdom has the new birth
[19:57] all right
[19:59] but what i want us to think about
[20:02] i want us to consider our thinking you
[20:04] know ourselves check ourselves
[20:10] do we have mental faith
[20:14] or do we have
[20:15] spiritual revelation
[20:18] now of course we make all of it as
[20:24] i guess you know try to make it
[20:25] spiritual revelation
[20:27] but there's a vast difference
[20:30] and i made the statement this morning
[20:31] that uh i want to make again and i'll
[20:33] probably make it in each service
[20:36] if you've never experienced something to
[20:39] happen to you
[20:42] that
[20:43] no way
[20:45] nobody could take it from you nobody
[20:48] could ever change you or whatever
[20:52] yet you just know
[20:55] that it's going to take place
[20:58] but if you've never had that
[21:02] you can you can make it look like you've
[21:04] had that because you can confess this or
[21:07] confess that and walk into it and
[21:10] something happened
[21:11] but remember jeannie dickinson was about
[21:15] 50 50 or 60 percent
[21:18] correct on her
[21:19] predictions
[21:21] well you know that means she's 50 or 60
[21:23] correct on a prediction you know what
[21:25] that means
[21:26] she's about
[21:29] 59.9 better than i am
[21:33] that might not be the right figures to
[21:35] use but you get my point
[21:38] she has some reason or way of knowing
[21:41] some
[21:42] things you have to admit it
[21:46] you know
[21:47] all right
[21:48] then there has to be a world out there
[21:52] that or whatever forgive me for no
[21:54] education to explain those things
[21:56] they've got to be a place or something
[21:59] that
[22:00] you can reach
[22:04] and a lot of people can reach that
[22:07] but around some people just can't
[22:09] have faith
[22:12] you know
[22:14] i mean you can tell people about things
[22:15] and like the old man always referred to
[22:17] that worked at the plant
[22:20] when they went to the moon he just they
[22:22] called him dozer and he built snuff and
[22:24] he said they didn't go to the moon
[22:29] they just went out in the desert
[22:33] you know
[22:34] well you know my point's only been you
[22:37] know i try to look at things funny but i
[22:40] mean if you can go up so far and come
[22:42] back down in the desert you've still
[22:43] done pretty good
[22:45] all he needed is being able to
[22:46] straighten the thing out and keep going
[22:48] the other way
[22:49] but see he just wouldn't believe it
[22:52] and you can tell people about things
[22:54] that happen in your life
[22:57] who do you think you are
[22:59] you think you're a prophet
[23:01] i mean i say i saw god when i was 11
[23:03] years old standing in the church you
[23:05] think you're prophet no
[23:07] i've denounced it publicly privately and
[23:10] everything i'm not a prophet
[23:12] no whatsoever
[23:15] all right
[23:17] but yet
[23:19] a lot of people's never seen things
[23:22] right and i understand that
[23:25] brother brown said you may never
[23:27] lay your hands on a person
[23:30] and feel a surge
[23:33] run through your body
[23:35] and see that person healed
[23:37] that you may never do that
[23:41] what are we going to say it doesn't
[23:43] happen
[23:46] because we don't believe it
[23:50] at least let me quote with the prophet
[23:52] he said if i might not be able to attain
[23:54] unto that place he said i don't want to
[23:57] hinder somebody else
[23:59] and they can attain all right
[24:01] now
[24:02] that's a pretty good statement for a man
[24:04] to make in his category
[24:07] of what he saw
[24:11] but what about it
[24:16] we're going to deal mainly for this
[24:18] part of the message and maybe
[24:20] another one or something
[24:22] more or less into the mental
[24:25] part and i i put it in here to make sure
[24:27] to cover
[24:29] when peter lost his substance
[24:33] remember you're not talking about the
[24:35] new birth
[24:37] you know yeah
[24:39] now there's no way to be born again and
[24:41] then be lost
[24:43] i i i
[24:45] you know if you're ever truly born again
[24:47] substance faith new birth there's no way
[24:50] to be lost
[24:52] so we're not referring to that
[24:55] we're referring to just us
[24:59] you know
[25:00] it's now where we're at
[25:03] talking about mental faith
[25:08] remember as i said this morning
[25:11] there's no way to have a
[25:14] supernatural
[25:16] spiritual
[25:18] revelation
[25:21] without it being first a mental thought
[25:26] even though you say well nobody didn't
[25:28] tell me that
[25:32] you got it somewhere
[25:34] you heard somebody say
[25:37] well see you're trying to impress
[25:39] and impressions don't work too good
[25:41] especially with me
[25:43] i'm just
[25:44] i reckon i've just been made that away
[25:47] i've had people to
[25:48] say things and i just say well just tell
[25:50] me
[25:51] you know because
[25:53] if i believe it
[25:54] i'm going to put everything i can behind
[25:56] it
[25:58] you know
[25:59] and i'm going to stand on that
[26:02] even if i stand by myself
[26:05] you know
[26:07] i was referring to it at lunch while ago
[26:10] with someone but my wife we was up in
[26:12] the garden one day and i told her
[26:13] something was going to happen
[26:15] she said it ain't going to happen
[26:17] i said if it don't happen i won't preach
[26:19] no more
[26:20] that's how much confidence i had in the
[26:23] situation and she said well
[26:25] i mean that was her you know she said
[26:27] you preached your life sermon
[26:30] well
[26:31] that was her
[26:33] but it took place
[26:37] and see i could put my faith in
[26:39] god
[26:41] i wish i couldn't everything
[26:44] i've always said i could i can
[26:49] i have one thing that came to me years
[26:51] ago that
[26:53] if you just tell me say
[26:56] and i know it drives most ministers
[26:57] haywire but
[26:59] you just say i want you to preach on the
[27:01] new birth
[27:04] well there's just an ability there that
[27:06] just goes into that
[27:08] or others say i've got to have an
[27:09] unction
[27:10] a leading i know i understand that i
[27:13] know that
[27:15] but
[27:16] if you know where you're at
[27:18] why can't you explain
[27:20] what you're talking about
[27:25] well yes you see preachers and they make
[27:26] a big show of
[27:28] i've got this thing but i can't explain
[27:30] it well shut up
[27:35] you you got banana pudding
[27:37] and you won't let me have none of it
[27:42] you know
[27:43] you got a big red watermelon
[27:46] yeah
[27:47] and you won't let me out no watermelon
[27:49] shout out
[27:52] but see that's an impression or they'll
[27:54] say i've got something right here i'm
[27:56] going to read it to yahweh
[27:59] well in that service they got something
[28:01] and they don't ever read i want to get
[28:03] the notes
[28:04] you know i'm honest i'm sincere
[28:09] but everybody's different and i know
[28:10] that
[28:12] but i know too the point that i've made
[28:15] if you've never experienced it
[28:20] you
[28:21] you don't know what anybody's talking
[28:22] about that has
[28:25] you know what
[28:27] if you'd never tasted of a watermelon
[28:32] you couldn't tell nobody what it tastes
[28:33] like
[28:35] right
[28:40] but the way we do in our human beings
[28:46] it makes me think of a little child
[28:50] it's an amazing thing to me now
[28:53] it may not be to you but this amazes me
[28:57] i always thought pneumonia was spelled
[28:59] with an n you know
[29:03] it's got it in there but it starts with
[29:05] a p
[29:10] but you know a little kid little jonas
[29:14] you know you can get him to say dog
[29:18] well now he's been around maybe he knows
[29:20] what a dog is or a cat or a cow or
[29:22] something you know
[29:23] he's beginning to get that part in his
[29:25] mind
[29:26] but before he gets it into his mind you
[29:29] can have him saying the word
[29:34] there's no way he could spell it
[29:36] he couldn't look at it written out and
[29:38] he couldn't even see it
[29:41] and be able to to do it it's trained you
[29:44] know constantly
[29:46] over and over
[29:49] well
[29:50] that's what i mean by if you've never
[29:52] experienced it
[29:56] if you've never been healed i mean
[29:58] healed and know it
[30:01] then you can't explain to somebody
[30:04] i mean you can't understand when they
[30:05] explain healing
[30:09] when something comes and just
[30:12] happens
[30:15] and you didn't have nothing to do with
[30:17] it
[30:21] you can't explain that
[30:23] only to a person that has had that to
[30:25] happen to them
[30:29] and i'm not trying to de-christianize
[30:31] nobody
[30:33] but i will say that i wish i could
[30:36] if you're not born again i wish i could
[30:38] preach to you
[30:39] enough that you would find out that
[30:41] you're not
[30:45] because that way you'd have something
[30:47] you could do about
[30:48] it if you keep on believing it
[30:53] saying it whatever
[30:56] without it being a real substance to you
[31:01] you know
[31:03] you've heard me talk about
[31:05] for two years that i
[31:07] and are coming in the message i never
[31:09] counted to new birth even though i was a
[31:11] a deacon for five years
[31:13] uh talked to sunday school classes
[31:16] in in the sunday schools
[31:18] the deacons and wild elders the older
[31:20] people
[31:22] yet i came into the message and i knew
[31:24] that immediately that i didn't have what
[31:26] brother branham was talking about
[31:31] and i set out seeking for it
[31:34] and i was reading constantly and just in
[31:36] a lot of respects just turned my family
[31:38] back
[31:39] and just barely made a living i don't
[31:41] mean i was laid out of work i mean i
[31:43] just went to work that was it but i've
[31:46] always worked i've never been a lazy
[31:47] person i can't do that i can't do it now
[31:49] my wife would say sit down
[31:51] can't do it
[31:53] well if i keep on doing that like
[31:55] terrence says that's keeping him from
[31:57] having to put me in that nursing home
[31:59] you know let me get out now
[32:01] but
[32:04] i've just always been that away
[32:07] you know that
[32:12] if christ is real to you
[32:15] why can't you explain it
[32:19] but yet if he's not real to the other
[32:20] person you can't explain it to him
[32:26] it takes
[32:27] doing and i know see
[32:29] i know what preachers do and i'm sorry
[32:31] i'm just
[32:32] talking okay
[32:35] you ever notice preachers they'll start
[32:37] out and they're looking here and they're
[32:38] looking there and they're looking here
[32:41] and they're looking there later wally
[32:42] look in there
[32:44] look in there
[32:46] yeah what's that
[32:48] what it is they picked up that spirit on
[32:50] that side
[32:51] that's the one they're talking to
[32:53] you know because that side's pulling
[32:58] there
[32:58] that pull is there
[33:00] you know trying to bring out into the
[33:02] open
[33:04] but i've just never been that way
[33:07] i'm just i get a shotgun all across the
[33:09] whole crowd
[33:11] you know
[33:12] i just just preached trying to believe
[33:14] and let it go
[33:17] because i know
[33:18] that if you don't have the experience
[33:22] then you don't understand
[33:25] see then that makes people think that
[33:26] i'm de-christianizing them
[33:30] no
[33:31] i'm trying to help
[33:35] i'm trying to help you
[33:38] paul said have i come become your enemy
[33:41] because i tell you the truth
[33:46] now here's a man that
[33:50] had to withstand a man that opened the
[33:52] doors to the jews and the gentiles
[33:56] right
[33:57] paul had to withstand peter to the face
[34:00] it was over a matter of her life it was
[34:02] a matter of peter not living up the way
[34:04] he should do it but he still had to do
[34:06] it
[34:10] well see you could get exalted on that
[34:11] point
[34:13] but paul never did
[34:15] but peter never was mad at him because
[34:17] he rebuked him
[34:18] he took that
[34:21] and allowed that to be able to build him
[34:24] until he would even say paul does say
[34:27] things hard to understand
[34:28] that some wrestle to their own
[34:30] destruction
[34:34] not a rebuke
[34:35] let's go to open the doors anybody's
[34:38] going to rebuke me there's got to be god
[34:39] himself because i'mma no
[34:45] well you realize how serious it is
[34:49] they even talk about christianity
[34:56] even talk about being a christian
[35:00] you realize when you're talking about
[35:03] that god has come to you
[35:06] and gave you a new birth
[35:10] that either one of the two things
[35:13] is
[35:14] right or it's wrong
[35:20] it's one of the two right
[35:22] there's no gray area
[35:25] you're either lost or saved
[35:29] and in doing that
[35:31] it's so hard to get people to think
[35:33] about
[35:34] the possibility of not being saved
[35:39] you never was there most of you in the
[35:40] baptist church but
[35:43] the baptist philosophy was that
[35:47] one reason they believed in a trinity
[35:50] is if i deny the father i'll deny the
[35:52] son because it says that over in the
[35:53] little john you know
[35:56] and see if i deny
[36:00] that i'm born again
[36:02] then i'm doubting i'm born again and i
[36:04] can't do that
[36:07] i've got to be positive
[36:10] you know
[36:11] that's good
[36:14] that's wonderful
[36:17] but when it's not real
[36:23] and i'm sorry
[36:25] it's the way i think
[36:28] i think most people in this message
[36:31] are just exactly in the same shape
[36:34] positionally wise
[36:37] in their salvation as we were when we
[36:39] were methodists baptist presbyterian
[36:42] pentecostals
[36:47] catholics
[36:49] whatever
[36:51] no brother dale we have the message
[36:54] what does that mean
[37:01] yeah but we're up above them how did we
[37:03] get up there
[37:09] do we still have the same old
[37:12] concept
[37:15] i believe
[37:17] that i'm saved
[37:20] and nobody can't tell me i'm not
[37:25] well by the fact what you just said
[37:26] you're admitting something wrong
[37:30] because you're getting upset
[37:32] about what somebody has said to you
[37:35] right right
[37:37] well you think i wouldn't be in bad
[37:39] shape if i put up with what people said
[37:40] about me
[37:43] i'd really be in bad shape if i took
[37:45] what they said about me you ain't
[37:47] nothing but an intellectual
[37:49] you know that's all right i say amen i'm
[37:51] intellectual that's right
[37:54] now where's your excuse
[37:57] you know
[37:59] if i'm an intellectual where's your
[38:00] excuse
[38:04] because it's got to be intellectual
[38:06] first
[38:08] at least
[38:09] i have the
[38:11] seed in the field
[38:14] if i'm not even
[38:16] saved i have the seed in the field
[38:21] what about people that don't accept no
[38:23] seed in the field
[38:28] well mama said i saved
[38:30] daddy said i say
[38:31] you talk to people and you don't even
[38:34] mention mama daddy uncle aunts brothers
[38:36] sisters nobody
[38:38] and you start talking to them your
[38:39] sister's especially about to hire the
[38:41] dress the clothes
[38:43] you mean my mama wasn't saved you ain't
[38:46] said nothing about mama
[38:50] you ain't mentioned mama
[38:55] see
[38:57] could it be that they see you have
[38:59] obtained something
[39:01] that mama didn't attain unto
[39:07] and if they beginning to worry about
[39:08] mama
[39:10] right
[39:15] you see there's a lot of difference
[39:16] between mental faith and
[39:18] spiritual revelation
[39:21] but it's so close together
[39:24] until we can stay in mental faith
[39:28] and not
[39:30] go on to seek god what is one of my
[39:32] favorite sayings
[39:34] i'd rather go through life
[39:37] seeking for god
[39:39] and come to the end of the road
[39:41] and find out i already had him
[39:44] and to go through life
[39:46] not seeking him and come to the end and
[39:48] find out i don't have him
[39:54] that's a bad situation
[39:57] but the reason i said that about
[40:00] people because
[40:02] well let's use an example i'm not going
[40:04] off on them but bragging on
[40:06] uh the speaker last night at the uh
[40:09] um
[40:10] sterling's graduation
[40:12] i thought he'd done a marvelous job
[40:15] and i did i thought he did a marvelous
[40:16] job
[40:18] now how could you tell him he wasn't
[40:19] saved
[40:26] i mean how could you go to him and tell
[40:28] him he wouldn't say
[40:30] now i'm not saying anywhere there is or
[40:32] not right right right
[40:35] i'm just saying he has a great
[40:37] uplift about him he has a great positive
[40:39] attitude
[40:43] and how could you tell him
[40:46] that he wasn't saved
[40:52] and even he's maybe seen signs wonders
[40:56] had great experiences
[41:00] right
[41:02] and what about it
[41:05] i'm just talking sensibly to you and i
[41:11] about
[41:13] looking at the word of god looking at
[41:15] life
[41:16] and seeing ourselves and just settle the
[41:19] problem
[41:23] we're building a time of saying
[41:26] i'm not supposed to say i'm sick because
[41:28] if i'm sick i'll get sick
[41:33] what am i supposed to say
[41:37] i'm not sick
[41:39] well don't go to the doctor
[41:42] yeah but i'm hurting
[41:45] no wait a minute wait just a minute now
[41:48] you goofed up
[41:49] you said you was hurting your folks say
[41:51] you're not hurting
[41:56] right
[42:00] if you're going to be positive be
[42:01] positive
[42:04] you know like the story was of the
[42:06] pillar you know telling about
[42:08] there was one of them christian science
[42:10] about positive
[42:11] you know went through the long story and
[42:13] the guy was telling the little boy said
[42:15] i said
[42:17] mama's not sick
[42:20] she just says she's sick
[42:23] she's not sick
[42:25] next day you seen him a little boy
[42:27] running where are you going he said i'm
[42:28] going to get the undertaker
[42:31] mama is not dead but she is dead
[42:36] you know
[42:37] she wouldn't confess it
[42:39] right
[42:41] but
[42:43] what about it
[42:48] i remember where i came from do you
[42:53] i remember when i had
[42:55] experiences
[42:57] in the baptist church
[43:00] and seeing god move and seeing things
[43:02] happen
[43:06] i didn't have to come into this message
[43:08] to
[43:10] learn to quit drinking and smoking and
[43:11] running around with women
[43:15] because he wasn't doing that then
[43:20] i always believed if you're going to be
[43:22] a christian you're supposed to be a
[43:23] christian
[43:25] a bad failure i agree
[43:27] but that's what i believed
[43:30] when i come in this message the thing
[43:32] that caught me
[43:33] was the word the man
[43:36] said
[43:39] that wrong down in my heart
[43:44] of the word that he brought
[43:46] amen
[43:48] because i always longed to see god
[43:52] and i heard a man talking about a god
[43:55] that to him was real
[43:57] he was not one of those
[44:00] i hope i'm saved maybe i'm saved i
[44:01] believe i'm saved now get over there
[44:03] i'll know for sure
[44:08] right
[44:09] you ever been there
[44:12] well what about it
[44:17] you've got to have a mental faith
[44:22] before it can become a spiritual
[44:25] revelation
[44:29] because according to the bible says
[44:31] faith cometh by hearing
[44:34] and hearing by the word all right
[44:37] now
[44:41] when i talk about it i've come to this i
[44:43] want to read it again
[44:45] when we talk about peter
[44:47] having a substance and losing it but yet
[44:50] still having this confession i'm not
[44:52] talking about the new birth
[44:55] but i don't believe you can be born
[44:57] again and lost i don't believe that now
[45:02] but i believe we can talk about healing
[45:06] and we have to relate it to salvation
[45:09] but we can talk about healing
[45:13] that in healing
[45:15] you can be healed today
[45:18] and die tomorrow
[45:20] with the same thing
[45:23] you believe that that's what your
[45:25] prophet said so that's right
[45:28] because healing is not on an eternal
[45:31] basis
[45:34] healing is a temporary form
[45:37] that's why anybody in the world can
[45:39] receive healing
[45:41] whether they're christian or not brother
[45:42] brown said
[45:43] god said jesus visits the jews every day
[45:45] and heals them and them not even
[45:47] accepting him
[45:49] all right
[45:54] but think
[46:00] i do believe that
[46:02] i said you interrelated i've got it in
[46:04] the second message to do it
[46:06] that
[46:07] i believe you can be justified
[46:10] and your sins forgiven
[46:14] and be lost
[46:17] because you can lose it
[46:20] i believe you can be sanctified
[46:25] and walking truly in it
[46:28] and still be lost
[46:32] but i do not believe you can be truly
[46:34] born again
[46:37] by the new birth of eternal life
[46:39] and never be able to lose that
[46:42] all right
[46:44] but you can be in all the others so we
[46:45] just kind of stay in that realm see
[46:47] then we'll get up into
[46:50] uh substance faith
[46:52] in the others now remember
[46:54] that jesus had not been glorified so the
[46:58] disciples couldn't really have perfect
[47:00] faith if you don't go to the message
[47:02] perfect faith you'll find that statement
[47:04] the little woman there to well are not
[47:06] the wealthy little woman that touches
[47:08] him of his garment
[47:09] i'm sure it's in that message
[47:12] he uses this
[47:13] phrase
[47:14] that she had faith for the time
[47:20] and she was healed
[47:22] faith for the time
[47:24] all right so then those people that were
[47:27] not born again and the people today that
[47:29] are not born again
[47:31] can be healed by faith by believing
[47:37] it's a faith for the time
[47:41] because
[47:43] they look at it they believe it
[47:45] and that to me is what i'm talking about
[47:46] this morning
[47:48] peter had the substance he walked on it
[47:51] but when he stepped back to mental faith
[47:54] it was so close
[47:56] to a spiritual revelation
[47:59] till the only difference you've got
[48:01] i hope you were listening
[48:04] the only difference you've got in peter
[48:06] from here
[48:08] to here
[48:10] here he's got a substance he's walking
[48:12] on water by himself
[48:14] no one holding him
[48:17] but then he loses that substance
[48:23] but he still has his confession
[48:26] and as he does jesus takes his hand and
[48:29] he walks right into the boat
[48:32] that's pretty close isn't it
[48:36] you follow me that's pretty close isn't
[48:38] it
[48:39] the one time he was walking next time
[48:41] he's walking
[48:44] but remember one time he had something
[48:46] he could stand on by himself
[48:53] the next time
[48:55] he had to have help
[48:59] right
[49:01] the difference between mental faith
[49:03] and spiritual revelation
[49:07] is spiritual revelation does not have to
[49:09] have any help
[49:13] you don't have to have no agreement with
[49:15] a doctor for you to be able to say
[49:17] you're healed if god shows you you're
[49:18] healed
[49:20] you don't have to have nobody helping
[49:22] you
[49:22] as a matter of fact
[49:24] it's better off for the doctor to say
[49:27] you're not
[49:30] but it makes you stand
[49:35] we'll get to this about four services
[49:37] down the road
[49:38] substance faith doesn't need anything to
[49:41] put it on
[49:45] you don't have to have when it happened
[49:47] here or it happened there it's done this
[49:50] with somebody else or it's done this
[49:51] before in me you don't have to have that
[49:55] he stands
[49:57] you remember the prophet talking about
[49:59] an eagle said he stands alone said he
[50:01] struts
[50:03] you don't have to have company
[50:07] can we do that
[50:14] but see peter now follow me
[50:17] as we start reading
[50:21] peter
[50:22] could walk himself
[50:26] and they say benny hen is that the right
[50:28] one now
[50:29] it's one bitty hand that stepped out in
[50:31] the mid iron walked off into the
[50:34] i believe it
[50:37] you know
[50:38] i believe it
[50:40] i believe he could do that
[50:43] what
[50:44] if a man can walk on red hot coals
[50:47] and it's not burning
[50:49] i don't have very much problem believing
[50:51] other things
[50:53] right
[50:59] but think about it
[51:01] the difference in peter now
[51:04] he could walk by himself
[51:06] second stage he had to have help
[51:13] substance faith will walk alone
[51:16] whereas mental faith you have to have
[51:19] company
[51:23] something to prop it up with
[51:26] we should write that down
[51:28] because i just saw it
[51:32] see the difference between mental faith
[51:34] and the spiritual revelation then
[51:38] let's read a few things brother ryan
[51:40] said about mental faith
[51:43] and see how close mental faith can be
[51:46] right now
[51:48] if they didn't give you this one most of
[51:50] you don't have these these are the notes
[51:52] from this morning go ahead brother
[51:55] anderson no not backer brother joe never
[51:57] goes back to the number two
[52:00] earnestly contending for the faith that
[52:01] was once delivered to the saints 1953
[52:03] 614
[52:05] e73
[52:07] my brother it's by faith you're saved
[52:10] is that right
[52:12] but listen
[52:14] in accepting of your
[52:16] faith god confirms your faith
[52:20] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:29] if you say you believe
[52:31] and you don't get the baptism of the
[52:32] holy ghost
[52:35] then
[52:37] you
[52:38] do not
[52:40] it your faith isn't accepted
[52:43] in the sight of god
[52:50] now is that blown enough
[52:56] maybe some of you think about whether
[52:57] i'm born again or not
[52:59] think about that
[53:01] remember
[53:03] it's not whether you accept him or not
[53:06] it's whether he accepts you
[53:13] but i've been taught all of my life all
[53:14] i had to do was accept jesus christ as
[53:16] my savior
[53:20] well that was good enough for mama and
[53:21] grandmother
[53:23] all of them
[53:25] i think it's time for us to weed out
[53:27] some of that and begin to
[53:29] think about ourselves
[53:34] but watch
[53:36] you say you believe
[53:38] and don't get the baptism of the holy
[53:40] ghost and you do not it your faith isn't
[53:43] accepted in the sight of god
[53:44] you've got a mental faith
[53:49] and in the stead
[53:52] of a heart faith
[53:55] i never noticed he had said those things
[53:56] until i started running this and it
[53:58] surprised me how much he would talk
[54:00] about a heart faith
[54:01] because we know that you know we're not
[54:03] born again and up our head
[54:05] but how many times he would really talk
[54:07] about a heart faith and the old saying
[54:09] is if i could just get that from coming
[54:10] up here about 16 inches down you know
[54:14] into my heart then it could be quickened
[54:17] but look at him he talked about a heart
[54:18] faith
[54:20] you've got a mental faith and in the
[54:22] state of a heart faith that's right
[54:24] when you truly believe god god's under
[54:26] obligation to pour the holy ghost on you
[54:30] and then if he does pour the holy ghost
[54:32] on you
[54:33] you say well
[54:35] i've got the holy ghost well if you do
[54:39] you're bound to believe in the
[54:41] supernatural signs and wonders
[54:43] because you're added to it that's
[54:46] faith
[54:48] all right
[54:51] a heart faith
[54:55] instead of a mental faith
[55:02] and if you've ever had it you know the
[55:03] difference
[55:06] but if you've never had it
[55:07] you don't know
[55:10] well brother dale
[55:13] i don't know whether i'm saved or not
[55:15] there's just no hopes for me
[55:17] i don't know whether i'm predestinated
[55:19] or not that's what they preach
[55:23] you see what these preachers has done
[55:25] with their doctrines
[55:28] they preached a predestinated
[55:30] calvinistic doctrine
[55:33] amen
[55:34] and got the people to where they don't
[55:36] really know
[55:38] what predestination really is
[55:42] if god's seeing me say i'll be saved but
[55:44] if he didn't see me safe i'll be lost
[55:47] well you know what you're saying i'm
[55:48] lost
[55:51] you just said just lost
[55:55] so we solved the problem
[55:57] you lost
[56:00] huh
[56:04] well now if you're lost what are you
[56:05] going to do
[56:09] step one repent
[56:13] be baptized in the name of the lord
[56:14] jesus christ
[56:17] walk into sanctification
[56:20] and believe all the way to the baptism
[56:22] of the holy ghost
[56:29] what are you doing man
[56:31] just follow the steps
[56:33] amen
[56:35] just walk in what god reveals
[56:40] on the brother david the other day we're
[56:41] listening right around we're talking
[56:42] about a little boy 12 or 13 you're a
[56:45] person 12 or 13 years old
[56:47] wondering if they should be re-baptized
[56:52] and he explained it he said
[56:55] you know if he was baptized correctly
[56:58] it's not necessary
[57:00] for you to be baptized again so that's
[57:03] because you baptized correctly
[57:05] said even though you would even go out
[57:07] and go wrong
[57:08] you know
[57:09] and do things he said it's not
[57:11] necessarily that you have to be baptized
[57:14] but then he made an outstanding
[57:15] statement that
[57:17] he's always dwelt within me of knowing
[57:19] what he's taught
[57:22] he said we face any doubt in your mind
[57:24] whatsoever
[57:27] any hindrance whatsoever
[57:29] he said
[57:30] i would go get baptized
[57:35] see if the devil's making you doubt
[57:37] whether you're born again or not
[57:40] we'll have a baptismal service this
[57:42] afternoon
[57:47] well i've been baptized i have two three
[57:49] times
[57:52] one time father son holy ghost
[57:55] one time in the name of the lord jesus
[57:56] christ and one time in the river jordan
[57:59] in israel
[58:00] and if i went back tomorrow i'd go get
[58:03] baptized again in the river
[58:06] jordan we get out of the crowd of
[58:09] 20-something of us
[58:11] there were four of us
[58:12] in the baptismal service the other said
[58:15] we've already been
[58:20] baptized it wouldn't be any doubt in my
[58:23] mind it'd just be i'd like to get back
[58:25] in the water i'm kind of like old
[58:26] brother willie ross he told that time
[58:28] they had got baptized down he was you
[58:30] know brother willie ross from down
[58:32] prairie georgia i think
[58:34] and him and old brother solomon he said
[58:36] they done been baptized named the lord
[58:38] jesus christ and they went up to the
[58:39] tabernacle now that's what he was
[58:41] telling him he said
[58:43] he said
[58:44] solomon did they gonna have a baptismal
[58:46] service this evening
[58:49] he said solomon said well we've done big
[58:50] baptized he said
[58:52] just don't tell nobody
[58:54] he said we're going back again
[58:55] we're going to get some more
[58:57] well
[58:59] anything to do i baptized a lot of you
[59:01] over
[59:02] that was baptized correctly and done all
[59:04] this and the other maybe i even baptized
[59:07] you the first time
[59:09] but if you got any doubt in your mind
[59:11] start from scratch
[59:16] just simply say lord
[59:18] i don't know whether i'm born again or
[59:20] not come and save me
[59:25] let me do this
[59:27] get right
[59:32] why because i don't know what nothing
[59:33] hindered me
[59:37] let's read a little more
[59:40] this is taken from witnesses 1954
[59:45] e 21.
[59:48] you believe god would say believe
[59:50] you believe god and say you believe god
[59:53] and haven't received the holy spirit
[59:56] there's something wrong with your faith
[1:00:00] all right
[1:00:02] because god's under obligation to give
[1:00:04] every believer that repents and is
[1:00:06] baptized
[1:00:07] is under obligation to give you the
[1:00:09] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:00:13] and he's more willing to give it to you
[1:00:16] than you are to receive it
[1:00:21] that's right so there's something wrong
[1:00:23] somewhere
[1:00:27] you just got a mental faith
[1:00:30] instead of a heart faith
[1:00:34] where god's under obligation
[1:00:36] to keep his word
[1:00:40] heart faith
[1:00:44] mental faith instead of a heart faith
[1:00:48] mental faith is so close
[1:00:53] as i tried to illustrate it
[1:00:55] of peter
[1:00:57] being able to walk by himself
[1:01:00] but then in mental faith he had to have
[1:01:01] help
[1:01:05] right
[1:01:07] if you're born again you don't have to
[1:01:09] worry about it
[1:01:10] you know it
[1:01:13] but you say well brother dale can you
[1:01:16] have the new birth and doubt
[1:01:18] yeah
[1:01:20] i got a faithful saying
[1:01:23] just once in a while
[1:01:27] most of your life and know what i mean
[1:01:30] once every morning and a while every
[1:01:31] evening
[1:01:33] the devil tells me i'm lost
[1:01:36] he'll never talk to you about it
[1:01:39] no i won't even listen to it no because
[1:01:41] he's inside of you you're gonna listen
[1:01:43] to it he's inside of you he's on your
[1:01:45] side
[1:01:49] but what about it
[1:01:53] what about sister lois brother branham's
[1:01:55] daughter-in-law
[1:01:58] that received the holy ghost one night
[1:02:02] and he said the next night she was
[1:02:03] doubting
[1:02:05] you need that quote
[1:02:13] see it's not unbelief to
[1:02:16] have doubts come in your mind
[1:02:21] it's not total unbelief to have thoughts
[1:02:23] come into your mind
[1:02:28] brother said jesus was even tempted by
[1:02:30] women
[1:02:31] so it meant evidently there had to be
[1:02:33] thoughts come in his mind
[1:02:35] but yet he was not a sinner
[1:02:42] oh brother
[1:02:44] was in atlanta one day and he quoted
[1:02:46] what brother branham had said you know
[1:02:47] and i agreed with it
[1:02:48] he said you can't help the birds flying
[1:02:50] over your head but said you can
[1:02:52] keep them from building a nest in your
[1:02:54] hair
[1:02:55] now holiday men
[1:02:57] you know why because i've had a lot of
[1:02:59] nests try to start in my hair
[1:03:02] i think maybe most of us have
[1:03:07] if he ain't telling you
[1:03:10] that you're lost
[1:03:12] then that's one sure way of knowing you
[1:03:14] are lost
[1:03:19] brother dale you just don't preach like
[1:03:20] everybody else tell us how good we are
[1:03:23] and what this isn't
[1:03:24] yeah
[1:03:26] because if he ain't telling you you're
[1:03:27] lost
[1:03:29] he must be your buddy
[1:03:33] all right now there's another side to
[1:03:35] the coin too
[1:03:37] you know that brother random said where
[1:03:39] the devil used to tell you you're lost
[1:03:44] now he will tell you you are saved
[1:03:48] do you need that quote
[1:03:53] oh which side we
[1:03:56] on i'm just trying to be honest
[1:04:01] i meant for this like i said to be one
[1:04:03] sermon i was going to get two with it
[1:04:06] but just think
[1:04:12] you know
[1:04:17] mental faith
[1:04:21] we'll read in a minute where the prophet
[1:04:23] was talking about what i quoted this
[1:04:24] morning
[1:04:25] where he said a musician musician
[1:04:28] could take mental faith and break glass
[1:04:33] cheap magician's trick he called it
[1:04:36] ain't never been able to break a glass
[1:04:39] i certainly ain't able to holler
[1:04:42] high enough note to break one
[1:04:45] or a low enough one
[1:04:47] you know
[1:04:49] but that can be done right
[1:04:52] now if that can be done that means
[1:04:53] there's something wrong with waves or
[1:04:54] but that's the other part is getting
[1:04:56] into the mental faculties
[1:04:59] but just think about it
[1:05:02] he said there's something wrong with you
[1:05:05] he said because god's under obligation
[1:05:10] to give you the holy ghost if you
[1:05:12] believe
[1:05:16] well brother dale i believe
[1:05:21] yeah
[1:05:23] i believe
[1:05:26] i believe everything you say it
[1:05:31] i don't want you to believe what i say
[1:05:32] what you believe what he said
[1:05:37] he said he that it believeth
[1:05:39] be leave us
[1:05:41] and his baptized shall be saved
[1:05:43] he didn't say i believe
[1:05:46] that was why i read what the disciples
[1:05:47] said and he said do you now believe
[1:05:52] you know has it finally dawned on you
[1:05:54] that i must be something that i've tried
[1:05:56] all these years to tell you that i am
[1:05:58] that i'm god in human flesh
[1:06:02] and they said
[1:06:03] we believe
[1:06:09] go ahead to the next one let's just read
[1:06:10] a little bit of this
[1:06:12] i won't get but one or two more but
[1:06:16] this is taken from glorified jesus 1955
[1:06:19] to 25 paragraph e17
[1:06:22] now if you can look and live when you
[1:06:25] see the you're the gospel priest on the
[1:06:27] basis of the word that settles it
[1:06:29] you're healed right there but you cannot
[1:06:32] be healed by mental faith
[1:06:37] you've got to be healed by a real
[1:06:39] living faith
[1:06:41] from your heart
[1:06:47] well do you think that a sinner can have
[1:06:49] faith
[1:06:50] for healing
[1:06:51] yeah
[1:06:53] brother reynolds said prostitutes walk
[1:06:55] across the platform and be healed
[1:07:00] he said in real true christians come
[1:07:03] across and are not healed
[1:07:12] you got to be healed by real living
[1:07:13] faith from your heart
[1:07:15] no matter how much you worked up up here
[1:07:18] you know evidently
[1:07:19] no matter how much you disbelieve up
[1:07:21] here watch this one
[1:07:24] no matter if you get worked up it won't
[1:07:25] work
[1:07:26] but if you really got it now listen what
[1:07:28] he's saying here
[1:07:30] no matter how much you disbelieve up
[1:07:32] here
[1:07:33] if something down in down here tells you
[1:07:37] it's over
[1:07:38] it's over
[1:07:41] i turn one paragraph he's covering two
[1:07:42] things right
[1:07:48] no matter how much you disbelieve it up
[1:07:50] here if something down here tells you
[1:07:52] it's over it's over that's all that
[1:07:54] settles it there's no more fear at all
[1:07:57] there's one thing we'll stop in a second
[1:08:01] nobody
[1:08:02] could tell you any different
[1:08:07] you don't know why
[1:08:09] you believe it
[1:08:12] right
[1:08:14] it's not reason
[1:08:17] it's faith
[1:08:19] you just believe it
[1:08:20] and that's the way it takes place
[1:08:22] you believe it and go on no matter what
[1:08:26] your senses or sense knowledge would say
[1:08:31] be all out of reason
[1:08:34] it was not a reason for abraham and
[1:08:35] sarah to have the baby but they believed
[1:08:37] it anyhow
[1:08:39] it's all out of reason
[1:08:41] to have a man to stay alive in the belly
[1:08:44] of a whale
[1:08:48] but he did anyhow
[1:08:50] it's all our reason for a man to raise
[1:08:53] one from the dead
[1:08:55] but he did it anyhow
[1:08:57] see yes it is
[1:08:58] it's true
[1:08:59] it's not reason it's faith
[1:09:08] it's not reasoning
[1:09:12] it's not
[1:09:13] remember i said i want to talk on that
[1:09:15] fear
[1:09:21] we think we have faith
[1:09:24] but we're afraid
[1:09:29] we have fear
[1:09:34] right
[1:09:35] we have doubts frustrations now wait a
[1:09:38] minute brother there you just said that
[1:09:40] the devil could come and talk to us yes
[1:09:42] he can
[1:09:46] but there's a difference in the devil
[1:09:48] talking to you and really being afraid
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:56] really having fear
[1:09:59] if you're at torment
[1:10:01] right
[1:10:04] well brother dale when when others
[1:10:06] preach i feel so saved
[1:10:09] and you preach i feel so lost
[1:10:15] well
[1:10:17] i'm
[1:10:18] i'm not trying to make you lost
[1:10:25] but if you lost why wouldn't you want
[1:10:27] somebody to tell you you're lost
[1:10:32] how many have you ever been lost in the
[1:10:34] woods
[1:10:36] yep
[1:10:37] maybe i have a dozen
[1:10:42] when you're lost in the woods you don't
[1:10:43] know which way to go
[1:10:45] if you did you wouldn't be lost
[1:10:50] right
[1:10:55] i always talked to kids going hunting
[1:10:58] okay boys
[1:10:59] what's the way we're going in what's the
[1:11:01] way the sun is rising and which way if
[1:11:03] it's right over here you know it's gonna
[1:11:05] sit over there
[1:11:07] so
[1:11:08] if you're going out in the middle of the
[1:11:10] day don't go right away
[1:11:13] go the way
[1:11:14] it rolls
[1:11:16] you know
[1:11:17] what
[1:11:19] i said find you a branch a river or
[1:11:22] creeks whatever
[1:11:25] and follow that
[1:11:27] it may be a long walk
[1:11:29] but somewhere it's going to cross the
[1:11:31] highway
[1:11:34] right
[1:11:36] but if you're lost you don't know which
[1:11:37] way to go
[1:11:40] you just don't even know which way to
[1:11:42] turn
[1:11:43] you know what's the best thing to do sit
[1:11:44] down
[1:11:49] this set i am
[1:11:51] let the sun come
[1:11:52] up and at least you can follow it in one
[1:11:55] direction
[1:11:58] but you see if you don't admit you're
[1:12:00] lost
[1:12:01] you remember brother branham
[1:12:03] now
[1:12:04] tell the story he did
[1:12:06] he said i'm a hunter lord i can't be
[1:12:07] lost
[1:12:12] right he took off a little bit he's
[1:12:14] right back the same place
[1:12:17] he finally said lord
[1:12:19] i'm lost
[1:12:23] he said i only have one hoax
[1:12:27] he said that's that wire
[1:12:29] that we've strung down through
[1:12:33] and said i'm gonna just put up my hands
[1:12:35] and walk this away
[1:12:37] now he didn't know which way to go he
[1:12:38] was just trusting god right
[1:12:42] the minute he caught that wire down the
[1:12:44] hill he went
[1:12:47] you see when you wanted mitch he lost
[1:12:53] when you want to make such a great
[1:12:55] impact on everybody else
[1:12:58] to talk about your salvation
[1:13:04] when you want to tell everybody about
[1:13:06] your great supernatural faith for
[1:13:08] healing
[1:13:15] who are you trying to impress
[1:13:21] you know what we're really trying to do
[1:13:23] is try to take that fear away remember
[1:13:24] this story
[1:13:25] a little boy whistling in the graveyard
[1:13:28] oh i'm not afraid i'm whistling
[1:13:32] he's whistling because he's afraid
[1:13:39] he's talking to a man one day
[1:13:43] i said
[1:13:44] it wouldn't matter to me to go out and
[1:13:46] lay down that graveyard and go to sleep
[1:13:47] yeah
[1:13:48] i couldn't go to sleep i gotta go sleep
[1:13:50] in a graveyard
[1:13:53] i said why ain't nobody gonna bother you
[1:13:56] i said it's the one place ain't got
[1:13:58] nobody gonna come
[1:14:02] brother harry said when he was in
[1:14:04] vietnam that's it that's where he went
[1:14:05] to sleep was in the graveyard because he
[1:14:07] wouldn't come in the graveyard
[1:14:10] when he gonna laugh during the graveyard
[1:14:12] today
[1:14:16] oh i heard something creaking he's
[1:14:18] raising over there
[1:14:20] you know what i mean right
[1:14:28] we're afraid don't know it
[1:14:33] that's why you see people come so long
[1:14:34] and go so far in this message then they
[1:14:36] drop out
[1:14:40] because they lose any abilities to be
[1:14:43] able to
[1:14:44] function
[1:14:46] just as a person lost in the woods loses
[1:14:48] all directional senses you do not know
[1:14:50] which is which way to go
[1:14:53] why they call it the end in death walk
[1:14:55] and why you would do that is unbeknowing
[1:14:57] to me but you'll start out and turn
[1:14:59] around right back in the same place
[1:15:03] look like a while you'd learn to say
[1:15:04] wait a minute i'm not turning left
[1:15:07] if anything i'm going right
[1:15:09] you know
[1:15:11] but
[1:15:14] the great thing of mental faith are
[1:15:16] spiritual revelation
[1:15:21] what is it
[1:15:26] let's read this next one
[1:15:28] uh
[1:15:32] all right let's go ahead with this one
[1:15:34] infallible word of god
[1:15:36] 1950.
[1:15:38] eight or six one
[1:15:40] just pray challenge your faith
[1:15:42] believe it with all your heart jesus
[1:15:44] said if thou canst believe all things
[1:15:46] are possible
[1:15:48] you believe he's raised from the dead
[1:15:49] now
[1:15:51] now you
[1:15:52] now have faith
[1:15:54] just say lord
[1:15:56] have mercy on me
[1:15:58] maybe my faith has been mental faith
[1:16:02] maybe it's been
[1:16:04] emotional but now let me calm down
[1:16:08] and let me believe you lord
[1:16:10] let me believe you
[1:16:12] maybe it's emotional
[1:16:14] you love god don't you
[1:16:17] well how could you be lost if you love
[1:16:19] god
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:25] don't you love him
[1:16:28] well how could you be lost if you love
[1:16:29] him
[1:16:32] just emotional
[1:16:36] and it's built on emotions right that's
[1:16:39] why what was your prophet one thing he
[1:16:40] was against
[1:16:41] not against alder calls like everybody
[1:16:43] says he was against the altar called he
[1:16:44] didn't believe he gave him until the day
[1:16:46] he died
[1:16:48] but what was he against
[1:16:50] an altar call
[1:16:53] like we used to do
[1:16:57] i was 18 years old
[1:17:00] my brother-in-law got killed in a car
[1:17:01] wreck
[1:17:03] my sister came to me in the church and
[1:17:05] walked down through the church and come
[1:17:06] to me and she said samuel you got to
[1:17:08] come to the altar and get saved i said
[1:17:11] you know jc it was my brother-in-law
[1:17:13] said you know jc was lost and went to
[1:17:15] hell
[1:17:17] well boy that was encouraging
[1:17:21] you know
[1:17:24] i've told you before about it i don't
[1:17:25] care to talk plain i had more confidence
[1:17:28] in his confessions of anything and yet
[1:17:30] he was just a person never knew he had
[1:17:32] any confession of being saved but i had
[1:17:34] better confidence than i did in her
[1:17:36] because she could steal the
[1:17:38] money off a dead man's eye
[1:17:42] he used to rob her husband out of his
[1:17:43] billfold and hide everything and do
[1:17:45] everything and
[1:17:49] but you know what that done to me
[1:17:51] that set something in me that i didn't
[1:17:53] like
[1:17:56] you ever heard brother brown make this
[1:17:57] statement sometimes you got to get over
[1:17:59] the church
[1:18:01] to be able to get saved do you need that
[1:18:03] quote
[1:18:05] i had to get over the church in
[1:18:07] churchiology
[1:18:09] where she was telling me that i need to
[1:18:10] come to hour and be saved
[1:18:13] because if i did not go into hell with
[1:18:14] her husband
[1:18:19] you know one day
[1:18:22] i come to a conclusion
[1:18:26] that
[1:18:28] i was not going to let the church people
[1:18:30] and doings stand in my way
[1:18:33] i told you before about it they'd come
[1:18:35] to talk to me about being safe and i
[1:18:36] tell them i said live a better life to
[1:18:38] your deacon board you want to argue with
[1:18:40] me about it
[1:18:44] and i did
[1:18:47] and he lost
[1:18:49] but you see it's emotional things
[1:18:52] mama was saying daddy would say you want
[1:18:54] to go to heaven with mama don't you
[1:18:57] that's why they'll stay over in that
[1:18:59] church
[1:19:00] why because mama was in that church
[1:19:02] right
[1:19:03] and they think you got to stay where
[1:19:04] mama was at
[1:19:09] emotional thing
[1:19:12] fear and emotions
[1:19:17] how strong is your faith
[1:19:21] look at this next one that we want to
[1:19:22] talk about for a minute and i'll quit
[1:19:25] call the messiah 1961 117
[1:19:28] e33
[1:19:30] here the other night i saw on the
[1:19:31] telecast of a man with psychic mental
[1:19:34] faith
[1:19:36] a glass of water and stood back and kept
[1:19:38] concentrating on that glass of water
[1:19:40] till it bursted
[1:19:46] just by concentration
[1:19:49] watching that glass of water
[1:19:51] and the glass cracked and the water run
[1:19:53] out
[1:19:54] just pure mental
[1:19:57] consecration
[1:19:59] why
[1:20:00] that's his fibers
[1:20:06] that's his makeup
[1:20:08] if he can do that got a power in him by
[1:20:11] mental thinking that can break a glass
[1:20:13] of water and him be in the center
[1:20:16] that shows that there was something made
[1:20:19] in that man
[1:20:21] something different about that person
[1:20:24] he's in a fallen fallen perverted
[1:20:26] condition
[1:20:27] but if that man can only get back to god
[1:20:31] and let god get into him
[1:20:34] why with that power turned loose
[1:20:37] of the kingdom of god
[1:20:40] watch him
[1:20:41] he didn't have no conductor
[1:20:44] he talked about the guy you don't break
[1:20:46] the glass listen to it
[1:20:48] he was like a shotgun
[1:20:52] he just splattered everywhere what's he
[1:20:54] talking about
[1:20:57] he had no
[1:20:58] reasons no point of what he was doing
[1:21:02] to be faith
[1:21:03] but he just had an ability to believe
[1:21:06] but if that spirit that's in a man can
[1:21:09] be converted
[1:21:10] and put christ in there or he's got to
[1:21:12] conduct conductor a conductor is a wire
[1:21:14] that conducts it amen and let a man with
[1:21:17] that same faith in the conductor of the
[1:21:19] word of god
[1:21:22] he can raise the dead
[1:21:24] cleanse the lepers cast out devils amen
[1:21:27] he's fashioned like a god
[1:21:30] he looks like god
[1:21:32] sure was
[1:21:33] that's the reason god was in man
[1:21:36] man was god
[1:21:37] and this is his offspring
[1:21:40] man
[1:21:41] he's only trying to get a hold of man
[1:21:44] trying to get a man
[1:21:46] into his hands
[1:21:48] that man
[1:21:50] had an ability
[1:21:55] that man has an ability that other
[1:21:57] people don't know how most
[1:21:58] i can't do it ain't never done it
[1:22:01] what about you
[1:22:02] well i ain't never tried it
[1:22:04] i ain't either
[1:22:08] i don't want to do that because that's
[1:22:10] making the show
[1:22:12] you ain't listening
[1:22:14] this is your prophet
[1:22:16] telling you about it
[1:22:18] you mean you can say
[1:22:19] i don't believe that man breaking glass
[1:22:24] do you believe hebrews 13 8
[1:22:29] do you believe the seals
[1:22:31] that your prophet brought
[1:22:40] i've never been to worth it
[1:22:44] a witchdoctor doctor could drink blood
[1:22:47] and put a tent or pen on a table
[1:22:49] and it write an unknown tongue and
[1:22:50] interpret that of you
[1:22:54] what your prophet said he had
[1:23:00] you remember what he said when he faced
[1:23:02] him one time
[1:23:03] and they had a piano or something up in
[1:23:05] the air just floating there with your
[1:23:07] table or something
[1:23:13] i probably looked around him said let's
[1:23:14] see you do it
[1:23:19] he's not recorded in him did he tried to
[1:23:21] do it he done one thing
[1:23:24] he said let me try something
[1:23:27] he said in the name of father son holy
[1:23:28] ghost
[1:23:29] fall down
[1:23:32] he said that table just stayed up there
[1:23:36] the name of the roses here and he went
[1:23:37] through right
[1:23:40] in a minute he said let me try this he
[1:23:42] said in the name of the lord jesus
[1:23:44] christ he said the table went down
[1:23:46] i believe him don't you
[1:23:49] i believe it happened
[1:23:52] so that name of the lord jesus christ
[1:23:54] was greater than that power they had
[1:23:57] you remember when he was overseas and
[1:24:00] the storms came up and the tents was
[1:24:02] going
[1:24:03] and he just walked out there and he's
[1:24:05] peace be still
[1:24:10] he had a substance didn't he
[1:24:14] all right
[1:24:17] but look what he says about it and let's
[1:24:18] get that in real quick
[1:24:22] faith is the substance of 1947 7 12
[1:24:25] 8 37
[1:24:27] and he said now you believe with your
[1:24:29] heart he's talking about the little girl
[1:24:30] that was real sick
[1:24:32] they didn't know i believe it was
[1:24:33] appendix ruptured i think that's right
[1:24:36] they couldn't carry her her to where
[1:24:38] that they had to carry her too or
[1:24:40] whatever he said she's got to have faith
[1:24:42] immediately what it is just a little
[1:24:44] background of the story
[1:24:47] and i said now you believe with all your
[1:24:49] heart
[1:24:51] and you prove to me now
[1:24:53] that you got faith
[1:24:55] i don't have to prove i've got faith
[1:25:00] well why is your face read
[1:25:03] why are you upset
[1:25:06] why are you coming up with a thought
[1:25:11] we don't have to go out prove we got
[1:25:12] faith you know that's right
[1:25:15] because
[1:25:16] most of us don't have it
[1:25:21] but remember even the prophet
[1:25:24] the devil was moving him and he was
[1:25:26] getting smaller and smaller and smaller
[1:25:31] until he said i might as well try this
[1:25:32] out and he started booing back
[1:25:39] now you believe with all your heart you
[1:25:40] prove to me now that you've got faith
[1:25:42] now you're right directly at that
[1:25:44] bracelet
[1:25:46] and it hang in there and midair and you
[1:25:48] make that bracelet swing around and
[1:25:49] around in the room
[1:25:51] and you make it swing back and forth in
[1:25:53] the room and then stop it
[1:25:55] and i believe you have faith
[1:26:00] are you with me
[1:26:04] she said oh brother branham said my why
[1:26:06] ask me something like that
[1:26:11] i said i wanted to see if you had faith
[1:26:14] i said jesus said all things are
[1:26:15] possible
[1:26:16] if you believe
[1:26:19] now there's another one that i'll be
[1:26:21] able to i can look it up for you but she
[1:26:23] winds up and calls it some form of
[1:26:24] spiritualist
[1:26:26] ism you know
[1:26:28] wrong you know he said i know you'd say
[1:26:30] that
[1:26:30] look
[1:26:32] now that's just pure faith
[1:26:37] friends
[1:26:39] musicians
[1:26:42] magicians i'm saying
[1:26:44] musicians
[1:26:46] magicians
[1:26:48] use it many times to play pranks and so
[1:26:51] forth
[1:26:53] the same guy he's talking about breaking
[1:26:55] the glass
[1:26:59] break burst glasses and things
[1:27:01] he will if you believe but i'm trying to
[1:27:04] base your
[1:27:06] thought on faith
[1:27:09] so you know what i'm talking about
[1:27:13] i want you to sit
[1:27:14] still now so you'll catch this wake
[1:27:17] yourself up
[1:27:20] he went on to say
[1:27:24] he looked on that with his eyes
[1:27:26] and that bracelet went around and around
[1:27:29] backwards and forth and stopped
[1:27:33] right
[1:27:34] the little girl was healed
[1:27:38] now he says
[1:27:40] using it like they did
[1:27:45] something they could do
[1:27:49] how close
[1:27:51] is mental faith
[1:27:55] one more time i'll say it
[1:27:57] the difference
[1:28:02] substance faith peter walked by himself
[1:28:06] mental faith jesus had to hit him
[1:28:10] but you know he still walked
[1:28:13] he still walked
[1:28:20] think about it
[1:28:23] get ready for the communion
[1:28:27] mental faith
[1:28:29] whether you're talking about salvation
[1:28:31] or whether you're talking about healing
[1:28:35] you've got to have some way
[1:28:38] to anchor your thoughts
[1:28:42] all right
[1:28:43] so you anchor your thoughts on the word
[1:28:45] of god
[1:28:50] i said
[1:28:51] i was talking today about everything to
[1:28:53] go with somebody about brother branham
[1:28:54] one time were talking about and and
[1:28:56] billy pauler went to either of them
[1:28:57] brother branham was talking to her
[1:28:58] somebody would let me put it right
[1:29:00] somebody was talking
[1:29:01] anyway
[1:29:02] and he said well brother branham you
[1:29:04] told him he was healed
[1:29:07] he said what do you want me to tell them
[1:29:11] the bible says they're healed
[1:29:17] when i don't want to say something ain't
[1:29:19] right
[1:29:22] i'll be a liar
[1:29:25] don't worry about being one we're born
[1:29:31] we see we want to make it look so
[1:29:32] beautiful probably in front of everybody
[1:29:34] else
[1:29:37] we try to build up things
[1:29:40] like you know my comical point
[1:29:44] you got these weight lifters and things
[1:29:47] there's more muscles pulled
[1:29:50] in back problems and muscle pulls in
[1:29:52] front of mirrors
[1:29:55] and lifting 500 pound weights
[1:29:58] so you're only going to do that one time
[1:30:00] if you do it
[1:30:02] you get in front of that mirror
[1:30:06] anybody in here thinks you're ugly
[1:30:09] now don't raise your hand because i will
[1:30:10] call you a liar
[1:30:13] you look in the mirror
[1:30:14] and you don't believe you're as ugly as
[1:30:16] everybody else is ugly
[1:30:22] and no matter how old are you getting
[1:30:23] how more ugly you get you just lose your
[1:30:25] eyesight
[1:30:27] right
[1:30:32] mental faith
[1:30:38] now this is my life statement
[1:30:41] i don't like to talk this way but i like
[1:30:42] to tell the truth about it anyhow i am
[1:30:45] responsible for that part
[1:30:51] i believe the biggest portion of this
[1:30:53] world
[1:30:55] of over 500 million
[1:30:58] more than that now don't tell them what
[1:30:59] it used to be the catholic church used
[1:31:01] to have 500 million
[1:31:02] professing believers
[1:31:04] we don't put a number just say the
[1:31:06] biggest portion of this world
[1:31:08] claims to be christians
[1:31:12] one way or the other you know
[1:31:14] a lot of flim flames
[1:31:18] it's like that man told me at that time
[1:31:20] he said you mean to tell me
[1:31:23] he said there's 500 billion catholics
[1:31:25] that's that's what they say he said you
[1:31:27] mean to tell
[1:31:28] me that there's 500 million are wrong
[1:31:30] and you're right
[1:31:31] i didn't say that
[1:31:33] but the bible did
[1:31:39] that's what i told you mr bible because
[1:31:41] i followed him out
[1:31:43] what about billions of christians around
[1:31:46] the world
[1:31:52] in the biggest portion of our mental
[1:31:54] faith
[1:31:59] they spend their lives
[1:32:02] that's what i'm talking about
[1:32:05] spend their lives
[1:32:07] working
[1:32:09] serving
[1:32:10] a god
[1:32:12] that they do not know
[1:32:15] and haven't had a personal experience
[1:32:17] with him
[1:32:19] yet
[1:32:21] they'll die for what they believe
[1:32:27] now come on i'm not going off on nobody
[1:32:29] right
[1:32:31] but is it right when i say it
[1:32:34] is the biggest portion of the world
[1:32:36] going to
[1:32:38] heaven just because they say they
[1:32:41] believe in jesus christ
[1:32:50] is that all we've got
[1:32:55] a confession
[1:33:00] remember your prophet just said
[1:33:03] if he don't accept your
[1:33:06] confession you do not have the baptism
[1:33:09] in the holy ghost
[1:33:13] brother dale all you've done to me has
[1:33:15] made me the word i don't really know
[1:33:17] well we got that song that's right
[1:33:20] we got that solved
[1:33:25] now let's move on
[1:33:31] let's see god
[1:33:35] yes but if i admit i'm lost i'm lost oh
[1:33:38] god i don't know
[1:33:41] i don't know what to do
[1:33:47] i'm sorry
[1:33:50] have i become your enemy because i told
[1:33:52] you the truth
[1:33:57] it's what i've said this morning this
[1:33:58] afternoon the truth i'm not talking
[1:34:00] about my antics and ways and
[1:34:02] characters and things
[1:34:05] but it's what i've said to you about
[1:34:07] mental faith
[1:34:09] comparing it to spiritual revelation
[1:34:11] is it true
[1:34:15] and the prophet said in biggest portion
[1:34:16] we'll get to that later of our faith is
[1:34:19] mental faith
[1:34:25] but brother dale those people love god
[1:34:27] to do that
[1:34:28] rhetoric said
[1:34:30] people have a portion
[1:34:34] of these virtues
[1:34:37] and not even be born again
[1:34:42] there's some good people in this world
[1:34:48] there's good people just
[1:34:50] you know
[1:34:51] make you and i ashamed of ourselves
[1:34:56] but does that change god's word
[1:35:01] what about it
[1:35:06] a stand
[1:35:08] as we go into the communion
[1:35:15] i hope you understand me
[1:35:17] listen i'm talking about a positive
[1:35:19] faith
[1:35:22] a positive attitude
[1:35:28] talking about
[1:35:32] what god's word says
[1:35:38] and just asking a simple question
[1:35:43] do we know
[1:35:47] a man that did not have the new birth
[1:35:50] i've had to know certain lies didn't get
[1:35:52] that
[1:35:54] job
[1:35:56] he said i know my redeemer liveth
[1:35:59] you know what brother brown said
[1:36:03] he said i like that positive
[1:36:08] statement could i know
[1:36:12] doesn't mean you guess
[1:36:18] i hope
[1:36:21] it means something has went from this
[1:36:24] head
[1:36:25] down into your heart
[1:36:27] and you're speaking back out from there
[1:36:30] to say
[1:36:32] i know
[1:36:34] and there's nobody
[1:36:36] can take anything away
[1:36:41] now the kitchen the announcement
[1:36:44] to the sisters the kitchen
[1:36:47] you know
[1:36:47] sisters will be using the kitchen area
[1:36:50] room for foot washing
[1:36:54] to make it more disorders more
[1:36:56] comfortable for some
[1:36:58] with limited mobility
[1:37:01] they will unlock the doors when they are
[1:37:03] finished so don't try to go into dinner
[1:37:06] also following today's foot washing we
[1:37:09] will discuss a plan
[1:37:10] for activities and fellowship
[1:37:12] opportunities
[1:37:14] for the father's day weekend
[1:37:16] in the same room stay if you're
[1:37:18] interested you understand what it's
[1:37:20] saying
[1:37:21] the foot washing is going to be in the
[1:37:23] kitchen area
[1:37:24] because it'd make it more comfortable
[1:37:26] all right then after that there will be
[1:37:29] a meeting of the sisters someone talked
[1:37:30] about doing some things while we were
[1:37:33] gone on the uh
[1:37:36] men to their doings or something they've
[1:37:38] talked about doing some things
[1:37:41] and they'll be sitting and discussing
[1:37:43] that so brothers keep the kids outside
[1:37:46] stay outside until the doors are
[1:37:48] unlocked
[1:37:49] okay everybody got it
[1:37:51] all right
[1:37:52] let's go into her
[1:37:55] scripture first corinthians
[1:37:59] for i've received to the lord that which
[1:38:01] also i delivered unto you that the lord
[1:38:02] jesus the same night
[1:38:04] in which he was betrayed took bread
[1:38:06] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:38:08] and said
[1:38:09] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:38:11] for you it's due in remembrance of me
[1:38:15] after the same manner also he took the
[1:38:17] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:38:19] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:38:20] blood this dude is often as you drink it
[1:38:22] in remembrance of me
[1:38:24] or as often as you eat this bread and
[1:38:26] drink this cup you do shoe the lord's
[1:38:28] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:38:30] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:38:33] of the lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:38:35] of the body and blood of the lord
[1:38:37] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:38:39] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:38:41] cup
[1:38:42] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:38:43] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:38:46] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:38:48] body
[1:38:49] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:38:51] among you and many sleep
[1:38:53] where we would judge ourselves we should
[1:38:55] not be judged
[1:38:56] i love this one but when we are judged
[1:39:00] we're chasing to the lord
[1:39:02] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:39:03] world
[1:39:04] we're for my brethren when you come
[1:39:06] together to eat
[1:39:08] carry one for another and if any man
[1:39:10] hungry let him eat at home that you come
[1:39:12] not together under condemnation
[1:39:14] and the rest will i set in order
[1:39:16] when i come
[1:39:18] we come to a wonderful situation time
[1:39:21] communion
[1:39:24] i'm talking about your baptism with the
[1:39:26] holy ghost and that
[1:39:28] little brother said nobody had a right
[1:39:30] to take communion
[1:39:31] it wasn't born again
[1:39:34] well that's your choice
[1:39:36] you know if you do it i don't tell the
[1:39:37] deacons to pull back because they think
[1:39:40] somebody
[1:39:42] doesn't have it
[1:39:44] that's none of their business
[1:39:45] it's between that person and god
[1:39:48] all right
[1:39:49] but we do put it that way and believe it
[1:39:52] but let's just take a few moments to
[1:39:54] tarry one for another praying
[1:39:56] and you pray especially for me because i
[1:39:58] need it more than ever whatsoever
[1:40:01] in this life and day so let's pray
[1:40:22] just have your way lord down as we're
[1:40:23] going into the further part of the
[1:40:25] service
[1:40:26] we love you and we thank you
[1:40:28] sanctify the people that we may all be
[1:40:30] able to
[1:40:32] receive this that you have ordained for
[1:40:34] us to do
[1:40:35] we love you and we thank you
[1:40:37] in jesus name
[1:40:42] the bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:40:44] it lord jesus we ask you to breast bless
[1:40:46] this bread
[1:40:48] it's been made for this purpose today
[1:40:50] and now we come to that part so we ask
[1:40:53] you to just sanctify us
[1:40:56] and let this little people bread piece
[1:40:57] of bread just be a symbolic form but yet
[1:41:00] let it have a deep meaning in our heart
[1:41:02] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[1:41:05] name
[1:41:23] you know we believe in the word of god
[1:41:25] and believe
[1:41:27] i'm trying to do what it says
[1:41:29] but you know then people will turn right
[1:41:31] back around and
[1:41:33] say well
[1:41:35] why have you got to do this well you got
[1:41:37] to do that
[1:41:39] well the bible says to do it
[1:41:42] well i don't think it's that way i think
[1:41:44] it's
[1:41:45] it's from a sincere heart
[1:41:49] yeah i don't think your heart's too
[1:41:50] sincere
[1:41:52] but
[1:41:53] all that does because it hurt feelings
[1:41:56] and all of that
[1:41:58] but what about it
[1:42:03] what do we think
[1:42:04] about this part of being a christian
[1:42:08] of
[1:42:11] salvation
[1:42:13] well brother daley didn't understand
[1:42:14] these things down through time
[1:42:17] yeah
[1:42:18] but now
[1:42:20] it's come to a point that we're
[1:42:21] responsible
[1:42:24] to know these things
[1:42:26] because the end has come upon us
[1:42:29] and then we must know the truth
[1:42:32] and we thank god for the truth right
[1:42:38] father we ask you to sanctify this wine
[1:42:40] that's made for this purpose today
[1:42:42] lord just let it be as we eat a little
[1:42:44] piece of bread and drink the wine then
[1:42:46] it'll be blood cells in our body later
[1:42:48] on
[1:42:49] but yet let us see what these things
[1:42:51] mean
[1:42:52] this is not your blood
[1:42:54] but it's a symbol of it
[1:42:56] but a great symbol is so for us to take
[1:42:59] until you come we believe you and we
[1:43:01] thank you
[1:43:02] we committed to you now sanctify the
[1:43:04] wine and the partakers in jesus name
[1:43:07] amen
[1:43:14] come morning
[1:43:17] i walk
[1:43:19] by the river
[1:43:25] the ever
[1:43:27] green tree
[1:43:31] i'll carry
[1:43:33] my cross
[1:43:35] through the midnight
[1:43:39] come morning
[1:43:41] there's glory
[1:43:44] for me
[1:43:47] sometimes i'm
[1:43:49] despised
[1:43:51] and rejected
[1:43:55] and i question
[1:43:57] oh father
[1:44:00] how long
[1:44:03] then i take one more look
[1:44:08] at mountain
[1:44:10] free
[1:44:12] and it gives me
[1:44:14] the strength to
[1:44:17] go on
[1:44:19] come
[1:44:20] morning
[1:44:24] by the river
[1:44:27] i rest me
[1:44:30] the ever
[1:44:32] green tree
[1:44:36] i'll carry
[1:44:38] my cross
[1:44:40] through the midnight
[1:44:44] come morning
[1:44:46] there's glory
[1:44:49] for me
[1:44:52] what about those disciples when they
[1:44:54] first
[1:44:55] heard the lord jesus
[1:44:57] and he said this is my blood
[1:44:59] this is my body
[1:45:02] i'm sure they didn't understand
[1:45:06] evidently they never had real good
[1:45:08] clarity of
[1:45:10] all of this peace because like i said
[1:45:13] even those who experienced the lord
[1:45:15] jesus there
[1:45:16] and those who were with him and heard
[1:45:18] him and talking
[1:45:20] they were never chosen to explain
[1:45:23] the communion
[1:45:26] but the apostle paul that come along
[1:45:28] later one born out of due season
[1:45:33] he was chosen to explain the communion
[1:45:36] he could go back in the old testament
[1:45:38] bring it down
[1:45:40] peter didn't say now wait a minute paul
[1:45:42] wait a minute now i opened the doors to
[1:45:44] the gentiles and the jews
[1:45:46] i think ought to be the one to explain
[1:45:47] it
[1:45:49] he didn't
[1:45:52] peter june
[1:45:54] evidently he didn't have a clear
[1:45:55] understanding
[1:45:57] i don't believe they thought they were
[1:45:59] supposed to eat his body
[1:46:01] and drink his blood now we're not that
[1:46:04] far off
[1:46:06] i just don't think they understood
[1:46:09] do we really understand
[1:46:15] what these symbols
[1:46:19] you know
[1:46:22] well why do y'all put so much emphasis
[1:46:24] upon
[1:46:25] on the uh
[1:46:28] what a baptism or something
[1:46:32] because the word says it right
[1:46:37] and why would you emphasize it
[1:46:40] you know
[1:46:41] father son holy ghost is not right it
[1:46:43] needs to be done in the name of the lord
[1:46:45] jesus christ
[1:46:50] well you know
[1:46:54] if that's not true
[1:46:56] what about the rest of it
[1:46:58] it might not be true either
[1:47:03] hebrews 13 8 might not be true
[1:47:06] but if i believe hebrews 13 8 why
[1:47:07] wouldn't it want to be in the name of
[1:47:09] the lord jesus christ
[1:47:11] why would it not want to be
[1:47:15] sacred
[1:47:18] you remember the one brother branham
[1:47:20] when they were getting ready to baptize
[1:47:21] and some people was walking down into
[1:47:23] the water one of the ladies said
[1:47:26] oh you're going down and be dunked today
[1:47:28] see turn around told her said go back
[1:47:30] you're not worthy
[1:47:34] he sent her back says you're not worthy
[1:47:38] why because
[1:47:39] duncan or ducking or whatever wouldn't
[1:47:42] to be done
[1:47:43] if sincerity
[1:47:45] right
[1:47:47] everything should be sincere in god i
[1:47:49] know i like to life and talk and do yeah
[1:47:52] but when it comes to this word i'm
[1:47:54] sincere
[1:47:56] ain't no life and going on about this
[1:47:58] word
[1:47:59] i'm sincere
[1:48:00] i do that to keep you from drying up so
[1:48:02] much to where you won't be listening
[1:48:05] because it's hard to listen when your
[1:48:07] face is drawn down
[1:48:09] when you're going up at least your ears
[1:48:10] are open
[1:48:16] think on these things
[1:48:19] let's protect together
[1:48:31] you can be seated for a minute
[1:48:33] we're finishing up
[1:48:37] going to john for the reading
[1:48:42] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:48:44] now put into the heart of judas's carrot
[1:48:46] simon's son to betray him
[1:48:48] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:48:50] all things into his hands and that he
[1:48:51] was come from god and went to god
[1:48:55] he risen from supper and laid aside his
[1:48:56] garments and took a towel and dirty
[1:48:58] himself
[1:48:59] after that he poured water into a base
[1:49:01] and then began to wash the disciples
[1:49:02] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[1:49:04] wherewith he was girded
[1:49:06] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[1:49:08] saith unto him lord does thou wash my
[1:49:10] feet
[1:49:11] jesus answered and said unto him what i
[1:49:13] do i know it's not now
[1:49:15] but thou shalt know hereafter
[1:49:18] peter says unto him thou shalt never
[1:49:19] wash my feet
[1:49:21] jesus answered him if i was thee not
[1:49:23] thou has no part with me
[1:49:25] simon peter saith unto him lord not my
[1:49:28] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:49:31] jesus says unto him he that is wash
[1:49:34] and he does not save to wash his feet
[1:49:37] but he's clean every whip and you're
[1:49:38] clean but not all praying you who should
[1:49:41] betray him therefore said he you're not
[1:49:43] all clean
[1:49:45] so therefore
[1:49:46] excuse me so after
[1:49:48] he had washed their feet
[1:49:50] and had taken his garments and was set
[1:49:51] down again he said unto them know you
[1:49:53] what i have done to you you call me
[1:49:55] master and lord and you say well for so
[1:49:58] i am if i then your lord and master and
[1:50:01] wash your feet you also ought to wash
[1:50:03] one another's feet but i've given you an
[1:50:05] example that you should do as i have
[1:50:07] done to you
[1:50:09] verily verily i say unto you
[1:50:11] the servant is not greater than his lord
[1:50:13] neither he that is sent
[1:50:14] greater than he that sent him
[1:50:16] if you know these things
[1:50:19] happy are ye
[1:50:21] if you do then let's stand together
[1:50:23] father we just ask you to be with us now
[1:50:25] as we're going into the foot washing and
[1:50:27] as the sisters go downstairs for their
[1:50:29] time together lord and we pray that
[1:50:31] you'd bless each one we love you and we
[1:50:33] thank you forgive our sins
[1:50:36] make us clean in you lord and help us to
[1:50:38] walk in your love in jesus name
[1:50:41] amen you dismissed
[1:51:01] you
