bless you now let's all stand look into the scripture tonight and I'll pray for me I appreciate the appreciate the prayers I know we all need them so tonight we got got a fever get some prayer requests and but uh first thing I want to say is I like to like brother Dale's office the study looks really nice I don't know how many of y'all have been in there some of us have been in there but every time I go in I'm not in there you know tremendous amount of times but every time I go in there and sit down you know if you if you don't want the if you don't like the preacher you have the opportunity lock him in the room I just you know every time I go I didn't mention that last time but every time I walk in there it's like if you don't usually the blocks are on the inside so you keep people out you can keep the you can keep the preacher in there if you don't want him to come out so I don't know what the what the policy is I don't know what that is but you maybe the next time don't worry nothing started I was just wondering I mean that you something that brings questions to your mind you know but appreciate the Lord and this comes from brother Bob brother direct sent word that they are back from the Philippines and so thank the Lord for that but he said the family's not feeling well so y'all pray for them tonight and also keep praying for their house in maryland's that it'll sail so we just want to keep them in prayer and thank the Lord that he brought them back and had a gonna try to keep this brief and we are standing you know sometimes I don't know how y'all I talk about myself you walk around you get in this little melancholy atmosphere and you know you think you think you feel like Elijah in the cave you know Lord why don't you just just take me you know and you and you know the devil talks in both ear so just one Ares in both ears and you know sometimes you just feel like giving up and I know y'all probably don't feel like yet but but I do but uh you know you you fight that a lot and this week you know you're in your own little world and you feel this way and when somebody comes up to you at a man at work he coming and told me his his dad's almost 80 years old and had a stroke the other day and his sister the man that worked with his sister was just the man's daughter the man who had the stroke his daughter took him to the hospital from what I understand he had visible signs of a stroke they took him in there they started running scans and everything like that and while he was they were praying when they Eddie said that they started praying when they took him when he got there they run scans he had no signs of a stroke they run him from head to toe and the doctor told him said I know he had a stroke but they can't prove it none of their tests show that he had a stroke but he's almost 80 years old and there's the problem that he has right now it messed up his equilibrium he's walking with a walker and Eddie said to tell the church to pray for his dead and I said well you know what God ain't never done anything halfway and so just want to thank the Lord for that and you know that really gives you an uplifting but I have another lady that I worked with and she has a brother and a sister that both had cancer and I guess her sister has leukemia and they're looking for a bone marrow donor the family's being tested so far they hadn't come up with a donor for she asked me for us to pray and I said it certainly will she's got a lot of see how long hard road ahead of her financially not only not just you know and medically also and and also the lady that I work with her nerves are completely tore up and she so I keep trying to have faith and I was like well brother brems said you don't try he said you just do it they said there's no tribe to it and I said well you know you just got to cast down the Bible says cast down raising and Majan ations and everything because you know the devil is going to tell you what's going all these things that are gonna they're gonna be bad but you know the Bible is full of things that look they look bad for a lot of people and it didn't turn out bad so he's the same yesterday today and forever so we're gonna y'all just break that up and if I don't forget I won't take some prayer cloths to him so y'all remember y'all reminded me that we go and pray over these tonight so I want to take these with me too but uh I know sometimes I think about that and I forget so so yeah amen amen so we know that it's it's already finished it's a finished work of Calvary hey man so tonight we're gonna look in Luke chapter 5 read portion of Scripture and their knowledge he'll be seated and y'all just pray for me to not help me say what the Lord have us to say so let's just all bow our heads speak to the author tonight dear Heavenly Father and Lord Jesus we love you and we just thank you for all that you've done for us Lord them Lord we're just so thankful Lord that there is a fountain that we can go to for Lord to be clean in order to wash all of the sin and all of the unbelief out of us an away from us Lord Lord there's a stream Lord that we can go to for healing Lord Lord whatever we have need overall we can go to that or we know that it's a finished work of calorie Lord it's already been paid for Lord we can just go there and draw from it whatever we have need of and farther tonight there's many that have needs and Lord in many hands that have been raised signifying the needs or if we just pray that you'll be with them touch each one touch the direct family tonight Lord Jesus Lord just manifest your healing to them and Lord we just pray that you'll just move on the scene Lord that they can be able to sell their house and Lord Lord for these ones that I've mentioned tonight Lord Jesus Lord that need a touch from you Lord we just commit them to you and just believe that you'll move on the scene and do what needs to be done in those situations Lord for the ones that sometimes we forget Lord the ones that are watching in on the internet or Jesus oh I just pray that you be with them all so hard Lord wherever they may be or whatever the situation is Lord you just be with them and touch them Lord just lead us and guide us tonight give us words give us understanding Lord oh Lord that just not be a service where we gather in Lohr but Lord just give us something or from your table and or just get me out of the way Lord and now that I can just be a vessel Lord worthy to say these things we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen Luke chapter 5 beginning of verse 1 it says and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake gun ENS surrett and saw two ships standing by the lake and by the fishermen were going out of them but the fishermen were going out of them and we're washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship and when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught and Simon answering said unto Him master we have told all the night and we have taken nothing nevertheless at that word I will let down the net and when they had this had this done they closed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckoned under their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink when Simon Peter saw it he fell down on his fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man O Lord for he was astonished and all that with him at the draw to the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsake all and followed him a man God bless you tonight and be seated so this little thought at the word you know brother brems preach preach the number of messages on at thy word and at thy word Lord and you know it's a interesting thought when you look at the when you look at the life of Peter see what what kind of person he was and if they bring up quote number one this is from serves we would see Jesus and brother brems says here comes Peter up his name is Simon here a big old burly lookin fisherman some greasy Fischer fishing apron owning come down sit down there on the on the side of the other side of the log or something listened at him preach when he come up to Jesus he said Pete your name is Simon your father is Jonas how'd he know that your name is Simon your father's name is Jonas but I'm gonna give you another name call you a little stone from now on Peter I can imagine Peter say well Lord Here I am and then the next quote is from here ye him and brother branham talking also about Peter and he says and here God was going to do something great because he was bringing forth Peter James and John and he said I'd call it hope faith and charity the three great gifts of God say take Peter for faith and James for hope and John has always loved which is charity and he takes faith hope and charity with him and he goes up to the mountain because he's fixing to do something he's going to make an expression and he wants it to be confirmed and he always confirms it with three witnesses two or three witnesses that was an Old Testament statement two or three witnesses let every word be established and the third and the third quote is from faith cometh by hearing and everybody I'm sure everybody's knows he says faiths burly as I once said faith has hair on its chest when it stands up and pulls out its big muscles out everything else vanishes away just take flies away when faith really takes a hold nothing else stands you know it's the way you know brother Bram said that Peter was a great big burly man ball headed fisherman in a big big burly man and he said that Peter was a type of faith you know if you look at his if you look at Peters life that's the life of faith and you know when you when you look at Peters life because you know lots of times people we look at the things that Peter done and you know Peter had faults and failures just like all of us but you know what Peter done some great things in his life Peter was given the keys of the kingdom God called him to him to to do a great work and you know there's there's a lot of things and he said you know faith is burly you know always say well every time always read that always think of Pete you know brother branham's describing Peter that way of being a burly guy and having faith you know having hair on his chest and having muscles you know that's the way we ought to have you know not looking at the circumstances but looking at what God said and you know brother Graham said many times he he said you know the right mental attitude to any divine promise of God will bring it to pass and that's the main thing is to have the right mental attitude you know we can we can look back through Peters life and you know later on we'll read some more quotes but you don't if you go back and you look at you know we know that from Peters life Peter was taught the Word of God you know he was able is ignorant and learned but you know what he always knew the word had always been taught the word and you know here here comes Jesus you know to speak to him and you know you know hit they had had fished all night and note no doubt he was very tired that day and you know here you are you you go through all these things you've worked all night and you've told brother Ram said you how hearten disheartening it is when you when you fish all night you don't catch anything and you know brother branham brother Bram said the one thing that that Peter knew was efficient he might not have known anything else couldn't write his own name but he knew how to fish he knew the water he knew the moon all the things that took place to be a fisherman he knew what but you know what Jesus came by one day and told him you know he said I want you Wendy to get in the ship and was preaching to the people and no doubt he knew the situation that Peter had been in but you know he told him it he said launch out into the deep once you launch out and you know the same thing is to us you know what there's the deep things of God the Bible says for us to search the deep things of God and it's and it's placed there and a lot of people think that they know you know many times we let our we let the situations that were in you brother Graham said you know we don't we can let our conditions get in our way and here they here they are and you know he says what will Schloss won't send it out into the deep and he says then why don't you cast your nets into the water you know that was a that's a very striking thing that for a man that's already fished all night he smokes know how to fish that's all he's ever done this fish he spits those waters he knows what he's doing but you know there was something about Jesus now did you know Peter had heard that about the Messiah but this is the first time that he came face to face with the Word made flesh and you know he was in this boat and he said you know I've heard all these things about this man but you know this was an hit hurting preach but this was this first interaction this was the first time they had an interaction with him and you know he went out there and you know he said he said Lord we fished all night and we ain't got nothing we've been down this road I know what I'm doing and it you know we see all this and he says but you know what he said nevertheless of all the things that I've seen and all my experiences and all that I've been through because you said that I'm gonna take you at your word I'm gonna take you at your word and I'm gonna throw this net in that I've done up ten times already but I'm gonna throw it in one more time which is the thing is is it's we can do things and you know like brother Dale was saying you know you can sit and you can pray and you can pray and you can pray and you never get anywhere and it just becomes a repetition or you sit and you read a book or you read the Bible to your eyes cross you read stuff you listen to something you don't even know what you're listening to you get zoned out on it but in all in the midst of all of that God will come and speak to you how many times have you been listening to something and you're not even really listening and something will catch your attention and you look like what but you hear he was coming to see Jesus the first here's Peter pulling those nets in and here they are trying to pull though all those fishing in it see he had heard all about Jesus but when he come face-to-face with him then he said Lord the part from me he said because I'm a sinful man he said I can't be in your presence he had a life-changing experience just by that one miracle you know many times people have seen many things take place in their lives but you know have we come to a place where it where it's been a life-changing experience as it changed has it changed your life because many people any people have seen many things but did it change your life you know many people say I've had a I got a revelation from God I got a revelation from God let me tell you something you ever get a revelation from God it's a life-changing experience that's it changes your life you because you know when brother Brendan wouldn't be on the curtain of time you know he come back and he said I can never be the same brother branham again one because it changed his whole outlook on life when he went to when he went beyond and seen the depths of hell when he went beyond and seen this in the fifth dimension and saw those things and came back you know it changed his life because he said don't ever go there you know it changed because he said nobody should go there he said you know it was his determination to make sure nobody had to go there but he said he said you know when you when you look beyond the curtain of time he said you can't describe it he said you can't put into words he said you can't think how great it is how sublime he said the words don't eat you he said there wasn't even words in the in the human vocabulary to explain how great it is and that's the way it is if you have a life-changing experience you know what it changes it changes everything about you you can't be the same person and that's what that's what we need to have is a life-changing experience you know we go back and look at you know Peter he had he had a lot of ups and downs in his lives he had some great great moments and you know all you look at all the thing every time Jesus done many great miracles and great things you know Peter was there you know Peter was there you know a lot of the different miracles took place when he preached the Sermon on the Mount you know all these different things Peters they are seeing all these things and you know he had a head of faith that he that he believed what Jesus said even even when Jesus told him of what he was what what he would do he didn't you know hey no no I believe this I got faith I believe you I got you back they said no he said listen you'll deny me even and all the things that but you know Peter had it had a faith and he believed and he walked in it and you know the same thing with you and I we need to have a faith have a revelation of God having experience brother Branham says this is a as I was saying earlier this is from taking God at His Word he said no no Peter was just not an ordinary fellow fished one or two nights he note all the signs of fishing just how the moon's supposed to be just how the waters are and they'd fished all night long and take enough and now just think here it is I want you to get it see they fished all night and taken nothing yeah Jesus told them to go straight back to where they'd be fishing and drop the net and they'd get a whole draw to fish now if they had just fished through that water an hour before hour after hour all night long and that take and had not taken even one fish how in the world are you going to drop the net down and get a whole bunch of fishes they're just not running it just looks don't even look reasonable sensible the Peter said to him here's what is Lord we've seen all night and taken nothing nevertheless that's the word I'm going to let that net down the net there you are is taking God at His Word not what you feel or taste or what this says or that says it's taking God at his word by word Lord I'm going to let down the net I don't know how you're going to be there but if you if there wasn't any there and Peter let down the net with faith believing that God would fulfill his word faith will put some there and it did do it it did do it fish was there so it's better it's by your faith you know brother Brown said that if if God was here you know if you have a need the the needs already been supplied it's already been met you know if he said if he was standing here tonight and you needed if you needed healing he said he couldn't do it they said it's already been fulfilled he said it's already there for you they said but you have to accept it that it's for you you know when when he was talking about the when faith and hope and charity you know brother I'm said talking about hope you know hope believes that something's going to take place but it looks in the season a long range you know it'll take place it'll take place he said faiths not that way he said faith already sees it he not looking off you know God will God will heal me but I'm looking for it in the in the future I know it's going to take place but he said if you got faith you already know you're healed it's I'm healed I'm not waiting for something take place I'm healed and that's how we know now we know that it's a finished work and then we can believe that that's been done but you know we have to take the things that we don't look at our own situations or our problems but we look at God's Word you know it's just like when you're looking and Peter's life you know and you know you get sometimes you get caught up and things just like you know he was walking along one day and there was a big crowd of people around Jesus and they're pushing on Jesus and you know brother Graham said you know he's trying to get people to back up so Jesus could get through the multitude and and you know and and you know and in the midst of all this you we don't see the things that are taking place because you know we just get in our own little world and here goes Peter walking down through there and and you know and you know there's crowds of people all around Jesus crowding him and you know Jesus said who touched me well you know Peter's the one that turn around said Lord everybody's touching you what you mean who touched you the question is who didn't touch you who didn't touch you but you know Jesus said there was a special kind of touch he said because I've seen I perceive virtues left from me you know sometimes we get in our own little worlds like you know we don't see the things that are taking place but you know there it was that that Peter was walking in and you know that woman she had faith to believe you know all she had to do was touch the hem of His garment that she could get what she needed and you know you know brother Graham said that you know she had to press through the crowd to get what she wanted she had to get there you know there was something that she had to do you know she hadn't you know wasted there you know used up everything that she had not gotten any better she had went through everything but she had come to the one that could give it to her and she pressed through that crowd and I'm sure there was a lot of people in that crowd didn't even see her she was not even that stood out to anybody but she had a need and when she pressed through you know Jesus was the one that identified her you know because he knew that she had had faith to believe what she to get what she needed you know he was the one identified her and told her she was made whole because of her faith and you know it's not that you know it has to be some some great things but you know brother Brown said you know we just need to have childlike faith just a childlike trust if we can just have that kind of faith you know you know you know I've worked I've worked in in maintenance and done you know this kind of worked for you know several years and you know when when Levi was little you know Levon he always told everybody that he's a fixer and he didn't it didn't matter what it was I could weld plastic or you know I mean whatever it didn't matter I mean I can I move mountains cuz I'm a fixer and he just brought anything to me and he just was like well honey that's broke and so was alright daddy will fix it they didn't he didn't matter what it was he think he could turn back time and do whatever you know well because he had he had confidence in right now whatever whatever it was I was a fixer and I could fix it just give it to Daddy you know Adam s way you know he was the same way you know they look at you and they and they see that they you know it's really it's a job but you're late they think they think it's you know almost like superpowers yeah I mean they look at you know the things that you can do they just think that's just I mean you know when you when you mess with things that are electrical and things like that new things don't work and all of a sudden you can make them happen I mean they just think that's just rocket science you know and you know and they say well we'll just give it to daddy daddy I'll take care of it but you know you know if we can have that same kind of confidence you know you know brother Brown was talking about you know God came out and you know he step that'll nothing he stepped out on his own word and began to speak his own word and he said he believed his own word he spoke it and he believed it and it come to pass he said what's your standing on he said you know that everything that here he said the earth was materialized because of his word he said your body was materialized because of his word all of the planets all of the things that we see you know read I was talking about he said you look in the in the the sky and see a hundred and twenty million years of light space and he said he created all of it and he said it all in order and all of it works just exactly the way he called it to he said it in order and you know they're still here you know looking back in history and can tell exactly when the stars moved when they lined up and they can go into the history I mean into the future and tell you when things are going to line up and when things are going to happen why because it's so perfect and the way it's set up and you know what he was the one that spoke all of that and he spoke your body but you know what not only did he speak that he also spoke to your life and he also spoke eternal life and if he spoke that then you know what he he's mindful of you he does there's nothing that's going to take him by surprise there's there's nothing that's going to stop him and yet again sometimes you know we get we get in a mindset that we wonder if God knows where we're at you know because the devil likes to talk to you and tries to put you someplace else where you're not but you know it's just like when when the disciples and then we're on to own the ship and you know Jesus had left and they had they had got on this ship and was out on the only sea by themselves you know that here they are you know they're out there floating in a storm all by themselves and you know what they don't have anybody but you know what Jesus knew exactly where they were he knew their exact condition and you know he didn't well he didn't know wait till it just started the wind started blowing and the water started getting a little choppy yeah he didn't come with the water just when it just started raining you know the Bible says you know it was a violent storm that came upon them to the place that it almost sunk the ship and here comes Jesus walking on the water you know they almost give up hope but you know what Jesus knew exactly where they were he knew exactly when to come wait he's just right on time in the midst of all this stormy sea and you know they were scared when they seen somebody coming on the water but you know he spoke to him and said peace be still you know don't be afraid that's me and you know Peter said Lord if that's you then let me walk on the water let me then bid me to come to you that's it that's it doesn't matter that's a man with faith let me tell you what we were we were in oh we were on a cruise ship I don't know how many people's been on a cruise ship but you know we're in the middle the ocean you can't find any land anywhere around you and they tell you that the bottom of the ocean where you're at so ver two miles deep it's a lot of water let me tell you what I didn't have no faith to walk on the water but you know I said I'll turn I looked at in all that distance and all that water looking out through there and I was like you know Peter have faith to believe he could walk on there and you know Jesus told him to come come on and walk on the water and he did walk on the water as long as he had faith you know as long as he he kept his eyes on Jesus he could do that he could do a miracle and sometimes sometimes we look at our lives and you know sometimes we go back and we think you know we've seen God moving our lives you know I still tell people at work you know I got I got a job God gave me a job and I got and I got over a lot of other people I ain't the smartest I ain't the most experienced ain't the best-looking is that tolling when are you going you're gonna agree to no but you know I love all those things but you know what God opened the doors for me you know when when there were so many other people that that could have got those jobs and people are saying you know I'm being hurtful I turned it I turned in my resume just like everybody else did I talked to people just like just like everybody else did but you know what I was the only one they got called and they told me go take them you know another people's taking the test everything I took it but you know I was the one in one week from the time I took I turned everything in took the test in one week had an interview in the same week and got a job all in a period of five days you know we got we got people you know they turn in resumes months weeks sometimes it takes a long time for people to get around anybody ever worked in a business knows human resources ain't the fastest group of people but you know I I tell people you know he took me one week they had my resume and went and talked to him to test interview had a job on one week in a five-day period I said people always say it's not what you know it's who you know I tell them I said I know I know though I know the one I know the one person that you need to know there's only one person that you need to know you know I've had jobs where we've tried to we've tried to find equipment and everybody else has looked for them looked high and low looked all through places and you know I've stood in the doorway enough and I've prayed to God and I said God we need you know we need to find this and you're the only one that knows where it's at and and something just comes to me and comes right in my mind and tells me exactly where to go and I walk right there and people have walked and looked at all over the place right over the top of it and won't write up to it and there it be I've been I've been on jobs where we've tried to figure stuff out and nobody seems to be able to figure out where all scratching our head ready to pull her hair out what if you got any hair to pull out but you know what pray to God and he'd come on the scene and give you the answer even and people say well you know it's just minor things listen gods gods in the end the big things gods in the little things you know I tell people everybody asked me how long arms doing I tell them I'm it's doing great you know I tell people that work I don't know why I broke my arm but you know what the Bible says that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord I don't know why but you know what it works out for my good hey you know what you know you know sure I wish I had too broke it but you know what in the end I know it works out I don't know what what a benefits for me but you know what I know God has it all in control but you're not witness to people all the time about my arm and you know I still I still tell people and I still have the thought and I'm still I still believe you know people ask me I'll look if you look at my arms they're not exactly straight but you know I still have that thought one these days I'm gonna arms like this right here and ones going to be straight as the other you know I'm still you know I still don't have the strength and this one that I had before but you know what I still believe I'm going to have the strength in this one why because God just don't start something and he just doesn't finish it I still believe that there's the healing power of God I'm still waiting for it to be manifested but you know what I wake up every day because you know what it when you can't move your arm when you can't use it when you get something thank God I can use my arm you know we we can be thankful because you know sometimes you know what we get in our own little will you get on it just how about me but you you're getting your own little world sometimes as the devil talks to you and boy you just you just get sit down and you know you just it just oh you just just this great big tormal of things and you know what it's when that's when God can come by and speak to you and tell you and show you things you know if you just sit down and look look think and look back to what God's done for you where God's brought you to you know if God didn't ever do anything else to make you know I I can't praise Him enough for what he's already done for me I can't praise Him enough for what he's already done for me well because he didn't have to do what he's already done but you know I thank God for that that His grace has been bestowed upon me that I've reached and received what I've received I wish you know you know so many people that you meet that you know they just don't have you know even though you know you have so many great things in their lives and everything can be going well but you know what they can't fight they can't find anything to be happy about they can't find anything that's worth looking and and you know and having been happy about our funny thing that's going right in their life and you know there's some people you know that their everything is going wrong and they don't look like they have anything and their life that's going right for me you know what they're the happiest people in the world you know Brennan says you know there's some people you know they said you just can't stand to be around they said you know they're so negative and they're so down in the mouth and everything like that he said you never wait he said there might be nice people he said but you don't want to be around them but you know he said there's people that you just love to be around yeah why because there's just something about them that draws you to one you know there's people that you know that if you have the right mental attitude if you have the right things in your life and you see God working in your life and you can just thank God and walk in that and see what God's done and know that God's going to do it you know if even if you just look back you know if you look and see what God has done and what God's going to do if he's done one thing in the past he'll do something he'll do what he's promised that he'll do you know there's many people that you know that they don't see what God has done they don't see what God has for them you know in the in the scripture we look back and you know you see the the two that we're going to Emmaus you know here here these here these are you know they Cleo person is in his friends you know they have walk with Jesus they knew about Jesus ministry they knew all these things and you know the other thing that they knew that Jesus had said he said you know tear this temple down in three days I'll rise I'll raise it up again he said you know he said that you know the Son of man will fall in the sinful hands then he said you know this is the type of death that our that I'll have to die but you he's you know he told him all these things but you know he said I'm gonna raise again he said one because he said the scripture spoke of me that this is going to take place but you know brother Branham said you know he said the disciples were sad because when they saw that Jesus had been crucified and died and was buried you know that's where they had their faith that's all that they had in their mind on was what had taken place and they could just see a tomb they could see it too but they couldn't see the resurrection even after all that Jesus had done raised raised the dead and and healed the sick and and fed and fed the multitudes all the things that he had done all the things that he had done and they sing that tune you know Peter Peter decided that he was going to go back fishing he went right back to where Jesus druing from but you know here comes here comes Cleophus and his friend and they're just walking along your brother I said they would just said I'm a walk I won't do like everybody else brother Dale wait brother weeks I like to walk down the aisle son but you know they're all sad I think you know they had to they were so sad they had to look up to see bottom and when Jesus stepped out to talk to him they were so sad are you a stranger don't you know what's been going on no if I was if that's if I if if that's not a pitiful testimony yeah we knew Jesus and he was he was wonderful he was powerful we thought we thought he'd fulfill the scripture man we singing him do great things all these things that Jesus said but jesus said I'm the resurrection and the life but I don't remember any of that I'm just looking at this tomb over here and I'm going back just going back to Emmaus and Jesus tries to talk to him you know they got such a pitiful testimony now they talk about all the things that he had done in the past and they even said and this is the third day well you know what he had done all these miracles in the past and he prophesied of what was going to take place and he said on the third day I'm gonna rise out of this but you know what they didn't remember know that no they just said and they just looked at a tomb a sealed tomb and that's all I saw their testimony was but you know what Jesus came in their midst and you know they were talking about Jesus and he walked into their myths but you know what they didn't see the president they gospel they didn't see the present day ministry standing there and he said old old fools and slow of hearts well here's what here's the scripture and you know and then he began at Moses and he began to expound the scriptures while he was standing there the Word made flesh was standing in front of them and he was trying to expound it to him and they were still blinded by it hey brother Branham said it's the same way today he said why they don't see the message they don't see the word and here he is in the present day and give a the people don't see it and here he is trying to expound - and he took him all day all day he he ministered to him didn't see anything but you know what when it came evening time you know he decided you know act like he was gonna go on you know they wanted him to stay so he stayed you know they saw something take place and the breaking of the bread at evening time then then they saw who was in their meats and he walked you know then he disappear for them but they were able to and they said did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way but they did not see what was taking place and it's the same way today people don't see what's taking place and you know Peter went back and was fishing went back to go fishing and you know the he was all sad and you know all lonely and blue all the things that he had went through but you you know Jesus was when he rose from the dead and he told Mary you know he told him said tell my disciples and Peter said I'll see you in and Galilee this is John chapter 21 and verse 1 said after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and on the Y's showed he himself there were together Simon Peter and Thomas called didymus and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciple Simon Peter said unto he unto them I go a-fishing they said unto Him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship it immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus said unto them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said under the cast the net on the right side of the ship and he shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fish is therefore that disciple whom Jesus loves saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard this the Lord he Girt his Fisher's coat on him for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubics driving dragging the nets with fishes and as soon as then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid their own and bread and jesus said unto them bring of the fish which you have now called Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fish is one hundred and fifty and three and all for all there were so many yet was the net not the net broken jesus said unto them coming down and none of the disciples Durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the Lord then said then Jesus then cometh and taketh bread and give them and fish likewise this is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead and that's what's so amazing is this was the third time that Peter is seeing Jesus raised from the dead and when they had dined jesus said unto Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto Him yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee he saith unto Him feed my lambs he saith to him again the second time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me he saith unto Him yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee he saith unto Him feed my sheep he saith unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto Him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee jesus said unto Him feed my sheep you know the first time when they went out to catch fish Peter told the Lord said Lord we fished all night we caught nothing but you know the second time he didn't do that the second time when Jesus told him to cast the net they just threw the Nets out but you know he went back to doing what God called him from but you know Jesus said there and said Peter do you love me you know Peter thought he was a failure he denied the Lord and although and you know and you know that's the reason in the scripture you know it says tell the disciples and Peter because Jesus wanted Peter to know he was loved right and you know even even in our faults and failures even we don't think God will bring to take us back but you know what God takes us back but you know he stood there he said Peter do you love me they said Lord I love you he said feed my sheep feed my sheep why because Jesus wanted Peter to know he said he said you know Satan has desired to sift you and all these things but you know he said after you're converted strengthen the Brethren but you know Hegel's want Peter to know Peter you have a ministry there's something for you to do don't let your past failures hold you back whatever it is don't sit there and say well Lord I fished all night and I haven't called anything though that net in Lord I don't know if you'll meet my needs throw your net in whatever it is that you're looking for throw your net in whatever it is one because Jesus wants to speak to each one of us the same way he has a word for each one of us you know what not over one of us can preach or or do whatever not everybody is singers not everybody's a musician or whatever it is but you know what God has a job for you job God called you and and he has something special for getting made you special for a reason maybe you know some people say well I can't do a lot I've heard people say I can't do a lot but I can pray let me tell you what that is a big job if you can pray that's a big job let me tell you what there's a there's a there was a time that there was people called prayer warriors I don't know if there's anybody like that anymore or not but you know what that's something that needed to be taken that really that really is a need whatever it is that you can do you can be alike to so many people you know we we think we can't be used of God you know the devil will beat us up and you know make you feel like you're lower than anything and but you know what people you know what people have needs they know who to come to people people may disagree with you people may not like you people may not like what you believe people may make fun of what you believe but you know what there's people when they have needs they know who to come to for prayer so whatever you have need of you you just be what God wants you to be and don't worry about what everybody else is doing and what everybody else has been called to do because you know at the end of at the end of the journey you know what God's not going to ask you God doesn't compare us to anybody else he wants to know if we're faithful to what he called us to do that's all I saw he's looking for is us to be faithful to what our job is and if we can do that then we can be blessed that's all I want to be I just want to be used of God in the and and and whatever little way that I can that I can be used but if you have if you have a need you know what there's a vast ocean out there you know brother Graham talked about that little fish no let's stand and musicians come but you know brother Brennan was talking about that little fish swimming around in the ocean saying I may have to drink sparingly you know I don't know when this is going to run out and sometimes we feel you know we can be the same way but less if you ever need to ask abundant you know they tell that little story about the minute you know you know he just he didn't he just he was just barely getting by just getting just a little bit and and this up man he was doing he was being prosperous he was doing he was doing better you know who's another man you know the first man he was a little bit jealous of the second man it's like well you know what because I have faith in that that's what I'm asking God for you know some people just pray just to supply my needs but you know what there's there's more that you can ask of God and the problem but the problem is is people want to be millionaires but you know what I believe God wants us to live comfortably you don't have to you don't have to live hand-to-mouth but I believe God has has a blessings for us and it's but it's not just material blessings but those are blessings that God has for us but you know what God I believe God wants us to be blessed in every area of our life whatever you have need of God will bless you in it so god bless you tonight amen [Music] just blood and righteousness I dare not trust the sweetest frame but wholly know Jesus name on
