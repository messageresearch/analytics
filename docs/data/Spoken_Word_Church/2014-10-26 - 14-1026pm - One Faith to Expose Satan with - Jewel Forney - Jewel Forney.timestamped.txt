[0:09] my procedure I had done what three weeks
[0:11] ago

[0:17] in
[0:18] recovery and uh this guy he comes he
[0:21] pulls the curtain back introduces
[0:24] himself of course I don't remember his
[0:26] name and he starts telling
[0:28] me the possible options that I have
[0:33] putting stance in you know I'm like okay
[0:38] you know like brother Tom said got to go
[0:40] along with a
[0:44] program but uh anyway I'm laying there
[0:47] and uh after what I've been through to
[0:50] lay still 4 hours without moving is a
[0:53] very very hard thing to do and uh anyway
[0:58] I'm laying there and my son Jacob he
[1:00] went with me and he's sitting out there
[1:02] with me and we talking and 4 hours a
[1:05] long time to think you know you laying
[1:07] still well you got a lot to think about
[1:10] anyway yeah and uh laying still is
[1:13] harder than the procedure itself I'm
[1:16] laying there thinking well you know
[1:17] after everything this man has told
[1:20] me that's not what I asked for right
[1:24] that's not what I ask you to
[1:26] ask well I get home I tell Jo
[1:31] she said well okay they'll let us know
[1:33] so uh usually when there's something
[1:36] wrong they're going to call you and let
[1:37] you know all this is what we got to do
[1:39] when we got to do it right right and uh
[1:42] well about a week passed well first of
[1:44] all brother Dale call me how everything
[1:46] go well we didn't get what we
[1:49] necessarily asked for what does he say
[1:52] Keep On
[1:53] Believing every time what It Go Keep On
[1:56] Believing let's believe and he knows me
[2:00] I'm going to believe amen so Brother
[2:04] Dean calls I tell
[2:07] him uh basically the first thing comes
[2:09] out of his mouth is that lion stinking
[2:14] devil that is
[2:16] not that is not what we prayed about I
[2:18] said amen we didn't right so uh anyway
[2:22] Jo when she starts investigating she
[2:25] goes all
[2:27] out so she calls these people hey it's
[2:30] been a week why Haven we heard from
[2:33] you well we nothing really nothing to
[2:35] say we're going to mail you copy the
[2:37] report but he was
[2:40] told well she's told what his nurse
[2:43] Karen talk to Danny trust me this guy
[2:47] didn't look like no caring that come in
[2:49] and talk to

[2:53] anyway
[2:56] uh she tells me well Karen told you no
[2:58] Karen didn't are you sure yeah back and
[3:00] forth with that no she did not this guy
[3:02] pulled the curtain open tells me what we
[3:04] got to do are my options and is it hard
[3:06] to get off work and no well all right
[3:09] that's good well then we'll get in touch
[3:11] with you well nobody's got in touch with
[3:12] me until she gets in touch with them and
[3:16] they tell
[3:18] her doctor says it cannot get any better
[3:21] than what
[3:22] they what they
[3:28] plan
[3:30] so she called him back to let them know
[3:32] that Karen did not talk to

[38:50] Bibles to the book of Ephesians the
[38:52] fourth
[38:55] chapter
[38:57] you already got it up
[39:00] there and I'm going to read from it
[39:02] right there cuz it's a lot easier on my
[39:04] eyes one thing about when you get one
[39:07] thing about this is this will work real
[39:10] good yeah
[39:14] 53 man I tell you what I'm trying to
[39:16] keep them out to I got glasses I quit
[39:19] wearing them I said more wear them the
[39:21] more my eyes dependent on it so I said
[39:23] I'm going to quit wearing them because
[39:24] when I get old I want to be wearing them
[39:25] that thick
[39:30] yeah I better quit now cuz every time I
[39:33] went to the doctor they say you need to
[39:34] add a little more I said by the time I
[39:36] get 55 or 60 they're going to be like
[39:38] this I said no way I says I just stop it
[39:42] says he said there is one
[39:45] body and one Spirit right so if any
[39:49] Revelation produces more than one spirit
[39:51] is the wrong Revelation one Spirit even
[39:55] as ye are called in one ho of your
[39:59] calling one
[40:01] Lord I don't know where the two Lord
[40:04] idea come up from one Lord One Faith one
[40:09] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[40:16] above all and through all and in you all
[40:22] that got to answer the question amen
[40:25] next uh the N
[40:28] Philippians third
[40:30] chapter and it use this it says here
[40:34] Philippians 3 3rd Chapter verse three we
[40:38] are the circumcision which worship God
[40:41] in the
[40:42] spirit so we know it ain't but one
[40:44] Spirit right one God right and rejoice
[40:48] in Christ Jesus and have no
[40:52] confidence in the flesh that's B
[40:57] oh Father I trust you right now Lord
[41:00] help me one more time to yeld my body my
[41:02] mind my spirit my soul to you God father
[41:06] I trust God right now you give us
[41:07] strength to finish this service father
[41:10] now father I commit myself to you in the
[41:12] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[41:15] God bless you may be seated one
[41:19] moment thank the Lord for the reading of
[41:21] the word of God this evening one Lord
[41:24] One Faith one baptism that's in you all
[41:28] that's with you all and through you all
[41:31] hallu I went to the scripture I'm going
[41:32] to take a title on One Faith to expose
[41:37] Satan with right in other way if you got
[41:40] a revelation and if you ain't if it
[41:42] ain't exposing Satan you got a wrong
[41:45] Revelation cuz Revelation was given to
[41:47] the bride to bring a power over the
[41:50] devil how to expose Satan and everyone
[41:53] his
[41:55] techniques so that what we want to talk
[41:57] about one Faith to expose the devil with
[41:59] and I begin to realize as I talking them
[42:01] thing because I begin to realize it take
[42:03] real Revelation to fight against the
[42:06] power of Darkness how we all try we all
[42:09] we talk about faith and I thought people
[42:11] talk about faith but when it come down
[42:13] to facing the devil with it they throw
[42:15] up their hand and surrender how they
[42:17] begin to say I'm not able to do this I
[42:19] cannot I can not uh it's too much for me
[42:23] to H but that I want you to ask your
[42:25] question how long did it take you to
[42:27] find out it was too much for you to H
[42:30] that why you had to depend on God how if
[42:33] he know that you can H it you wouldn't
[42:35] need to depend on him so we begin to
[42:37] look at these things and we begin to
[42:39] look at it so God we want to talk about
[42:41] faith now we realize the prophet taught
[42:44] levels of Faith right y when of you I'm
[42:47] going to read a quote out the out the
[42:49] Blasphemous name and he begin to talk
[42:52] about I think page 22 right now 23 it
[42:55] says then he begin to talk on
[42:57] blaspheming and he begin to talk about
[42:58] faith he said the and the biggest part
[43:02] of our faith is mental Faith mental
[43:05] faith faith that brought you here today
[43:07] that you got up this morning you was
[43:09] able to go and sit down at the table eat
[43:11] your food you didn't think about it you
[43:13] was able to get in your car and drive it
[43:15] to church you didn't think about it in
[43:17] other words you know you know we we got
[43:19] mental faith and he says
[43:22] here is this my water y thanks there
[43:26] this
[43:29] morning it wouldn't mou somebody drunk
[43:31] out of it no I
[43:33] wasn't I done been there and done that I
[43:36] told him I said we was one time I was in
[43:38] a country I said I was in Uganda and I
[43:41] we it was it was six of us in the motel
[43:44] when I got up in the morning I noticed
[43:46] everybody coming out the bathroom they
[43:47] doing I said wonder why they about
[43:49] wiping their mouth but I was laying in
[43:51] the bed looking when I got up my
[43:53] toothbrush were
[43:55] dripping
[44:00] that ANW the question I shouldn't have
[44:03] told my wife about she wouldn't kiss me
[44:05] for a
[44:10] year that's the way it
[44:13] go it's the truth in way that's right
[44:16] but hey you know brother say we got to
[44:18] be so close we can chew each other chair
[44:20] and go I just want chew it
[44:25] first amen you know it just that way now
[44:28] you know I mean we we by God grace but
[44:31] we know that one Faith one body one
[44:33] bride Hallelujah so here we have he said
[44:36] the biggest part of our faith is mental
[44:38] Faith right you must have you must you
[44:42] must have this mental faith in other
[44:44] word order even to operate in the laws
[44:46] of this the law itself you must have
[44:50] this man of
[44:51] faithly then he goes and says hearing
[44:55] the word bring bring us to a mental
[44:57] reconciliation of God but if this this
[45:02] come from above oh brother if it scrats
[45:06] this
[45:07] heart and then there is is a Godly
[45:11] spiritual of faith our men of faith
[45:14] become a spiritual faith and up on the
[45:18] foundation or Revelation I will build my
[45:21] church right GL and when that screen of
[45:25] Grace is pulled into that mental faith
[45:28] that give you got then up on wait then
[45:32] you got them upon this a spiritual
[45:37] Revelation I will build my church in
[45:40] other words he begin to take it to the
[45:41] level he said up on this spiritual
[45:44] Revelation is what the devil going to be
[45:46] defeated at H and other words we going
[45:48] to begin to realize here this mental
[45:51] faith that we got we got to do one thing
[45:53] with it you said what can I do with my
[45:56] Al faith I tell you what you need to do
[45:57] with it if we can all get it to drop 18
[46:00] Ines if you could get if you can get
[46:03] yourself out the way just to get your
[46:05] mle faith to drop 18 inches it'll be a
[46:07] supernatural Faith so I get to look it
[46:10] up excuse
[46:14] me as I begin to look at this here I
[46:17] want to deal with well you know we we
[46:19] talk about mental faith we need to find
[46:21] it in the scripture how can
[46:23] we talk on mental faith Fai and not have
[46:27] scripture to produce M of faith hallu if
[46:29] there a ment of Faith there got to be a
[46:31] scripture to produce mental faith and
[46:33] there got to be scripture to produce
[46:34] Supernatural Faith so now I want to look
[46:37] at a mental faith in the book of in the
[46:41] book of First Corinthians 13 I want to
[46:43] look read the scripture 1 Corinthians 13
[46:45] verse
[46:46] 2 look at this fa Paul talking about
[46:49] real this is a powerful favor he can
[46:51] pull that First Corinthians 13th chapter
[46:53] verse
[46:54] 2
[46:57] if he can pull that up then I'll read
[46:58] that real quick but I want you to
[47:00] realize here that if we don't get to
[47:04] read it out the Bible Paul said it here
[47:07] he says and though I have the gift of
[47:11] Prophecy right
[47:14] and understand all Mysteries now a go
[47:18] right here now praise
[47:21] God he said pa me here that what ver I
[47:26] read verse two yeah verse two he said
[47:28] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[47:31] understand all mystery it's seen it
[47:34] though if we understand the mystery we
[47:36] got power over the devil that don't mean
[47:38] nothing to the devil that mean that you
[47:40] can read and grab for knowledge H that
[47:43] mean that I can come to the first six
[47:45] seal and not be born again Hallelujah
[47:49] understand all mry and all knowledge and
[47:52] though I have what all yeah yeah all
[47:56] faith that look good that all Faith you
[47:58] said if I got all Faith that's all I
[48:00] need he said do I have all Faith so that
[48:03] I can remove mountains and have not what
[48:08] I am nothing so he did P here all this
[48:13] right here is no good without charity
[48:16] and we know that Christ is Charity H and
[48:20] what so Paul let us understand without
[48:23] Christ I'm nothing that's right I don't
[48:26] care how much mle Faith you got you must
[48:28] be born again Hallelujah outside of
[48:31] being born again you have no power over
[48:34] the devil you have no power over
[48:36] circumstances you must have Supernatural
[48:39] Faith that's that's mental Faith he talk
[48:42] about let's just talk about let's just
[48:43] look at what Paul talk about
[48:45] supernatural Faith Galatians
[48:48] 2 and verse
[48:51] 20 the book of Galatians 2 and verse 20
[48:54] he find that for us real quick I'm going
[48:56] to use that one too because here's two
[48:58] levels of faith I'm dealing with Paul
[49:01] talking about mental Faith here I got it
[49:03] I can move mountains I got faith though
[49:05] I can understand Mysteries I can have
[49:08] all this and I'm nothing so Paul had to
[49:10] bring us to the Revelation here H this
[49:13] is another realm of Faith Paul talking
[49:15] about right here if you notice here Paul
[49:17] talk about another realm of Faith how
[49:19] that other faith I can move Mountain I
[49:21] can understand all the mystery
[49:23] Hallelujah I can have prophecy I got all
[49:26] knowledge and I'm nothing but Paul come
[49:29] to Galatians 2 chapter at verse 20 he
[49:32] said I am crucified with Christ
[49:35] nevertheless I live but then he goes and
[49:37] say no am minute I don't want to put i
[49:40] in it let me take myself out of him he
[49:42] said but not yet not I but Christ liveth
[49:46] in me that's what the power of Faith he
[49:49] said Christ live in me and the life
[49:52] which I now live in the what I live by
[49:56] the favor of w hallah by the favor of
[49:59] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[50:02] himself for me Paul said this life right
[50:04] here this fi right here it will move the
[50:06] devil HL not just a mental conception
[50:10] not just a ment of Faith but Ain life of
[50:12] God living on the inside of me that's
[50:14] the fa I'm talking about of faith when
[50:16] the devil see you walking the devil know
[50:18] who you are H you don't even have to
[50:21] pray all your Shadow got to do is get
[50:23] around it h demons know the life right H
[50:26] the demon don't
[50:28] care demon don't care how religious you
[50:30] are oh yeah he said Satan and the rising
[50:33] of the sun he said Satan okay I'll write
[50:35] you all your Doctrine he said but if you
[50:38] miss that life if you miss that life he
[50:41] know that you would not come up in way
[50:43] because it going to take one Spirit One
[50:46] Faith to raise you out of the grave and
[50:48] that same faith that rais Christ from
[50:50] the dead if it dwell in your mortal body
[50:53] it will bring you out of the grave all
[50:55] right the begin look here let's take
[50:58] your ball begin here so we talking about
[51:00] mental faith and other way we talking
[51:02] about Revelation Faith Supernatural
[51:04] faith and know where we trying to find
[51:06] out how to tap into this real how
[51:08] because really and know where Satan is
[51:10] there too many people to beat down and
[51:12] they begin to look here brother what can
[51:14] I do I'm trying to build my faith I'm
[51:16] trying to work more I'm trying to study
[51:18] more how I'm trying to get how did
[51:20] brother say you can study too much he
[51:23] said people have a nervous breakdown
[51:25] trying to study H what you need to do
[51:27] and say Lord help me to give true
[51:29] Revelation help me to get born again so
[51:32] I can see Christ in the scripture H
[51:35] study ain't going to give you the Holy
[51:36] Ghost HJ but if you ever get born again
[51:39] H then he'll make the scripture live
[51:41] through you H that's what we trying to
[51:42] do so we begin to go
[51:44] here we got to deal with this thing
[51:47] because see we want to expose demons and
[51:50] God give you Revelation to give you
[51:51] power over Devils that mean power of
[51:54] depression power over high blood
[51:56] pressure power over sugar diabetes I'm
[51:59] saying power over the gates of the hell
[52:01] the Gates of Hell may come against you
[52:03] he said but the gates of hell like that
[52:05] brother was testifying up he said the
[52:08] gates of hell was coming against you but
[52:10] the Gates of Hell shall not be able to
[52:12] overcome true Revelation H true
[52:15] Revelation by the devil Hallelujah and
[52:18] in word we need a power that we can
[52:20] overcome the devil cuz the devil fights
[52:23] too revelation is Supernatural right do
[52:27] you realize Revelation is a supernatural
[52:29] a supernatural experience with God
[52:31] divine revelation from God is
[52:33] Supernatural but also Satan demon of
[52:36] towers of Doubt is Supernatural
[52:38] Hallelujah so you f Faith one me but you
[52:41] got Supernatural Demons of Doubt right
[52:43] so every time Faith go out doubt attack
[52:45] you oh yeah H what to try to try your
[52:48] faith see when you hold to the promise
[52:50] because only thing that's Supernatural
[52:52] is God's word and God's word must be
[52:54] reflect in heaven and on Earth the same
[52:57] way right you can't have one Revelation
[53:00] that's not in heaven if you got
[53:02] Revelation on Earth it must be reflected
[53:04] in heaven how we told Peter he said
[53:06] Peter he said I know who the man said I
[53:09] am he was dealing with Revelation Faith
[53:11] but Peter had this Faith right here H
[53:14] Faith a true Revelation faith that God
[53:17] gave Peter and the Gates of Hell will
[53:20] not taken out of him right even though
[53:22] Peter you said Peter denied Jesus he
[53:24] should have
[53:25] right Peter couldn't have him deny Jesus
[53:29] you understand the man done what Jesus
[53:31] told me he going to do how before the
[53:33] conqu you going to deny me how he didn't
[53:36] deny him by self will he denied because
[53:38] j a prophesy he would deny if Peter
[53:40] wouldn't deny him what Jesus said
[53:42] something that he don't know the
[53:43] beginning from the end he knew that
[53:45] Peter would deny how why because Jesus
[53:48] had to go to Calvary by himself he had
[53:50] to die for the sins of the world it was
[53:52] not Jesus and Peter it was Jesus Christ
[53:54] himself
[53:55] self he knew that there but the point of
[53:58] it is but this Revelation Peter had he
[54:01] wanted Peter to understand he said this
[54:02] Revelation Peter he said your Revelation
[54:05] here he said the Gates of Hell going to
[54:07] fight against you and the Gates of Hell
[54:09] going to be against you Peter all the
[54:11] time but Peter but I want to let you
[54:12] know one but the gangs of Hell shall not
[54:15] be able H I don't care what power this
[54:18] devil you I don't care how much doubt he
[54:20] TR your mind that Gates of Hell shall
[54:22] not be able to overcome you Peter by
[54:25] faith in
[54:27] Revelation you see what I'm saying the
[54:29] Gates of Hell could separate Peter cuz
[54:31] when they was challenged with a spirit
[54:32] of Doubt right they were challenge a
[54:37] demon of Doubt walked in jesus' Ministry
[54:40] why Jesus was walking with his disciple
[54:42] a demon of Doubt was walking too hallah
[54:44] a demon of Doubt was fighting just as
[54:46] much as Faith was fighting so the
[54:48] disciples they as they walking here
[54:50] before Jesus here they was they see
[54:52] these miracles of Jesus they see all
[54:54] these things right here and this demon
[54:56] of Doubt standing there and the
[54:59] Pharisees saw these things why you think
[55:02] when Nicodemus come Nicodemus said we
[55:04] know right H it was not that the devil
[55:08] didn't know he said we know that th man
[55:10] come from God for no man can do these
[55:13] Miracle except God be with but Jesus
[55:15] said don't you worry about miracles you
[55:18] worry about the life of God on the
[55:19] inside of you he never said one thing
[55:21] about the first pull or the second P he
[55:24] went to the Third pull the word he said
[55:26] to them you must be born again I I don't
[55:29] care how many Miracle you see except you
[55:32] born again only way the devil can't
[55:34] Prevail over you it's by the new birth
[55:36] so we begin to deal with these things
[55:38] here so Peter didn't walk with now I
[55:40] want you to notice
[55:42] here St John 6 chapter let me start
[55:47] right the 64th verse down to the
[55:50] 6769 uh St
[55:52] John me look at it here real quick St
[55:55] John the 6th chapter here they was
[55:58] walking right here and this demon of
[56:00] Doubt was just as strong in the midst of
[56:02] Jesus as their faith was they walked
[56:05] with his word and they seen these Great
[56:07] Signs they seen these great signs and
[56:09] wonders and you thought that because the
[56:11] people see Great Signs and W I like
[56:13] something I talked to a while back I was
[56:16] up at the brother brother Ronny cobs
[56:20] Ronnie uh cops no Gary cops excuse me
[56:24] and he was up there that's Charlie cop's
[56:26] son and me and him was fellowshipping
[56:28] together and he was telling me about
[56:30] these Miracles he saw with brother
[56:33] Brandon he said remember brother said
[56:35] those little young boys were getting up
[56:36] giving their seats to the older people
[56:38] that he was one of them young boys he
[56:40] was at that time he was 11 to 12 years
[56:42] old he was sitting there and he said
[56:44] brother Brandon come on and the young
[56:45] guy would get up and let the elderly
[56:47] held their seats and they'll stand there
[56:48] but by them doing that it gave them the
[56:50] opportunity to come and sit down on the
[56:51] around the wall right at the front and
[56:53] brother Gary told me said brother he
[56:55] said you talking about miror he said I
[56:57] seen things I seen people get out of
[56:59] wheelchairs he said I'm setting there
[57:00] Whoa man they can't be but he said
[57:03] brother out of all the Miracles I saw
[57:05] and all the signs and wonders I saw sat
[57:07] there he did not give me a new birth
[57:10] right he I had to go out and find God
[57:12] for myself and be born again by the
[57:14] spirit those miracles did not do one it
[57:17] didn't keep it from drinking it didn't
[57:19] keep him from acting like the world he
[57:20] had to come to a revelation I need to
[57:23] have Christ on the inside of me not just
[57:25] walking with me but on the inside of
[57:28] me
[57:30] Hallelujah so he goes and says these
[57:33] days and these guys right here watch
[57:35] this demon and doubt to follow this
[57:37] ministry let me see Jesus speaking here
[57:40] let me start 63rd verse St John 6
[57:42] chapter 63rd
[57:44] verse he goes here because you remember
[57:46] I say have no confidence in the flesh so
[57:49] Jesus teaching them this in other words
[57:51] he trying to teach us the reason we
[57:53] can't get nothing from God cuz we we
[57:54] always think we helping it oh yeah if
[57:57] you can help God don't need your help he
[57:59] don't need you to try to help his
[58:01] promise he need you to get out of the
[58:02] way so he can do it promise how long
[58:04] your flesh in the way that was the
[58:05] hindering part how because we always
[58:07] feel like look what I done what you done
[58:09] got in the way H the soon the more you
[58:12] learn how to get out of the way the more
[58:14] you'll see God he said it is the spirit
[58:16] that Quicken the flesh propit what
[58:19] that's right that's
[58:22] right nothing from nothing what okay so
[58:27] we got that point there the flesh
[58:28] Prophet nothing but the words that I
[58:31] speak unto you they are
[58:34] what and what so power is in the word
[58:38] Not In the Flesh in the word the flesh
[58:41] ain't got nothing to do with it it's the
[58:43] word that's in control it's the power of
[58:45] faith in the word what move the devil
[58:48] then he goes and says here watch this
[58:51] demon of doubt that was following his
[58:52] Revival Jesus been the word he
[58:55] Discerning the spirit he see the dark
[58:57] clouds of Doubt over those guys so here
[58:59] he is he said there are some of you that
[59:02] believe not so there was another
[59:05] Supernatural presence in their midst
[59:07] there was another Supernatural move that
[59:09] was moving Fai was moving but also Satan
[59:12] was moving what was he doing he was
[59:13] creating doubt in their mind trying to
[59:16] create doubt in their faith how trying
[59:18] to make them walk away from the word and
[59:20] that what people do when the word come
[59:21] on the SE say come here they try to put
[59:24] doubt in How could a clow be there how
[59:26] can this happen it a I don't need to
[59:28] know how I need to believe that it
[59:30] happened exactly Glory yes sir
[59:34] Hallelujah and the Bible say and Jesus
[59:37] knew because the word always have power
[59:39] over the devil the devil's not pulling
[59:41] nothing over on Jesus Hallelujah he said
[59:44] and Jesus knew from the beginning what
[59:46] did from the beginning what beginning he
[59:48] knew from the attribute that Satan had
[59:50] in heaven he knew when he was on Earth
[59:52] he going to be doing the same thing
[59:54] putting doubt in him how he knew from
[59:56] the beginning who they were that believe
[59:58] not who shall betray him so Judas was
[1:00:00] not no mistress here he knew that the
[1:00:02] devil was walking in skin just like he
[1:00:03] was in

[1:00:29] himself in there you can't work your way
[1:00:31] in there you was already in there
[1:00:33] Hallelujah Jesus said and then he goes
[1:00:35] to here he said and then as he said
[1:00:37] these words look like that he was
[1:00:38] letting them know what was he doing he
[1:00:40] separating the she he he was separate
[1:00:43] the demon of Doubt with pulling those

[1:04:36] because the word of God so here go Peter
[1:04:38] he praying and he pray he using he
[1:04:40] blessing them because that is what
[1:04:42] Abraham do his his compy is to bless
[1:04:45] them how so he said we are we believe
[1:04:47] and we are sure but Jesus knew that all
[1:04:49] of he knew that it was a devil in the
[1:04:51] midst of it and Jes I said have not I
[1:04:54] chosen you 12
[1:04:56] y why he would not permit Peter to bless
[1:04:59] the devil right and God won't permit you
[1:05:02] to permit you to bless a devil cuz we
[1:05:04] didn't come to bless demon we come to
[1:05:05] cast them out how he would not permit
[1:05:08] Peter to put a blessing on Judah he had
[1:05:10] not I CH you one had not I chose you and
[1:05:12] one of you is a what devil a devil what
[1:05:15] he trying to tell you one of you is
[1:05:17] eternally separated from God right that
[1:05:21] what he was telling fa he know we go and
[1:05:23] we speak these in the Bible say he spoke
[1:05:25] of Judah is so he re not only did he
[1:05:27] call him a devil he revealed the name y
[1:05:30] right if you know not only did he called
[1:05:32] his name a devil he revealed who it was
[1:05:35] how did Judah he spoke up Judah is which
[1:05:37] was the mystery of Satan revealed how do

[1:05:41] bit more I'm not going to be here real
[1:05:42] long today God but I want you to just
[1:05:44] get a we just want to just hit on faith

[1:05:48] people today just trying to get Faith
[1:05:50] and trying to get it the wrong way right
[1:05:51] right people want to see something if I
[1:05:53] can see something I can believe it if
[1:05:54] you can see something you don't need
[1:05:56] faith faith is not based on what you see
[1:05:59] faith based on what you believe how you
[1:06:01] how you know going to be a Rapture
[1:06:03] because something on the inside of me
[1:06:05] got a pull from the other real I can't
[1:06:08] explain the Rapture but I know there
[1:06:10] going to be a Rapture I can tell you
[1:06:12] there's a power that could been
[1:06:14] translating us from one place to the
[1:06:16] next I don't know what call them things
[1:06:18] in the world to drop off I don't know
[1:06:20] what call my desire to change I can't

[1:06:26] that's a another Power pulling you
[1:06:29] didn't quit drinking and smoking and lay
[1:06:30] down drugs on your own but there was a
[1:06:32] power on the inside to the Rapture

[1:06:50] answer Lord how do I get this Faith to
[1:06:53] work how do I get to a demon see I'm
[1:06:57] let's see Faith was given to keep you
[1:07:01] not you keep it right God didn't give

[1:07:07] time we get you know everybody get a
[1:07:09] little little film grow over your eye at
[1:07:11] times but that faith that was put there
[1:07:14] is to keep you from getting your name
[1:07:16] scratched off how why the devil can't do
[1:07:18] God put a faith of Revelation in you
[1:07:20] that the devil can't move your name

[1:17:44] it's different being in a real with God
[1:17:46] and being in the human realm in the
[1:17:48] human realm you know I mean when a man
[1:17:51] when a man like SE when Samson had the
[1:17:54] anointing of God on him and got himself
[1:17:55] out the way God come down but that was
[1:17:58] in the when he got out of the way God
[1:18:00] come down and Ed the gift of Fai that he
[1:18:01] had in him but when s went that way he
[1:18:03] was just a man see that what people Miss
[1:18:06] brother Brandon they said well brother
[1:18:08] Brandon wasn't a man brother BR was a
[1:18:09] man and brother Brandon made opinions
[1:18:12] but that we that what we say brother say
[1:18:14] don't take the pin go back to what I'm
[1:18:16] saying in the word they asked brother
[1:18:18] Bron a question one time sister hum the

[1:18:25] brother said I believe that you know the
[1:18:26] way the thing going Martin Luther King
[1:18:28] would lead the people to a Slaughter and

[1:21:47] is though see what we take we build
[1:21:49] faith on the rim when everything is
[1:21:52] going good and that's the the majority
[1:21:55] of things that people do when they talk
[1:21:58] about faith they talk about you know the
[1:22:00] song talk about
[1:22:02] faith when you up on the mountain I wish
[1:22:06] I can keep that song on the mountain

[1:22:46] talk about Lord I I've been calling on
[1:22:49] your name and you're not healing me and
[1:22:51] this and that we get to start we get to
[1:22:53] frustrating and talking and get anything
[1:22:55] you know we thought well he ain't going
[1:22:56] to hear me well he can't hear you with
[1:22:58] that kind of attitude
[1:23:00] right but faith is yes Revelation faith
[1:23:04] is right is what the Hebrew boys had how

[1:23:16] is able and you got to know that he's
[1:23:18] able every day that we know that he's
[1:23:21] able but I want let you know something
[1:23:23] else if he don't deliver us that don't
[1:23:26] change God if he don't bring us out of
[1:23:29] the fire that don't change our God I
[1:23:32] live for God and I die for God if I had
[1:23:34] to die I'm holding on to my faith that's
[1:23:37] Revelation your faith if he deliver or

[1:23:48] I'm having a trial if he heal me or if
[1:23:51] he don't I know He's Able Hallelujah and
[1:23:54] I'm going to keep testifying and I'm
[1:23:56] going to keep giving God glory sometime
[1:23:58] we think people that not getting healed

[1:24:03] talking about that thing for 20 years
[1:24:05] and they heal Hallelujah I just give up
[1:24:08] that what your that's a wrong attitude

[1:25:52] we don't hold on a confession long
[1:25:54] enough musicians
[1:25:57] come I'm going to use this last quote as
[1:26:00] they
[1:26:02] come brother Brandon use simple
[1:26:05] things to bring out power to express
[1:26:09] Faith he uses nature to express Faith he
[1:26:15] talking about nature and resurrection
[1:26:17] and then he goes here he goes in this
[1:26:19] message right
[1:26:20] here the
[1:26:22] restoration of the brid
[1:26:25] tree and he used this little s simple
[1:26:28] thought right here as I close with this
[1:26:31] you say I need Faith what do I need to
[1:26:34] do you need to learn how to let go right
[1:26:38] you know sometime the Holy Ghost want to
[1:26:39] get on people they can't let go I feel
[1:26:41] it boy I Just sh you should just did it
[1:26:45] nobody Ain going to knock you down for
[1:26:46] shouting and praising God that's that be
[1:26:48] the last thing Brother Sam going to do
[1:26:49] how if it's genuine worship it'll be
[1:26:51] inine in order Hallelujah one thing
[1:26:53] about the Holy Ghost don't get out of
[1:26:55] order I've seen the sister shout the
[1:26:56] other week shouted the power God hit her
[1:26:59] she fell dead in the floor and a dress
[1:27:01] stayed in order that's the Holy Ghost I
[1:27:03] seen one sister shouting one down and
[1:27:05] the dress fell

[1:32:58] AR and such a way that he that he can
[1:33:02] and nothing in him to burst open he made
[1:33:06] that way he knows it y you and he can
[1:33:10] enforce that law to take him Plum to the
[1:33:13] Bottom of the Sea and raise him back up
[1:33:17] right again yeah amen we got a law yeah
