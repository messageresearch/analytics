[8:32] revelation 1 1-3 father we thank you for
[8:35] your love and the understanding of each
[8:37] and every one of us we thank you for you
[8:40] but we know if we gathered tonight
[8:41] that's one thing but for you to be in
[8:44] our midst is a wonderful opportunity
[8:46] the children of israel felt and believed
[8:48] that they were your children as they
[8:50] journeyed through life
[8:51] but the more that they began to realize
[8:53] that you was with them
[8:55] the better everything was so is it today
[8:58] and we pray that you would just bless
[9:00] and guide each one and keep us lord
[9:02] open our eyes that we may see forgive
[9:05] our sins
[9:06] cure us lord into your love
[9:09] and got each one in jesus name
[9:11] amen
[9:14] so we've been reading from revelations
[9:16] three i'm realizing one verse one
[9:19] through three
[9:20] on these services
[9:23] so the revelation of jesus christ which
[9:25] god gave unto him
[9:27] to show unto his servants things which
[9:29] must shortly come to pass
[9:31] and he said it signified it by his angel
[9:33] unto his servant john
[9:35] who by record of the word of god and the
[9:37] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[9:39] things that he saw
[9:40] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[9:42] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[9:45] those things which are written therein
[9:47] for the time
[9:49] is at hand and you may be seated
[9:51] surely if
[9:53] john could right back there the time is
[9:55] at hand here we are 2 000 years later
[9:58] surely we would comprehend more about
[10:01] that time being at hand all right
[10:04] now
[10:05] what has been our thought we've been
[10:06] trying to cover
[10:08] um something here on a study on the book
[10:10] of revelations uh this is message number
[10:13] 13 so we just keep on going and trying
[10:16] to understand
[10:18] but what has been our main point
[10:20] see a lot of people have told us you
[10:22] know stay out of the book of revelations
[10:23] you can't understand it
[10:25] well that's true if you don't know what
[10:28] it's saying you know and you don't
[10:30] understand the the uh the symbols the
[10:33] things you know
[10:34] that are there
[10:36] but
[10:37] then when once you see the book of
[10:39] revelations though then you can see that
[10:41] it is a very simple book
[10:43] it just needs our understanding to be
[10:46] changed instead of trying to figure out
[10:48] all of these monsters and beasts
[10:50] and get our mind out of the tv world and
[10:53] movie industry you know that's running
[10:55] all this garbage can stuff and get it
[10:58] down to simple thinking
[11:00] then you know we can can uh
[11:03] begin to understand and what is our
[11:05] point that we've made
[11:07] in the book of revelations it is the
[11:10] only book the prophet said whereas jesus
[11:12] christ personally appearing to ascribe
[11:16] to write the book
[11:18] into what is it we just read it's the
[11:20] revelation that god give to jesus to
[11:22] give to john you say well that's
[11:23] trinitarianism isn't it no no
[11:27] that's no more than i'm a father son
[11:29] holy ghost i'm a person i'm a
[11:32] general motors employee i'm a pastor of
[11:34] a church i'm many many different
[11:36] manifestations
[11:37] but uh there's just one of me
[11:40] and there's just one true and living god
[11:42] so that's where we we believe it all
[11:44] right now
[11:45] then as i told you the book of
[11:47] revelations you won't find
[11:49] um the lord jesus christ just
[11:51] specifically by himself that's right
[11:54] it's a it's a book dedicated
[11:56] specifically to express
[12:00] what he
[12:01] was
[12:02] he is
[12:04] and always will be
[12:05] because we read in hebrews 13 8 that
[12:08] says he's jesus christ the same
[12:10] yesterday
[12:11] today and forever
[12:14] so now we know that jesus the flesh
[12:16] wasn't back in the old testament with
[12:18] the same god
[12:19] that was back there one day walked on
[12:21] the shores of galilee back there
[12:23] and you know in a human body right and
[12:26] now that sign god is living in the bride
[12:28] of jesus christ
[12:30] here
[12:31] living and has been down through ever
[12:33] since the day of pentecost
[12:35] living in each one of the church ages
[12:37] through the bride of christ
[12:39] all right and seeing them that's the the
[12:42] point is to see ourselves that's right
[12:45] and what the word of god is talking
[12:47] about
[12:48] you and i
[12:50] see if you ever want to find yourself
[12:51] just read the book of revelation right
[12:53] then you read about these things and but
[12:55] when you get to the to the points of
[12:58] some kind of a symbol
[13:00] just remember the bible is written to
[13:03] hide it from the eyes of the wise
[13:07] now we think it's been written to where
[13:09] it can be explained
[13:10] no jesus said it was written to hide it
[13:13] from the wise and prudent
[13:16] the word that everybody can't comprehend
[13:18] it and then we read in the bible where
[13:20] it says no man can call jesus the christ
[13:22] except it be by the holy ghost
[13:25] you see anybody you can get anybody to
[13:26] stop him on the road and get drunk as a
[13:28] coot and he can say jesus is the christ
[13:30] yeah but that don't mean he's saved
[13:32] no it's when you've got an experience in
[13:34] your heart
[13:36] and then you speak from your heart who's
[13:38] dwelling inside of you
[13:40] and then you can say
[13:42] that it's jesus christ
[13:44] all right so we got down
[13:46] uh there this past sunday
[13:48] trying to deal with
[13:50] where we're over in chapter four
[13:52] if you want to
[13:54] go over to chapter four with us and
[13:56] uh they don't have to pull this up but
[13:59] we'll read a little bit from revelation
[14:01] chapter 4
[14:02] in verse 6 because we've taken our time
[14:05] coming down to
[14:06] to this position
[14:08] and uh
[14:10] verse 6 it says before the throne
[14:14] see now let's
[14:16] you know let me express that because you
[14:17] go to revelation 4 1 through there and
[14:20] it talks about a throne we see you're
[14:22] looking for some kind of a great big
[14:23] throne
[14:25] you know
[14:26] well
[14:28] how could you have that big old throne
[14:29] and a whole lot of people sitting on it
[14:31] it'd be a big old throne
[14:33] but see the throne is the kingdom of god
[14:35] amen that's right
[14:36] jesus when speaking there in revelation
[14:39] 3 21
[14:40] right along in there he said he that
[14:42] overcometh was it with me in my throne
[14:43] as i've overcome and sit with my father
[14:45] in his trunk
[14:46] all right so then the body
[14:49] the human element of god is in heaven
[14:51] right now it's not here upon earth
[14:54] and it's on the throne
[14:55] it's on the father's strong sitting
[14:57] waiting for a time and then when time is
[14:59] finished then he'll come here to pick us
[15:02] up and take us away
[15:03] all right
[15:04] now so then a throne in heaven is not a
[15:07] great big
[15:08] thing like that it's a kingdom it's
[15:10] domain
[15:11] it's a
[15:12] right
[15:13] it's a place you know understanding so
[15:16] then
[15:17] get that point and then you'll
[15:18] understand the rest and before the
[15:20] throne there was a sea of glass like a
[15:23] crystal this is john describing what he
[15:25] sees
[15:29] he's taken up as an example
[15:31] for you and i in revelations 4 1
[15:35] of the rapture of the church and going
[15:36] up into the heavenlies
[15:38] and as he's doing he's describing what
[15:40] he sees but what's he describing it by
[15:42] symbols right
[15:45] just like uh
[15:46] who was it ezekiel
[15:48] when he saw fire falling down out of
[15:50] heaven
[15:52] seeing a nuclear destruction
[15:56] well how did he describe it fire falling
[15:58] down out of heaven he didn't know to
[16:00] call it nuclear
[16:02] the word didn't exist right
[16:04] all right see naman says chariots
[16:07] jostling in the streets
[16:08] running like lightning
[16:10] well it's very simple symbolics if you
[16:12] just take it right
[16:13] what just you get out there this evening
[16:15] when you start going home you'll see
[16:17] what he's talking about right you'll see
[16:19] a bunch of cars running down the road
[16:20] with headlights on and that's what he
[16:22] saw
[16:23] but see it's breaking down into simple
[16:25] things
[16:27] and thank god that he sent us a profit
[16:29] to break these
[16:30] symbols down to us to where we could
[16:32] understand what the bible is talking
[16:34] about and that's the purpose and the
[16:36] reason for him coming right
[16:38] yes sir was to not bring us another
[16:40] bible
[16:41] not to give us something different
[16:43] but to bring to our understanding what
[16:46] is already written in the word of god
[16:49] amen
[16:51] leave them that way then we can
[16:52] understand it so watching what he's
[16:54] doing now he's describing what he sees
[16:58] but now watch him as he describes it
[17:01] i wish you could draw some of these
[17:02] things out
[17:04] you know
[17:05] but how are you going to draw it because
[17:07] he just
[17:09] and before the throne there was a sea of
[17:11] glice like at the crystal
[17:13] and in the midst of the throne
[17:17] and round about the throne
[17:19] now how can anything be into in human
[17:22] terminologies
[17:24] how can anything be in the midst of
[17:26] something and round about it
[17:28] right
[17:30] we automatically see that it's not
[17:32] talking about our human terminology
[17:35] see human terminology can't comprehend
[17:37] the word of god
[17:40] see but when you're seeing jesus christ
[17:42] make manifest here in these examples and
[17:45] all the things you can understand so
[17:47] what now
[17:48] there was in the midst
[17:50] of the throne and round about the throne
[17:52] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[17:55] behind
[17:58] now four beasts
[18:01] all right
[18:02] now
[18:03] we look at it like some kind of a movie
[18:05] that made with these great monsters you
[18:07] know king kong
[18:09] you know well now we're not going to see
[18:11] anybody right now your thought like that
[18:15] i'm in a great big animal walking across
[18:16] the earth going to deceive everybody
[18:19] no he's going to stomp everybody
[18:22] all right
[18:24] but now think about what it said and
[18:26] these four beasts were full of eyes
[18:28] before and behind that's right
[18:33] all right
[18:34] so now we found out there sunday that
[18:36] what our beast
[18:38] is a power
[18:42] know
[18:43] a beast you talk about a beast a horse a
[18:45] beast
[18:46] and you talk about horsepower
[18:50] it's the power of the beasts how much
[18:52] stress can be brought forth by the
[18:54] animal as you would say so then they
[18:56] come along they put it in a car and they
[18:58] made it out of metal and called it
[18:59] horsepower
[19:01] then they put in an airplane flew up the
[19:03] sky they caught it horsepower
[19:05] then they put in astronauts you know
[19:07] they put it in rockets and send them
[19:08] into outer space they call it horsepower
[19:12] it just simply means a power
[19:16] that you know can be used the thrust of
[19:18] it to do anything or the power that it
[19:20] is
[19:21] all right
[19:22] now so then we found out sunday that
[19:25] what
[19:26] this is a power among the people
[19:32] all right
[19:33] a power among the people
[19:37] we went back into ezekiel
[19:39] and picked up ezekiel
[19:41] where he was seeing
[19:43] this
[19:44] odd-looking contraption it looked like a
[19:47] um
[19:49] um
[19:51] it
[19:53] and then he'd see horses pull it and
[19:55] they'd be running like vitamin and
[19:56] they'd be just going every which way
[19:58] and then he finally wound up seeing the
[20:00] wheel in the middle of the wheel
[20:02] well see that wheel in the middle of the
[20:04] wheel is the lord jesus christ
[20:09] and that
[20:10] ezekiel was actually seeing
[20:13] the travel of israel right amen their
[20:16] journey down through the wilderness from
[20:18] leaving the you know canaan and i mean
[20:21] leaving uh
[20:23] egypt and going towards canaan
[20:26] and they were in travel right
[20:28] and ezekiel is explaining what's taking
[20:30] place
[20:33] that's a very simple understanding
[20:38] beast means power and you go to ezekiel
[20:40] you'll find that there are these same
[20:41] things now what kind of beast would it
[20:43] be full of eyes before and behind
[20:46] and the first beast was like a lion
[20:49] and the second beast like a calf or an
[20:51] ox
[20:52] and the third beast had a face of a man
[20:55] and the fourth beast was like a flying
[20:57] eagle amen
[20:59] now how could you draw that out
[21:02] what kind of a picture
[21:04] would you have if you were trying to
[21:06] draw out
[21:08] these things
[21:11] you can't do it so then you got to get
[21:14] down to see what they all represent
[21:17] and see as i said ezekiel
[21:19] it represented a travel
[21:22] of the children of israel
[21:24] that's what he saw
[21:26] he was raised up took up and saw their
[21:28] journey going down to the wilderness the
[21:31] travel
[21:32] that was taking place
[21:34] now then when it comes to the point
[21:37] that you see here in revelation
[21:40] john sees
[21:42] it raised up
[21:46] sitting in a position
[21:48] in heaven right
[21:51] all right
[21:52] so he sees this it's doing this brother
[21:54] reading him leaving against
[21:56] his brothers been in bad shape so
[21:59] let's just hold have a word of prayer
[22:01] when we have going to be evidently in
[22:03] bad shape lord jesus we ask you father
[22:06] to just bless
[22:07] brother there be with him and lord take
[22:10] care of everything
[22:11] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[22:13] name
[22:14] amen
[22:17] and see these
[22:19] these things is being described
[22:23] now you'll have to take my word on the
[22:25] basis of what doing to talking to you
[22:27] and i as far as
[22:28] some especially that um you know are not
[22:31] familiar with wordings we use but
[22:34] in the book of revelations you find the
[22:36] word beast
[22:39] all right in one form it is called a
[22:41] zoom z-o-o-n
[22:45] all right
[22:46] now in other instances that's taken from
[22:49] the greek other incidences are places
[22:52] it's called the ron
[22:54] p-a-t-r-i-o-n
[22:56] all right
[22:57] now the zune is a living creature
[23:01] amen
[23:03] but the theorem is a wild untamable
[23:06] beast
[23:10] unconverted
[23:11] i think wow
[23:13] so you got to know which beast you're
[23:14] talking about when it just says a beast
[23:16] all right these beasts that we're
[23:18] talking about here are the zoom z-o-o-n
[23:23] because they're the creatures
[23:26] they're actually not
[23:28] uh
[23:30] angels
[23:32] you've got to take it all the way
[23:33] through we will this coming sunday so
[23:34] don't worry about it
[23:37] don't try to get ahead of me
[23:40] they're not actually just to say angelic
[23:43] beings
[23:45] you know
[23:46] because you've got to deal with in
[23:48] heaven there's angels there were angels
[23:51] that failed
[23:52] all right for lucifer's life
[23:54] all right then there is a lower form of
[23:58] from coming down there is like seraphims
[24:02] then there's cherubims
[24:05] and then there's just angels
[24:07] and that's why they can fly through
[24:08] heaven and they can holler holy holy
[24:10] holy
[24:11] but those have never fallen
[24:15] they they don't have to be saved they
[24:17] didn't fall they didn't fall after
[24:19] satan's life
[24:20] the others did and they have their place
[24:21] waiting all right
[24:23] but when you come to hear say you're
[24:24] dealing with this
[24:26] living creature
[24:29] and that living creatures i said so when
[24:32] you there sunday then ezekiel saw it in
[24:34] travel with israel
[24:36] john saw it in the position and glory
[24:41] but then by being able to comprehend
[24:44] the signs and the things are taking
[24:46] place then the prophet of god could
[24:49] bring to you and i
[24:51] and we could see it down through the
[24:52] church ages and see what would take
[24:54] place amen
[24:55] all right so you got your line your ox
[24:58] your man and the eagle
[25:01] all right then you get into matthew mark
[25:04] luke and john that's right
[25:07] matthew was the line
[25:10] of the tribe of judah see coming down
[25:14] you'll find him being more word related
[25:16] on a lot of points
[25:18] mark
[25:20] his ox are symbolics you'll see more of
[25:23] the you know like mark 16 lay hands on
[25:25] the sick and they shall recover etc
[25:28] but then luke was a physician he was a
[25:31] doctor
[25:33] and he was a man smart right all right
[25:36] then john
[25:37] would be more into the eagle age or evil
[25:40] side
[25:41] because he was chosen to go to patmos
[25:43] and write the book of revelation
[25:45] so then you can tie it up and bring it
[25:47] all the way down and then you can come
[25:49] down to the ages
[25:50] and bringing it forth to be able to see
[25:54] you know
[25:55] the point but my main point is to get
[25:56] you to see one thing tonight what i was
[25:59] trying to get you to see there
[26:01] sunday
[26:03] you got to line the ox to man the eagle
[26:05] that was the ministry of god among
[26:07] mankind
[26:10] because when you started out you started
[26:12] out with an early church
[26:14] with the word of god amen
[26:18] in the book of acts
[26:20] and they held that true until you even
[26:21] get over into about the fourth church
[26:24] age where you're coming into you can see
[26:26] them back here behind listed
[26:28] like martin in the third church age
[26:31] but around said no man had a clear
[26:33] understanding of the godhead in saint
[26:35] martin
[26:36] great signs and wonders took place
[26:39] dead rays sick healed
[26:42] even columba
[26:44] we got to a chance when we were in
[26:45] ireland to to go over to
[26:48] they pronounced it clumba it's not
[26:50] colombo we use come low blow a lot of
[26:53] time but it's not just columba
[26:55] all right and we had an opportunity to
[26:57] actually visit his home place you know
[26:59] it fell down and all the work was
[27:01] but
[27:03] he was a great man of god these men stay
[27:07] true with the word of god amen
[27:09] then you get what would be known in the
[27:11] church realms of calling
[27:13] the dark ages
[27:17] in the dark ages you find that there was
[27:19] a lot of people killed
[27:21] there are
[27:22] 68 million by the catholics on records
[27:26] of christians that they killed that's
[27:28] right oh of course
[27:30] they claim they've repented of it
[27:33] well i'd like to see it but that's what
[27:35] they say
[27:36] you know
[27:37] but they're still doing all of the
[27:39] things but anyhow
[27:41] the oxy during that period of time there
[27:43] was a sacrifice if you wanted something
[27:45] to read that's really great get the book
[27:47] fox's book of martyred right amen
[27:50] if you've got a good stomach you can
[27:51] read it
[27:53] you don't you won't be able to
[27:55] how that there's people holding a cross
[27:58] up in front of people that claim to be
[27:59] christians
[28:01] and saying deny your belief in jesus
[28:03] christ
[28:05] and accept virgin mary and her doctrine
[28:07] or we'll kill you
[28:10] that was the ox
[28:12] it was a spirit among the people amen
[28:18] just as it was with when you're coming
[28:20] down from paul iranius columba
[28:23] martin and him
[28:25] they were great men of god who stayed
[28:27] with the word of god and tried to hold a
[28:29] church straight right
[28:31] and in about 325 a.d they had what they
[28:34] called the nicean council
[28:37] and they started out picking up the
[28:39] doctrines of the trinity and the things
[28:41] from there
[28:43] to that point
[28:44] but see the ox was
[28:47] the sacrifice and you read that
[28:49] fox's book of martyrs work like i said
[28:52] here's one on one side claiming to be a
[28:53] christian the other one on the other
[28:55] side claiming to be a christian
[28:57] and they're
[28:58] they're killing the real true christians
[29:03] records of them cutting the women's
[29:05] belly open and taking the baby out and
[29:07] feeding it to the hogs
[29:08] right man you read the book
[29:11] that's what i said she got a good
[29:12] stomach
[29:13] that's records that's not
[29:15] something that was faked or ideas
[29:19] it was actually records of what took
[29:20] place
[29:22] i remember one of them was
[29:24] thor the butcher or something like that
[29:26] and he killed over a hundred people in
[29:28] one night
[29:30] but see they had the right to
[29:33] while they were catholic
[29:37] and they went down and they got
[29:38] forgiveness of their sins
[29:40] before
[29:42] they went out and done them
[29:44] so it didn't matter to them how many
[29:45] they killed or what they'd done but that
[29:47] was their ox
[29:50] that
[29:51] animal is sacrificed
[29:54] and jesus had already spoke
[29:57] he said unless a corn of wheat
[30:00] dies and goes into the ground
[30:03] said it will abide alone
[30:06] but said if it goes into the ground he
[30:07] said
[30:08] he'll come forth in other words in a
[30:10] multiple form just like you you put a
[30:12] grain of corn in the ground and then you
[30:14] go out later and you've got a ear of
[30:16] corn with
[30:17] many many many kernels right on what you
[30:21] you see
[30:22] that early church had to go into the
[30:24] ground right
[30:26] but then it started coming back out
[30:29] and a man named martin luther
[30:32] then he went forth with a message
[30:34] of the judge shall live by faith yes he
[30:36] did
[30:38] sure there was a lot of fanaticism with
[30:40] it
[30:41] sure there was a lot of
[30:43] wrongdoings with it but still it was the
[30:45] word of god
[30:48] it was a reformation
[30:50] to begin to be reformed for what they
[30:52] were right
[30:54] and it wasn't long until
[30:56] luther and their teachings and he had
[30:59] passed on you know and they cured his
[31:00] message
[31:02] and they got it sold to it was just
[31:04] looking back just like it was before
[31:06] because
[31:07] they got it to the place that
[31:09] they wouldn't even have a revival in the
[31:11] church because and i'm quoting from the
[31:13] church history
[31:14] of the baptist church
[31:17] that they wouldn't even have a revival
[31:18] in the old what they call
[31:20] independent badges
[31:22] and the reason for not having revival
[31:24] was they thought somebody might get
[31:26] saved that god didn't want them to get
[31:28] saved
[31:32] now that's in history
[31:35] see they got it down to where it was
[31:37] just
[31:38] we're just living our lives we're
[31:40] christians with john wesley come out
[31:42] amen started preaching sanctification
[31:46] bring the church out of those things
[31:49] and bring it back to a a life lived
[31:52] right
[31:53] he even said it the black coffee had no
[31:56] benefit in it
[31:58] his house burnt down one time and
[32:01] they called him he got there as it was
[32:02] falling in according to records
[32:05] and he looked around he said well we
[32:06] don't have to worry about this anymore
[32:09] right
[32:12] literally recorded in his own writings
[32:16] that he was trying his best to live a
[32:18] good christian life
[32:19] yeah
[32:20] now where's the message today we're not
[32:22] throwing off on them but i'm just asking
[32:23] the question
[32:27] john wesley's talked so much on on
[32:29] doings until
[32:31] you know they turned against him right
[32:34] and even his own wife according to
[32:36] records
[32:37] would drag him around in the house by
[32:39] the hair of his head
[32:42] and he wouldn't step on him
[32:47] so sure i wouldn't let my wife do that
[32:49] well maybe we don't have what john
[32:51] wesley come on
[32:56] right
[32:57] right maybe we don't have what he had
[33:02] see there was your man
[33:04] shrewd
[33:06] but see first was the line the next was
[33:09] an ox
[33:10] those are symbolics of
[33:12] animals
[33:14] but then the third was turned to a man
[33:16] see
[33:17] smart shrewd man
[33:22] and god dealt with mankind through those
[33:24] ages under that
[33:26] spirit of that time that power that was
[33:29] among the people
[33:30] that he sent out
[33:32] right
[33:34] then you even come on over into azusa
[33:36] street
[33:38] bring in your pentecostals because azusa
[33:41] street was not
[33:43] the one that's doctrine
[33:46] there were trinitarians on azusa street
[33:48] still under the man
[33:50] and dealing with those things
[33:53] all right
[33:54] and see then the one this doctrine began
[33:56] about somewhere around 1914 12-14
[34:00] of the oneness doctrine and came out and
[34:02] began to do and the
[34:04] ones that were original of justice
[34:06] street a lot of turned against
[34:09] the truth when the oneness began to come
[34:11] forth
[34:13] but see there's your line your ox
[34:15] and your man down to the ages
[34:19] but they're on azusa street
[34:21] a great thing happened because
[34:25] it was the power of god coming back
[34:27] among the church that's right that's
[34:28] right but around him on 464 the seal
[34:31] book
[34:32] said another great prophet
[34:36] then he said there was a messenger sent
[34:37] at the end of the age right the road
[34:39] around never come to zeus's street
[34:41] he said you try to make me the pastor or
[34:43] the leader of zeus treat he said
[34:46] you have him in the wrong place
[34:49] did he come on after resistance
[34:52] see then he was the equal man
[34:55] but remember lion ox man eagle
[34:59] he was the eagle
[35:02] he was a prophet amen
[35:05] jehovah eagle
[35:08] prophets in the bible were referred to
[35:10] as eagles why because they could raise
[35:12] that way above and see a way over right
[35:15] amen
[35:17] around here we we very rarely see eagles
[35:23] because they're not subject to this part
[35:25] they are a few here they've tried to
[35:27] install them again and the swamps has
[35:29] got a few and different things but
[35:33] eagles like to live where they can soar
[35:35] high and go amen
[35:39] see a prophet is signified as an eagle
[35:41] because he has great
[35:42] eyesight right
[35:45] you wouldn't do a a pigeon or something
[35:47] like that or even a
[35:49] hulk that is a cousin to an eagle
[35:53] but that hawk can't see like that angel
[35:57] that eagle can sit in his eyes as a way
[35:59] it can fold over he can fly straight
[36:02] into the sun
[36:06] right into it
[36:10] see because
[36:12] he's made that away
[36:14] amen that's right see then malachi 4
[36:16] said that they would be a prophet come
[36:18] amen
[36:21] and a prophet in this age see bringing
[36:23] the message into it
[36:26] now just like the other day when they
[36:27] were had that thing on the tv thing
[36:30] they say there's over 2 million people
[36:32] now following this message
[36:34] you think this is a small thing it's
[36:36] beginning to be a big group
[36:38] over 2 million people already on record
[36:41] that are following this message
[36:43] around the world
[36:44] all right
[36:47] see but now a lot of people sure have
[36:49] made wrong things out of it that's true
[36:50] because they always done it in the days
[36:52] of martin luther they've done the same
[36:54] thing right amen the days of john wesley
[36:56] they saw done the same thing
[36:59] just the street is the same thing
[37:02] but the fourth one was to be the eagle
[37:06] because an eagle is a special made bird
[37:09] he's a ripper with a beak you want to
[37:11] eat now listen
[37:13] watch what i say and then what's what
[37:15] i'd say again behind it
[37:17] a real true eagle that you're talking
[37:19] about symbolic of a prophet
[37:22] is an eagle that is a ripper with a beak
[37:24] that
[37:25] he won't eat nothing rotten
[37:28] right all right but there's over 40
[37:31] something different kinds of
[37:34] eagles but around stephen said that
[37:39] 40 something different kinds they're
[37:40] actually eagles that are almost vultures
[37:44] they'll eat just anything
[37:47] those are not symbolic
[37:49] right
[37:50] you can't use that as an example
[37:55] but you see a real true eagle
[37:59] in order to get those takes on the
[38:00] eagles when the man that baptist
[38:02] preacher was preaching it was kids i
[38:04] think you know he was preaching the
[38:06] message about the eagles and how they're
[38:08] done and how they they go through what
[38:10] they call a moping period and how you
[38:12] pronounce it
[38:13] they go so far and then they just start
[38:17] covering over with all kind of
[38:19] fungus-like stuff and stuff gets on
[38:21] their beaks and they can't eat they
[38:23] hardly do nothing
[38:25] but if they can make it through that
[38:26] period of time
[38:29] and the other eagles that have done been
[38:30] through it
[38:31] they'll go up and get meat and drop it
[38:38] if
[38:40] if that eagle can get enough meat to
[38:42] live
[38:44] he renews his strength what the bible
[38:46] says right here
[38:48] amen he comes forth just like he was you
[38:51] heard of you
[38:54] he always goes
[39:00] to the rock
[39:02] where he was born from
[39:06] that's his resting place
[39:09] but he comes for strong that's right
[39:12] but he has to do a lot of things to do
[39:13] that he has to actually knock that stuff
[39:15] off his weight he has to get enough
[39:16] strength his
[39:18] feathers come down all kinds of things
[39:20] happen
[39:22] but that's a real true equal we're not
[39:24] talking about the 40 different kinds now
[39:26] so somebody hear it they think we oh
[39:28] they don't know there's many vulture
[39:30] eagles yeah we'll just put it up front
[39:32] here and tell you there are plenty of
[39:33] them
[39:35] because they have a lot of hypocrites
[39:37] around this message that are calling
[39:38] themselves eagles too that's right
[39:41] you need to make it a good buzzard right
[39:48] it's where i don't pull no bones
[39:51] yeah i stand on what i stand on and say
[39:54] it period
[39:56] right
[39:57] but listen
[39:58] equals now
[40:02] everybody okay is the part of the combat
[40:04] beast for the line the ox the man
[40:06] and they'll say it's the spirit among
[40:08] the people but then when you come into
[40:10] this message
[40:12] and you begin to think about this fourth
[40:14] combat beast to be the eagle
[40:17] we'll see they say yeah that was brother
[40:19] brown
[40:21] now brother branham wouldn't god that's
[40:24] right we don't believe in junk that's
[40:26] right
[40:29] brother random himself i was listening
[40:31] to a man the other night now i just
[40:33] thought he didn't emphasize enough we
[40:35] was but
[40:36] brother brown made mistakes in life he
[40:39] was a human being right
[40:40] you know that moses made a mistake
[40:43] moses smoked the rock when he was told
[40:45] to speak to the rock read your mouth
[40:48] those prophets themselves in their lives
[40:50] had
[40:51] problems because they were not what is
[40:53] the word they were not infallible
[40:55] right
[40:57] but here is the one point
[40:59] their message was yes sir amen
[41:04] sure martin luther was a trinitarian
[41:07] and even okay to kill him to the jews or
[41:09] so they need to be killed
[41:14] but yet his message of the just shall
[41:16] live by faith is infallible right amen
[41:19] now not what man has took and added to
[41:21] and done this out of the other but the
[41:23] message of the justice by faith is the
[41:25] word of god the word of god is
[41:26] infallible
[41:30] but the person that is in
[41:34] can make mistakes and things right
[41:37] there's no problem with that that's just
[41:39] the human side of it
[41:41] that's what caught me in the message was
[41:42] the honesty of a man
[41:44] that would tell his about his own
[41:46] thoughts and failures
[41:50] he wasn't telling all how good he good
[41:52] he was he was telling the truth about
[41:53] his life and what he was going to do
[41:56] he was going to take that gun and kill
[41:57] them boys
[41:59] to turn pumped out 20 something bullets
[42:02] trying to kill these boys and them
[42:03] running because they beat him up and
[42:05] everything
[42:07] he went back and took the bullets and
[42:08] put him in the gun and everyone fired
[42:11] it was god taking care of him
[42:14] he got so down and out when his wife and
[42:16] baby died until he climbed a pole
[42:20] that's what he was kind of like a
[42:21] lineman of different different things
[42:22] you know
[42:23] and do it
[42:25] took the glove off and was going to take
[42:26] a hold of the power line
[42:28] he was a human being
[42:31] and when he come to
[42:33] he was laying on the ground
[42:38] god took care of his man but the man
[42:40] himself sure run around
[42:42] the man the human being he was a human
[42:44] that made mistakes
[42:48] dr whitehorse writer was a the holy
[42:50] ghost
[42:52] and then had to change that to where it
[42:54] would be the antichrist when the seals
[42:56] would break
[42:58] but his message was infallible
[43:01] that's what i'm saying
[43:03] i'm saying that we're following an info
[43:05] this bible to me this bible the message
[43:07] of this bible is infallible
[43:10] this is the word of god amen
[43:13] if not what do you believe
[43:15] you believe you are him yeah
[43:19] if you don't believe this bible is the
[43:20] word of god you believe you're god
[43:22] no no no brother i don't believe i'm god
[43:25] well why are you trying to straighten
[43:26] everything out yeah that's right
[43:31] i told somebody this morning about it i
[43:33] said
[43:36] you know
[43:38] i didn't use these words but i'll use it
[43:40] here
[43:42] you know
[43:44] the devil's angels is all gone on
[43:46] vacation
[43:54] let's think about what i said
[43:57] all the angels of the devil the devil
[43:59] is going on vacation why don't make them
[44:01] no more
[44:03] preachers in this messages or nothing
[44:07] devil don't need no angels
[44:10] you got a lot of them
[44:12] and the bible says they're called as
[44:14] ministers of righteousness
[44:16] amen
[44:20] but it's the combat beast
[44:22] but my point has been what
[44:26] you go down the road and you look out
[44:27] and you see eagles on the buildings of
[44:30] people that are not even know anything
[44:31] about what we talk about a prophet eagle
[44:34] you see them on people's houses
[44:36] you go in a store and look around in a
[44:38] novelty store and before you leave
[44:40] you're going to see a bunch of eagles
[44:41] right right
[44:43] come on you didn't think about it
[44:45] this is the equal age
[44:48] this is the age and time of finishing
[44:50] all things up being the eagle age
[44:56] see it started by profit being able to
[44:58] bring a message to you and i am
[45:03] but he wasn't the only eagle
[45:05] right
[45:06] and we're certainly not talking about
[45:08] somebody come to bring another message
[45:10] beside the prophet
[45:12] right man
[45:13] no
[45:16] but what are we
[45:18] amen
[45:22] what are we church that's my point
[45:23] tonight what are we
[45:27] i believe that combat beast was in those
[45:30] people in that early age
[45:33] and you had the forerunner people of
[45:36] paul and irenaeus and them
[45:38] sure they were the messengers of the age
[45:40] but the spirit of that age was in the
[45:42] people
[45:44] amen yes sir so is it in this end time
[45:47] that when the prophets
[45:48] came and brought the message unto us
[45:54] early man years ago most of you would
[45:56] have got up and run out of the building
[45:57] a lot of you would
[45:58] heard a man and he said
[46:00] should you say brother around as a
[46:02] prophet said he just to come make way
[46:03] for the prophets
[46:06] and i thought i'm going to listen to
[46:07] what he's got to say
[46:09] of course it didn't take me long to
[46:11] figure out what he's talking about
[46:13] he thought he was the next messenger to
[46:14] take over
[46:16] you know but we don't need no next
[46:18] messenger to take over that's right
[46:21] this message has introduced us to jesus
[46:23] christ
[46:25] that's the one is to take over
[46:27] not samuel dale or nobody else right
[46:33] it's god himself to bring his own
[46:35] message to the people now
[46:38] did we say we believe the fightful
[46:40] ministry to take this message and sweep
[46:42] it on to the coming of the lord within
[46:44] the fivefold ministry you mean they're
[46:45] not worth nothing they're not in
[46:46] anything
[46:51] see church if we just knew what happened
[46:58] if we would just realize what happened
[47:00] there
[47:00] in the end time when that prophet
[47:02] brought that message to the people and
[47:04] the people began to be the message of
[47:05] the prophet right
[47:10] you know
[47:12] you know we talk a lot about david and
[47:14] that's wonderful
[47:18] hey would kill goliath
[47:21] that's great
[47:24] wonderful statements
[47:26] but you know david then he just went
[47:28] over and sat down
[47:30] he's done his job
[47:33] the children of israel is one whip the
[47:35] rest of them
[47:38] we don't think about that dude
[47:41] maybe you don't like my words maybe
[47:43] they're not good words or just see
[47:44] anyone over inside them
[47:49] my point is he done his job
[47:53] when his job was finished it was up to
[47:55] somebody else to take over
[47:57] right
[47:59] see
[48:00] the prophet of god come and brought us a
[48:02] message we've got the books to take your
[48:04] computer you run off anything you desire
[48:08] of what he had to say
[48:13] but what about in our hearts and mind
[48:14] amen
[48:18] oh but brother dale we're we're up above
[48:20] all of this we're not in them
[48:21] denominations and things
[48:24] it's all right we're independent
[48:32] but we're going to read in a minute
[48:33] where brother brown said a baptist or a
[48:35] methodist
[48:36] can give birth to an eagle
[48:44] you're gonna have to argue with your
[48:45] prophet
[48:50] that's where people don't like me
[48:51] because i find what he says and and i
[48:53] bring it to us and try to show it to us
[48:58] but i believe in the spirit of jesus
[49:00] christ being in you and i all right amen
[49:06] that prophet was not almighty god but
[49:08] god used that prophet to bring a mention
[49:11] moses wasn't god but you ever heard
[49:13] brother brown say it like this he said
[49:14] when moses was speaking he said he was
[49:16] god to the people but said when he
[49:18] stepped back
[49:20] he was moses again
[49:22] all right when he was up here speaking
[49:24] to the people the message was infallible
[49:31] come on but when he stepped back he was
[49:33] human
[49:35] he had problems
[49:39] brother made a statement one time he
[49:41] said one of these days said the black
[49:43] and white will fight again and die like
[49:44] flies
[49:47] that's a direct statement
[49:51] but you go to the next message
[49:55] he said i made that statement this
[49:56] morning that the white and black would
[49:58] fight again in dallas life he said that
[50:00] was just my opinion
[50:02] he said that wouldn't does the lord
[50:10] you see the man himself can be a problem
[50:13] but his message is what i meant
[50:16] that's all i've ever done right
[50:19] is try to
[50:20] get you to look into the bible and take
[50:23] what the prophet has brought to us like
[50:25] the book of revelation
[50:26] breaking these symbols to it making it
[50:28] simple enough until a 9th grade idiot
[50:31] like myself can comprehend
[50:34] what is being said
[50:39] our children know more about the truth
[50:41] of god's word
[50:42] than most theologians in the
[50:44] denomination that we're in america
[50:49] why because we've heard the truth amen
[50:54] right what is it
[50:59] one beast was like a lion next beast was
[51:01] like a man
[51:03] that i mean a calf the next beast was
[51:04] like a man
[51:06] and the lights was a
[51:08] flying eagle
[51:10] you know the other three could take to
[51:12] the air
[51:14] the line the oxaman they couldn't take
[51:16] to the air they had to have some support
[51:18] to be able to get them up into the air
[51:20] but the eagle doesn't have to that's
[51:21] right that's right
[51:25] he just swore
[51:27] i told you about it
[51:30] i experienced it myself seeing one
[51:32] i was sitting in a place over in south
[51:34] carolina hunting down in the swamp and
[51:36] there's a great big cut this way went
[51:38] about probably 300 yards and it was
[51:40] about 50 yards wide and a big cut going
[51:42] this way perfect place to hunt because i
[51:44] could cover both food plots you know
[51:47] sitting right in the middle and i could
[51:48] look this way that way you know
[51:51] i was sitting up there and i looked and
[51:53] i seen this thing come down and wider
[51:54] wings than my arms
[51:57] and it just dropped right down in coming
[51:59] this way and it came right up to that
[52:01] thing
[52:01] right to the middle of it and turned and
[52:03] went right out the other way and went
[52:05] right out the other end of it and it was
[52:07] down in the trees where i was at
[52:10] i was sitting up probably maybe 12 15
[52:13] feet high he was down in there where i
[52:15] was at having that cut he never flapped
[52:17] one wing
[52:19] he soared and turned and went right down
[52:22] never flopped the wing he went right up
[52:24] over them trees it was 30 40 feet high
[52:27] he just went right up like that and
[52:28] soared out
[52:32] he knew how to handle this all right
[52:36] that's what god likens his prophets to
[52:38] eagles right
[52:40] he's jehovah eagle amen
[52:44] but now who are we
[52:50] who are we
[52:51] i don't know how far we got along with
[52:53] what we're doing but
[52:54] brother joe just pull up for
[52:57] the number nine and ten
[53:00] which is matthew 24 and luke 17.
[53:05] i take them a little bit because when i
[53:07] give them these they're way over in the
[53:08] message
[53:09] all right here's matthew 24 28 it says
[53:12] or wheresoever the carcass is there will
[53:15] the eagle be
[53:17] nine safe
[53:21] did i miss revenge
[53:29] that's how easy it is but we read it
[53:31] this way
[53:32] for whatsoever the carcass is there will
[53:34] the eagles be getting together yet
[53:36] brother brown
[53:40] it doesn't say that right
[53:43] the eagles
[53:48] all right now i can't express it and
[53:50] i'll express it again
[53:52] i'm not talking about somebody else to
[53:54] come to take over in this message
[53:56] now get that out of the ideas now if you
[53:58] and on tape or anybody else
[54:01] 40 something years i've been around i
[54:02] ain't done it yet so don't worry about
[54:04] it
[54:05] i ain't trying to find somebody to take
[54:07] over i know who took over when that
[54:09] prophet left the scene
[54:11] the lord jesus christ because that's who
[54:12] he was looking for to come and back him
[54:15] up
[54:18] he said in the seal book there'll be a
[54:19] great one come he did
[54:21] he came to that opening of the word and
[54:24] backed up what that man said
[54:26] yes sir
[54:27] so the dead was raised the sick was
[54:29] healed all kind of things took place
[54:33] but you see we come over in this and say
[54:34] well it's not for you and i great men
[54:36] have said that third pull you know it's
[54:38] not for us but brother around said it
[54:40] was far
[54:41] the bride and the church that's right
[54:45] and to the totally lost that's a direct
[54:47] quote
[54:48] do it evidence to somebody
[54:53] you ever seen the debt ready
[54:54] i have so we don't have to worry about
[54:56] it
[54:59] you don't have to worry about nobody
[55:01] gonna argue with nobody about to take no
[55:02] argument about it that's right
[55:04] no man can raise the dead
[55:08] that's god to raise the dead
[55:10] god can use man to raise the dead
[55:12] talk to brother dick letter about if you
[55:14] want to in the presbyterian church when
[55:16] they raised people was raised in the
[55:17] dead
[55:21] see we only want to take it over to
[55:22] brother branham now i'll go to the next
[55:24] one luke i'll have this one
[55:26] this is the same state but look what it
[55:28] said and they answered and said unto him
[55:31] we're lord and he said unto them
[55:33] wheresoever the body is
[55:37] neither will the eagles be gathered
[55:39] together
[55:40] the body word
[55:43] right
[55:44] carcass
[55:46] is an animal right a dead animal a
[55:47] carcass we call it
[55:50] eagles eat as i said the eagles we refer
[55:52] to as in the bible form he's only a
[55:55] ripper of the beak that will eat
[55:57] fresh killed meat
[56:02] he ain't like some of these things that
[56:03] take the animals and just stuff them up
[56:05] there and leave them a little rotten
[56:06] about highway go back and eat on it
[56:09] you've got to be fresh
[56:13] the fresh word of
[56:14] god where the word of god is the eagle
[56:17] shall be gendered amen around that word
[56:21] amen
[56:22] now come on folks why don't we talk
[56:24] plain what are you doing here
[56:26] all right
[56:30] what are you doing here
[56:32] i don't mind talking like that
[56:34] now a lot of you probably don't want to
[56:35] be here and when i preach you you don't
[56:37] agree with that's all right that's your
[56:39] business
[56:40] maybe you don't have nowhere else to go
[56:44] but what brought you here
[56:50] certainly wasn't a beautiful church in a
[56:53] fine pastor and a big choir
[56:58] no
[57:00] putting up with me
[57:03] see church
[57:06] we are little eaglets
[57:09] we are the children of god if he
[57:12] referred to himself as being jehovah
[57:14] equal why can't we refer to ourselves as
[57:16] being his children amen
[57:19] i thought by the new birth we were the
[57:20] children of god
[57:23] and we're little eaglets all right
[57:30] so get them two scriptures now
[57:33] that we use
[57:34] where the carcass is
[57:36] the eagles
[57:38] plural will gather
[57:42] where the body is
[57:45] the eagles will gather to that body word
[57:48] amen
[57:50] why have you come to this church
[57:55] that's right
[57:58] most of you have told me personally they
[58:00] didn't have another word where you was
[58:01] at so much reason you come here
[58:03] right
[58:06] that's not bragging on nothing but jesus
[58:08] christ
[58:10] that don't exalt me that exhausts jesus
[58:12] christ
[58:14] because you see i know who the jehovah
[58:16] evil is and i know who was his eagle
[58:18] that prophet that brought the message
[58:20] to us
[58:23] but i know you and i are supposed to be
[58:25] eagles yep right
[58:26] amen
[58:31] you wouldn't just as he saw it in the
[58:32] sky we've got a sword in the sky
[58:35] that's right
[58:39] somebody's going to walk off this earth
[58:40] one of these days in the rapture
[58:43] we better consider the eagle and
[58:45] especially to put it to eagle with an
[58:47] astronaut
[58:49] now time i read that
[58:52] an eagle is like an astronaut
[58:58] never been ladies have an astronaut for
[59:00] this age
[59:04] they started flying planes back there
[59:07] right close at the ending up with zeus
[59:09] street
[59:12] but no astronauts
[59:16] this is the astronaut age right
[59:21] you see an astronaut he don't have
[59:23] anything to do
[59:25] with getting where he's going
[59:26] he just gets in the plane
[59:29] he has no control of the takeoff right
[59:34] the people in the towers once guided me
[59:39] so it's nothing but jesus christ all
[59:41] right let's read a little bit
[59:44] okay just get the point to where you can
[59:46] see it
[59:53] i'll just scan through to pick up some
[59:54] of the pull-up number
[59:56] seven brother
[59:59] anderson he's back there now
[1:00:02] appreciate these brothers
[1:00:05] that's right
[1:00:06] look what your prophet had to say about
[1:00:08] it he's talking about revelations 10 7
[1:00:10] he's been referring to the last angel's
[1:00:12] message what was to happen and all the
[1:00:14] mysteries of god would be revealed you
[1:00:16] see the four beasts that rode that was
[1:00:18] perfectly right that's still alive the
[1:00:19] oxymoron evil
[1:00:21] you believe that
[1:00:23] and now here's each age and each power
[1:00:25] that road behind it and there is a
[1:00:27] scripture that shows what that what the
[1:00:29] enemy's ride did
[1:00:31] now remember the bible says when the
[1:00:32] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[1:00:34] of the lord will raise up a standard
[1:00:36] right not me and you raising up one the
[1:00:39] spirit of the lord raised up the
[1:00:40] standard
[1:00:44] did that's been revealed and they sealed
[1:00:46] and also it's been revealed now that
[1:00:48] each big power that god set out to
[1:00:49] combat is hit exactly on the dot up to
[1:00:52] the eagle time
[1:00:55] now if this is the last time there will
[1:00:57] become
[1:00:58] an eagle that's right and that now
[1:01:01] remember now in the days that the line
[1:01:03] came the original word about 100 of one
[1:01:07] 100 of them listened to the line and
[1:01:09] watching dropping dropping her in the
[1:01:11] days of the the ox came there was a
[1:01:14] teeny bit drop of them listening to the
[1:01:16] ox missile
[1:01:18] in the days that the man come he worked
[1:01:20] among men you see so he was shrewd he
[1:01:22] got a little group and what did they do
[1:01:25] satan's seen that so he just sends them
[1:01:28] right back and marries them into it and
[1:01:31] remember when the eagle finally comes
[1:01:34] it'll be 100 of one percent
[1:01:37] that listen
[1:01:39] it's an eagle age
[1:01:42] now
[1:01:43] i'm gonna go ahead and say it and then
[1:01:45] read it
[1:01:47] only eagles
[1:01:50] can eat eagle food
[1:01:53] you better realize you're an eagle right
[1:01:56] or you are not
[1:01:59] you're a vulture
[1:02:02] which one are you
[1:02:06] brother ryan said a true eagle will
[1:02:08] understand
[1:02:09] if he's a true evil
[1:02:13] now come on
[1:02:16] only eagles can understand the eagle
[1:02:18] message right
[1:02:21] yes
[1:02:23] we wouldn't design for no other age
[1:02:25] that's right it was designed for this
[1:02:27] age
[1:02:28] lutheran western didn't have no
[1:02:30] astronauts right right
[1:02:33] they even have airplanes
[1:02:38] but think about it
[1:02:41] when the eagle finally comes
[1:02:45] it'll be 100 to 1
[1:02:47] listen
[1:02:48] all right
[1:02:49] so let's take that 100th of one percent
[1:02:51] i'm not a mathematician i'm just saying
[1:02:53] this
[1:02:54] if there's two million people following
[1:02:56] this message that would probably be a
[1:02:58] whole lot less than one hundred to one
[1:03:00] percent
[1:03:03] when
[1:03:04] you know you consider that the baptist
[1:03:06] has probably got 500 million
[1:03:09] or more that was years ago
[1:03:11] you know
[1:03:13] so it's a small group right amen right
[1:03:17] even if it's 2 million that's a small
[1:03:19] group
[1:03:21] small percentage
[1:03:23] compared to what others are why because
[1:03:25] they won't hear it amen
[1:03:28] and listen church only as i said
[1:03:31] only eagles
[1:03:32] can understand
[1:03:34] right all right
[1:03:36] drop over to
[1:03:40] jump over to number 11 brother joe my
[1:03:42] brother
[1:03:44] anderson
[1:03:46] this is taken from shorts to father 1961
[1:03:50] 521
[1:03:52] and look what he says
[1:03:56] so i looked and this big eagle jumped up
[1:03:58] and talking about where he was at and
[1:03:59] out in the storm
[1:04:00] in colorado we have the brown eagle
[1:04:02] great big beautiful bird and i love
[1:04:04] eagles because god likens his children
[1:04:08] his heritage
[1:04:10] unto eagles
[1:04:13] and god himself calls himself an eagle
[1:04:16] he is jehovah equal papa eagle
[1:04:19] where his little eaglets
[1:04:22] an eagle can fly higher than any other
[1:04:24] bird there is if a halt would try to
[1:04:26] follow him he disintegrated in the iron
[1:04:30] so you try to impersonate christianity
[1:04:32] you just burst yourself open
[1:04:34] that's all don't do
[1:04:36] you no good
[1:04:38] be an eagle
[1:04:39] be born again
[1:04:41] nature change
[1:04:44] then you can walk with jacob up jacob's
[1:04:46] ladder
[1:04:50] get born again
[1:04:53] and under the anointing of the age that
[1:04:54] we are your eclipse
[1:04:56] right
[1:04:57] by the new birth amen
[1:05:01] no
[1:05:02] no no no no
[1:05:04] you'll get brother dick after services
[1:05:06] he's been watching for five years
[1:05:08] these eagles and how many has been born
[1:05:10] in this nest and
[1:05:12] how they all learn to fly and
[1:05:14] he's experienced it every day on this
[1:05:16] computer watching them do something
[1:05:17] different
[1:05:19] you know
[1:05:20] they're so nice they don't poop in the
[1:05:22] nest
[1:05:24] after they get big enough they hang over
[1:05:28] they'll be surprised when they're baking
[1:05:30] see a lot of things
[1:05:32] smart
[1:05:34] birds but get bored again
[1:05:38] right get a nature change
[1:05:40] why oh we're a pig
[1:05:42] a vulture
[1:05:44] right
[1:05:46] is that what we are when we're not
[1:05:47] converted
[1:06:01] he said letting off the pressure 1962.
[1:06:05] 609
[1:06:07] he said i was written here not too long
[1:06:08] ago i reached a subject called the
[1:06:11] eagle's church's nest in chicago i was
[1:06:13] reading about a certain kind of an eagle
[1:06:15] there's 40 different kinds of them they
[1:06:18] claim needs that ripper with the beak
[1:06:20] god always likens his people to eagles
[1:06:22] he calls himself jehovah eagle so he
[1:06:24] said 40 something different kinds of
[1:06:25] eagles all right
[1:06:27] so he knew what he's talking about
[1:06:29] and his little eaglets that's those who
[1:06:31] are born to him
[1:06:33] and i made a little remark of that one
[1:06:35] time talking about how the eagles gets
[1:06:38] little ones ready to fly takes them in
[1:06:40] the air and turns them loose
[1:06:42] you know they take them out there
[1:06:45] well they learn to fly
[1:06:47] under eagles
[1:06:50] well what good would it do to take a
[1:06:51] buzzer down
[1:06:56] what good would that be
[1:06:59] now watch what happens in the end time
[1:07:02] number 13.
[1:07:05] taken from the fifth seal of 63 322
[1:07:07] paragraph 188
[1:07:09] my a revealer of the truth that's been
[1:07:11] following all truth been falling all
[1:07:13] through the age
[1:07:14] so how in the world could the ox or the
[1:07:17] or the man
[1:07:18] or whatever beast was writing how could
[1:07:20] it ever be revealed until the eagles
[1:07:27] you read
[1:07:28] do i need to put my finger on it eagles
[1:07:31] come
[1:07:35] they had their place everybody had they
[1:07:37] were godly set beasts just the same as
[1:07:39] anybody else but the line was the
[1:07:41] original that's where the antichrist
[1:07:43] come up in the in combat then he raised
[1:07:45] up another power he sent a power to meet
[1:07:47] him he raised up another power and he
[1:07:49] sent another power to meet him and then
[1:07:51] as a life's power he
[1:07:53] brings down the eagle to restore the
[1:07:55] children back to the original faith
[1:07:57] again of the father
[1:07:58] fathers the eagle age
[1:08:01] need you to know research no more beasts
[1:08:02] there's nothing else out there all right
[1:08:04] going to the next i'm just reading these
[1:08:05] facts
[1:08:09] i don't want you to get it is it off the
[1:08:10] countdown 1962.
[1:08:13] now in this astronaut age
[1:08:16] now that's where we're at right
[1:08:21] there's also the astronaut age agent is
[1:08:23] spiritual
[1:08:24] what is it
[1:08:25] did the church come from an airplane
[1:08:28] like a natural they took a higher flight
[1:08:30] one that astronaut there's no airplane
[1:08:32] going to catch him
[1:08:33] he's done gone to where he can't
[1:08:35] even see an airplane no more
[1:08:39] see and that's the way god is doing now
[1:08:43] instead of being some little school
[1:08:45] guy come out and talk about certain
[1:08:47] things that dr so-and-so said years ago
[1:08:50] we got eagles plural prophets plural
[1:08:56] rising up into the heavenly the far
[1:08:59] above the earthbound chicken
[1:09:03] we've got eagles amen and we've got
[1:09:05] prophets amen
[1:09:07] well they know
[1:09:09] no there's not another major prophet
[1:09:13] but according to the scriptures there's
[1:09:15] apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[1:09:18] and teachers
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:22] that's in the body of christ that's the
[1:09:24] ministry right yeah
[1:09:26] but see we don't read those things
[1:09:29] so-and-so says it's that's what we take
[1:09:33] so we'll see in a minute he's not a
[1:09:35] feeder of eagles
[1:09:41] so what
[1:09:43] and if it happened in the horse and
[1:09:44] buggy days in the automobile days and
[1:09:46] the luther lutheran western what about
[1:09:48] now
[1:09:49] what's the matter people talking about
[1:09:51] being modern
[1:09:53] they call that modern this is the modern
[1:09:56] this is the modern
[1:09:58] according to the kingdom of god no
[1:10:03] astronauts glory astronaut age cure
[1:10:06] eagles
[1:10:08] god's prophets rising on the scene
[1:10:11] how thankful we are for that
[1:10:14] what is it spiritual manifestation of
[1:10:17] spiritual word become literally
[1:10:19] fulfilled before us that's right
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:23] the word of god manifested once was hard
[1:10:25] to understand now it's made plain to the
[1:10:28] astronaut
[1:10:29] the position of the church that should
[1:10:31] be plumb into the heavenlies
[1:10:33] not down here floating around through
[1:10:35] the clouds and buzzing around like an
[1:10:37] airplane but something that's propelled
[1:10:39] by something that sends it beyond
[1:10:41] anything
[1:10:42] that an airplane could think of it's an
[1:10:45] astronaut
[1:10:47] that's the age that we're living in now
[1:10:50] spiritual astronauts
[1:10:52] you know how that
[1:10:54] man
[1:10:56] always denies anything you know
[1:10:58] they said there was a person making a
[1:11:00] speech about one day that
[1:11:02] it would be to work our planes would you
[1:11:05] know people would start flying and doing
[1:11:07] different things
[1:11:10] and the story was told that this man got
[1:11:12] up and got his two sons and said let's
[1:11:13] get out of here
[1:11:15] he said this ain't nothing but just
[1:11:17] heresies this is this is stupid jump
[1:11:20] who could ever think about flying an
[1:11:21] airplane
[1:11:23] so he got his two sons and he walked out
[1:11:25] the door
[1:11:26] his two sons was named orville and
[1:11:28] wilbur wright
[1:11:32] so they evidently didn't listen to daddy
[1:11:36] right right
[1:11:38] see
[1:11:39] look mama she looked great mama was her
[1:11:42] day right
[1:11:44] that's wonderful
[1:11:45] i love my mother
[1:11:47] appreciated her for taking care of me
[1:11:48] and raising me i do
[1:11:53] but if mama was wrong
[1:11:55] mama was wrong
[1:11:59] i ain't saying my mama was wrong well
[1:12:01] she's wrong she's wrong
[1:12:04] i'll say it for you
[1:12:08] see that's not throwing off a mama mama
[1:12:10] didn't understand that's right man
[1:12:14] that's right i mean man used to think if
[1:12:16] we went out so far that the world was
[1:12:18] flat and you went out so far you just
[1:12:20] drop off the edge
[1:12:26] well you know what that kept ninety
[1:12:27] percent of people from going out to the
[1:12:29] edge
[1:12:30] that's afraid to fall off
[1:12:33] but you know someday one one guy went on
[1:12:35] out and he just went on out and he just
[1:12:36] went on out and
[1:12:39] don't find that he found out it was a
[1:12:40] curvature
[1:12:43] how many of you have ever been out in
[1:12:44] the ocean
[1:12:46] you've been out in the ocean right yeah
[1:12:48] you ever been 26 36 miles out
[1:12:54] you can't see a thing
[1:12:55] 12 miles i think is the limitation
[1:12:58] of when you're leaving out
[1:13:00] the land disappears and the lights is
[1:13:02] the highest building disappears
[1:13:05] well it's like somebody would have
[1:13:06] figured out that that was had to have
[1:13:07] something to do with the curvature
[1:13:10] but you know that
[1:13:12] you know now i can hear the quote from
[1:13:13] brother brown let me give you a quote
[1:13:15] he said see there the world has got four
[1:13:17] high points to it
[1:13:19] he said they proved it when they went to
[1:13:20] outer space
[1:13:22] they didn't say the world was flat
[1:13:25] he said that four high points to it
[1:13:28] but you see church listen
[1:13:31] it's time to get away from mama and
[1:13:34] daddy and
[1:13:35] and
[1:13:36] thanks hooty and
[1:13:38] whoever
[1:13:40] and get on in the word amen
[1:13:44] i asked josiah question one ago i said
[1:13:46] when that baby gets here friday
[1:13:48] will that make you a brother or a sister
[1:13:52] he thought for me and he said a brother
[1:13:57] well i was just asking the simple
[1:13:59] question
[1:14:01] but listen church
[1:14:05] do that get you the life get you off the
[1:14:06] astronauts
[1:14:09] the age of the astronauts
[1:14:12] we got equals
[1:14:14] we have profits
[1:14:18] because see i believe in the five four
[1:14:19] minutes
[1:14:20] yes sir
[1:14:25] in doing that then where are we
[1:14:30] glory astronaut age sure eagles
[1:14:34] god's prophets rising on the scene
[1:14:37] how thankful we are for that
[1:14:42] that's the quote of just opponents
[1:14:48] astronauts
[1:14:51] is eagles
[1:14:53] he goes beyond all denominational creeds
[1:14:58] all denominational barriers
[1:15:02] sailed into the heavenlies
[1:15:04] why because he's an eagle
[1:15:07] you know why an eagle can fly
[1:15:11] do you know why an eagle can fly
[1:15:13] because he's born an eagle
[1:15:15] right
[1:15:17] simply
[1:15:19] right that need anything that needed a
[1:15:20] big idea on your heads
[1:15:23] the reason that eagle can fly is because
[1:15:24] he's sneaking
[1:15:26] he's might go away
[1:15:30] he's made to fly
[1:15:35] see he's made to want fresh meat
[1:15:40] for the real true eagle
[1:15:41] that ever gets a good belly full of this
[1:15:43] word amen
[1:15:46] he just wants more worms right
[1:15:50] i mean i don't understand a man asked me
[1:15:53] the other day from ukraine he said
[1:15:56] he said you know should i go to a
[1:15:58] denominational church
[1:16:01] well if there's no place for him to go
[1:16:03] yeah sure because you're gonna go to
[1:16:05] church
[1:16:07] but if there's a church there that
[1:16:08] believes even part of the truth you'll
[1:16:10] go to that
[1:16:12] but if he's an eagle maybe he'll hear
[1:16:14] this
[1:16:15] if he's an eagle
[1:16:18] he only wants equal food
[1:16:21] but you know the little eagle that was
[1:16:23] hatched out in the chicken yard you
[1:16:24] remember the story
[1:16:28] that the old farmer took an eagle egg
[1:16:30] and put it under the hen you know and it
[1:16:32] hatched out funny looking chicken
[1:16:35] walking around you know
[1:16:37] but you know what he picked up worms
[1:16:40] and the stuff that the chickens need to
[1:16:43] live
[1:16:46] but one day his mama come over screaming
[1:16:50] and he took to the air
[1:16:53] well you know what a lot of people don't
[1:16:54] ever realize about that story was
[1:16:57] you know that little eagle took to the
[1:16:58] air
[1:17:00] and you know it wasn't long no mama
[1:17:02] chicken better run
[1:17:07] when he found out he's an eagle
[1:17:11] she better go high
[1:17:13] because he's hunting something deep
[1:17:17] right he's an eagle yeah
[1:17:19] the reason the eagle conflicts because
[1:17:21] he's an evil
[1:17:23] the reason people believe the word of
[1:17:24] god is because they're born again amen
[1:17:29] that's why we believe the word of god
[1:17:30] because we're born again people right
[1:17:34] all right
[1:17:35] see then we're not trying to figure out
[1:17:36] what somebody else is saying about it
[1:17:44] he said oh eagles
[1:17:46] today that's why you're here
[1:17:48] your eaglets
[1:17:50] but if the crust has begun to build
[1:17:53] blind your eyes
[1:17:55] the cures of the world
[1:17:58] you can't swallow all the food of god
[1:18:00] you know that's why i'm talking about
[1:18:01] the mop into the eagle so you just got
[1:18:03] to worry he can't eat nothing
[1:18:08] if he can survive long enough to get
[1:18:09] that to where he can break that off of
[1:18:11] and he can fly again
[1:18:13] that's the only animal that does that
[1:18:15] look at number 16
[1:18:20] i'm having to jump them back there so
[1:18:22] i'm sorry
[1:18:23] this is questions and answers reel 1
[1:18:26] 1964 8 23 in the morning
[1:18:29] you know that's what the uh
[1:18:32] the uh news thing they've got that now
[1:18:35] you know and some people don't know
[1:18:36] about it but they was
[1:18:38] they got it on there now you know i have
[1:18:40] a news
[1:18:41] cast up in
[1:18:42] uh indiana that's put out about brother
[1:18:45] branham and the things you know and
[1:18:47] they're really making a mockery out of a
[1:18:49] lot of things and it's on the tv
[1:18:52] and uh they said they still play them
[1:18:55] old 1200 and something tapes
[1:18:59] well i like what joseph said back to him
[1:19:01] is his response he said we're still
[1:19:04] reading that old bible
[1:19:06] that we've been reading now for
[1:19:08] thousands of years
[1:19:14] you just still reading that same mobile
[1:19:17] you know what i've got a lot of writings
[1:19:18] of luther as much as i get a hold of him
[1:19:21] i love to read about it
[1:19:23] i read the things of wesley
[1:19:26] i've read the things of azusa street i
[1:19:29] love to read them
[1:19:31] you know
[1:19:34] but then i read the message and like i
[1:19:35] said
[1:19:36] then the messenger of the man that
[1:19:38] brought the message he's got problems he
[1:19:40] had troubles he made mistakes and caught
[1:19:42] things wrong and different things
[1:19:44] but the message isn't followed
[1:19:48] so that's what i want amen
[1:19:50] that's the eagle's food right so watch
[1:19:52] what he's getting to matthew 24 28
[1:19:55] or whatsoever the carcass is
[1:19:57] there will the eagles be gathered
[1:20:00] together
[1:20:01] now that's what it's the person's
[1:20:03] question who is the carcass
[1:20:06] and who are the eagles
[1:20:09] oh that's a good question nothing wrong
[1:20:10] with that what is the carcass the
[1:20:12] carcass is what the eagles feed on
[1:20:15] now an eagle is considered in the bible
[1:20:17] of prophet prophet
[1:20:19] a prophet is the eagle god god calls
[1:20:22] himself an eagle and we're eglets then
[1:20:24] the believers you see
[1:20:26] and what is the carcass that they feed
[1:20:28] on it's the word
[1:20:31] wherever the word is the true nature of
[1:20:33] the bird will show itself
[1:20:37] now watch this in a minute
[1:20:41] because we're going to talk about
[1:20:42] vultures
[1:20:46] you know that vultures come around
[1:20:48] after the message
[1:20:51] has been destroyed
[1:20:57] no i'm not talking about the truth now
[1:20:58] so you get it off your head
[1:21:01] i'm talking about the people of this
[1:21:03] message that's made of the garbage can
[1:21:04] then it's become a place for vultures to
[1:21:06] feed right
[1:21:09] all right so this list will get to it
[1:21:11] he wants fresh meat he must have his
[1:21:13] fresh meat
[1:21:15] he's not a buzzard he's an eagle
[1:21:18] you can't give him no denominational
[1:21:19] stuff to him he's got to have eagles
[1:21:22] food
[1:21:23] that's the freshness of the meal
[1:21:25] not what
[1:21:26] moses done not what somebody else done
[1:21:29] not what sankey finney knocks calvin but
[1:21:32] right now
[1:21:35] don't then was right in her day
[1:21:37] where right now
[1:21:40] the meat that's killed for this day
[1:21:42] and that's the part of christ that died
[1:21:44] to make this word be confirmed
[1:21:47] that's what we want to eat on
[1:21:50] that's what eagles you know
[1:21:52] okay
[1:21:53] going to the next one
[1:22:04] he's not average to shook this is number
[1:22:05] 17.
[1:22:11] but the main point is just getting what
[1:22:12] we're talking about it's been hidden
[1:22:14] from the wives of the reformers chill
[1:22:16] away from it until the age
[1:22:18] of the eagles
[1:22:20] appeared
[1:22:25] he's not just saying right
[1:22:30] come on look at the next one number 18.
[1:22:35] she's not able to show up same message
[1:22:37] did you ever see an eagle compromise
[1:22:40] no sir there's no compromising in him
[1:22:42] neither does a genuine christian he
[1:22:44] ain't soft he'll hunt till he finds it
[1:22:47] amen yes sir he'll find his meat he
[1:22:50] wants fresh manna he'll get down there
[1:22:52] and dig till he finds it
[1:22:55] he'll fly higher and higher
[1:22:57] if there's none in this valley he'll
[1:23:00] rise a little higher the higher you go
[1:23:03] the more you can see
[1:23:04] so it's time for eagles
[1:23:07] of this day
[1:23:09] to get to flying higher
[1:23:13] amen come on are we reading
[1:23:15] dig into god's promises
[1:23:19] not live on vulture food that's been
[1:23:21] killed years ago
[1:23:26] and live on vulture food
[1:23:28] that's right
[1:23:35] let's make sure we keep this in the
[1:23:36] right respect let's read this one number
[1:23:38] 19.
[1:23:41] showing you we're talking about the new
[1:23:42] birth is what makes you an eagle
[1:23:44] the anointing of the age is what makes
[1:23:46] it the eagle age right all right
[1:23:49] it was born again in luther's age it
[1:23:51] would have been the man's spirit age
[1:23:53] and the new birth that would have been
[1:23:56] leading us
[1:23:57] if we'd been born under the ox we would
[1:23:58] have been learned to sacrifice time and
[1:24:01] that new birth would have led us to give
[1:24:02] our lives for the gospel right
[1:24:05] now what are we supposed to do
[1:24:07] the presbyterian church methodist church
[1:24:09] baptist church any of them can bring
[1:24:11] forth these
[1:24:14] eagles that's your prophet that's not me
[1:24:18] cure is the atmosphere that does it
[1:24:22] as dr bosworth used to say you can take
[1:24:24] a puppy you know and tie it down over an
[1:24:25] egg
[1:24:27] you take an egg you just take a dog and
[1:24:29] tie it down on the eggs it'll hatch him
[1:24:30] eggs
[1:24:33] right it's the atmosphere
[1:24:38] you say well you mean to tell me their
[1:24:40] denominations can produce a birth
[1:24:44] i wish you hadn't thought that
[1:24:47] i'm dirty
[1:24:49] don't mean no god i know but i wish you
[1:24:51] hadn't thought that
[1:24:53] cause a lot of you believe you got the
[1:24:54] new birth before you come to this
[1:24:55] message
[1:24:58] now
[1:25:00] see don't play with me with words
[1:25:04] don't think you can trap somebody that
[1:25:06] knows what they're talking about
[1:25:08] you say you got the new word before you
[1:25:10] come in the message so you had to get a
[1:25:11] new word while you was in a denomination
[1:25:13] somewhere
[1:25:16] you better start believing the
[1:25:18] denominations could produce a birth
[1:25:20] i believe they could i never denied
[1:25:22] yours
[1:25:26] mine's just different i never denied
[1:25:28] yours
[1:25:32] why because
[1:25:34] the atmosphere
[1:25:37] may be getting pretty bad now there i
[1:25:39] don't know if they know my business

[1:25:48] bottom part of it paragraph 7d

[1:25:55] the atmosphere in the heavenly worship
[1:25:57] get the atmosphere right eagles will be
[1:25:59] born
[1:26:01] and out of any church ever
[1:26:05] people don't like that
[1:26:07] because they think the denomination
[1:26:08] can't produce a birthday you better
[1:26:11] better be quiet because see i'll just
[1:26:14] expose that part
[1:26:15] most of the people that believe that
[1:26:17] believe they come out of the
[1:26:18] denomination got the birth before they
[1:26:19] come out of it
[1:26:23] my wife don't like me to make faces on
[1:26:25] them
[1:26:26] on that internet system where they can
[1:26:28] look at you
[1:26:32] come on get that you pop and smoke it
[1:26:33] just a little while
[1:26:35] you're going to either have to tell your
[1:26:36] congregation that you don't have didn't
[1:26:38] have the new birth backer and got it
[1:26:40] later or you better tell them it could
[1:26:42] happen
[1:26:45] come on
[1:26:48] not trying to be nothing but what i am
[1:26:55] okay what are we up to
[1:26:59] go ahead to number 20.
[1:27:06] this is from the easter seal 1965.
[1:27:09] oh god send the holy ghost and look out
[1:27:11] them eagles some word that's ready to
[1:27:14] stand younger no matter what takes place
[1:27:18] that'll soar into the unknown not sit on
[1:27:20] the telephone wires and look for some
[1:27:22] sunday school literature to come in
[1:27:26] now brother i've been having to do no
[1:27:27] problem with sunday school literature he
[1:27:29] had sundays too mr
[1:27:31] what's he talking about
[1:27:34] when you take sunday school and you make
[1:27:36] it just being the only thing that's of
[1:27:38] god you know or i mean just you know you
[1:27:41] you put it out there and just make a
[1:27:43] lot of it
[1:27:44] it's not right okay
[1:27:46] let's do a couple more real quick
[1:27:54] now here comes one that's sticking in my
[1:27:56] face
[1:27:58] number 21. is the rising of the sun
[1:28:02] well you say well now let me tell you
[1:28:04] something
[1:28:05] my pastor i don't care what your pastor
[1:28:08] said
[1:28:09] it's what the word says right
[1:28:12] if you want to be a chicken
[1:28:14] go on with him
[1:28:18] but if the pastor speaks different from
[1:28:20] this word then he's not a feeder of the
[1:28:22] eagles
[1:28:23] uh-huh he's a feeder of the hens see not
[1:28:26] of the eagles eagles eat on eagle's food
[1:28:30] it is quicker
[1:28:33] so determine how what people are saying
[1:28:35] look at this
[1:28:37] next two
[1:28:40] anointed once the end time
[1:28:42] paragraph 2 14
[1:28:45] where the carcass is there the eagles
[1:28:46] will be gathered where the carcass where
[1:28:48] the the killing is dire the eagles will
[1:28:50] be gathered
[1:28:52] whether where the fresh meat is the word
[1:28:54] of the season then the eagles will
[1:28:56] gather but after it's rotten
[1:29:01] what
[1:29:02] then the vultures will swarm to it
[1:29:07] yeah
[1:29:09] see what i mean
[1:29:10] when a kill is made here comes the
[1:29:12] eagles but after it lays there and
[1:29:13] rotten
[1:29:15] then here comes the vultures the eagles
[1:29:17] won't have nothing to do with it
[1:29:19] after it gets rotten's maggots in it
[1:29:21] then here comes the vultures
[1:29:23] they can smell it
[1:29:25] you know
[1:29:27] that's how they go by
[1:29:30] look at the lights when we quit on
[1:29:33] this is paragraph 253
[1:29:36] that's where the true eagles set down to
[1:29:38] eat
[1:29:40] yes sir that's where the true elected
[1:29:42] eagles see what it is
[1:29:46] when he can't take that word they know
[1:29:49] right then he's a denominational
[1:29:51] vulture
[1:29:55] i know this or not be done but i ask you
[1:29:58] another question why did you leave the
[1:30:00] church he was in and come here it
[1:30:01] shouldn't it certainly wasn't for my
[1:30:03] uh you know me doing it to bring you
[1:30:05] here
[1:30:11] why are you traveling about to do it
[1:30:16] the only thing i've ever said to you is
[1:30:18] if you find more words anywhere else you
[1:30:20] let us know where we can go eat
[1:30:22] i said that from the beginning i'm still
[1:30:24] here
[1:30:25] because you let me know where there's
[1:30:26] more word that i'll get the person to
[1:30:27] come here and speak to us
[1:30:31] because i want to eat some fresh meat
[1:30:33] folks
[1:30:34] i like good fresh meat
[1:30:42] why can't he fly
[1:30:44] why can't the vulture fly like a needle
[1:30:47] because look what he's been eating
[1:30:50] he's been eating on rotten
[1:30:51] denominational caring
[1:30:53] now you know
[1:30:55] they're the ones who hear the words
[1:30:57] don't understand us
[1:30:59] brother brown had nothing against the
[1:31:00] people in the churches it was the system
[1:31:03] of the church
[1:31:04] i have nothing against any
[1:31:06] denominational church this is a great
[1:31:08] friend of mine right over here do
[1:31:09] anything in the world for me not with
[1:31:11] him i have no problem with it's the
[1:31:13] system that i'm against amen not the
[1:31:16] people
[1:31:18] i have no trouble with any people in the
[1:31:19] denominational church the poker rome i
[1:31:21] have no trouble with him i ain't gonna
[1:31:23] kiss his ring not sure ain't gonna kiss
[1:31:25] his stuff
[1:31:27] but the thing of it is
[1:31:29] he's a human being
[1:31:33] but i'm against what he teaches
[1:31:36] the system of the thing right
[1:31:39] that's why he can't fly because look
[1:31:40] what he's been eating he's been eating
[1:31:42] them rotten denominational carry
[1:31:44] that that won't spiritualize his body
[1:31:47] won't put him in a spiritual fitness in
[1:31:49] other words he
[1:31:50] in other words to carry him up above the
[1:31:52] denominational difference it won't carry
[1:31:54] him up above it
[1:31:56] he just read on rotten stuff his body is
[1:31:58] made out of that he can't go up there
[1:32:01] where that fresh meat
[1:32:03] carries that eagle he just can't do it
[1:32:07] i said it while they go then
[1:32:09] brother joe gave it to him before came
[1:32:10] out brought around when it's arriving
[1:32:12] the sun said
[1:32:15] the holy spirit coming down to quicken
[1:32:18] make alive those people that's foreign
[1:32:20] ordained of god to be in the rapture
[1:32:22] that is if he is a true equal he will
[1:32:26] understand the message of the hour
[1:32:28] if he's a true equal that's right man
[1:32:32] if he's a true he's right yes sir if
[1:32:34] we're true eagles
[1:32:37] we act like eagles
[1:32:39] right
[1:32:45] we're trying to just be what god made us
[1:32:48] what is the
[1:32:49] spirit of this age equal age
[1:32:52] astronaut age
[1:32:55] beyond all the other ages and things
[1:33:00] an eagle age
[1:33:03] that new birth that you have
[1:33:05] with the anointing of the age that
[1:33:07] you're living under
[1:33:09] and we're eagles
[1:33:11] luther was an eagle
[1:33:12] right
[1:33:13] all they got the new birth is eagles
[1:33:15] right right
[1:33:16] come on
[1:33:18] but this is the age of the eagles to be
[1:33:20] made manifest
[1:33:21] right i hope now you'll go back and look
[1:33:23] at the times that the prophet said
[1:33:25] eagles plural
[1:33:30] and we're definitely i stated again not
[1:33:32] looking for somebody else to come over
[1:33:34] to straighten brother brown
[1:33:41] they've tried to put me in every camp
[1:33:42] since i've been in this message and they
[1:33:44] just couldn't fit anymore
[1:33:47] and that's
[1:33:48] it just don't work
[1:33:51] why
[1:33:54] because i want the true food feed don't
[1:33:56] you i want to true me to the other
[1:33:58] message
[1:33:59] i'm not satisfied with just going to
[1:34:01] church and being good
[1:34:02] and doing good works and deeds
[1:34:06] you know helping the widows the orphans
[1:34:08] and the missionaries and the printing of
[1:34:10] the books and the thing
[1:34:12] and we do everything we can
[1:34:20] but i like a good steakhouse
[1:34:25] now if you want a good steak you get
[1:34:26] zachary
[1:34:30] you can take an old piece of slab meat
[1:34:32] and make it taste good
[1:34:35] because he could good steak
[1:34:42] i don't mind paying for one
[1:34:45] but i hate to pay the price of them and
[1:34:47] it come out to be so grisly and all kind
[1:34:50] of things in it and it's so tough you
[1:34:51] can't eat it
[1:34:53] i like a good piece of meat it cooks
[1:34:55] just right
[1:34:58] something you can lick your chops on as
[1:35:00] you thought
[1:35:02] like a brother said he was going hunting
[1:35:04] one time he said you eat this steak
[1:35:06] tonight he said you won't be hungry in
[1:35:07] the morning
[1:35:08] he said that'll take care of you i said
[1:35:11] give me two books
[1:35:12] and
[1:35:16] but you see
[1:35:17] eagles won't fresh me amen
[1:35:27] vultures and things is satisfied with
[1:35:29] tail stuff
[1:35:34] now i've never made these statements
[1:35:36] like a lot of people's made you know
[1:35:38] that we need to get brother branham off
[1:35:40] the scene i don't go along with all
[1:35:42] those statements
[1:35:44] a lot of preachers in this message said
[1:35:46] we need to get brother round them off
[1:35:47] the scene where we can go on i don't
[1:35:49] agree with that
[1:35:51] because there's people just now
[1:35:52] beginning to hear the message so you
[1:35:54] can't get him off the scene
[1:35:57] you got to keep the messenger here
[1:35:59] bringing the message to those that are
[1:36:00] just getting the message
[1:36:04] but i do say one thing and i've always
[1:36:06] said it
[1:36:12] i want something fresh every day
[1:36:16] and i pray lord
[1:36:18] give me this day my daily bread
[1:36:25] my wife's even said why do you travel to
[1:36:27] a lot of places and go
[1:36:30] knowing that they're not preaching very
[1:36:31] much
[1:36:32] i said i go pray
[1:36:35] and i pray for one crumb
[1:36:40] if that's all i get
[1:36:42] you tell me you went to walmart and got
[1:36:44] something different
[1:36:47] and you know what i mean by that you
[1:36:48] tell me you just went to where you went
[1:36:52] and didn't go
[1:36:53] to eat
[1:36:56] then i'll just take my little piece of
[1:36:58] meat that i get
[1:37:01] might be called wrong for doing a lot of
[1:37:03] things but i'll just take my little
[1:37:05] piece of meat
[1:37:07] and you know what i'm looking for
[1:37:11] you know eagles don't like to buddy with
[1:37:12] other birds
[1:37:19] you don't see vultures and eagles
[1:37:20] buddying together
[1:37:28] if i have to walk along and walk alone
[1:37:32] i ain't worried about it because it's
[1:37:34] always been eagles if god sent along to
[1:37:36] believe the word that's right
[1:37:38] i believe it's just time that we start
[1:37:40] flapping our wings
[1:37:42] right raising up a little bit and
[1:37:43] soaring on
[1:37:45] getting to the place that we can
[1:37:47] understand
[1:37:48] you remember brother random about that
[1:37:50] eagle said it was sitting there
[1:37:52] he said so he spoke to and said don't
[1:37:54] you know eagle that i could get my gun
[1:37:56] and shoot you he said that eagle
[1:37:57] wouldn't work at all he said he knew
[1:37:59] before i could get my gun and pull it he
[1:38:02] said he'd be gone in them trees
[1:38:05] he's learning how to trust
[1:38:10] learning how to walk
[1:38:12] let's stand come on musicians
[1:38:15] eagle age
[1:38:18] waiting for the eagles to come
[1:38:21] there was no need of bringing an evil
[1:38:23] message if it wasn't going to be eagles
[1:38:25] to be able to eat the
[1:38:28] food you see what the trouble is then
[1:38:31] don't you
[1:38:33] now what a lot of people tried to do
[1:38:34] with the message they took it and light
[1:38:36] it up and let it get stale and then they
[1:38:38] can come back weeks or months later
[1:38:40] after it's rotten and they can be like
[1:38:41] vultures and they can just pick out what
[1:38:44] they want to and
[1:38:45] you know i believe the two souls the 700
[1:38:47] words are crucial
[1:38:52] the true eagle amen
[1:38:55] he just wants true feet
[1:39:00] eagle age
[1:39:01] i preached this 40 years ago so it's no
[1:39:03] problem for you to think that i'm trying
[1:39:05] to no i'm trying to tell you the truth
[1:39:09] we need to just realize who we are and
[1:39:11] start flapping our wings
[1:39:14] down in the yard our house went down
[1:39:16] these hawks used to
[1:39:18] to raise little ones up above us there
[1:39:19] before terrorists put his house up there
[1:39:23] and they'd raise the little ones we'd
[1:39:24] see him every once in a while in that
[1:39:26] valley out in the front there you know
[1:39:28] one day i was out there and i saw that
[1:39:29] little one that he come oh he was just
[1:39:31] boy he was you could tell he was just he
[1:39:33] would have him a ball and it's probably
[1:39:35] maybe first time out nest he was just
[1:39:37] flopping and mama was over in one place
[1:39:39] and daddy's over the other one and they
[1:39:41] were just soaring around you know just
[1:39:43] like happening
[1:39:44] but here he was
[1:39:47] glory hallelujah he was shouting
[1:39:50] about that time he hit a wind
[1:39:54] and he got in that wind and that little
[1:39:56] fella didn't know how to get out of it
[1:40:00] and he went from here to there in just a
[1:40:02] hurry
[1:40:04] because he didn't know how to get out of
[1:40:05] the wind
[1:40:06] but about the time that he got nearly
[1:40:08] out where i couldn't see him i heard two
[1:40:11] screens
[1:40:15] and i looked
[1:40:16] here they come
[1:40:20] and when i
[1:40:23] they got their little fella
[1:40:27] because they knew what to do
[1:40:30] god can take care of us right let's go
[1:40:32] ahead what we got standing somewhere in
[1:40:34] the shadows
[1:40:36] you might have a needle somewhere
[1:40:40] in the shadows you'll find
[1:40:48] jesus one
[1:40:51] who cares
[1:40:57] standing somewhere
[1:41:01] in the shadows

[1:42:12] start flying a little bit and i'm sure
[1:42:14] he'll come out crying
[1:42:17] and having a good time
[1:42:19] but let's just pray everything we'll be
[1:42:20] all right
[1:42:23] because they're going to have to end
[1:42:24] this life we're going to have to do
