[4:24] on my mother-in-law so let's let let's
[4:26] read uh 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse
[4:29] starting at verse one it says therefore
[4:31] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[4:34] received the mercy we faint not but we
[4:37] have renounced the hidden things of
[4:41] dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor
[4:44] handling the word of God
[4:46] deceitfully but by
[4:48] manifestation amen of the truth
[4:51] commending ourselves to Every Man's
[4:53] conscience in the sight of God that's
[4:56] right but if our gospel be hid it is hid
[4:59] to them that are lost in whom the God of
[5:02] this world hath blinded the minds of
[5:05] them which believe not we know that's
[5:07] Satan right lest the light of the
[5:09] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[5:12] image of God should shine unto them for
[5:16] we preach not
[5:18] ourselves very um very different from
[5:22] many people that's what they that's how
[5:23] they do preach themselves for we preach
[5:26] not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord
[5:29] am and ourselves your servants for
[5:31] jesus' sake that's what a minister is
[5:34] he's a servant amen verse six for God
[5:38] who commanded the light to shine out of
[5:42] Darkness hath shined in our hearts to
[5:45] give the light of the knowledge of the
[5:46] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[5:50] look at verse seven but we have this
[5:53] treasure in other words this light we
[5:55] have this treasure in Earth and
[5:58] vessels am amen think about that think
[6:00] how powerful that is Saints we have this
[6:03] treasure in Earth and vessels that the
[6:05] Excellency of the power may be of God
[6:09] Amen and not of us praise God that's
[6:12] right we are troubled on every side yet
[6:14] not distressed we are perplexed but not
[6:16] in despair am persecuted but not
[6:19] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[6:22] always bearing about in the body the
[6:24] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[6:26] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[6:29] our body
[6:30] hallelujah amen let's just go to the
[6:31] Lord in prayer our heavenly father we
[6:34] thank you Lord for this opportunity that

[7:03] me to say father God only the things
[7:04] that you'd want me to say Lord anoint my
[7:06] lips Lord God and prevent me from saying
[7:09] anything Lord that I shouldn't father

[7:12] ourselves into your hands now in the
[7:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[7:17] praise the Lord you may be seated
[7:20] tonight praise
[7:23] God Amen I um again it's good to be in
[7:27] the house of the Lord um
[7:29] um I call the I
[7:33] call if it's possible
[7:35] yeah I call uh I call the house of the
[7:38] Lord God's Filling Station amen that's
[7:41] right because it is amen that's right
[7:43] amen every every midweek no Sunday but
[7:47] if you're a gy if you're a car that
[7:49] guzzles up a lot of gas amen Wednesday
[7:53] and Sunday shouldn't be the only time
[7:54] you filling up that's right amen you
[7:57] should be filling up in between now I I
[8:00] take it for example if like if you're um
[8:02] you know if you're driving and I've been
[8:04] in this situation before we've taken
[8:05] long drives to Canada before and the
[8:08] hard-headed hardheadedness that I that I
[8:10] have amen sometimes my wife tells me you
[8:13] need to go fill up I said no we have a
[8:14] little bit more to go I just don't want
[8:16] to get out of the car yet you know but
[8:18] then all of a sudden that needle shows
[8:20] empty and you're wondering I'm like Lord
[8:23] where I need some I need some gasoline
[8:25] Lord help me to be able to get to the
[8:27] next gas station and finally you see
[8:29] that bright light that
[8:31] QT up in the distance amen you know and
[8:34] to me that's like the bright light amen
[8:37] when you come and you want to hear his
[8:39] word you see that bright light spend
[8:40] that quality time that QT with him amen
[8:44] praise God because that and then what
[8:45] happens when you go in there once you
[8:47] once you see that QT you you don't even
[8:49] have the gas yet pumped and you already
[8:51] feel relieved cuz you know you're going
[8:54] to be able to make it amen so you go in
[8:56] there you not just get gas but you also
[8:58] go ahead and get some some potato chips
[9:00] some chocolate some sodas whatever so
[9:02] that you can keep going on the road amen
[9:04] and that's the same thing with the house
[9:05] of the Lord Saints amen you get you get
[9:07] what you need amen and you get also the
[9:09] little extras the fellowship with the
[9:10] brother and the sister amen prayer
[9:13] anything amen God has in store for you
[9:15] amen only if you want it that's right
[9:17] otherwise you're going to be on left on
[9:18] the side of the road without no gas
[9:20] that's right and I'm afraid that's how a
[9:23] lot of people have become amen thank you
[9:25] brother
[9:27] B stuck on the side the road with no gas
[9:30] when God has already given us so much in
[9:31] this hour we have no excuse Saints
[9:34] praise God Amen so uh real quickly I
[9:37] just want to give you an update on my my
[9:39] mother-in-law I know that you all have
[9:41] been praying for her she's doing she's
[9:43] doing very good and um she's on her
[9:47] third round of chemo or getting ready to
[9:49] start her third round of
[9:50] chemotherapy um because of the cancer
[9:53] that that she had but she's expected to
[9:56] um have her um uterus is it the uterus
[10:01] and bladder removed in July because the
[10:04] cancer is in those areas but we're
[10:07] praying that the Lord amen that that
[10:09] that don't has that doesn't have to be
[10:11] done so um but she's been she's been
[10:13] she's been uh very you know even though
[10:15] she's in Canada she's a woman of Faith
[10:18] amen and uh she uh she acts like
[10:21] nothing's wrong with
[10:23] her and that's what she she she she's a
[10:26] Believer and uh so she just so we just
[10:29] we just uh just ask that you continue to
[10:31] pray for her and that uh as she's
[10:33] getting ready to go to this third round
[10:34] of chemo and U I know like brother Benny
[10:37] you know we've been praying for him and
[10:39] he's I guess he's he's deciding on what
[10:41] he's going to do in in that regards but
[10:43] let me tell you my my my mother-in-law
[10:45] she's gone through this chemo and she
[10:47] said she hasn't been feeling any side
[10:49] effects or anything so we just thank God
[10:51] for that amen and uh I believe God can
[10:54] take care of his own amen so um if that
[10:58] brings any encouragement Amen to maybe
[11:00] brother Benny or anybody else that may
[11:02] need it amen God is God is able to take
[11:04] care of his own amen so we just
[11:06] appreciate the
[11:08] Lord amen well tonight um amen was we're
[11:11] reading here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4
[11:14] um I'm going to talk tonight a little
[11:16] topic about why God only wants losers in
[11:19] his
[11:22] army he he only wants losers in his army
[11:26] amen amen he doesn't want winners now
[11:28] that's kind contr to the way the world
[11:30] thinks about it amen but what he wants
[11:32] is losers in his army and let's read
[11:34] about why amen praise God if we continue
[11:37] reading here going back to verse six
[11:39] amen it says for God who commanded the
[11:42] light to shine out of Darkness amen when
[11:44] God Amen at the beginning said let there
[11:46] be light and out of Darkness amen he
[11:49] created he created something out of
[11:51] nothing when he said let there be light
[11:54] and there was light and you and me were
[11:56] walking in darkness at one point in time
[11:58] amen amen and out of dark darkness amen
[12:01] God was able to make something out of us
[12:03] right now it's been it's been him
[12:05] because it hasn't been you and me praise
[12:08] God like I said before amen you and me
[12:10] just wanted to be out living in the
[12:12] world drinking smoking gambling hanging
[12:15] around with the wrong crowd and doing
[12:16] all these things in darkness but God yet
[12:20] amen out of his mercy and his grace he
[12:22] still calls us out amen until his
[12:24] glorious light praise God and I
[12:26] appreciate his grace to us amen right
[12:30] for hath the light to shine out of
[12:32] Darkness hath shined in our hearts to
[12:34] give the light of the knowledge of the
[12:36] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[12:38] what a privilege for us Saints in this
[12:40] hour to know amen the things that we
[12:43] know and not just to know them but to be
[12:45] able to live them amen through the Holy
[12:48] Spirit praise God I have Jehovah's
[12:50] Witnesses that come to my house and I
[12:53] thought that I had left them in Anderson
[12:54] South Carolina but now they're visiting
[12:56] in Georgia
[12:57] too
[13:00] but that's okay it just gives me an
[13:02] opportunity to say speak the gospel to
[13:04] them you know and uh I had some a couple
[13:07] came the other day and uh and uh you
[13:10] know they they I let them speak I let
[13:12] them say what they want to say you know
[13:14] and then they give me some time to speak
[13:16] you know but then you know you perplex
[13:19] them with things like baptism in the
[13:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't
[13:22] really like to deal with Jehovah's
[13:23] Witness in any other way but about Jesus
[13:27] being God Amen because that that
[13:29] stumbles them right there and they just
[13:31] can't accept it you know and so that's I
[13:34] asked them I said well how do you how
[13:36] are you baptized I said in the name of
[13:38] the father Son and Holy Ghost and I went
[13:39] through explaining name baptism of the
[13:42] Lord Jesus Christ and they just rattled
[13:44] their heads you know and they said well
[13:47] um if you we come back again next time
[13:49] amen you could you have could you have
[13:51] some of those scriptures written out
[13:52] first I said sure enough amen but it
[13:56] makes me think it makes me wonder you
[13:57] know at one point in time you know we
[13:59] were we were in that in in that way amen
[14:02] and and they're they're being they're
[14:03] sincere in what they're doing they're
[14:06] just ins sincere and almost more sincere
[14:08] than what you and me are amen when we
[14:10] have this glorious light amen that God
[14:13] has shined on us and they're more
[14:15] sincere than we are amen about the truth
[14:17] that's right brother amen so it it makes
[14:19] you think amen puts us to shame
[14:21] sometimes it should put us to
[14:24] shame verse 7 it says here but we have
[14:27] this treasure in Earth and vessels God
[14:30] chose amen this treasure to be placed in
[14:35] you and me that's right why didn't he
[14:37] choose the the the great giraffe or the
[14:40] great lion or the Tiger or the these
[14:42] great animals that God created but he
[14:44] decided to put it in you and me this
[14:47] treasure amen now I like the way Paul
[14:49] words are here am man because he's
[14:51] talking about well well he says here
[14:53] that the Excellency of the power may be
[14:55] of God and not of us that's right so
[14:57] everything that God does in our lives is
[14:59] for his Ben for his glory amen right to
[15:03] be able to use you amen am that's for
[15:05] his glory and it's not for your own
[15:07] Glory it's so easy for us say to get
[15:10] caught up with me me me me me and my my
[15:13] my my my and it's all about me and what
[15:15] I can do and what I and and nobody else
[15:17] can do it like me and that's wrong
[15:20] Sint in this a in this day and age we
[15:23] are so infatuated with with with um with
[15:27] self-centeredness yeah everything is
[15:29] about me me me that's the reason why you
[15:31] call the the the phone iPhone and it's
[15:35] you uh you know uh Myspace and uh all
[15:38] these different things it's all about me
[15:40] me me me me and and and what I can get
[15:42] out of it right and every that's why
[15:44] people when you're walking around with
[15:45] their iPhones and don't care about
[15:47] anybody else but it's just about me me
[15:50] me and then you take and then the selfie
[15:54] people taking selfies and they it's got
[15:57] to where they actually had to put that
[15:59] word in the dictionary now because
[16:01] everybody's just with a selfie now you
[16:03] know selfie this selfie that why and
[16:06] that word actually comes out of the word
[16:09] selfish so that's that's the age that
[16:12] we're living in Saints and if you're not
[16:13] careful we get caught up in that and and
[16:15] and and and you know we're and and we're
[16:18] wonder you know other people are looking
[16:20] and needing help amen along the way and
[16:22] and you're you're just worried about
[16:24] yourself amen
[16:26] now I don't even know where I was going
[16:28] with that but but we have this treasure
[16:31] in Earth and vessels so that God can get
[16:32] the glory now I like what Paul uses if
[16:36] you look at that word Earth and vessels
[16:37] in verse seven there it refers to
[16:40] ordinary earth andwar right in other
[16:42] words uh uh clay pots that were used by
[16:45] Common People to store valuables or to
[16:49] store things oil and things like that
[16:52] that that was there was a value right
[16:54] yet they used Earth and vessels just
[16:57] regular common
[16:59] Earth and vessels to store these things
[17:01] in so in other words you sisters amen
[17:03] when you go to to um to the Garden
[17:06] Center at Lowe's or to Home
[17:08] Depot or Walmart you go look for and you
[17:12] have this plant you want to plant you go
[17:14] look for an earth and vessel maybe a
[17:17] brown pot to be able to put your your
[17:19] plant in so that way because it's
[17:22] precious to you and you want to take
[17:23] care of it that way it can grow Amen in
[17:26] a in a pretty Earth and vessel amen
[17:29] but now if you want to save some money
[17:31] you go to Walmart and you buy the cheap
[17:34] pot but it's still going to have the
[17:36] same effect you know the plant's still
[17:38] going to grow you see and that's what
[17:40] that's what Paul is talking about God's
[17:42] used take uh takes us as Earth and
[17:45] vessels but that's what he's decided
[17:47] Amen to have something beautiful grow
[17:49] out of Amen regular clay we're not we're
[17:53] not jars from the Ming Dynasty or
[17:55] nothing like that amen we're just
[17:57] regular common Walmart pots amen but
[18:00] that's what God decided to use Amen in
[18:02] this day amen to get his get Glory out
[18:05] of that amen that's why he used a man by
[18:08] the name of William brandham in this day
[18:10] regular common Joe seventh grader right
[18:14] no no offense brother Joe seventh grade
[18:17] education Amen to bring forth the word
[18:20] amen in this our day that's what he
[18:22] wants and that's how he likes it and
[18:23] that's and and that's how he gets the
[18:25] glory amen amen because if if if he
[18:28] chose the greatest intellectual the
[18:31] biggest man in of the hour and
[18:33] everything like that he could be able to
[18:36] say well I did it amen and God doesn't
[18:39] want that amen that's right amen God
[18:41] wants us Amen to be a to be a base amen
[18:43] remember God wants losers in his army
[18:46] and we'll go here we'll get there in
[18:47] just a moment amen praise the Lord so
[18:51] cuz we're nothing but dust made out of
[18:53] the same clay
[18:54] Saints you know there we some of us are
[18:57] taller than others some some of us are
[18:58] short some of us are are a little bit
[19:00] more rounder than others and but brother
[19:03] brandham said what our bodies are are
[19:06] we're worth only about 84 cents and some
[19:08] of us that're a little bit more round
[19:10] they're probably worth 80 89 cents
[19:13] maybe you know but but you know we're
[19:17] we're nothing Saints right we're nothing
[19:20] to be able to think that we could we can
[19:22] we can act like like like we're
[19:24] something and and that the world owes
[19:26] everything to us Saints amen
[19:28] and God can't use a vessel like that God
[19:31] can't use somebody like that exactly
[19:34] right amen some of us dressed up a
[19:35] little bit better some of us look a
[19:37] little stronger amen some of us last a
[19:39] little longer but in the end we all go
[19:41] back to the same
[19:43] place amen but if the Holy Ghost is
[19:46] dwelling within amen it doesn't
[19:49] matter amen praise God so and these
[19:54] Earth and vessels amen that's what God
[19:56] desires to hide his treasures
[19:58] in amen the world goes out here and
[20:02] we're we're just regular people amongst
[20:04] the world but they don't understand that
[20:06] if the Holy Ghost is dwelling within
[20:08] amen you and I amen we're powerful
[20:10] people s but that power that we have is
[20:14] actually should abase us amen should
[20:16] make us humble and not not hotty amen
[20:19] not hottie because then God can't use us
[20:22] God can't use us at all there was a show
[20:25] one time called the Antiques Road Show
[20:28] now I've never watched it but uh what it
[20:32] was about was that these people they
[20:34] would take like these these uh you know
[20:36] like a regular chair or something and
[20:38] they take it to some sort of Judge who
[20:40] knows about the history of different
[20:42] Antiques and things like that and they
[20:44] would they would he would look at it and
[20:46] it'd be just a some chair that they had
[20:48] sitting in a in a basement thought maybe
[20:51] it wouldn't worth anything but when they
[20:53] come to to to to the front of the person
[20:55] and they see it and they say wow this
[20:57] thing's worth worth $200 it's from such
[21:00] and such an age and it was made by such
[21:02] and such a person amen and who would
[21:04] have thought and so the person comes out
[21:06] they're winning 200 300 $5,000 $30,000
[21:10] for something they thought it was of no
[21:12] value right amen so that that's what and
[21:15] you're valuable Amen in the eyes of God
[21:18] Sint you have some value young people
[21:20] amen you have value in the eyes of God
[21:23] right don't let the world deteriorate
[21:25] the value that you have amen before God
[21:28] amen you're valuable in this hours and
[21:31] God has a plan for you and for you amen
[21:34] that's right you may not know it right
[21:35] now but God has something in store for
[21:37] you for you to do Amen to bring him
[21:40] glory amen praise the Lord I want you to
[21:44] read with me in in the 1 Corinthians
[21:47] chapter
[21:49] 1 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and just bear
[21:52] with me this is a little lengthy but I
[21:54] think it it goes well with what we're
[21:57] we're talking about about here what Paul
[22:00] says because you know Saints Paul had
[22:02] some had a lot to Glory about you know
[22:06] he was he was Pharisee of the Pharisees
[22:09] and you couldn't put a finger in his
[22:11] life but yet he had to give all that up
[22:14] Amen to become one of these Earth and
[22:16] vessels for Christ amen all those things
[22:18] became it he said it became as dung to
[22:21] him amen well one I can't think of
[22:24] anything else lower than than dun Amen
[22:27] to be to be able to use by Christ verse
[22:30] 17 it says in 1 Corinthians 1 says for
[22:34] Christ sent me not to baptize but to
[22:36] preach the gospel not with wisdom of
[22:39] words lest the Cross of Christ should be
[22:41] made of none
[22:44] effect amen for the preaching of the
[22:47] Cross is to them that perish foolishness
[22:50] so in other words to them there are uh
[22:52] uh that have not believed it's it's
[22:54] foolish to the world when you preach the
[22:56] cross right but unto us which are saved
[22:59] it is the power of God Amen for it is
[23:03] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[23:05] wise and will bring nothing the
[23:07] understanding of the prudent so God is
[23:09] not saying that the world does not have
[23:12] some sort of wisdom or some sort of
[23:14] understanding they do have some sort of
[23:15] wisdom understand but it's not the
[23:17] wisdom of God and it's not the
[23:19] understanding of God which only can come
[23:21] through the Holy Ghost
[23:23] amen for it is written I will destroy
[23:25] the wisdom of the wise and will bring to
[23:27] nothing the understanding of The Prudent
[23:29] where is the wise where is the Scribe
[23:32] where is the disputer of this world hath
[23:34] not God made foolish the wisdom of this
[23:38] world Amen they think that they think
[23:40] they have it all figured out but I was
[23:42] telling the other day uh
[23:44] somebody you know they've come out
[23:46] because uh there's there's a documentary
[23:48] about how the uh uh about the Red Sea
[23:51] Crossing and how where where they
[23:52] crossed and there's actually uh they
[23:54] found chariot wheels in that specific
[23:56] area and things like that even bones and
[23:59] fragments of what may be the Egyptians
[24:01] that had that had fallen in there and it
[24:04] it it took like a a technology to be
[24:07] able to gather those things and to find
[24:09] you know aerial views and and
[24:11] photographs and things like that and I
[24:13] was telling the brother I said you know
[24:14] they take this technology that they have
[24:16] invented Amen to try to uh uh you know
[24:20] disprove God and yet with it they Pro
[24:22] they're proving they're proving the
[24:23] Bible correct God just takes it and
[24:26] turns it around on them with the same
[24:28] technology from the from the knowledge
[24:30] tree that they're that they're they're
[24:31] Gathering From so there's knowledge
[24:33] there and they have some sort of wisdom
[24:35] to build this things but God uses those
[24:37] things to Amen to prove his word amen is
[24:40] real it's
[24:42] true where we we here verse 20 verse 21
[24:46] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[24:48] World by wisdom knew not God it pleased
[24:50] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[24:52] save them that
[24:54] believe so somebody up here slobbering
[24:57] and and and and telling you to repent
[24:59] that's what God decided to use Amen in
[25:03] order to bring forth his word amen for
[25:05] after that see by the foolishness of
[25:08] preaches save them that believe for the
[25:10] Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek
[25:13] after
[25:14] wisdom but we preach Christ crucified
[25:19] unto uh we preach Christ crucified unto
[25:22] the Jews a stumbling block and unto the
[25:25] Greeks
[25:26] foolishness Greeks being you and me but
[25:29] unto them which are called both Jews and
[25:31] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[25:34] wisdom of God
[25:37] because because the foolishness of God
[25:39] is wiser than man and the weakness of
[25:41] God is stronger than man right so if God
[25:43] had weakness if God had had
[25:47] foolishness that foolishness and that
[25:49] weakness would be stronger than the
[25:50] foolishness and the weakness of of man I
[25:53] like that
[25:55] Saints so you and me have nothing to
[25:57] glory in ourselves
[25:59] Saints cuz all this thing is all these
[26:01] things out here are going to come to not
[26:04] for ye see your calling Brethren how
[26:06] that not many wise men after the
[26:09] flesh um not many mighty not many noble
[26:13] are called but God hath chosen the
[26:15] foolish things of the world to confound
[26:18] the wise and God had chosen the weak
[26:20] things of the world to confound the
[26:23] things which are Mighty right amen amen
[26:26] yes just think about the the the
[26:28] ministry of brother
[26:30] Brandon and base things of the world and
[26:33] things which are despised hath God
[26:36] chosen yay and things which are not to
[26:38] bring to not things that are amen that
[26:42] no flesh should glory in his
[26:45] presence amen this is not about you
[26:47] Saints it's about or or me it's about
[26:50] him amen but of him are ye in Christ
[26:54] Jesus who of God has made us unto us
[26:56] wisdom and righteousness and
[26:58] sanctification and Redemption that
[27:00] according as it is written he that
[27:01] glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen
[27:05] that's what it all boils down to that's
[27:07] Amen Let Him Glory in the Lord right
[27:10] thank you Lord now in Matthew chapter 16
[27:12] and this is where I get my title message
[27:14] Matthew 16: 24 says Jesus speaking he
[27:18] said then said Jesus unto his disciples
[27:21] if any if any man will come after me let
[27:24] him deny himself and take up his cross
[27:28] and follow me amen verse 25 says for
[27:30] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[27:34] it other words you try to live for
[27:37] yourself you try to save your own life
[27:40] or you know the you know save and live
[27:43] for yourself you're going to lose it at
[27:45] the End Amen when you think it's about
[27:47] you and whosoever will lose his life for
[27:50] my sake shall find it amen amen so we
[27:55] want to be losers tonight amen yes sir
[27:58] well I want to be a loser amen you know
[28:00] when I was in high school they used to
[28:02] they used to go around uh I don't know
[28:04] if they do it now but I used to go
[28:06] around holding up a a symbol like this
[28:08] and talking about man you're nothing but
[28:09] a loser
[28:11] man
[28:13] loser and I remember that and and and
[28:16] and I'm like man I don't want to be
[28:17] called a loser so what I try to fit in
[28:20] dress in and and and make sure I do the
[28:23] things that they were doing am man so I
[28:25] don't be called No loser I don't want
[28:26] nobody wants to be a loser who wants to
[28:29] be a loser who wants to not not win amen
[28:32] when you're playing basketball or when
[28:34] you're doing these things or maybe at
[28:36] work and you're trying to get that
[28:37] promotion or whatever you don't want to
[28:39] you don't come out losing none of us
[28:41] like to lose right amen but in this case
[28:45] we want to be
[28:46] losers sir in this case we want to lose
[28:49] in order to win amen because that was
[28:52] this that was the testimony that Jesus
[28:54] gave when he was here on Earth right
[28:56] right he got to the the point where he
[28:58] said father forgive them for they know
[28:59] not what they do right and he himself
[29:02] said that do you know he told pilot he
[29:04] said do you know that I could call uh
[29:07] angels and they they would come come and
[29:08] res and rescue me but he didn't do it he
[29:11] didn't use his power for his benefit
[29:13] amen he used his power to glorify the
[29:16] father amen do we do we use the our the
[29:20] power that God has given us through the
[29:21] Holy Spirit to glorify
[29:23] him and so many people in this hour they
[29:26] you you they try it's all about them and
[29:28] it's all about me and it's all about
[29:30] right about uh uh my Ministry and and
[29:34] when when reality it's the ministry of
[29:36] the bride of Christ not the ministry of
[29:39] just one man it's the ministry of the
[29:40] bride of Christ in this hour amen it's a
[29:43] many it's a it's God's working in a many
[29:45] member body so you have an important
[29:47] role you have an important role you have
[29:50] an important role you have an important
[29:52] role each and every one of us has a role
[29:54] to play amen and I told I told uh the
[29:57] Sunday school class before I I told him
[29:59] I said you know each one of us has gifts
[30:02] in our life that God has
[30:04] placed and we have to know how to use
[30:07] those gifts amen and we have to
[30:09] recognize the gifts that God give us but
[30:11] now when you have an apple tree that's
[30:12] growing out here or some form or some
[30:14] tree the apples that grow on that tree
[30:17] those apples are not for the tree to
[30:19] enjoy right those apples are for you and
[30:22] me to
[30:24] enjoy those fruits of the tree are for
[30:26] you and I to enjoy from those the
[30:29] benefits of those fruit not for you and
[30:31] not for you so that's the same thing
[30:33] with the gifts that God has given us is
[30:35] for other people to enjoy to benefit off
[30:37] of them not for you to benefit or to
[30:40] glor glory in what you can do amen about
[30:43] me me me me right no it's all about him
[30:46] Saints cuz he was the one who gave it to
[30:49] you yes sir amen it's not you didn't you
[30:52] didn't get it
[30:54] yourself and if you look at brother
[30:56] bram's life he could have used that gift
[30:58] for for for his own gain but he knew it
[31:02] wasn't his gift it was it was God's Gift
[31:06] amen praise God now if you look at that
[31:09] word lose in the Greek Lexicon it's very
[31:12] interesting it's the word
[31:15] apy and it is it means to perish to uh
[31:21] destroy to lose to be
[31:24] lost says here to destroy to put out of
[31:27] the way entirely yeah entirely to
[31:31] abolish to put an end to ruin to render
[31:36] useless amen can you render yourself
[31:38] useless so that God can use you Amen to
[31:41] kill to declare that one must be put to
[31:44] death to devote or give over to Eternal
[31:49] misery ah so that's what Jesus was
[31:54] talking about yeah amen if you lose your
[31:56] life
[31:57] then you will gain it amen but if you
[32:01] try to gain your life in this life amen
[32:03] you're going to lose it at the
[32:05] end some people in this in this world
[32:08] they they they're so caught up with just
[32:10] making money money money money and I
[32:12] need to make certain millions of dollars
[32:14] before I get to this certain age and I
[32:16] need to get to this point this point and
[32:18] then they lost the purpose of what
[32:20] they're living life
[32:21] for they lost the purpose and at the end
[32:25] they may have gotten all the money in
[32:26] the world but they've lost their
[32:30] soul young people you may have gained
[32:33] all the friends in the world you may
[32:34] have gained all the popularity in the
[32:36] world you may have gained all these all
[32:38] these things of the world and then at
[32:40] the end you end up losing your
[32:42] soul for some friend or some some some
[32:48] popularity you know all the friends that
[32:50] I used to have and I try that I try to
[32:53] act cool in front and try to smoke
[32:55] cigarettes in front of and stuff like
[32:56] that
[32:57] they're not anywhere anywhere be near me
[32:59] anywhere I don't know where they're at
[33:02] now and they probably don't even want to
[33:04] know anything about
[33:05] me you know and that's just how it is
[33:08] it's just a temporal pleasure for just
[33:11] just a moment am so that you can feel
[33:13] good for just a moment but that's not
[33:14] going to last forever amen what matters
[33:17] is what you do for God and what you do
[33:20] and you feed feeding your soul
[33:22] amen so uh God prefers losers amen
[33:26] because he prefers people who can who
[33:28] can recognize their weaknesses amen who
[33:31] can recognize that they need more of him
[33:34] that's the reason why God need wants
[33:36] losers in his army amen and we're in his
[33:38] army amen we're all battling and we're
[33:41] all this is not a picnic amen but God
[33:44] wants us Amen to give ourselves holy to
[33:46] him
[33:48] amen because he wants people to cry out
[33:51] to him amen he wants people to to to
[33:54] deny themselves amen so that they can
[33:56] gain more of
[33:57] him now in 2 Corinthians
[34:01] 4:1 and this ties directly uh or this
[34:05] verse right here ties directly to 2
[34:07] Corinthians 4:10 it says always bearing
[34:09] about in the body of the dying uh the
[34:12] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[34:15] the life also of Jesus might be made
[34:17] manifest in our body amen right so day
[34:21] by day that's the reason why take up
[34:23] your he said take up your cross and
[34:25] follow me right amen Paul said I Die
[34:27] daily amen amen why so that the the the
[34:32] the the the the glory of Jesus Christ
[34:34] may be able to to to dwell amen and to
[34:37] reflect on the outside Amen in front of
[34:39] this world who what they really want to
[34:41] see is a is is is Jesus Christ but they
[34:44] could they don't see it anywhere else
[34:45] that's right you and me have the
[34:47] opportunity to show them Jesus Christ
[34:49] amen cuz they find it and they try to
[34:52] look and and and everybody is pretending
[34:54] that they're living for Jesus Christ
[34:56] everybody out here is pretending to show
[34:59] them what Jesus Christ is about and
[35:01] they're not really satisfied with that
[35:02] they want to see the true Jesus Christ
[35:05] and you and me have the opportunity to
[35:07] show that to them saints amen so always
[35:11] bearing about in the body the D in the
[35:13] Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus
[35:15] might be made manifest in our body I
[35:18] trust that that's your desire amen amen
[35:21] that you want the life of Jesus Christ
[35:23] to always be manifested not just in you
[35:27] but outside amen because what's out in
[35:30] in you amen will manifest on the outside
[35:33] right whatever's in you it's going to
[35:35] come out some way or another you might
[35:37] be hiding it for a little while but
[35:39] eventually it'll come out God will put
[35:42] you in some sort of situation that
[35:44] you'll show your true colors say Jonas
[35:47] uh I mean not Jonas but the um
[35:50] um the the
[35:52] the the the disciple that killed himself
[35:55] that that Judas Judas he eventually
[35:58] showed his true colors
[36:01] right he eventually showed what was in
[36:04] himly although he could cast out devils
[36:06] and heal the sick and and do all these
[36:08] things that God that Jesus had given
[36:11] them power to do right right and that
[36:13] power that he gave him was was was to do
[36:16] all these things but he couldn't they
[36:18] could he could not receive the the
[36:20] damous power which is the power amen
[36:23] that that that that that changes you
[36:25] from the inside out amen
[36:27] that's right he only had the uh the uh I
[36:29] forgot the other power that that that
[36:32] was there but it's the Greek word he
[36:34] only had the power to just do external
[36:36] things but he didn't have the power Amen
[36:38] to change from the inside out
[36:41] amen that's why the reason he showed his
[36:43] true colors at the end right now I want
[36:47] you to I want you all to consider the
[36:48] roll call of
[36:50] God's imperfect Heroes
[36:53] amen yeah now you to the world they have
[36:55] Heroes and this and all they talk about
[36:58] now is the Avengers and Captain America
[37:01] and Spider-Man and the Hulk and
[37:03] Wolverine and all these things you know
[37:05] why cuz the world is looking for a hero
[37:08] the world wants something amen something
[37:10] powerful something something big right
[37:13] but I want you to look at the heroes
[37:15] that God used and I want you to see
[37:18] amen I want you to see that Noah he got
[37:21] drunk one
[37:23] time yet God was able to use
[37:29] Noah
[37:30] God Noah was a saved person Abraham he
[37:33] lied about his
[37:35] wife but yet he was the man of the of
[37:38] that hour that God was
[37:40] using Sarah laughed at God one time and
[37:44] she didn't really literally just just
[37:46] laugh but she just giggled
[37:49] right yet she was she's spoken of so
[37:52] well of in Hebrews like she didn't do
[37:55] anything right amen Jacob was a deceiver
[37:58] y one of the biggest deceivers I've ever
[38:01] I've ever
[38:02] seen you read the the
[38:05] stories yet God changed his name to to
[38:09] to
[38:10] Israel and he fought fought with the
[38:12] angel wrestle with the angel and and he
[38:14] said I'm not going to leave here until
[38:15] you bless me cuz why God knew his heart
[38:18] amen amen God knew he was a prince yes
[38:21] sir Moses he murdered an Egyptian one
[38:25] time yet God took him and and changed
[38:28] him and let him see GL that it's not
[38:30] about Moses yep that's right it's about
[38:33] what God was going to do through him
[38:35] amen and he was able to bring out the
[38:38] the uh the the Israel uh the Israelites
[38:41] Rahab she was a harlot but she believed
[38:45] amen that the the the the message that
[38:47] the spies told her to do she let left
[38:50] that that the the uh Scarlet robe out Y
[38:54] and she believed it amen right and
[38:56] because of that she took action amen and
[38:59] because of that her and her household
[39:00] was
[39:01] saved yet she was a
[39:04] harlot Gideon he was fearful abely
[39:08] didn't want to go fight he didn't want
[39:10] to go do none of these things but God
[39:12] needed to use him see it's it's God God
[39:14] needs to use weak people right that's
[39:17] right that's BS down God needs to use
[39:19] people with weaknesses so that he can
[39:21] get Glory right amen right look at all
[39:24] these all these Heroes that we think of
[39:26] in the Bible Gideon Noah Abraham all
[39:29] these things yet they had these
[39:30] weaknesses in their
[39:32] lives they were
[39:34] losers right there were nothing but a
[39:37] bunch of
[39:38] losers but God Amen made them
[39:41] winners Samson had serious problems with
[39:44] lust and anger and at the end he said
[39:48] Lord just one more time he came back to
[39:51] his senses amen he said Lord one more
[39:53] time amen and and he recognized
[39:56] spiritually where he needed to be and he
[39:59] killed amen he was able to kill more
[40:01] Philistines that his death than what he
[40:03] did when he was
[40:05] living Eli he failed as a father because
[40:08] of his two
[40:09] sons but yet he was a priest y David he
[40:13] was an adulterer and a murderer yet God
[40:15] said he's a man after my own heart right
[40:18] amen think about that amen my amen
[40:22] Solomon married foreign wives who turned
[40:24] his heart to Idol towards idolatry
[40:27] but he had he he was the most wise man
[40:29] that was ever that ever
[40:31] lived and he built the the the the the
[40:34] the the temple yes that's right Elijah
[40:37] struggled with
[40:40] depression and the Elijah of our day he
[40:42] struggled with things Tred like that he
[40:45] was a nervous man he was he was weak he
[40:47] didn't want to do what he what he was
[40:48] called to do that's right and none of us
[40:51] amen that that if we have a calling from
[40:53] God we don't we don't we don't want to a
[40:56] lot of people say well I want to preach
[40:58] I want to do this you better be
[41:00] careful you better be careful cuz you
[41:02] don't know what you're getting into I
[41:03] would not want to be in the shoes that
[41:05] brother Brandon was
[41:07] in that Ministry amen that God chose him
[41:10] specifically he knew he was able to to
[41:12] work with him and to work that Ministry
[41:14] in his
[41:15] life but he went through a lot so Elijah
[41:18] he struggled with depression Jonah ran
[41:20] away from God but God still used them
[41:23] out of the mouth of mouth of a uh the
[41:25] mouth of a whale right Peter he denied
[41:28] Christ but Jesus had already told him
[41:30] I'd give you the Keys of the Kingdom he
[41:33] said I already prayed for you
[41:35] Peter he said Satan's going to try to
[41:37] sift you like wheat amen but I already
[41:39] prayed for you amen don't
[41:41] worry yet he denied Christ but Jesus
[41:44] didn't reject him he knew Peter would
[41:46] come back Paul he was complicit to
[41:49] murder and one time he argued with
[41:51] Barnabas oh but Christians they don't
[41:53] argue with each
[41:55] other
[41:57] Believers though they you know I heard
[42:00] one time when they when I when I was I
[42:02] was thinking you know when they talk
[42:03] about perfect love and everything is
[42:06] perfect love and we're all walking down
[42:08] the the the fields you know holding
[42:10] hands the roses are red and the violets
[42:12] are blue and everything is nice and Rosy
[42:15] while we're walking in this Christian
[42:16] way yeah and when we come to church we
[42:19] don't you know we don't have you know to
[42:22] deal with each
[42:25] other
[42:26] and God sometimes places a certain
[42:28] brother or a certain sister right there
[42:31] to try our
[42:34] patience but it's to see what you're
[42:36] going to do right and he's also dealing
[42:39] with the other brother and the sister
[42:41] too see God knows what he's
[42:43] doing and Paul the man of the hour the
[42:46] great man that he was yet he argued with
[42:50] Barnabas one day and they had to
[42:52] separate
[42:55] ways
[42:57] and Barnabas he compromised the gospel
[43:00] James and John wanted special seats in
[43:02] the
[43:05] Kingdom hey you you know you see you see
[43:08] that you see that you know I want to be
[43:10] better than you you know I have this
[43:12] position you know higher than
[43:14] you that spirit always off all stands
[43:17] out from there James and John they
[43:19] wanted special seats in the kingdom and
[43:21] all the apostles argued about who was
[43:23] the greatest right right
[43:26] but yet God used all these all these
[43:28] people amen at the end why because when
[43:31] the Holy Ghost is in charge amen it
[43:33] doesn't matter what you did amen doesn't
[43:35] matter if it's under the blood amen and
[43:38] then you your your desires have changed
[43:41] to know that you are glorifying him and
[43:43] you're going your life is dedicated to
[43:45] him amen all these things amen don't
[43:47] matter anymore God still God still can
[43:50] use you
[43:51] amen God still can use you
[43:54] so I remember the the time when when
[43:57] brother Brandon amen when he was in that
[43:59] in that restaurant and he was when he
[44:02] was there
[44:04] uh um condemning the the the lady right
[44:07] who who uh who was sitting there with a
[44:09] police officer and you know carousing
[44:11] and things and and he was there
[44:13] condemning he's like I can't believe
[44:15] this and then God says come here
[44:18] son takes him to a corner that's right
[44:21] back of the restaurant and he says look
[44:22] and he shows him that bumper of blood
[44:24] amen and that his s were the ones who
[44:27] put that who put him there on the cross
[44:30] oh but brother brandom he didn't make
[44:31] any mistakes but God wasted his time
[44:34] showing him that Vision
[44:36] then look that's what people think you
[44:39] know but brother brandom amen his sins
[44:42] put him on the cross just as our sins
[44:44] put him on the cross as well amen right
[44:47] and from there amen he left a different
[44:49] man exactly he left a different man he
[44:52] said I'm not one to condemn people and
[44:54] what he do what happened afterwards he
[44:56] went and talked to the lady and come to
[44:57] find out she was just in a backsliding
[44:59] condition right and she got saved right
[45:02] there right there amen right so when we
[45:04] have our minds changed amen that it's
[45:07] about him not about us amen God can do
[45:10] great things in our midst praise God
[45:12] going move a little quickly here judges
[45:14] if you want to read in judges chap uh
[45:16] chapter 7 this is the story of Gideon
[45:19] one of the heroes of
[45:23] God I want you to I want you to look at
[45:25] this real quick uh I'll read these
[45:27] verses here real quick then jobal who is
[45:31] Gideon and all the people that were with
[45:33] him rose up early and pitched beside the
[45:36] well of Herod so that the host of
[45:37] midianites were on the north north side
[45:40] of them by the hill of Mora in the
[45:42] valley and the Lord said unto Gideon the
[45:44] people that are with thee are too many
[45:46] to for me to give the midianites into
[45:49] their
[45:50] hands lest Israel vaun themselves
[45:52] against me saying my own hand hath saved
[45:55] me
[45:56] so what Jesus was what God was talking
[45:58] about here was
[46:00] that that he Gideon had a group of
[46:03] people and and God said you you have too
[46:05] many right yeah he said I don't want you
[46:08] to because I don't want you I don't want
[46:09] all these people to be fighting the
[46:25] fearful and Afraid let him return and
[46:27] depart early from Mount Gilead and their
[46:30] return of the
[46:32] people 20 and 2,000 22,000 and there
[46:36] remain 10,000 and the Lord said unto
[46:40] Gideon the people so now it's now down
[46:42] to from 22,000 now to 10,000 the people
[46:45] are yet too many God said bring them
[46:49] down onto the water and I will try them
[46:51] for there for thee there and it shall be
[46:54] that of whom I say unto to thee this
[46:56] shall go with thee the same shall go
[46:59] with thee and of whomsoever I say unto
[47:01] thee this shall not go with thee the
[47:03] same shall not go right so he brought
[47:05] down the people unto the water and the
[47:07] Lord said unto Gideon everyone that
[47:09] laeth of the water with his tongue as a
[47:11] dog laeth him uh lap laeth him shalt
[47:17] thou set by himself likewise everyone
[47:20] that bow down upon his knees to drink
[47:23] and the number of them that laed put in
[47:25] their hand to their mouth were 300 men
[47:28] but all the rest of the people bowed
[47:30] down upon their knees to to drink water
[47:33] so there was some that were lapping like
[47:36] a dog you know you know and then there
[47:39] were some that were taking the water and
[47:42] drinking you
[47:44] know and and so so the Lord says here
[47:48] and the Lord said unto Gideon by 300 men
[47:51] that La will will I save you and deliver
[47:55] the median ites into thine hand and let
[47:58] all the other people go every man unto
[48:00] his place so the people took took
[48:03] victuals in their hand and their
[48:05] trumpets and he sent all the rest of
[48:07] Israel man unto his tent and retained
[48:10] those 300 men and the host of midium was
[48:14] was beneath him in the valley and it
[48:17] came to pass that same night that the
[48:18] Lord said unto him arise get thee down
[48:20] unto the host for I have delivered into
[48:22] thine hand so God had already given them
[48:24] the people but it took down it took God
[48:27] Amen bringing down amen from 22,000 to
[48:29] 300 people and because through these 300
[48:33] people God was able to give them the
[48:34] victory amen so God doesn't need big
[48:37] armies God doesn't need none of this
[48:38] thing he just needs somebody dedicated
[48:40] to him amen somebody willing to lose
[48:44] their
[48:45] life amen because God only wants the
[48:49] glory to himself
[48:51] amen amen that that's what this is all
[48:53] about God wants glory for him himself
[48:57] amen amen praise God brother brandom
[49:00] says here in the message isn't that in
[49:04] the message prayer line he says isn't
[49:06] that beautiful Jesus Christ saying now
[49:08] you all believe John he was a prophet he
[49:11] just preached the way you all went and
[49:13] believed him and you know he was a
[49:15] prophet though he never done one Miracle
[49:18] but he was the greatest Prophet that
[49:20] ever lived Jesus said so until this time
[49:23] said never was a man born of a woman as
[49:25] great as John the Baptist he never done
[49:28] one miracle and only lived 6 months but
[49:31] why was he so great because he bore a
[49:34] record of Christ and when you see
[49:36] somebody giving God praise and God glory
[49:39] then you can realize that that person's
[49:41] coming from God right isn't that giving
[49:44] God the glory that's right and John said
[49:46] I must decrease and he must increase
[49:49] amen you know that was the testimony of
[49:51] John they said are you the Messiah he
[49:53] said I'm nothing but Jesus Jesus come
[49:56] around and said oh yes he is he's the
[49:58] greatest from among women that's better
[50:01] don't you think look what brother BR
[50:03] says here let somebody else say it
[50:06] right amen live so that somebody else
[50:10] will say it that's the way to do it do
[50:13] the right thing somebody God will bear
[50:16] record for you
[50:19] amen John went off the scene and he
[50:22] didn't make himself a great person he
[50:24] just did what he was called to do and
[50:27] Jesus was the one who bragged about him
[50:29] later on Amen and that's the thing that
[50:32] we should do
[50:34] Saints I always think of that scripture
[50:36] amen and I I think brother Dell brought
[50:38] it out here a couple of months ago you
[50:40] know when when you have the opportunity
[50:43] you know when Jesus said you have the
[50:44] opportunity to to have the higher seat
[50:46] you know back in the the podium or
[50:49] whatever you know but you go Jesus said
[50:51] go take the low seat you know exactly
[50:54] right and then later on they want to
[50:56] they can call you up and say but let
[50:57] them let them exalt you and and not you
[50:59] try to exalt yourself amen because
[51:02] that's that's amen that that uh that's
[51:07] what brings glory to God we can humble
[51:09] ourselves
[51:12] amen it should come to a point Saints
[51:14] amen that we we could get to the point
[51:16] that you know Jesus confound Satan so
[51:19] much and he didn't know if is was the
[51:20] son of God or if he wasn't the Son of
[51:22] God you
[51:23] know and it should come to the point
[51:25] amen that that that women that the Earth
[51:27] the world would think you know well I
[51:30] know that him or she can't do
[51:32] it I know him or her I know how they
[51:35] were so it can't be them amen it's got
[51:37] to be it's got to be something else than
[51:38] them amen it's got to be more than than
[51:41] them because I knew them when they were
[51:42] out in the world I knew them amen it's
[51:44] got to be more it's got to be God
[51:46] working in you Saints amen that's the
[51:50] point that's to the point where we have
[51:51] to be
[51:53] at Paul says here in 2 Corinthians
[51:56] says in verse 7 it says and lest I
[51:58] should be exalted above measure through
[52:01] the abundance of Revelations there was
[52:03] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[52:06] messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I
[52:09] should be exalted above measure for for
[52:13] for this thing I besought the Lord
[52:16] Thrice that it may that I that it might
[52:18] depart from me and he said unto me my
[52:22] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[52:25] strength is made perfect in
[52:27] weakness amen my strength is made
[52:29] perfect in
[52:32] losers amen most gladly therefore will I
[52:35] rather glory in my
[52:37] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[52:40] rest upon me amen amen again it's all
[52:43] about Christ amen so God told God told
[52:48] Paul he said my grace is sufficient and
[52:50] you don't have to understand it you
[52:51] don't have to my grace is enough just
[52:54] keep moving on right my grace is
[52:57] sufficient and I don't understand
[52:58] everything Saints I don't know I don't
[53:00] know all things I just know his grace is
[53:03] enough and he he'll he'll allow me to
[53:06] know amen what he wants me to know at
[53:08] the right time as as long as I stay
[53:11] humble before him amen therefore I take
[53:13] pleasure in
[53:15] infirmities can you say that Saints am
[53:18] in necessities and persecutions and
[53:21] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[53:23] am weak then I am strong
[53:26] so when I become a loser then I will
[53:29] live Amen in other words is what Paul is
[53:32] saying praise God so how many want to be
[53:36] losers tonight
[53:38] Amen brother Wade wants to be a loser
[53:41] yes sir God bless
[53:44] him I want to be a loser too I rais both
[53:47] of my hands amen but a loser in a loser
[53:50] for Christ
[53:51] amen don't don't take that in the wrong
[53:54] way you know exactly right that's right
[53:56] praise God but I'm going to lose myself
[53:59] Amen to that gain more of him amen
[54:02] because that's it if if you're in the
[54:04] way he can't use you and the more the he
[54:07] can only use what what you give him what
[54:09] what you give him if you only give him
[54:11] an arm to use that's all he's going to
[54:12] be able to use a leg to use that's all
[54:15] he's going to use but if you give him
[54:16] your whole body to use amen that's what
[54:19] he's going to use amen he'll do great
[54:21] things through you it doesn't matter if
[54:22] you think you're ugly doesn't matter if
[54:24] you think you're big doesn't matter if
[54:26] you think you're you're you know
[54:28] whatever have too many freckles on your
[54:30] face
[54:31] whatever God still can use youen and God
[54:35] may have you maybe not to preach maybe
[54:38] not to be a deacon maybe not to do
[54:41] something good great in the church or
[54:43] whatever but maybe just for you to be a
[54:46] witness to somebody a visitor that came
[54:48] in one time maybe it's you who is going
[54:51] to bring and Lead that person to Christ
[54:54] you know
[54:55] young people you know you think that you
[54:57] can't do you can't do that but you can
[54:59] be used by Christ even at this point if
[55:01] you let the holy spirit amen your
[55:03] testimony amen will either draw them
[55:05] away or will bring them closer am amen
[55:08] praise
[55:10] God um I going to give a little a little
[55:12] little a little story I I read the other
[55:15] day and um it's about this little
[55:17] 10-year-old boy I thought it was really
[55:19] neat about a little 10-year-old boy who
[55:22] Who had who was in a car accident and he
[55:24] had lost his left arm well as he was
[55:28] recuperating he decided he wanted to uh
[55:31] he wanted to take up
[55:34] Judo so he went to the to the sensei in
[55:37] the area and he said he said master I
[55:39] want you to teach me how to how to how
[55:41] to do Judo he said that's no problem I
[55:44] can teach you so day in and day out he
[55:47] would he would he would meet with his
[55:49] Sensei and the Sensei would only teach
[55:50] him one move just one move and day in
[55:54] Day Out he would go and he'd practice
[55:56] with the Sensei and it would be just one
[55:58] move that he would he would they would
[55:59] he would practice one day the boy got SK
[56:02] he he was got skep he was wondering and
[56:04] he asked the the the the Sensei he said
[56:06] he said Master I've been coming to you
[56:09] quite some time now and every time that
[56:11] I come all you teach me is the same
[56:13] move and he and the master told him he
[56:16] said Son you only this is the only move
[56:18] that you'll ever
[56:20] need so the boy he just took it he just
[56:24] took it in faith he said well I know
[56:26] what the master the master knows what
[56:28] he's doing and he just
[56:29] continued and I you know I wish we could
[56:32] take God that
[56:34] way like he told Paul he said but my
[56:37] grace is sufficient just keep moving on
[56:40] so the boy day in day out and one day
[56:43] there was a tournament that was to take
[56:46] place and the boy qualified to be part
[56:49] of this tournament and he fought in two
[56:53] of the F the first two the first two
[56:55] matches he fought and he was able to win
[56:57] just with this one move then the third
[57:00] match that he fought it was a little
[57:03] rougher but that person that got carried
[57:05] away didn't do something properly and he
[57:06] was able to beat this third person uh uh
[57:10] and he won the match with the same move
[57:12] and the boy still wondering he's like I
[57:14] what in the world how is it that this
[57:16] move can can with this I can I can
[57:19] win and so the boy was able to make it
[57:22] to the championship and so here comes at
[57:24] the championship ship this great bigger
[57:27] person than him Burly person and uh the
[57:31] referee got so scared of him because he
[57:33] saw that he had a a weakness and he he
[57:36] he had his left hand was gone and he
[57:38] said how in the world is he going to be
[57:40] able to beat this and he actually told
[57:42] the Sensei he said he said sir I don't
[57:44] think your boy should fight and the
[57:46] Sensei had so much confidence in him he
[57:48] said I know I know I have confidence in
[57:50] him I know that he can win it so he lets
[57:53] the boy fight well the as he's fighting
[57:56] the the the his opponent makes one wrong
[57:58] move and sure enough the boy does that
[58:01] that move and he wins and he wins the
[58:05] championship so they win the
[58:06] championship they're celebrating the
[58:08] trophy is is is is in his hand and him
[58:11] and the Sensei they're driving back home
[58:12] and he's asking the Sensei he said
[58:14] Sensei I still don't understand why it
[58:16] is day and day out this is all you
[58:19] trained me and I was able to win all
[58:21] these matches and he in the sense they
[58:23] say son look
[58:26] he
[58:27] said the thing is is that this one move
[58:30] is one of the hardest moves in Judo to
[58:32] do he said but you've done it so much
[58:35] that you've mastered it and he said and
[58:37] the only way that you can defend that
[58:39] move is by the person grabbing your left
[58:41] hand your left arm and you don't have a
[58:43] left
[58:47] arm so his weakness became his
[58:51] strength his weakness became his
[58:53] strength so you think you think my
[58:56] goodness I have these freckles on my
[58:58] face I have I I can't do nothing I don't
[59:01] know how to sing be front of the church
[59:03] whatever it may be whatever you you
[59:04] think might be your weakness God can
[59:06] take that weakness and use it for Glory
[59:08] of amen for his glory am it doesn't
[59:10] matter God knows what he's doing just
[59:13] like the Sensei he knew exactly what he
[59:15] was doing cuz he that's the reason why
[59:18] he had confidence in the boy he taught
[59:20] him well with just that one move right
[59:23] and God has given us everything that we
[59:24] need needed Saints for this hour cuz he
[59:26] knows that you and me can win and we're
[59:28] going to win why because we become
[59:31] losers that's right amen losers in
[59:33] Christ amen praise the Lord how many
[59:35] love the Lord tonight amen praise the

[1:06:20] beings that's when it just comes to the
[1:06:23] places
[1:06:25] he knows how to take over
[1:06:32] I amen and amen enjoy the message let's
[1:06:38] brother I
[1:06:40] believe the weaker we get the stronger
[1:06:43] he can
[1:06:44] get but if we think we're
[1:06:47] something it just won't work that's
[1:06:50] right we were going to a Minister's
[1:06:53] meeting one time and and most of you
[1:06:55] know Sam's Gap going up into Tennessee
[1:06:58] is really crooked and a lot of walls
[1:07:00] right along the side of you and things
[1:07:02] you know that no way and it's it's just
[1:07:05] lot it's hard for two cars let alone
[1:07:07] anything else we were going up one night
[1:07:10] and I was driving brother Tom's van
[1:07:12] there one day
[1:07:13] and and
[1:07:15] uh start to go around this curve and
[1:07:18] here comes a tractor trailer meeting us
[1:07:21] and the tractor part of it was all
[1:07:24] already over into my side of the
[1:07:26] road and he was coming in the curve with
[1:07:29] me so you know where the trailer was
[1:07:31] coming and right beside of us was a
[1:07:33] sheer straight
[1:07:35] wall I mean just rock cut
[1:07:39] down when we got out of
[1:07:43] that brother Tom said how did you do
[1:07:49] that I said Tom I done that just the way
[1:07:54] I get a
[1:07:56] sermon to
[1:07:58] preach I just put it in his
[1:08:01] hands cuz there was no way for us to
[1:08:04] meet in there like
[1:08:06] that something took over took care of it
[1:08:10] so you just put it in his hands you know
[1:08:13] recognize how weak you
[1:08:16] are you know recognize
[1:08:19] that then you'll see how strong he can
[1:08:21] make you all of those great warriors
[1:08:24] that there in the Bible they all had
[1:08:27] flaws and
[1:08:28] problems but you know God turn around
[1:08:30] and take the flaws and make it a great
[1:08:32] thing that's right make it a great thing
[1:08:36] so it is good to be a
[1:08:38] loser just lose
[1:08:40] ourselves get rid of ourselves and let
[1:08:44] him take over then he can make something
[1:08:46] out of it right tell our brother how
[1:08:48] much you appreciate the message tonight
[1:08:50] we appreciate you appreciate his his
[1:08:52] stand and appreciate him bringing the
[1:08:54] word of the Lord unto us remember the
[1:08:55] Bible study Saturday remember that
[1:08:58] remember brother pic next Wednesday

[1:09:01] another any other anything any

[1:09:11] the message that we've heard tonight yes
[1:09:13] we believe it you know Lord if we could
[1:09:17] just get ourselves out of the way then
[1:09:19] you could do a lot of things if we just
[1:09:22] depend upon you father
[1:09:24] then we'd be all right mankind fights a
[1:09:28] lot of wars and battles and things
[1:09:30] trying to figure things out but if he
