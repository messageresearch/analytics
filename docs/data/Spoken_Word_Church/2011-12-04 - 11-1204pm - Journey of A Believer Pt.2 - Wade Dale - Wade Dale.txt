so glad i found out he would bring me out and show me i'm so glad that i found out he'll bring me jesus me me bob let's all stand we'll send you a couple little courses here we're going to go to ksc we'll get great change over service here in one too how about hosanna 552. bless be the wrong my salvation is for he is ready oh glory to his name now we're gonna do it the way we always do it with the women's scene then we're gonna have the men so magnifying lure with me would be the man and then the woman would do glory glory all right joseph oh is uh um is is oh we'll change officers open the eyes i want to see i want see holy holy holy shining in the light of your glory holy holy holy holy amen holy holy holy i want to see and he is the word and that's what we come to see then come see a man i hope not you'll be very disappointed but if you come to see him and hear from him then you'll be blessed um good to be in the house with lord again good to have you each and every one of you back and i'm always afraid if i grab that thing i'm going to let it slip i'm always afraid of that um let that thing go and then flop up and scare everybody maybe we'll do that in the middle of service and wake everybody up beware it could happen if you got your bibles turn back to ezekiel and let's uh let's continue i thought i hope you enjoyed this morning it was uh it was a blessing to me uh you know sometimes you get up here and you labor like a label like an old mule and i know the other ministers know what i'm talking about and sometimes you get up here and everything is just a little bit smoother so uh i attribute that to you because you work the gifts i don't you work the gift and and you were doing very well this morning so let's just continue with that thought while we're standing let's go ahead and make our announcements again uh number one announcement um that um that's very important is that when brother dale does get back your kids children and your parents with children should go and personally thank brother dale for the uh for putting forth the the money to put the uh i know brother sterling it was his project which is uh very proud of what he'd done uh worked out very smoothly very well but somebody had to put the money so the church put the money to buy those things to for the children to have have a good time in the lord and and be able to play so just remember to thank brother dale for that and when he gets back and then remember also monica's class and younger is on the red blue and yellow playset i hope we kind of got all that straightened out in between services rachel's class and older on the green and brown play set because of the weight limits on each one kids watch them playing rough and if you want your kids to play together you know we've got one play set so we keep need to keep them separate one play set is a little bit stronger than the other one the problem we had with the older ones is some of the older kids were getting on it and breaking them so that's one of the reasons we decided to brother sterling came uh several months ago and wanted to do a project so that was a suggestion of mine and then it just kind of you know went on after that to get a a more sturdy playset i don't like for the kids to get hurt or or you know the equipment to malfunction so so we got a good set good strong set uh one of the older swings is set still out there and it has baby swings on it for the babies parents need to watch your kids we still have kids going behind storage building and going behind a big white fence just tell them don't go back there all right and remember that the seats in the back that safe for children and parents of the children only needs to be enforced the nursery is for children only with their parents no individual adult child needs to be back there there's no need of it we have too much we got too many kids now not not too many kids but we've got so many kids that little room can get congested and that is a crow rim set aside for children all right if you're sick like i said go downstairs or you can sit in a as a real comfortable recliner if you feel you need to sleep you can go back in the recliner in the office and the pastor's study all right um we have announcements brother joe we kind of kind of we kind of got all this on the website now uh the bible study six o'clock next saturday which is the 10th communion will be next sunday the 11th we usually have it on the first sunday but the end of brotherdale's not here we'll do it next sunday uh the 18th will be the christmas gathering that we always have that will be the third sunday 25th which will be christmas day there'll be no services here at all on the 31st we'll start at 8 o'clock for the watch night service for the tommy earnest uh brother that we got to know out in wichita is going to be the minister that night and the first service on new year's day there will only be one service and it will be at one o'clock on sunday only one service at one o'clock on sunday all right and january the 14th will be a minister's meeting at brother gerald hughes church so if any of you ministers want to go uh i think i'm going to try to make that one because a few days after that brother donnie and myself and and brother zach and dad are gonna go hunting in uh alabama for a few days so just keep us in your prayers and uh that pretty much gets all the announcements out of the way so ezekiel 36 verse 24. let's pray your heavenly father we pray lord that you be with us again one more time lord just be the active participant in this service not a bystander lord but an active participant that will take these words lord that the human beings try to put together lord we we do a terrible job of of trying to put together an eternal word the father you gave us you gave us teachers pastors apostles prophets to break it down to the people lord so that they can understand you better lord i pray today that lord the people as they go away that that they'll understand you father just a little bit better and it'll help them in their journey in life helping their journey in christianity lord we pray now that you touch the sick and afflicted be with each one lord that's sick here in the building and the ones that are away lord be with mom and dad i'm sure they're on the road now traveling back just be with them on the highways forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make the things that we do that are not pleasing to you father just be lord i know you're gracious but just help us lord in the things that we do lord we want to come to that adoption lord where you're you're not only pleased to dwell but lord you're you're able to speak through us to the people father and the people be able to speak back father give us today our daily bread in jesus name we pray amen ezekiel 36 24. for i will take you from among the heathen and see you know what he did abraham see you can find that right into this journey all right he took abraham from out from among the heathen he said get away get away from him come and come and follow me in other words and gather you out of all countries and we'll bring you into your own land we have a possession we have a land all right then will i sprinkle clean water upon you start off with good washing of the water by the word good water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and then back to romans 8 30. i love this scripture because it's so positive moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified let's read 31 what shall we do then what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us you may be seen the lord has blessing to the reading of the word we'll get started again i want to kind of background a little bit and everybody pretty much got the justification down all right the justification part we we kind of um like i said we got some new ones and and i was corrected about this bucket list but you know what the bucket list is something that you're going to do before you kick the bucket i ain't kicking the so bucket making my own bucket lid but i ain't kicking the bucket oh minnie you know what i can say that luther couldn't say that wesley couldn't say that pentecost couldn't say that we can say that in this end time you said well i'm old reactor could take place in a week from now two days from now what's holding up the rapture is there anything left there's nothing left i believe all the uh all the players are on the field i believe 144 000 they're alive and well over there somewhere i believe the two prophets they're alive and well over there somewhere we just got to get out of the way you and i are holding this whole thing up abraham on his journey he held a few things up he went over here remember he went over here and went over here god said i gave you a promised land and you know what's so wonderful read the future home where brother branham talks about the new city i'll just give you this as a little fall the new city remembers going to push up on the mount of olives you know that new city you know brother brown said it's on the exact spot that we're going to talk about today right that's what he said the exact spot that abraham met this man will be the literal spot he says that that new city is going to push up oh man we're going right back to it abraham was looking for a city and it was right under his feet but it was veiled it was veiled skin because melchizedek that jesus christ is the city he's the city he's the one abraham was looking for but abraham was looking for a literal city with no little city's coming down but that literal city is in you today if you have the new birth so we had to get out we had to get all of us together to make that city all right so just want to put that in here and you have to think for a while but being justified we come down through and we see how that he came to bethel how that he uh got called him and he separated himself but he took a lot with him he made a lot of mistakes but finally he come to a place and we ended up here in sanctification which is in chapter let's go back and start there 15. because you met melchizedek gave him bread and wine that was the priest of the most high god that was who that was god made manifest in another form called melchizedek that was not jesus you'll hear me you'll listen to what brother brown says he said that was not jesus it wasn't jesus the flesh see melchizedek couldn't die for your sins even though that's almighty god that took away your sin that wasn't the lamb of god amen that wasn't the sacrifice right your high priest wasn't the sacrifice he made the sacrifice so he was making the sacrifice but the sacrifice hadn't come yet because jesus had to be born like you and i were born because in the garden adam became a full-grown man but when they had children they were little babies so they came through the mama you understand everybody know what i'm talking about so as they came through the womb to pollute it god had to come to the through the womb to cleanse it all right so it couldn't be that just melchizedek just walks up and we're going to read it we're melchizedek steps up sprinkles a little 16 elements of the earth walks in front of abraham but that earth couldn't be the sacrifice it had to be born of a woman because of why genesis 3 15. genesis 3 15 said i'll put empty between thee and now and seed and the woman's seed in other words i'm going to go i got to come to the woman again i got to come to the woman i i wanted to come another way but this is the way i'm coming right i got to come this way because y'all messed up so melchizedek couldn't be jesus you'll hear me read brother around makes quote he said because it wasn't jesus but then he said melchizedek became jesus christ do you see the difference yes that was jesus christ in theophany form as melchizedek but that wasn't jesus that saved your soul because this is what does it right here this this guy had to come and be a sacrifice then the soul that was inside that man did what that's where the eternal life come from he had to die release the life so it could come back into uni right all right melchizedek couldn't do that right everybody understand that but he was prefigured in melchizedek because jesus said before abraham was i am amen in other words if you don't understood abraham you'd understand me you'd understand moses you'd understand me why because he was back there that theophany that was in jesus christ amen now not two different people it's not jesus and in god jesus was almighty god still is almighty god but in morphy brother brother makes that makes that clear he morphed in to melchizedek just like the little boy that that was in the play one boy played five different parts same person same person he just put on one mask come out and played the villain went back put on another mass play that's what god did because remember jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now you'll hear brother brown say jesus had a beginning and an ending the flesh part he's talking about the earthly journey of jesus i want to get that straight with you because i'm going to read some quotes it's going to really sometimes not going to sound like like jesus say jesus he said jesus had a father and a mother but then you're going to hear brother brown and say jesus never called mary mother he called a woman read who is this melchizedek brother branham partial revelation in his early ministry you could hear him kind of look but when he come to who is this melchizedek he said jesus never called her mother called her woman because he she only she thinks she done she was just an oven an incubator to where the the egg and the germ was put to create that body that wasn't melchizedek but melchizedek was inside there did everybody understand that yes and we had a lot of new ones so we need to really understand when i read these quotes where he says jesus jesus wasn't this wasn't jesus remember he's talking about the flesh it's about the flesh man jesus was not standing in front of abraham because that flesh man jesus was promised to come to a woman john said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world the lamb which was the what sacrifice right all right because really well we'll get to it i don't know you understand that but when i read these quotes sometimes you click over and say what is he meaning by that you got to remember what i'm talking about with brother branham he's he's telling us that it's not jesus the flesh man wasn't standing in front of abraham but jesus standing over there telling the pharisees before abraham was i am that that was inside that body was standing there almighty god same one to talk to adam same one and talk to him noah same one and talk to moses same one that talked to abraham same one because remember like i said to that this morning brother brown says jesus knew all things because he was word first that's right attribute thought right word flesh and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now what you and i did we bypassed coming in that word form all right you were nothing you weren't a theophany floating somewhere you were in jesus that's why you got to that's why you look at abraham abraham identified himself with melchizedek you've got to identify yourself with not just that flesh that was standing in front of abraham but the theophany that's right brother brown calls it the theophany of god was standing in front of abraham do you know here's where that we you know our our eyes sometimes sometimes we don't see things in the right order because of the way we were born or the way we were raised but if we understand that what's inside of us was a part of that what was inside of us what's inside of us if you're born again what's standing in front of abraham can we be that blind is it a different god is it a different new birth it's the same theophany that's why folks we can understand the word and other people can't understand it now it wasn't my literal eyes that was standing there but by the eyes of faith and what's inside of me i can see i was there that's right brother said you walked the shores of galilee when jesus walked the shores when jesus went to hell in his theophany you went with him so you don't have to go anymore you already been to hell one time you don't have to go again amen we live in hell but you don't have to go literally because listen jesus literally you laughed but he went to hell with me inside of me that was my representation satan you can't touch this and if i'm a part of that that's right he can't touch me sanctification cleaned and set aside for service is that correct justification is he picks the bottle up the bottle's dirty but he has brought it from one condition to this condition he's going to use it he's not going to pick it up and throw it away he has picked it up for a purpose but it's dirty you don't want to drink anything out of it but now we come to the part of sanctification chapter 15 after these things i forgot to tell you guys we were going to do this again sorry we had to kind of adjust a few things if you forgive me and forgive them i didn't get to where i wanted to get so i marked the spot to stop that and they stopped at a different spot but it was all my fault i didn't i was too long-winded this morning so after these things the word of the lord you may have to read them out of your bible after these things what after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram now we're in chapter 15 of genesis i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram said lord god that was jehovah adonai what will thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eleazar of damascus and abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine and that's where we stopped at and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven right here and tell the stars as thou be able to number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness for he said unto him who god said unto abram i am the lord see there's there i am i am the lord that brought thee out of earth the challenge now what's he doing he's reminding abram where he came from all right he said lord god i or the child is to give me this land to inherit it and he said lord god same thing again whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it so god says okay i'm going to show you now let's go through this right here we'll we'll read a few scriptures and then we'll let brother brown tell you what went on and he said unto him take me and heifer of three years and a she go to three years and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon now all of these listen all of these animals are used in atonement now and one is very specific if you look in numbers 15 27 a she-goat was used for an ignorance offering thank god for that we all need some of that but actually in numbers 15-27 shigo is for an ignorance offering and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not and the reason he didn't divide the birds if you'll read brother branham is the i think it was abram's covenant confirmed i can't remember the year he says he left the doves together because of divine healing the other was he pulled apart all right the doves he left together all right so what's that now watch what abram now watch abram it's abram still it's not abraham it's abram and when the fowls came down upon the carcass abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo and horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abram no of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years now what's he talking about he takes abram all the way back to israel or not back but forward to israel being caught in egypt for 400 years right and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge which was egypt and afterwards shall they come out with great substance that was who moses and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in a fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and that's this day remember brother brown was going to israel and the angel of the lord took him to this scripture right here that the nick with the amarax was not yet full which is the gentiles in this day was not yet completed and it came to pass that when the sun went down what was it the evening time and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces and the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying satan unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates now let's read if you pull up number three let's read what brother brown said in faith now and when he did abraham then he said when he did that the birds came down and began to light on the sacrifice and abraham drove them away until the sun went down now watch there was three elements a real horror came over abraham of darkness then after that he saw a smoking furnace then after that he saw a lighted lamp and watch what that represented this little lamp went right between each of those sacrifices confirming the covenant to abraham not nothing abraham done but god's covenant grace unconditionally not if you will abraham is what i've done not if you do this if you do that it's what i've already done what he would show in christ showing the sacrifice just a moment i'll get to that first the darkness death every man do i walk through the valley of the shadow of death next a smoking furnace hell wherever sinner belongs but after that comes a little light oh god grace amazing grace lighting up the way making a covenant well you say brother branham i don't see the covenant all right here it is now and then he goes through and he tells about remember how the the chinese man would the chinese people would tear them tear the tokens in two give you one part and you take the other part and they had to match before you could get your get your clothes back well that's what he's talking about but watch what happened in sanctification now going through our journey look what abram has to do what's the sacrifice consist of blood right there's blood right there's death and that constitutes the atonement we know what happened at calvary but this is the pre-figure that he pulled those animals apart and god swore when he went through them in the light and told him he said abram he just told him he said your seed let's read it again right here abram verse 16 unto thy seed have i given this land now wait a minute he said i've given this land he said i'm not he didn't say i'm going to give it to you i've given this lamb now see how close how confident god is with abram that he's going to make it but watch abram's confidence in doing all that god tells him to do and then god puts him to sleep and says you're out of the picture i'm the one that does the sanctifying i'm the one that's doing all this you don't have anything to do with it now listen that was still abram that wasn't abraham you'll see brother brown i mean he quoted abraham but it's not it's abram all right now he shows the prophecy of calvary and all the things that you and i must just be let's be honest with each other when we were first started in our christian journey and justification even in in sanctification where where god is is taking that thing called a bottle and cleaning it up washing it out by the water of the word cleaning it up how are we cleansed by the blood right right we're cleansed by the blood of jesus christ remember jesus his body was hung on calvary but his blood hit the earth and sanctified the earth right right noah's day flood justification sanctification when jesus was on the cross and his blood cleansed and what claimed everything that was here on the earth right and the fire baptism comes later on for the earth but watch how abram is doing these things and god's showing him abram is not your sacrifice it's not you it's me i'm the one that's doing it i'm bringing this light but i'm confirming my covenant at sanctification and this is what god did for me he confirmed his covenant with me because he kept talking to me he kept showing me things he kept letting me walk in his word you say let me yeah he kept letting it was my choice but still he kept putting things look what he done look what he told abram to do get this get this get this tear this apart stand in between keep the buzzards off in other words keep the old devils off keep the sacrifice clean and then i'm going to meet you he come down with the light remember brother brown said you said he come down with that light went in between what jesus christ was torn at calvary right that's your that's your type jesus was torn at calvary and we must accept you say i did that in justification well i did too i accepted that the blood cleansed me but really did you really understand it one more time did you really understand it no you really didn't i'll say you really didn't because i really did and i'm not the smartest pencil sharpest pencil in the drawer or the brightest color who said they mean always my brother i'm going back up here now but that's rip but honestly that's my walk that i can see abram in what i was doing that's why i really enjoyed going through 12 13 14 15 16 17 these chapters and gleaning all this out that this real man went through this man was real he was a real man abram was not a you know figment of our imagination and melchizedek wasn't either a lot wasn't either you got to get all the players together lot wasn't either these people were real man a real man got up every morning walked god spoke to him he said okay he said okay i'll do it i'll get the sacrifice give me you know three three of this and three of these and through this what's the same thing with you and i in justification let me tell you something about justification i forgot this morning we're still a little bit ornery some more than others we're just a little joyce oh see we all go to the point because we can relate to this that's okay i don't mind that george you slap him if you want to he needs some sanctification but we can relate to this guy i can relate to what abram what god come down and did to abram and what my journey is and your journey is i can relate to this this real guy but you know in sanctification there's a lot of things you really you just got to be cleaned and set aside for service right so that jar you know what happens it hurts when you get kids where's the kids kids when you get real dirty i know that julie's daughter didn't she's always been clean but if you get dirty what does your parents do they don't take a feather and clean you off right nobody they take soap lava soap and they take the the the hardest rag they can find and what do they do scrub you clean that's what the lord's doing with that bottle that's what the lord's doing with abram he said abram you got some work to do now you got some work to do you got some sacrifices to make you got some things you got to believe in you got to believe in me and that's what happened in sanctification for this old guy now let's turn to are we dead back there hebrews 6 and let's read hebrews 6 because see what's paul oh they've done a wonderful job paul is picking up exactly what we're talking about now where did paul get all of his writings from the old testament he took the old testament and it and transposed it into the new testament right he got where'd he get it from he said well he got it from god he read the old testament remember he was a scholar the word had been put in his heart or in his in his physical person and then when god quickened it just like the the people in the uh upper room what quickened in the upper room it quickened all the word that they held for all those three and a half years that's why people even though you'd be sanctified you say well god i'm having so much trouble in god lord help me he's trying just sit here and pack it in pack it in and one day god's promise he promised abram he said abram you notice he didn't give him the land at first but he said i've already gave it to you he said you got a little work to do you got a little journey to go through for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured who abram patiently endured he obtained the promise god told him a long time ago you're gonna have a kid right you have a child you've got to have a child because something's got to start you got to be a father of nations so you're going to have to start having children here right yes so after he endured he got the promise now look abram was still abram but abram has got a new attitude abram has got a new now let's go back to ezekiel let's go to let's go to the interval let's read that when we we read them let's go to the interval quote number four and let's see what brother how brother branham explains for any of you new christians that that that need to really look at the three steps of justification read the future home and read this right here read the interval it's really good 1956. god prophesied through the prophet said i will write my laws in their hearts where i put them in the table of their hearts showing that would be the dwelling place of god in the human heart not the human head but the human heart they manage i will write them in my heart in their heart and they'll keep my statutes and go forth saith the lord god said in another place over in ezekiel i will in that day take out your old fleshly stony heart and i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you now a lot of people even you pentecostal people a lot of times get mistaken on that you get a new spirit that's not god's spirit brother brown said you get a new spirit at sanctification that's why we're at sanctification you get a new spirit that's not god's spirit that's you that isn't god you get a little happy because you got a new spirit and you jump up and down run around over the floor maybe in shout a little bit and speak with tongues i didn't have any of us and run around a little bit and think you've got the holy ghost that's not it that's the new spirit god gives you thank you then after he gives you your spirit then he said i'll put my spirit that's what the matter listen to this have you ever heard this word missed meal cramps what he's talking about is missing the meal the word of god you got in other words you got hunger pains that's what's the matter with the missed meal cramps you got today that's right that's the reason you can't get nowhere with god all right true now the next one keep going continue notice you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen i will put a new spirit in them and i will put my spirit in them he said after he gives you a new spirit that's you don't get confused with god's spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit if he ever gives it to you let's read that one more time it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit if he ever gives it to you pretty strong words huh amen because you and your condition never get along you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband can't get along with your neighbor how are you ever going to get along with god that's right so he has to give you a new spirit for you can get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you now his spirit is what the holy spirit gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new faith then he puts his holy spirit in you notice back there in the beginning when that same manner that fell out here on the ground every day the people eat it but notice those people who eat that manna would get hungry before nine o'clock that's the missed meal cramps so he gives you a new spirit that's not the holy spirit so in the type with abram watch what he's got abram abram's got things to do here he's he's even now in verse 16 or chapter 16 he goes and says he listens to his wife talking about the handmaid hagar and sarah i said unto abram behold now the lord has restrained me from bearing i pray that go into my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearken to the voice of sarah now we're not going to for a length of time not get into that because we got to get to the to the holy ghost but that's what happened through the ages when in a sanctified condition you still make mistakes that's right you know and type abram made a mistake in justification by trying to get his wife away and then sanctification here he is here because remember he didn't have a revelation of who that baby was to come through he'd have revelation or he wouldn't knew it would have been sarah sarah but it's supposed to be sarah right right but now god told him what he was going to do you're going to have a child you have a promised son but he didn't say but see abram if he would have been abraham see he got a revelation that it was sarah but he didn't right so in sanctification we there's a lot of things and sanctification is very very i've always you know what i'm going to say sanctification is very dangerous just like that right there just like that quote brother bryan said if he ever gives it to you at all why because you think in sanctification that you got the baptism of the holy ghost satan says you're done you're sealed in no problem you just do whatever you want to do everything will be fine just you know just you know make a few offerings and a few sacrifices and you'll be okay uh you you're going to church now you you you're communing with with saints be careful be really careful now listen abram is a wonderful type because abram kept going abram did become abraham that's you and i the true believer still go keeps going on now if this would have been this day let's just say this way abram decided to just sit down and relax he took his shoes off in the tent didn't go anywhere else he just took his shoes off just sit down and and relax and and he was happy with his with his wife and and he's happy with his concubine hagar and he's got this child called ishmael dear lord a wild child abraham knew right then that wasn't the promised son amen because god said he would bless this more but ishmael was not the promised son do you understand that that's right sanctification is not your promise the holy ghost is your promise sanctification is not the land it's going to the land the holy ghost is your land that's your possession brother chris that's something you gotta fight for that's something you gotta that's gotta be your one goal brother brown said the holy ghost is the most important thing you could ever do in your life is seek for that holy ghost seek for it like many times when aaron was preaching really enjoy brother aaron's message last wednesday really enjoyed it did a wonderful job and the rest of him did too but a little partial by there i like it he's one of us but um he's on our team but um you know and it's exactly right we got to understand that that's the most important thing get the new birth and then god starts adding things to it now he made abram the promise he's making you a promise you read in the bible that i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and i'm going to do this but you've got to possess that did he not tell abram go and possess the land well you got it no he said go position you got to get into that land you got to get into that holy spirit to where god can talk to you because you're not a child until then so he gave abram a new attitude because remember brother branham said and i didn't bring the quote that you become a part of a religious order you remember the affair i mean the jesus the uh disciples he said sanctify them through thy truth our word is truth and judas was with them brother brown said judas was sanctified under what jesus said and he was a devil right remember he showed his colors he didn't go on to to pentecost right but he was part of a religious order he even says that your name goes on the book at sanctification now listen god don't sit there and write names and transfer it's just trying to get us to what happens you remember what i've always said god doesn't need to know what he's doing he knows what he's doing he's just trying to get us to see what he's doing all right so that's the part that we see our book put on because judas remember jesus said he said do not glory in the healing he said glory that your name is written in heaven and judas was with him so there had to be an explanation there was a name written there judas's name was written in the book of life but it was not written in the lamb's book of life but you you you start you start look look at abram able started making sacrifices like this several things type in christ he was doing things in sanctification that he didn't do in justification same thing with you and i but god is moving him up a little bit at a time a little bit at a time same thing with you or not and that's what happened in your journey please if but don't stay a part of a religious order that's right it's okay to become a part of religious order because all the other disciples were but they went on to pentecost and received the holy ghost and just wasn't a part of a religious order anymore because you know brother brown said that's what the satan will do he'll make you feel religious just like that you'll get this new spirit and you'll go i must be the holy spirit but somewhere along the line there's a chicken up time somewhere along the line you got to meet melchizedek again like abraham did because every son of the faith remember will go through this journey just like abraham did and we got to meet melchizedek who god in human flesh all right you become a part of a religious order ezekiel says i'll give you a new spirit you'll go to church now let's go to chapter 16 we see what happens there that he's still messing up but he's part listen he brought a birth a conception it was in the wrong woman with the wrong woman right brother brown said false preachers bring false births now abram wasn't false but there's a lot of people that if they stay in that sanctified condition they can do a lot of things a lot of damage because satan's right in there with that new spirit and he's weaving his little way in there remember he can't get in there when it's the holy spirit he can't get in that inner court can't get in there holy holy can't do it or he'd be your brother but boy he can mess around with those other ones he can mess around with each and every one of us message preachers come on people i've always said when this thing's over with yes and you're still here i better run for my life and daddy better run for his life because if they don't make it if we don't make it you don't make it your pastor's ordained to what leads you through okay so we're gonna have a lot of mad people when this thing's over with i promise there'll be a lot of so-called message preachers that got a new spirit one day that's uh gonna have to run for the hill but you know what abram though never lost sight of the promise and that's what you and i got to do never lose sight of that promise he promised us we'd have a land and when he promised us we'd have a land then there must be somebody that can get us to that land just like brother brown said if god told that you know told that black man said if god told you to go through that wall would you go through it he said god said it yes he'd have to make a way before i got to that wall to get through it if that's what he said amen so if that's what he said if he said we're going to make a change of the body somebody's going to have to do it like we're talking about you know it's not going to be anything natural it's going to be something supernatural because jesus walked in that world of supernatural faith and that's what you and i are going to have to walk in but abram didn't stay where he was he was trying to do and that's just like i was telling brother mark i think or somebody the other day maybe brother donnie brother mark we were talking about something i'd rather see somebody like brother chris just i just can't see that that water baptism i just what's the difference what's the difference right well you know i just really can't you know brother mark people struggle and that to me that's fine and then see the victory on the other side instead of seeing somebody come in like a house on fire on a windy day and sit on the front row and scream hallelujah praise god i've never had this this is this is the best place i've never heard this type of revelation and six months later they're gone what they got in your spirit but they didn't get the holy spirit said he got the holy spirit that he saved not by saying just here i'm not anywhere i see it in other churches people be on fire one day and you go back and preach for them two months later and you say well where's brother so-and-so oh he's back to smoking out in the world you know we got preachers like that in the message two friend preachers of mine out in the world having babies they're girlfriends how can you do that you got a new spirit but the holy spirit doesn't do that but a new spirit will cause you to do that but you know what they did somewhere they stopped in their journey that is the difference they stopped in their journey and they said this is it this is it no this ain't all of it this might be it but this ain't all of it abram goes over chapter 17 and when abram was 90 years old and nine he was 99 years old god meets it god makes him at 99 years old from 20 from from 75 to 99. abram walked through this journey of justification and sanctification just like i'm explaining to you so if you get it in a day a week a year or 20 years what does it matter that's right what does it matter see that's where it comes down to the greatest part because you you know you you think well gosh they've been here 20 years i still doing what they were doing well you know what the light ain't clicked on yet right so don't give up on anybody nobody right we to give up on a lot of people people give off on brother dawn oh man he's just no no he just got out of the way a little a little bit but he made it back but listen when abram was 99 the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the all mighty god and say that in sanctification remember back over in sanctification he said what do you say to him saying after these things the lord cometh said i am thy shield and i exceeding great reward now he comes over in chapter 17 and we're talking about the new birth listen how positive this whole chapter is and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god which is translated if you've got a scofield bible and brother brown verifies it as el shaddai which is the breasted god in other words abram strength was about gone he'd done about all god told him to do he also went into this hagar and had this ishmael and and that went right you know and we wander around i'm like god what's going on but somewhere god's going to meet you somewhere god's going to say i am the almighty god in other words you've lost all your strength that's right you're done right that's why i like people to run yeah run run run run run cause you're gonna get tired you're gonna get tired you're gonna get tired running and when you do god's gonna say i'm right there just lean on me i'll give you all the strength you need abram was 99 physically the man needed some strength right because listen let's just be honest and be adult about this thing abraham abram wasn't capable of having a kid at 99 years old that's right sarah surely wasn't at 89 years old or wherever she was so god in other words god has to get you to a place and that's what he did to me and that's what he's got to do each one of us that don't have any birth and the ones that you do know what i'm talking about he's going to get you to a place where you don't know what to do you're done god i've tried everything i've tried this i've tried that i've done this i've made this sacrifice i've done this i've done this i've done that just like abram i mean i'm messing up he said okay that's all right just lean on me you know when i forgot first come back to the lord i was sitting right over here when the church was in the l-shape the lord you know you've heard my testimony and i had began to hurt in my chest and i said lord if you take that away then i'll go to church and i went to church on the way to church the devil now i'm not kidding the devil was so real because he was fixing to lose somebody he can feel it he's very spiritual he can feel god moving towards you and he does too he told me the whole time i was coming to church daddy didn't know i was coming he told me he said you're not good enough you're not good enough you have done all this you have done messed up you have done and you know i want a murderer thief or a liar or anything like that i mean i was a liar but i wasn't thief i didn't do anything real bad i thought but that was the worst case you can be in is to have a little self-righteousness but i'm coming to church and i'm not kidding you it was just pounding in my head you're not good enough turn around and go back you are not good enough to even go in that church you know what i finally said you're right i shut up amen i come in and sit down right over there about where danny's sitting you know what dad preached on that night you're not good enough to be saved not joking not down alive he preached on you're not good enough to be saved and he and it just of course i came to the lord but that was my journey i will come to the place that i was done i was out of options abram was out of options option one and option two was gone option three he was dead right in his own flesh you understand what i'm saying 99 years old can't perform can't can't can't be husband and wife together that's what he said he said me and she said me have pleasure with my lord we're going to read this with melchizedek we may not get finished tonight but me have pleasure with my lord again but you know what that's why abram is the father of our faith because he kept going and he kept plugging he kept coming to church he kept listening he kept reading the bible he kept talking about the lord he kept doing the right things he said oh he did something he did some wrong things but he kept moving he kept moving he kept going because you know what somewhere back in that in that back part of abraham abraham's mind he said god where's that city where's that possession that you told me i could have and it was going to come from me he just messed up and used hagar but then he gets a revelation when he meets melchizedek melchizedek says sarah is the one that you're going to have the child with not hagar et sarah because what did they what did abram abraham say he said all that ishmael may what may walk before you wrong one wrong child all right let's finish jesus i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou anytime you heard that word in the last every month and i will make my covenant between me and me and will multiply thee exceedingly and what does it say in genesis 1 26 and 27 to multiply and replenish the earth that's when you're born again that's when the spoken seed word multiplies a group of people from nothing to a group of people from look at william branham he goes across the curtain of time he sees millions of people he said are these all browns he said no these are all your contracts come from that one man dwight moody brother brown said send a million souls to heaven that's spiritual multiplication but without the new birth remember the seed life has to come through the body without the new birth you won't be there and without hearing the word from somebody that has it i've always said before i i've never been to new york city but sister johnny i would have confidence to get in the car with her and go to new york because she's been there all right well she knows her way around i want to get with somebody that knows the way around i want to get with somebody that's an adopted son of god you know why because i can power myself after that person not be that person but pattern myself jesus christ abram abraham watch his journey and it'll help you i know we're not going to get finished okay but we'll pick it up maybe some other time as for me behold verse 4 my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham now what does abraham mean means a father of a great multitude for a father of many nations have i made thee now look at verse six seven and eight he changed his name to abraham but still watch god come on the scene and i will verse 7 and i will verse 8 and i will what god's covenant is unconditional folks he's going to have a bride right his sole purpose is to have a bride he's going to have a bride whether you want to be one or not he's going to have one right he has made a promise yes i will i will i will make the exceedingly fruitful that's right what multiple from this earth and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god i will i will look at all those i wills i mean heavens look at it i will i will i will now what does he do he comes up to circumcision verse 10 let's try to finish this pretty quick this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after the every man child among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant with which me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generation he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought without money must need to be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant now god's not finished because he needs a bride that can conceive and god said unto abraham as for sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarah but sarah which is the princess shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her and i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of earth then abram fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that isn't 100 years old and shall sarah that is 19 years old bear now what's abram do old abram spoke up old abram spoke up and said he forgot what god said god said i will i will i will i will i will and abram said i can't god said you didn't hear what i said i said i will correct and i mean that's what he said he said i will great then abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is 100 years old shall sarah that is 90 years old bear and abram said unto god old edition one might live before thee see it goes back to the ishmael part god says sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him god had to bring abra i had to bring abraham and say look he had to grab me by the ears he said listen ishmael is not part of this hagar is not part of this your ideas is not part of this this is my idea yes don't worry about this body thing because where do you get a body change in there it doesn't say that they kind of grew up younger all of a sudden all of a sudden they meet melchizedek and melchizedek tells them what's going to happen then they take a 300 mile journey and then abimelech wants to marry this old grandma that's 99 years old or 90 years old somewhere in there there's a body chain you know what i'm saying what i'm saying is there's no formula to the body change there's no this no there is to a degree there's a formula to go by but there's not a in the scripture we know what brother brown said brother brown said that abraham woke up one morning and looked over and said i got to bed with the wrong woman and sarah wakes up and says whoops abraham that's what happened that's what he said he changed their bodies back so they could receive the promised sign all right we're not going to get finished so i'm not going to hurry because and we'll just finish up a little bit later on i'm sorry i don't want to keep it too long all right let's go to let's finish reading this because i want to get something to you here but my covenant verse 21 will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear to thee at the set time of the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money and every mail among the men of abraham's house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the self-same day as god had said unto him and abraham was 90 years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin and ishmael and his sons and in other words all the other ones were doing the same way now let me just it's kind of carnal but look in joshua five because this happened again but look what happened joshua chapter five and verse two i know guys i'm going backwards on this but i gotta get to a point to stop and then we'll just kind of maybe go over it the next time we speak which will be that that will be okay look at verse two at that time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time and joshua made in sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskin and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way they came forth from egypt then they had not circumcised for the children of israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord and unto whom the lord swear that he would not show them the land which the lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised him by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their place in the camp till they were whole and the lord said this day i've rolled away the reproach of egypt from off of you look what it says in verse 8. they bowed in their camp until they were whole you get circumcised at 99 years old you're gonna walk different you get circumcised at 20 years old you're gonna walk different you understand your walks different when you receive the holy ghost that's what that there was a confirmation with a circumcision right which type getting rid of the old flesh right they walked different they had to wait a while till they could go in there because remember they were going into promised land they were going to fight they had to wait a little while until they got home where they could walk but they walked different when he said him until they were made whole same way with abram abram was now abraham abraham now knew that god was going to have that child or make him have that child through sarah but that was one other thing they were still old because when he circumcised he said he was 99 so they had to they had to see something they had to meet somebody so they met this man called melchizedek now let's turn back over to genesis and we'll finish right here because every son of the faith has got to take this same journey and meet this man melchizedek verse chapter 18 verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight that's not a way i pray thee from thy servant then we know understand when he did a little foot washing and he made all these arrangements but you know abraham had to have a revelation of who that was my lord translated lord god elohim brother brown said why he met him one time before right the same man that gave him bread and water i mean bread and wine is the same man he met again but he saw three men and said my lord one of them was almighty god this one but look at what abraham come to a revelation that it was a man if it was a spirit folks he wouldn't have went and killed the cow and churned the butter and got the milk and got the bread and fed it to this man god had become so real to him brother callie till it was a man and he knew who that was and he knew that that man could eat what a revelation that you and i must come to the realization that god's going to meet us the same way maybe in a former james colley donnie farber danny fountain i thought we were supposed to be priests and kings right that's right we're not taking melchizedek's place but if melchizedek if abraham did this for melchizedek and melchizedek was almighty god in human flesh we know that it was not a flesh that died for us remember that it was not jesus the flesh man this was god creating himself a body stepping into it and meeting meeting abraham why did he meet abraham because just like brother brown said abraham met melchizedek and then what did melchizedek do watch what melchizedek said let's go over to he says where is sarah verse nine because we know he ate butter and cap and all that stuff and they said unto him where is sarah wise he said behold in the tent he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life now sisters at 90 years old you don't have a time of life you know you have 28 days you know time of life so what's god doing here's god verse 10 i not abraham not sarah i see what they say brother brown said i was the personal pronoun the person was going to certainly return to the according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife she'll have a son i said i heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old they were old they hadn't been changed yet they were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the man of women therefore sarah laughed in her heart saying i am waxed over shall i have pleasure with my lord being old also and did that bother god did that bother god did not go and pitch a fit no he said in the lord saying to abraham wherefore to sarah left shall i but surely bear a child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh and the men rose up since and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that's which that which he has spoken of him now we know for surety what happened after that so we know the other two angels were billy graham and oral roberts the prophet said that went down to sodom and preached to the uh denominational world and the pentecostal now i had a preacher tell me the other day that that he said well well if that was melchizedek then and and we were talking about what melchizedek looked like well melchizedek looked like jesus christ couldn't be no different same theophany same theophany that was you know that was when he resurrected uh mary thought he was a gardener until he said mary when he said mary she said my lord just like what he said my lord see so they knew see let me tell you something i'm trying to get this to you when god is god is is not changing he is he is not changing in what he is if abraham met him that way mayor magdalene met him that way you and i don't have to meet him that way god's not an old man god's a young man god is still melchizedek he's still god of heaven he's still your savior your redeemer your healer prince of peace mighty god but you know what he calls abraham his friend and i really don't like that song i am a friend of god cause i'm not because hey god told you this what he said when jesus betrayed him what's the first thing he said brother gary he's his friend my son back there in the back he's not my friend he's my son that's right he comes from me amen we're not a friend of god abraham's a friend of god because he can't be a son of god but you and i meet melchizedek in the final end and we become son of god a son and daughter of that man standing there he knew abraham couldn't produce me in you that's right amen other danny couldn't produce me and you for that he couldn't produce you he couldn't but he's the father of our faith that we believe that what god did for abraham brother gary god's going to do for us but not being just a friend that's right man sons daughters of god i don't want to be god's friend because judas was his friend do you understand is that too dogmatic i don't want god at the very end to look at me and call me friend that's right i want him to say son you did a good job and what do you think about connecting that connects right here that's right you'll be a friend to anybody you have a dog for a friend you understand what i'm saying that friendship is friendship but family's family i'm a part of the family of god not a friend but i believe in james that we don't have time and james it calls him the friend of god and that's okay but he can't be a son but their bodies were changed and then they had the promised son now let me read one skip to number seven i've got to read this quote right here okay and skipped a lot but i'm sorry two don't go long-winded in my old age y'all need to get rid of that guy amen in the back because listen the son of god was revealed down through seven church ages correct but to take a body change we got to meet a son of man that's why son of man ministry had to come back listen to this we would see jesus number seven now the levitical priesthood ceased at the death of the lord jesus now we live in the melchizedek priesthood christ now we still are not without a uranthuman this is it now the bible see we must stay with the scripture and not put our own interpretation to it just the way it's written no i believe that god will judge the world someday by jesus christ i believe that i believe that there will have to be some standard he'll have to judge by because there's so much representing christ and so many other things he said now let's go to the trial this is a really good one but now unto the gentiles he reveals himself and now the son of god which is the holy ghost everybody understand that the son of god is the holy ghost that's spirit god all right now jesus said as it was in the days of sodom i want this blind prosecutor now what brother branham's doing let me set the stage for it when he went to tampa and preached he put him he put up a trial just like a had a judge jury and and witnesses and all that so what he's doing now he's talking to the prosecutor he's making his case all right but now unto the gentiles he reveals himself and now the son of god which is the holy ghost now jesus said as it was in the days of sodom i want this blind prosecutor to see this he's a blind interpreter of the word always he takes his organizational ideas of it and knows no more about it than nothing he does it to deceive because he's a deceiver at the beginning jesus said as it was in the days of sodom when the son of man is being revealed in the days of sodom was the son that was god revealed in human flesh which was one time called melchizedek the father now that's not confusing either because that's melchizedek that was almighty god standing there that wasn't jesus the flesh standing there that was almighty god in human flesh standing in front of abraham all right melchizedek at that time had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life ever who he was he remains the same jesus said father mother but this man had neither father nor mother and he appeared to abraham in the form of a son of man which is god in human flesh right now the son of god was in that son of man but see the son of god is not going to take a rapture i mean a change of the body forgive me not going to take a change abraham and sarah had to meet melchizedek to get their body changed because that's what that's what he said i will visit you in the time of life i will visit you bride in the end time i'm going to visit you and according to the time of life all right because remember we're all feminist in the bride right and he appeared to abraham in the form of the son of man elohim jehovah the church now has served the term through the church ages in the baptism of the holy ghost but jesus said here to make malachi 4 and the rest of these scriptures real to you that in the last days just before the coming the world setting setting will be like the sodom and the son of man will reveal itself as the son of man like he did in the days of sodom blind prosecutor can't you see that his words are true not nail scars and prints and thorns it's the son of god impersonated in his church as son of man it has to fulfill malachi 4 and the rest of the scriptures i call to the court's attention look at that real good son of man that's what melchizedek god and human flesh met melchizedek and then afterwards you see the body change okay he said what's got to do with us every son of the faith in the final end has to meet melchizedek you say we got to meet a man in human flesh again god and human flesh again just like abraham did yeah what flesh is he gonna reveal his stuff in can anybody say us can anybody the whole point abraham took a journey as abram took a journey to meet melchizedek he met him one time but at the end is when the change took place we but now look abram had to go from abram to abraham we had to be called bride remember brother brown said now i call you bright we had to come to the bride stage because the bride is where you're going to have the son but he's not going to be birthed listen to me he's not going to be born in the end time as a baby he's going to be born four grown man why mature that's right melchizedek wasn't a baby he was a full-grown man and he told abraham he said i'll visit you according to the time of life and you know what we might have that little schniger that sarah had but you know what it happened anyway because god said i will i will not you i will and that's why he had to send a prophet in the end time to point us back to christ not that it was anything we could do not that is anything that we have done but it's christ he pointed us straight to that man melchizedek that's why he said that that preached to it my that priesthood is is eternal you say eternal let's read one scripture i left it off just for a purpose let's go to hebrews chapter 9. i like the word eternal don't you i like the word eternal verse 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands added to say not of this building neither by the blood of bulls and goats i mean goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more nor is he saying i accepted that i accepted the bulls and the goats in the sprinkler of the heifer but how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament that they which are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance for where testimony is there must necessity be the death of a testator melchizedek couldn't die for our sins as great as the man was but he had to become jesus christ to be born in flesh to take away our sin and then he can meet us in the end time in your flesh there's no other way we are not going to see i don't know what people's looking for but we're not going to see jesus christ in human fleshly form until we meet him in heaven we meet him in the air right brothers right sisters but we got to meet him just like abraham did how are we going to meet him he's he's got to be in our flesh there's no other way you say well i can't believe brother donny you better start believing for yourself and forget about him because you're not going to make it because of him he's not going to make it because of you sure we are together we are working together but he's got to work out his own salvation you got to work your own salvation each one of them's got to work on our own salvation with fear and trembling but let's stand listen this melchizedek is not 4 000 years ago right this melchizedek we're talking about is here today that's right and he's not just one person anymore he's in a member body i thought you know i was thinking about doing a little thought on this man melchizedek but this other came up you know and that kind of hit on a little bit last week but melchizedek was not a priesthood melchizedek was not some spirit some spook that met abram no he was a man but that man became jesus christ we can die for you and i see he had all that in his mind he knew that when he met abraham that's why he called him a friend that's why he said you're gonna mess up big boy and you're gonna have problems but i can't get into you in what i am now i can't do it i bottled up in this theophany that i am right here everybody understand i'm bottled up in this guy i can't get out because i made a promise banning genesis that i'm going to have to come through the womb of a woman and die and when i die though it's going to break that cell open it's going to break that shell and then when i do i'm going to have a lot of little priests and kings i'm going to have a lot of little melchizedeks running around here i'm going to have a little almighty god said walk before me and be perfect the only way we can be perfect is to be in him let's power him dear heavenly father we pray lord that you'll come to us lord and if if we're not baptized with the holy ghost lord i pray that you would baptize us now father that we see lord deal we have repented hearts and we have more people that are seeking you father and we should be seeking you more every day but lord seeing young christians coming to the church lord that they really don't know maybe the person yet father i pray that in the stillness of the night that you'll come to them like you did abram and say i am the almighty god i'm el shaddai if you're weak i'll make you strong if you've got problems and heartaches and troubles i'll take care of them because i'm the prince of peace i'm the king of peace the king of righteousness king of kings and the lord of lords you're the lily of the valley and the rose of sharon the bright and morning star all those titles but you have one name that we're all connected with and that's jesus christ father we pray that you would just bless what's been said did it not be taken and be void lord but it would accomplish what is set out to do father give us strength in this age because you told us you told us to draw strength from you like abram did change his name to abraham lord you've changed our name to the bride of jesus christ and not going back to any other name but you lord father i pray that we would each one of us seek you more lord as the day approaches and and the hours getting darker that's when you met abram and changed his name you met him in his darkest time when it didn't look like he was anything lord but you'd already made him a promise he promised that through him and his wife they were going to have a promised son and isaac came through that to that meeting lord you change their bodies back in a pre-figure of what you're going to do to us lord you're going to change our bodies in a moment in the twinkling of an eye lord but father let us know that that son of man is living and alive and well in the bride not just the son of god revelation but the son of man revelation that we are truly god made manifest in in another form called a bride and it's our human flesh lord even reading the other day didn't bring the quote but lord you said that our our flesh even has to be born again lord we pray that you'd just be with us you promised this you said i will and you said you were the great i am and father being the great i am your ever present lord for anything that we need father being he needs here lord i pray that you take care of him bring back the old shell lord that maybe come over some of our eyes lord and may we see you and you may we worship you lord adore and magnify you because it's your great name that we're that we're living under not any other name except in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ bless each one father as we sing and worship you may your spirit come among us in jesus name amen let's sing a song 249 amen do you have a need i oh is i am i pray you're here i am oh is i am oh i am oh oh well but that you know what that gives you a peace is well with your soul you can have strife and trouble and all these things but you know what when it's well with your soul all these other things just kind of shed off abraham did not sit in that tent and go well now i'm 99 my wife's 90 this you know circumstances he could have sat there and give him a hundred circumstances but the reason abraham is the father of our faith he just said okay i'll accept that that's no different that's why he's the father of our faith what did paul say about him we didn't get to it but paul goes over there and says he was strong in faith we see all the things he went through but the journey was nothing to abraham that's right god said it he made the promise and abraham abram walked to abram and abe abram abram walked to abraham abraham went to melchizedek and when they got together promise came abram didn't stop and start thinking about this and then the other oh sure yeah he laughed but you know what paul said paul said he was strong in faith right never wavered why he got the promise folks let me tell you something like me brother mark we're talking about when we get when this thing's finished and over god's gonna give us the prophet said verbatim he said god is going to give us 30 to 40 days he knew we would be looking for who made it and who did it so we're going to be resurrected changed and be around here for 30 40 days god is so gracious brother branham said god's going to let us see who made it and who didn't nothing's going to bother us are you putting that a bomb in your pocket and it's not going to bother you you're immortal but god's gonna give us time to say oh but you're mad sister regina made it right you remember the old story you know they told a joke about the guy that says you know well i wonder why the how this one made it and this made it and he asked the angel he said what are they talking about over there he said well they're over there wondering how you made it abraham believe god and it was imputed to him for righteousness regardless of what happened regardless of what happened in his life it was imputed to him for righteousness we're going to have a wonderful time brother brown said this is going to be the quietest we'll ever be because i promise brother gary it's like a birth it's a hard laborous thing but once it's over once it's over i mean i looked at that picture brother don back there they got a picture we're going to put downstairs we'll never see that old man anymore he's done we'll never see we'll never see tom farbush walking around with a cane anything he'll be out skipping the rest of us but we'll never see that see so what's real is this real real or is that real that's eternal this is temporal that's eternal they're just sleeping they're just going to be asleep for a little while not a problem they're rejoicing they're waiting for me and you to get on our journey move forward from this day forward until satan i'm moving forward amen i'm going forward regardless of what you bring i'm going forward right now i am going to make it because god said somebody was going to make it and i bet somebody yeah that's right you love the lord put some people on your heart get your bucket list out and write them down somewhere write them on your refrigerator and pray for them right you know i've got family members you've got family members what it what what's stopping us to believe believe for him right job believed for his kids and made sacrifices for him but you and i god don't want us to go out and make sacrifices he wants to believe and like sister steven said she wanted to live a life in front of her family so that brother don and her would live in front of their family so that their family would be so hungry that's right that they would want what they got that's right they would want what they got and that's what i did let me tell you something let me give you just a second testimony i wanted what my daddy had right i didn't want to be my daddy but i wanted what he had right because he had eternal life he had one out the way i wanted to act was the way he was acting right now if he was a gruff old man and cursed and run around and drink and smoke and done all that did you want it would you want him no there's got to be an example and then when i come to church you got brother tom he beat you to death brother dean brethren that was around me brother colley that had been steadfast never wavered um geez i can't remember brother colleen dardy brother dardy they were there since i was little kids stonewall standing there i go out come back they're there i saw them when i was here and then when i came back man they must be something to this it must be real to them you know it must be real to him because i see him moving i see him working still in in working for god and doing the things of god well you know what we need examples we need examples find you an example and don't try to imitate them there's a difference in imitating somebody don't imitate i don't want to imitate somebody but you know what if they act like god i don't mind imitating them because you're imitating god you'll see you're acting but see your actions just like that sermon i read you that preacher never said a word he just moved that coal outside it got cold and he took move the coal back inside never said a word the guy got the whole sermon that we need each other right you love the lord thank you everyone that you've been here and be with uh pray for mom and dad i figured they might try to come in but i guess they didn't and uh but pray for them coming back they're surely on the highway if not already home but pray for them pray for him preaching wednesday night and all the things that we got coming up bible study six o'clock saturday and thanks again for for who for everybody that i didn't call a name but everybody that that worked out here saturday and did a just an absolutely wonderful job and
