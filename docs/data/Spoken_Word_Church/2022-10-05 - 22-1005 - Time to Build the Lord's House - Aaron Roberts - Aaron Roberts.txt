Christ amen and haggai chapter one beginning at verse 1 and it says in the second year of Darius the king and the SEC in the sixth month and the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet unto res unto zerubbabel the son of shethil the governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Joshua dick the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you owe you to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have so much and bring in little you eat but ye have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you clothe you but there is none warm but he that earneth wages and he that or if wages are wages to put it into a bag with holes thus death the Lord of hosts consider your ways go up to the mountain yeah go to the mountain and bring wood and build the house because that's the house we're building and I will take pleasure and I will be glorified to saith the Lord you look for much although it came to little and when you brought it home I didn't blow upon it why thus saith the Lord of hosts because of my house that is waste and you run every man unto his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from Dew and the Earth is stayed from her fruit and I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the Labor uh about all the labor of the hands and this is from First Peter chapter 1 verse 2. and it says he also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer a spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated and I was looking at something the other day and foreign looking at some things that brought me to this brought me to this scripture and we know that when the children of Israel they came out of Babylonian captivity we know that they came back and they were given the word to build rebuild the Temple and when we know that uh you know Cyrus was King when he allowed and he allowed when things opened up so they could come back in to build the temple they're actually able to come back into Jerusalem which was there was a promised land when they came out of captivity and when they when they came back you know we know Nehemiah and Ezra were there you know they had a desire to build to rebuild the Temple and were able to do some things and we know that the work was hindered after they started we know that the uh we know from the from the store we know that the Samaritans you know which were a mixed group they wanted to come in and they wanted to help them build rebuild the Temple but you know um zerubbabel in them uh the different ones the elders believe that no it's for us to build the Jews were to build rebuild the Temple because that was what God had given them and that was their work to do not anybody else's and not and not to have a mixed multitude but to have those that were fully Jews they were fully Believers to rebuild the Temple that was their work to bring that back and we know that you know they had a a lot of they had a lot of hendrits to go when we know through the scripture and studying the 70 weeks of Daniel we understand how how difficult it was for them to to rebuild and and the prophecy was given to them how they would have to hold a sword in a trial and they would have to work and look over their shoulders to watch because I always had to keep an eye on the enemy all the time as they were trying to rebuild this thing and it was a struggle for them to rebuild that Temple but they rebuilt that Temple and you know as they were building it and they had a lot of problems and we were reading here and haggai when he talks about when when they had so much trouble but when Darius became king then things opened up some more and Darius helped them with with some things and everything and they had to keep trying to uh energize the people to get to behind the work to do what God had given them to do because we know that God sent two prophets from the from this reading we know that haggai came and Zechariah was the other one that was really the spearhead behind stirring up the people to come back into building the Temple and this is what haggai was speaking of when he's writing the when he's writing this to zerubbabel and Joshua is because when he sees that the people the condition that the people are in and he begins to speak their and he says the Lord says that the people say that it's not time to build the house he said the people say that it's not time but but God is standing there and he's looking and he's saying but you're living in in your nice house you're living in a walled house and he said but the house of God what lays in Ruins and then as you see that you're you're building up things to yourself but you don't see the condition that the house of God is in and then you say but now is not the time to do that and he says then the word of the Lord came to haggai to the to the Israel to speak unto them and tell them he said is it now time he said can you can you say that it's not time when you see the utter ruin of the house of God but the house that you live in is all full of comfort you have all these Comforts to yourselves but you've not spent one dime you've not spent one moment trying to rebuild the house of God when God told you that you were supposed to go back and you know even in the in the chapters chapter two of hagga you know he brings it back to the people and he said who saw the former glory of the house who was the one that saw the first temple and he said remember he said but the word of the Lord come that the second temple would be greater than the first temple the glory of the second one would be greater than the first and yet he kept putting the vision before the people that it's time to rebuild the the house of God and as as Peter tells us we are a spiritual house to be built up to offer spiritual sacrifices unto God and we see how haggai was there trying to stir up the people to get into the work of God because this is the place where God's going to meet you this is what God wants this is what God requires but he tells them said listen he said y'all have have received all these things and he said but you've not taken any time you've not put anything into the work of God you've not done anything to help the work of God and he said you have you have labored but has not come to anything he said you work and all these other things that he talks about here he said everything that you've put your hands to is because of what you've done then when then he says consider your ways why because you've sown and it's all into the things that fill your pocket that that are your that are really just to your own lust to your own desire he said but you've not put anything into the house of God and he stands there and he says consider your ways and he said look he said because all that you've had and all that you've done and everything has went wrong in your way he said listen that's the reason that you're standing in sitting in the midst of a drought right now is because you failed to be at the house of God because you failed to prepare and go forward with the house of God and you know the thing is is you and I are spiritual or spiritual house for God we are we're God's dwelling place and if and not just not just meeting here but it's where you meet God every single day of your life what have you put aside to to meet God and and for God to meet you to have communion and so when he begins to speak I mean it talks about everything thing that they have had their hands to has failed he said he said you desire he said you're trying to eat and you it never comes to knock he said you try to drink and you're not and you're never ever satisfied you never you never you just continually be thirsty he said you're always cold there's everything wrong why because you have failed me why because if you want anything from God then you give God what you have why because if you want God to bless you then you've got to follow What God Says and he says they have gotten to a point where it was just such a terrible condition that they had gotten into that you see that how how terrible everything was around them and yet God was trying to call them back to the work of God they're trying to call them back to build this is the time to build the house of God and brothers and sisters I I wanted to say something tonight uh I'm gonna be a mess tonight but that's all right I'm gonna preach anyway but let me tell you something after the messages the last few messages that we've heard across this Pulpit I I tell you it it it it it there's a reason we have to take a more Earnest tea to what we've heard and not just allow things suggests to be just to be common or everyday kind of things but we've got to have a stirring to change us and who we and change who we are and not just allow it to be another service where we've just come and just heard the word of God and say well brother that was good and then we don't ever change why because what has been preached to us is a is a life-changing message and the thing is if it's not changing you then we need to go back because we've missed what has happened and I tell you where it has something that stirred me why because I have failed God and and and and he just preach on me tonight and that's okay because I need it because you know what I don't want I don't want to be the same Aaron Roberts that come in here tonight I don't want to be the same Aaron Roberts state was here but you're going from a year from now I don't want to be the same Aaron Roberts if I'm the same one that was a year from now and there's no been no change and you know what that I Lord to do something with me because I don't need to be this the biggest problem that I have is Aaron Roberts it's the one I wake up and look in the mirror at every day right and you know there's times you know things are said and you know the brother Branham had had problems with things that that people that because you've got to preach the word the the Five-0 Ministry has to preach the word you're giving you're it just just like all of the prophets the different ones everybody's been given a Ministry and they've been given a part to do and and you know what it's not always fun it's not always pleasant but it's what God has given you to do and when and brother Brandon's speaking in the in the message he that is in you I was I was listening to it today and you know brother Brown is speaking because the message that he preaches right before this and I don't it's not up there but uh one of the the message that brother Brandon preaches right before this is Souls that are in prison now and it begins to preach and you're talking about the condition that the world is in the church is in and how everything is in right now and he's like really because when you start to see us as brother Ryan was talking about when you see that that foolish virgin is coming for all he said realize he said it's already over with when the foolish virgin they're coming to the to the wise with with the old he said realize he said it's all over with because there's no oil for them to receive the old has been cut off there is no going back because when when it comes to the point when they've heard the voice set behold the bridegroom cometh when that voice went forth and to those people when they turned it down they're in outer Darkness there's no way to come back but only those that have the oil are able to go because they were able to rise up and trim their laps and go in and that's the only ones that are going in nobody else is going in and remember when he when he gets into this point and then you know he brother Brown you know he's he's dealing with this struggle because he calls a brother's name and I think brother white mentioned that and he's talking about you know he calls this brother's name and and you know when uh he you know he was so upset but you know brother Brandon when he when he's speaking here in this message you know he said he said you know he said it's hard to imagine what's on a man's heart because you know you're you're trying to do the best that you can but he said you know I realize some people are going to take the wrong slant to this he said they're not going to accept it the right way because a lot of people turn brother around him down but it wasn't what brother Branham was saying because he had it from a from what he said he said it was from a heart of love because he was saying what God had given him to say so he was only saying what thus saith the Lord he wasn't trying to he said I know my my friends are going to turn away from me he said he knew it was going to break churches and all kinds of things all the all the problems that David was going to create but you know what he had something that was down inside him that was burning inside of him you know he said he talked about he carried that burden with him you know he said I would go to the mountains and pray and he said I couldn't get rid of that burden he said I'd go to the seaside and pray and I couldn't get rid of that burden and there was something why because there was something that God wanted him to do and he said he kept battling with that burden but when he began to preach that message then he realized you know that burden lifted off of him and it was something that why because there was something that God wanted him to express and it was so hard right and brother Graham says he said how can you say it without hurting how can you say these things without hurting people's feelings how can you how he said how can you and it not take effect because you know when you say these things he's because he says how can I say it to show the people that I'm not picking on them that you love them how can you be strict and firm and yet be loving he said oh how you're going to present it and then woe unto me if I don't present it see and there you are see no wonder it keeps you nervous and tore up so when brother branham's trying to trying to express something to the people he's not trying to he's only doing what God wants him to do but he's showing it from a way of love that he's showing what the position the condition the world's in this is what's going on this is what we got to do and it's just like he said when you sold those people when the when they're coming to the falls and and there's somebody's in a little John Boat or whatever and realizing they're not gonna they're not going to survive the Rapids they're not going to survive and all you can do is stand out there and yell at them it's not it's not because you're mad at them you're not trying to pick on them he said but it's from a Heart of Love you're trying to tell people the condition where you're at and listen you don't realize what danger you're in you're not going to survive you're not going to make it right and and so when you when you come to that see that then it becomes a very difficult position to be in because you've got to preach the word but you realize people are not going to accept it the way you preach it and then because people when when who was it uh was it Jeremiah that said you know because he had he said well you know I'm just not going to speak the word of the Lord anymore why because everybody turned him down the more he preached the more more he options of opposition that he had the more problems that he had and anybody just said let's I'm not going to speak in the name of the Lord anymore he said I'm just tired of speaking but he said didn't the word of the Lord came to him and he said it was like fire shut up in his bones why because it was something that he had to say and you know sometimes sometimes we get to the point where you know we think well somebody's just picking on me or whatever maybe it's not maybe it's the Lord speaking to you and he's trying to get your attention but the problem is that sometimes as bro as well later later on sometimes our our problem is our stubbornness is our problem is and that's what gets us in trouble because we get hardened by things and we get offended by things and that stops the move of God that's what stops the move of God in our life is because we've gotten offended and sometimes we like to get behind that and we just like to hide behind that little little pet feeling or whatever our little complex and it holds up the work of God it hurt it hurts the family it hurts the church and we don't realize how much danger we are when we have that happen and we don't do anything about it come on now this is this is from the message the blushing prophet and it says listen it says it ought to be the happiest time in the world to the Christian for the Christian times are going to change the old's going to become young oh my death's going to flee away sickness will be no more no more prayer meetings for the sick no more prayer meetings for the loss but God shall come and take the elect from the Four Winds of the earth and Shall Gather them under his own wings and we'll live and reign with him forever in his Heaven O Brother sisters friend of mine if you're not prepared tonight may you be prepared at this hour I give you an invitation to come to Christ Jesus tonight and receive you that's been different you that know that you're not where you should be with God I invite you to the altar with myself I invite every one of you to come here and not only to say but to stay here until God has cleansed your soul from everything that's unlike him until you can go out of here a new person not with a corn plaster own but go out of here with a blood transfusion that purifies your blood and gives you new life and New Hope go out of here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost go out not shouting not dancing not so much them things are all right but they all belong in the church they are they belong in the Bible they are belong in the Bible but what I'm talking what I'm talking about is the Holy Ghost God's love now brother I'm continues out here and he talks about this young man that came to him and he said his mom had a desire to have a have a closer walk with God said I made a man young man he's talking the other day they said oh honey to her boy come here I want you to look I have oil in my hands well I have too it's here I've been sweating now he said I've got all so she's talking about I've got oil in my hand said what do you think of that and the boy looked at his mother and said mother I want to ask you something she just wanted him to pray wanted him to pray that she'd have a closer walk with God he said when it all come in your hand did it take away all your condemnation did it give you a sweet experience with god well no then I'd leave it alone that's it oh the world the religious world the Pentecostal people are all looking for Fantastics the world the educated so-called world the nominational world is looking for some great solution that they can embedder their denomination and get more members a million more and 44. and it continues on about the Nations and everything the Pentecostals he said but it comes by surrendered life to Jesus Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost anything short of that it's wrong now I just you know because it really struck me when I read that because you know it is supposed to be the happiest time in the world for us and let me tell you something about sisters this is the great and terrible day of the Lord and we we ought to be happy and we are blessed above all measure but let me tell you something brother sisters if you're not there if you've done if you're if this is not if you've not as as he was talking to that that son was talking to his mom if you've not had that sweet experience if you've not had a life-changing experience with God then he said you need to come now and come to the altar you know don't need to wait and don't don't second-guess yourself because you know what if something is hindering you if something holds you back whatever it is you know because as brother Dale's always said I'd rather seek God every day of my life and know that I've had it the whole time this then try to guess whether I had it and play around with God and realize I didn't have it and all of a sudden one day I realize I'm on the wrong side because you know what it's a late hour and we can't play with church anymore you can't play with God you don't play with his word right it's time to change it's it so we've been called to that it's a time that we need to understand what needs to what needs to take place because not just not just having an idea or reading books or coming to church or all that kind of stuff but you've got to know that you've got to know that you got to know you've got to have a stake driven down and where where all the storms that all the hell all the devils in hell can't shake you from it you know where you're standing you know what God has done for you you know that your uh Temple of the Living God that's right he said I would he said if it if it didn't bring you to that why because it's so it's so easy to fall into a trap where where people have had some kind of emotional experience where where something is taking place in their life and then they think this is this is it and they drive it down and all of a sudden the next time you you see them they're out back in the world or they're they've Fallen back into the same traps they're saying back into the same thing that they were that they came out of and they're they never can get victory over why because they're going right back to it why because they've not reached the place that they need to that they have not stayed as brothers said you got to stay there until something changes until God until you know that God speaks to you that God has has done something in your life that he has filled you with the Holy Ghost that he's changed your life but many people they've not gotten to that point this is from the message the Queen of Sheba Brothers says you know Faith cometh by hearing talking about it and I want you to listen to some of these he said we don't do enough talking this is number number two so we don't do enough talking about the good things of God tonight the Church of the Living God is is took up too much on talking about television programs some kind of a ball game or something on that order he said we we should be testifying to the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and let your whole life be wrapped up in that because many times people you know they they get so wrapped up in so many other things outside of the word of God outside of the the gospel that when they when you try to talk to people they don't know anything we we've gotten so lacks that we spend more time and it's all and it's okay to have in entertainment it's it's all right to have enjoyment and all those type things but the problem is is we find people that that claim to claim to follow the message and claim to be a Christian and claim to be a believer but you know what they have they have better uh and I have better attendance at the ball game or at Walmart or at work than they do in the house of God now brother Brown said one time he said it was all right to miss work but he said don't miss the house of God but you know there's a lot of people you know they they they they like that little gold star or whatever they get at work you know their little bonus or whatever they get the pat on the back they got perfect attendance whatever whatever you get for having perfect attendance at work but I tell you what you know what this this is a whole lot more important than than being perfect and having perfect attendance at at some at work at a job because your job's not going to last forever some people they sweat and tall and they do everything they can today as as they say people are company people you know they do anything in the world for the company but the problem is is the company don't give you anything in return you know the thing is is you know you can you can give everything that you have and pour your heart and soul into a job and the problem is is the first time they change management you're on the street before you can blink your eyes they don't care you can do everything you can to help people out and the next time you know there's all of a sudden you're pulling four or five knives out of your back you don't get you don't get no respect but people but people are so wrapped up and and working a job no we gotta we got to work to live and all this kind of stuff but you know what it's not it's not the greatest thing in the world working the job ain't gonna put you gonna put you in the rapture it ain't going to get you anywhere all this stuff's gonna pass away this is from the from the message second hand Road brother Brown says he's talking about his his mom he says and now here's it may hurt just a little bit but my mother used to give me when we was poor said we used to eat cornbread and with grease and meat skins and everything you know she said and every Saturday night I know we used to have to take a dose of castor oil he said I can't stand it today my mom used to say I'd hold my notes and Mama it makes me so sick I can't even bear it she said if it don't make you sick don't do you any good so maybe that is with preaching the gospel if it doesn't stir you up a little bit and I'm afraid today that many of us that are claiming great things of God are only carnal impersonations someone else the way they act they act in the way they do and you try to put the same thing on yourself and act that way when Christianity is not a mimic it's a life Christianity comes by birth that when you're born again of the spirit of God and become a new creature in Christ Jesus old things are passed away and All Things become new watch so when he's speaking of these things you know why because they're they're when the word of God why because people get so wrapped up in all these other things that are around us but the problem is is sometimes the word of God has to come and correct the situation and be stirred up by it because sometimes you wonder why why do what people what people are and what's happened to people and why the condition that they're in come on about the about the joke they would and you know I know that's not a place to joke but it you know it illustrates the point but they were talking about the people that sat in the church for so long that when the move of God come come by they just sat there and had sat there in the church for so long when the move of God took place all of a sudden they had a dust storm in the church because all the dust had settles were shaking off the people because they had set in the church for so long they had dust settled on them why because they had never had a move of God why because they just sat there and know that well we just come in and we just sat down and we we just do it we just do our little uh religious ordinance and then we leave but they don't know how but they've not had a move of God and then you know God God can be moving all around them and they don't have no idea what's going on they come in and they walk out the same way and when when the when the brothers have called for for people to come up and you know when like when brother Ronnie and different ones are here and you know when they come and you know the Lord's moving and you know what people just like well they're still they're still sitting there yeah see God God can't God can only move he can only call you've got to respond if you don't respond God can't do anything else right amen but are you building up a house of God a house where God can dwell I got a house that God has pleased in a house that God can be glorified this is from the message a deceived Church by the world President says for God can keep anyone and use anyone that he that will follow after him for it's God's business but when we turn aside oh we turn aside away from the things of God then God cannot use us any longer when we'll walk steadfastly after the Commandments of God then we'll stay in the pages when we stay on the pages of the Bible and worship by the written word worship him in the spirit and in truth of the word then God can use and in any individual but when they take a notion to turn aside from after something else then God cannot use that person any longer so when when God has has a desire to be to use because you know what when God calls an individual into into this Army as as brother Wade keeps telling us you know we're not on we're not on a cruise ship we're in a battleship you know God didn't call us on no Club Med vacation this is a this is Battle this is a Warfare and you know there's there's one thing that that I want to say tonight when when you see the condition that things are in you know brother Donnie and the different ones that have served in the military you know when you go in the military you don't go in there to uh just just to stare at the walls that you've got a job to do right and you know brother Bob said every believer's got a job we've got a part to play we've got something to do you go you go find anybody that's been in this in the Army when you are the military the Marines whatever you've got a job to do they train you to do something amen amen the first thing the first thing that that when you go into places like the Marines the first thing the Marines teach you is how to that you know they want you to realize that you are a fighting machine you are a man of war you are a killing machine that's your first job first thing you've got to understand when you come in here it's no longer I or me it's it's you as a group you work together because there ain't no there ain't no there ain't no freelance going on there ain't no long Rangers everybody's working together and we've all got to come and go they get rid of all that other stuff because you've got to learn how to walk in step with everybody else you've got a job to do and the first thing you got to do is realize the first thing you got to do is understand you're a person of War you're a soldier you're a warrior not a warrior you're a warrior we fight we don't worry God never gave us a spirit of fear he didn't give us a spirit of confusion he didn't give us a spirit of worry he gave us a spirit to fight to believe the word and fight now when he gives us that when we become a soldier in the army of God then the first thing he does is he teaches us how to battle and the first thing you do is you realize you do everything the way the Marine Corps taught you you go to bed when they tell you too and you go to bed the way they teach you to do it you get up the way they teach you to do it everything has to be done their way why because it's imprinted in your mind so when everything that you do has a reputation a repetition everything has a way of doing it so when you don't have to think about what you have to do when you're called upon you just act so what did Jesus tell me he said in that day he said he said take no thought what you'll say why because the Holy Ghost will give you the words to say so how do you get the words to say well he just gonna draw no you need to be in the word you've got to sow the word in so when you learn how to be a soldier then you've got another job you've got to learn how to do a lot of a lot of Marines you know they are they are combat infantrymen right they know how they know how to get off of a ship swim they hit a beach head and they're going to take it over and they lock it down and that's their job and it doesn't matter some people some of them they go in there and they can they can shoot a gun and they can dig a hole and all those type things but their other job is everything else and some people they're plumbers there's people that are Cooks some are medics whatever your job is but there's another job so you don't you just don't sit around and look at the walls there's something that you have to do I was thinking about Amanda years ago that that he's certain he wanted to join during Vietnam he thought well I'm going to get in I'm going to join and get ahead so I don't have to I don't have to go to Vietnam he said I'm gonna go win I'm gonna get in I'm gonna get in a a branch of service I'm gonna stay out of of all of that I'm gonna try to find something that's safe to do and so he went to the Navy he thought hating the Navy's a good easy job it's safe I can I can I can handle this for a few years I'll be okay so he went in he was looking at the list he said I saw the thing where it said cook he said hey I think I can do that I think I'd be pretty safe had a recruiter come by and say hey man you don't want to be no cook he said I got a great job for you he said well I'm listening he said I want you to be a hospital corpsman he said what's a hospital corpsman he said well it's a really neat job you get to hang out with all these pretty nurses in the hospital and then you get to pass out drugs and help a little bit in the hospital and you help these people he said hey I think I can handle that so he signed up to be a hospital corpsman well he got into his training he got through that they shipped him off to Corman School guess what he found out there ain't no such thing as that in the Navy a hospital corpsman or a Navy corpsman is a Navy medic and if you want to know where the Navy Medics end up they get attached to Marine Corps units so he said I spent three and a half years in the Navy attached to Marine Corps units and they said the first thing I got done was got shipped to Vietnam and he said I was the one that was over there bandaging up these guys that had been shot up and brought up and everything else and trying to patch them up he said the person the place that I didn't want to end up is where I ended up right so not you know everybody just don't have some cushy job but there's a job that you've got to do and so when when God has called you to a place God just gives us a job to do and whether whether it's preaching the gospel playing an instrument being a deacon or or cleaning the church or whatever it is or just coming to church and shine in the light and saying Amen to the gospel then that's our that's what your job is whatever your job is and that's what you're do that's what your job is because it's we come here and we and we meet together and we recharge our batteries and you know we praise the Lord and we get we get energized and we make it through to the next service and you know we just Feast on the good things of God but you know when you walk out that door you've got to be ready you've got to be ready to battle God didn't call us to this to be losers God didn't call us to be to be failures what if God if God called me to to this place and you know what then he then if he's already done it then I don't have to worry about whether he's going to do it or not why because if if I have been sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of my Redemption then then tell me what day is that going to be what time is there going to be that I'm not going to be ready that I don't have the blessings of God now I don't have to accept them just as what he's preaching on last time I don't have to go to court I can have the rights to go to court and have a judgment against the devil and having kicked out but if I don't exercise the rights then it's not anything for me I don't get any benefit of it right if God if he's if he's if he took all those stripes upon his back for my healing and then I go in and cry out to God and where will you heal me hey man amen can you imagine that it's it's so amazing it's just like somebody running by holding out holding out a water 100 bills trying to give them to you like I don't I don't know about that well if somebody pulled out if Terence pulled out 100 bunch of hundred dollar bills and had them we know that won't happen but you know that'd be a miracle but anyway God works Miracle spinning me you know if somebody if somebody had that you know then well I I don't know about that that's right but you know God God's not that way so you so you don't trust what God Said you won't trust what God Said well it's like well you know God healed me two or three years ago but I don't know about today and then you come to church and we say well we got a praise report this one's being healed and that one's been healed and this one's been healed and that one's been healed and God moved in this situation they've done all these great things and then we sit there and well I wonder if he'll do it for me yeah cornbread and it's like well the the Bible says that that you know if I if I would just trust him and and I would just try him he said he'd open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing I couldn't contain but I don't know I don't know if that's true or not if you if God said it then why is it that we won't we won't believe it and people say well you know I get in here brother Wade and I get to looking at this stuff and you know sometimes my eyes cross I I get to reading this stuff and I'm so confused on all this stuff and I began to read these things and and it looks like one way and it looks like I I can't figure it out and you know well we don't try to figure it out but you know what I've got a promise in the Bible where he said where brother Branham said he because he said the the spirit of Truth he said how about when he the spirit of Truth is coming to lead you and guide you into all truth it ain't going to be a mystery it's going to be a revelation and brother Bradham said a real true Eagle will understand well then you know what if I'm a real true eagle and he's opened this up to me then guess what that I can understand it he said he said this the Bible this message can be understood by the most illiterate well praise God I'm not there but you know I might be at the bottom somewhere but I may not be that but at least he put me in that in that class you know you know we we see people sometimes and and you you wonder about people and you know because we allow the devil to talk to us and get in our mouth and you know sometimes it's nice to understand because you know you have you have an Understanding God's able to touch you and he's able to speak to you and praise God we we all can read and write you know what we got through it you know High School most of us we got through past the third grade or seventh grade or whatever it was you know I think sometimes when you know I can read I can I can listen I can understand all these things I can look up words and all this kind of stuff and I think about brother Jill Forney he couldn't even read could read it all couldn't didn't know nothing and the Lord come down to supernaturally touched him where he could start reading so he could able to study the Bible and read the Bible and study the message well guess what y'all wasn't that far gone y'all were above that and he worked the supernatural miracle in Brother Jules life that he could do that well you know what y'all don't have that we didn't have that problem well then then if if God was able he was mindful of somebody that had faith that put his confidence in God that he could do that for him well you know what we we should be able to get above that well I don't I don't know well you know what you never you never will until you actually come to the place where you actually realize you know what I'm not going to listen to what the devil has to say I'm going to put my faith in What God Says [Applause] so when we read the scripture then and we pray about it when we read what God says and we pray about it then we realize have the Holy Ghost well I'm just going to hold this right I don't understand this but I know that the Holy Ghost will come amen God God is awesome brother I've said that if you had a question that he's obligated to put somebody behind the pulpit that can answer your question and sometimes it's it's amazing because you're I I've got a little iPod beside the bed I listen to brother Brandon at night and it and it's pretty amazing because I woke up in the middle of the night three o'clock in the morning I hear Brother random start preaching though brother random says stuff and all of a sudden it's like catches my attention when I pull out my phone because I've got the message on my phone I start looking up the quote because I start reading what brother Brandon said because sometimes I hear and I think did he actually say that because it catches your attention and it's like well the Lord's speaking to you and it's like wow that's amazing and all of a sudden you go back and you start reading and it's like hey I got to hold on to that one because that was a good nugget I done something for me and it's just like he speaks to you well you know that's the whole thing is when you listen right right or you read then sometimes you you've read you've read the same thing over and over and over here and it ain't done anything for you you know it may be the fifth time the 500th time you read it and all of a sudden all of a sudden it just opens up and you see everything in a brand new because when you come to the place you read the scripture and it's just like well that doesn't mean it just I lost confused but you know you just stay in the word and wait till it opens that's it you know I I've had scriptures that I've seen that that looks that look so contrary or looks so so confusing and all of a sudden the next time you read them after the Lord opens them up to you you will never ever read them the same way you did before his brother I'm talking about he said you know he said I packed the Baptist Bible he said I read them with Baptist glasses and he said all that but he said when the Holy Spirit came and he opened up the word then it became a new book to him that he could never saw it the same way he saw it before then you can only ever have to see it the same way before that you saw it before you can never see it the same way now this is from the message hear ye him brother Brian says Jesus never gathers his people just to be gathering he said Christ never did anything Loosely and I think that's the problem with the church today we take too many things of God Loosely and now I perceived that this is a Pentecostal Gathering listen if you're my brother's sisters but the Pentecostal people are too Loosely with the gifts that's in the church and that's the reason God can't respect them see you just get them let them go any old way they shouldn't be they should be governed and put in order and then he continues on talk about people speaking in tongues in meetings and everything and he says and so you understand he said then it's confusion how they're working but he says the gift he said the prophets the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophet he said so he said so we we so misuse these things just letting it go freelance that's just as good as the devil would want it to well that's just because if if you get it out of La if you get it out of order that's just as bad as not using it at all because you exactly you've just created all this confusion he said that's right he said them gifts had been set in order and put in place that that have that had been a Revival sweep this land today that's never been exceeded he said we don't lack power we lack knowledge we lack Faith you got power any man that's born again has the whole Heavens the whole Heavens is open to him so the problem is that we don't have we don't lack power he said we lack faith and we lack knowledge and what struck me about that is see when you have all these gifts God has given you a gift so if God's called you into this place of being in a battle being in an army then God has given you a gift everybody has a gift to use whatever your gift is and that you need to find out what your gift is I know and some people's problem is is they don't know what their gift is and they never try to seek an answer to come to a place where God shows them what their what their gift is so they don't know how to operate they don't know what they can do to help people why because they never sat down and stole God about it and so there's a gift of God that's in the body that's not being used and then if we and if we misuse our gifts and we don't operate on the right in the correct manner then we realize he said that's worse than you know that's just that's so good as the devil wants you to do because then it all creates all this confusion he said but we don't like power he said we lack knowledge say you got to have faith to come up that statue of a perfect man to come to the place where you've getting knowledge because there is knowledge in the Holy Ghost but you've got to come to this place where you have knowledge where it's sealed in but if we want it but if we want to be used of God then that's what we've got to do we've got power but we've got to be able to use it and God has and God has more power has more gifts than he wants you to do he has things he wants you to do but the problem is you've got to come to the place where he can use you we've got to come to that place where we're able to be utilized of God to be the living instrumentality of Jesus Christ to be able to be used in the way that God wants us to be used not just to be holding back you know it's just like people collect things and you know you know I worked with a guy one time and and you know he he was a he was a good guy he was smart but you know like the company bought him tools and you know he just wanted he just wanted to see how long he could keep all these tools in plastic yeah it's like he's like well you know he said I I what I want what I want to do is I want to turn them back in when I quit in the same condition I got them in well you ought to quit now then but that's that's but that's people's mentality you know it's just like collecting a bunch of uh porcelain what nots and all kinds of stuff knickknacks and all that kind of stuff got to build up these nice little shelves put all this stuff on where you was it to collect dust and that's I mean that's okay that's okay but what I'm saying is is you know the God God don't give us gifts to hang them on the shelf for us to look at it God damn don't don't give us and you use it because we're giving things to be used to be used of God but also to utilize the things that we have because if God calls us to live in a place of heavenly places then they don't guess what that we live in Heavenly places and we utilize the things that are there but if we don't then you know what it doesn't do anybody any good it's just like people that that can sing and you know some people they can sing but you know what it's like pulling teeth trying to get people to sing but you know you know the people that are that are happy to get up and sing you know what I'm talking about and ain't calling any names but some folks couldn't carry a tune in a bucket but you know what the Bible says to make a Joyful Noise and you know what some people don't like like pops always said he said we're going to make we're going to be somewhere between a Joyful Noise and an awful racket but you know what some people they don't mind doing that but some people they can sing like a nightingale and you'd have you'd have to put dynamite in and blow it up for them to actually get them to move to sing for the Lord you know I told I told so many young people that I've talked to that I see that like our young people and the ones that don't want to have these wonderful gifts and everything like that I said they get up here and they say well I I may I make a mistake somebody listen there's 88 keys on that piano right right so there's 88 keys on that piano right there she she guesses she plays the piano she don't anyway right somebody somebody somewhere along that number I don't know what it is somebody knows I don't but I think that's how many okay you know I mean you know how many how many keys do you how many those things you hit at times sister Esther 10 11. 946 whatever it is that you're hitting out of 88 and somebody's hitting it all of a sudden well I hit the wrong one how many people know that there was a wrong key hit and if you mess up just do like sister Esther doesn't fix everything I love that maybe nobody else in this church does but I I we listen we listen uh Sarah and I we're in the car and coming on Wednesday night we hear her playing the piano sometimes and man she's just going and I hear a rake at that piano man I tell them I say I tell him I said sister Esther's playing the piano I like if I don't do something for you I think your spoons fell out of your bowl so just do it for me if nobody else likes it sister Esther I like it but let me tell you what it does something for me but but I tell them I said listen I said you get up here and there's 88 keys and and how many how many string you got 10 strings on the on the mandolin right yeah okay listen there are six strings on the guitar I know that much I play that I don't know what everybody else knows but anyway somebody on somebody will know there's four there's four on the violin I know that much but you know I mean how many key I mean how many knows you see you're playing a song yeah 200 notes whatever and yeah how many people in here have a perfect pitch and and understand how you hit the wrong note I wouldn't but some people you know they'll play a song they'll get up here and play a song and they'll play and they can play for four minutes they'll play a song for four minutes and the only thing that they get out of that four minutes is I hit the wrong note yeah they don't get in the spirit of worship they get out of that one note and I tell kids I said listen you're not playing for the audience this is not a concert I said when you get up here and play you're playing for God you don't worry about whether whether you hit the wrong note or nothing then you learn you know what because a lot of y'all don't know how many mistakes I've made playing the guitar because most of you don't know how to play the guitar so you wouldn't know if I made it or not thank you Richard sometimes knows when I make a mistake but nobody else does but you know what it's playing for the glory of the Lord It's not trying to worry about whether whether we are yeah and it's good to practice but you know what when you get in this in the church it's a spirit of worship it's not worrying about trying to get every single note right and that's good but when you come to the house of God what are you trying to do are you trying to glorify God because a lot of times people will get and they get into this and they're saying and you'll see them they'll get up here it's like we're gonna want if you were in in your house if you were sitting in your house at the piano and you started to play the piano you've got zero pressure on you and you began to play the songs and all of a sudden you'll feel the presence of the Lord come and you and you'll begin to enter into a spirit of worship in your own house and the only person that's there is you and the Lord and I said you know what that's the same idea when you come to the house of God when you set down to play it's not just to be going through the motions but it's to bring a spirit of worship and then when you realize I'm glorifying God that's what God wants to see and I always tell young people listen don't when you get up here just play for the glory of God because God's the only one that matters probably even because you know everything that we ought to do is to be pleasing unto the Lord not just not just trying to do things because you know we're trying to impress somebody that doesn't do any good so when you come up here play play for the glory of the Lord sing for the glory of the Lord raise your hands and if you can't if you can't hold up one you know both hands just hold up one for a while and then swap to the other one and if your hands get tired just go like this window you're tired but it's okay raise your hand if you just swing your arm you put it back down right it's better than just sitting there looking like this I understand some people come in and and boy I tell you what them them pews they'll move on you because they're holding them down all the time [Laughter] thank you but you know when we come to the house of God you know I see I see people you know what they'll get out and they they can work and I I got I got guys that I work with friends and I tell you what they can get out and they can work in the yard they can I mean sweat just all kind of work but you know what they they can't uh don't set them down they're useless and you and it's like it's so amazing when you when you when you work I mean you can do but you can't come to the house of God and you can't raise your hands brother you can't clap your hands let's let's pull them engines apart and do all kinds of stuff but you know we come we all we ought to put we ought to put a little bit of emphasis on what we're doing when we get here [Applause] but sometimes you know we don't realize when we come here we just well we're just back in and doing the same thing no we're meeting with we're meeting with God he gave us he gave us his all he gave us our his best that we ought to give us give him our best and we ought to give him our all that we have no brother I'm speaking here in the in the message the leading of the spirit and he was speaking of the of the Magis and he says he said and they watched the stars in every city and not one of them ever saw it speaking to all the cities that when he when they were going everybody between there and Bethlehem nobody saw that star all the way to Jerusalem when they when they came to see here when I got to see here nobody saw that they come all that way and the Magis followed all the way from India Plum into Palestine why didn't they see it he said the reason people can't see the Glorious things of God today they're not looking for them that's the reason it's only given to those who are looking for it those major I had what had watched balaam's prophecy when he said there'll be a star rise out of Jacob they knew it and the way things were shaping up it was time for it to happen and you can tell amen he said but listen here here it is listen you can tell we're at the end of the road Atomic bonds Cobalt hydrogens the Nations it's trembling fussing the great enemy hanging Yonder with jet planes that could blow this nation to Pieces yes the whole world in five minutes time everybody's nervous well that was 1955. it's the same thing today in 2022 but why but here here are those people they saw what the prophecy the Mage I saw what the prophecy was and brother Bob said how people didn't see the things of God is because they weren't looking for it but those people brother I've said they got up every single day and and every night they studied the stars and had wrote down everything that had happened all the changes I knew where every Star was supposed to be and what would take place and they knew by the by the writings by the prophecies what was going to take place so every time they got up there or looking they were looking to see what was anomaly what was something different when they saw that tight place and they saw that star rise up out of Jacob then they knew that was a prophecy to be fulfilled and they started heading that way and look like I was it caused a reaction because it moved them because they saw something well the same way if you had seen something and then it doesn't it doesn't move you then you really didn't see something he didn't change you because if if you see actually see something that it's a life-changing experience then you've got to move but people don't see those things brother I'm speaking he's speaking here in in the message the uncertain uh I'm sorry be certain of God and and he was speaking of Ahab and he was talking about the condition that the world had gotten into and right right before here brother Brown was speaking hey speaking of coming to God and and leaving God and and realizing where you've come to and where you where you are today and brother I'm speaking and he starts talking about the chaplain that come to the soldier and he asked the soldier when he was in there and he was laying dying on the ground and the chaplain come to him and he said son he said where did you leave God he began to talk to him about it and he kept looking back he said Son you don't have a lot of time he said Now's the Time to understand where you've left God he said you need to understand where have you left God where where was it and he said at that moment he said then he said he began to say now I lay me down to sleep well because he left God as a child and that's where he left God but he had to go right back to that place to find God where he left him and he said as he was laying there dying he began to pray and he said that's what then he slipped off because he'd come back to the place and he said you've got to know where you come to and he begins to talk about this the condition that we're in and he begins to talk about Ahab and he said all these things had long left Ahab why because Ahab but left God why because he got so wrapped up in his ancestral idolatry that they had gotten the Kings of Israel had gotten away from all of the precepts and all the laws of God that they had come to and that's exactly what they have done because he just walked in the in the way of his fathers now he had done all these things and he just said well I'm just doing what everybody else has done and all of a sudden he marries Jesse Bale and he gets all twisted up in that and then he he ends to talk about how Jezebel tried to put the uh come out there was twisted before Jay Hugh he said you know she got he said after her husband was dead she dressed herself and twisted out before jehu thought she could Vamp the the man of God and said throw her out the window he said if we had more men like jehu today we'd have less Jezebels but that was her nature and she was a worshiper of idolatry and she thought the whole and she brought the whole nation to idolatry and so has our modern Trends today falling from falling away from the things of God and has brought the world to one of the greatest idolatries that we have that's idleness just idling Away Great is the iniquity of the people today making plenty of money and think that God's blessing us because he's prospered us that's no sign of God's blessing not at all a lot so many people you know they get wrapped up in their own things but they they have this great Idol and it's idleness where they don't do anything now yeah well I go to work and I come home and I I out all these things but you know what they don't do anything for the house of God they don't do anything for a spiritual walk with God and great is this idolatry why because they well you know we're just doing we're just keeping up with the Joneses and and we're doing all these other things but they're not doing anything to put anything toward having a spiritual walk with God and so they've they've missed out all these things because they've not continued on with what God has called them to God's speaking to them and then he then it's this is from the message here again brother I'm says he said speaking of the tutor and he's speaking of the Holy Ghost he said now the tutor had to report to the father all that the child did whether it was good or bad the tutor had to give a correct report and the father seen that it was his tutor would be a little wishy-washy sort of a guy and his son would be doing wrong he'd be afraid before the father to say that his son was doing wrong he had to be the right kind of tutor a real just and honest man he looked for that type of person to put over his child and it's all together a beautiful type of God our Father sending to us the church the Tudor the razor the Holy Spirit God found the best tutor that there was in heaven to put over his church the Holy Spirit not some intellectual being that's just got a lot of Education more than they got a lot of Education to know how to control it and the charge was not to be raised on intellectuals not but it was to be tutored not by denomination but it was to be tutored by the Holy Spirit that's God's tutor and what do you think that the tutor would do to come before the father and have to tell him how his children was progressing I sometimes wonder how the Holy Spirit must spill to go to the presence of God with the character of his children today who we who call ourselves Sons and Daughters of God how he must like the prophet of gold blush in the presence of God how the church has become so indignant about the things of God how they go off on little tantrums and don't even notice the word of God remember the Holy Spirit Will tutor the children by the direction of the book of the father that's the word God will raise his church by the word and the Holy Spirit will teach the church the word not the catechism not the roles of the church but the power of the word of the Living God the holy spirit will give that to the church did not our blessed Lord say man shall I live by bread alone but by every word the proceedeth thou the mouth of God that's the thing the holy spirit will teach and when the Holy Spirit teaches unadulterated Holiness before the Lord how do you think the Holy Spirit deals to bring the word before the father that were selfish that were unconcerned will stay home on prayer meeting nights to watch the old religious programs uncensored with dirty jokes and everything and then calling ourselves the Church of the Living God what do you think he thinks tonight amen can you imagine the Holy Ghost having to look at people's lives and understand that he has to give an account to tell the Lord what what the people are because you know he said when they was a tutor when a man had a son he wanted to raise him up he gave him the best kind of tutor will he give us the the best the Holy Ghost but he came to raises but you know what you don't have to follow the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost gives you the way to go but you know what it's up to you to follow him and you don't and you don't have to follow it but you know what just remember when you decide hey I'm not going to follow the holy ghost or I'm going to do my own thing or it's okay to do this or whatever you know we get we get a little bit lags on everything just remember you're gonna pay for it there's always there's always a pavement that's got to be made he said listen he said you know we're taught by the word of God to be raised by the word of God and he said how can how can the spirit and the the Holy Spirit he said when he says that we're selfish and we're unconcerned when we're selfish why because you know the Life of Christ is not a selfish life you can't live you can't be selfish and Live the Life of Christ because when when Christ came then he you know everything he said he said I don't do anything the son can do nothing in himself except what he sees the father do they do what the son likewise well you know that'd be kind of hard sometimes if we sat down and we started looking at the way we live our life sometimes the way we speak to our children the way we speak to our wives the way we speak to our boss sometimes the way people wait till we react the way people say things to us and say how how's that pleasing to the Lord would the Lord do that would that be the what and then it's like you know something well I don't I don't want to I don't you know I I just gonna do and do my little part no sometimes when God calls you to do more people don't want to respond to that well I don't want to get out of my comfort zone I'm I'm okay over here no God calls you and sometimes he wants you to get up it's like well why am I going that way well it's just like Abraham when God called Abraham God called Abraham up and said listen I want you to leave your family he said I want to want you to follow me come out here go to a place that you've never been before I want to show you take you to a place he's like well I don't know where I'm going well guess what you just follow me because I'm gonna lead you and they started out walking and all of a sudden he couldn't even he couldn't even follow the directions that God gave him to begin with because he had to take lot with him and God didn't tell him take Lord told him go himself you got to separate from your family and what happened it let he went on down the road and after so long then he had a had to blow up with with lot and all of a sudden they had all the herdsmen were fighting and they had to split up why because it wasn't for Abraham to be there he had to get had to separate from what God calling him out his own way so when God calls it he's got a way for us to go sometimes you know we don't understand why we have to go certain ways but that's what God has us to have faith you got to have faith in what God's doing and not realizing that you know I I used to drive I used to drive me crazy when I was when when the boys were little because you know they they played 20 questions and as soon as you get to 20 questions I got 20 more questions I want you to answer they're always questioning everything and it's like listen it's not for you to know just do what you're told when you get there we got things to do besides us standing here answering all your questions just do what you're told because you know what they want to have the answer before they do something well God sometimes we want to we want God to give us the answer before we do something and God's trying to tell us you just need to walk by faith you just need to walk forward don't keep asking questions about well why while Lord I'm just going to put it in your hands and realize you're going to take control of it so I can just walk I'm just going to continue to walk forward because that's the best thing for me to do brother Brown says he said now he said no every person thinks of their children this is from message the way to have Fellowship he said now every person thinks of their children he said while they're under your wings you watch them but once out from under the wings then the devil's got every little Oscar he can out there to associate with your children that's infidelic I mean the evolution everything else God help us the juvenile delinquency here in New York Chicago and all these big cities once the papers is writing up how they kill one another and everything the little children little boys girls killing and murdering shooting and so forth like that if those poor little kitties only realize that that's the devil sure he said what brought on juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency the parent failing to take care of their children he said continue his own he says he said I remember the doctor told my wife said just let that kid squall said it ain't gonna hurt him and if his grandma comes along to pick him up and take it take her hands off of him he ought to be crib broke at six months he says now you know better than that sounds like a talking of a witch doctor instead of a real doctor and then you know what it hatched out it hatched out a bunch of neurotics and a bunch of gangsters listen God gave you that child of love I don't care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow that's right love it if you don't love it now it'll grow up in a cold home and indifferent and it'll seek love somewhere else or something it'll be out an out light for some for somewhere mother take that baby and give it fellowship and love now make it a part of you which it is act like it and hug it and kiss it and love it don't be too cold with the things of the world God gave you that as a treasure raise it right amen notice that's what's the matter we got away from the things of God you get away from nature then you're out of the will of God you know you know many times because people you know they have all of these books and all these self-help books and you know it's so funny because you know people have spent millions of dollars buying books and all these people Dr Spock and all these other ones that have written books Dr Dobson and everybody else trying to teach you how to raise your kids and you know and you know everybody's got everybody's got to write a book and put it out and it's it's Dr this and doctor that and it's like you know and sometimes when you get down and you start studying what they got it's I mean Dr Seuss is a better is a better book than some of these doctor books and Dr Pepper is better than some of these books but I mean but people people put all of their of their life into these books that this is going to help them raise children but the problem is is God give us a book on how to raise children but the problem is is people don't realize that it's a book to raise children that's right hey God give us a way to raise children and he said we get away from the things of God he said then we're out of the will of God why because we don't look where God tells us to look what God has given us a way to raise kids and somebody you know and you know it's like all the time back you know it was always well you know um they they didn't want they didn't want uh mothers breastfeeding because they come up with formula and it was so much better and when they were trying to sell all this and then coming to find out you know what what God made was better than what God what man made amen all right amazing how that God created something and a man tried to spend years there trying to make something trying to doctor something up to sell to people and come to find out what God done in the beginning was the best hey people well that's shocking but that's what people done they trying to find a better way to do something not realize that God's already made the perfect way God has the most perfect way and you're not going to be able to find a better way than the way God made it great this is from return in Jubilee he said brother says today we have preachers ethical educated fine Scholars turned out can stand up and never move never mess a hair mess up a hair never sweat a drop and just stand there and speak and oh give the articles of the church and everything just so pretty for 15 minutes while you're sleeping go on back home and you call yourselves Pentecostals he said brother what we need is we need an old rugged Backwoods preacher that'll come with a pair of overalls on and hit the pulpit Hallelujah Anointed with the power of God he won't preach for five minutes till the spirit will take the church and it's gone the rest of the night up into the heavenlies he said it's eagles they won't Peck around on the Barnyard stuff they'll go up into the heavenlies for their food he said the sounding of the trumpet yes sir he said return dispersed but you've but but if you've sold your inheritance if you sold out and done these things what am I what am I saying return back if you joined up with some cult that tries to keep you away from the fellowship of other Brethren leave the thing this is Jubilee amen he said I feel religious return return this is jubilee don't let it pass by remember don't let it pass by he said if you sold out if you've went out in the world if you've sinned you know that you once had the experience you went and joined up where you can't fellowship with the rest of them you've done all these things I don't care what you've done if you're a son you have a right to return now because it's Jubilee it's Jubilee time but if you've settled back into a wall somewhere put your name down and anchored got all chickenized there isn't going to be much to happen to you cause you'll never hear it you'll you'll walk out and say well I guess it was all right I've heard that before see go home sleep it off get up the next morning he said but conviction you don't sleep off the word of God you can't shake off if you're an eagle you've caught something so let me tell you something brother sisters if you come to the place where you feel like well I've got a way and then some of these things that have been said tonight you say well Lord help me because that was speaking to me well then let me tell you something then it's time for a jubilee and you realize I've gotten away from God well let me tell you something now's the Jubilee and brother Branham says to return return Now's the Time to return back wherever you are and you realize you're not where you need to be you're nowhere I used to be then come back Now's the Time why because you've heard the trumpet the Jubilee trumpet tonight you've heard the gospel trumpet tonight Now's the Time to come back Now's the Time to come back return amen let's return back let's have the musicians come let's come back where God has called us if God's called you if you've heard that he's speaking here brother says he said one day the old Mammy was hunting he was speaking of that eagle in the chicken yard and there it wasn't and he said realizing she was into he was in the chicken yard one day that old Mammy hunting for him must have been the Year of Jubilee for this little fella the old mother come over and she screamed it looked up and said that sounds right he heard something she said son you're not a chicken you're an eagle come out of it said Mama how do I get out said just flop your wings that's your god-given deliverance you're born an eagle you've got an inheritance come on uh come on up higher get out of that stuff return back he made four or five flops and when he did he sat right down on a post in the yard right in the middle of a Pentecostal organization say perfect exactly what what he said so he was still in the chicken yard right in the middle of the Pentecostal organization he said son he said you've got to have you've got to jump higher than that or I can't get you next jump he lit on his Mammy's wings and went on up into the heavens that's the call of the day brother return back you're not chickens you're an eagle return back yes sir now we know that it's true amen let's all stand this evening now we know that it's true he was speaking of those Eagles hearing that here if you if you've gotten away from it but you know what God's calling you back to your place God has called you back say well I I don't I don't know how to do it just flap your wings just set your wings little eagle and fly amen you were born for the the heavenlies you weren't born for the for the valley you were made for the sky God wants us to go up a little higher than where we are today this is this is the this is from as the eagle stirs her nest and he was speaking to he said remember the first time God ever spoke to you Oh Glory going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you just might as well get started now Omar when I first heard his voice it spake like many Waters but oh my by the Brook and stream where they're a Rippling stream so he can lay down bathe look up my he looked up and said what was that she come back over said honey you're mine you don't belong in that place anyhow he said come out from among them big he separated saith the Lord touch not their unclean thing and I will be your God to you I'll be God to you you're a son you're you'll be son and daughter to me see you don't belong to her that old organization see the days of Miracles past your mind your ego oh that sounds good he said I understand that kind of talk yes sir why he was an eagle to begin with he was actually an eagle just got in the wrong Nest that was all I hope I don't hurt you Brethren I'm just telling you the truth that's right many of them today is in the wrong nest yep many times we get in the wrong nest why because we're not in the place that God wants us to be but we hear the word and God's calling us out of that where they wherever you're at God's calling you up he said oh in the wrong Nest huh mama is that what happened yeah you're my mama yes I'm both father and mother sister brother I'm all and all to you that sounds good Mama now mama what must I do said I tell you honey the way you you got to do you just got to jump you got to jump you got to jump and get your feet off the ground and then just go to flapping them little wings of yours just flap them as hard as you can you can rise cause you're an eagle see you've got long feathers fly just jump off the ground and start flapping your wings real hard I'll get you he jumped up this little Eagle coming up coming out of them denominations and give a little great big flap four or five times and let right on a barnyard post right in the middle of a Pentecostal denomination he said you can't pen you can't denominate Pentecost and all that all denominations he said mother come by here and said mama ain't not doing good look there I am now mama she said Sonny you're going to have to jump higher than that or I can't get you there she stooped down again she he throwed his little feet up in the air and began to flop his wings as hard as he could and the first thing you know he felt something being lifted up up till he struck the milky white way amen then he could fly himself after he got high enough he could fly himself brother that's what the matter with the church today it's never raised up high enough just to get out of an organization it or or something another to find out whether it could fly or not how do you know you can't fly use your wings Hallelujah jump into it go to flapping your wings and find out Jehovah will catch you I will bear You Up On Eagle's Wings amen and so I want to say to you tonight how do you know that you can't fly have you jump have you tried have you flapped your wings another thing is is don't just try it a few times but keep flapping your wings as hard as you can and whatever the battle is you just press on as hard as you can not just go halfway but continue to press the button why because God is wanting us to build up a house that he can be glorified in and that's what we are to do we are supposed to be the end the moving living instrumentality of Jesus Christ set your wings and fly yeah why because the wind of the holy spirit is moving but are you going to set your wings and fly how do I tell you something about sisters I have I had a I've had a moving tonight and it stirred me I will I want to see a movie that we've never seen before in this church I want to say a moving of the Holy Spirit I want to see things happen that's never happened before I want to see uh the word open up like it's never opened up before why because because the world is getting in a worse condition everything's starting to fall apart everything's going down but you know what the word of God is getting greater and greater and greater God has continued to call us up higher God bless you tonight amen let's sing us home amen you go bless it is Jesus Is Mine oh what a foreign [Music] Nation purchase of God [Music] born of his Spirit washed in
