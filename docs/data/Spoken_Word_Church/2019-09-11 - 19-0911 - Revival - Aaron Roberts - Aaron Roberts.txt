you have your Bibles we're going to look in Psalms 138 and then we're gonna go to book of Hosea in chapter 6 appreciate the Lord and his blessings on us I feel like I've been on a merry-go-round I feel like I just keep going going going and like sometimes you want this thing to stop or slow down a little bit but I appreciate all the prayers I know I've definitely failed them and definitely need them it's nice to know when people even sometimes it's people out of the blue you don't even know you know there was a saying was on a sign and it said if we knew if we could see in that other realm when we pray what takes place we'd understand the scripture that says pregnant out ceasing because we wouldn't ever want to see you know we think that you know we're our own our little little sphere of the world certain things are going on just our day-to-day lives or whatever but you know it's nice to have somebody come by and tell you hey thinking about you praying for you you know and sometimes people don't even know what's what you're going through what you're dealing with but you know it's it's nice to have somebody you know just gives you a little glimpse you know God's mindful of you know Withington that you're going through so we're just gonna pray and then we'll just read this Heavenly Father we thank you for another time Lord to be in your house and Lord we just pray that you just coming Lord help us get out of the way the Lord just anoint the speaker and the hearer tonight or Jesus or just come and move in a special way in in our midst and help us Lord and what we're just so thankful for all your blessings on this Lord Lord how many times over we don't realize all that you've blessed us with Lord how you've come on the scene and we just thank you for it Lord and Lord for each need that's represented tonight Lord each one that spoken unspoken Lord Lord you know what we have need of Lord and there's there's people that that need prayer and they sometimes the Lord we forget who they are or what they need is Lord but you know what the needs are Lord we just don't Lord well we just want to be mindful of them Lord that you just come on the scene and lord your bride around the world Lord those that are listening in both by the Internet Lord Jesus I pray that you bless them Lord help them and all we just commit all these things to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen we had Psalms 138 and it says verse seven says though I walk in the midst of the trouble thou shalt that will revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me the Lord will perfect that which concern if me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands and into the book of Hosea book of Hosea chapter six very familiar reading and it says come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight there shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning he shall come unto us as the rain as the flatter and former rain unto the earth amen god bless you tonight you may be seated I want to speak on this and Webster defines revival as an actor instance of reviving the state of being revived such as renewed attention or interest in something a new presentation or publication of something old a period of renewed religious interest and often highly emotional evangelistic meeting or series of meetings restoration of force validity or effect such as to a contract and then continued own revive which is that state of being revived revived means to restore to consciousness or life to restore from a depressed inactive or unused state to bring back or to renew in the mind or memory and that's what I want to look at tonight where it says to renew in the mind because Romans 12:2 says it says but being a bee I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and just just laying up a little bit of background here this is from questions and answer 1957 and brother branham's talking about Israel and he said and he shows Israel and he says did you know that that Jewish flag is the oldest flag in the world and it's been laying dormant for 2,000 years more yeah about 2500 years a Jewish flag that 6-point Star of David never flowed for 2500 years since the carrying away of babbling and now because the Rimmer Roman Empire took them over and the Messiah come and they rejected it and they was scattered to the four winds on the earth but did you know on May the 6 1946 that flag come back over Jerusalem again did you know on May the 7th 1946 the angel of the Lord appeared to me the next day up here and sent me into the world to bring forth a revival for the very next morning when that flag raised in Jerusalem as the going down of the Sun that afternoon the angel the Lord appeared here in the United States at the same time when you see the fig tree and the rest of the trees putting forth brother Branham continues on and he says how many remembers this is continuation of questions answers brother I says how many remembers the the star going down here hanging down here at the Ohio River many years ago when he said here's a picture of it here yet when he come down and said your message will go forth as a forerunner for the second coming just like John went forth as a forerunner for the first coming and look around the world has swept the revival tens of thousands times thousands and thousands and a great revival and he said all the legalists and all the different ones around all over the world in the big churches you know said the Billy day Sunday days are over but when they sing the church began to revive the common people they had to save there they had to save their face Charles fuller would have taken the place but he was too old and they went with Billy Graham and God took Billy Graham where the method or the Baptist Church did and they did all and they all got around him and Billy Graham's not half the preacher that brother Neville is so as far as being a preacher no no by no means but what is it they had to do it it's organism and everything right around it gathering around Billy says the same thing see they had to do it and it had to be done to fulfill the Word of God they didn't have the spirit to rally around so they had to take the word to rally around so they did and Billy's a word preacher and a dandy and they rallied around so that put all the cold formals in their rally and the supernatural being this divine healing and powers and working and so forth by the miracles of God put this the church the rapture bride here that's got the all in her lamp put her in a revival seat and the cold formal church had its revival and here's Israel turning with their revival so we're looking at a revival and you know many times we talk about the bride's revival but I wanted I wanted to see I want you show that everybody's got a revival everybody's having their own revival and the revival is for the different groups whatever group you're in because the word has come to each group and as we were reading here in the scripture you know God promised the word to be revealed and there was going to be a revival take place and it was he was speaking of a prophecy but you know each one of each group has their own revival but you know the thing is is you know why do we have as brother Matthew was speaking saying why do we have the things that are taking place why because the word has to be full filled and so there's a word to everybody you know the thing is is people act like they're not that they don't understand what's going on but you know what it doesn't matter where you at or what you're doing you're gonna fulfill a part of the word you're going to fulfill a part of the word for your day because there was a day because just like he was he was speaking see when the Holy Ghost came there was a message coming in the end time that was going to that was going to be fulfilled because all of the prophecies in the scripture was speaking of the word coming to Israel and Israel coming back that fig tree is going to blossom again and all those place but see that was speaking one because it was spoke of that God was had not turned her away from its whatever that he was coming back to bring the word back to him but there was a bride in the last day that was going to receive a word he was coming back to speak to an endtime group that he was going to make known those things that were that were spoken of in the scripture but the thing is just like the reason I wanted to read that scripture or the Rideau quote from brother Branham because he talks about there was a group that was on fire that had the Holy Ghost that had the oil in their lamp that was given for them for that day that was the endtime bride to had to receive a revival but there was a still a group out there that was just normal and dead and powerless and lifeless but there was a word for their day and that's going to be their revival but because we see that as brother Brennan was speaking of we see in the end time that we know what was going to take places the World Council of Churches and they're all going to gather together the tears are coming together one because that's their fulfillment of their word that's the word that God spoke them because they're not going to receive the true word they're not going to receive the life of Jesus Christ they're not gonna say receive the word for their hour because God come and he spoke to him but you know what it's not because God didn't make it known to him it's because they rejected it and you know what it's the same for you and I God has given us the word but it's our opportunity it's our right to reject it or accept it God has given us that opportunity giving us that privilege and so it has to be do you are you under the revival of this message are you just going to be as a revival or just them just rallying around and just being lifeless and powerless and many people you know it's it's not just the denominations but it's the denominational spirit that's inside the message today why because people if you don't have if you don't have the place the place to stand if you don't have a short foundation to stand on if you don't have a revelation of the word a word you're supposed to stand then how are you supposed to go anywhere well because there's so many that are they walk in darkness they're so afraid they don't know what to do and the problem is is they don't know how to release the hold on themselves and just allow the Holy Spirit to get ahold of them and really just turn it over to God and allow God to do a work in their life well because there's so many people as brother Bram said it's it was all cold and formal it's all intellectual and there's so many people that that is all it's wrapped up in this message it's cold formal intellectual listen and you know the thing is is is you see people and you know they want to study the the message and listen to the message but you the thing is is there there's so much of it that people have had to lay aside because they can't they can't walk walk the same way that they're walking today and hold to the word but see that's what you have to take is to receive all the word take all that God has for us in this hour you know because it's so said that you see all the things that have taken place and all the things that God is trying to do and make yourself known and I believe he did and through a prophet that he made itself and opened the word but the thing is is you've got to come before God and ask and pray for Revelation and yeah the thing is is how do you how do you pray for Revelation you know because the one thing that you've got to do is you've got to understand I don't know it you've got to come to a place it's just like when you come to a place of salvation you've got to realize that you're lost you got to come to a place that you've got that you can't do anything for yourself and somebody's got to do it for you well because you know what we can't save ourselves we can't do anything for ourselves why because we are so lost and alienated from God and separated from God God has to do something in our lives you've got to come to a place and realize you know that you're a sinner and God is the one that come to save you you didn't come seeking God he come to seek you and he come to save you and he come to bring you to his life to bring you to eternal life and if he's coming to bring us then then you know we gotta understand it takes God to do that and you know the thing is we've got to come to a place that just like just like when Jeremiah went to the to the potter's house and he said you know he saw that clay being put on the wheel and the wheel began to spin and the Potter had total control over the clay and he didn't have to you know the Potter wasn't worried about the clay why because that he knew what he was going to do he had it under control he had know what he had in his mind and the thing is is the Potter had had to do the work but the clay had to stay there you know it's the same way with you and I we wonder how God's going to do something in our lives well you know what if we just stay on the wheel and you know way we allow him to do the work and we quit trying to figure things out on our home and worry about things then you know what he can do the work in our lives but we have so many people today they're so concerned about other things and you know and I'm just I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say it because you know you see these people and they live in a world of fear it's a world of fear that people live in one because they're so uncertain about things and they don't understand things and you know what Jesus is the answer to all your questions but you know the thing is is people they get to this one place but they can't understand that it takes a ministry you know you see these people and and y'all probably know what I'm talking about but I'm just gonna go ahead and say it there's there's people that in this world and in and around this message and they want to listen and they won't brother branham to be the one that's going to lead them and they can't realize that it's going to take flesh and blood it's going to take a five fold ministry it's gonna take men with faults and failures and human frailty and God's gonna speak through them and he's gonna speak the word of redemption to them but the problem is as they can't they can't not trust that God can do that and you know brother Reynolds said God men is always always looked back and so praise God for what he done in the past and he said what God's gonna do in the future but they're missing what God's doing right now God why because right now is God God is moving right now is God's revival on the bride the bride is having a revival but people don't realize that why because you know what it's not a show it's not known to the public if it doesn't take if it's not if the Holy Ghost doesn't show it to you then you're what you'll not see it but you're there so many people and then and you know and another case is is you know it takes it takes each individual person having a experience and experience on their own a personal experience they've got to have a personal revelation for themselves because if you don't it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter if you were related to brother Branham or not he doesn't really matter who your pastor is it doesn't reminder who your mom and daddy are they don't matter what you've done in this world and all the great things the thing is is if you've not had a revelation if you've not had a birth of your own to put you in the body so Jesus Christ can come and live in you and lead and guide you it doesn't really matter they tell you the world's full of religious people this message is full of religious people I mean it's overflowing with religion but the problem is is there's no life the thing is it takes people to come on the scene and you know because you know if we could see right like that little say that if we could see what's taking place then you know what it would drive us more to that you know we would have a desperation to get to that as brother brown said if we could see what's going on right here today and see the angels of God here ministering you know they're sending a descending to you to bring you the word to forgot to use flesh and blood to come to you and open your eyes and speak to you then you know what then we would have more I have more time for it we it would be a higher priority well because many times and see that's what Satan has come to do he's come to take up all your time to get into your mind and hinder you and the problem is is you've got to overcome that you've got to fight that because if you're not fighting that then though Devils winning pasilla takes it takes a everyday battle every day you get up but if you realize and you have to go back it's like David you know David had to encouraged himself in the Lord why because sometimes that's the only person that's around is you and you know what you got to dig in the word for yourself and find a holding place and get your own revival and all of a sudden you know what if the word comes to you then you know what if and nobody else is going through then you know what there's a revival taking place in you you know that's the reason that when Daniel Daniel went to the window and you know they said you can't pray you can't pray to your God you've got to pray and do our form and our religious program you know Daniel said he didn't matter he had it had his own plan and you know what the next day he done exactly the same thing he's ever I always done he didn't change his plan he didn't change the way he done everything you know he didn't he didn't sneak around and say well they won't find me up here on top of the house her in the basement or someplace you know he went to the window and let everybody know why because you know what if something stirs inside of you then it's got to be manifested just like the just like that Samaritan woman you know brother Ram said did you know you know Jesus coming and was speaking to her one day and you know what through her testimony said the whole city had a revival and that's what it takes and here in in Hosea chapter 6 it says after two days he will revive us in the third day he will he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight he says then we shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as in the morning so after you are revived then you know what you must continue on to know the Lord because people you know his brother bran was saying you know the Pentecostals they had their revival but they didn't realize there's a further manifestation of the word there was a furtherance of the word and you stop and they stopped but he said you know now you must continue on because you know what there is a greater thing to continue on he said then he shall raise up and we shall live in his sight and we'll get into that a little bit later but we shall know and follow to know the Lord so there's a continuation that we must continue to follow in the Lord because to be revived is to renew in the mind in the memory to undergo back and look because one of the one of the definitions was to go back to the things that were old to go back to those things that were spoken of as Peter said he said stir up your pure mind in a way of remembrance these things that you've heard you've been stirred up but now you know there's many times that we hear and we see these things but you know all of a sudden it takes something it takes the Holy Ghost to quicken it you know I wish I could almost write a book sometimes of the things that I have read of the prophet of reading of takes a ministry he took a minister behind the pulpit to speak on the exact same thing and all of a sudden it's like did I read that I've had to go back and read it again you know years ago brother Dale preached on the book of Romans chapter 8 and you know and I and I tell everybody ever since that time their brother Dale preached on that I said I can never read Romans 8 the same way anymore why because there was an opening of the world that I never see it the same way why because I couldn't remember what it was like to read it when it was closed they was veiled there was nothing I mean I was reading the same words but all of a sudden now it's open I remember years ago brother Harold Hildebrandt preached it was a I saw a video of him preaching it brother Donnie and he preached on the masterpiece just got finished reading that message I had just read the book and brother didn't Hildebrandt's preaching on that and I stopped then I had to say is that in there and so on we got the book and I'm reading the same thing and you know what some of it I actually highlighted there was things I was reading then you know what all of a sudden brother brain was bringing it out and it was like man it's a brand-new book one because all of a sudden it takes he takes the Holy Ghost but see the problem is is people can't put their faith in a man but you're not gonna put your faith in a man what because yeah it's not me it's not brother Dale snow by the way snow brother Bob's gone brother lease it's not any other brother one because it's a gift of God that's in our lives that we can use but it takes you to operate the gift but the thing is it's the Holy Ghost that does the work I tell you many times I you know I don't know about these other brothers but you know people people ask how do you get a sermon well you know what I I don't have any I don't have any certain way of getting a sermon now some brothers they can say hey I've got them sermon and I'll get to it in three five seven weeks whatever 10 10 months from now whatever I got stuff I'm really I'm really it's all scattered I mean some of y'all some of y'all brothers may notice I study on something I'll put it up and I don't know I won't look at it for months and that's like I get this thought I start working on it and then it only come so far and it's just like it just stops so I just put it on the shelf like well I'll come back to that and then sometimes I come to church and people say boy that was so good I really enjoyed that brother and Psyche oh that's been sitting on the shelf or eight months half-finished but it you know it's just like you catch a thought you put it together some things and then they just and at other times how do you get a sermon you get a sermon the day the day of Wednesday night you can study you can pray and God won't give you enough you don't get nothing and all of a sudden on the just about on the way to church you get everything comes together and you know it does right try you do anything you know what and people people think it's easy it's not and sometimes you know what it takes it takes the leading of the Lord and you got to trust the Lord for him to give you something to say because you know there's so I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just I'm just talking tonight I'm just speaking from my heart let me tell you there's been plenty times I got in the truck card come church on Wednesday night and I tell you what I think boy if somebody else to preach I'd say Amen because you know what I turn it over to somebody else it is everyone because you you come up here and you think man I that's this is gonna flop and you think I don't know what am I gonna do tonight and all of a sudden all I said you get up here next thing you know the Lord starts moving and all of a sudden you think you know what it calls that it's not me and you know what it's the same way with you you get to the place in your life when you get your when you're back against the wall or you run out of your ideas or your plans or or whatever else you think well I don't know what I'm going to do well you know what then that's when God can take over because you get to the point where you're allowing him to move because you get to the place that you realize that's not you you get yourselves out of the way and then God can speak as I tell you I know and I tell people you know people people think it's kind of funny but you get up here sometimes and you don't have anything in there no so all of a sudden the Lord gives you something to say and you start saying it and you surprise yourself what comes out of your mouth and you think boy that was good and you realize you know what it's not it's not you it's God God's the one that does the speaking those Jesus told us he said not to take a thought what you're gonna say you won because he said in that hour he said the Lord will give you your father will give you what you what has to be said what needs to be said and so that's the same way it is when you come to the house of God because you know what it doesn't have to be in my notes it doesn't have to be something I studied on you know the thing is we just get in one in one mind and in one Accord if we come in and we get everything out of the way then you know what we come and sit in heavenly places then you know what God will come and speak to us and the problem is is do we come have we gathered in heavenly places tonight have you come in expecting to receive from God because you know I just come up here and saying Lord I don't want to waste the people's time I want the people to be blessed but you know the thing is is I have to get out of my out of the way Lord do whatever it takes because I want to see the people blessed I want to see the people prosper in the word I want somebody to get on overcoming tonight I want somebody to get deliverance tonight whatever it is that you have need of and you know the first time I ever window it preached outside of them side of my home church I was I told the people when I got up to preach he was a young it was a youth meeting I got up to preach and he said brother Frank Raiders church and I told the people I said I'm as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs I mean I was I was sweating bullets and I got up but you know what there was a sister in the back and she told me after church she said brother she said the Lord come and healed me while you were preaching and so you know that's what it takes it takes the word but it takes God do this do that work it's not us because you know the thing is there's too many people that want everybody to to look at me it's it's me and mine and I know it's none of that it's God and many times people people have got their own on the on the ministry and and it's not that where it's not in the eyes of the ministry it's in the eyes of God that we're supposed to be looking and see that God works through the ministry you know people want to put their pastor on the pedestal well you know what that is that is the a disgrace to God and Jesus Christ and the word to put your pastor on a pedestal because you know what there ain't no there ain't no past ain't no Shepherd in the world trying to trying to Shepherd sheep stand on top of a rock you ain't never seen you never seen a shepherd up on the mountain and all the sheet down there no he live brother and said he lives with the Sheep he sleeps with the Sheep he goes through everything with the Sheep he's there with the Sheep well you know what you can't have them you can't see God you can't see God move in your life when it all you got is you've got your pastor in between you and God and you know what you can't get anywhere if you've got brother Brandon between you and God if you've got oh you can see his brother branham and you know you got a brother branham on this pedestal well you know what we honor we honor brother Brandon we honor the ministry that comes in but you know what you know what it would it would break brother branham's heart I think brother Brandon would be very disappointed if they heartbroken to see the people that have turned and have their eyes on him and not on Jesus Christ he said you're not feeding on the seventh angel messenger he said but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the Son of Man that's who he was trying to point the people to he wants you to feed on Christ he said he said you become the word as you received the word well the thing is is what places we become Christ's brother Brent said she is him that we become the word not son not some tunas not some other idea not something else but we become him we are we are the manifestation of the word in this hour which is Jesus Christ this is from first John chapter 1 the scripture says John first John 1:1 says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that we that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light in him is no darkness at all so see the thing is it's John's writing about what he has seen in the things at here because you know he actually saw Jesus he actually handled Jesus he slept with Jesus he went through all these things but you know what he's speaking of a greater thing that took place one because you know what you're not going to fellowship with Jesus and the friend of flesh as John did you're not going to see him those things but he's wanting you to see that the life that was in Jesus Christ came into him because it was spoken of and he became into him and he said these are the things that we have handled it's not that we handle the flesh but we've seen the Word of God one because we've tasted our the good heavenly gifts because we've received the word we received Jesus not as a flash man but as the word and that's how we're gonna have fellowship with Jesus it's through the word and you know what because they become so real to us and then all of a sudden then you realize you know what then you have brothers and sisters that are Jesus Christ made manifest see we are this is the word that we've handled this is the word that we've received this is the fellowship that we have he said that God is light and him there is no darkness at all program says continuing on brother brems says in pardonable sin he said you know revival means to revive that which is our that our that's already converted see them that's already converts see it's a revival needs to revive to bring back to make life again in the church sometimes we get just a little slack but then he goes on and talking about them said but we're looking for one of those old time like we used to have a long time ago so sometimes you know it's to revive what you already have what you've already heard what you've handled that that's what is to be revived that's a revival that's taking place it's to hold on to the things that you've heard and and then he said you know because we get a little slack well because sometimes it you know because we allow things to happen in our lives where it becomes a little common he thinks that things happen to us where where we don't realize we don't have the fellowship that we had with him before one because we allow the things of like the cares of life get in the way the battle the battles that we face and you know those things get in our way but you know that's the one God wants us to come to these things this is from the impersonation of Christianity 1957 brother I'm says now if we if God meant for us to run his church if but if God meant for us to run his church by denominations or her Creed's the only thing we need is the intelligence of a man the martyrdom and better the church but that's what's not God's program God's program was for the Holy Ghost to run the church the Holy Ghost was given for the church and we can't have two faculties running the church at the same time if man runs it the Holy Ghost goes out if the Holy Ghost runs it usually the man goes out so it's just one or the other so we must come to this conclusion that God intends the Holy Spirit to run the church now I don't mean just the spirit gets up and preaches because the Holy Spirit sets people in the church for certain things and then he continues on he said and he's talking about changing things and you know the things that we do he said it doesn't mean that the church needs a face lifting he said that isn't what the church needs it needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost it needs the power of the Living God a revival doesn't mean to go out and get new members a revival means to revive that what you've already got so that's what we have to have is we have to have a revival of what's been given to us and you know many people in the scripture you know all through the scripture you will see where people actually had the word and listen to the word and held the word and spoke of the word and they failed to realize what was taking place in their hour but same thing is it you hold on to what what he said because it's just like the two going to on the road to Emmaus you know they held the word and it was it was them talking about Jesus to Jesus and they didn't even Rin and they didn't even realize who he was he said who why are y'all so sad and you know they certainly you're are you a stranger and you don't know these things that's taking place and talking about the Ministry of Jesus and everything and tell him all about it how sweet we thought he was going to be the one to take over and all these great things and all the great things that Jesus done and all the things and then Jesus began to expand to him the scripture right what he took them back to the old test and he started to expound the scripture Oh bulls so apart he said here's the here's what the scripture said isn't didn't Jesus fulfilled the one that you speaking of didn't he fulfill these scriptures isn't this what he said he was gonna do that is didn't the scriptures say that he had the comedy would be the one that would die and then he would rise again all the things that he would do now here here they are expounding to him and they're so sad they're like well you I guess so I don't know I don't know what they were doing because here they here they were speaking of the word in the words being spoke to them and you know what they're not catching that the word is being fulfilled and he's even telling them listen this is what was going to take place here it is the third day and Jesus told you he said tear down this temple in three days I'll raise it up again and here it is the third day and you know what if you actually believed actually called what was going on you wouldn't be walking down the road with your head hung down you'd be at the tone looking you'd be looking to see why because and the scripture tells us you know that the women on the first day of the week the women went to the tomb and here they are taking their spices one because they're going to prepare the body here's their here's their mind and the Bible tells us that in their mind there's like who's going to move the to the stone from the tomb one because this the stone was still there well who's gonna move it so we can do this we don't know what Jesus total here I'm not gonna be here that long don't don't make no long plans I know I'm not gonna be here I'm just gonna be here for a short time to fulfill the word and then I'm coming up I'm coming out I'm not gonna be there but here they are wondering who's gonna move the stone and all of a sudden they were astonished when they got there and realized the stone had already been moved why because he was not there and then when the angels came and told him listen he told you that he was raised he said he's not here but he's risen just like he told you he was gonna do he took a took a supernatural happening and then all of a sudden they ran back to tell the rest of them and you know what the rest of them didn't believe evening Peter and John's I know that can't be well he's the one who told you I was going to take place I mean he live with him you you fished with him all those different things and all these things and you can't believe that he can do this one thing you said you saw where he stood before the Pharisees and the Sadducees and tell them to search the scripture and play and take my life and the things that my ministry and the things I've done and prove me where I've not fulfilled the scripture when Peter was walking there in the in the ship and you know they fished all night and they didn't catch anything and here's Jesus standing on the shore and told him he said have you called anything he said no he said would just cast out into the deep and he said you'll receive and he said Lord he said we've fished all night we've not called anything brother branham said the one thing that Peter knew was had a fish he'd spent on his whole entire life on the sea that's all he had ever done his whole entire life was fish he's like you know we know all the tricks of the trade we know what we're doing out here but you know what Jesus tells him to go out and he says he said no nevertheless Lord he said add thy word I'll go out and we'll do what you said and as soon as they went out he said then they had more than they could they could bring in right and here's here's the same one that see all these things has taken this head that's took place when he cut off the high priests ear and the Lord touched him all the things that Peter had seen in his life and even when he before he died he told me he said Satan wants to shift you like wheat and all the things he all the things that he told him in his life to trying to explain to him about his ministry his life everything and then when all of a sudden here's Peter and he's trying to talk to him and trying to explain the weight and believe it either when when there were things that Peter got to say that nobody else got to say when he went up on the mountain to pray when he was praying in the garden he took Peter James and John that wasn't he didn't take everybody and here he is speaking to Peter and Peter didn't believe him Peter's one that denied him even after Jesus telling say listen you'll deny me oh I can't believe that no I wouldn't Lord movie right there we'd yeah and he kept telling listen don't look at these things there's a temporary setback in your mind what's going to take place but you know what it's to fulfill the scripture and all of a sudden here they run back to the team and all of a sudden the tomb is empty and then they come back and then here they are expounding you know he's risen well no look this is exactly what happened like he's saying and Luke Luke chapter 24 tells us and he and they remembered his words Andrew spent all that time trying to tell him what was going to take place then all of a sudden it's like oh yeah he did say that didn't he in the same way with us we we've heard the words we've heard the word but you know what he takes the Holy Ghost too quick and the word to us and all of a sudden it's like oh yeah he did say that didn't he so many times people people pray for they pray for a healing or or financial needs or deliverance or whatever they have need of and they're praying and they're praying and praying all of a sudden the Lord comes on the scene and delivers them and you know what they're shocked that God done it please they prove me he said try me he said knock ask seek and then if all of a sudden you do exactly what he said do then they get shot well the Lord healed me well you know what yeah we should thank God for there but you know what we should claim it and just walk on because we should which they shouldn't take us by surprise that he that it happens if the scripture has he said he said if you if your child asks for stone for a you know for bread or a fish or something he said would you give them to a stone or a snake or something he said he said if your child comes it has a need he said would you not give it to him he said if you being evil know how to give good gifts how much more your whole heavenly Father give unto you well if you have a need then while we so are we so shocked when God meets our needs why because that's the scripture he's doing exactly what he said he would do I guarantee you go back here and ask my boys you know if they want something and want some daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy just like just like it woman with the unjust judge drove him crazy but you know what she got what she wanted well you know how many how many of your children do the same thing if you know if you need something they're almost walk in your footsteps they'll almost get onto your feet they'll stay right there daddy daddy daddy daddy hey daddy you can't hardly turn around sometimes you can't hardly think without them being right there daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy yeah well you know what I've never seen my boys in the whole in the whole time that they I got a 14 year old a nine year old you know I've never seen one over when I give them something they go WOW well how many of your kids when you when you ask for something that you give them something that they act they look shocked what's the same thing with God if you have a need and he said he would supply your needs then we don't have to look shocked big surprise that God meets our needs why because he said he would at times kind of get away from busy that's what God wants us to do God wants us to trust him God wants us to put our our every thought everything on him because he's the one that's going to take care of you if we just come on and just allow him to do what he has because you know the scripture tells us you know I has not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered in the heart of man what God has in store for us you know what if we if we trust God you know God will give us the very best you know why because he done he gave us the very best in the beginning the very best that he could do for us was give us eternal life and if he gave us eternal life then you know what that everything else he's because everything else like he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added unto you because all you have to do is commit it to God and God will come on the scene and meet your every need and give you what you have need of sometimes it may not it may not be what we what we want at the time but you know many times we go back and look in our lives and we think thank God we didn't get what we were asking for why because God knew what we needed and God knew how to stay keep us out of situations that we realized that we didn't need to be in [Music] see God's God so mindful of us it you know sometimes it's just like trying to raise children many times you know they don't see they don't see the long run they don't see the big picture but you have to because you know what everybody's like well you need to be their friends you need to be their buddy well you know want sometimes you can't be their friend in there buddy sometimes you got to be the parent sometimes you got to be the Meany or as in or as in my house I'm the heavy we all laughing felt that's rock that's what well somebody's got to be the one to be the enforcer that's right well you know that's what we have the Holy Ghost he's that he's the one there's the word spoken of a Holy Ghost is given to be the enforcer of the word he's come on the scene to to make all these things take place and you know you know and it takes those because there's many people that have that if in the scripture that we see that those that have held onto the word but you know it takes a quickening of that word because it take it take it because you know they hold onto it many times what we read in the scripture where brother Aaron was talking about Mary and Joseph and you know they're speaking of Isaiah and the different scriptures and like well you know what one of these days this scripture is going to be fulfilled you know you know they were sitting there reading you know because a virgin shall conceive and we see how these things are going to take place while the in a speaking of the Messiah coming and all these things is like well you know we're looking for that to take place but you know one day that was that was an angel that came to spoke to Mary and told her you know what you're the one that's going to fulfill this scripture it's not just happening or something that's going to take place now you're the very one you're the vessel that's going to take it'll make this take place God has come to you and it showed favor to you that you're gonna fulfill this scripture and you know it's the same way with you and I God has given us favor for us to fulfill the scripture why because just like in the scripture and you know one of the things that I was I was looking at was you know many times when we when we look at these things and the in the scripture you know there's times it you know we look and we and lots of times what we kind of put women down and you know they've always want to talk about though we haven't but you know there's if you look in the scripture are certain things that women done that that man didn't do you know just just like Marian and Joseph you know Mary had to Mary had to take the word that Gabriel spoke to her and you know what Joseph didn't believe it here's Mary's taking this word said be it unto me according to thy word well you know what Joseph had problems with that here's the word coming to Mayer I mean to Elizabeth and speaking and you know what she received the word that was coming to her and you know what Zacharias had a problem with it and you know what they God calls their eyes to be a mute but Elizabeth could speak the word well because she received it and then when when Mary come and spoke to Elizabeth then they spoke the word and then she received it and a baby that had moved in all this in six months or whatever all of a sudden he jumped in the womb he becoming here because all of a sudden because at the name of Jesus he moved when she received this salutation of the word of God and there's many other ones in the scripture that you look at that it was women that came you know it was women it was women that went to the grave of Jesus and so that it was that it was open and it went to tell the rest of them and many times we see there's other ones in the scripture where it talks about women are the ones that actually receive the word and went to tell the rest of them and the men had a problem with it you know one of the things they were talking about in the scripture I thought was kind of interesting is you know there's no place in the scripture where a woman give Jesus a hard time it was always men and preachers you know even in the simplest things that Jesus told told the women you know what they could accept the word you know what why because it because it speaks of our day you know I was thinking about what brother Matthew was talking about everywhere in the scripture you see a man then you see a woman you see a man you see a woman well you know that's what takes place there was a man Jesus was speaking well there was a bride there was the women that was speaking of took the word that was speaking of our day and so it's it's our day the word has been spoken our day and you know it doesn't take somebody great or big it just takes a willing vessel God just needs a willing vessel he just needs somebody that's going to take him at his word and then you know because this this isn't this is the revival your if you if you're hearing the word today if it doesn't revive you if it doesn't stir you than you know what there's something wrong with and you know the thing is if and it's not just stirring you that you're hearing the church and inserting you but when it's your daily life there has to be a change in your daily life if it's not stirring you if it's not leading you if it's not making an overcoming a change in your life then you know there's something wrong well because it takes a table because this is the day this is the time of taking place of the metaphor station of the word God wants us to receive the word and he's giving it to us and now all we have to do is take it and go with it and move forward and find out what God wants us to do and just come and make a make and say Lord why what is it that you want me to do Lord just yield ourselves just like just like the Potter and having control of the clay just Lord mold us into what you'd have us to be and this is from the invisible union and there's several quotes and I'm not going I'm not going to get into all of them but from paragraph 54 brother Branham says now but you notice when the people begin to try to line with the word there comes a fresh message from the Word of God right straight to the people and they catch that message and line up every time it's just God's we have that and he says we have family every family in here is accustomed to that sometimes everything will run fine for you for years then all at once you'll hit a spell where we say it many times in the South here when it rains it pours and everything goes wrong you're going through a night then there's a day break then in the night time everything runs in continuity I take a table when I first read that the other night when it says when you're going through I thought it said a nightmare and it says when it rains it pours and everything goes wrong and you're going through a nightmare then I had to review oh it's night time I thought it was a nightmare because sometimes that's what it feels like when it rains it pours you feels like you're going through a nightmare but you know the thing is is you know even when you when you look at this and everything in your life you know what it goes in continuity you know I wanted to read that because you we have ups and downs and sometimes we feel like it feels like the downs are longer than the ups but you know what it's God leading us and still you have those ups and downs but you know God if you're lining up with the words and the words going to come to you and he's gonna give you exactly what you have need of and he's gonna lead you because I want you know because this is this is the hour in which God has come to do this you know many people are blinded by the things that you know they don't see what God's doing and they don't have spiritual eye sight to see what God is doing in this hour but you know what God wants us to see what God what he has for us and you know there's some other things I'm not going to get into not but you know you start to look and see you know even even when you see the word going forth and you know brother man talks about the former and the latter rain you know what he talks about that the former and the latter rain would come you know we see those things here here is a brother Graham said that the Holy Ghost was that was the latter rain that would come and then he said then then the former rain and the latter rain would come to prove that the lighter rain was correct and same thing because you know here is the word it's coming our day but you know we see what took place in the past and what God has done and he's been faithful all the way through and everything that he's done and you know what every age had a revival everything had to have their ups and downs and each one of them had their problems but you know what he was faithful and bringing the revival and bringing the people to their place and you know what it doesn't matter see you go through valleys and you go through hard times and you know what you think you're on the island all by yourself and you think whatever you know but you know what God is faithful he's always led everybody through and it doesn't matter what you're going through you just hold on to God because you'll go through those ups and those downs but you know what he's still going to bring the former rain and the lighter rain that he's going to quicken the word that you hold on to we must get in the word and hold on to the word you know the word is being sown would you where it's up to us to receive that word to hold on to that word and then he will quicken that word bring it to pass he will bring it to fruition hey man god bless you notice let's stay on how the musicians come but God is faithful to us whatever you have needed he's he's brought us into a revival to renew you you say lord I need another one well you know what he's he's here to do it again because you know what if he's done at one time he's gonna do it again why because you know he's gonna continue to revive this bride bring you to the place that you need to be every single time I just thank the Lord for the word because you know what it takes it takes us getting ourselves out of the way and letting him do what what he knew what he wants to do with us you know you have so many people that you know that they wish they knew what to do and you try to point them in the right direction it's Jesus Christ it's Jesus Christ you know as I was reading a sign this little story and had this great musician that came and and they were telling him oh we just love your music you're so wonderful you do you do a great job you know we just we're just so fascinated with all your music and it's like well how did you ever get to this place you must just have a gift from God that you got here and he was like you know it takes practice yeah long hours of practice no it must be you it you must be blessed above everybody else to get to these places he's like no it's practice and they're saying no and they didn't they just kept making old they were just swooning over him he's like it's practice you know I've give up a lot of things for practice and I've spent a lot of time practicing and everybody everybody thinks no it's just some gift of God and you know it just falls on top of you you know no you know what it takes practice right you know and it's just like that in the Word of God you know there you know people think that you have other people you know they're just so blessed that God put them up someplace it's like no they read their Bible and prayed and they read their Bible and prayed and they read their Bible and pray and they study the word and the read the Bible and prayed and they read their Bible and prayed and they read their Bible and frightened you know and people that people just say well it's so amazing that God come and spoke to these people and show them things it's like well you know what there's a lot of people that that you know that for meant a lot of things you know they gave up a lot of things to spend time to pray and to seek God and to listen you know because they put the time into it and then people think well you know I you know I I feel you know like well why God what does it God do this for me well you know what what have you give up what have you sacrificed you know many times because people talk about having a prayer life and and people don't realize prayer is communion and the problem is is they don't have communion you know I work I work with a guy and you know you have to get his attention sometimes to tell him something because you know what he's a motormouth I mean that's that's you know you know what pardon pardon the word but I mean that's what he is he just runs all the time just constantly talking about stuff that you know nobody cares but he's got a talk and then you've got to try to catch his attention hey hey hey Shh then you can talk to him and then he'll be doing something and he'll be doing something wrong and he'll be able to and this oh well I can't find this I can I don't know what the problem is all what the problem is and it's like hey hey hey hold on so let me tell you at the problem is you're not listening to me so I can tell you what the problem is and lots of times the Lord this is the same way Lord's going hey I'm trying to get your attention hold on like that comedian said that time God comes along and he tries to talk to us and he tries to talk to us and he can't and he hits us with a two-by-four and then we start singing he touched me oh he touched me well because he's trying to get our attention but the problem is is we don't have communion it's you know if we went in and say Lord I'm not gonna sit right here and I'm gonna wait for you to say something I don't give you time to say something yeah but you know what we just want to come talk to the Lord and tell him our problems and it's like okay we're done and we don't ever sit and say Lord you speak to me Lord what do you have that you want to tell me you know many times we just go and we sit and say lord I love you and I appreciate you and I thank you for all that you've done for me and all that you've given me but you know I want you to come speak to me and you just sit there something you know I was listening to brother Branham he said you know the best time to pray is like three or four in the morning he said when all the Devils and everything calmed down somewhere else cooled off not run not moving they said then you get up in the morning you can pray people you know I hear a lot of people talk about you know they say you know I'll wake up early in the morning sometimes three four o'clock in the morning 2:30 I'm a week and you know I can't go to sleep and you know it's always where did you talk to the Lord well no you know I tossed and turned like what did you talk to the Lord no I got up took some medicine I went got me something to drink I done this through that it's like what did you talk to the Lord no it's like well maybe the reason that the Lord's waking you up it you're waking up at 2 3 o'clock in the morning maybe that's the time the Lord realized he can talk to you yeah maybe they were trying to talk to you know I was thinking about Samuel you know he thought I was calling the whole time he kept waking up and he kept hearing the voice of God speaking tonight hey you know he kept going to a line he said here am i but you know eli was spiritual and cold on and he told him he said the next time answer Lord here am I here's your servant and you know we could do that too if the Lord wakes you up some you know you wake up in the morning sometimes and you're laying there you know just say Lord well you what would you have me to know you know I've been woken up before in the and them early in the morning sometimes and somebody come on my heart and it's time to pray for somebody and you know because there's something going on in somebody's life that God is wanting you to pray on their behalf so you know God wants to speak to us you know people people say oh I want to hear from God well you know what God wants to talk to you more than you want to hear from him and let's just let's just take a little moment of silence a little sweet hour of prayer you know I think sometimes we could all miss a little sleep to talk to the Lord have him speak to us because you know what you know we all we all need prayer we all need just and you know many times everybody wants to we want when we go to pray we want to pray for our needs it's all about us as I say it's all about me me me me me well you know what sometimes what you need to do if you want to answer from God is you don't need to be saying me me me me me sometimes you need to sit down and start praying for other people I think about brother Darrell Ward that time when he had when he messed his back up and he couldn't sleep and everything like Antony told everybody he said I can't sleep he said I'm at home I can't travel he said I can't preach but he said there's one thing I can do he said I can pray and brother Darrell said he could he was trying to sit in a chair and holding onto their handrails trying to keep his back from moving you know he'd lay in the floor he couldn't get comfortable he couldn't do nothing he was miserable but you told people just started sending his prayer their prayer requests to brother Darrell he said he was praying all the time and he said it cause there's only thing I could do he said I could I couldn't he said I couldn't do nothing but he said I can pray and you know what he didn't get to the point where he's praying for his self he said he was praying for everybody else and he said he was early one morning he said he was sitting in iron he was praying he said the Holy Spirit come in the room right and touched him and that's what we need to think of sometimes we need to be mindful of other people and God can come on the scene and meet our needs Amen god bless you brother [Music] here and bless you drawing near [Music] Gracie let Marshall anybody have a name [Music] Romina [Music] Dramamine they're rusted oh my precious me you know we get to the place we
