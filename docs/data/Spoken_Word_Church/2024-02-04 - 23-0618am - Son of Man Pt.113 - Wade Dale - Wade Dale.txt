give us father it's a time that we honor Father's Day here on Earth but thank you Father that before the dawn of time you were already a father when you said let us make man in our own image and in your likeness we were made thank you Father for that thank you that we were born again that we have a new life and this life that we live now craves the word of God and it craves going to church and it it has a desire to be to have fellowship and friendship and and just uh come around Lord in in a sanctuary or even when you're standing around talking Lord you're there in our midst father I pray that you'd be with the ones that are not here that you'll keep them safe on the highways that You' be the ones that are sick father the ones that are not with us because of that thank you for the ones that's traveled that coming through Lord I pray that you'd give them traveling mercies back home forgive us of our sins father and just be with us now as we talk about you in Jesus name amen all right we've been on the son of man and we're going to continue on heading up to the son of man but we're on the Statue of a perfect man I'm going to bring out a few things today a little bit uh an addition to so let's read John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory in other words it wasn't hidden we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten father of the father full of grace and truth all right 2 Peter 1:5 and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge the knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity you may be seated in the Lord as His blessings to the reading of the word 1 Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy in other words without argument without us having to go into ask 13 or 14,000 different people denominations all right there's 12 or 13,000 brother R said it was 900 back in the 60s well there's 13,000 now if you'll look it up and I know it's true cuz it's on I got it off the internet praise the Lord anyway and without Gody great is the mystery of godliness so there is a mystery and it is great and it's of godliness and as we've been talking where is that godliness now Colossians 1:21 one says and you that were sometimes alienated enemies in your mind by Wicked Works hello we were all There Yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable in other words we have a new father all right we were birthed by our first father and and that we were birthed into death come on but now by the new birth we've been birthed again that's why Jesus said you must be born again birth into Life by our new father or by Our Father the original one all right so now in Colossians it says in the body of his flesh through death to present you he's going to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight all right everybody with me that if you continue in the faith grounded and settled be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard yes all of you in this building have heard the truth amen you have heard what the world is looking for they're looking for a trumpet they're looking for a to bring God on the scene no it's a message and that message has already sounded the trumpet has sounded and you're a recipient of hearing that message and you're also a recipient of sounding that message amen final Voice final trumpet to the final age right if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard in which was preached to Every Creature yeah it's hot in here which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a minister time out now I'm the janitor well Aaron's not here so that was easy who now Rejoice all right now time back in who now rejoice in my sufferings for you this is Paul talking he's a minister he's ministering this gospel to his people well the word is eternal so he's ministering to us right now amen who now rejoice in my suffering for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body sake which is what the church all right he was building the body of the Church of the first church age he was build starting to build this body that God was going to inhabit it all right where of I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God now watch even the mystery now here we go there was a mystery of godliness right listen it's a total mystery to the world how you can live Godly but you can all right even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations so in other words has been hit but now is made manifest to his preachers that's not what that says that says to all of us to his Saints that's me and you to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you so what is the mystery of godliness what is this great controversy that the world has come upon now that they don't even know what gender they are now you got you know you got the Methodist they split on on the gays and all that stuff now you got the southern baptist the good old southern baptist they're splitting from a group because they're letting women come in and preach well praise God for the Baptist that are standing strong but listen we don't have to fight that fight all we have fights to fight in the message don't get me wrong but we don't have those major doctrines to tear our church apart I mean Heavenly days if you if you think of anyway all right to whom God would make known what is the riches of the Glory of this mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect or complete in Christ where to I also labor striving according to his work which worketh in me mightily praise God for a man named Paul amen but praise God for a man named William Brown amen that brought us to Truth All right so now that we can come to Godliness now that we know what godliness is we know as I've been telling you many many times before if you look at the world and and you say well that's an ungodly generation you know what the most ungodly thing is false Doctrine false Doctrine is the most ungodly thing in the world he hates that he hates that Deeds of the nicians he hates those things that we're supposed to be the great Church of Jesus Christ yet we're worshiping the devil now I'm not talking about us I'm talking about the world the denominational world because listen sin is not all the smok and drink and cuss and running around and all that stuff brother R already made that real clear he said the greatest sin was unbelief all right so now that we been brought the truth and we start believing the truth we can come to Godliness all right which is reverence our respect our piety towards God statute of perfect man brother b i I took this quote and condensed it down he was talking about godliness and brother Brown said you say I can't do that brother brandom oh yes you can all right now listen what did the prophet come to do he come to tell us the mind of God he come to tell us what God wants us to know without any filter without any denominational idea he wanted us to know the truth so brother randam is preaching the truth in the Statue of perfect man they say oh brother R we can't do it I'm sure he's Discerning all over the building and they're like well we can't do that we can't do this we can't do that and he said oh yes you can then he proceeds to tell us how and here's a hang up deity that word deity we just we just pull away from I'm not deity well the prophet of God said if you have the new birth you are deity okay so deity is Supernatural now you didn't you wasn't born of deity right all right you weren born a deity but you were born in sin but you became into this family of God by the new birth which makes you deity the divine nature of deities is believe to be immortal goodness and powerfulness any supernatural being listen to what brother Brown said he swore by himself let's save reading let's read the red in it the same life that was in this corn down here at the first stock is ended up here in the ear and the grain just the same it just went on and on and on the same God was in the pillar of fire was in Christ Jesus the same one in Christ Jesus in youl do we believe brother R was a prophet I just want to make sure we in the right I'm in the right congregation that's right God in you the hope of glory is that right the baptism of theol Holy Spirit dwelling in the person now you become what sons of God he's just a portion of God and what is God God is deity all right now brother R in faith the substance 1951 he said deity it fell on the day of Pentecost it still falling all right so if you say well that was for them well now it's for us if you receive the new birth you receive deity you receive not a second person of a trinity you receive the person of Jesus Christ in spirit form called the Holy Ghost all right the brother R's talking about now he's he's moving up to at the spoken word Original Seed I want to hear what I you know I want to hear what what my father said about me all right I I want to hear I don't want to I don't want to have to go to Instagram Facebook or anything and hear what somebody else said about me my father knows me better than anybody that's right all right so this is where brother brandom says the Holy Spirit told him to pick up this pen and write and as sister CLE and I were talking the other day he was so inspired he had to go back and read it again cuz he didn't even know what he read what he wrote that's how inspired that's how much the Holy Ghost took over and wrote this whole summation to me this is the summation of the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time now here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bringing forth of its kind Genesis 1:11 these last days true church Church Bride Comes To The Headstone so it's got to come to The Headstone amen all right we are headstone people yes sir all right we will be the Super Church you say boy we don't look like it now you're just not looking in with the right set of eyes we are a super church because we are going in the Rapture if we're born again all that other group out there is not going in the Rapture right and they're going to have to stand judgment you and I are not a super race as the nearest The Headstone all right now that's us going up the statue of perfect man even look they will be much like so much like him now what is the divine nature of God that's what we're looking at now this whole statue of perfect man is the divine nature of God but it's now not the divine nature of God that we can't get to it's a divine nature of God that we're required to have amen all right remember I read you long long time ago in sermon like 20s something out of 130 were on Earth 113 he said it's required these virtues are required they're required to what they're not required to be a a Christian you can get born again and stay a baby but who would want to who would want to somebody that's been in this message for 30 years and still be a baby I wouldn't I wouldn't want I mean as much as trouble as Josh did give us I he's not here right now I wouldn't want him to stay a baby I want him to grow up and be his own self you know what he's a father now I want him to be that that's the desire is for him to be a father and have his own have his own family and not be living with us praise the Lord so anyway y'all remember that young kids young adults it says leave and cleave they will be one they will be in his very image how we going to be in the image of God if we don't look like him and act like him amen right in the in the order to being united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God now look this is the holy ghost telling the prophet to write to me and you so this is the Holy Ghost talking to me and you today this is your love letter from your father cu the father and the holy Holy Ghost is the same person all right everybody with me then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them now wait through them and by them all right so it's got to come through us the great mystery of godliness that comes to a group of people that were born in sin that didn't have a chance will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word and the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed or Dogma that's why God had to send us a prophet he sent us a prophet not to change the Bible to make sure that we understood the Bible was written one way yes not not 100 and something different ways one way and we got away from that and I'll read it to you in just a few minutes when we start talking about Doctrine because listen everybody's got to have a Doctrine every church had brother R said you're not a church without a Doctrine all right so we got to have a Doctrine The Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that's been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb in other words Jesus fulfilled so so many hundred scriptures while he was here well that's what me and you are to do we're to fulfill how many scriptures we fulfilled my you can't even count how many that the Bride of Jesus Christ is already fulfilled and going to and going to fulfill all right praise the Lord that's what makes us the word that's what makes us the word made flesh all right type of the spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word be unto me as thou Hast said though it was said by an Angel while it yet was written word Isaiah 9:6 in other words Isaiah 9:6 was written back in the Old Testament but an angel came to Mary and said you're going to have this child a virgin and then she said be it unto me according to Thy word all right they will love him love his and will have his potentials now we start talking about this word love and we we're going to talk about brotherly kindness or Brotherly Love in just a few minutes that love is different that love is not lovey Dey lovey Dey amen it's not filo love when you get to Agape Love and I'll read it to you this afternoon brother Ram talks about when you get to agape love everybody says well God is love God is love yeah God's love but God is still a judge he can't go past his word you have to stay in the confines of his word you get outside the word of God guess what you get you get judgment yes and it ain't nice and it ain't pretty because you know what God Said in his Bible I hate oh you're quiet Revelations he said the Deeds of the nians which I hate ah God's a oh wait a minute God's a jealous God wow this lovey-dovey person just love everybody come as you are I drove by a church coming up here and I'm not judging them I'm letting them judge their but the kids was running around it looked like it was school time I mean they had on their shorts had on their hats had on t-shirts I mean you know they were and they were going to church that's not godliness right you and I are godliness all right they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head the headship of Christ was his notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until seeing of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God in Christ see now if you stop right there you say well okay brother Brown said so will the bride what so will the bride have harmony with the father Yes and Christ same person and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it now remember this is the holy spirit writing to me and you nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I got a great big Hallelujah he wrote that himself here's the secret the the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word so when we come to Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience that knowledge is what knowing what to do with the word of God not knowing how to show how smart we are that's right somebody say Amen they don't puff you up that knowledge does not puff you up that knowledge will humble you that God was would come to a simple group of people and open the word of God to us and it' be in our time and in our season see when brother brandham was there there was a time and a season for them in that Pentecostal age but remember in spoken I mean in The Sixth Seal on questions and anwers he said you're not getting this it's not for you in other words it was for us yesen they heard the sound but they didn't understand Bible says is if the trumpet makes a what uncertain sound cuz remember that's the only way they could communicate back in the Old Testament if you had an army way over here and you were part of the West Wing of the army there wasn't any cell phones and it wasn't even time to do smoke signals you blew a trumpet and whatever the sound of that trumpet was Retreat charge whatever more you listen to that sound to that trumpet and if the trumpeteer gave a wrong sound guess what if it said Retreat and the sound was you go forward you be in bad shape well that's what's happened to the word of God the word of God came through the trumpet called the Lord Jesus Christ amen the trumpet that's right and then man has what changed the notes come on man has changed the notes God didn't change the notes man changed the notes so it made an uncertain sound during the church ages but now in the end time right here he's telling us he's bringing it back C yes sir he's bringing it back so that we can understand it he's bringing it back so that we can not be different but be different the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord then it's gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose they do only his will amen I'll believe that no one can persuade them different now we've been talking about godliness and we've been talking about patience and all the different things it's going to take every bit of that though for us to as we were talking about the other day about the the soar of the seed falling into different ground well that's your ground today today you either brought Stony thorny ground you either got a in a fight with your girlfriend wife husband what y'all smiling about and you brought some Stony ground in here you brought some rocks hard rocks in this building but some of you brought good ground some of you brought good ground and that seed's going to fall in that good ground and it's going to sprout up and it's going to give you Revelation and it's going to help you through amen so let's get rid of the Stony places let's get rid of the thorny places all right that and it's you that it's you that brings the dirt in here hello somebody it's you that brings it in here all right they have thus said the Lord that they will keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did completely in his day in other words it's going to be in this day all things when he was here he did not complete all though when he was here for it was not time yet why the bride wasn't on Earth right his natural body was on Earth but his spiritual body was not here his spiritual body only started on the day of Pentecost 11 days after he ascended everybody with me so that's what the Holy Ghost said to me and you that's not a third person second person that's not even me I'm reading exactly what the Holy Ghost told the prophet of God to write to tell you am all right to the doctrine which is according to to Godliness so there is a doctrine that we must be under to take us to Godliness and to brotherly kindness cuz that's the two tough ones cuz they're right up here at the very top all right I got this off the internet so again Jeremiah must be true all right what is a Doctrine in simple terms britanica dictionary definition of Doctrine a set of ideas or beliefs that are taught or they are believed to be true all right so now look we all have a Doctrine did you know that Jesus had a Doctrine what was Jesus's first Doctrine though look at that what was Jesus's first Doctrine brother R said it many many times Jesus's first Doctrine out of his mouth was you must be born again not you need to be or you might can you must be born again so brother Ramy 1961 says now God bless his word and I want to take this subject this morning of Jesus's first Doctrine and the first doctrine of Jesus was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine now in a way of Sunday school so that I won't preach and horse myself up for tonight I've thought in my heart that this is something that seems puzzling watch this puzzling a new birth and how to get it brother Brown said it was the most ill taught subject and I believe it still is the most ill taught subject it's not that you come in and sit down in the message church that's right you got to know Jesus Christ when you know Jesus Christ he'll bring you into the church you won't have to be begged pulled prodded or or hog tied and Drug in here right you'll come of your own free will cuz you know what you come to talk to your father your real father he said um I thought it would be good this morning if we just search this subject clear it out and that's the first beginning you must be born again it's a very deep one and we find out that there are so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say You must be born again that's right all right all churches say You must be born again all right now but not any church outside the message of the hour that I know of teaches that once you get born again that gets you started not finishes you it's not once saved always saved it's once Born Again always born again you can't get unborn again right all right like I said before last Sunday remember you can be saved and not born again but you can't be born again and not get saved you got to come through that but you can stop yourself at saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's not in your birth don't get quiet on me that's not your birth that gets you started in justification right saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost is what this church doctrine believes in we find there's so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say You must be born again but each one has their different interpretations to that what it means to be born again I might go to the Methodist church this morning and they say we believe that you must be born again how do you interpret it I go to the Baptist Church you believe you must be born again how do you interpret it and I would go to each church and we'd find if we went to all 900 different denominational churches there'd be 900 different interpretations absolutely so seeing that there is so many different interpretations and yet a Bible Doctrine there must be and is a truth somewhere same way with us our Doctrine in this church is you must be born again you must be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost to receive the new birth because you can have the Holy Ghost on your flesh and in your spirit realm and die and go to hell you can be just as black inside as the Ace of page amen that's what anointed ones is you better know that you know that you know that when that unclean Spirit goes out he stays out yes sir you seal that thing up so nothing can get in and nothing can get out not just believe the message or believe God sent a prophet or bre brother Dale or bre brother Wayne what we believe what do you believe I tell you what you going to prove what you believe regardless like I said many many times before you whatever's inside of you is going to come out yes sir you can suppress it years and years and years but all of a sudden it's going to pop its ugly head up or it's going to pop its real good head up one of the two so restoration of the brid tree brother ran was talking about the pommer worm can worm and all the different worms that was eating this tree down but I watch what this this little fell started to destroy destroyed what canker worm got the bark Watch what it did began to destroy the bark what did it do it made a natural church for a spiritual church and that's what we have out here we have a natural Church they go to church they do good they give the missions they pay their tithe most of the time they do good work but that's not what all God wants he wants a holy life and something to go with that all right he wants us to be in his very nature it made a natural church for a spiritual church yes sir it took away the truth wake up he took away the true and give it a false who's he God didn't Satan did the fruit the Palmer worm eat the leaf the Locust eat now the bark the covering the religion the doctrine the doctrine the can worm got where did that first Doctrine come from outside of the Bible now Jesus's first Doctrine was you must be born again that's in the Bible all right but outside the Bible who started their own Doctrine was the same guy that stood in the Garden of Eden and put that word not in there God said You shall surely die he said You shall not surely die amen you historians you know where it came from from Rome exactly where it started there they started accepting do why did you put that in there brother Wade our Doctrine has got to be that we go up that statue of perfect man that we come to the love of God and that the Holy Spirit seals us as a unit yes sir not just come in and sit down and and and you know suck on our thumbs and and eat our um eat our um green pea mashed up green peas and no I like meat I got me a pork steak I'm going to eat just here in a few minutes minutes you know why my teeth will allow me to do that even the ones that are false right now so but you know why we're meat eaters and even in the spiritual realm we're meat eaters we're eagles eagles eat meat Eagles does not drink milk eagles eat meat the baby eagle does not start drinking milk it's only one of the four beasts that doesn't all them four Beast three of them start with drinking milk the eagle starts with what Mama chewing up the big pieces and putting them in the beak in the mouth of the baby eagles then you then guess what that baby eagle you don't see a 40 lb baby eagle in a in a nest I promise you that Mom done kicked him out so that's what Mama Eagle's done or daddy Eagle he done kicked us out and we going to have to fly on our own all right so we got to have a Doctrine though and our Doctrine is we must be mature Christians somebody in this world is going to going to be a mature Church a mature Christian that knows what God wants done that goes and reads that and says father that ain't nothing but the truth you you told us you picked your you picked the pen up and by an anointing you wrote something on a piece of paper with a hand of a prophet and he read it to us and now what our responsibility is to live it yes P War caterpillar if it so happens that you your church doesn't believe or you don't believe just the things we speak of in our church doctrine we trust that it will be no means bringing offense because the very first step to successful Christianity and to show that man has received the Holy Spirit is humility real god-given humility that it must be given humbly but yet a church without a Doctrine uh but yet we're not supposed to be jellyfish we're not supposed to just roll over and play dead we're supposed to what what Paul tell us we're supposed to give a reason of the hope that lies within us not that brother brandham said I want you to be able to say I say I don't cut my hair cuz the Bible says not because the prophet told me I don't drink because the prophet said it he didn't come to bring us that he come to sharpen our pencil he didn't change the way to be born again he was exactly the same way Paul and Peter and James and John all preached it in the first church age they preach you must be born again so but a church without a Doctrine is like a jellyfish it has no backbone so our church with the backbone believes that you got to be a mature Christian for God to be able to use you 100% you can bring for you can bring forth 30 if you want to you can bring forth 60 if you want to or you you can bring forth a 100 if you want to all right so we've got to have backbone in it and not also backbone but teeth because the Church of God must eat the bread of life Romans 1:16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believeth how many times you talk to people about the Lord during the week how many times do people wonder by your actions if you know who the Lord is during the week H you can be silent all you want to that's okay think about that though Genesis 1:26 says God said let us make man our own image so he's developing something made in His image and in his likeness now we're made in the image of Samuel and Peggy Dale me Terence and Anna all right right right we have their DNA we have their genetics right so we're made in their in their image and our likeness and we we walk like them we talk like them but that's our natural birth our spiritual birth we're not supposed to walk by natural anymore we're supposed to walk by the spirit which is a different Walk we're supposed to walk like this image tells us to walk that's why this Genesis 1:26 is so important because that's your new birth so what comes to your new birth the image of God the image that God saw of you before the foundation of the world which he loved so much he brought this one together with this one and this one with this one this one listen to get you here and now what the prophet of God said to get your DNA here your genetics here so that he can work on you in his likeness by the new birth so God created man his own image this is the way it was supposed to to be this is where it was supposed to come we were supposed to come this way not by sex but by Spoken Word we were not to come by uh sorrow and heartaches and trials and and and hurts and tribulations and all that stuff we weren't we weren't originally made for that but to fulfill the plan of God he let it happen and that tore us away from God that took us away from this image and put us in a human image but God said hey don't worry I haven't left you I'm going to come back in the image of my father Hallelujah I'm going to come in the image of my father because I got all these kids inside of me that sexually I'm not going to get out cuz that's what's killing you already no I'm going to come as a woman's seed come on I'm going to come as a woman's seed by my father and I'm going to make you a way to get back to this by the new birth male and female created he them and what happened it's a new birth that's what happened that image that God saw before the foundation of world that Eternal image of you came to you and as we were talking it vulcanized with you and you can't tear it apart but now can it can rubber vulcanize with rocks nope rubber has the vulcanize with rubber you have to have a desire in your heart that God change your heart remember we were born with a Stony heart according to Ezekiel and he had to give us a new heart which was not the new birth he gave us a new heart which was pliable so that God can as the master Potter he can throw us on the wheel and make another image but you can't take a rock I've watched him do Pottery all my life I live around Pottery they never have took a rock and put it on that wheel turn it on and here they go now it's still the rock but you take that you take that plowable clay throw it on that wheel and the first thing you do you get a little water and you start like this and you say man there's no way that's going to be a five gallon jar cuz it's only a clump about like this there's no way you're going to act like God but the Potter has a different story right the Potter has in an image in his mind well praise the Lord stick your hand in Lord cuz that's the first thing they do they stick their hand in they go down so far but now Sister Viria they don't go so far to where they don't mess the base up somebody get this they don't mess the base up base stays the same then he comes like this and he brings that and if it comes in and out he just moves it with his hand get some more water now you got to be Washed by the Water of the word he gets some more water amen and he puts that thing and he makes it pliable and man it is amazing what they can make it is amazing what you can get from a clump of clay well listen if man can do that what about God what about a Godly image that we're supposed to be in give him your clay yes sir give him your clay and let him mold you into a Godly image man they'd make those strawberry jars and they'd make it and they make the lip and they'd even make the lip part that would go out to where the water would flow right through that one part all while that thing's spinning and guess who's spinning the wheel they are full control you think you and you know what if you spin that thing too fast it fit starts wobbling now well I have watched some Potters that and they're all K of tant and they um they they start and and start over here and it put too much pressure and it get when it gets to wobbling it falls off that's his Kimo guess what they have to do though they Don't Throw the Clay Away thank God for that song They Don't Throw the Clay Away he just goes back and says hey you you messed that first trial up buddy we're going to try you again we're going to put you on the wheel we didn't give you enough water in other words you you might have got under the pressure too much and and you got a little wobbly well praise God right so that Godly image only comes from God but it comes through you you've got to be the one that lives it you've got to be the one that shows this godliness so is it attainable yes it's attainable the Bible talks about godliness the word Theos which is a deity so here we go back to the deity part whatever can in any respect be likened unto God or resemble him in any way God's representative or vice Regent magistrates and judges second Timothy 3:1 says persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and Iconium and lrom what persecutions I endured so guess what you got to endure some persecution yes sir but I didn't finish my story you know what happens when they get finished with the pot they're not finished with it you can't put anything in it at the moment come on somebody try fill it up with water and it it be just sitting on the wheel it's going to go why because it hadn't been putting fire yet praise God it hadn't been putting fire yet and we used to unload them things you'd have to put on big old gloves your tennis shoes would stick to the floor that's how hot that thing got but you know what you put those pots in and you just really I mean boy Joe Craven would Bust Your Hide if you broke one of them things cuz that was $1.50 out of his pocket probably out of your yours too but we'd set them things in there one at a time and you'd stack them up one upside down one the other in this kill and you walked in the ovens on both sides right here you fill that thing up and then you walk your way out to the end then you seal it up seal it up then you turn the heat on well when uh heat got when he got finished you didn't have to go in there be so gentle you had to be a little bit but not so gentle you could grab two at a four at a time cuz why then they had hardened into a good Christian they got where that they that pability had become what the Potter wanted it to be not just something that's Wishy washing all the way back and forth and back and forth no something that can be used Joe Craven made Millions selling them things as Bob said Wednesday 10,000 worlds that's what your Soul's worth not just one one would be good enough 10,000 Worlds the prophet of God tells us persecutions afflictions ovens trials tribulations but out of them all the Lord delivered me yes yeah and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived we know that's the end time all right so we can live godliness we can be Godly as I said before you you think I'm nothing you sisters you're the greatest testimony I mean when I walk into Walmart with my tennis shoes and my blue jeans and and they don't have holes in them where's Dan they don't have holes in them we used to send them well mommy used to throw them away if we were caught to brother Kylie brother Kye said right we caught with holes in our britches uhuh we got holes in our britches all right pay out now they buy them for a100 $1 a piece with holes in them I should have kept all mine and sold them this world is not my home look at the craziness though how they're dressing but see we've we've come out of that we don't have to go to salon and get our hair done and our nails done well some of y'all do nails done we don't have to go and you know open up the cabinet and then you got like $5,000 worth of Max Factor all different shades and sizes and ain't that Max Factor Max Factor yeah open up thank you open up what did I say oh sorry anyway I have my coach with me today but you don't have that praise God praise God I always I always said I said you look at the world and there's some beautiful girls in the world but they're all made up I'd hate to see Dolly parted at 7:00 in the morning it'd be like that song we played the other day about side by side there was more of the woman on the chair than it was in the bed cuz she took her eye out she took her hair dat out she took her leg off took her wig off and her teeth out yeah well that's what the world looks like to us though they look want to be so beautified and so put together together to to me it's ugly and you know who you know it's wor maybe y'all wake up some of y'all are still asleep but that's what the world looks at and says well that's beautiful I don't it's ugly cuz it's like Daddy always said you can paint a barn you can paint an old barn with fresh red paint but the old barn is still underneath that now that's F your pastor now he said that for years but praise God listen we've been come we've lifted out of that we don't have to do that we don't have to go by the fashion of the world come on I'm getting myself a hand clap if you love the world and the things of this world the love of God is not in you I didn't say that the father said that yes he did we have to be in the world we have to rub shoulders with the world but remember I read you that scripture the other day in St John 17 Jesus did not say I'm going to take you out of this world and put you in a bubble he said father they're in this world so I'm going to pray for them not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the world that's what our protection is is from the word of God I mean you ever thought about that I mean thank God that that our sisters don't have to buy $500 of worth of Mary Kay and Lord you I work for the Post Office and it that thing comes in a on a monthly plan I think you know this Mary Kay comes in and she's got like 50 packages and I'm like man how much is them packages they could be $50 $25 $150 brother John praise God sister Alicia is not on that list amen see because that's not on your that's not on your plan your financial plan does not include Mary if you buy Mary Kay that's your business but my wife don't need it she's beautiful from the inside out and that's all I worry about I was looking at her the other day she's so pretty you know brother rown told us he said we'd all get old he said you'd remember when you shoulders was all squared you know and uh you watch life was all beautiful and fresh he said but when you get older you still need to see that the beauty that comes from within first amen praise God that's why we were talking the other day about love there's a lot of people in this world do not know they say I love this well I do I usually I say I love to hunt Jeremiah I love to hunt well now love is compared to what okay compared to the love of God if I hunt on if I hunt while church is going on I feel a little different so let's continue on but praise God that we don't we don't act like the world we don't even think like the world right Regina thank you Jesus I mean if I had to act that way to make it I'm sorry just wouldn't make it let's talk about brotherly kindness well well see then we're on the path to Godliness all of us you Sisters You Brothers even the brothers you know you don't have to worry about you don't have to worry about your liquor bill or your tax bill or going to eat at a restaurant man it cost still sorry brother John it cost 20 or $30 a piece almost now to eat a meal and find it in your budget you're in trouble but what about them people that sit and drink three four five drinks before the meal thank God that's not on my plan you know why cuz number one it's stupid number two it's not my desire I don't care if they go up to $50 a drink what does it matter to me I don't care if they go up to $50 for a case of bear who cares you see what you taking yourself you say well that's kind of little little is much when God is in it labor not for wealth or fame there's a crown and you you can win it if you'll go in Jesus namej brotherly kindness let's talk about this just for a second then we'll then we'll close for the afternoon everybody all right amen y'all get you nap in between services or y'all going to be in trouble this afternoon second Peter 1: 15 besides this in other words besides the new birth besides being born again besides beginning to act like God giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge the knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and and godliness we've come now to brotherly kindness and I'm going to tell you something this is going to get tough yes sir all these other things are inward okay all the faith is mine uh virtue is mine but you give it out but it's mine knowledge Temperance patience godliness it's what's inside but now brotherly kindness is something you got to give to somebody else brother kindness is something you got to give to somebody else cuz you got to love your neighbor the same as you do yourself well get quiet cuz it's going to be I'm just here in just a few minutes you know Jesus said one time he said while you're praying while you stand praying forgive he said because if you don't you won't be forgiven of what you pray for Wow H H Philadelphia brotherly kindness that's the word for Brotherly Love brotherly kindness It's Love of brothers or sisters Brotherly Love in the New Testament it's a love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren and we know that's not the same love for a wife that's filo love agape love is brotherly love everybody with me it's supposed to be anyway sometimes we get it all convoluted and it all comes down to something else all right so Philadelphia love his Brethren loving brothers and sisters look in a broader sense loving one like a brother loving one as brother Donnie always said my family this is your family and and praise God if your family is physically sitting here but if your family is not physically sitting here this is your family I'm talking about blood all right this is your family this is the one you going to spend eternity with not that one all right now look God is love but love typically produces obedience now watch I thought I'd throw this in here this is kind of a few quotes from from a few places but God is love now God is love agape love right God is Not F your love God can't fil your love God can't lust God can't have fil your love God is agape love and that's it God is love but love typically produces obedience now look look and for all who refuse to repent and believe in Christ they receive Justice which is true for those who do trust in Christ they receive what they don't deserve called Grace and have withheld what they really did deserve Mercy which side are you on do you have eternal life or do you still have the wrath of God abiding on you you know if you're born again today the wrath of God will never touch you that's right if you're not bornn again today you are under the wrath of God all right I'm just telling you what the Bible says Matthew 24:12 says and because iniquity shall abound what is Iniquity knowing to do better and you don't or knowing to do something then you don't do it and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold have you not seen that in this end time it's all selfies and we'll get to that in just a second maybe real quick first Peter 1:22 says seeing you have purified your souls souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned are love that you can't contain unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed or Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever that word fervently sincere undistinguished brother rown said and you must be born again say anything had a beginning had an end so see every love had a beginning except agape love everybody with me cuz it listen if God Loved You at the beginning he can't UNL love you anywhere else amen cuz he can't change his mind that's right all right so we've got to get up into agape love he led us and allowed us through Adam and Eve and what they did he allowed filo love and for us to have love for our wife love for our but still still even filio love has it has like levels you can't love I can't I don't love Deanna back there she's my granddaughter I'm sorry I'd shoot every one of you for her but I love my wife different than I love my granddaughter but it's still fil your love then we know what it goes down to it goes down to all them other things do you ever think of that God the Great Master rainbow in the sky with seven spirits of God red perfect love after that comes fio love from agape love to fio love that's the love that you have for your wife if some man would insult her you'd shoot his brains out see I wasn't very harsh brother Brown would shoot brains out see because it creates a jealousy but that FAL that's FAL love secondary love then comes lust for another man's wife then comes filth and we see that in the end time see it just becomes perverted but all of this kind of love had a beginning but when that real genuine love of God that I've been talking about comes into the human being by the new birth being born again it had no beginning and it will have no end yes you are then a Son of God a daughter of God and your affections are on things above fio love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife agape love would make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference like brother Dale somebody asked one time a long time ago said would you shoot somebody if he was intruding in your house would you shoot somebody he said yes I would he said but I'd pray for him till the param Maric got there right shoot first pray later so don't come and I've never done that never went in his house without announcing who I who I was what's going on too baptism of the Holy Ghost 1958 let me read this and then we'll close musicians get ready to come and then the first great spirit of God which is love God's like a great rainbow we couldn't imagine what he looks like look at the perversion in the world what they've turned the rainbow into those are seven colors of God those are the seven uh spirits of God those are the seven things that God give us as a covenant and the world is making it some garbage LGBT and all that other stuff they're doing they've used a rainbow well I think we ought to take it back then again the first great spirit of God is love God's like the rainbow we couldn't imagine what he looks like but just say you look like the rainbow in spirit the perfect Spirit of love red blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship just all perfect spirits and then you begin to condescend coming down and they come all the way down from fio love or agape love to fio love and on down to lust and on down to the lowest and then God himself became a man Jesus and came down that same way to the lowest pits of Hell picked out those who he knew before the foundation of the world the Genesis 126 crowd the Born Again crowd all right whose names were written on the book and redeemed them back to itself there you are the story of redemption cannot be fully known until we see him and stand in his likeness listen the full Plan of Redemption will not be understood until we get that Capstone when we get to The Headstone that's when it will happen I'm going to go through this just a second will I don't need that let me read this down here real quick and then we musicians come on everybody let's stand that's how much I had to miss don't look up it'll make you sick we're going to talk about that this afternoon we're going to get to this I said we get to it today but we're going to get to selfish cuz you can't have brotherly love and be selfish selfish means to be selfish is to be concerned excessively and exclusively with yourself selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God and inspiring relationships with other people that many of us desire let me read you what the prophet of God said about this 19 this is 1950 not 2023 brother Brown said the people has got too selfish got to a place where they think they live in a low World by their s you know that's the truth all right listen to this this is where I wanted to get to but I'll read it this afternoon but now this is your Prophet 1954 he says I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming upon me a prophet he got a selfish Spirit I'm just reading what he said don't don't don't criticize me I'm I'm reading exactly what he said I selfish Spirit coming on me saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong we'll talk about the rest of it this afternoon we'll get to that part amen you love the Lord am let's don't be self we got selfie sticks we
