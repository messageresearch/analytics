doing something I guess it's on working some of that brother came back through so I don't know what all is going on but anyhow just pray for him and said he'd be away for tonight the weekend so remember that okay let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as brother Gibby comes to bring the word of the Lord unto us and just think about it Open the Eyes of My Heart oh Open Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you to see you high and lifted up yes Lord shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing Holy Holy Holy High lifted shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy Hool holy holy I want to see you amen you know it's been said a lot of times you don't see him just look around because that's the only way you going to see him unless it's by Vision or he showed you your in a dream until we meet him in the air and it's good to be here today and uh I've uh I've struggled a lot because I've got a message I'm G to try to I want you to understand I want you to listen to what I'm saying I want you and don't try to get ahead of me and don't try to just listen to what I'm saying amen and God God will bless you with it I believe and uh if you'd uh you'd like to uh let's see if I won't lose my glasses again this time uh I'd like to uh uh read uh 1 Corinthians 14 these some of the same scriptures that I used the last time that I I spoke and uh I want you to you have to read between the lines you have to see between the lines right God spoke to me one time I was sitting in my living room and I was I was studying and I didn't I've told this many times uh I don't know how long I had been in what I was in I don't know if it was a vision I don't know I just know that it was as real as I'm looking at Brother Sam now and all at once he started speaking to me he said I know I listen I had Christ M God reveal land right there at at my foot right there just on my fireplace I so I know what the prophet of God said in the next to the last page of Christ Mr God reveal and I'm going to say but he was speaking to him and he's the only one that se what he saw right and but he has to speak to you glory this is what we're return back to the Eden condition again where he can speak with us and we speak back you know he did say in why Christ speak no church no matter how fundamental it is that church can't Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among us something that we can speak to that'll speak back and vindicate himself now if we if we're not don't find ourself doing these things God help us because God is doing things among us amen and and most time we don't even see it he said the angels of God encamps about those who fear and love the Lord that means that this room is full in all outside everywhere the angels of God is here why because God is in your soul he's on the throne of your life and the angels of God are in Camp about right him and you just happen to be added into it right but uh let me uh let me go ahead and start here let's pray before we start father Lord you know that I can't do anything father without you and Lord neither would I want to do anything without you but father help me to just yield and humble myself before you and surrender to you Lord that you can take these unworthy lips of clay and bring your word to the people and touch the people in a way tonight Lord that that will bring such sincere desperation to see you and to know you as brother Bob preached here the other week have you really we really heard the voice of God CU we know 2000 so years ago you was among the people God himself and they didn't recognize you and the few that did recognize you Lord they they seen it by Revelation and that's what we have to see and hear the voice by Revelation and God you want to speak to us so sincerely and and get us into the position and I believe you can and I believe you will bring us to Rapture and Faith father and bless us tonight Lord God as we Endeavor to to go on with this father and try to show the people something Lord God that you've shown us father in Jesus name amen now Paul Paul's speaking here and and You' think it was uh he was speaking about speaking in tongues you know interpretation but see you got to go a little deeper than that you got you got about to get spiritual like I I started to say a while ago he spoke to me and says being spiritual talking to me you you being spiritual you watch spiritual things right and I realized he was talking to me says if you turn and look at the clock it's a big clock wall clock behind me if you'll turn and look at the clock and it was you know every 15 minutes it it Chimes Chimes Chimes Chim he says it's a he said if you'll turn and look at the clock and it was doing that he said it's exactly 2:00 cuz he went he said the end of the second pull third pull is the hand and I ain't had nothing but troubl ever sense I don't know I I I I believe I know what it was but I tell you right now when Joshua took the people over Jordan and gave them the land they fought for every inch of ground they took now when we read this and and I I've got quite a bit to read tonight but when I read this I I want you to be spiritual now being spiritual and if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can be spiritual and you ought to be spiritual exactly and watch spiritual things and you and you'll recognize that many times he walks right by and we don't recognize it is it is it our fault probably so cuz if one can cause the church to fail one can cause somebody to lose their healing that means it ought to be some sincere right amen praying and and and casting everything the cares of the world away from us cuz it's going to take this to make the Rapture amen and let's get started now Brethren I I if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by Doctrine so tongues tongues tongues is it's a gift of God and praise God I've done it I pre appre appreciate God for it I didn't ask for it he just come he just did it you know and that don't make me anything I mean I but but I appreciate him doing that right because he spoke to me in the first person after that and it was seven other people in the room he spoke to them too and now there's two what three three or four that follows what he told us to do so so anyway you can be see I want to continue on with that he says in 1 Corinthians 148 11 for if the trumpet the gospel trumpet if the and and God's got somebody designated to speak he said uh for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle right now I'm not talking about going out here fighting Goliath so we got enough Goliath right here in your mind in your brain but see you've got to know the word you've got to you got to know the Mysteries because he said in Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the Mysteries a l l all the Mysteries would be revealed as he had declared to his servants the prophets and we are we Church you and I this is what God has called us to do let me tell you little something that I sitting there brother there was preaching the other day the other week two or three weeks ago how it was and I and I was thinking about the prophet of God said though is revealed to you there's still a supernatural element not made known to you correct now see see if you can swallow this one Paul went into the into the desert for three and a half years or so studied the Old Testament strolls come out and preach and wrote 14 books under the inspiration of Holy Ghost right and do you know he's a pattern messenger amen he he brother brand used them as a pattern message All Through the Ages you know through the church ages but do you know there was a supernatural your ailment not made to Paul there was reserved for you and me and that's what you and I are called to exactly we're called to bring the Rapture into effect amen we're to be so one with God and the Mysteries so Made Alive to us that I mean the Revelation that it takes preeminence over anything in our lives right to bring us so close to God that one day that he'll speak through us and the dead in Christ rise first and come to us do you believe this I'm saying do you really believe this or are you believing unto it that's now you got to decide that right you got you you got to just like brother Bob was speaking what a message brother what a message for me that that I I enjoyed it say well it's simple it wasn't simple to me right because to hear the voice of God you got to hear him through the word I've been listen you can tell people about God's been speaking to me I mean I all night I was up all night night before last I'm speaking to God God speaking back you believe that amen no you don't have to but see that you know how you'll get to where you can believe that God doing the same thing to you right and if he does it to one he'll do it to the others that's why when somebody comes here with a testimony you ought to listen to it and don't just hear and clap your hands and praise God and walk out and forget it cuz God does something he something to put it up before the people that the people can see it and draw from it I got to go on let me continue here for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound so if the preacher we've heard a lot of preachers in our lifetime most of us here and and when something don't sound right it'll go bone yeah see so there was there an uncertain sound there there was a gospel trumpet you know that he said a trumpet would sound a seal would open a mystery would come forth there'd be one to pick it up and preach it y there would be a group of people that would receive it and be sealed away and it would be a group of people that said they did too yeah right and they were sealed away in another place so likewise except you hutter by the tongues words easy to be understood right now the preacher could get right here and uh brother Dale said something the last two or three times he's he's preaching on the Old Testament saints that I got a lot of notes here I'm gonna get on to get on if God give me Grace but he said something and I wonder if he caught it he said whatever they done whatever they done he said they achieved D what God called him to now what was that achieving why did they achieve it you have got to achieve what God called you for and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Brother Richard you've got to find that you are God's elected that's right exactly and you find it out because God is on the throne of your heart called for knowledge then he will show you right in that vessel where you live right where you stay he will begin to talk to you and take you back into the back part of his mind back before the beginning and said he said in adoption series that God put your name on his lamb book of life before the foundation world because he knew the deceitfulness of Satan and what he was going to do when you got here so he had you there and when you come in contact with that you going to know you ain't going to die amen and it it's going to take desperation he said we I don't see a lot of it myself you know and I'm not near desperate enough but he said be desperate to perish right okay so you got to have a Ministry and we got one and I'm not saying I'm not going to say anything contrary I'm just going to let br br speak for himself right so if we believe the prophet and everything the prophet preached we'll see tonight we'll see if you believe him I mean that that's Ser that's that's a hard statement but it's I've got some things right here that's part of the mystery if we don't see the first resurrection how are we going to see the second Resurrection which is us I ain't got to that yet there are there are the 10th verse of the first chapter 14 uh 8- 11 there are there are may be so many kinds of voices is in the world none of them is without signification I if I say a word right therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice I don't know what the preacher is saying I won't get desperate enough before God and ask God to explain that to me Lord right I want to run I want to do a confessional I want to do like the Roman Catholic Church does and go into a booth with somebody and have them tell me what I want to hear yeah yep that ain't it I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian in other words I'll have a revelation you want or you'll have a revelation I want right and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian to me right amen now this is this is I want to get into this right here just a second 1 Corinthians 14:20 Brethren and I call you Brethren I call you bride amen be not children in understanding amen be not children when I was a child I acted as a child right I spoke as a child I played as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things right and Paul is still speaking here okay he says Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice you know what malice means be ye children if you want to be a child going to be a child he said but in understanding be men right in other words we have grown into a place right amen exactly we keep looking off the Rapture is going to be it's going to be and it's Among Us right now there's people capped off right now waiting on you and I the mysteries of God we've got to know the Mysteries Donnie let me just let let me say something here okay I'm going to read this is in seed is not there with a shook I just want to get this out of the way it's page 11 U Brother Joseph he says here then what is it now and youve we've read it read it many times we must be about the father's business right are we about the father's business amen we we try to help one another we see somebody going wrong and we and we we'll do anything if we're right if we have a revelation we'll try to help people that's always been in my makeup I just wanted to help the people and I have been ridiculed I have been called everything that you could get to about call somebody and I've stuck right there to it and and I don't see how I did it for a long time but I know how I say I did it through him I can do all things Paul said through Christ Jesus that live to me we must be about the father's business now examine yourself like he told me you know he said being spiritual you watch that means I've got to I'm seeing things because he's speaking to me but he he said you going to have to watch things when he spoke to me through uh tongues one one day I I was dying and and when he come back in the first person he spoke he says fear not I'll never leave you nor forsake you and then it was a slight pause he said be not afraid and brother Bron said when he says you don't be afraid watch out it's some coming and it did we must be about the father's business the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must I do it do vindicate Malachi 4 right now this here right here Paul wrote 14 books in in the New Testament plus the rest of them okay this he was a patter message even Peter said he says Paul says things hard to be understood but they were something with help from them that was to come on a end time people that sitting here right I hope everybody that's right that we're to that we're to do Malachi 4 he preached in in uh uh 62 he said word p has struck the world but as of yet Malachi 4 ain't been fulfilled and it took the one year later the Thunders open and even there when it open that that was the son of man Ministry that me and you have that takes us to the change of the body and and that's the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 right that's the completeness of Malachi 4 do you see in yourself and this is part of my Ministry I look to you I said do you see it right I have a lot of people get mad I've had people walk off and never come back because I do that I can't help it the way I am you know but um vindicate Malachi 4 that means you got to vindicate Luke 17:30 right son of man Ministry exactly seven Thunders you got to vindicate it with your life amen your very life he got to show God Malachi 4 is a full work word and also constitutes and brings into play the church age book in 336 his these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turns you back to the faith of the Father the same Ministry that John 14:12 he said the things that I do shall you do also there is people that this is happening to right already brother brother Marken brother said if somebody comes to the pull pit and pray for for and don't receive their healing it ought throw the whole church into desperation exactly do we see that or do we walk out and and uh we might say well praise help them Lord but do is there desperation I don't mean just in their physical body it could be in their mind I don't know how I'm doing all this but I don't mean I got to get off of this vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138 right exactly take 138 let me I I want to say this with Abraham and Sarah back in the 17th chapter 18th chapter of the Book of Genesis now why did Abraham fall down in life why did Sarah doubt how can this be how can this be why H what made them do that what made Abram give his wife away and Savor went with it because he said to what made that what made him come back is Abraham with a change body and do the same thing right right you got to watch your types now right I'll tell you what the truth was I'll tell you exactly what it was they did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Inside their soul if they had the Holy Ghost Inside their soul Abraham would have never gave his wife away and Sarah would have never went there right exactly amen exactly right am right never neither would would David have took bash Sheba and prator and sent her husband to be killed if he' had the Holy Ghost Inside his soul so we have the Holy Ghost he said with John the Baptist he said now there ain't never been one born of man greater than John but the least in the kingdom is greater than John then you don't have to do these things he died on the cross in flesh that you don't have to do it in the flesh right we are so concerned we think good works is going to do it good good works ain't going to get you one thing right right it ain't going to get you one thing right that's right and it it's good to do good works now we we we got a St John 14:12 vindicate all his word amen Revelation the 10th chapter of the opening of Seven Seals and the MS of God even to the serpent seed I remember when brother Dale preached on the serpent seed on first seal and brought that out perfectly it ain't went nowhere right he still around in the air am if if somebody wanted that would say we sing that song when he passes by well just reach up and get it right you can do it we I I look for The Impossible that's right amen I believe God can do anything just like he said right there when he said in in uh when Sarah did what she did how can this be I don't know about you but I took my life my life God took me and on that scripture where he said is anything too hard for the Lord I put myself right there Hebrews 138 he has never been too hard for him he wasn't too hard for him then and he and he knew a people was going to be here at the end time with the most deceiving the most evil thing has ever be and we was going to need to see that right there and hold to that right there and it followed me all the way to this this moment God help us all we can't do this brother said ain't it ain't me doing it it's him doing it in me we can't attain to to this right here but God can attain for us amen amen listen if he gave me a promise when he gave me that Revelation oh on Genesis 184 when he when I seen that right there he said is anything too hard for the Lord I seen Hebrews 13 raiseed up in me and I believe that God can do anything all I got to do is just yield to God and soak that word up and get closer I tell people all the time you ain't got no choice you better get closer to God right you better lay these things down cast down imagination all these things better go they better go you want to go in the rapt that's right you want to go in a Rapture don't get tied up with the world that's Satan that's Satan doing that he's trying to wrap you up in some little wave of his and hold you there right and the only way to break out is by hearing the correct word of God and obeying it and God will come to it right amen okay John 14:12 the things that I do you'll do also I've did it in my own humble Ministry my own life I've seen so many things I've seen God I've seen God raised the dead twice three times no I I've se you do it three times I'm not ashamed of what God has shown me exactly and I'm not holding back right I want to share it with you he said if you get in the same predicament or or or that with God or whatever it is he'll do the same for you have you really have you really heard the voice of God speaking to you or is it just something that that you've readen you and you're you're imagining and and and thinking it's Revelation cuz Revelation changes things I want to I want to read you right why I I don't I don't think I put this is up Joseph but if you can get it I sure appreciate it 1 Timothy 6:16 I want to I want to explain that just a little bit because I got a lot to do and and don't look like I'm going too fast so y'all might be here a while now if you read before and after in your in your Bible yeah it says here in the 16th verse let's read the 15 which in his times Jesus he shall show who is the blessed and only potent at the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and the next verse now the next verse I won I want you to read this right here because this is as far as a lot of people goes yes now I want before I read I want to say something here's a statute perfect man here's somebody that had received the baptism of the Holy Ghost we said we talk about today today when he when he filled you right here with his Spirit he began to take now your soul is Immortal your soul is eternal and he began the work right there to build this statue the perfect man which is you which is you he began to to take corruption out of you right now I'm not saying that this body is Immortal now but he heading toward it real fast right amen he began to he said he would take corruption and put and put incor corruption in you and he would take mortality and put immortality in you and he's doing that church can't you said it he's doing it right here as your walk he you don't do what you used to do it's because the immortal life of Jesus Christ is inside of you and when he gives you a revelation it's divine part of himself which is eternal life and that why do you think you'll be changing in a moment TN of I just because you've been playing Church you got to you'll come so close you'll become so one with God till you and the voice is the same brother Bob when you speak it'll be him speaking through you not him just say step out the way Bob I'm going to speak to you now no you're so one with him what you say is what he would say Amen what you do is what he would do don't you want this do you not believe that you can attain to this you can't on your own but God in Almighty promised it right that's that he would bring us to this place he was bring us back to the Garden condition again right okay let me let me read this I want you to see the the supernatural ailment we have to come back to the pattern messenger that's what brother Brown that's the first thing he was to do he was to bring us back back to the first part of Mal Malachi 4 where the word pure and unadulterated has come into me you and prepared a place that he could come forth with those Thunders and literally kept you now who only ha immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and power and everlasting amen right now take this right you couldn't you can't do it you couldn't approach him even M of when he when he did what he did in the garden it was God to come Adam Adam where are they Adam amen they was in the upper room 120 of them and the Word was not alive they couldn't make it alive right nothing they could do but almighty God that was unapproachable approached them amen and drop down on them and fill them with the Holy Spirit and show them the the road map and that's what this here is doing through the ministry right we're so mixed up it don't take but one little mix up right it it it'll get you off the road or run you out of gas or something right I want the full word of God I want all of Jesus Christ to take this vessel that is standing before you and I know you do but we got to do something they couldn't approach see the approach the Holy One the The Immortal one then when we did he pulled us into his light which is his Revelation and begin to reveal himself to us and take this corruption out of us yeah and and he it's a constant working constant working and remember you fight for every in that you get and God lets you be tested he lets you be tested to prove to you he knows what you going to do but to prove to you what you going to do and a't going to do exactly amen that's right yeah thank you Lord I'm on and God and on page 15 or paragraph 153 of that seed not every with Chuck God V vindicates it to be true right that somebody is vindicating amen Malachi the full statue of of of of Malachi 4 which is the full word and the H ship on it right which is a revelation of complete Redemption he said your glorified body is being built right around your new birth right brother de used to say it a long time ago he said everything I get has to come has to come by that new birth right that's how I know where I'm riding exactly that's right sure he said it is fulfill in this age so somebody is is fulfilling amen is it you if I would ask for and I want but if I ask for a raise of hands are you ready for the change yeah I'm talking about ready now I ain't talking about hoping for wishing I'm talking about you know you know that them Thunders listen Thunders caps the pattern messenger message right let me let me tell you something it'll help you why is it because I'm going to read these quotes we may say here a while but I'm going to read it because you need to hear them why is it that brother Bram when he was caught up beyond the curtain of time and said I want to see Jesus why couldn't he see him that's right why you want me tell you why because he was in his Theo not his glorified body he said in Matthew 26 over here when we was doing a communion he told them he he says I won't drink of the fruit of the vine until I drink it a new with you in my father's Kingdom and that means that Rapture marriage supper in a glorified body and that's why he couldn't go into the presence see he listen it's going to take that glorified body Spirit come back to the soul the theophany and come and pick up his spot in a glorified state to bring us into his presence right Glory that's correct now I got some on Old testony Lord don't get throw off you got to have your own Revelation I I the ministry will preach it and we need each other so bad God we we're we're we're we have to be tighter than that right you doing your place me doing mine and you doing yours listen if if uh well I'm going I want you to understand this right here there's no way anybody could ever approach God and if he had not have come down here right and did what he did yes sir where we would be right and let me tell you let me let me make another little gesture if you don't mind the Lord Jesus was hanging with his hands out like this nailed there one toward the old one toward the new yeah he finished this one he finished it I'm I'm I'm going read it he finished it and was fixing the bill this one where men you at but this had to be had to be finished now they'll they'll fall in line one day it say it didn't say it didn't say the script the quote didn't say that they' be resurrect how many Resurrection would they have to do right when you resurrect how many times when we to show you that we need to see these things when the spirit comes back Beyond Cur time when the spirit comes back and gets your theophany which is holy which is righteous which is waiting and your spirit and your body comes and pick up this body in a glorified State and we can go into the presence of God and that's the only way we can do that what about these wherever they listen where I'm I'm going to show you where they at now if you want to believe they in they got the Holy Ghost believe it if you don't when they was in I'll tell you this when they was when they was in Paradise they didn't have the Holy Ghost but let me throw a little something in there for you to think about you know Adam and Eve was in there too right they had eternal life exactly don't test them saints didn't not there they didn't but now what about that one yeah I thought about that and I said whoa when he first come to me I said I said well now he didn't have him somewhere else did did it no he didn't have them that's where they's at right praise God that's what I believe and uh I'm going to just start here if you don't mind I'm I'm going to start on a I want to read this right here uh number page two Brother Joseph and I want to see that we have got to complete this these is these is the Mysteries right here I mean right here and I ask a long years ago we down in the fellowship hall down there and I asked a bunch of the brothers down there I said let me ask you a question CU God showed me something I said let me ask you a question I said can you take the church age book and preach the seals not a word I can yeah by the Finger of God yeah can you that's just coming right that's just coming I just say what to go a trumpet sounds a gospel trumpet a seal is open seal goes all the way back the seal he said a messenger which was Paul picked it up brought the mystery forth there was a group of people that received the mystery of that seal now it wasn't in its completeness but it was for his age it was the seal was open a one seal that's the Seal of the Holy Ghost amen that's right sir exactly right right Glory okay okay this is on page to brother Jose if you can get it introduction revelation of Jesus Christ Church age book chapter one introduction I read this last time now I ask you to take this and bring it inside of you it it is so hard to preach to somebody that knows they know thinks they know everything you don't know everything cuz he doesn't said it's a supernal element not made known to you don't put no period behind and and think about what you know cuz you going to get yourself in trouble with God look at you zarra oh a Godly Man had Godly Parents he was the next thing to in wisdom to Solomon yeah pleased God I mean everything he done he got lifted up in his heart he knowed something he was going to go over and do the priest's job and they told him the PRI the ones that was anointed for that told him no don't come here you are a king stay in your position right he was going to do it anyway brother said he thought he could just do anything he want to go God loved him so much and he died in a leper house the time the moment that he stepped inside that Temple he was strugg with the last stages of Le I didn't say he was lost he wasn't lost but he paid the price and we can go through the Bible go through the look at the look at D the uh first king First Kings 13 the man of God we preach on many times with the word of God doing the works of God and did the works of God God said don't you go back like you come if anybody tries to stop you and talk with you try to talk you out of what you doing or or don't you drink don't do and the old Prophet come said Angel told him me and the Bible said he lied to him right see if God talked to him the first time he could talk to him the second time says now I change my mind like he did with uh uh U Hezekiah right no if God spoke to you and told you to do something you better know the voice right I don't think he going to send nobody else on something like that right well men these glasses get separated a lot of times through this volume we concern itself with various major doctrines now remember in 336 he said is these divinely reveal mrst truths of his coming and remember he said the bride was part of the mystery and must be revealed right that's right the same life the same word the same actions the same everything is what we're to be right to call forth the Dead amen do this this volume we concern said with various major doctr such as the godhead what a baptism you can take water baptism and go to head with it right can you right or or or or is it now listen you you're very fortunate that you got a Sunday school teacher like you got I think personally but but see you know that you can do all that and not even be a Christian right so it keeps him humble it keeps it keeps him laying before God to not to make a mistake that's right not to get exalted or lifted up of what I know what I've did what I do it's me me me no it ain't if you know anything is called God has moved in your life and did it it's him working and living through you that's right what a baptism found in Revelation chap 1 through three it's main thing and God Brother D has preached on this oh Lord I remember when we had it all over the walls yeah so I remember these things and and and remember don't get away from what I said to First what Brother D said he said talk about the Old Testament Saints whatever God ordained them to be he said they achieved that and they and they and we going to talk in just a minute if I can get to it and we going to talk over the rewards of of what they achieved we going to stop it just they can achieve or they're going to achieve he didn't either I'm just the main theme is setting forth of a detailed study of the seven Church ages now I'll say again can you take this church age book I heard brother Dale say and I hope you don't mind me keep calling your name brother he he said when I read the church age book and I put it down and I picked up the seal book and I couldn't understand I picked back up the church CH book that was a purpose God had to pour that foundation in him exactly right he had to pour that his coming the son of man coming is you come into you're coming you're coming into that Supernatural ailment right got this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of Revelations rest of Revelation the entire complete revelation of Jesus Christ person to you in your new birth all the Mysteries so well we don't have to the pastor the ministry has to know all the Mysteries it takes all the Mysteries to make the person of God right see I don't I don't agree with I don't agree with somebody just sitting back on the hands and WR letter just resting on the thumb I stay in desperation you know my wife can tell you and anybody knowes me I can't help it brother Donnie I want to make this change right yeah and if you don't think you can attain to it guess what you ain't going to do it it ain't you I'm depending on him sister Susan he's the one he's my leader right he's posted people for me to hear okay I I'm I'm I'm going fast as I can for for out of the ages comes the seals right out of the ages see what I'm talking about a trumpet would sound a gospel trumpet would sound a seal would open out of the ages a seal would open a mystery would come forth there would be someone to catch it and Paul caught in the first and he would preach it there would be a people that would receive it and be sealed away and a people that reject it and sealed away and a plague falls on them see I ain't got time for that one bring them plagues see it's been going on all the time right you listen under six seal what Brother D been preaching on that on that on those tapes we got it's what 73 of let's do it I wore them out I I even have to run more copies I set right here right here when it was all changed around and him preaching right here me and brother T sitting right here and and he happened to mention 1974 he preached Daniel 70 weeks something run and it thundered y anybody remember that and I said whoa God I mean I and it to put it put me into desperation and I asked him out I said brother you preach them D seven weeks he said I said do you mind if I get them and put them on tape we had them big reels in right amen I don't know about y'all but he h he he laid a foundation to me right absolutely exactly see Daniel said weeks ain't just dates times and Seasons it presents somebody thank and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the V he said this all all all the all them all names is is under those seals under the trumpets I mean it all happens the trumpets and the seals is happening at the same time right seven seal six the uh s trumpet I mean it's if you to would study and show yourself approved unto God you study don't let the ministry do all the studying for you God will put he'll put somebody in this pull pit to say what you have need of but you've got something to do with it if you don't understand it you can he said he would reveal himself to the most illiterate P person I'm I'm I'm figing get in gear first burst of a Roman Candle the church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light right but once the brance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation now listen brother Dale is he preached on first second third chapters of Book of Revelation right you need them you I mean right now you you you need a copy of them right here and take them home with you and when you come back be able to at least recite them I'm telling you I'm I'm can you tell I'm a little bit desperate amen cuz I love you God knows I love every one of you and some of you I make him mad and some of them I'm aggravating I know this cuz that's my type of ministry I can't help what I am yeah but I I'm I I I will not compromise right if I get run off and I told I promised God I said I Walk with You Lord if I by myself if I have to I said I'll walk with you and Buddy you talking about somebody I've been tested by something you you better be careful what you tell God he going to prove you I guarantee you he going to prove he he he'll put your best friend against you he will he turn the church against you he'll make your wife get mad at you too amen but my my M know she's she's a jewel that's see did I yeah that's her but once the brance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light followers until the whole of the Revelation opens wide before our wondering eyes we edified and purified by his Spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our Lord and savior the one true God Jesus Christen I mean there it is exactly right okay I'm going to I'm going to just go ahead uh y'all just stay with me now and I'm I'm going to Brother Joseph I want to uh bring 10 up I'm I just I've got these in uh thing but I've had to shuffle them around because the way I want to bring them and uh this is on the Rapture and I and I'm I'm talking about now I want you to what brother Dale has preached a couple of messes on and uh and I I just want to I know this ain't going to sound right I want to go deeper cuz he's got so much that he's got to carry and it it just and he's got there's Ministries that I got in trouble one time here years and years ago with God I said Lord this is when I was first hadn't been here long and I was preaching here and I said Lord maybe maybe now this ain't going to it probably won't sound right but I said Lord Maybe at least I can help brother Dale oh yeah you know and you know what boy when I went home I got a whooping God says he don't need your help he got me I'm I'm telling you but now it it was something about my attitude maybe I mean I don't know what it was but I tell you what I got a joke to and I said Lord just let me do what you want me to do let me let me just let me do what you want me to do I can say I can say a lot of things I've had people in this church say awful things to me right here right here in this church and all I do is love them amen I've always loved them when they were saying it to me that I loved them but if they ain't got them things out the way I mean if I've got if I've done something I need God you bring it to my attention and I'll get it straight God if it takes the hide off me I'll get it straight but there I'm telling you there's been people that said a lot of bad things to me sometimes when I was in the pull pit and I don't hold nothing against nobody but I do see them and I if I got time I'll tell you a vision it was it was as clear as I'm looking at Brother Sam now it might have been a dream but it was as clear but I mean if I do I I'll I'll I'll tell you this is a dangerous thing Church exactly true it's going to take a complete Revelation that's right the all the Mysteries made to you we don't need to take the Mysteries and and just just deal them out like a dick of cards we don't do that we need to lay before God and let God give us an answer right ain't nobody can do that they can talk to you until they turn perable in the face and if you don't get a revelation of it right you ain't going to see it exactly right so so that's ain't a thing in thew but Satan dealing with you a Son of God and trying to get you you thinking about and going to this one and going to that one and what don't do that go to God Amen okay this is in there this I want to read this now to start if God give me uh Grace here I want you to listen closely now in the Rapture message he said I'm I'm going to read it I'm going just say this he said there's three raptures in the Old Testament right and three raptures ending you exactly now we know that Jesus when he resurrected see he here come Mary Mary Magdalene he said touch me not I haven't yet ascended to my father a sin dead a sin dead to my father and to my God and your God right but when he ascended made the transition he come back say h me sure see but they had the promise this is the only thing I can see this right here they had the promise here here he hadn't come back he was still he he wasn't in the form that he' come in at pentec because which was the son of God but but they could see him they could handle him but once he made his Rapture and come down in in in the form of the Holy Spirit and fill them like I was talking about in Acts two there and filled them with his mortality there with his and his light and started and and start them on their journey and and we are are so fortunate that here we are at the last moments of time and we pick up the message from Pentecost I mean Calvary and we see that Calvary finished it all sir exactly God I wish I had more time but I just ain't now if you want to read in Matthew 18:16 it said there is three that bear record see God had Prophet oh Lord thank you Lord if people gets up there and they preach a whole message that we believe the message we believe the message we believe the message and don't tell you what to message is EXA I I I mean if if I'm obas y'all can tell me and it's good because I want him to believe message but that's like God calling a man to the ministry if he calls a brother to the ministry he gives him a message and it's an end time message right that's right we're waiting on the revelation of the Rapture so what message you re he give us brother B yeah of course we got to come back if there anybody that's that's left out and ain't come to the statute of the perfect man yet the faith of the Father which is a revelation of almighty God but he said there are the Christ the son of the Living God but he didn't say he didn't answer his question who the man say I the son of man him right I tell you it's hard to keep just jumping out there and staying right there but God promis me he he would help me now if you want to read Matthew 18:6 there three that be record in in 1 John 5:7 so forth there is always a witness is that right right it's a ver verification something that's right three Witnesses bear in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let that word be established now now notice we've had three Witnesses three is a witness now we have already had three raptures in the Old Testament right exactly now now listen to this because it's something in here and I may have to get on over in here to get to to more what I'm talking about did you know that as a witness do you know that then if you know that by Revelation then you're a witness of it and part of it the substance is in you revealing it to you you're a part of that as a witness now watch Enoch Enoch was one in the Old Testament now Elijah was the other one see he in Jesus was the other one right Old Testament now now listen to me now people thinks that what Jesus was he he it was Enoch uh Elijah and Jesus but he was a he was he was the first one the what he said he's a keystone between the old and the new and he finished he was finishing up when he said it's finished that was finished all he had to do is go get them right all he had to do is go get them right okay and and this has got something it it types and it brings a perfect type see when they write they put in here the type in anti-type they put a anti why they do that that's opposite that's right a a n t that's it I mean no Revelation right am now notice we've had three Witnesses I seen them already three raps in the Old Testament now let me get Jesus with the other one Jesus being the Keystone and he be record he was a keystone between the Old and New Testament cuz he had to first die and then Rapture he died come to life and walked around here with us oh God something good coming and then was raptured up because he was a keystone remember he ascended up and made the transition but it wasn't a Rapture right right Rapture when the 500 stood out there and watched him go up and he was a keystone that died the two together after his resurrection and Rapture look after he did that and proved that the old test there we all know Enoch was translated we know Elijah was taken out by our world wind that right and a chariot of fire and Jesus died buried Rose and lived here on Earth and then was raptured up the Keystone there's a three to be record of that now now there had been one raptured already passed right where's that what what is that now I want you to think what he said now listen there was Enoch Elijah Lord Jesus Christ and he says that this is a r this is this is the Lord rap He said but there's already been one of the New Testament right there not Jesus he raptured I got something for you here we all know Enoch was translated now there had been one Rapture already you know that and he goes to Matthew 27th chapter I'm I'm going just I I won't go no further than that right there on that one he goes to 27th chapter where many of the saints that slept in the ground their bodies come forth from the grave and come come forth and went into the city showing themselves all right this is uh page nine Brother Joseph now I'm I'm I I I chose that to say that to show you in the Rapture message read the whole message amen the whole message is a Rapture message you want want to know about the Rapture read he said in books and tapes Liv Rapture in faith cuz where you think the ministry is getting it right I just pulling it out of the sky is is God going to Rapture us and we going to be just walking go come like a thief in the night and we going to be walking along he snatch us up no it ain't going to be that way we going to come to a position right and God's going to ra go when I was talk about while ago he when he gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he took his whole armor is wrapped up in that new birth and he begins to spread it out and he and he spread it out and he's wrapping it tighter and buckling it tighter and taking he's he's taking the corruption out and putting Revelation in and and and taking uh Immortal Life out of you and putting mortality in you right getting you ready for the Rapture right can you believe it amen amen you can't do it he said you can't do it you can't attain to it but Jesus Christ is more than able GL we we have something that Sarah and Abraham didn't have they were the type right we are the antitype right we are the fullness of the type we have the entire Revelation from Calvary and not only that but we go back to where Paul got his 14 books from amen where Moses got his five books from we go back before the beginning and see where he put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world because he knew you and he didn't make you do anything every choice you ever made you made it for yourself and he seen that and he elected you right there and put your name on the land book of life because he know the deceitfulness of Satan what he was going to do down here in these last bones of time give me that Revelation uh Genesis 1814 yeah why why did he say what listen listen why did the Bible say we know all that he gave his wife away we know all these things but why did he say blessed a man that God do impute sin because he knew they didn't have the Holy Spirit in their soul they knew that that that that he there was a process had to come through he had why did he let sah put it the same put in our heart to go to to to get Hagar and send him into right Abraham What If Abraham had had the Holy Ghost he said whoa whoa no I one woman and one man if Sarah had had the holy ghost in her soul she' have never sent hagard in there but God had to let it by his permissive will had to let all these things happen to get everything set up that he could come right right that he would give us a revelation that would be so revealed in us that listen and I hate to bring this in when I was in karate I practiced until my you didn't have to tell me nothing it it was just there if four or five come on me it was there how much more would God inside of you right with this revelation of his word Satan is the mightiest one he's is is triple glow and he ain't no match for God and he ain't no match for you listen when some somebody's telling you I me and Danny talks a lot I said Danny keep your attitude right he got something hanging on the wall over there that's what was told to him I said he was fixing to go out west he he was said boy I looked out when I said Danny and and I know that God spoke through me I said Danny you keep your attitude right brother and God will bless you ask him about it I'm still telling him keep your attitud to right and God will he he'll increase that Revelation that you have millionfold right exactly right I mean we it got it comes down to me and God you and God together in there persons okay said now that now oh my God one day there come a blast From Heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first this is on page uh uh Jesus I don't know he's got V V5 n14 178 135 I don't know what they mean I just read it them Old Testament Saints back y who are waiting black I want you to listen now I want I I chose to say this right here for me to go on them whatever you believe where them saints are at it's between you and God it ain't going to put you in hell I'll tell you if if I believe one thing you believe something else but I believe that God has go will bring us to the the Oneness of that right there and we'll both see the truth of it right now listen them Old Testament Saints back Yonder who are waiting a blast forth and come out of there first and go into the resurrection right didn't say they're going to be Resurrection said they go go into the resurrection how many times they got to be God's got a holding place for them we week he God's got a holding place for them foolish virgins right they ain't got the Holy Ghost right amen and and when this is all over and completed everybody on this new Earth is going to have the Holy Spirit and they'll have it in different positions and everybody going to be happy then and satisfied right am no grumbling no death no no Agony sister Susan nothing but pure Bliss right just brother was caught up Beyond a curtain of town for me so he could tell me about it right and it takes a fear of death yes so fear is worry if you fear you worry so quit worrying about Job the things he worried about it come on him right we don't want to do that don't give testimony don't Satan don't need no help right exactly okay Blast for and come out I want you to listen to this now and bl he said who are waiting a blast forward to come out of their first and go into the resurrection will Dro right in line and going to the skies listen listen this right these old Mortal bodies change and made like into his own glorious body now we can say well that was Old Testament Saints let's just read on what a pray that'll be when it starts heavenward we we we have we have got them going see we come up first and they they come in joined in and and and and and we just put come in line and meet the Lord in the there and go Glory see so it don't make no difference wherever they are they would God right going to the skies these see that's why I read uh uh 1 Timothy 6:16 you can't do nothing without God but and it ain't you that does it you submit and surrender to God and God does it and he he'll let you walk a long time he'll let you be tested until you just can't take no more I've been there many times right brother I never get I never really properly thanked you for something you did for me and God seen it when you did it when I was in that hospital with that aneuris they had me throw stuff like a side of beef and you know what Wade come over and hug me up real good and loose me you know that's what the ministry does I appreciate that brother God bless you he has he bless you richly for that you can't do nothing for God's children that's right without God rewarding you that's right see I didn't know it I didn't just know it pegy said I was I know God I'm glad I was out going to the skies these old Mortal bodies changed and made like into his own glorious body what a prayer that'll be when Heaven would some of the days some of these days in the rapturing time that L's head or proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ upon their chest the message of God in the a that they delivered in exactly that was them right they say well what Christ hadn't come Christ always was right exactly he was Michael wasn't he oh god oh read read read the 12th chapter of Revelation and see what Michael done right see what the Christ done you guys you can't just read it and in what we this is what we do we read it in the flesh we don't read it in the spirit right he said whatever you do you sing in the spirit you talk in the spirit You Preach in the spirit you you do everything you you hold your brother's hand in the spirit man am I really hard and loud as I sound I think I am and now the third one is the two witnesses of Revelation 111 and 12 which these are the ones that turns back with the spirit of Christ to witness to the Jews Like Joseph did to his brother right and you remember their dead bodies laid in D for 3 days and a half then the spirit of Life came to them and they were raptured take it up into heaven there's your three Rapture of the New Testament amen I didn't tell you the first one but I'm coming to it three raptures of the Old Testament all of them pass right now we're ready wait the only the only way I can explain that is God sees the end he sees it he sees it off it's finished to God right he's trying to get us to see it's finished there's your three Rapture of New Testament okay now we're ready waiting for raptures the Rapture of the Saints has been spoken so shall it be right well I'll just I'll just okay now I'm going to uh uh page eight uh Brother Joseph now listen we going to get really good in here so you going to have to really think and you going to have to really pray and uh I listen i' I've had this say a long time when you preach and you keep preaching there's people going to get aggravated with you and if you keep preaching they'll eventually get mad yeah and if you and if you keep on preaching they'll hit you in the nose if they get a chance you don't you don't believe that if if if if they didn't think you'd hit them back that that's the only thing holds them back a lot of them I'm telling you that's true Mark you said we we're said there and argue with the preacher can't prove him wrong can't prove him wrong cuz he he bringing it right out of the word and they get mad they got upset we need each other church we need we come come together compactly without without one smidgen of air in in it you take a razor blade and you can't run between us until we come to this place that we love one another so much like Jesus he says you'll know that that people will know you my disciples by the love you have one for another amen that's right okay here we go uh this is on course 65 1204 170 130 ever what that means what in the Old Testament them Old Testament Saints there when this Rapture first taken place listen slow down if your guys are getting your eyes getting sleepy open them up yeah now the Old Testament says now when this Rapture first taken place notice verse 50 his loud voice awaken the Old Testament Saints exactly like the loud voice awaken Jesus or awaken Lazarus now the Lord himself shall descend with a shout right and he woke us up gospel shout I'm going I'm going to try to just read see the loud voice awaken and the second is fulfilled in 1 Thessalonians 4th chapter let's just take a read we just read it a few minutes ago see I would not have you ignorant brother concerning those that sleep that you s not that I that I that's 1 Thessalonians 4:128 that that will be the second Rapture yeah now one's done happen I ain't told you that one yet but I'm coming to it I ain't talk about the Lord Jesus Christ we know he raptured right the second Rapture will be a catching away of the Bride sure first Thessalonians the Old Testament Saints has gone into his presence now there was only one more way they could go into his presence because brother Brandon could not go into the almighty God the Lord Jesus Christ's presence because he was still in his theophany and the scri he would have broke the scriptures scripture said I won't eat I won't eat of or drink of the fruit of the vine and that was them sitting there I won't I won't do this until I do it with in my father's Kingdom and so he had to come he he he'll have to come by us reaching the place and God speaking the Rapture into existence and and and when he comes down here and takes up that glorified body he can go into the presence of God then and not till then see we are these bodies are still a prisoner of what Adam and Eve done right but what I've been talking about by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's bringing in in sub submission and eradicating what she caused and somebody's coming back to the position because God himself promised it he said he could reveal how many times well I think this is what we need to hear no we need to search God and find out what God wants us to say up in this P pit i i f this I I didn't I wasn't going to do it but God God come to me and and here he was with Isel and he brought it to me he brought this to me he said watch what of the night he said if you don't tell them their blood's going to be on you but if you do tell them and they turn it down the blood's on them now that's for each one of you I'm not tell about own you and yet it is but see the holy spirit in you makes you a Watchman do you watch for your wife a wife do you watch for your husband are you out somewhere and somebody say something the Watchman comes forth which is the Holy Ghost and tell somebody why you got long hair why you got long dresses and why you you're you're serving the god the way you are Watchman what of the night if you don't tell them pray pray right to God what would you have me say when you get up in theor what would you have me do Lord what what Lord God I've done so little for you amen right sir I heard brother Brown say that's oh Lord God oh my where does that put me I'm sorry I I got to the loud voice awaken is fulfilled in first Thessalonians the Old Testament Saints has gone into his presence Paradise done away and the Old Testament Saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and give up the ghost because why the sacrifice their propitiation of their sins that they had waited on believing that perfect lamb was coming that offered the sacrifice of the lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he scream with a loud voice voice and the Old Testament Saints awoke once to shout and the voice over here the same thing the voice Bob the voice the voice that God had you to speak of it ain't just his natural voice though it was a voice of God but see you went deeper and you was talking about God speaking through you taking your vessel and living a life speaking through you right the same thing at his coming see yielded up The Ghost and when he did the sacrifice was perfect now listen and Paradise emptied out why because what you done watch and the Old Testament Saints came to the Earth again walked around on Earth and entered in with him at his Rapture David said over there lift up your evation Gates and be lifted up he led captivity captive and give gifts unto men now what does he mean by that he loose them from that prison that their bodies was in cuz they come up in in from the graves in their bodies so say the scriptures we going to argue with scripture I ain't I'm going to just say what what the Bible says what brother Brown said and we all learn we all have to stand correction especially me and remember this here and the Old Testament Saints has gone into his presence now that's got a real significance here believe in the perfect lamb was coming the old T he says and Par and when he did the sacrifice was perfect Paradise emptied out and the Old Testament Saints came to the Earth again and walked around at his Rapture okay the Lord Of Glory Mighty and host Mighty host and here they come in marching Jesus led captivity captive he he loosed their captivity and captivated them with himself if it Ain you somebody got another explanation of that I that's all all I can see and here he come with the Old Testament Saints and went into the new gates up there and said lift up ye Everlasting Gates and be ye lifted up and let the king of glory come in the voice coming from the inside say who is a king of glory the lord Mighty in battle the gates flew open and Jesus the Conqueror LED captive them that had believed on him and the word had come to them there the Old Testament Saints laying in their waiting he led captivity captive ascended on high took the old Testament Saints and went in there's a Rapture already passed first Rapture of the New Testament meditate on it CU we're tied together until like Brother D say he says they without us can't be made perfect so we we have to obtain this place to get to get to to the Rapture to come to bring it all but see they not made perfect until this I mean totally perfect now and and no neither nobody else until this thing is over because they still two witnesses has got to be raptured right and then and there's white thrown judgment the foolish virgin is going to be given eternal life and then we'll go to the well the millennium's over then we'll go to the new city and everybody's going to be in their positions perfect right there that's what we that's what we've done brother that's what we're do we they without us can't be completely perfect it ain't just them resurrect or coming forth cuz we go all the way to the end with it right yeah I lost my glasses again okay the ne he said that one Rapture has already passed the next Rapture takes place in second Thessalonians for the church the bride to be be resurrected and to be raptured in glory we would your alive remain that's the body left on Earth will not prevent our h of them are asleep for the trumpet of God shall s the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught together with them in a now listen Okay okay I'm I want to read this one on page TW 12 Brother Joseph I'm going to try to get in the hurry I don't know how how long I'm going how can I overcome there is that elected that bride now what what you call him there is that elected that bride not all of the Jewish Church come forth at that time right all of them made the same sacrifice all of them was under the shed blood of the lamb but there was an elected group right now brother Brown I I say this because brother Brown said he said every congregation Believers make Believers unbelievers always would be that ought to make us desperate right there right that ought to make us desperate and that elected group as soon as the event come that really believed in it with sincerity now I'm coming to the word over overcome now hold that these that had really overcome sincerely make it I'm talking about us now now this is talking about them but I'm talking about me and you right sincerely he's going to take sincerely desperation to bring us into this position that they was in for their group sincerely making the same offering that the rest of them made but in sincerity overcome the things of the world when the propitiation correctly was made for them they were in Paradise until that PL until that play at that time when the time was made they had overcome and was resting sleeping many B slept in the dust he slept now how can I overcome now if we had time we could go back and see Daniel when Daniel that that elected one that had overcome close up the book Daniel for you shall rest in thy lot now what does that lot mean yeah but when the prince shall come which shall stand for the people Thou shalt stand in that lot here it is Daniel this prophet of God saw the end time coming and he said Daniel you'll stand in your lot at that day at that day when you resurrect from there God is standing right there on this Earth and job said I know my redeemer 8:19 chapter I know my redeem in this flesh I'll see him on this earth right and there was a prophecy fulfilled on that right there the prophet of God saw the end time I see them and here he was come forth not all of Israel but the bride type of Israel right the elected group The elect they was elected for that position so they they're not Lessing us they just chosen for something else we're chosen as his bride Glory I believe we're special but to me I can't wait to hold hands with them amen God i' I've I read the Bible I read the message and I see what God's prophet say and he Thrills my soul that one of these days you know one of my favorite persons in in the whole entire Bible is stepan he stood there and he looked up in the heavens open right he seen the Lord stand there at the right hand the power of God and he was standing in them rocks hitting them like feathers yeah oh God he says and he told him what he was looking at amen Bo I I want to say I can't wait because I I I want to I want to I'll wait Al it takes but the bride type of Israel now the rest of Israel don't come forth until the general Resurrection so he's talking that's who he's talking about now see the Rapture our Rapture will be like that we'll see each other and we'll see them the rest of the world won't see them see we're like them we follow them I mean we do like them but they come to us right it'll be caught away as a secret going waiting for that time then returning back to the Earth for that glorious Millennium then the Thousand Years the rest of De live live for a thousand years I'm reading fast I can church this is in now I really want I want to read a little note I got here before I read in t Inon Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 380 there is a time there would come a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity see is godhead deity and as that is the godhead deity through his church see we're a part of the mystery and must be revealed and it's going on now there very few people very no wonder he says except the Lord short day would no flesh be saved right he I mean he he's got just a just a minute few what it is is if it all over the world is still a few compared to what's been in in the world says through his church have preeminence in this this church the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom for accepting what Eve turned down right God Almighty okay let me get started here that's in uh uh 8539 39 of what that means I wish somebody tell me what them things mean I mean it it don't it may be paragraphs I don't know but 85 well you know actually this this message in tuming is in uh Church in Israel it's in there it's if you if you'll get the book it's it's three or four different message in it from 61 to 67 is in tement you need to read it exactly you need to read every one that I'm giving you you see when that seed was promised in the Garden of Eden see it started he says that I your you your he Breo his head and his his head I mean you know you know what it said right you see that when that seed was promised in the garden the devil has constantly tried to destroy that seed and the devil of Abel and the coming of Seth were just a death burial and resurrection of Christ the seed must continue and to this day he said and and he's given on this page here he's telling he's describing hail he says and he he I w't I won I'll just skip over that right there about he he took the keys of death and hell away from him he said Peter had the keys of of of the kingdom and here he starts up it's getting Easter time passing fast but there's another group where's job where's Abraham where are they at where's those Fells that trusted God's word has he forgotten them did Death annihilate them was that all of it never never God has to keep his words I can see him that's like a little peep into paradise and look over there and I see Sarah and Abraham walking around there yeah and after a while Bram knocks something on the door Abraham goes and opens the door and says honey come here look at here that's this very same one that stood with me under that Oak day it's he's Abraham's God and that's why I say that that that he said when he he'll reach over and take he said come here I mean you you can shake him that way so so I mean he God is placing and showing us what has happened yeah now just then I can see Daniel look over his should and say that's the rock that was HED out of the mountain just as certain as I'm standing here I see job raise up and said that's my redeemer that I said I knew that lived and someday he stand upon on this Earth yeah now we ain't talkinging about the Millennium now and and I I want you to understand something don't get this mixed up with the F sealed juice this ain't the F sealed juice and and a lot of people do that brother brother Sam they just don't know they just flump them all together my body may not be but a little Spoonful Of Ashes but in 15 minutes from now I'll be in it again that that's him Ezekiel looked over the top and said I've seen that same person as a wheel in the middle of the wheel right turning up in the middle of the arrow my then up comes Enoch an said I saw him coming with 10,000 of his Saints to execute judgment there was the Old Testament Saints waiting sure they was under the atonement listen closely under the atonement of blood they could not go into the presence of God you see why I I said Abraham couldn't go into the presence of God he could because these these here something transpired there cause is watch it the atonement of blood they could not go into the presence of God God Of Heaven because goat and sheep blood could not take away sin now listen right but he said my brethren I am the one that you think I am I am the seed of the woman I am the son of David I am the Son of God I am the Virgin born one my blood has atone for it you waited under the blood of sheep and goats but now my blood atones and you free let's go up right what does that mean to you what does that mean to you he said that he said my blood has atoned for you that's what he's saying he says you're free cause my blood that's when he saided it he said it's finished right that's finish and I'm and I'm I'm to start on finishing this one ah it's getting go for quiet in here I am the Son of God I am the Virgin one my blood has a home for it you waited under the blood of sheeps and goats see that he couldn't they under sheeps and goats you couldn't go into his presence right it had to be the blood the lamb himself SL was was was bled right but now my blood atones and you're free let's go up it's getting late it's getting almost easier just think that was about 19900 years or some ago just thought I'd get that out to you I mean I listen I'm not trying I'm just I'm just preaching the word I'm just preaching the word you got to get your own Revelation that's what the that's what the ministry does it brings it brings it it comes forth right there it comes over you you can have it if you want if you don't have it you need to get desperate about it uh okay I can hear Abraham say Lord when we get up in our body again Sarah and I just loved it so well do you mind if we take a little Whistle Stop kind of on your road you know and he said Matthew 27 that many of the saints that slept in the dust of Earth arose and come out of the graves who was it Abraham Isaac Jacob job those who by spiritually reveal Revelation know that the Redeemer would stand on the earth someday right that's them listen that's them the first fruits of those that slept let me tell you something Jesus Christ before this right here he before he resurrected his body was laying in that tomb dead he had to resurrect too and that's what every we have a spiritual Resurrection before there's a natural resurrection and a Rapture then that's them theer fruits of those that slept there they walked in the city I can see AB Sarah and Abraham young and full of and handsome and full of life never to be old no more never to be sick no more never to hunger no more walking around in their body caler standing there you know we're going to have to get someone to sew that curtain up and he go on Abraham and Sarah we're recognize we better get out appeared to many there wasn't all of it enclosing watch one day when after he had they had visited Abraham Isaac Jacob and all of them had visited their Homeland When Jesus ascended up remember he ascended and took the transition and come back and and now here he is over here with 500 watching him and I don't know if there's anybody else out there not I 500 a lot of people but he went up he ascended up in a Rapture but the first one he Ascend it up to make a transition back into where he would come from okay where am I at when he began to go here this is it why I just got ahead him and said you say brother Brandon is that mythical no sir I'll show you in the scriptures in just a minute when he began to go up they only seen him but the Old Testament saints went w went with him for the Bible said that he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men and I can see him as he goes up and joins with his church two angels out of the band that were playing the music come back there and said ye men of Galilee why stand you looking up for this same Jesus that was taken up is coming again and February 28th 1963 he come in a cloud of again that he went up here and he come back again am and he revealed them Thunders and he's here right he's here Amen brother they can't preach themselves it's God in him that does it and I'm I'm just not just picking on him I'm talking about any of us God give us a message and it's part of the resurrection message take it up and comeing certainly they heard back to join the he said you've been at what stand you looking up for the same Jesus that was taken up his coming again certainly they heard back to join The Possession and down through the sky Jesus and the Old Testament went they passed the moon they passed the sun they passed the stars and when they got inside that great beautiful white Heavens the Old Testament Saints screamed out quoted scripture lift up you Everlasting Gates and be you lifted up lift up you Everlasting Gates and be you lifted up and let the kingom glory in all the Angels gathered up on top of the banner of Heaven he's he's he's trying to make a picture for it who is this the old Testament Saints the Lord of hosts Mighty in battle he was a conqueror I'm I'm ain't got about 12 more pages here not just teasing this is a what I have we got three more the angel pressed the big button the ply gate swung open right down through the city of Jerusalem came the Great Mighty Great Mighty conqueror bringing the Old Testament Saints Angelic bands are playing as angels are shouting he was a mighty conqueror he had the keys of death and Hell hanging on his side going right down a pass the Palaces of Glory till he got to the throne he said father here they are they believed in faith on your word that I'd come someday I have conquered both death and hell what was it brother he had a scars in his hand to show that he had been in battle glory to God to the highest he is that Mighty conqueror here they are Father Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he he goes on he said that in in the one limb there he said he was an ID when he was was in the Tomb we think he was just laying there dead but he was down still conquering he went down and took the keys away from Satan he got the keys of both death hell tonight he said because I leave you and he's give them keys to us right whatsoever you bind in heaven I'll bind in Earth what you to Loos and I'll loose we to come to the position brother exactly right if you don't think you can do it you ain't going to do it right right this is a this is Israel at the Red Sea this is a good one Along Came Jesus the promised one they done to him what they said they would do oh they killed him he died his soul descended into hell preach to the souls that are in prison taking the keys of death and hell away from the devil don't that just make you want to shout Satan can't do one thing to you that God don't let happen and if he lets it happen is to test you and bring you in he beating that go into a pure goal or let me say it this way pure God so it's so hard for us to see that these things that happens to us and and and operations and uh uh all these things and some to more look at job I mean a perfect man God said for his day and and and and he and he held his testimony and though he he ready hide me in the grave till these things be gone that's how bad it got it's just by being that bad for me at times I'll be honest with you when you can't see he'll let you go right to you till you just I mean you just you it's all right Lord but then all at once Peggy come in my my my mind I said God I can't go now nless I I take her with me right right I can't my dogs I got my dogs I don't know how that's going to work but I'm going to have them my cat too that I lost I'm going to have them Bown had his horse and his dog I'm going to have mine I believe everything ever loved you ever and ever you ever loved see I ain't just saying that was for brother BR cuz God ain't no respect to a person okay I'm I'm finishing up here he is so descended to Hell preach to the souls that are in prison taking the keys of death head away from devil now listen every the end of every man it's always been this way it's end of a Ministry you're preaching until the totally lost he said he said in his word he said in in quotes I my mind's on this right here now he said in the last days God would witht take his Spirit from the earth now we know he said he ain't going to leave you forsake you seemingly he said now the bride will stay while preaching to the totally lost he said cuz it must be it's end of every ministers that way I mean we don't want to think to that way because we we but we just do what we can do and be the lead of God see we need to be the lead of the Holy Spirit every time we walk in that door we ought to be prayed up and in desperation right and you don't believe it'll work let him get behind that pull pit and let and him come out and and win that and see and see what God will do for us try it one time just try it what you got to lose well I don't know I better not say that either cuz if if if you doubt it brother said if God spoke to you through somebody and says you heal right thus say the Lord you heal and you doubt it he said it's going to happen anyway but you going to answer for your unbelief now I mean he said it I'm telling you what he said now there they are the Old Testament Saints laying there waiting to be clothed upon in Paradise he opened up the door Abraham said are we going out it's almost daylight on Earth let's get ready to go Abraham said can we make a little wh stop he's talking about that Matthew 27 says and many of the bodies of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth Rose and came out of the city and appeared to many in the city I can see saor and Abraham coming down the street saying oh honey look there they've changed these things a little bit look around see here how this looks somebody said who is that couple there it seems like they're strangers they said we're recognized brother Brown snaps his finger vanished out of their sight like he went through the wall you know and they didn't even or see him come in went out they had glorified bodies I don't have no problem with that I don't have a bit of problem with that whatever they are God has made them and wherever they are God's got them in a ho because they resurrected I don't how he said well no nobody has reached immortality God has finished the work for these people he's finished for them all they got to do is come now they I know they don't have to be resurrected because you don't it but when see God don't resurrect theophanies theophanies don't die only bodies is resurrected so I'm not saying I don't uh I've got my thoughts on it but uh but I I'm I'm I want to say just what the prophet said and then we we need a revelation because he is a keystone between the old and the new they're part of us they come out of the same dirt that we did they was predestinated for a place we are predestinated for place and then when we finish our predestination here we going up and they coming forth that's what I'm looking at it don't make any difference if they're if they're what they're with God cuz I can show you right here he took them into the kingdom with him now what kind of I mean I don't know but uh but I know what I think but I I just I just I don't want to say what I think yeah I don't want to do that okay brother Brown snaps his fingers they had glorified bodies and they appeared back on Earth Hallelujah for a first fruits of the proof of God's power and the resurrection there they was robbed and stri Prince ales PR and took death and hell and smothered it up and Rose up on the Easter morning and entered into the kingdom with him no wonder they said bury me in Palestine they know that the resurrection was going to there now now remember what I first said what I said you remember what I first said when I first started about what brother Dale was preaching can anybody remember just hold you don't say nothing just hold your hand up if you remember what he said I said it I don't know how many times he says whatever God called them to they achieved it exactly and that's what I that's where I've been coming all day see people people everybody in here ought hold hands up everybody in here ought to hold hands or get to this Altar and pray to God show me Lord I've staggered around long enough not knowing right I listen to this one I listen to that one this one says this says that not knowing they may be saying the same thing yeah and and if you ain't careful you'll drive a wedge in between them don't do that it's God you talking about and he's not he's not he's not somebody you can play with you got to come according to the word right the word is a judge not me not brother de brother brother Wade brother Bob right we're not judges but the word that comes forth from us the word is the judge he goes out right there that if you receive it you can you can have it if you believe if you really truly believe in a prophet and everything he says you can have the reward of that prophet and the reward of that prophet is a full Revelation that he preached amen exactly y'all excuse me boy I get excited I mean it's it's it's just good always to the Bone to me I mean I've I've wrestled with this said God I've had God said me one time I got wrote I got wrote down hold your peace hold your peace I'll let you know when I can show it to you not not say somebody's wrong I ain't saying that but see it's time you have to wait on God right what you what do you think brother Dale does you think he don't wait on God that he don't talk to God every day and every night when he wakes up I know I do I'm not just exalting brother brother brother Sam I'm just telling you what we all ought to be we ought to all be so desperate to see the first resurrection cuz the first first part of the of the Old Testament was Enoch Elijah the Lord Jesus Christ and when Lord Jesus Christ went up in the Rapture the Old Testament Saints raptured with him that was the first of the New Testament If It Ain't So show me show me or either Jesus made two raptures and we know he didn't do it he didn't do it he was sended up and trans transformed himself or how you say that into where he come from and come back and allowed and allowed the people to touch him and to eat fish and all to show them what is going to be one of these days but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost come say one word against that he you know he said you you say word against me I forgive you but when he comes now he's here tonight right he's here the heir of all things is here in the form of the son of man in flesh that's the son of man is in flesh he was in flesh then s Susan he's in flesh now when he was the F the word was in his flesh and he was the flesh I mean the word was the flesh right there then when he comes in you then your flesh becomes the word right people don't believe that well I can't do that you no you're right but God can okay let's see then and he's talking about watch out Sarah we been noticed this Spirit like Christ did coming through the walls glorified body well I think I'm just about to give out but I I want you to oh god well I try church I just I just it's it's such a blessing to uh to be stand here with you because of and and and I I've give you things that's been on this right here that you need to study you need to take it to heart you're to you're you're on this introduction Revelation Jesus Christ God has preached the word to us about all of this if you go to to Revelation 12 and I let me do it just just one second you won't T it it a minute and let's see what Michael done seventh chapter the seventh verse the 12th chapter now if you could go to the to and the woman fled Into the Wilderness see but you got to read between the lines God that the between the lines is the revelation of this book he says now listen and and there was war in heaven I got my finger on me predestinated child of God which his name's put on the Lamb's Book of Life and when I was justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost it's start the war yeah Christ was in me called the Holy Ghost and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels and the angels of the Lord encamped about those who fear and love the Lord and I told you why the Angels was camped around him so he's not going to let Satan do and his Devils do any more to you except he's got his hand on it right and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon my whole my whole life brother Bob since I come to since I come to God has been a battle I have fought and it's amazing that the people that has that that has come against me and and and and and I said Lord they didn't mean that they wouldn't have never done that if if they they Satan just got them Hoodwinked but got to got to take that hood wink off of him if you've done something to somebody get it clear cuz he'll meet you somewhere right it'll meet you Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought fought and his angels every devil in hails against us as a one person right can you imagine what this man all these years can you imagine I wouldn't trade places with him unless I mean Lord I'd be like that song that they was going to send him to to Africa he said Lord don't send me to Africa he said they lions and tigers and snakes please don't send me I send me to the Baptist Church you know but don't send me to Africa not just teasing I'm sorry and his dragon fult in his Angel and Prevail not right see this is where you come brother Bob when this is going forth when you coming forth that you are prevailing that in and God wants you to see that and somebody ought to tell you about it right you can preach a message and go out that door and nobody say nothing I remember when we was talking we'd hit that door right there and we were talking from the street up everybody was talking about God you can't hardly get them out out of a the stream fishion or or the deer stain and and and ain't nothing wrong with that but like brother Dale said he takes his iPod with him or whatever he takes and and and you ought to be let me finish this up right quick and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and that I brought that down to you to you personally to you that Michael is standing up in you and had been there since the new birth fighting for you and let just like the Prince of Persia withheld Gabriel from coming and Michael had had to come to loose him and say so Satan can't do nothing to you except God backs his hand off a little bit cuz you got a plan in a purpose for you and Prevail not neither was their place how Oh Glory to God listen this sister Mon and neither and and and Prevail not neither was there a place found anymore in heaven right you hear me right neither was a to the dragon in I didn't say he wasn't coming against you I didn't say he wasn't beating on you but he got no part of and you see cuz you say your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the elected of God he chooses by election and now I'd like to preach a message on that right quick but uh God bless you they all stand I'm sorry I kept you longer than I thought it GNA do but 12 pages I knew it was gonna I talk I I I used talk so much but I love God I I God I I I I want to I want to tell you listen and I'm speaking for the ministry they want you to see they know that that it's it's time the whole world is falling apart it's in a Sodom and condition as it was in the days of no the whole world but see that ain't got nothing to do with us he said but he did say this he says these horrible things will be happening here while we're still here right but before the first bomb Falls he said we'll be gone we ain't going to be pressured out we're going to be pressured up right amen God bless you let's pray father Lord we approach that Throne again a mercy again
