the the shower inside all right amen I think I've about all of them but just pray for one another trying to look down the list to see going write down because I can't remember always but let's look at Job the 7th chapter and if he will run it on down to verse 11 11 where we'll start from and uh then to go on from 11: through about 17 and it'll be easier if you will brother let's pray before we read

guide now in Jesus name amen yeah we just jump down to verse 11 to save time reading because it'll get the point of what we're doing then we want to go over to job 15 and pick up a couple more verses all right therefore I will not refrain my mouth I will speak in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soul am I a sea or a whale that thou set us to watch over me when I say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint then thy scarth me with dreams and terrifies me through w v Visions so that my soul chooses strangling and death rather than my life I lo it I would not live always let me alone for my days are vanity what is man that thou should us Magnify Him and that thou should us set thine heart upon him let's go on down to read the next one and that thou should us visit him every morning and try him every moment go over now to the 15th I just want to pick up something a little thought here from our scriptures today and try to carry on what we've been dealing with so we'll go to the 15th chapter verse 14 what is man that thou should us that he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous behold he putteth no trust in his sa yay the heavens are not clean in his sight how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh iniquity like water let's just stop right there you may be seated the Lord have his Blessing to the reading of the word now job we know is one of the listed as one of the great wisdom men of the of the Bible and uh great understanding and if you read he's in a turmoil and you know in these things and his buddies comes to try to condemn him for thinking that you know he at one time he had all kind of animals he had all kind of of uh doings he had uh seven kids I think it was and God took all of them from him and left him sitting on an ash Heap you know out cuz that was the way they would set back then when things would go wrong and had balls you know risings all over him and and things like that and it looked like that he had uh you know done something wrong but he's putting forth his answer back to these that condemn him and and he's telling them about what is man now that's what I want you to think about today because we've been in our studies now we we've come through for quite a while speaking about heaven and then coming down to earth and and picking up the creation of the earth and and bringing it forth to see how that it God in his wonderful Beauty made such a beautiful place and and everything for us to live on and then coming on down to sin and what was the original sin as we covered in in our life message and we know that the original sin was to disbelieve God's word all right anytime you doubt God's word as being true cuz that's what he said to Eve now we can go into the uh thing and we know and believe what happened in the garden but that was a manifestation of the unbelief that she had within her heart because she disbelieve God when God said you can eat of all of the fruit of the of the trees and everything but said just leave the one in the M of The Garden Alone well that wasn't no apple tree or a p or a peach or some kind of a tree that was there because it was an oddl looking tree if you look at it because it was said the Bible said it was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's right so it would have to be something other than a natural apple tree but we covered those things but the main thing I wanted you to see is that she disbelieved God's word when he said you eat thereof that day you die right all right she disbelieved God's word she doubted God keeping his word all right so that would be the original sin now the attribute see that's what I've tried to bring to you that the attributes see was what was displayed but she originally disbelieved inside of her and then she displayed the the rest with her life but her unbelief is the the m thing and that's our problem today because that's you know that's where we stand we have a right today to believe what God says or doubt what he says and if we doubt what he says because of any reason or any thought whatsoever then that would make us an unbeliever just like it was in the original then we'll go out and do things that are wrong because we're an unbeliever that's that's the display we look at down and and seeing what happened in the garden and we can say well it was this and some says it was this and some says it was that but you know my main point of what I'm getting at is unbelief right to disbelieve God's word right now when God says that by Stripes I'm Healed that's right I must say what he says that's right all right because if I don't say what he says how can he ever heal me so I must take his word and just stay on that irregardless of what anything takes place and then just say what he says because not see then I'm doubting what he says so is it with salvation if you need salvation then take God at his word he ask him to save you and then take him at his word and say thank you Lord for saving me right all right then the rest of it God will take care of if we believe him and Keep On Believing him but our problem is we believe today and then some little something goes wrong and you know it's just like being sick we we say well well thank you Lord for healing me all right we feel better maybe we feel better and start doing pretty good all right just in a little bit everything start going wrong but when it does then we start doubting whether or not we're healed and that's where the problem it so is it with salvation do you doubt whether or not God saved you then what he's he makes intercession the Bible says Upon Our confession all right so if we confess that we're healed we're healed we confess we're saved we're saved right all right now the difference in healing and salvation healing is on a a temporary basis which means you can be healed and then get sick again but in Salvation you you don't lose your salvation so what you do is you confess until God accepts your confession as being what you believe then he comes and gives you an answer back which is the new birth coming to live within us all right and we'll get more down to that later but I want to just deal with something because we've dropped down from the the the creation and things and I want to just deal with what is man and I just want you to think about yourself you know what is man that a great man like that see we generally want to run run over to Hebrews and and take up the Life part of what he was doing but remember now job is not the one that Paul is picking up in Hebrews he's picking up from the psalmist David when he's confessing and he's talking about and he said what is man the dark mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him but here in job he just simply saying what is man he said am I seea or am I whale or you know what am I what's the difference in me and a dog you know what's the difference in a human being and a dog you know well we walk upright and they cry well sometimes look like they're pretty smart too but yeah that's what I want to get to what is man I wanted just to just to talk about it and then you'll easily see if you watch what I'm getting at you'll easily see what the fall of Man is and you'll easily see then what uh what I was saying a moment ago that we must confess right we must believe we must confess and we must keep our confession God if we doubt our own confession what what's any need saying it that's right you know I mean what's any need in talking about anything if we're not going to believe what we say that's right that's right and and and you know we as human mortal we want to be to the basis of of taking somebody's word sometimes that may be hard to do but yet still you know we should take one another's Worden well that's where I've been told said but you you you got a problem because you believe what people say I believe what people say until it's proved wrong what's wrong with that you know I mean I can go say what you you say you're not guilty of committing a crime well I say Well they're not guilty well then the court says they are guilty well that's their business I'm just saying what you told me see I want to confess what God says right you understand cuz in that way then I can depend upon him to keep his word why because he's going to come back to my word right see that's why in U what is it Romans with a heart you believe mouth you confess all right but now I want us to look just simply at man we talked about in our last message of how that you got a deal there or a part in Genesis that you got a part in Genesis 126 and 27 where it talks about you know that God created man in his own image all right now then you go over to Genesis 2:7 and he creates the natural man well God made a spiritual man Adam in his own image all right which was a spirit man okay but then Genesis 2 he made the natural man and that's where the confusion with mankind is they'll read it and they wonder which way was what oh it's very simple one was the spiritual man the other one was the natural man the spiritual man was to rule over the animals and the things as God ruled the natural man then was put into the garden to till the soil to to uh to do the things you know and not from the sweat of his brow but because of of uh you know doing what he wanted to do I don't believe Adam had to get out there every day and dig ditches and you know and plow the mules and things he didn't it wasn't that way but he was put there to to be over the garden right all right if he wanted the tree moved all he had to do was say move right he didn't have to dig it up and replant it right you know he could just say move because why he was in the image of God all right but now we saw that the fall of Man you know when the fall came it put all mankind into a condition or an existence that made us all lost all right the psalmist David said we were born in sin sh in iniquity a spoused my mother's wound and and went forth Liars that's putting like three scriptures together all right see then man he he's a wonderful thing he's made the highest form the lastest one that was made all right God made all the animals and made things then he made man all right and he put him here for a special purpose that even you see that purpose and that idea in mind as you see him that he's in the image of God Amen that the animals they build their nest the same way they do everything the same as they used to 2,000 years a bird still builds his nest you know now you can stand out there all you want to and tell him he don't need to do that he he's not going to listen to you you know he's going to go on and build that nest and he's going to do everything the same now there's certain ways you can train animals to a degree to get them you know in a different way but that's what I want you to look at what's the difference in us and an animal all right because that animal as I said he can be trained to a certain degree but that's as far as he can be trained now naturally they've got animals now that can talk you know you ever heard a dog talk I have we used to hunt with a guy and and he he had trained a dog and the dog was little old uh Chihuahua and he'd say booger booger you know and you can understand it they've got dogs that can say words enough to do but it's because of what they've been constantly trained all right now in doing those things then see we are the highest form that was created and we only look at the spiritual creation of man as to try to get it into the image of God but I want you to look at the natural part of you as I said what is it that makes you so different what is it that makes us different from the animals that even in the fall in state of man look at the animals they're still under our domain we can take as I said and train things train animals to do things cuz it's repetitive repetitive repetitive until it finally will start doing those things but you know in doing it that animal can't reason out anything that's right that's right I've always said if a if a turkey could smell like a deer you know the ability nobody to ever kill a turkey that's right well because their eyesight is so great and their hearing is so great until I mean you move a finger at 100 yards and they can see it all right but see God made each one of them and he placed it into each animal to be what he is and you know but that animal still can't reason out things that's right so he's not in the image of God Even in our fallen estate that's what I want you to get to CU once we fail everybody failed it wouldn't just half of us fail amen you know a lot of people like to try to make two lineages and come down and try to make some kind of a beast lineage and a human lineage and all and don't worry about it we'll get to it more this afternoon then once you come on over to the time of the flood you can't separate none of the lineages whatsoever so you might as well just leave it alone but my point this morning is one thing God made a man the highest form of animal cuz that's what we are right we're the highest form of animal that exist right but the difference between us and an animal you know Birds deer dogs cats whatever monkeys I know they're close and I agree that sometimes we act like monkeys ourselves but that still doesn't make us one and but in all of that man was placed and made here for a specific purpose amen you look at him he can think things out that's his problem he can reason it out right that can be wonderful but it also can be damaging because he was given that ability and even though in his Fallen estate Even in our lost estate we have great abilities there's people that can actually take and and B metal this is not jokes Bend metal break glass Etc with from a a part of you that's called a soul it's almost to the day now that we're living they have soldiers today that can run almost full out for almost 24 hours Elite forces that is can do almost impossible things controlled their body so much until it it it's a amazing because they've learned to do that they've built that up over a period of time like a uh uh we shoot guns a lot and and I teach the kids to always did coming down and and try to with anybody that shoots you know when you're shooting a gun you don't want to be breathing while you're shooting because it's going to throw you off just a hire but you'll miss your target so what you do is you take a deep breath or either you blow out either way you want to do it but then you hold yourself all right there's people now that are called Sharpshooters that can actually control their own heart rate now I'm just getting the point of man all right just listen they can control their heart rate because even a heartbeat shooting a th000 yards and your heartbeat being fast it can throw you off enough to you just a high is all it takes and you'll almost miss the target th000 yards away but there's people that can shoot that way there's people that can shoot for Miles because they've learned to control theirselves all right now if we could do that in the natural how much would it be if we can get into the spiritual with God to be able to do those things is my point that we'll get back to but I want you to think about it see no matter what you are you're a Son of God right by your natural creation right now you notice the way I said it natural creation you're actually a creation of God who created us the devil certainly can't create right people say the devil made me do this let's don't blame the devil for everything right all right we got to volunteer that's what I was getting out about Eve to start with hey she not volunteered to listen to the devil through that serpy then it wouldn't have been any problem but that's what I want you to get at is think about you and what you are and I believe this will help us to understand salvation and the way that it works upon us and what is happening in life cuz that's my point not to just preach a message about people and what they are but we're the highest form of animal you take a a a a bar and you skin it down and you lay a child down beside of it and they look almost identical take the skin off the bar you know thing why because we're just a higher form of animal but yet God chose to make us that way and he placed within us a soul now what is a soul the word soul is interchangeable with Spirit you can use the word Spirit Soul interchangeably coming through the Bible but you get over like David as we'll get to it in a minute he said my soul thirth after to thee Oh God see there's something about Mankind and the way he's made he's made to serve God right God wanted Fellowship amen he could fellowship with the animals that was fine he could come down every day and talk to the bar the the dogs the lines of things he could fellowship with but yet that wasn't what he wanted forgive me he wanted something in more closer to him to he create a man and that man then being more into his likeness he could have Fellowship right he could talk with him amen like a prophet said he came down in the cool of the day in the garden and he spoke to Adam and Eve fellowship with him forgive me they still can't figure figure out what I'm doing yet I've been to all kind of doctors to try to find out what this problem is but they can't find it out so I know what it is is Satan trying to cut off my voice that's all right I'll whisper if I have to but get this you don't call F me cuz I got enough trouble clearing my own throat all right but now think about it my point is to try to get you to think about yourself let's don't even talk about Salvation let's don't even talk about uh you know anything like that that can be dealt with we'll take that up in the next message or so let's just talk about you cuz I was just thinking about something you know what is man what is man that God would want to fellowship with us do we smell different do we look different why would he want to fellowship with us because he created us in that image that's right that likeness of himself and in doing that then he can come down and fellowship we'll get down to it later where he comes on down into human flesh in the Lord Jesus Christ but I'm trying to bring down something you we may be surprising this afternoon when we pick up and try to run through the Bible a little bit with with doing it but I'm trying to just bring a few points here to us because I asked a person one time I said uh what does your pastor preach about the soul and what a soul really is and she told me she said I don't I've never heard him preach on it well I thought well surely somewhere down the line I don't have a backlog of sermons rolled up to where that I can just pick one to preach surely somewhere down the line they ought have been talking about something of what is a s now you can get Webster's definition you can get the things and try to pick up you know to what what it is and what you're doing and all but man is a triun being that's right just like God is a triun being he's not a trinity he's a triun being Father Son and Holy Ghost one true and living God simple terminology right Father Son and Holy Ghost making one God all right see then when he made man he made us as a Body Spirit and soul to where he can communicate with us body we can communicate with with one another through our bodies we talk we you know you hear taste you see taste feel smell hear all of your your senses all right then you go into the spiritual part of man which is memory reason conscious affections love desires etc etc dealing with the spiritual part of man and and we can look at those things and you can love God that that's the secret of the end times that people don't understand seemingly if you can actually love God and still be lost why wouldn't you want to love God I mean look at us why wouldn't you want to love God that's now a lot of you are not old enough to realize anything that that that I can talk about but you think about that that in 71 years I went from 7 years old pling a mule out in the field digging in dirt all right trying to make a living we was there was nine of us and we had to all work all right but then you go from that to where in the old houses we lived in was barns today you could see through the floor you could see through the walls you could see through this the 10 and we remember when we'd be in the night and it start raining with if somebody had to jump up and get all the pots and pans and set them all over the house lot of you are not old enough to even think about those things but my point is look what man has been able to do in just the 70 years that I've been alive we went from and that was you know coming on up to the 40s and uh but man in 100 years was set that away has went from a horse and buggy to putting an astronaut into outer space you that's right that's right why because he has the ability some way to think things out to reason things out to you know pull from his inner part of him as I said a while ago that people can actually Bend metal by just concentrating upon it can actually do things that are looking almost impossible but they can do it because they're human beings and being a human being we are something very special then right that soul that is within you is so valuable until God one day came down and gave his own life to be able to save you now that's how valuable a man is he didn't come down to save the animal right come on there's under the curse they're out there and they will be one day delivered from all these things we understand the scripture but yet God T so much of man till he come down and give his own self to where he could save that person amen he loves mankind where do you think we get all of these thoughts from the prophet of God one day said it like this he said science has broken into God's laboratory that's a good way to say it you know science has actually broken into God's laboratory look at it look what they can do right taking my hand there enough Adams to blow 10 million worlds away and you can't see it where did he get those things from what caused him to be able to bring these things to pass was because that he's a child of God now get what I'm saying about this just because I say that every person in the world is a child of God I'm not talking about every person in the world saved now don't don't get that tired of what I'm talking about right no no that's not it you got to accept your salvation you got to do that yourself right I'm just saying the way God made us and he's our creator he he is our Our God he's our father in the basis of creation right he created us for a special purpose to Fellowship he didn't want to fellowship with just the angels He had them he didn't want to just fellowship with the animals he had them he wanted something more that would be like his image and things I encourage you children to use your mental faculties always have I always wanted the kids I demanded the kids at least get a high school education what they done after then was between them they they had to take care of those things but I I I demanded them to get a high school education because I I didn't have the opportunity to get one and and doing that you know I I I quit in the ninth grade started a little bit in the 10th grade and uh I I I never had an opportunity to get an education I always really wanted to go back and and and and it wouldn't bother me today I'd love to to be able to just go to college but I know it flunk because every time that they open their mouth it'd be like Anna was when she was trying to to go and and you know they demanded that she write down their answers and I said you write down their answers and if you want to write yours down beside of it if they question you about it we'll go to court and see what they say you know cuz you just put down their answers and Let It Go CU it's the only way you going to get an education but yet see children go to school and learn right in this society that we live in you don't want to be illiterate cuz that's what I'm get literacy because I don't have the the education you don't want to be that go to school and learn you might be an Einstein if there's a world tomorrow you know what time because that's way it works use that brain you've got you know learn think things out I watch little Abby she's 4 years old and she'll learn to do things well that's wonderful encourage your children to do that she started out and they and we got tickles out we was eating the other day and she looked up and she was pointing to these things on the wall what it is they got these uh movie stars up on the wall but they got a big head and a little bitty body well you know she was just pointing at it and talking about it but see when she draws that's the way she draws she'll draw a big head eyes nose ears hair and everything you know and then she'll have a little be body because you know that's just they're thinking and they're doing but I was watching her and the other day you know what she looked around and she had draw and she'll say and she'll tell me this is Poppy and she'll draw me with just a little bit High she draw her mother and she had a whole lot of high you know all right and she draw one of me and you know what she put she draw glasses she said poppy that's when you're reading the Bible study because encourage them though to do those things because you're you're working that inward part of you and and it's the soul of that individual there's no limit to what it is that's why the Bible said that he had to put them out in the in geneses remember because there was nothing with Holden from man right the imagination of man's heart is continually evil but yet look what he's done with all of his evil I don't want you to think now what is a soul what are we now in a sense an animal has a c feel smelling here right all right in a sense he has a form of memory reason cons ience affections Etc they love their little babies they they do and and things but yet they're they're you know they are are are limited all right but they don't have the soul to be able to reason anything out in the highest form because that Soul that's within you God made you that way you know why now we've covered this point but listen he made made you that way or made all of us that way to be able to fellowship with us but he made us that way knowing that one day he would come and bring Salvation you remember we was up in heaven stayed up there a long time in our studies and now we've dropped down to earth all right so God made man in the garden and even though mankind fail he still is using that that he made him and that will be what he contacts that person with he was back there in the Old Testament that's why I said it give it about David David said my soul thirst after that there was something about him the Bible said you know sacrifice and offerings I would us not but an honest and a contrite heart is what God looks at amen because that's where he's dealing with us and you can look back there and see that he was dealing with those people but there was just no way to bring in to Salvation because the animal was made a sacrifice all right but yet there was no life in the animal that could come back upon the human how could that the life of a a lamb come back on a human being it it won't work but it all spoke of a time when the Lamb of God would come upon the Earth right and give his own life to be able to to bring us to the place that we could search after that God he made you with a desire you go around the world it didn't matter where you go whether you go to a place in in Africa back in where that they they've never even seen or heard of the name of Jesus or or live in a little old Tri of their own that maybe he never hardly seen anything else and yet they're worshiping right they make all kind of images they make all kind of little idols and they believe not that that Idol that they've made is there God come on they know it's a stick or something they made but they believe that that's in the image of their God or likeness or thoughts of it right you know because their mind is upon their creator the old Indian he worshiped you see God could deal with those people who was it gono or coach Chief one of two I believe it was jono even saw Visions right that's why they had trouble trying to Capt him a lot of times God could speak to those people right because that they were human beings it's not that you got to be saved for God can speak to you you better get that out of your mind because you remember there was a time you was lost and God had to speak to you right but see there's something that he wanted to communicate he wanted to communicate with a being right cuz he's a being we've been through that I don't believe God is like the wind just blowing to and fro just you know no no cuz if he did you would never have to seek salvation it just blow inside of you and then blow back out you wouldn't have to seek it right see God is a being he's real amen and being a real God he wanted something to where he could Fellowship right and even in our fallen estate he can fellowship with us don't you remember when you when you was a kid or something and God dealing with you I've told you my experiences if I have followed what was dealing with me when I was a child i' never went and done wrong cuz that's a soul the soul of an individual is really to put it down in in in terms like this to help us it's really a moral obligation to do good right why because you were created to be good that's right you wasn't created to to be wrong you were created to be good right you wasn't created to lie you were created to tell the truth to prove that they can put a machine on you and tell whether you're lying or not right right a lot of teor and then you tell whether you're lying or not why because you wasn't made to lie you wasn't made for that purpose right you was made for the purpose to be able to where God could contact you amen now as I said it I keep saying it the animals he could fellowship with them that was fine he could talk to them you know and understand their coings and their their doings and and all like that he could fellowship with them but that wasn't what he wanted he wanted somebody that would be like him so he created Adam created him perfect everything was beautiful but when man fell from that estate it didn't just annihilate everything God didn't say well but y'all done it now going on just liveing I'm going back up in heaven step there no he come right down and he's been down here ever since then trying to help us trying to fellowship with us why because of the Soul that's within you right something that makes you different than an animal you just think about how God created you and you know that he didn't created all of us to be the same well sizewise we're different you know we're different male female Etc but yet he made all of us with a desire that's right come on now no matter where you would go in the world today you would find people that are not Christians as we call it but they have a desire they have aone David back there where he was at there was no Holy Ghost to get within David to be able to give him the new birth as we'd call it but mankind had a long in within him to find God what made David so different than anybody else what made it to the basis that I've tried to preach it to you before that this person over here go out and kill somebody and the law says kill him David had a man killed took his wife and done all kind of dirty garbage cans and yet he didn't die why you said he's a king no that doesn't make no difference it didn't matter where it's King a priest you know remember one of the Kings there one time that that decided he was going to go in and he was going to make stop that sacrifices he had seen them do it and he decided Well I'm King I can do what I want to They begged him not to he went in he was struck with what with Leprosy I think and had that the rest of his life why because it wasn't his office it wasn't his calling he wasn't supposed to be doing that but you see what about the priest now he could go in what was the difference in David the said the Bible says you know sacrifice God finally got fed up with all that sacrifice it just stink in his nostrils he said but he said an honest and a contrite heart what did David have coming from the bed of B Sheba in adultery that we were talking about and yet he cries out return unto me the joy of thy salvation that's right he knew he didn't have any cuz he done goofed up right right but he said return unto me the joy of thy salvation an honest and a contrite heart what is that now David could in one split cut a man's stroke it's not talking about that right when he was fighting for doings he was fighting to Bar the line the giant I mean he he was ready to to to kill but down inside of him was something that God could look at and say and the Bible actually calls David a man after God's Own Heart that's right it actually call in the apple of God's eye right now was he the apple of God's eye when he was in the bed of adultery with a bash Sheba no no no no that that's don't go carnal but yet he was repentant right he was repentant he repented of what he was doing and God would hear him amen you remember Nathan when he went into to David and David he went through the long story with David you know about the sheep and the different things and the one had the one little one and and David himself said bring that man here in other words I'll kill him that's what he said David you're the man right David knew right then it meant death and had it not been for Nathan the prophet it would have been right Nathan said but God has told me to come and tell you you won't die but the child will die and this will be with you the rest of your days and you will not even be allowed to build me a house that's right you can get everything ready and he did he got it ready for Solomon but remember Solomon built a house that's right see he was put under the curse because of the things he done but yet he was so in to the point that that Soul cried out see that's what God looks at amen amen the soul of the individual that's right body wise we're all human beings that's right black white yellow green whates it make any difference ain't no difference black man give me a blood transfusion you'd be tickled to death get one if you needed it you might sit back and be a a whatever those words are racist or whatever I never do get them right but you might sit back and say I hate them black people but you sure don't question them when you go down to the hospital and you go in and they going to give you some blood well is that a black guy to give the blood I don't want it well that's the only part we got that's right right oh go ahead and get to right things changes when you get in trouble you soldiers that was out there and doing you know you might have been one thing over here but when you in the Foxhole getting shot at you better believe it didn't matter what the color the guy was on the other side of you that's right but get my point of what I'm trying to say a soul of a man made to want to serve God made for a longing and in in there to serve God we answer it with the world right had I known what I know now I would have never went into the world as I did amen that's right amen is that the way you are if we could change things it'd be a lot different wouldn't it you see we over Road you know we went over we we we went across the boundaries that God was trying to tell us not to do that if he could tell a hot and toot in Africa to be good and then your Prophet go over there and he said said I went into those tribes and things and he said not find one case of venial disease we think that's where the dirty things was at and all the dirty things is here in the what we call civilization right why because they were pure and made rip had to take a mergency test before they could get married and if they failed it they killed them and the man also what would happen today which did you see God made us to long after him to desire him and even in our fallen the state we still have that desire we still want to serve him cuz we're not a dog or a cat we're a human mortal that is made to long after God made to desire something to work you know you know yourself the first drink you took you was told not to take it something inside of you said don't do that that's the soul right that's the moral obligation of the inside of you that told you don't do it right had you listened to that had we paid attention to those things we wouldn't have went out and done like we' done right that's right why because he was trying to deal with us but yet being like David we could go out and have a man's wife have a man killed to get his wife to cover up our adulterous act he go out and just Liv in garbage cans in the world of sin right but thank God God never left us he don't leave man he's still right there with you that's right you you can preach salvation any way you want to I preach it to what I believe the prophet of God said every man was born with that special gift what to want to serve God right no matter who we are right you want to serve God yeah we turned to the world of sin and done those things and went after it why because we are able to make decisions had we been animals we would have not had that ability that's right nothing immoral in the animal kingdom only for reproduction right that's right because that's what it is but in the human realm we're made to word that see now immorality or what you want to say it is rampant across the world until it is getting into Africa and places that you'd say that started out real pure and then you find out that's where a lot of these diseases does come from why because the white man went there the Indian was doing wonderful here in America didn't have no diseases didn't have no problems we came over here and gave him all kind of things and gave him moonshine gave him you know give him liquor made him crazy and we took his land away from him cuz see that's what we can think we can reason out we can reason out that's what we do we reason out and we you know we say well you know here we are we just and we say we've got to lay this out we got to make a city we got to make a a rulings out of these things until we rued ourselves to death then that's from the soul of man cuz he has that ability to think things out right but what if we took that and turned it to God what if we take it today and turn it to God Amen talking about the soul of man yes what would we be if we just listen to that inward part amen God is right there always handy he's never away that's right that's right you can go through the Genesis sure and you can get up and and preach about how that it was made the word that the man was to to have to work for a living you know in the sweat of his brow and the woman was to be under her husband subjected to him and all that's good and well right but none of that converts the soul that's right just don't turn down when God's dealing with that soul right cuz the Bible said he won't always drive with man that's right he gave man 120 years in the days of Noah right right but that was it he's promised us so much time on Earth but that's it right right what about that Soul what about that longing within your heart and that desire have you quenched it with something else have you let the world and everything else take away from you the the desire to want to serve God cuz remember you're not going out into sin until you turn down God's word first right that's what I've started off with and that's where we're still at that's what happened with Eve in the garden right she first took God's I mean to Satan's words through the Beast the snake as you want to call it made of Beast she took it in her head then it went down into her being in her spirit realm and she began to reason and things and he began to tell her wasn't this what she was made for and she listened yes kids when that thing starts telling you thing just remember somebody else is trying to talk to you too right amen don't listen to that thing oh he'll show you how beautiful everything is he'll show you how beautiful life is and what all of this stuff is and how it's wonderful he don't show you the garbage can you wind up being in that's right don't show you how you wind up giving yourself to other people in your bodies and things like that and I'm show you how you begin to drink and do dope and right oh it looks good yes but then go down sometimes and look in the garbage canins of the world and see what it's done to people like that yep sure you feel good maybe with you dope I never done nothing like that never drink never done any of thank God for it I wouldn't saved either I was lost I just didn't care nothing about it mainly I couldn't afford it you'll be blunt we were so poor I couldn't afford me and my wife when I got married and 1958 I made $42 a week paying rent light bill couldn't afford a phone old clunker car that my dad-in-law took care of him kep it running couldn't afford to do the things a lot of you wound up with money to be able to do but the money you wound up with wound up being a curse cuz you wound up going to the world with it right don't do it amen listen to that inward part of you that's the soul amen soul of an individual is so wonderful until that's the part god deals with that's right he has to deal through your brain to get to you yes he has to deal through your memory reason conscious affs cuz that's part of you cuz you're a tri being but he's really trying to speak to that Soul right see he tried back there to get within the man but there was no way to do it David could long after God but yet he could right around and walk after the things of the world cuz there was no way that animal life could come back and free the man it could only cover the person right to keep them from being destroyed but a soul look at a little kid you look at these little children I love to watch them I like to watch them grow I like to watch them be able to do things to read to do i' like to watch that because I watch them as they're doing and do it on your own you know that you're one of your great presidents Abraham Lincoln he had to teach himself to read I think went the Bible wouldn't it but he had to teach himself to read wind up being president of the United States but see if he stayed where he wouldn't been able to read he wouldn't be president right CU it wouldn't had even though everybody else couldn't read they still want the president could read but just think about these things even in your Fallen estate let's just read a few quotes just to get the point where you'll see what the prophet had to say about it and then we'll we'll close on go ahead brother look what the prophet had to say e22 1956 527 and Cates barnea now we can't create Timber but we can take Timber after God has created it and make a house out of it because we're offsprings of God think about it Sons and Daughters of God no matter how Fallen we are still we have to recognize that we are Sons and Daughters of God in our fallen estate we're still Sons and Daughters of God a't that something right no matter what we are we're still the children of God Amen even in a fallen estate going down to the next let's just read through three of these and we quit Divine love Eve 17 1956 82 six look what he said now we want to talk of facts now the reason that is is because of the atmosphere that the individual himself or herself creates now listen because you're an you're a miniature Creator right now all I've been talking about now because your sons and Daughters of God no matter how far you sto in sin you're still Sons and Daughters of God because you're fallen degenerated in your soul and mind but God is your creator and in your Fallen estate you are lost undone creature of God dominated by the devil that's right but still your sons and daughters of God now what's he talking about by creation right he don't give us salvation because we are human beings the dogs and cats ought to get it first you agree y That's Right plain language but they already get it before we do because they're not like us that's right but even in our fallen estate God still wants to deal with us but under the next you'll see where we that's getting to E15 Fellowship 1960 now God wanted fellowship and if we no matter if men today is a fallen Son of God there's some parts of God still with that man in his Fallen State some parts you're not talking about salvation you're talking about a desire a longing to serve God you take a man today that can split an atom or molecule or whatever you want to to call it you can drive a jet plane around the world in a few hours you see that he is something in him is a fallen creation now he cannot create anything but he can pervert what has been created into something to better himself and that shows that man never come from animal life because animal life continually builds the same Habit habitations to live in but man makes him a better house a better way of living better clothes and better transportation now all that shows that there's something behind even in Fallen State he still there I always say to you how many wants to drive home today in a a model oh you'd like to have it where you could sell it but what if we all that's all we had I don't want to go back to that we used to push him a lot all right how many would like to go back to living in the homes we used to live in but nobody could sneak up on you because you could see them coming how many would like to go back to you know old food's good but still how many wants to go back to the old ear corn I don't maybe I'm CL ized to the world so much until I sure do love this tender sweet corn man that old corn we used to get it was about two days too old and you you had problems chewing but you see because of a soul we're able to better ourselves that's right now we will never be able to better ourselves into salvation don't never get get that idea because the smarter we get the Dumber we become the smarter we get the further away from God we try to determine to be well brother Dale you read some quotes and you got a whole lot more there talking about that we're Sons and Daughters of God right but that's by natural creation right that's not eternal life right that is a person that can live upon this Earth and even love God and enjoy life there are good people in this world this is not a bad world they're good people yes there's people out there that would help you do things and do for you they're good people yes sir but that don't give salvation that's right amen see salvation can only come through Jesus Christ and that meant that he had to come into this world as a mortal human being in the bases of a body that's right right a body thou H has prepared Hebrews 10:5 a body thou has prepar God stepped into that body there when the baby was born and become Emmanuel God With Us but he was born for a purpose and that purpose was to die amen that he might release that life yes cuz the life it didn't matter how many times they died it didn't make any difference how many animals you sacrifice right you couldn't come back see because man having a soul or being a soul is a better way of saying it not having one being a soul of a being what you are and no matter what you are there's still a desire down within there to want to serve God that's just don't turn it away God had to give his own life to be able to come and live in you and I yes he didn't take your soul out and destroy it he just worked on the nature of it cuz the nature of your soul or our souls were perverted little kids what happened to that Soul born in this domain this world you don't have to teach a kid the lie you just let him get about 2 years old and gets cookie on his face and cookie in his hand and you ask him to eating a cooking he said mm you don't have to teach him he just born in this domain right but yet God is still dealing with that little soul that little soul if it would listen would grow up to be right and turn out to search after God right because that's what God made us for amen he made the soul of man to where that we could accept him into our soul body to body he's my brother right right Jesus Christ is my brother that's why the Bible say he's not ashamed to call him Brethren he's my brother brother to brother he's human he was a mortal body but inside of there was a soul and a spirit that was almighty God he can come and deal with us in our spirit realm and and we begin to straighten up and want to do right and that's good that's right soul to soul is where the life of God comes to live in you that's what we call the New Birth you know getting saved salvation coming and living inside of us to give us his life cuz that was his purpose right the purpose for creating man come on creating him like he did above the animals giving him a soul was for the fact that he knew one day he'd come and live in that person and that would be his be his ultimate desire then would be we would be then the children of God by new birth right Paul call New Creation new creature old things are passed away the Bible says and see we become a Christian by accepting Jesus Christ letting him come into our soul and live and give us eternal life soul of man is the most wonderful thing cuz that's what God created as far to where he' eventually be able to come and live in us I hope that goes home with you and you think about it you were made for that reason for God to come down and impart his own life right that would make us the children of God in a higher state her way on higher than to think of a natural creation and that would make his desire to be complete where he can come and live in man he wants to give his life away that's what I've always said eternal life the one thing that you want to give away you so brother Dale you're crazy to say you want to give away eternal life I know I can't it's just the way I saying it I sure wish I could you ever ever really got that honest and sincere enough to think that you would give away the eternal life you have no no well then you just don't have it that's right I just just put it that way just be blunt you don't have what I'm talking about cuz once you get it you want to give it away that's the only reason I preach I preach trying to give away what God gives me that's right that's the only reason I preach sure ain't for money sure ain't for popularity sure ain't for all that is to want to give away what God give me think on these things come on brother think on these things what is man excuse me for the wording cuz I don't have no education but a product or whatever you want to call it of being created higher than all the animals as I've said probably 10 times but made where God could come and live in us and give us eternal life amen a wonderful part of you as a soul you be Brother D I love God you can do that with your spirit CU that's where you love with your spirit but down inside of there there a soul as David said my soul thirs that the oh God David said Thy word I have hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee he had a longing a great desire but there was no way to answer that but not so today you now the answer right all he wants is you that's right amen well I'd have to quit this and I'd have to quit that you don't have to quit nothing right you don't have to quit nothing is come to Jesus and find Salvation go ahead brother let's stand again 51 in spiral 51 51 anybody have a name down at the cross where
