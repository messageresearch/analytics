========================================

all right God bless you say so it's good to be in the house of the Lord I'm expecting this morning all right I think we got it figured out this time y'all didn't have to applaud that but I appreciate it let's ask the Lord to bless the reading of the word Lord Jesus we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning around your word and we just come with expectation Lord that whatever happens needs we have Lord that you'll minister to us we ask the Lord It's Your Blessing as we study through your the book of Hebrews this morning and bless brother Wade as he's studying back there Lord granted Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus amen so Hebrews chapter 6 we've been studying through um uh uh well Keepers chapter six which Paul's really getting into the topic of anointed ones so we just kind of finished that up and and dive into that a little bit more this morning and so let's read starting at verse 4 it says for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift so he's talking about people that have to have tasted of the Heavenly gift um that uh you know experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh on their spirit and their work you know in church and and have have have you know you know recognized things like there's uh there's a message for the age and and uh and we're partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again under repentance seeing They Crucified themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame and so crucifying crucifying the Son of God is when you your your uh you're you're not just leaving but you're turning around and lashing back at it you reject you're rejecting the word and of course that's what what happened when they crucified Jesus to begin with was they they crucified and they put them on the cross because they rejected what he stood for they rejected his word they didn't believe that he was who said he was and they didn't believe the message that he was bringing for the earth now here's the here's kind of the Clincher and talking about rain for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off on it that the rain comes and and falls on the Earth and the Earth just soaks it up and in the earth you've got a lot of different a lot of different seeds coming up you got good and bad and thorns and Briars and and wheat and everything coming up and they're all drinking of that rain for the Earth was drinking in the rain that cometh off on it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but so you'd see what brother Brown will get to as uh as as we started this out and what Paul's trying to trying to point out is just because you come to church and you get a blessing doesn't mean it doesn't necessarily mean that that down on the inside that Soul has received the word but that which Barrett thorns and Briars is rejected so you can you can you can see the evidence of what uh an individual is or what a plan is by the fruit that is bearing because you know brother Randall in one place he said your fruit is your Doctrine your fruit it grows up and it manifests itself it comes out and it manifests the doctrine is actually alive now and so you can see you can taste the fruit of another person's believer's life so when that when you're when you're bearing thorns and Briars instead of love and joy and peace and long suffering and all those kind of things and then thorns and Briars is what's rejected and is nine to cursing who's in this to be burned so you know last time we talked about to you you've got to um Paul talking about it's impossible for those who are once enlightened and and one way of looking at that isn't as the light is going to go the light travels from age to age and you've got to keep Pace with it and so the Martin the the people that follow Martin Luther they they eventually uh along along they denominated and they cabbage down and they said well now we've got it and they failed to move along with the light as it progressed that's that's really what a denomination is is when you're cabbage down you say oh we got it we we we we got the understanding and and failed to see that that God is continuing to move on and like Paul's talking as he as he just starts talking in the beginning of Hebrews chapter six he's trying to God is trying to move us to Perfection he's trying to move the whole church to Perfection all down through the seven Church ages and some the light is moving on to bring us to a place where we can we we're one with Christ to perfection so you got to keep Pace with it and and you know if you don't keep Pace with it then uh that you the all those types of you you can't you can't live by a Mana that's been stored up and you you've gotta you gotta stay with a present tense reality a present tense message John Wesley come along and he preached uh corresponding to first Thessalonians 5 23 the very God of Peace sanctify you holy that God was able to take a Believer and sanctify him and make them live a holy life and make them get rid of all the things in the world and start start uh like where Martin Luther would be smoking a pipe and and so forth and sitting in the pub talking about the gospel but yet John Wesley come along and he began to believe in a in a Sanctified holy life I see it's building up we don't we don't get away from those things those foundational precepts that we're living God wants us to live a holy life a set apart life and then Azusa Street moving on up to the restoration of the gifts so the gospel is like it's it's like the the spirit is like a light that illuminates the word and makes it live and so brother Adam said for it is impossible when he when he was explaining this scripture for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and didn't move on with the word as it come to pass they are dead gone and the thorns and thistles which is nigh unto rejection whose end is to be burned so you see what happens when you don't keep Pace with the word what happens is they cabbage down and they they said well this is it and they and they failed and they came to up there came to a place where where God said I I'm I'm going on I'm I'm leaving you're not keeping Pace with me so that whole question that keeps coming up or can you be born again in a denomination and things you know you know let me maybe just kind of think about there was a time where FF Bosworth if it I don't know if he ever came to the realization that brother Brown was a was a Believer but I believe he was born again and brother Brown would sit under him and and or or listen to listen to the things he said he was a great influence to him but yet I believe he was a a overlap times you got the overlaps where somebody like like Billy Graham or Roberts really could that that God would be moving in their life and they had a part to play and there's times of overlap but you keep you've got to keep moving on because sooner or later the God is going to leave you behind and uh so you you got to keep moving on that's the that's the main thing and this morning in church age brother round and said now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives to receive the word for the age so now now if you really want to get get down like when John Wesley began to priest they couldn't they couldn't in that age say well we're just going to stay with Martin Luther's understanding or when the baptism of the Holy Ghost was restored on on Azusa Street it would be it would be dangerous to to try to stay uh back to keep keep back with the Methodist understanding so like in brother in Revelation chapter 3 22 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and last time we were talking about if you want to know what God's saying you've got to get under the message of your day of your age that's you that's the only way that you're going to hear what the spirit wants to wants for you to understand so again what you get back what what's what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost and in each age there was a group of people that were called out that listened to the word of their Porter that open up the door a way of escape and they heard that message and they said under that message and were subject to it as the word went out and you receive it and you bear fruit for that age so that's really that's really the evidence so so if you if you taste of the of the good things and you and you fall away and you don't keep going on with the word and you or you know that the exactly so that Paul's saying have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the God Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame so we've got all these examples in the Old Testament and the New Testament of those that didn't keep Pace with the word that didn't go on like like Cain Cain did not get under subjection to the word of his day which was Abel's message that we need to we need a lamb we it's blood it was there's a the problem was life the problem from the beginning was life and there's got to be something to pay to pay the the price for us and and so he failed to get under subjection to the word and Nathan and coral following Moses they failed to realize that God wanted them to go into the promised land and that Moses was the one to take them so they they failed to get into subjection to the word of the day and Balaam going around acting like a uh he he was acting like a Believer a religious hypocrite and and trying to get everybody together and say we're all one that was his message went out that the 10 line spies that hung around and failed to go into the promised land you see the example of all these they they they were they were in church will say that they were going along with the other believers but yet they rejected the word so what's it come down to word rejecters and in the New Testament we've got Caiaphas prophesying prophesying while they were on the hanging Jesus on the cross but yet he they he was over them that crucified Jesus and Judas that hung around until the very last hung around with Jesus going along carrying the money the money with for all the disciples and casting out devils and and uh and preaching the gospel and and doing all those kind of things you know that's kind of a it's a scary topic it should it should be something to you know make us examine ourselves and make us make us uh uh examine Our Lives so look at what brother Brown said and I think this was the church age book he said no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting and Gifts is upon them but like Balaam they have all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain so instead of interest and interest in the word and the only one's going to be interested more in money and and and and gifts and programs and things like that again see that the word is a central thing the word is what makes the difference yet they preached salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong Spirit motivating them you see how the seed the the word that's planted actually is what will it allow it it uh makes a way for the spirit to become active in your life so if the wrong seed is planted then the wrong spirit will be motivating you but if the rice seed is planted then the rice spirit will be motivating you that's that's actually you know sometimes you'll think well I wonder I wonder if their spirit is with us well if the word is with us if you've got the right understanding the right attitude toward the word then the spirit will be with you see if you ever wanted you feeling like maybe you feel get to feeling down or something well do like David did when they they ran and kidnapped his wives and kidnapped everything and he's he said bring me the ephot he turned back to the to the word for that day the word is the main thing religious oh my they outshined the elect and effort and Zeal but it is a layout of sea and not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them you see how the evidence of success in the gospel is not a lot of people or a lot of big programs or a lot of money success in the gospel is are you overcoming it doesn't matter if you have a lot of people around you or a lot of money or or you're a big successful preacher success in the gospel is is the gospel having an effect in your life are you overcoming because if you're overcoming and you're preaching to a a a a a stream and eating soda crackers or whatever that's that's all that matters all that matters is that you have given yourself to God and he's using you it doesn't matter there's a lot of impersonations but we want the genuine he said they preached the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though in power and signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all this false spirit that in the last day is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word and whenever it is caught and being anti-word it falls back on the one argument we have already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God now now that doesn't mean so you read this something maybe maybe a trap we fall into sometimes is you know Jesus said don't uproot don't uproot people wait till they grow up and harvest and then God will take care of it but we have a tendency sometimes to go grabbing people and just pulling them pluck them out of the earth and tossing them over but you just wait and things will things will things will manifest in time and uh you know he said they'll say we get results don't we well that don't mean results is bad I want to see results in my life but again it comes down to the differentiator is the word look at the word just because somebody's saying that we get results and preaching some false Doctrine now that's that's where you you gotta you raise your eyebrows and and and and uh maybe take a step back but the word will bring results and the main thing is the word the word is the seed and the seed will bring the right Spirit the rice seed will bring the right Spirit and the rice seed will bring the right kind of results so brother Ram said now this is the quote so many people have stumbled over the years and this is what Paul's getting at now we're not getting away from what Paul's talking about it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost so brother Adam said in the message leadership he said many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so I hope that doesn't choke anybody this morning but that's a that's a big that's a big statement and you can have the baptism only ghost every hour in your life so so there we can see there's a difference between the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the new birth right the baptism of the Holy Ghost has got to have something to Quicken but you've got the seed planted then the baptism of the Holy Ghost will give you a birth when the rain falls it's got to have some seed and if there's wrong seed planting then it's not going to be able to Quicken the way that God wants it to but if you've got the right seed plant if you've got a wheat seed planted when the rain falls the batch is the Holy Ghost it's going to bring up that rice seed and it's going to manifest it's going to Quicken a real genuine life so what's the most important thing the most important thing is the word if you get the word sewn down and you hold on to that word and maybe there's questions and things but you hang on to that word at the baptism Holy Ghost we'll Quicken it amen amen absolutely it'll make it real I mean now see there's so many there's so many uh examples in scripture of false now brother around or the Bible says in chapter Mark chapter 3 that he ordained 12 that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and they have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out Devils now there you got Jesus moving around with our Judas with the with the 12 and and he's a devil to begin with and yet he's going around with a baptism of holy ghost or the the spirit moving in his life the spirit on us on giving that has given him power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils and he's going around preaching the gospel but yet false down on the inside and the Bible says in Matthew 24 for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that effort were possible they shall deceive the very elect but brother Branham in the message and only one said that the very elect won't be deceived because they will be the word and if you are the word how can you be deceived because you know what you're looking for you know the the differentiator the thing that makes the difference is the word foreign in Matthew Chapter 5 he said you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you now now look what Jesus is getting to the rain falls on the just unjust but before he gets to that he lays out this pattern I know there's going to be he's saying I know there's going to be fakers I know there's going to be uh wolves and sheep's clothing but listen you got to love everybody you can't just go around yanking people up and toss them into fire and say well you know throwing people out be careful with throwing people out but he said boss I love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you there's an example of a real believer when you can when you can show love to somebody that disagrees with your doctrine that don't that don't like you very much and that that that shuns the way that you believe or the way that you think he said that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth the rain on the just and on the unjust so there you've got another example of rain falling on all different kinds of seeds falling on the earth the baptism of the Holy ghosts fallen on people they have all have no seed planted fall seed planted the genuine seed planted and it's going to bring up what's been planted the rain falls on the just and the unjust now brother Brown we we talked about this story maybe I'll maybe I'll go through this fast quickly but I think I think we're all familiar with the story of that he talked about in anointing ones of the of the two Believers in that in that Pentecostal meeting that and one was not living right and one was genuine and he said here were two men one of which was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts and brother and God showed him in Hebrews chapter 6 the chapter that we're studying he gave him the example of that situation where he was real perplexed how can how can this one be speaking in tongues in this genuine Holy Ghost be moving in his life but yet he's he's I know by desarma that he's not living he's living with a a woman that's not his wife or uh I forget the specifics of the situation but she he was not living right so he looked to Hebrews 6 and he saw that the sower went forth to sow and he sowed the genuine seed and then another sower went behind him and sowed another the fake the the the the tares and the after a while the tares came up and the wheat and tears grew together and they partooked the same nourishment out of the same soil and they drank in the same sun and rain isn't that interesting that both kind of seeds can partake can get a benefit out of the baptism the Holy Ghost but one can be genuine and one can be false and in the Bible we've got The Parables that uh that that Jesus told of a different kind of something's moving in my backyard I keep getting notifications I keep getting uh you know excuse me Jesus told that that Parable in Matthew Chapter 13 of the of the of the of the of the sower that so different kinds of sow the seed and the seed uh now the way brother Brown explained it he'd say some some of it fell by the wayside and he said like water on a duck's back it just run right off a bird will carried away and it's just like water on a duck's back but some felt some of the seed fell on Rocky ground Stony ground it just had a little dust that blowed up there and sprung up but it didn't have no roots no place to put his roots and he said now I'm going to make illustrations here and I hope I don't hurt no feelings see that was the Catholic Church who thought they were a rock he said they thought they were they was built on a rock that's what they said he said I'll agree with them I'm not sure we'll agree with them no Earth under it at all no Earth on it to grow from why I couldn't produce it and then some fell on the protestant's ground but after a while the great wisdom of the big denomination choked it out you see how you got to be careful with with cabbaging down on a little bit of understanding that we got when you say well I got it and put a period behind it and won't move on then how's the seed going to come up it just gets choked out but if we'll have a real now see the real good ground let's look at listen and see what brought around how he explained this he said some fail and the valley of persecution oh man when the ground is all tilled up when people people are treating you wrong and you just get all broken down and you got to get along with God and the ground's all tilled up and you get to you've got a broken and a contrite heart and you're ready for to receive that word you get to a place of desperation and you're like God I I've been sitting around maybe in the church for a long time but something's got to give I need something that's real something that's genuine and he said now in the valley is where you find the water the best soil when you take somebody has been beat down till he's got all the theology beat out of him laughed out of him made fun of him where he's been through the Mills and grounded all out of him until the metal has been ready to work you'll find out there is some moisture around there that's right into the valley that fella has been pitched over into the valley kicked out of his organization he's down in the dumps they call it not the dumps but the valley we're taught down in the valley you know that's where the Lily grows you know that's right in the valley some fell in the valley of persecutions hard trial some of them seed fell in their Valley of persecutions hard trials he called everything like the Lily was called bl's above made fun of and that in that good ground that good ground of seed being sown and a and a receptive heart is where it'll come up where Jesus said he that received good received into the good ground is he that heareth the word somebody that's ready to receive it and understandeth it so you see what what really gives you rest is when you understand the word what really gives you confidence is when you understand it you can go along and you don't you maybe you come to church and you don't understand what's being preached but then one day it the spirit just comes and just quickens it because you've been hanging on to it and you've held it and you understand so there's your evidence he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100 fold some 60 some 30. all down through the church ages different groups of Believers have brought forth different different amounts but I believe in this church age you're going to bring you're going to bring forth a Bountiful Harvest you're going to bring forth an understanding of the son of man you're going to bring forth he that he Hearth the word and understand if this Revelation you're gonna it's time to bring forth a a great harvest that can be harvested in a rapture so Paul's saying in Hebrews chapter 6 and I've tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance and the musicians can go ahead and come forward seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord so enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and what's his will his will is his word I my wife and I were talking about somebody we know that had been praying that they got in a real bad spot and they were saying don't pray don't pray that I be healed but pray for the will of God but what is the will of God God wants you to be healed see that's something that you can rest in when when you have understanding that God wants you to be healed then it banishes all the questions and you're wondering does God what does God want me to be happy yes God wants you to be happy he wants you to have peace he wants you to be healed he wants you to be well so we'll leave you on that that's all God bless you foreign
