[35:32] or something you eat or except the word
[35:34] of God.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; The word of God is the only thing that's
[35:36] going to get us out of here. And that's
[35:38] what the the souls in the sixth
[35:40] dimension,
[35:42] [clears throat] that's where the word
[35:43] people go.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; But them word people over there are not
[35:48] in their right to be conditioned.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; They are longing. Now, that's kind of
[35:52] strange. We're longing to get out of
[35:55] here. They're longing to come back here
[35:58] &gt;&gt; cuz they're coming back here though to
[35:59] complete they without us shall not be
[36:02] made perfect.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Then we'll come down here connect with
[36:05] the with all of us be perfect together.
[36:07] And then we're going to get out of here.
[36:09] Then we're going to let we're going to
[36:10] let the Lord do what he's going to do
[36:12] and and uh just pray to God you're not
[36:15] here after the rapture takes place
[36:19] [clears throat] cuz all these little
[36:20] things that we see today and earthquakes
[36:22] and tsunamis and um hurricanes dropping
[36:26] a bucket
[36:28] &gt;&gt; dropping a bucket to what it's going to
[36:30] be after we leave this place.
[36:35] So [clears throat] everybody okay?
[36:37] Brother Manuel, you uh getting ready to
[36:39] Okay,
[36:41] because I got to make a few
[36:42] announcements. You'll probably need to
[36:45] Everybody [clears throat] appreciate
[36:46] Brother Manuel for doing double double
[36:48] and triple job today
[36:51] and all the time. We sure appreciate
[36:53] everybody. We've got several out and
[36:55] you've got a place to sit today. You
[36:57] pretty much sit where you want to, but
[36:59] we got a lot of people. Uh Brother Luis
[37:01] is in Ohio with his family.

[37:06] family in Tennessee and uh we are um

[39:45] the next Sunday on the 14th. All right.
[39:48] So, communion foot washing will be on

[39:53] service coming up, the service with
[39:55] brother Chris Long will be Sunday the
[39:57] [clears throat] whatever that is 20
[39:58] something. I can't get rid of this. I
[40:01] [clears throat] swallowed a frog
[40:04] rivet.
[40:06] But just remember that coming up and
[40:07] then the watch night service. We're
[40:09] going to post it online that it will be
[40:11] our 54th annual. We have never not had
[40:14] one. From the year we started 1971,
[40:18] [clears throat] we've had 54 straight
[40:20] watch night services coming up this this
[40:23] coming year. So, we look forward to it.
[40:27] A couple brother Dutch Scott and a
[40:28] couple of them from their church are

[40:31] Scott Smith said he may bring some of
[40:33] his people with him. So, we're going to

[40:56] then we'll eat a bite and then we'll go
[40:58] home and uh we appreciate all of you and
[41:02] thank you for your support. So that's
[41:04] Hiddenacres Event Barn. That's the
[41:06] address. Now make sure if you're going
[41:08] put in your GPS Old Gillsville Road.
[41:11] Don't put Gillsville Road. Old
[41:12] Gillsville Road. If you put Gills Road,
[41:15] it'll send you somewhere else. All
[41:17] right. So, being a being a postman, I
[41:19] know that means something. Old Gills
[41:22] Road. All right. Put that in there and
[41:24] you will be able to get there. So, let's
[41:26] [clears throat] turn to First
[41:27] Corinthians. We're going to if you want
[41:28] to keep your Bibles open today, we're
[41:30] going to go to the book of Matthew and
[41:32] we're going to walk through the seals as
[41:34] Jesus preached them. And um and that
[41:36] will kind of give us a foundation to
[41:38] what we're looking at because
[41:41] the seals the seals
[41:45] were preached by Jesus himself as a
[41:48] prophecy.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; All right? And it was for a natural
[41:53] happening.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Keep that in your mind. A natural
[41:56] happening in Matthew 24. Is everybody
[41:59] with me? All right. Then when brother
[42:01] Brandham comes and and when Jesus Christ
[42:04] left the scene, he's the headstone. He's
[42:06] the seventh seal. When he left, all that
[42:09] went with him.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Wasn't revealed to anyone else. Even
[42:14] though he spoke it, they didn't
[42:15] understand what he was talking about.
[42:17] But then in the end time, it had to be
[42:19] open for that to be released back. And
[42:22] Christ, the mighty angel, Revelations
[42:24] 10, had to come down with the book in
[42:26] his hand. That same book that Christ is.
[42:29] Now remember, Christ is the book.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me. Christ is
[42:32] he was standing there with everything
[42:34] you read right here. He was standing
[42:36] there with it inside of himself [snorts]
[42:38] &gt;&gt; because it came from the mind of God.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; So it was sealed up though until the end
[42:43] times so that we can understand and go
[42:45] back to the book of Matthew. We can go
[42:47] back to all the different scriptures
[42:49] that man has probed that many times, but
[42:51] we know the true revelation of what's
[42:54] going to happen. So we'll go to that
[42:56] today and give you the natural
[42:58] happening. Brother Brandham
[43:00] [clears throat] came and when he opened
[43:01] the seals that was a spiritual
[43:02] application.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; All right. And remember they didn't they
[43:07] didn't break to the people in 1963.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Remember he said it's not for you.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Okay? It's not for you to get. But right
[43:17] around the coming of the Lord, there's a
[43:18] group of people that's going to catch
[43:20] that revelation
[43:22] just as Matthew and we'll get into it in
[43:24] just a little while. So, let's bow our
[43:25] heads. Dear heavenly father, thank you
[43:26] for the the [clears throat] song
[43:28] service, Lord. Things that we have uh
[43:30] done, Lord. We've done everything that
[43:31] we all the ordinances that we supposed
[43:34] to do. Now, Lord, I pray that you would
[43:36] Lord, you speak to the people, Father.
[43:39] Lord, you be the one that that does the
[43:41] speaking and also the revealing, Father,
[43:43] because as a human being, there's no way
[43:46] a human being can give another human
[43:48] being a revelation. It has to come from
[43:49] you, Father. [clears throat] And we are
[43:51] revelation people. We love it, Lord,
[43:53] when when we have that moment that that
[43:55] it was that it was closed and now it's
[43:57] revealed. Lord, it's that moment that
[43:59] the light comes on, Father, and we see
[44:01] you more clearly. Father, I pray that
[44:03] you'd be with us now. Be with the ones
[44:05] that are sick, ones that are on the
[44:06] highways. We have many, many that are
[44:08] traveling because of the holidays. I
[44:10] pray that you'd get them all back
[44:11] together safe with us, Lord. Be brother
[44:13] Anderson as he takes off and and
[44:16] [clears throat] heads north. That the
[44:17] roads would be clear, Father.
[44:19] Lord, give us a blessing today. We come
[44:22] Lord looking for a blessing from you
[44:23] father and we're expecting it in Jesus
[44:26] name. Amen. 1 [snorts] Corinthians 2:9.
[44:29] But that as is written eyeath not seen
[44:32] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[44:33] the heart of man the things which God
[44:36] hath prepared for them that what that
[44:39] love him. Most [clears throat] the world
[44:41] don't love him. [snorts]
[44:43] &gt;&gt; You know I know I got you standing but
[44:45] just a minute. I want to talk to sister
[44:47] Regina just for a moment. Is that okay?
[44:49] Me and her. I'm right here with me and
[44:50] her. She's not going to turn red cuz you
[44:53] understand what I'm talking about.
[44:54] [clears throat]
[44:56] When Rex, her brother, Jim's brother was
[45:00] saying the things he said and he asked
[45:01] me that question. He asked me about
[45:03] blasphemy. You ask about why if you say
[45:06] Jesus Christ and they [clears throat]
[45:08] say Jesus Christ,
[45:10] how is that blasphemy and this is not?
[45:14] Well, it's all in how
[45:18] you speak it. All right.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; It comes from their soul.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; All right. Listen. It comes from their
[45:25] soul cuz that's a real them. It comes
[45:28] from their soul though as a derogatory
[45:31] statement.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; It comes from our soul
[45:36] because remember I've been reading
[45:38] scripture folks in Romans.
[45:40] Look at this. Daddy preached this years
[45:42] ago. If you don't put Lord in there,
[45:45] see, they don't say, "I'm sorry, but I'm
[45:47] going to." They don't say, "Lord Jesus
[45:48] Christ." They say Jesus Christ. They're
[45:50] just saying making a statement, but we
[45:52] know he's our Lord.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; He's Jesus Christ to many people, but
[45:58] he's our Lord.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Read in Romans, if you'll keep reading
[46:02] in Romans, I never saw it like that
[46:03] before. You keep reading in Romans, it
[46:05] says, "Lord, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus
[46:08] Christ." We put that on there because we
[46:10] know he's our Lord.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; In the world, they can say that they
[46:14] mean nothing. It's blasphemy.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; If you don't repent, it's blasphemy.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; But he's our Lord.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; And he is the what? He's the curator of
[46:31] my soul.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; He's the one that takes care of it. See,
[46:35] if they would if they would if they
[46:37] would say if they would say, "God,
[46:40] forgive me," they'd know who Jesus
[46:42] Christ is.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; But other than that, it's just words.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; And it's words that are used by the
[46:47] devil himself.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. But he'll never
[46:52] he'll never call him Lord.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want him to be Lord. But you
[46:57] and I, we want him to be our Lord.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Satan will never do that. He will never
[47:02] say, "Oh, Lord." No. because he don't
[47:05] want him to be as Lord and the world
[47:07] don't want him to be as Lord, but they
[47:09] want to say that Jesus Christ the way
[47:11] they say it, you know, it's many, many
[47:12] times we've heard it and it's just
[47:14] become common and and I hate it and I
[47:16] know y'all do too. If it doesn't give a
[47:18] little sting in your heart, then you
[47:19] need a heart transplant.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the name in vain and all
[47:24] that stuff.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz that mean that name means
[47:28] something. But when we put Lord in
[47:30] there, he's our Lord and Master.
[47:33] We know that.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; And I say Jesus Christ. And I can put
[47:37] every moniker there is. Father, son,
[47:40] holy ghost, redeemer, savior, healer,
[47:43] Jehovah, Gyra, Rapha, all we can. That
[47:46] all goes to our mind. What goes through
[47:47] these people's mind is is a derogatory
[47:50] statement towards someone.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; And I hate that. But it's a spirit that
[47:54] Satan puts on them
[47:56] &gt;&gt; to say the word
[47:59] like we say the word. But how does it
[48:02] come? It comes from a heart that loves
[48:05] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Not just this word over here. So, I'm
[48:10] sorry. Let me I just wanted to answer
[48:11] that because it came to me the other day
[48:13] after we talked about it on the phone.
[48:15] So So that was [applause] that was for
[48:17] you. That was to help you
[48:21] [clears throat]
[48:21] cuz you know I mean really they say that
[48:23] word now more than they say the GD word.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; They've done moved up cuz you know what?
[48:29] Satan wants to be their Jesus Christ.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; But they can't.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; He can't.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; No. He's not the Lord Jesus Christ. I'll
[48:39] promise you that.
[48:41] [clears throat]
[48:42] &gt;&gt; All right. Listen.
[48:44] That's why I said prepared for them that
[48:46] love him. Cuz we know who our lover is.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Our lover is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; But God hath revealed them unto us by
[48:52] his spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[48:55] things, yay, the deep things of God or
[48:58] even the inmost depth of God's being.
[49:02] You may be seated and the Lord add his
[49:03] blessing to the reading of the word.
[49:09] But praise God for revelation, for
[49:11] knowledge, for to know that that written
[49:13] word is going to this word right here,
[49:15] this Bible is going to kill
[49:19] &gt;&gt; billions of people.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:22] They can read it [snorts]
[49:25] &gt;&gt; over [clears throat] and over again.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Junior's brother said he read the Bible
[49:28] three times. Three times.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; That's just like reading a That's just
[49:31] like reading a a novel or or a
[49:34] newspaper.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; What do you get out of it?
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[49:39] But you and I are the very word made
[49:42] manifest. When I read that word, there
[49:45] is an imprint. As brother Steven Wilson
[49:46] was talking about, there's a DNA imprint
[49:49] that you and I
[49:52] As Christians have, when we get born
[49:55] again, we receive the DNA of God.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; We still have the DNA that that that
[50:03] mama brought, daddy brought right here.
[50:05] Okay. And you [clears throat] still have
[50:06] that old Adamic nature inside of you if
[50:09] you don't get changed. That's why that
[50:12] Jesus said, "Nicodemus, you must be born
[50:14] again." Not born. And then Nicodemus,
[50:17] what' he say? Have I got go back? Well,
[50:19] see, if he went back in his mama's womb
[50:21] and come out again, he'd still be dead.
[50:23] Yes, sir.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; He'd still have the same DNA he had that
[50:26] the mom and daddy gave.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; But no, Jesus said, "You must be born
[50:30] from above."
[50:32] &gt;&gt; You and I today must be born from above.
[50:35] When we are born from above, we can read
[50:37] the Bible. And the mind of Christ is
[50:39] with us and in us to show us even the
[50:42] little minute details about leaving the
[50:45] word Lord out or putting the word Lord
[50:47] in or having a capital L or a lowercase
[50:50] L. Brother Dale preached that years and
[50:51] years ago and it means something.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[50:56] [clears throat] It means a lot actually.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[51:01] every word of God
[51:03] was predetermined
[51:06] by God himself. before the foundation of
[51:09] the world
[51:10] &gt;&gt; to help us.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Now, I may have Acts 2:38. You may have
[51:16] Acts 19 as your favorite scripture.
[51:19] Mine's Genesis 1:26. But my DNA is woven
[51:22] that.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. That called your name.
[51:26] That's what called you.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Your mom and daddy DIDN'T CALL YOU. GOD
[51:30] CALLED YOU.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; But I want you to remember one thing.
[51:36] Without the DNA of your mother and
[51:38] father, you wouldn't be here today.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; God's not gonna just bring a soul
[51:45] &gt;&gt; without bringing a spirit and a body.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; So, we're a unit. And because of what
[51:50] happened in the fall that we couldn't
[51:51] come by theophony form, we had to come
[51:54] in flesh.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; But remember that theophony is going to
[51:58] be flesh.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We're not getting a
[52:02] different flesh.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; It's this [snorts] one redeemed. This
[52:05] one made new. This one changed. That's
[52:08] why they call it change.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; This one changed in the moment in the
[52:11] twinkling of an eye. We're not going to
[52:12] get started today.
[52:16] [clears throat]
[52:18] &gt;&gt; But now look, but he said it meant it
[52:19] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[52:21] revelation or we fail to get it. So
[52:22] that's what we were talking about when
[52:24] June's brother, I hate to use it, but he
[52:27] called me and said, "What's the
[52:28] difference?" And I said, "Where it comes
[52:30] from?"
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; The source behind it is what the
[52:34] difference is. That's right.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; You say it different than Sister Regina
[52:38] does. Same word, same wording, spelled
[52:42] the same, said the same, but different
[52:45] meanings to different people.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Now listen, let me tell you something
[52:48] else. Let me warn you, though. You can
[52:51] sit here for 40 and 50 years
[52:55] &gt;&gt; and not hear that word.
[53:00] And Jesus will not be your Lord until
[53:03] you let him.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Until you let him. You got to let him be
[53:08] your Lord.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; You can't let everything else be your
[53:11] Lord. You got to let him be your Lord.
[53:13] You say, "Oh, no. God can do what he
[53:15] wants to do." God can do what he wants
[53:17] to do. But remember, he gave you a free
[53:19] will to choose what to do or not.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; If not, he just said, "Adam, you can't
[53:26] do that. You can't do that. You can't do
[53:27] that. you got to do this over here. No,
[53:29] he said, Adam, here you are.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let I'm going to let Eve
[53:33] make her choice. Then she's going to
[53:35] bring it to Adam and Adam's going to
[53:36] make his choice.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; We We burned Eve a lot of times, but
[53:40] Adam's the one that sold us out, folks.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Adam's the one that let all this happen
[53:44] just like it is right now.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; But we love the Lord, don't we?
[53:50] &gt;&gt; But it takes the Holy Spirit. And when
[53:51] that Holy Spirit gives you revelation,
[53:53] you will keep it. It will never leave
[53:55] you. How do you know you got a
[53:57] revelation? It'll always be there.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; It'll always be there, sir.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; It'll never leave you. I don't need
[54:03] Listen, you and I both don't need a
[54:06] revelation of water baptism again.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Now, we can add more to it.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; We can add more to it,
[54:15] &gt;&gt; but there's no more. I MEAN, WHEN I KNOW
[54:17] I got a the the water baptism in the
[54:19] name of Lord Jesus Christ is the only
[54:21] baptism, I don't have to have that
[54:23] revelation again.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; You know why? because that is molded
[54:26] inside of me.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; It is a part of me.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Just like your DNA of your whatever your
[54:32] hair color and your nose and your eyes
[54:34] and your ears and all that stuff. Let me
[54:36] get back to that. [clears throat]
[54:40] &gt;&gt; If you're a bride today,
[54:43] God loves you so much.
[54:45] He handpicked your body.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't like the body I'm in."
[54:52] You better be careful.
[54:54] I don't like the things I do in this
[54:56] body,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; but that's me. Do you hear me? I said I,
[55:00] not God. It's what I do. That is what I
[55:03] hate. I don't hate being alive. Not if
[55:06] I'm born again.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; I don't hate being alive.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; I love being alive.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; But you know what he done? He come way
[55:14] back at the beginning of time. Yes, sir.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; He come down to Noah, Ham, Sham, and
[55:20] Jpath. That's where we all came from.
[55:23] Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Every one of us did.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And he handpicked
[55:27] &gt;&gt; every how many thousands of years to
[55:29] today
[55:31] all the way back. He put this one with
[55:34] this one, this one with this one. You
[55:37] wonder how did my mom and dad get
[55:38] together? God put them together.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; But they were vile. They were this. They
[55:43] were that. They were, you know,
[55:46] that ain't for you to choose. You don't
[55:48] choose how you get here. Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And if you adults know what I'm talking
[55:52] about, during an act, there's thousands
[55:53] of things can happen. There's thousands
[55:55] of germs and thousands of eggs or
[55:57] hundreds of eggs that you could have
[55:59] been anything.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Well, it was one
[56:03] &gt;&gt; God directed that one
[56:06] &gt;&gt; to get your character here to match the
[56:09] character he already knew you'd be in
[56:11] the Bible.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; You got to find your character. What is
[56:15] the character of God? It's in the Bible,
[56:18] but it better be in us. That's why that
[56:19] statue of perfect man is something we
[56:21] got to work on. Sure, it's there. You
[56:23] get everything you need at the baptism
[56:25] of the Holy Ghost.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO USE IT.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO LET [screaming] IT OUT.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; LET GOD DO THE WORK.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm just I'm If you got an
[56:39] uncction to get up and run, Regina, be
[56:41] careful. Get up and run.
[56:45] I pray to the Lord that maybe one day we
[56:47] can expand this building and we can have
[56:49] a Jericho march.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever participated in one of
[56:52] them? I I have. Well, bless y'all's
[56:54] heart.
[56:57] We don't have room to do it up here.
[56:58] We'd run all over each other and get
[57:00] hurt and have to pray for the sick.
[57:02] Right, brother Collie? [laughter]
[57:07] Now, bringing these two thoughts
[57:08] together, you'll see it won't take just
[57:10] ordinary study. See, ordinary people,
[57:12] they they wonder how they got here.
[57:15] Wonder what they're doing here. And like
[57:16] Junior's brother, just when you die, you
[57:18] just go back to dust.
[57:22] I told her, I said, she needs to tell,
[57:23] and I'll tell him next time I see Rex,
[57:26] I'll say, I'll promise you one thing.
[57:28] When you close your eyes in death on
[57:30] this side, you're going to open your
[57:32] eyes somewhere.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; I'll promise you. I'm telling you, these
[57:37] these guys that the popes and all these
[57:39] different things that think that they're
[57:41] so high and mighty and they may be, but
[57:43] when they close their eyes on this side,
[57:45] it's going to be oops moment on that
[57:46] side.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; They ain't going to be where they think
[57:49] they're going to be. And I'll promise
[57:50] you, you can will people can will
[57:52] yourself that all I can do anything I
[57:54] want to cuz I'm not going to be judged.
[57:56] And that's okay. You will be judged
[57:59] &gt;&gt; when you close your eyes here. You going
[58:01] to either be in the fifth dimension or
[58:03] the sixth dimension.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; One of the two. YOU'RE GOING SOMEWHERE
[58:07] &gt;&gt; and then you got to come back to be
[58:09] judged.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Gee, I don't know where that all come
[58:13] from, but it's good. [clears throat]
[58:17] &gt;&gt; It'll take the operation of the Holy
[58:19] Ghost. That means this book, what are we
[58:21] talking about now? The Bible. This book
[58:22] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[58:24] special class of people. It will take
[58:26] one with prophetic insight.
[58:30] That's what we have. We have prophetic
[58:32] insight. When you sit here and you
[58:33] listen to a minister and he gives you
[58:36] the word of God and it becomes a part of
[58:38] you, becomes a revelation, it becomes a
[58:40] part of you, that is your prophetic
[58:43] insight working.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; You're working the gift, but you are
[58:47] prophetic people also.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[58:52] If you've not had a revelation in a long
[58:54] time, you haven't read, studied, or
[58:55] prayed. [snorts]
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. I got one that that
[59:00] when we were talk I got one when I read
[59:02] Romans over here, man. I've been reading
[59:04] Romans and I'm getting some good things
[59:06] out of Romans. I just got started
[59:08] writing stuff down.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You ought to try that sometime.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; It will require the ability to hear from
[59:15] God, not from a human man.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; God, it will require supernatural
[59:21] instruction, not just a student
[59:23] comparing verse with verse. Though that
[59:25] is good. That's good to have a Sunday
[59:28] school teacher.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; It's good to have somebody to come and
[59:30] teach you. But God's going to have to
[59:32] somewhere drive that down into your soul
[59:35] and it stay there
[59:38] &gt;&gt; and it stay there
[59:40] RESIDE INSIDE OF you
[59:42] &gt;&gt; and become you or you become it
[59:44] actually.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; All right. That's the transforming power
[59:49] of the word of God. By the Holy Ghost
[59:52] Lord
[59:52] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost you are transformed.
[59:55] Listen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Who had temperance
[1:00:03] before?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; I knew you was going to do that. Before
[1:00:07] Boy went
[1:00:09] before you got born again,
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; cameras, nobody raised their hand.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; So what? But when you got born again,
[1:00:22] that brought the ability for the
[1:00:24] patience of God
[1:00:26] to come inside of you, not the patience
[1:00:28] of man. Because there are some people,
[1:00:30] we've got a girl that works with us.
[1:00:32] She's just as patient, just as laidback.
[1:00:34] I mean,
[1:00:36] willy-nilly.
[1:00:38] And that's just having normal patience.
[1:00:40] But remember, Brother Ram said the first
[1:00:42] thing you got to do is have patience
[1:00:43] with God. That when you ask him
[1:00:45] something, you're not going to be a
[1:00:46] spoiled brat if he doesn't give it to
[1:00:48] you. You're not going to get on the
[1:00:49] floor and start screaming and bound and
[1:00:50] and pounding the pounding the floor and
[1:00:53] kicking your feet like you would if you
[1:00:55] were a child. You're going to sit there
[1:00:57] and you're going to wait. You're going
[1:00:58] to do what God said. We're going to get
[1:01:00] into that a little bit later in the
[1:01:01] seals. If we will do what God tells us
[1:01:04] to do, we will have a body change.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; But you can't waver and do something
[1:01:12] else.
[1:01:13] You got to do what he's already
[1:01:15] prescribed
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; in this Bible
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; and then the advanced version of the
[1:01:22] 1100 something sermons that we give by a
[1:01:24] prophet which makes it prophetic
[1:01:26] insight.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; All right. [clears throat]
[1:01:29] A mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:01:31] spirit or it never becomes clear. I mean
[1:01:34] how many of us really even in our born
[1:01:36] again experience how many have walked
[1:01:37] for years and did not understand certain
[1:01:40] things? Well, we all need to raise our
[1:01:41] hand on that one. Okay. But
[1:01:45] a mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:01:47] spirit or it never becomes clear how we
[1:01:49] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[1:01:51] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[1:01:54] hear and to know.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; To hear and to know what what you're
[1:01:57] doing here,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; what's your purpose? So, we're prophetic
[1:02:01] people. People with insight. So, now we
[1:02:04] go to Revelations
[1:02:06] 10 11. And he said unto me, thou must
[1:02:08] prophesy again. And who's he talking to?
[1:02:10] He's talking to John.
[1:02:13] All right, John. You eat the book, but
[1:02:16] you're not going to you're not going to
[1:02:17] uh go back to the aisle of Patmas and
[1:02:19] stay there. No. Soon as you get back,
[1:02:21] you going to start writing. You're going
[1:02:23] to start teaching. You're going to start
[1:02:25] preaching.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; God let John lived to be 96 years old
[1:02:30] and he still had his mind and he was
[1:02:32] still teaching people. Brother Ramstead,
[1:02:34] he was the the pastor of the Ephesian
[1:02:36] church because all the other ones had
[1:02:38] been killed. Paul, all the different
[1:02:40] ones, Peter, they're all dead by the
[1:02:42] time that John gets here on Patmas. All
[1:02:44] right. He said unto me, thou must
[1:02:46] prophesy again. So, he has a prophetic
[1:02:49] message, which is that John types to
[1:02:51] what? The bride.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; So, the bride has a prophetic message
[1:02:56] that we're not just going to sit on our
[1:02:58] hands. We're going to speak or preach
[1:03:02] before many people, nations, tongues,
[1:03:03] and kings. All right. So, now as we get
[1:03:06] into the seals, we've already been
[1:03:08] through the numbers, and we're working
[1:03:09] on something that I want to present a
[1:03:11] little bit later on, maybe the first of
[1:03:12] the year [clears throat] as far as the
[1:03:15] numbers that we were talking about, the
[1:03:16] number one, 2, 3, four, all the way to
[1:03:18] number seven. All right?
[1:03:23] So, just hang loose on that. But
[1:03:24] [snorts] we'll uh [clears throat]
[1:03:30] we must see this before we get started.
[1:03:34] Now, [snorts]
[1:03:36] there's many people in the message
[1:03:40] that they believe
[1:03:42] they only take what brother Ram said
[1:03:44] after the seals opened in 1963 and not
[1:03:48] the rest.
[1:03:50] Okay. But now there were things that
[1:03:51] Brother Ram preached before the seals
[1:03:54] that was wrong.
[1:03:57] Don't kick back on me.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; I'll read you where he said it was
[1:04:01] wrong. He said, "Thank God for a prophet
[1:04:04] that wasn't so high and mighty that he
[1:04:06] couldn't tell you what his mistakes
[1:04:08] were. That he couldn't tell you a story
[1:04:11] several hundred times how he almost
[1:04:13] killed himself twice.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Took his own life. Almost killed the
[1:04:17] boys.
[1:04:21] didn't do what God said. So God took his
[1:04:23] baby away from him
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; and wife.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; But you know what? That was for an
[1:04:30] example to show you that William Maron
[1:04:32] Brown was human being that made human
[1:04:35] mistakes, but God protected the gift.
[1:04:38] Yes. Yes.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; That gift had to come until he was taken
[1:04:42] away from us there in December of 1965,
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; whatever time he had the wreck.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Do we believe that?
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; All right. So then he came to literally
[1:04:53] he did come to do two things.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Now this messenger in Malachi 4,
[1:04:58] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:05:00] things. One, according to Malachi 4,
[1:05:02] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:05:04] fathers. Now what did he do? He's going
[1:05:06] to tell us in a minute the years of
[1:05:08] preparation
[1:05:10] was the years of turning us back to
[1:05:14] the truth of the Bible.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; All right. Water baptism, no eternal
[1:05:21] hell, this, that, and the other. All the
[1:05:23] things that he came in that first part
[1:05:26] from 47 to 63, he was he was turning us
[1:05:30] back to the faith of the fathers. Right.
[1:05:33] [snorts]
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Which was the Bible.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. Which was the Bible. All right.
[1:05:42] And in the Bible, it tells, "Believe on
[1:05:44] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[1:05:45] saved." There's a lot that goes in that.
[1:05:48] [snorts]
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And and Brother Brown told us that we
[1:05:50] had to get back to there first because
[1:05:51] God, listen, God cannot work
[1:05:57] ever work
[1:05:59] on false doctrine.
[1:06:02] He can never work on man's ideas.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's why when the seals open, Brother
[1:06:07] Ram said, "I wondered why I hated that
[1:06:09] thing so bad." Cuz he saw the spirit
[1:06:11] behind it. And it wasn't a spirit in the
[1:06:14] drunk house, the drug houses. It was a
[1:06:16] spirit sitting in the church.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; So the second thing according to
[1:06:23] Revelations 10:7 is to bring the
[1:06:26] mysteries.
[1:06:27] Now what's a mystery? something
[1:06:29] previously hidden that now has been made
[1:06:31] known. All right. He will reveal the
[1:06:33] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:06:35] Revelations 10, which are the
[1:06:36] revelations contained in the seven
[1:06:38] seals. And that's what we're going to
[1:06:39] get into cuz he got into them. So, we're
[1:06:40] going to get into them. It will be these
[1:06:42] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:06:44] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:06:45] children to the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:06:47] Now, that word literally,
[1:06:50] I am not almost standing up here today.
[1:06:53] I I'm not standing up here and y'all
[1:06:55] going wondering where I'm at.
[1:06:58] Okay. Right.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; I'm literally standing right here
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; because I am manifesting myself by me
[1:07:05] being here. I'm manifesting I am here.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; So, we wonder where God is. Now, I'm not
[1:07:12] pointing to me. I'm pointing to all of
[1:07:13] us. God is here.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brown's whole even
[1:07:18] through the seals was to tell us that
[1:07:20] God is not up in heaven with his arms
[1:07:23] crossed. He is inside of a group of
[1:07:26] people and that group of people is going
[1:07:29] to defeat the devil standing or sitting
[1:07:34] in bodies that are corrupt.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's his whole that's listen as we
[1:07:41] said before HIS HIS THANKSGIVING message
[1:07:46] was the invisible union.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest messages he ever
[1:07:50] preached. He said, "This is my
[1:07:52] thanksgiving message to you." He said,
[1:07:54] "You have united
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; with the man himself,
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; You are the bride, the virtuous,
[1:08:02] sinless." How do we get that way?
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; He's going to do it.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; YOU AND I ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. HE'S
[1:08:08] GOING TO do it. BUT HE'S GOT TO DO IT BY
[1:08:10] THE WORD OF GOD. AND LET'S DO like Mary
[1:08:12] say that ain't nothing but the truth. Or
[1:08:14] say, "Be it unto me according to thy
[1:08:16] word."
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; But now I thought, let me think about
[1:08:19] this for a minute. No, that's not
[1:08:20] thinking about it for a minute.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Stinking thinking. Remember, if you
[1:08:25] start a conversation with me that says,
[1:08:27] "I thought or think," I know one thing's
[1:08:29] for sure. We got a problem.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; But it will literally turn us back. So,
[1:08:36] it's going to not make us a second
[1:08:38] person of a trinity.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to make us an last immorphy
[1:08:43] of God called a bride.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; [clears throat and cough]
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; We will be
[1:08:51] the bride of Jesus Christ that God
[1:08:54] wanted in the Garden of Eden. [snorts]
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; He wanted a man and a woman in human
[1:08:59] flesh with eternal life, body, spirit,
[1:09:02] and soul. That's what he wanted.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. [snorts]
[1:09:05] [cough]
[1:09:06] He [clears throat] will have that just
[1:09:07] for a moment when we get oursel out of
[1:09:10] the way and get him in the way
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; to change our bodies. Because for 30 to
[1:09:16] 40 days, folks, we're going to have an
[1:09:18] eternal glorified can't be beat. Can't
[1:09:21] be leg don't hurt, head don't hurt, feet
[1:09:25] don't hurt. Hallelujah. Somebody shout
[1:09:27] amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; But we're heading toward that, folks.
[1:09:31] But it's going to be it ain't going to
[1:09:33] be it's not g it's going to be like a
[1:09:35] light switch. I believe [snorts]
[1:09:38] you know why? Because I don't believe
[1:09:40] it's going to be well my arm don't hurt
[1:09:42] but boy my leg sure hurts. No, when you
[1:09:44] get a body change it's going to be
[1:09:46] Abraham go to bed.
[1:09:50] [laughter]
[1:09:50] Abraham go sleep.
[1:09:54] Cuz when Sarah at the time of life which
[1:09:57] is 28 days you sisters know what I'm
[1:09:59] talking about. He said, "According to
[1:10:00] the time of life, I'll visit you." Well,
[1:10:04] what did he visit them with?
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; A body change.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That he went to bed one night. The next
[1:10:11] morning, he woke up and thought, "Where
[1:10:13] have I been put
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Sarah?"
[1:10:20] make you excited.
[1:10:24] [clears throat]
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; But that was in natural type in the
[1:10:26] spiritual
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; because you know what? Abraham finally
[1:10:30] died. Sarah finally died. They had aches
[1:10:33] and pains and heartache. She had
[1:10:35] several, you know, when she had kids,
[1:10:37] she had she had problems and then their
[1:10:40] [clears throat] body eventually went
[1:10:41] back and they died.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; This time it's not going to happen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; This time when Melzdc visits our tent,
[1:10:49] Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. When Melzdc visits
[1:10:53] our tent,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; he come to he come to Abraham's tent
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm going to visit you
[1:11:00] according to the time of life." Well,
[1:11:02] he's going to visit us according to the
[1:11:04] time of life.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody [clears throat] with me?
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; So, what is a mystery? It's a hidden
[1:11:10] hidden or secret thing. Not obvious.
[1:11:12] Listen, not obvious to the
[1:11:14] understanding.
[1:11:16] Okay? So, revelation
[1:11:19] revelation to me sometimes is awkward
[1:11:23] cuz it's not what I previously thought.
[1:11:25] You think, man, I've been wrong this
[1:11:27] whole time. Well, brother Brown said the
[1:11:28] same thing.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He said, I'd have been I made a horrible
[1:11:32] mistake. I'm going to read you all
[1:11:33] these. I read the seventh seal this
[1:11:34] morning, and he said, all these that has
[1:11:37] opened has been contrary to anything I
[1:11:40] thought it was. He thought that fifth
[1:11:42] seal Jew was us under the altar crying
[1:11:44] how long. How wrong was that?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T call for somebody to avenge the
[1:11:51] blood.
[1:11:53] [snorts]
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; No. Right. No.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; And we're not going to a sick seal
[1:11:57] judgment here on earth.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; We're going through that now inside
[1:12:02] here. Your nature is being disrupted.
[1:12:05] You're having earthquakes. You're having
[1:12:07] tsunamis. You're having all kinds of
[1:12:10] things in your life and even in your
[1:12:11] body.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But God's going to just listen. He
[1:12:15] disrupted Abraham's nature. That's for
[1:12:16] sure.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Him and Sarah both.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; But now remember, he changed Sarah, but
[1:12:23] he had to what? He had to restore a womb
[1:12:24] because she couldn't have babies. They
[1:12:26] didn't have babies for 70 something
[1:12:28] years. They were together.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; We'll get to that maybe later on.
[1:12:33] [snorts]
[1:12:33] So, a hidden purpose or counsel, a
[1:12:36] secret will, that's what it is. It's a
[1:12:38] secret will of God. People are going to
[1:12:40] read this will today, which is the
[1:12:43] Bible, and they're going to preach a
[1:12:45] father, son, holy ghost. They're going
[1:12:47] to preach an eternal hell. They're going
[1:12:50] to preach it don't matter what you do.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Same book.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; We ain't got a different one. We got the
[1:12:57] same one.
[1:12:59] [snorts]
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; But what we do is we see the secret will
[1:13:02] of God as in the U analogy there with
[1:13:05] Jesus and Jesus Christ. We know who he
[1:13:07] is. And I dare
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I dare and you dare either blasphem his
[1:13:12] name. Listen, you can't do it if you're
[1:13:15] born again.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; You cannot
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; cuz blasphemy is the only thing can get
[1:13:21] you out of heaven. Right?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Blaspheming the Holy Ghost, which means
[1:13:25] you didn't have it and you'll never get
[1:13:27] it because you blasphemed it away. You
[1:13:29] you send away your day of grace.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; But if you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; you can't do that.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; All right. There's no way possible God
[1:13:39] may take you off the scene like he did
[1:13:41] that preacher that time that started
[1:13:43] drinking beer and said, "I don't want to
[1:13:44] preach no more. I don't want to." God
[1:13:46] said he got an evil spirit on him and
[1:13:48] God took him home so he wouldn't mar his
[1:13:50] name. [snorts]
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Just like brother Brandham. He didn't
[1:13:54] try to kill himself in his spirit in his
[1:13:55] soul.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; He was in his spirit realm. His memory,
[1:13:59] reason, conscious effects, and
[1:14:00] imagination. That's what bothers us. If
[1:14:02] we listen, if we don't let that soul
[1:14:05] inside of us which is born again, if we
[1:14:08] don't let that soul do the work and do
[1:14:10] the talking or or raise UP AND WE'LL ALL
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; do things wrong.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; We do things wrong anyway, but we'll
[1:14:18] really do things wrong. That's the
[1:14:20] reason we couldn't that's the reason we
[1:14:21] weren't
[1:14:23] Let me put it this way. That's the
[1:14:25] reason we weren't held accountable
[1:14:28] before we were born again.
[1:14:32] Well, think about it.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; No, y'all say a cuss word before you got
[1:14:37] born again. That's what I thought.
[1:14:43] Might have even said the bad word.
[1:14:45] Several of them. But God didn't count
[1:14:49] that against you when he saved you and
[1:14:51] you got born again.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Tell me what he did with it.
[1:14:58] HE PUT IT IN THE SEA OF GOD'S
[1:14:59] FORGETFULNESS, NEVER TO REMEMBER IT
[1:15:01] AGAIN. PEOPLE, THAT'S GRACE. THAT'S WHY
[1:15:03] HE'S GOING TO HAVE A VIRTUOUS, SINLESS
[1:15:06] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WITHOUT SPOT OR
[1:15:09] WRINKLE.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; THAT OUGHT TO MAKE YOU SOMEBODY OUGHT TO
[1:15:12] BE EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, I'M THIS." DON'T WORRY
[1:15:16] ABOUT IT.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE PROVIDED WAY OF GOD.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; HE'LL WORK YOU THROUGH THAT.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:15:24] But you got to make sure you yield
[1:15:25] yourself to it first
[1:15:28] [snorts]
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; cuz I yielded myself to the devil out
[1:15:30] there.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Well, me and brother Donny's only two
[1:15:34] people. Maybe brother Boyd. He said,
[1:15:36] "Amen, man." Yeah. So,
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; all of us did.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; We yielded our members. Even Paul did.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Even Paul. PAUL SAID, "THE THINGS I DO
[1:15:46] NOT, I DO.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, but I do it. I do
[1:15:50] want to do this and and when I want to
[1:15:52] do good, evil's present.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Man, we listen.
[1:15:58] One [snorts] thing's for sure. Every
[1:16:00] example that we have in the Bible
[1:16:03] of people that are our
[1:16:06] um pillars
[1:16:09] are flawed
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; except one,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:16:17] EVERY ONE OF THEM PETER CURSED
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; THREE TIMES.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Paul persecuted the Christians,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; the very people that he preached to
[1:16:28] later on.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Abraham laughed at God.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Give his wife away twice.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:16:39] The hall of faith and the hall of the
[1:16:44] statues of [snorts] the believers that
[1:16:47] we
[1:16:48] are saying that are our foundation all
[1:16:52] had flaws.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; They all had flaws. But you know what
[1:16:56] they looked to? They
[1:17:00] without us.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; They were looking though, brothers and
[1:17:05] sisters. They didn't know us by name.
[1:17:06] They didn't know that we'd need a
[1:17:08] prophet. They didn't know we'd be
[1:17:09] sitting in Lula, Georgia. We'd be
[1:17:10] sitting wherever we're sitting. They
[1:17:12] didn't know you by name. Oh, they will.
[1:17:15] But they were looking for a group of
[1:17:17] people by the spirit of God. There was a
[1:17:19] group of people that they were yearning
[1:17:21] to see bring this thing
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; to a culmination
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; because they listen Hebrews 11 is what?
[1:17:31] That's the chapter of faith. RIGHT?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; READ ALL THEM NAMES and you get down to
[1:17:35] the very bottom and Paul said they all
[1:17:38] had a good report. They all loved the
[1:17:40] Lord. They all did the best they could.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But they without us
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; cannot be made perfect.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; We [clears throat] got to start being in
[1:17:51] that group.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; You cannot be perfect. You and I both.
[1:17:59] Either one. But there's a perfect word
[1:18:02] that we can attach oursel to. [snorts]
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Because remember, I want you to remember
[1:18:08] right now today, if you're born again
[1:18:09] today, that perfect one is inside you.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; It's not in heaven.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; It's not over the sea.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; It's neither. It's inside of you. That
[1:18:18] new birth that you have is a perfect
[1:18:20] person.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; People say, "You ain't perfect. I ain't
[1:18:27] perfect." Well, which one of you you
[1:18:29] talking about?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Which [snorts and clears throat] one of
[1:18:32] you you talking about? Because there's
[1:18:34] one inside of me that is.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; But remember, if he's inside of you,
[1:18:38] he'll start showing it.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; That says stature of a what?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; What does that say?
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; All together
[1:18:46] of a
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; perfect man.
[1:18:51] [clears throat]
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; And that's for us to live.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; That's for us to live.
[1:18:58] Now, Brother [snorts] Brown tells us the
[1:19:00] mysteries will be revealed in the last
[1:19:02] day
[1:19:03] when the seventh [clears throat] angel
[1:19:04] messenger comes. Not when he starts out
[1:19:07] doing this, but when he begins to sound
[1:19:09] his message. Brother knew that his
[1:19:12] message started when the seals
[1:19:15] were revealed. That [clears throat] was
[1:19:17] his main goal. That was his main
[1:19:18] purpose. That was his message. [snorts]
[1:19:20] All the others was to bring us to a
[1:19:22] place. All right. Now, look. says, "Not
[1:19:24] the years in preparation, but when he
[1:19:27] begins to sound the message, these
[1:19:28] mysteries then will be revealed." And
[1:19:30] here they are not knowing them, and you
[1:19:32] people are witness of it. They're
[1:19:34] sitting [clears throat] right there
[1:19:35] listening to him, watching him.
[1:19:40] So now, if you have your Bibles, you can
[1:19:41] turn there, but let's go to Matthew 24.
[1:19:43] Now, Brother Brown, [snorts]
[1:19:45] he waits till the sixth seal.
[1:19:50] Now, listen to me. [snorts] He did not
[1:19:53] know this in seal number one that the
[1:19:56] seals had already been preached.
[1:20:02] God had to wait till he got to the sixth
[1:20:04] seal.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:20:09] To reveal to him that Jesus already
[1:20:12] preached him in Matthew 24.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; The angel took him back
[1:20:18] said, "Hey, the Lord's already preached
[1:20:20] these." But see, now I want you
[1:20:22] [clears throat] to understand this is in
[1:20:24] its
[1:20:26] natural form. When Jesus preaches this,
[1:20:28] they ask him, "All right, let's start
[1:20:30] right here. [clears throat] Give me a
[1:20:32] few minutes." And when Jesus went out
[1:20:34] and departed from the temple, and his
[1:20:37] disciples came to him for to show him
[1:20:39] the buildings of the temple, and Jesus
[1:20:42] said unto them,
[1:20:43] "See ye not all these things? Verily I
[1:20:46] say unto you, there shall not be left
[1:20:47] one stone upon another that shall not be
[1:20:50] thrown down. Now he's talking about a
[1:20:52] natural building. Everybody with me? All
[1:20:54] right. Natural temple. They built it in
[1:20:57] 40some years. And he said it was going
[1:20:59] to be totally destroyed. Now we know he
[1:21:04] was telling them that Titus uh the
[1:21:07] Gentiles were going to come and and
[1:21:08] obliterate the town.
[1:21:11] All right. They didn't catch it at
[1:21:12] first, but I believe they caught it
[1:21:13] later on.
[1:21:15] in his sermon.
[1:21:19] [clears throat]
[1:21:19] And [snorts] as he sat upon the Mount of
[1:21:21] Olives, the disciples came unto him
[1:21:23] privately, saying, Tell us,
[1:21:25] [clears throat] when is this going to
[1:21:26] happen?
[1:21:28] [cough]
[1:21:29] [snorts] What shall be the sign of thy
[1:21:31] coming
[1:21:32] and of the end of the world?
[1:21:35] Brother Bram [clears throat] said, and I
[1:21:36] don't know how he knew it, but he must
[1:21:38] have went back into history or the Lord
[1:21:39] revealed it to him. If you'll look in
[1:21:40] the seal book, Brother Rime said they
[1:21:43] asked him those three questions in the
[1:21:44] morning and he answered them in the
[1:21:46] afternoon. So, April the 4th, AD30, he
[1:21:50] comes down to a day cuz it was right
[1:21:51] before he was crucified. All right. So,
[1:21:54] he pre the last come on somebody. The
[1:21:56] last great message he preached was the
[1:21:58] seals.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; He died right after this because April
[1:22:03] the 4th was whatever day that was and if
[1:22:05] you'll go through Daniel 70 weeks, he
[1:22:07] died on like the 7th or 8th or somewhere
[1:22:09] in there. So he was right at leaving the
[1:22:11] place, leaving the earth. And he sat on
[1:22:13] the Mount of Olives. The disciples came
[1:22:15] and said, "When shall these things be?
[1:22:19] What shall be the sign of thy coming and
[1:22:21] of the end of the world?" All right.
[1:22:23] Now, Brother Brown breaks them down, but
[1:22:25] we're going to we're going to go through
[1:22:26] them just really slow just for a minute.
[1:22:27] Is everybody all right? All right. It's
[1:22:29] a little warm in here, but it's 71,
[1:22:31] [snorts]
[1:22:33] so just shake yourself for a minute.
[1:22:36] Now, [snorts] what was the first seal?
[1:22:39] It was a white horse rider. Had a bow
[1:22:42] with no arrows,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; a bluff, and it was the devil.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; All right, we're going to get into it
[1:22:50] later on, but this is going to help us.
[1:22:52] If you'll go back and read in the
[1:22:54] scripture, Jesus preached, now look,
[1:22:58] Jesus preached six seals.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; All right? He did not preach number
[1:23:04] seven
[1:23:05] cuz he was number seven. He was the head
[1:23:08] of the church. He was the headstone
[1:23:11] that's got to come back in the end time
[1:23:13] in a group of people.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; All right. Everybody with me?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; All right. So Jesus answered and said
[1:23:19] unto them, this is verse four, take heed
[1:23:21] that no man deceive you. What happened
[1:23:24] in the first horse rider? white
[1:23:27] righteous
[1:23:29] church
[1:23:31] went riding out and it was the devil
[1:23:34] himself riding on a religious white
[1:23:37] horse.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And even brother Brandham was fooled.
[1:23:41] Come on somebody.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; He preached the mighty conqueror and he
[1:23:44] re he read that scripture that he was a
[1:23:48] mighty conqueror and he'll I he read it
[1:23:49] on the first seal and I'll read it to
[1:23:51] you later on. So I'm not I'm not saying
[1:23:54] anything about brother Bradom. is just
[1:23:55] one thing. God led him through
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; to that perfection
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; that he was trying to get to from 47 to
[1:24:03] 63. Is everybody with me?
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; He listen, he said if if we don't he
[1:24:07] said we're just presuming today if this
[1:24:09] thing don't open.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Presuming is what? Venturing without
[1:24:13] authority. Well, I'll promise you when
[1:24:15] brother Brandham was sitting in that
[1:24:16] room, come on, somebody. WHEN HE WAS
[1:24:18] SITTING IN THAT ROOM AND THAT angel came
[1:24:20] in that room and said, "William Brandom,
[1:24:22] THAT'S NOT RIGHT." WHAT WOULD YOU DONE?
[1:24:25] You'd sold up and left church and had
[1:24:27] your own little place at the house and
[1:24:28] just you threw and all.
[1:24:31] What? What do you mean I'm wrong?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; No. You know what brother said?
[1:24:38] He said he was right and I was wrong.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; But I'll guarantee you he just didn't
[1:24:43] take it. I'll guarantee you he started
[1:24:45] going through scriptures and started
[1:24:46] reading scripture cuz he was a scripture
[1:24:48] prophet. He was a word prophet.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And when the angel told him, he said,
[1:24:53] "Oh, oh no. Oh, wow. This is what I
[1:24:55] preached before. This was my old notes I
[1:24:57] was going back to preach on." But
[1:24:59] contrary, totally. He said, "I see now
[1:25:03] what that is. That's a w cuz remember,
[1:25:05] he'll tell you that he preached and and
[1:25:08] others had preached that the white horse
[1:25:10] was the Holy Ghost and that he was
[1:25:12] riding through the church ages shooting
[1:25:14] his arrows of love into the people. You
[1:25:18] can't shoot arrows of love if you don't
[1:25:20] have no arrows.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's how that's how deceived we can
[1:25:24] get. But when he looked down, he said,
[1:25:27] and I'm sure that angel was I'm sure
[1:25:29] that angel was standing right there with
[1:25:30] him.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Karn, I I believe that
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; that angel had been with him the whole
[1:25:36] time. And I believe he was going
[1:25:38] read that right there.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Bow, no arrows.
[1:25:44] How you gonna shoot with no arrows?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; This guy must be a bluff
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; because he's bluffing the people.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I believe that. That's what I believe
[1:25:55] cuz it came straight from God.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; It came straight from God.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered, listen, you see
[1:26:03] what's been given us in this generation.
[1:26:06] God came down himself
[1:26:08] [cough]
[1:26:09] into [snorts] a prophet
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; to tell us the correct interpretation of
[1:26:13] the whole Bible
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; and left us with 1100 sermons of it and
[1:26:18] kept it where we could read it whenever
[1:26:20] we wanted to or listen to it. We have no
[1:26:24] excuse.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; None whatsoever. [snorts]
[1:26:28] Take heed that no man deceive you. Now
[1:26:30] this is Jesus telling the disciples
[1:26:33] the seals
[1:26:35] in the natural form. All right, is
[1:26:38] everybody with me?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:26:41] take heed that no man deceive you. For
[1:26:45] many, not one, not two, not three, TV
[1:26:49] evangelist,
[1:26:51] [snorts]
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; many
[1:26:54] shall come in my name, Jesus Christ,
[1:26:59] saying, I am Christ
[1:27:02] the anointed one,
[1:27:05] and shall deceive
[1:27:08] many.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Many is going to come in my name and
[1:27:11] gonna deceive many.
[1:27:13] All right. So, brother Ry on the sixth
[1:27:15] seal. Now, watch. This is what he I'll
[1:27:18] I'll just read his uh commentary on it
[1:27:20] for the first one. Notice now we're
[1:27:22] going to read first for the then he
[1:27:24] answered them. He's going to start
[1:27:27] answering them. Now, we want to compare
[1:27:28] it with the seals. Now, watch the first
[1:27:30] seal. Revelation 6 1-2. Now, we read 6
[1:27:34] 1-2. And I saw [clears throat] the lamb
[1:27:36] who had opened one of the seals. And I
[1:27:38] heard as it was a noise of thunder, one
[1:27:40] of the four beasts, which was the lion,
[1:27:42] L I O N, saying, Come and see. And I
[1:27:45] saw, and behold, a white horse, and he
[1:27:47] that sat on him had a bow. And a crown
[1:27:50] was given unto him, and he went forth
[1:27:53] conquering and to conquer.
[1:27:56] Who did we find this fellow was?
[1:27:58] Antichrist.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, now what? Jesus told him right here.
[1:28:05] He told him, "Take heed that no man
[1:28:08] deceive you." The greatest deceiver in
[1:28:10] the world is the Antichrist.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; He will deceive 99% of this whole world.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WHOLE world
[1:28:21] is deceived at this moment. Right.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Even though there's a billion Christians
[1:28:28] in the world, two billion Christians in
[1:28:30] the world, how many of them really
[1:28:34] are born again?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, there you can be a Christian
[1:28:38] and not be born again. Come on,
[1:28:40] somebody.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; You can you be foolish virgin or you can
[1:28:43] be, you know, you can be at a place of
[1:28:45] justification and and that's all you
[1:28:47] know. We not putting nobody out. I'd
[1:28:49] rather just pile them all in,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; but I ain't gonna pile in garbage.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] [snorts]
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; For many shall come, look in my name,
[1:28:59] white, white righteous church, white
[1:29:00] horse, cuz who's the only righteous one?
[1:29:03] If you go over Revelations 19, who's
[1:29:05] sitting on a white horse?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And he has on his thigh the word of God,
[1:29:11] right? So if if man reads that and goes,
[1:29:14] "Well, there's Jesus on a white horse.
[1:29:16] This must be Jesus on a Satan goes,
[1:29:19] "Huh, John's wrote that. So, I'm gonna
[1:29:21] take that white horse thing and I'm
[1:29:23] gonna deceive a bunch of people with it
[1:29:25] because they going to think I'm him."
[1:29:27] [snorts]
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; All right. So, you think about these
[1:29:30] little elementary things as we go
[1:29:31] through the seals. What was what was
[1:29:34] sealed up
[1:29:36] was a mystery of where Satan was
[1:29:40] and who he was.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Right? Now remember the seals are the
[1:29:45] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; but it exposes the devil.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because remember Satan is not the
[1:29:54] originator of anything.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; So you can't be well the seals reveal
[1:30:00] the antichrist. No, it reveals Jesus
[1:30:03] Christ.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Here stands a lamb with a book in his
[1:30:07] hand and there goes an impostor.
[1:30:09] Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; So, it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:30:13] exposing the Antichrist.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; So, don't think one thing's for sure.
[1:30:20] You get this great revelation of who
[1:30:22] Satan was. No, you're going to see.
[1:30:24] Yeah, you are going to find out who he
[1:30:25] is, what he's doing, and where he's at.
[1:30:28] But once but you got to have a re
[1:30:31] you got to have a revelation of where
[1:30:33] Jesus is first.
[1:30:36] Because remember, we're going to read a
[1:30:37] little bit later on if we can get to it.
[1:30:39] If we don't, we'll do it next week
[1:30:41] [clears throat] where he said that many
[1:30:44] will come in my name. I read that. But
[1:30:47] remember, you read a little bit later on
[1:30:49] down through that chapter, he says
[1:30:51] they'll come and say, uh, Christ is over
[1:30:54] here.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Christ is in je
[1:30:57] Christ is in
[1:30:59] Lula,
[1:31:01] [snorts]
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Jeffersonville,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Ohio. Yes.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; No. If you got him in you, you don't
[1:31:12] have to go look for him.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus was saying. If I be in
[1:31:17] you, you don't have to go look for it.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Don't go look for Christ. Christ is
[1:31:21] here.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Christ in what? In you, the hope of
[1:31:26] glory.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Now watch. He's going to start
[1:31:30] answering. Now we want to compare.
[1:31:32] Remember they ask him three questions.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; I watched the first seals, Revelation
[1:31:35] 6:1. And I saw the lamb when he had
[1:31:37] opened one of the seals,
[1:31:40] [cough] excuse me. [clears throat] And I
[1:31:41] heard as it was the noise of a thunder,
[1:31:44] and one of the four beasts, saying,
[1:31:45] "Come and see." I saw, and behold, a
[1:31:47] white horse, and he that sat on him had
[1:31:49] a bow, and a crown was given unto him,
[1:31:51] and he went forth conquering and to
[1:31:53] conquer. Who did we find this fellow
[1:31:55] was? Because remember, this is in the
[1:31:57] sixth seal. So, he's already revealed
[1:32:00] five seals and comes to the sixth seal.
[1:32:02] All right?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered, no. Yeah. Matthew 24
[1:32:06] now 4:5. And Jesus answered and said
[1:32:07] unto them, "Take heed that no man
[1:32:09] deceive you, for many shall come in my
[1:32:11] name, saying, I am Christ, and shall
[1:32:13] deceive many." See it, Antichrist.
[1:32:16] There's your seal.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Now listen, the seal is not the
[1:32:19] Antichrist. The seal is the exposing of
[1:32:23] the Antichrist
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; and the revealing of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:26] Because we're going to see that the
[1:32:28] first seal shows you one true and living
[1:32:30] God. Because brother Brown said, he
[1:32:32] said, "Here stands a lamb and there goes
[1:32:33] another fella." He said, "Therefore,
[1:32:36] if you got two, they both can't be God.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; They both could be the devil."
[1:32:42] But but you know, if he's a lamb
[1:32:44] standing here and one rides off, brother
[1:32:47] Dy, who? That's the devil.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; There's only two powers.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; All right. See Antichrist, there's your
[1:32:54] seal. Now the second one,
[1:32:58] the red horse.
[1:33:00] You shall hear of wars and rumors of
[1:33:02] wars. See that you be not troubled. Now
[1:33:05] remember, wars are connected to what?
[1:33:08] There's never been a war that there's
[1:33:10] not been a death
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; or a killing because that's [snorts]
[1:33:13] what wars do.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Wars kill. And you shall hear of wars
[1:33:18] and rumors because remember the red
[1:33:20] horse is red blood red. All right. See
[1:33:24] that ye be not troubled, for all these
[1:33:26] things must come to pass, but the end is
[1:33:28] not yet. He's saying, "Oh, hang on a
[1:33:29] minute. You're going to hear many wars,
[1:33:32] rumors of wars. We hear them right now."
[1:33:34] Hey, listen. Y'all see yesterday where
[1:33:36] uh Trump was at the G7 summit. They
[1:33:40] called him back. He flew back to
[1:33:41] Washington DC. Did you see what he
[1:33:43] tweeted this morning? He said, "Theron,
[1:33:45] you better get your people out of there
[1:33:47] right now."
[1:33:50] They kind of figured out that they're
[1:33:52] still making nuclear bombs. He'll level
[1:33:54] that place. You wait and see. And then
[1:33:56] that's going to start. I was telling me,
[1:33:57] me and somebody was talking in the back,
[1:33:59] you got to have everything culminating
[1:34:01] with the Middle East.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Everything will culminate in the Middle
[1:34:05] East, right?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Everything. The Bible tell doesn't tell
[1:34:10] us that it's going to be over here over
[1:34:11] here. Battle of Armageddon is going to
[1:34:13] be in the Valley of Megiddo. Where is
[1:34:15] that at?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Middle East.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, you got Iran, Iraq, and
[1:34:18] all these different people that want to
[1:34:20] kill Israel.
[1:34:23] [snorts]
[1:34:23] So, just just watch if he does what he
[1:34:25] says. Now, that he's a president that'll
[1:34:27] pretty much do what he say he's going to
[1:34:28] do. May be right, maybe wrong. But if he
[1:34:31] told them from the people in Tehran,
[1:34:33] they need two they got two days, I
[1:34:34] think, to get out of the city. You know
[1:34:36] what's coming. Something's going to
[1:34:38] happen. But when you do that, see, then
[1:34:40] you got a political you got a political
[1:34:42] war first,
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Jockeying back and forth with words.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; All right. But then there's going to be
[1:34:48] a natural happening.
[1:34:51] It's not to scare you, but just be
[1:34:52] alert.
[1:34:54] All right? So, [clears throat] red horse
[1:34:55] and you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[1:34:57] wars. See that you be not troubled, for
[1:34:59] all these things must come to pass, but
[1:35:01] the end is not yet. Now, when when Jesus
[1:35:03] spoke this in the year 8030,
[1:35:07] there has been tens of thousands of wars
[1:35:10] since that day he said that.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they'll [clears throat]
[1:35:14] culminate in one. But he said, "Don't
[1:35:15] worry. This is not the one,
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? This is not the one
[1:35:20] you got to worry about. There's going to
[1:35:22] be people fighting all the time, but
[1:35:24] there's going to be one that you better
[1:35:26] worry about. There's going to be one way
[1:35:28] on over here in the sixth seal that you
[1:35:29] better be not be here, and that's at the
[1:35:31] tribulation.
[1:35:33] All right? [clears throat]
[1:35:35] So, that's the red horse. What is red?
[1:35:37] Red's killing. Now, the second seal,
[1:35:40] Matthew 24:6, Revelation 6 3 and 4. Now,
[1:35:43] watch. Matthew 24:6. Now, let's see what
[1:35:45] it says. And you shall hear of wars and
[1:35:47] rumors of wars. See that you be not
[1:35:49] troubled, for all these things must come
[1:35:50] to pass, but the end is not yet. All
[1:35:53] right, let's take the second seal.
[1:35:54] Revelation 6 3:2. Watch what he says
[1:35:57] now. And when he had opened the second
[1:36:00] seal, I heard the second beast say,
[1:36:01] "Come and see." And there went forth
[1:36:04] another horse that was read, and power
[1:36:06] was given to him that said on there to
[1:36:08] what? Take peace.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; What is war? War is not peace.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. to take peace from the
[1:36:16] earth. So there'll be wars and rumors of
[1:36:18] wars. Take peace from the earth for the
[1:36:20] for the second seal. They should kill
[1:36:23] one another. That's what war.
[1:36:26] And there was given to him a great sword
[1:36:28] or a word perfectly. Just exactly. Oh, I
[1:36:31] like to make the scriptures answer
[1:36:33] itself. Don't you? The Holy Spirit wrote
[1:36:35] it all,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; but he's able to reveal it.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Third seal is what? The black
[1:36:41] horse.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; This is this is continuing to tell us
[1:36:45] about natural things because nations
[1:36:48] will rise against nation, kingdom
[1:36:51] against kingdom, and there shall be
[1:36:53] famines and pestilence and earthquakes
[1:36:55] in many places. Now, that's happening
[1:36:58] right now. All right. All these things
[1:37:01] are the beginning of sorrows, not the
[1:37:04] end, the beginning of sorrow. All right.
[1:37:07] [clears throat]
[1:37:09] Now, brother Ram said, "Look, and nation
[1:37:11] shall rise against nation, kingdom
[1:37:12] against kingdom, famines, pestilence,
[1:37:14] earthquakes, all these things are the
[1:37:16] beginning of sorrow. See, you're coming
[1:37:18] right on up." Revelation 6th chapter.
[1:37:20] Now, we're going to open the third seal.
[1:37:22] It's found in Revelation. We just read
[1:37:23] it. We had opened the third seal. The
[1:37:25] third beast said, "Come and see." And a
[1:37:27] black horse went out, and he that sat on
[1:37:28] him had a pair of balances in his hand.
[1:37:30] And I heard a voice in the midst of the
[1:37:32] four beast, saying, "A measure of penny,
[1:37:34] [clears throat] measure of barley for a
[1:37:35] penny, measure of wheat for a penny, and
[1:37:36] three measures of barley for a penny.
[1:37:38] See the hurt not the oil and wine."
[1:37:40] Exact same seal, exact same thing. Now,
[1:37:42] I want to tell you something. When we
[1:37:44] get into the seals,
[1:37:46] [cough and clears throat]
[1:37:47] there's only one time that that God
[1:37:49] himself speaks out when the seals break.
[1:37:53] Everybody with me?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; He just did right here.
[1:37:58] And I heard a voice in the midst of the
[1:38:00] four beasts say,
[1:38:02] all right, see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:38:06] wine. Brother R explain it to you.
[1:38:07] That's God himself saying, do what you
[1:38:10] need to do, but you be careful and don't
[1:38:12] hurt the oil and the wine,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; which is a type of stimulation of
[1:38:16] revelation and the Holy Ghost. So he's
[1:38:18] telling us, he's saying you're not going
[1:38:19] to do away with the Holy Ghost. All
[1:38:21] right?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But there'll be a famine. Remember the
[1:38:26] Bible says there'll be a famine for
[1:38:27] what? Not for not for for food.
[1:38:31] How many still eating on their
[1:38:32] Thanksgiving dinner? That's what I
[1:38:34] thought. So we're we not got that kind
[1:38:37] of famine. But the Bible says a famine
[1:38:39] for hearing of the word of God.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Having all kind of excuses to be here
[1:38:44] and there and everywhere.
[1:38:47] I'm going to tell you one more time,
[1:38:50] just like brother Steven Wilson said,
[1:38:52] Holy Ghost people go to church.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost fil people go to church.
[1:38:58] That's just if you don't come all the
[1:39:00] time, then listen, you can't get the
[1:39:02] Holy Ghost sometime.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; I just thought of that. You can't You
[1:39:10] can't just get the Holy Ghost sometime.
[1:39:12] You can get an anointing. Well, I need
[1:39:13] to go to church so they'll talk about
[1:39:14] me. No, you need to go to church so God
[1:39:16] can talk to you. Forget about me up
[1:39:18] here, BUT YOU IT'S FOR YOUR SOUL.
[1:39:21] [applause]
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; It's not for your money. It's not for
[1:39:24] anything. It's for your soul.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SOUL TO GET FED, YOU CANNOT SET
[1:39:29] HOME.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Tell me how you can do it.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Tell me how.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me how you cannot.
[1:39:39] Your soul has to be fed by a five-fold
[1:39:42] ministry. The Bible says for the
[1:39:44] perfecting of the saints.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; See, if you have a problem with that,
[1:39:50] you don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz the Holy Ghost inside of you wants
[1:39:55] you to get perfect.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; He's perfect already. Just like I said,
[1:40:00] but there's [clears throat] imperfection
[1:40:01] around that, which is called Esther
[1:40:04] Smallwood.
[1:40:05] [snorts]
[1:40:08] I'm using her because if y'all some of
[1:40:11] y'all the other ones, you get mad. But
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; but there's there's there's eternity
[1:40:16] spinning around.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, honestly, there's eternity
[1:40:20] spinning around in your soul if you're
[1:40:21] born again.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And it's wanting to catch
[1:40:26] your spirit
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; and show you things by revelation that
[1:40:30] this is not right or this is right or
[1:40:32] this. It's trying to catch that.
[1:40:34] Remember what brother Ram always said?
[1:40:36] He said, 'I'll bring them up to the
[1:40:37] platform and he said, 'The reason I talk
[1:40:39] to them is to what? Catch their spirit.
[1:40:44] Now also now he will come. Some people
[1:40:47] walk up. He said, "Oh sister, I see
[1:40:48] you've got the Holy Ghost." He said, he
[1:40:50] said, "You have a a warm feeling or you
[1:40:52] have a kindred feeling between me and
[1:40:54] you." Right?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; But still, it'd be something wrong with
[1:40:57] them in the spirit realm. Even could be
[1:41:00] depression or whatever it is. and he
[1:41:02] called it out. That's why he said, he
[1:41:04] said, "If you got something wrong, you
[1:41:06] better put it under the blood before you
[1:41:07] get here."
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't, it's going to be
[1:41:10] exposed.
[1:41:11] [snorts]
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of spirit realm that we
[1:41:15] don't that we don't deal with that we
[1:41:17] should deal with.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; We are spiritual people.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Remember spiritual. We are spiritual
[1:41:24] people. Prophetic people.
[1:41:27] [snorts] Everybody with me?
[1:41:29] We are spiritual people.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; We are a royal priesthood.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; We are someone that God has wanted to
[1:41:38] see on this earth since eternity
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; before time.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Us.
[1:41:51] US.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; NOBODY ELSE.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; US.
[1:41:55] AMEN.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And every how we take it,
[1:42:02] [snorts]
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; you can let that thing spin around.
[1:42:06] Your soul won't die, but your spirit
[1:42:09] will
[1:42:10] cause. Cuz in your memory, reason,
[1:42:12] conscious imagination, if you let it
[1:42:13] run, and like brother Brown said, and
[1:42:15] I'm glad he said it. He said, you can go
[1:42:17] crazy and die, commit suicide, or
[1:42:20] whatever more. And he said, "Still have
[1:42:21] the Holy Ghost in your soul." Because it
[1:42:23] is two workings of the of a spirit, two
[1:42:26] spirits.
[1:42:27] You have a natural human spirit and then
[1:42:29] you got the Holy Ghost. But if you don't
[1:42:31] have the Holy Ghost, that all kind of
[1:42:32] mashes all together
[1:42:34] and you don't care.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; When you was out in the world, did you
[1:42:38] care whether God was in your soul or
[1:42:39] not?
[1:42:41] Listen, I'm not even going to say that
[1:42:44] he it was the last thing on my list. I'm
[1:42:46] going to say it wasn't even on my list.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. He wasn't on my list.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; But one day,
[1:42:58] God who is rich in mercy,
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; he said, "I know when I bring it to
[1:43:03] them, when it crosses their path, I know
[1:43:04] they'll accept it because I saw it
[1:43:06] before the foundation of the world.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; I saw them accept it." And you know what
[1:43:11] I did?
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; I brought the mom and daddy together.
[1:43:16] Sometime under circumstances that you'd
[1:43:18] go,
[1:43:19] How'd that happen? It was a God thing.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I love what he said. He
[1:43:25] said, "I don't care if your parents are
[1:43:27] drunks and prostitutes."
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "You have a chance. God brought
[1:43:31] you here for a purpose."
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; God got you here so you can make a
[1:43:36] choice.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; And he knew what choice we would make.
[1:43:39] We're not going to get anywhere. So,
[1:43:40] we'll just stop right there. We'll be on
[1:43:41] the fourth seal. Um, don't want to wear
[1:43:44] you out. But first three seals, Jesus
[1:43:46] was preaching them. Now watch
[1:43:49] because what's going to happen is and
[1:43:50] we'll read it later on. Jesus stops just
[1:43:55] like brother Ram stopped and had
[1:43:56] questions and answers.
[1:43:58] Brother Jesus, I keep want to say
[1:43:59] brother Jesus stopped right here
[1:44:03] and he started talking to current Israel
[1:44:06] right in the middle of all this because
[1:44:08] this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[1:44:10] preached in all the world for a witness
[1:44:11] unto all nations and then shall the end
[1:44:12] come when you therefore see the
[1:44:14] abomination of desolation which was a
[1:44:16] mosque of Omar they built in over in
[1:44:19] Israel sitting right on the place where
[1:44:21] Abraham sacrificed Isaac
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; or or you know was going to spoken of
[1:44:28] Daniel the prophet standing in the holy
[1:44:30] place. Whosoever readeth, let him
[1:44:32] understand. Then let them which be in
[1:44:34] Judea flee into the mountains. He's
[1:44:37] telling the people Titus is coming. In
[1:44:40] AD70, Titus surrounded the city. But the
[1:44:45] history and brother Ram tells you both
[1:44:47] there was no believer left inside the
[1:44:49] city. They listened to what Jesus said.
[1:44:51] After they got the Holy Ghost, the Holy
[1:44:53] Ghost brought back to their remembrance
[1:44:55] what the Lord told them.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Then let them which be in Judea flee
[1:44:59] into the mountains. Let them which be on
[1:45:01] the housetop not come down and take
[1:45:03] anything but get out of there.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; NEITHER LET THEM FE DON'T RETURN BACK TO
[1:45:08] TAKE YOUR COAST. GET OUT OF THERE.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And all the believers did because
[1:45:12] remember woe unto them that are with
[1:45:14] child and them give s. Do you know that
[1:45:16] they actually eat the bark off the tree?
[1:45:19] They actually killed their own babies
[1:45:21] and ate them.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; That's how desperate they got when they
[1:45:24] turned God down. They thought God was in
[1:45:26] that temple. God wasn't in that temple.
[1:45:28] God visited them in a temple of flesh
[1:45:29] and they turned him down.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Has God visited you in a temple of flesh
[1:45:33] and you turned him down? Let's stand to
[1:45:34] our feet.
[1:45:39] [applause]
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz see, then shall be great tribulation
[1:45:44] such as not since the beginning of the
[1:45:45] world. Listen, this is all temporary
[1:45:47] stuff.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But God has got to allow
[1:45:52] us to get out of here
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; to go to the Jews.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; That will completely fulfill his plan.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz it won't be the great tribulation
[1:46:03] will be after we're gone and after the
[1:46:06] 144,000 are gone. All right. I hope that
[1:46:09] helped you some because we'll go back
[1:46:11] and read continue to read Matthew 24.
[1:46:13] Just read it all the way through because
[1:46:14] you're going to see all the seals open
[1:46:16] up and then you're going to see the very
[1:46:19] last thing. The very last thing he says,
[1:46:26] the very last thing.
[1:46:31] Now learn a parable of the fig tree.
[1:46:35] That concluded his sermon.
[1:46:38] When his branch is yet tender and put
[1:46:39] forth leaves, you know that summer is
[1:46:42] nigh. Who is the fig tree? Israel.
[1:46:48] We get out of here. He goes straight to
[1:46:50] Israel. And then the seals all happen in
[1:46:55] a natural form. They take place. Boom,
[1:46:57] boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. We see it
[1:47:00] in the spiritual right now.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; We see the wild horse rider.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; We see the pale horse rider.
[1:47:08] But we see him working in a spiritual
[1:47:10] form, but he's going to start in a
[1:47:13] natural form.
[1:47:15] And we're not going to be here. The
[1:47:18] bride will not be here to see that.
[1:47:21] Let's sing a song. God bless you.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Keep falling [singing] in love with him
[1:47:31] over and over and over and over again.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; This was the love letter that God wrote
[1:47:39] to you today if you'll listen
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; over and over and over and over again.
[1:47:46] [music]
[1:47:46] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days
[1:47:51] go by. Oh, what a love
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; between my Lord. Oh my. And I just keep
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; God himself speaking to you over [music]
[1:48:00] and [singing] over and over and over
[1:48:04] again. Oh, when I first fell in love
[1:48:08] with Jesus, what'd you do? I gave him
[1:48:12] all of my heart
[1:48:15] and I thought I couldn't love him more
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; than I did at the start.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; I did right.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; But now look, but now I look back over
[1:48:24] all the mountains and valleys
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; that we've been through.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And it makes me know I love him so
[1:48:33] much more. It makes me know
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; than I did then.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; So what are we doing?
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Over and over again.
[1:48:43] I keep falling in love with him over and
[1:48:47] over and over [singing] and over again.
[1:48:52] I keep falling in love with him over and
[1:48:57] over and over and over again.
[1:49:02] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days
[1:49:06] go by.
[1:49:08] Oh, what a love between my Lord and I.
[1:49:13] [music]
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; It's a love affair.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; And it started with you saying yes,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; to the great shepherd,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; the great lamb
[1:49:24] on
[1:49:26] each valley and trial.
[1:49:30] There's a shoulder that I lean upon
[1:49:36] as I face another mind.
[1:49:39] There's a love what that I can depend
[1:49:43] on.
[1:49:45] It's fresh and new. He say
[1:49:49] [music and singing] with love in my
[1:49:51] heart is overflowing.
[1:49:54] And this is what we're going to say.
[1:49:55] Sing it to him one more time. Oh, I keep
[1:49:59] Let's thank him for what he's g us. It's
[1:50:02] Thanksgiving week. Thanksgiving one day.
[1:50:04] No, thanksgiving every day. Thank him
[1:50:07] for everything. Falling in love with him
[1:50:11] over and over and over [singing] and
[1:50:14] over again.
[1:50:17] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days
[1:50:21] go by.
[1:50:23] Oh, what a love between my Lord
[1:50:25] [singing] and I. Just keep falling in
[1:50:28] love with him over and over. Let's sing
[1:50:32] that one more time. Sing over again.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I keep falling in love with him over
[1:50:39] [singing] and over and over and over
[1:50:43] again.
[1:50:45] I keep falling in love with him over and
[1:50:49] over and over and over again.
[1:50:54] [music]
[1:50:55] get sweeter and sweeter as the days go
[1:50:58] by.
[1:51:00] Oh, what a love between my Lord and I.
[1:51:04] [music] Falling in love with him over
[1:51:07] and over and over and over again.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you honestly don't love your
[1:51:15] spouse more than you loved him when you
[1:51:17] first started, you got a problem.
[1:51:21] So, what about the perfect [music] one
[1:51:23] that we look to that we know? See, I'll
[1:51:27] make a mistake. Me and June will get in
[1:51:28] an argument, but don't get in an
[1:51:30] argument with Jesus cuz he's right and
[1:51:32] we're wrong. Whatever he says, that's
[1:51:35] what we Yeah, you going to lose. Well,
[1:51:37] you going to lose with him.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; You might you might lose with Janet,
[1:51:40] too. But you might you going to lose
[1:51:43] because she's because he's right all the
[1:51:46] time.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Not you.
[1:51:52] Good to have brother Boyd back up here.
[1:51:57] [music]
[1:52:00] But ain't that true? Look at Look at um
[1:52:03] Jeffrey and Amy. I remember when they
[1:52:05] were first kids
[1:52:07] and Oh, they were kids. Yeah. And
[1:52:12] Sterling, too. And all the ones that
[1:52:14] that that we saw come from children. And
[1:52:16] now you Amy's over there holding on to
[1:52:18] Jeffrey like he's going to fall out the
[1:52:19] window. And uh they got two kids and uh
[1:52:25] they're getting older. But if a human
[1:52:28] love can mean that much, [music] what
[1:52:30] about a love that'll never end?
[1:52:33] What about a love that'll never end? And
[1:52:35] listen, with Jesus, there's no there's
[1:52:37] no we have ups and downs and ins and
[1:52:39] out. I'm sure that um Amy wins 90% of
[1:52:42] the argument anyway. So, [music] and
[1:52:44] Jeffrey just lets her. So, but with but
[1:52:47] with God
[1:52:49] like like brother voice, he's right all
[1:52:51] the time. But do we listen to him? We
[1:52:55] must listen because listen, being
[1:52:57] prophetic people, we listen to a
[1:52:58] prophetic or a spiritual message.
[1:53:01] Doesn't have to be. Come on, people. It
[1:53:03] doesn't have to be written in the Bible
[1:53:04] verbatim,
[1:53:06] but it's to you. Brother Brown said,
[1:53:09] "What?" He said, "It's not the line."
[1:53:13] He said it's what's written between the
[1:53:15] line is the what?
[1:53:18] Love letter. He said it's got to compare
[1:53:21] with the top and the bottom. But he said
[1:53:22] in between the line is the love letter.
[1:53:27] And only you and your spouse know what
[1:53:30] that love letter is all about. Amen. And
[1:53:35] that's the same way with God. We But
[1:53:38] listen, we know who our mate is. We're
[1:53:42] Mrs. Jesus Christ. This is the
[1:53:44] prescription that he gave us.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Right. And he gave us ordinances to do
[1:53:49] the communion, the foot washing, water
[1:53:51] baptism, different things. But the most
[1:53:53] important thing is is know who you're
[1:53:56] talking to
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; and know who's talking to you because
[1:53:59] you know what I'm like, brother Dale.
[1:54:00] Brother Dale said one time, he said, "I
[1:54:02] don't know if it's the devil talking to
[1:54:03] me or God." He said, "Sometimes you
[1:54:06] think, you know, the the God would be
[1:54:07] just really sweet and nice." And he
[1:54:10] said, "No." He said, "Most time that was
[1:54:11] the devil talking to me." He said, "But
[1:54:14] that one that said, "Hey buddy, get in
[1:54:15] line." That was God. Cuz I'll promise
[1:54:18] you one thing, Satan will never point
[1:54:21] you to the true word of God.
[1:54:24] Never will he do it. He can't do it. He
[1:54:26] hates this word. He hates this like a
[1:54:28] hot poker. He don't even want to touch
[1:54:31] it. But you know what? You and I are
[1:54:34] that hot poker. We're not just heated by
[1:54:37] it. We are it. And God heats us up by
[1:54:40] the word of God.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We're going to um
[1:54:44] bow our heads just for a moment, then
[1:54:45] we'll sing sing one more song as we get
[1:54:47] ready to go and then we'll be dismissed.
[1:54:49] Remember, Brother Luis will be speaking
[1:54:51] for us Wednesday night and then next
[1:54:53] Sunday, uh we'll have our Christmas
[1:54:56] dinner. Everybody's invited. Everybody,
[1:54:59] please come because we're going to have
[1:55:02] a [clears throat] catered meal and um
[1:55:04] then we'll have um um our little get
[1:55:07] together down there at the at the uh at
[1:55:09] the venue, which is a big place, huge
[1:55:11] place, so we won't have to leave there
[1:55:13] for several hours. So, we'll go down
[1:55:15] there and enjoy ourselves. So, let's bow
[1:55:17] our heads. Dear heavenly father, thank
[1:55:18] you for this day. Thank you for the
[1:55:20] word, Lord, that you've given us.
[1:55:22] Father, I pray that you'd be with
[1:55:23] Brother Luis and Brother Aaron, all the
[1:55:25] different ones, Brother Richard, as they
[1:55:26] all come back. Lord, give brother Luis,
[1:55:28] Lord, the words of eternal life to speak
[1:55:30] to us this coming Wednesday, Lord. Lord,
[1:55:33] just be with us as we come through this
[1:55:34] Thanksgiving season. And now, here we
[1:55:37] are, Lord, a few days past it. But let
[1:55:40] let it not be that it dwindles, Lord.
[1:55:42] May we be a a a thanksgiving people that
[1:55:47] absolutely thanks you every day for the
[1:55:49] things that you give us, Lord, and the
[1:55:51] things that are coming. I pray that
[1:55:53] you'd be with each one that's sick,
[1:55:54] Lord, that's had to stay home. That
[1:55:57] you'd touch them, Lord. We've seen you,
[1:55:59] Lord. Send the word and heal them, Lord,
[1:56:01] and deliver them from the things that
[1:56:02] they have, Lord, even sitting in their
[1:56:04] home, Father. And I pray that you'd be
[1:56:06] with each one now. [music]
[1:56:08] May this word not return void, but let
[1:56:10] it accomplish
[1:56:12] everything that it's supposed to
[1:56:13] accomplish. Lord, we ask these things in
[1:56:16] Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing a song
[1:56:18] before we go. Sing it. Go ahead. My
[1:56:21] heart
[1:56:23] floods of joy or my soul [singing]
[1:56:26] when the sea builders roast
[1:56:30] Jesus [singing] came into my heart.
[1:56:35] Since Jesus came into my heart.
[1:56:39] [singing]
[1:56:40] Oh, since Jesus [music] came into my
[1:56:44] heart.
[1:56:47] What a joy that's possible [music]
[1:56:51] wrong since Jesus came into my heart.
