========================================

we're going to read this uh scripture can anybody see that okay now yes even you older ones in the back joints even you real owen huh any hearing all right so let's read this as the prophet reads it and you can read it along with me instead of just reading it but we were studying last sunday on the statue of a perfect man beginning at the at the first part where it's not to the world it's not too um just nominal christians this is to the bride this is to the elect this is to the ones hey buddy this is to the ones that are in christ jesus because that's what peter said simon peter and servant apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith so what do we got to do before we even start up the statue of a perfect man yeah be born again all right so you got to be born again that's the requirement because you can have some of these virtues and just be as black as soot uh judas had a percentage of these virtues because he was with the twelve but he showed his colors after a while and you know you know what he did so let's read this like the prophet reads it so now let us read now first peter ii peter rather the first chapter of portion of it simon peter servant apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god in our savior jesus christ i like the way that stated right there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith that's what we're talking about faith is the biggest part of the pyramid it's the foundation that we start with right i like the way that stated see let me read that again listen close simon peter servant apostle jesus christ to them that obtain obtain black precious faith through the righteousness of god our savior in jesus christ notice he is saying that i have obtained this faith am i and i am addressing this to them that have obtained the like precious faith all right so he's talking to certain good people he's not talking to sinners he's talking to a group of people all right called the bride okay i have obtained this faith and i'm addressing this to them that has obtained like precious faith i want it's not to the outside world all right not to the outside world this is to the church see those that are in christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and through of jesus christ our lord and i'm reading it like he's reading it for anybody's on the internet that can't see that i'm reading it as the prophet's reading it not as as totally as the bible but i want to get his comments in there grace and peace be multiplying to you through the knowledge of god and through of jesus christ our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things his divine power now has given unto us all things that pertain to life godliness to the knowledge of him that's called us to glory and virtue whereby we are given unto given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature now let that soak in real deep now not preaching this morning we're just teaching this lesson divine nature let me read that fourth verse again so you won't miss it whereby we are given whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust see there's a promise you've escaped the world the lust of the world and that's exactly what we're going to be looking at we don't like to call it that just like the other day we didn't like to call things and time but remember this is antichrist sorry this was born against christ this is not the way christ wanted this to come so it's anti it's anti-word we were not born according to the word jesus was born according to the word that's why he was who he was we were not born according to the word we were born anti-word all right and we have to be that's why we have to escape this we have a way of escape let's don't leave it hanging that we're anti-word and will always be anti-word no there's a way back there's a way to get out of that all right and it's true that we escape the world through the lust of the world as the bible says well this that's what's happening here you you still got you've got faith at the new birth all right and then it says add to your faith in other words what i said the other day add to what you believe because you can't add to something you don't believe in right you gotta you gotta come to faith that's why brother brown said this whole thing is based on faith you've got to believe that god's going to do that for you you got to believe that he's made a way to do that for you okay and he's made the way because remember and we were talking a little bit in the minister's meeting yesterday that ephesians 1 says we've obtained an inheritance well we didn't get an inheritance down here we got our inheritance before the foundation of the world if we believe that we're predestinated jesus come to make a way for us to get out of this anti right word yes birth yes to be born again not of corruptible seed which is what your mom and daddy brought sorry corruptable can't be god that's right all right so we were born in corruption but we're going to be raised in incorruption or be changed and we're not going to be changed unless we have all these virtues working in our life plus the headstone or the seals coming to show us that this guy right here is righteous what are you if you're born again you're god in human flesh that's right but you got to believe that your mind's got to be changed to the mind of christ because you are god man manifest in another form if you have the new birth you're god in him flesh so it's not that god's got a problem living in human flesh he does not the problem is is us that's right he's perfect trying to work on something in person right and he's not trying he is that's right he is working on and that's what the whole song he's still working on me to make me what i ought to be okay but we got to realize that we just don't come into the message and then we just get born again and then we just sit there yeah you're born into the kingdom but you're just like the prodigal son remember the prodigal son wasn't a bastard child he was a son he wasn't lost come on now he wasn't he was a son he backslid went away from the promise of god or the promise of his father right but he was a son and because he was a son he come back because god called him back we see that's an allegory or a a type so so let's see that that even as born-again christians we do things wrong we we we do live in a world of of lust of this thing and lust of that thing doesn't have to be just lust of what first thing comes to your mind but we can have lust for other things and god wants to cut that away because we do we live in this earthly flesh and it's always going to be earthy until we're changed or as we were preaching the other day about the purging you're either going to be purged too one or two ways you're going to die and resurrect and that purges you from your old man right or you're going to be changed in the moment in 2011 on this side but this is going to change this thing before it goes like brother branham always says and claude brought her to my attention long time ago now it's always stuck with me because he said this thing is going to be sticky right to the change and it is you're going to have to fight this thing right here i was sister tudy gave me a book on the journey of israel how israel got started way back i'm talking about way back and even in david's time well he breaks down david's era and it's and it's true because of what david did god said you'll fight your way so for 40 years david fought battle after battle but now he was victorious but he still had to fight now watch joshua the first time he gets into the kingdom god said here's your promised land it's flowing with milk and honey what's the first thing you've done you have to start fighting people so this is a battle the bible says that the kingdom is is is obtained by force we have to obtain this by force not just get born again and say that's it no once you get born again you just are able to begin to fight there's no fight when you're not born again remember there was no white dog black dog when when the black dog was one it was ruined but once you get the two in there right they're fighting back and forth and which one we feed the most that's the one that wins right but we have a way out that's right we have a way of escape we have a way to get out of all this all right but it's going up the statue of perfect man it's not just saying i'm in the message and i sit in a message church you said they're all you can sit in the church for 30 years 40 years 50 years 100 years and still don't go to heaven that's right or are you going to die and go by the grave and somebody's going to have to resurrect you but somebody's going to come and you say well i can't do this well you just stopped yourself if you say i can't do it then you might as well just quit because you can't but you just got to keep struggling keep fighting like like that like i said about david and i believe that's why that that the member of the bible promises that in the millennium that the son of david was set on the throne for solomon was the son of david he was prosperous he didn't fight wars that all was done by his daddy to acquire all this land and not he had to fight all these people and even in that book did you read that book where he said even that david now remember he killed goliath which was a philistine and they almost wiped that army out but you see him about 10 years later the philistines are helping him get back into into judea so he he was a real he was a diplomat he could get you to do things and that was the anointing that david had he had that anointing he could get people the people that he destroyed he got him to help him but see that's what david was he was the type of christ and that's the same way um but that's why he got a promise that in the millennium the son of david is going to sit on the throne ruling peacefully for a thousand years okay it's not gonna be david sitting there but it's the type showing that david fought for every inch you and i are gonna fight right up to the time we get out of here but once we get in the millennium we'll see it's not the millennium's not even to us it's to the jews because we're going to sit with him in the temple and rule for a thousand years right we're going to be the queen he's the king the jews are good at 144 000 is going to be the units the temple eunuch and then there's going to be tribes remember dad preaching on this there's tribes going to be out there in the millennium it's not just going to be us because it is to israel the millennium is the israel we're just there on a honeymoon and i found out something about since we're starting to to uh have honeybees you know where the warren honeymoon came from where did the word honeymoon come from thank you sister ginger you see what i have to put up with i know but anyway yeah y'all put up with it too i'm sure the word honeymoon has nothing to do with your honey sorry honeymoon back in the like the whatever century it was before that it was just the consummation of the wedding it was the honeymoon it wasn't called honeymoon so back a couple of thousand years ago this was before even christ they would take honey and ferment it and make mead liquor wine make honey wine and you can make honey wine they told us if it was too much if it was too much moisture that would turn into wine and you'd have honey wine so they would make honey wine honey wine in the olden days and they would give it to the husband and wife when they got married and they would drink it for a month from one moon to the other moon for conception purposes and it helped them have a boy and not a girl therefore it was called a honey moon there's where the word honeymoon comes from so see there you learned something today you might not learn another thing about the statue of a furby man but you sure know education class last sunday so we might as well end it up with a honeymoon there's a lot of things you can do with honey no let's talk about the uh the world we've escaped the world now look what brother brown says in paragraph 37 see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is god's requirement so this is a requirement these virtues are a requirement it's not something that just fills up space in the bible but realize one thing for sure we're in the end time with the fullness of the word they didn't have the fullness of the word in the first church age but they had all these virtues the prophet said working in their life see how short we are yeah see women want to be real revelation get all the seals and everything but we can't live a good christian life do the right things say the right thing be the right example they were the right example and then god could seal it with that holy spirit up here not not the holy ghost you receive down here it's not two different holy ghosts but it's more we'll get to later on where brother brown said that holy spirit up there on the top of that pyramid it seals all these virtues in because see you can have the new birth here and go all the way up here and not make it to say patience or temperance well that's as far as you go as far as you go but you're not going to reach perfection that's right okay yeah you're there is perfection you got to go that's why i said look it says it's not man's requirement it's not the prophet's requirement it says what is god's requirement so it's required that these virtues work in our life all right that's why the ephesian church was a powerful church a huge huge church 12 people there was 12 people in a room and they were a powerful church why they had all the virtues working in their life were they sticky until they died surely they were sure they were yeah they were sticking up but they weren't as sticky as they used to be no that's the best thing to say is you're not as sticky as you used to be okay but these are requirements everybody understand these are required they're not just something we're going through just to be going through for the 25th time it says this what is god's requirement there's not a person in here that loves god but wants to become more like christ now it's laid out here every christian i'm an old veteran look at brother and sister kid here they're probably the oldest in the building if i'd ask them what is your heart's desire it'd be closer to god when you learn of christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into him and then he expresses that by his wife saying that he loved her so much he wanted to just pull her inside of him but you can't do that but christ can do it to us he can be that husband that loves his wife so much and he does and he does protect us from the world let's feed this right here i want to read this right here very good 45. that's the way it is with christ see we've got to be so in love with him to when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit so as we go through this study say god i want virtue i won't verse you i won't verse you and then you're still the same we're gonna do quit and say god why are you no you just keep going you just keep going keep going when he says no in other words like i told you god's nose are the best guesses you'll ever get because you may be wanting to obtain virtue this way just use it for an example you may be wanting to find say well god i need virtue so i'm going to do this but god's way's over here and you're over here beating your head against the wall god's saying no that's not right so try something else he said that's so simple well brother branham said if you were stingy what'd he say give money away if you were stubborn start giving stuff what he said do the vice versa so if you're if you're if you're mean and if you're mean to your wife or if you're mean to your husband that's wrong quit doing that just quit doing it do the vice versa quit being mean to each other and i'm talking about meaning about having fusses and fights and arguments i'm talking about being just mean to people you just being mean ain't got nothing to do with this statue of a perfect man it really doesn't have anything to do with the lord just don't be mean don't be spiteful we already went through all that but look see why and the only way we can do that is become partakers of his divine nature so the only way we're going to ever get right is to be born again the only way we're ever going to get right is to be born again then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you partakers of his divine nature and look here having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust escaped it see who it's to is to the church them who are in christ has been exalted above these things not he exalting himself because you're going to try your best to get up here and then one day you're going to fall but if he takes you up there that's right and like we were talking about in the sunday school class it's a birth virtue is a birth because it's something you're contrary to you're contrary you contrary to all these virtues or you wouldn't need them right okay you're contrary to them so you're contrary to them you need these virtues so god's going to help you through them but you can't do it yourself and it be godly you can try your best but still somewhere down the line it's like daddy was talking about you know the example of talking about somebody slapping him said he don't think he could ever take anybody slapping him well somebody at general motors 20 something years ago slapped him and he saw it was gone he that the anger didn't raise up the you know i'm gonna hit you back or i'm gonna get you back no it was gone so once it's gone then you say thank you god and you can lock that in and you can have what faith you don't stop having faith down here right now remember one more time these lines are just lines of separating each word actually there's no line this is the way it ought to be right here and right faith right virtue and all these temperaments patience god in this brother kindness because you're going to need it all the way up and you're going to get a percentage of of brotherly kindness because you know what when you get born again you're going to start loving the people that love you first that's right all right then you've got to start loving the people that don't love you right that's the development is to love the people that don't even like you at all there are even people you don't want to be around yeah yeah all right so same thing with knowledge god when he burst you into the body of christ the first thing god started doing for me was he started putting the word together i heard the words when i was 14 years old in this church is that here god was 14 15 16 17 18 years old i read the books listened to the tapes knew what the prophet said i knew the white horse writer was the antichrist but you know why that antichrist was right here he had not ridden away from my revelation because i didn't have one all i had was was the ability to read and i think that's our problem we just get the ability to read come on that's right are we still doing here for 50 years the prophet brought the pure word of god why are we still here because we're just reading it like a reading room right and then like brother brown said he said you don't need a revelation to see what baptism in the name of jesus christ it's right there playing in the book but it does take a revelation to see it to really see it that's right so when i came back to the lord the first thing the lord started doing was was quickening what i had heard is that what the bible says quicken what you heard and teach you things to come in other words revelation he taught me revelation he taught me the serpent seed wasn't just sex in the garden he'd come all the way from the mind of eve all the way down to here and then we got to go back to destroy that okay of course not just that he didn't eat an apple see i think we use that a lot of times when we go we know something you don't know well that's not right to be that way because it says right here not he exalted himself but christ brought him up all right everybody got that christ has got to do it so it's not just not what you do you say well you just told us to do the vice versa that's for you to start with you got to start somewhere if you're stubborn and continue to be stubborn god can't deal with you but if you say god i'm tired of being stubborn i'm tired of being stubborn then he can start working on you we'll just turn around and quit being stubborn for a little while try it yourself this is not this is not reformation this is not alcohol it's anonymous where they suppress your feelings so that you're once an alcoholic always an alcoholic no you get born again all that goes away right all right truly born again right all that'll go away now you know i said truly born again all right now let's read right here look at paragraph 49 now remember this was the old color sister says i ain't what i want to be ain't what i ought to be ain't what i want to be but ain't what it used to be like what brother ryan says that's how we know we pass from death into life see we've got to know that church we can sit here and we can go through this and it's just a good sunday school class and it'll give you a feel good if you want to and it'll condemn you if you want to but you got to be you gotta pass from death unto life to even start understanding all right we look back to the pit where we was huge from see we're not what we want to be we're not even what we ought to be but one thing we're thankful for we're not what we used to be that's right he says look we're on the road haven't made it yet but we are on the right road like daddy said remember if we got a ticket to get on the bus and we go to the airport that ticket doesn't do you any good unless you're standing where the bus is going to be that's right right so we got to be where the bus is going to be listen and having escaped the corruption of the world having escaped that the lust and corruption of the world you're above that now that's now that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that has escaped these things see the corruption of the world and besides this giving all diligence add unto your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance tempers patience peace of god and this godless brother carlos brotherly kindness charity it says now he has given us the outline here what to do know how to do it now as i said we're all trying to come closer to god that's why i chose this message this morning for the church knowing that people are traveling but last night i said how many is here and he's talking about from out of town people but there's no great anthem some pretended to be angelic choir some stained glass you have a hard time getting a seat on a bench and standing around the wall they don't come for such as that but they come because the inside of them is something that sees a beauty that's a natural eye doesn't see it's a spiritual eye that catches the beauty of christ that's why they're here and that's why we're here that's why we're here we're here to learn about god learn about what he's done for us and he even talks about here about how this came you come back two times two equal four but but look what he says in paragraph 54. here's the key right here yield yourself and after a while you'll break away from yourself you say oh that's for a profit is it how many times do we truly yield ourselves to god come on how many times do we just say god i'm in a i'm in a corner i'm sure some of you have i mean i'm sure but we haven't as much as we should no that's right we should yield right you say well this is layout of sin we got all this and we got all that and it's true we got all these we got all these things now that's uh conveniences and we still can't find time to serve god um johnny charles wesley's mother 17 children could you imagine washing clothes for 17 kids and she spent two hours a day teaching them about god two hours a day no we have to do this and we go do that and i can name i can put it on a list but you know what you got your own list you should know whether you're not doing right that's what we were talking about last night or yesterday in the in the uh ministers meeting we were talking about the three comings of of god in the end time but we truly got to realize that god has come in the end time and he's he's here to deal with the things that he didn't leave us in lao to see and say wow you all just do what the best you can you know no he told some of the other ages do the best you can remember he told them in the fourth age you got just a little bit of light you're barely just going to barely make it why they were killed remember 68 million christians were killed during the dark ages of the time of of columba there in thyatira church age they could just barely make it through just say you're a christian they'll kill you they didn't have to worry with virtue knowledge temperance patience sure they had those things working in their life but they were required for their age but this age is required statue of a perfect man and onto the headstone because here's the real message of the hour so everything's got to be moving up toward that is to the headstone brother brown didn't come bring us another message or another god he restored the faith remember faith of the father's to the children right but he's restoring the what faith what we lost faith in the word you go talk to somebody in the baptist church or methodist church and all places like that talk to them and see what kind of hope they have well i hope i'm safe well i hope we're going to make it well i hope this president's going to do this i hope the pope's going to do it it's all a hope that we're just we're just hoping they have no road map brother brown said you got a road map you're on the road now so we got to get on the right road and it's like a brother was saying last night this is kind of a cooling off time you don't hear many people getting saved you don't hear many people getting baptized i mean it's a big thing to hear one person getting baptized in this church where we used to baptize five or six when i first started coming in 98 99 in there i was one of them but now we baptize maybe one or two maybe three a year right it's a cooling off time everything's kind of cooled off but even during that cooling off time let's go back to the honeybees in the wintertime they're worthless they don't produce anything but they're getting that hive ready for the spring they're inside working they're not they're not relaxing they're in there working you can't see a lot of activity going on because it's inside am i making a point here you don't see a lot going on but on the inside something's working then all of a sudden when the environment is right they've got the comb ready they've got the little bitty worker bees that are in their little larvas and when they hatch they go to work and all the worker bees are women that's right praise the lord your sister say hallelujah and i'm not going to tell you what she does to the male bee when she gets finished with him so it's kind of not good for the men let's just put it this way he dies i may expound on yielding yourself and i stand to be corrected you know that but we have to yield ourselves but we have to grow with our yields that's correct you can't just say i'm going to yield myself right no you have to grow every day you have to grow you know eat women for me example i'm yielding myself more and more i'll give them a whole day whatever you have to do if you have to do laundry don't bring the cell phone right think about him when you're doing your laundry think about him when you're doing your cooking your healing should be growing insane yeah and that's a good point because look there are nuns nuns in uns nuns in convents now are you talking about yielding yourself and they're just as black as said inside yeah they're not born again if they take that catholic doctrine but they yield themselves to that idea that the catholic church is going to save them because of the penance they do that's why martin luther was so important he said it's not that it's not works it's faith the just shall live by faith right there foundation the just shall live by faith that's put that put luther in the body of christ now he didn't have to work on virtue knowledge tempers patience sure god worked on him in a degree but he still sat in a pub and drank beer and smoked a pipe he didn't see that the other things of god were were to clean up your life he just said the just shall live by faith and that's exactly what happened during that time the just lived by what the faith of god not the faith in the catholic church or the faith in the penance because martin luther himself would drag himself across rocks lay prostate for hours praying with his face in a rock what trying to do penance then when that revelation came he didn't do that no more he gets up cleans himself off and yeah he does go to a pub and start drinking beer and smoking a cigar and talking about god but it was the just shall live by faith come out of that system of course he was a reformer not a restorer he began the act of restoration but he was a reformer so he could just reform him to a certain spot okay wesley could reform to a certain spot right but then we come with the full restoration of the word and it's restored it back restore back to the faith of the fathers all right and then go on to the headstone because it's required in this age so these are not just something we want to do it's something we are required to do all right so now one more thing before we go now let's just stop right there we'll read something else next week if you got the statue of a perfect man book or if you can look at it online like this read what he says about faith but that's what we're going to start on next sunday is faith
