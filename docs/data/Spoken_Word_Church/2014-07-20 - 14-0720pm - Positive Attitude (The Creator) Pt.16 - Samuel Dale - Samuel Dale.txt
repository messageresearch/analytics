want to see you amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you testimony to give and while he's coming you're sitting down I'll go ahead with the Brother Gary sister Rebecca called and said that he was having a lot of trouble come having trouble breathing so for us to pray call an ambulance and take him to the hospital tell him I said it you know take him there and let him check him out you know and sister Regina she uh has been real sick and I also just remember that and remember also now we'll be having a baptismal service at the end of the service so we'll go right on down to teren say for the for the baptismal service come on brother the day I'd like to give a testimony of what God's did for me uh I guess most of you don't know it but the last couple of years the heart doctor told me that uh my top of my heart the artist was open but the bottom of it where they got all little spider veins they were closing down but uh I had to went to the heart doctor Monday and he wanted to do a heart cath on me Tuesday and uh they uh it was a the doctor that was that been treat me all these years he had to do something else and they got some more doctors in the office and U so they scar you one of the others to do this and I didn't know him i' never seen him and so we got there it was 4 of us from this from these doctors that would had to have heart cats and there was I don't know how many other doctors was there but it went on for a little while and they come in there and told me says U we're going to have to put everything on hold because he had a patient out same marage that had a heart attack and he had to go attend to him so meanwhile we was there didn't know how long we'd be there and uh Peggy had called the U the office where we know the the lady there that runs the show over there real well and she told here about me being having sugar and all that stuff and uh it wasn't about you can correct me if I'm wrong about 30 minutes he called back out there it was another doctor says uh well I come out hip out in 30 30 40 minutes I was back in the back and I stayed back there probably two and 1 half hours if anybody's ever had one of those things they know it don't last for about 45 minutes or something even if I have to put stance in him but uh I was uh they giving a shot and I was awake the whole time I watched him do all that stuff and he told Peggy let me get this out of the way that doctor said it was nothing else he could do for me okay but I said well I know somebody I know somebody I never give up I don't give up I don't know how to give up God said with his stes we're healed and and I'm standing right there on that one so he come out and he says I don't know why that doctor said that says you bother me your heart this is pure and I mean the veins are open he said I have no idea why he said that right I want you to know God's still alive I've been through a lot but God's brought me through them all I don't know why I have no idea but I know who's a Potter and who's a clay every many times he has to break me down as long as he brings me to where he wants me I'm going to be I just want you to know God still lives if you got a problem hang on right he's on his way that's right bless you exactly exactly amen just hang on because that's the point he's trying you let's stand like turning your scriptures turn to Hebrews 11 where we've been reading and then we'll go to Psalms 102 Hebrews 11 and Psalms 102 remember to pray for these that are sick and just keep praying you know you say well my prayer doesn't mean very much that's why I like for everybody here to have contact and whatever to do you know because you don't know who's going to touch God what it matter who touches him long as somebody touches them and and God comes on the scene right Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day and your grace your guidance thank you for you thank you for the testimony our brother gave Lord and we believe it we believe your word is true and forever settled in heaven we believe that Brother Gary is all right Lord we just pray that you touch him be with him Lord help him and sister Regina Lord is is doing going to be fine and even brother our brother Boyd we know that he's having a lot of trouble with pneumonia but we know who the one is that can take care of all things so we just ask you to touch and guide the other sicknesses Among Us Lord come down and deliver and set free as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts because that's what we desire more than anything else we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and make us worthy to be able to even stand in in the congregation of the righteous to where that we could be the people of God have your way we love you father thank you in Jesus name amen remember Sister Mary too she was still having some problems Sister Mary Dy and uh they haven't heard yet I don't know where they ran the test on her got remember they said she having a lot of hurt in her chest and they put her through or was going to put her through this past week I didn't get the really answer to whether they did or not but uh you know pray that everything will be all right she was still she had had some troubles last night and we believe and Lord will take care of it all right Hebrews 11 now Faith is the substance of things hop for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it dealers obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear all right now let's go over to Psalms 102 and we'll just read verse 18- 20 read it all when you get a chance but it's good says this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord now think of that for them that are created all right CU we believe in a new creation right for he that looked down from the heights of his Sanctuary now listen for he hath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of his word now some of said they really enjoyed our uh what what is it uh it's not geography but talking about this morning of the the things that you know life and beings and how the world and all and remember we went through showing that how in Genesis 1 it says the Heaven and the Earth was created and it stopped there so it could have been billions of years before anything ever took place that's why science can use that to look and and study it and like I said they pick up a bone they take the bone in and when they try to analyze the bone they're analyzing the dirts and the things around it and they're getting a carbon content uh out of that and they saying that bone is millions of years old and uh but we don't believe it that way believe we believe that uh you know the uh creation is in six days and uh the world wasn't created on the first day it was created and then he stopped you know and then the creation started and you know what I love about this message it has the answers if we just search it out uh the prophet said even those dinosaurs they would talk about you know the big Fellers running around so they was running around the Garden of Eden but with no harm well we don't deny all of the those things we believe that but now brother brandom I'll get to it in a second but he didn't I looked it up to make sure cuz I'm always saying this and a lot of people say well brother R said it when uh somebody come up and run it up real quick so he didn't say that well brother randam didn't say the word Big Bang Theory it's not in the in the quotes he didn't use it that way I'll read you in a minute what he said all right but if you remember what we were trying to bring out that the heavens and the Earth were created the Heaven and the Earth and it was in a singular form there because that would be the beginning and be what and any anything else would come from that all right then as it would be that God would allow a great uh Atomic thing to happen and send out it become a uh you know a burning mass and doing the things but then when Paul would pick it up he'd say the worlds were framed all right which means out in space then there's all kind of planets and stars and things you know that you could call worlds and universes and and things that would uh would be there and then that way we don't deny those things we we just believe it but see then Paul was taking it on into a greater form form because he was declaring that uh you know God started it but he created it and he says through faith we understand we then we are first now like as I said this morning the first thing to Psalms is to deal with the creation he didn't start out talking about Abel's great faith he started out talking about true Faith are telling you what faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence Things Not Seen and then he went down to it says true faith our our faith we understand it doesn't say science understands it says we understand we as illiterate people compared to the religious Society can read the word of God and believe it and see that it's very simple how that God created the things and how they were made and and all like that and coming down and then it would come to that point that to where you know it would not stop because our where we've locked our minds to a thought and we'll even quote the prophet you know that that it was a finished physical creation all right we believe that I mean I don't think he's creating more worlds I think it was finished you know Universe was finished stars planets moons whatever you want to call them were finished and that it would be a uh a situation then that whatever would come into being after then would come from that or that same source and as I said then ending up talking about it Jesus could take fish and multiply them right that was coming out of the dirt but then he would say that if you say to this mountain be moved and doubt not in your heart it it be all right then he comes down to us because he placed a little something in there we'll get just a minute in in our reading that he placed a little point in there to show us that it wasn't done but now understand what I'm saying he's not creating more worlds we don't need more worlds all right but he hasn't stopped creating that's our Point we've narrowed that down and think we understand and then when we do we look at it and we don't follow it that here's Moses as the Lord Jesus could take the fish and multiply and fine that's wonderful but see Moses had already said let there be flies fleas frogs now I've told you my honest opinion there I think there were already flies fleas and frogs because they were there in original creation when it was made in Genesis but they was just bringing to being in that area a whole lot more more of them all right and putting them into that place not it was just bringing them in because you would be going back and making some other um creation that was not made in the original creation and I believe all things was made there except the mule I was looking at that the other day brother around said God didn't make the mule he says man made that so good point but thinking about it and see he didn't stop creating he really just started because I said Moses was not greater than the Lord Jesus but Moses could speak flies fleas and frogs into existence all right and here would come the Lord Jesus and you know what he done we'll get to this later in the message brother R talking about it when he says you know receive you the Holy Ghost he breathed on them he said that Holy Ghost didn't come right to them it said it come on to that Pentecost you know what the Lord Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God and we are the continuation of that creation so then he didn't stop all right so watch that in just a second go we start off looking at it as what all things were made created framed formed whatever words you're using was made by the word of God and God spoke it into being by saying let there be and that product or whatever you want to call it came into being all right and and as it came into being it came from an original substance all right and I believe those flies fleas and frogs you know God didn't have to reach down and get the dirt and pull it up and do the things he might have even done that through Moses I don't know but he didn't have to because he he could go back to the original and create so if there's anything coming if we get a limb if we get as we covered right at the end brother R say he believe the limbs would be restored uh and he we talked about the eyesight the I mean the eyes being brought back the different things if those things done without going to the dirt and picking them up then we know for one thing ass sure it didn't come from another planet but it came from the original source that brought this Earth planet World etc etc into being all right from the original source so we're not trying to mold together something and they fly away that's your book of mccabes but we're trying to get back to the spoken word being the Original Seed all right and then I believe that the bride in the end time I believe she down through time has spoken the word but it's going to come into a greater thing and more into our day and our time because we're ending up of all things and I believe you had to speak you remember Wednesday you had to speak your salvation go that's the Bible believe in your heart confess with your mouth all right I believe healing believe in your heart confess in your mouth leave the head out of it all right try to bypass that old thing if you can because we know we can't but you know my point if we could bypass the head it wouldn't be a lot of hindrance the head was where Satan entered there in in the garden to stop up the flu to mess up Eve in the garden was through the head coming down to the memories the reason and conscience all right but now you understand what I mean then the it will say Heaven and Earth but then it says worlds were created brother Brown said if God didn't stop us that we had enough ability within us to create a world and go live on it well I think it evidently must have been possible or he wouldn't have said it all right but just think about it now what we want to do this afternoon is to get down to the Creator part because that was where uh the message was to go to this morning but then if we can see who the Creator is right and then we can see where he's at are you with me and see maybe we'll get away from looking back Yonder or Over Yonder and maybe we'll get a positive attitude about our thinking and think about where he is now and then maybe we can see the possibilities of great things that could take place if we believe it all right so that's the thought of the message now all right so we know then that we start with brother randam and speaking on a message called uh Jesus only authority of the word 1954 excuse me wait a minute we got to pick up these others 3A uh let me read these where you won't think that I'm messing up on something brother brandom as I said I go to threea which is Choice the father brother BR never used the Big Bang Theory you know as we use the word all right so this somebody you know saying well no that's not well then okay let's read him choice of Father under satisfied and look at him back there there he was standing there then after he got the then this after the clinkers went off and the stars and the meteorites were made he's talking about something happened we're get another quote something happened causing those clinkers to come off right I can see this logos go over and hang over this Earth brood over it bring it back here around this sun and begin to break up the ice around it the great big icebergs begin to come down Texas in Oklahoma was formed she run into the Gulf of Mexico down there he was making the ditches and the Plains and whatever he made vegetation and things would come up after a while and after it all got meteored it got melted and the ice run out and made water now we're in Genesis 1 okay now you in Genesis 1 you can take it from right there Genesis 1 it was without form and void and the spirit of God moved upon the waters is that right in the beginning and he separated the water brought up the vegetation and everything okay go to the next one questions and answers 19 and 53 three paragraph or yeah paragraph 2 32 now back there then when this little Halo comes and then we can't see nothing yet but yet but just by eyes of just Supernatural we see a Halo standing there now that's the Son of God logos now I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity see and now then in his imaginary makeup he begin to think of what things would be and I can hear him say let there be light and when he did an Adam bursted and the sun came into existence he world for hundreds of millions of years forming clinkers and burning and forming like it is today still burning still breaking atoms I just I gave that this morning and I thought well somebody argue about where and I said it's still going on the universe is moving or whatever the things would be so you know and I looked it up to make sure brother brother didn't say the Big Bang but that's what he's talking about right okay but it started from some great big happening all right bypass number four Jesus The Authority say oh God who made heavens and earth created All Things by Jesus Christ not Jesus the body no Jesus the Christ now who is that Jesus the Christ according to the Bible one day he asked a question who do Man say I the son of man am well you're this you're that or the other who do you say that I am Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God all right Peter might not have fully understood the thing that he said but he said it perfectly right because he was the creator of God what about the Creator God standing in a part of his own creation he wouldn't three through creating back there and come on we're going to John 1 right go ahead and pull it up but while you're going there verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so that means almighty God himself not another the Creator came to Earth all right and he created according to Hebrews 10:5 a body thou has prepared me so he created his own body there's where I love the understanding from the prophet of the Virgin birth because the best we could do of mankind believes that Mary produced The Egg and God produced The Germ sperm whatever and we don't believe that because that would have been sinful man right that would have been the old creation trying to bring a new creation cuz she was part of the old creation right right so it would not be that it would be the new creation you said yeah but he's only only the New Creation in the spiritual there's where you're messing up going run all you quotes in the prophet's message of the beginning of the creation of God and see if the biggest percentage of them doesn't relate to the Virgin birth and then Mary was produced at do you understand what I'm saying if Mary would have produced the egg it would have been the old system bringing forth part which was not possible he created egg and sperm you say where from from the original creation where did Moses get the fleas and the flogs from the original creation where did Brother random get the squirrels from the original creation where is Lim's things going to be restored you think we're going up in a Rapture with a lag missing you know hold on till I get my wheelchair lined up not exactly all right so it's going to be a creation time that we thought was over right until you heard of this message did you know anything about even the Virgin birth hardly other than argumented forms but did you think about it that if Mary brought that that would be that old creation which is dirty polluted I hate to think about it but she had to be virgin mind and virgin wound to be able to even bring forth as she did and God had to Barry that to use it and connected to the body or what do you want to call it of Jesus to her physically the word that the food the uh minerals Etc would come through Mary but not to create no virgin birth all right now then think of what it says about this Jesus Christ that we talk about art the Christ the son of the Living God th AR the Creator because the best they can do back there in in h Genesis or the writing is to talk about a Son of God and the Son of God being creating all things because that would have to be true to match up I remember the prophet would emphasize he said think the Creator God lived in human flesh but he didn't stop he said think that Creator God by the new birth now lives in you we don't have to call the Creator down he's not up in heaven we we got to get him down or down we got to get him up the Bible plainly tells us that he's in thee even n thee in thy mouth the word of faith that we preach right think about the Creator living inside of you would there be any problem then to think about how he could create again oh no that's not for us that's only for brother brandham and the Lord Jesus well I just don't agree with that and the reason I don't agree with that because that would be putting part of God in you but not all of God In You by the new birth and what would that make you and make you a demon god because that would make him a demon god if he didn't have all of it a demon god is a secondary God Dema every how you spell it a demon god is a secondary God it is not the original God and that's what the Trinity is if you make him another person beside the person of almighty God then you're making him a Dema God and that's what they developed at n of Rome that he was not the substance he was a like substance there's where your Trinity come from took hundreds of years to get it into being you think we going to preach it out in two sermons no 40 something years I've been screaming and hollering about that to my own self I guess because see I want to see it don't you no but think about it now Jesus the Christ not the man body you know Jesus cuz his name was Jesus I come in my father's name well his father's name was Jesus or he had another name see then the name of God is what Jesus oh you're just a Oneness I beg your pardon I am Oneness in the bases of the true Oneness because I believe in Oneness but not in the concept of organized religion and the Oneness that he's one like your finger and that Jesus was the lastest form of God I don't agree with that I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ in the Gentile dispensation is the LI form of God I believe that then why don't we believe that that Creator God is living within us we see we've got him cut off you remember what we were using the other day about faith was not being taught correctly and he said let's wake up that faith wake it up in you and I let's try to get those dimensional things straightened out to where we can walk in God and see him alive all right let's go to John 1 one then and just start there because most of you know by heart the scriptures I give you I got one more I found but we'll you know we keep finding little things in the word so John 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God see we want to take that with like somebody standing beside of you know with somebody standing beside of means you're with somebody but think about word and spirit think about father father and son when year would stand a man on Earth and he would say I and my father are one so then it was either God or a deceiver so it's not the word with is not the point of somebody with but it is very beautiful if you look at it correctly because you put word and spirit together you got God you put word and spirit today together today you got God right you bring the word alive you got God but see we don't read that other part in the beginning was the word the word was with God see there we don't read the other and the word was so the width can't be signifying to people because you have to change the light's part of the verse and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God watch all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now this word this Scholar's terms of logos speech Son of God the one true and living God not a trinity neither a you know it's not a father passing down the word to the son or the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost passing it down to the sun go out and speak brother Bron says we see a little Halo go out he said in logos ter in what terms that's the word logos he said it means Son of God and that was the one that said let there be cuz he's changing from visible I mean pH invisible to visible not able to see or comprehend to be able to see and comprehend and that's what God done haven't you heard great sermons preached by people that God sent his own son he searched through heaven and he couldn't find nobody and finally the son walked up and they said Daddy Let Me Go you ain't never listen to them did you sleep then like you do now but think about it see because that's not the only scriptures most of you know all the scriptures by heart but go to the next Ephesians 1:3 tells you specifically of a great mystery Ephesians 3:9 to make all men see what is the great what is the fellowship with a mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ Paul had no problem defining who he was as a matter of fact all of the writings except John is mentioned but John about the Creator and then Paul puts about three in and then Revelations brings in one all right but you see all things were created by Him we read in John now we've defined who is the creator Jesus Christ so now go to Colossians one by for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones dominions or principalities or Powers so that pretty well covers everything right all things were created by Him and for him now hold that point and he is before all things and by him all things consist he not only brought it but he brought it for a purpose and we're still consisting or existing by the word you know the word spoke one time and the Sun keeps rising and set right you don't have to go out every day and tell the moon to come up and go down or whatever his word spoke it and it's perfectly in harmony with everything but remember it was created by Him and for him God had a reason to bring the world into being now I do believe that these bodies were taken out of the world right I believe God molded Adam out of the earth Prophet said Dar stood with his feet anchored into the Earth from when he came and then God breathed in his nostrils and he became a living Soul see no matter what process you want to call it mom and daddy eating is what brings you and I here you know because that's that's the way it's brought all right now so it was for a reason that he done this let's go to Revelations I noticed this one the other day I thought well I'll bring that in one more too look at Revelations 4:11 he's bragging on somebody thou 't worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou H has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created so there's anything ever going on now if there's a limb to be restored it'll be for his honor and glory and ain't going to be just because you think you got the power it ain't going to be you and me running her big mouth and saying we can do it just remember even your prophet he said God challenged him upon on the word he wasn't just out there going and create squirrels God challenged him on the word because remember the question he had he had a question on that scripture if you'll go back and read it he said if anybody asked me about that he said I would say that that was in other words an Old Testament Covenant part all right other words putting it somewhere that it wouldn't be for you and I but he said God wanted to show him that was much as the word as I think he said John 3:16 I'm not certain to challenge him on that word and speak it you know what he spoke it you know what it created but but it was for him not brother random it was for God's honor and glory and all things are doing any creation that comes it's not going to be well I think the Lord's going to give me a world record deer I'll just speak it into existence what you got a reason for well it need some meat you don't need a world record to eat it wouldn't taste too good you're going to speak anything it's you a young D or a little button head Buck or a spike you see there's too many I told you the other day too many eyes involved I'll do this and I'll do that and everybody will know that I have the power uhuh power of that character is what satanic oh it's Satan doing it what's them i i i i all right but now think about it I want to establish this so giving you certain quotes to establish a point look at number nine which is the fourth taken from the fourth seal paragraph 33 and when the word of the Lord came to him Lord came in him he spoke F and even things created by the word that was Moses wasn't it created by the word all right a creation come into being by the word everything that's created is a spoken word now that's the reason I'm dealing with called The Creator this afternoon is to deal with the word being the Creator in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God all things were created by the word and without that word creating there was nothing ever was or ever will be created all right sin is not a creation I just gave you that one and R around says there's nothing created but Perfection number 10 adoption paragraph 52 God created all things good sin is not not a creation it's a perversion all right not there's only one Creator you can't have more creators so if anything happens again it's going to be God again but where am I trying to get you to see where God is at in you not up in heaven we talk about the Bible you know we say all things are possible it doesn't say all things are possible to God we know that all things are possible to them that believe well you sound like brother Dale you're talking about one of these days we might speak something I am not talking about and for 40 something years I have not talked about a God that was going to do something if that's what you think you need to go back and listen again 40 something years worth when a man tells you the first sermon he preached that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the fullness of the godhead bodily that she would be the son of man am I wouldn't take too much of a negative attitude about that person that's one thing I've always been about the word of God positive very positive about the word well brother Dale I just had done that I'm just well that's good I'm not throwing off on you I just talk about what happened in my life whether you believe it or not right but some of you have been around a while and maybe you're beginning to think a little bit about it anyway hey this old boy has preached the same thing for 40 something years Brother Dean gave me some tapes on faith preached many many years ago I ain't had a chance listen to him yet but you know 77 and I could probably tell you about what's on there and I'm still talking about the same God and still talking about where that God's at a God in heaven won't do you any good a god beside of you perusia paria that won't do you any good a god God living in you your Resurrection is in you amen the change of your body is in you we just got to get it out right we got to get it out into being right to work and then not make it so big until we came a time well that was just for brother bradam and the Lord Jesus see you've automatically put a doubt in people's mind and doubt in our mind you can't have a positive attitude with doubt in your mind did the prophet say the right mental attitude the word any promise he just said the right menal latitude he didn't say the super duper revelation of all he just said the right mental attitude we bring it to bi yeah but brother tell you don't understand we're we're over here we're not back there like them sometimes I wonder if they didn't have more than we do you know what I mean go on to the next one resurrection of Jar's daughter I know I got to quit again look what he says believe with all your heart you shall see the glory of the Lord glory of God the Lord Jesus Christ who is raised from the dead stands here in this audience now that was the things that when that Prophet when I first heard him talking I knew the theological things of churches what I mean by that I knew their doctrines their ways we're going to heaven one of these days but I got problems now but I'm here in a human being and one day I'm going to get me a new body ain't something wrong here when brother Ram started talking isn't it odd that I've been on faith now for quite a while and What's the title of brother brandom's first sermon that he preached in that 1947 faith is the substance the first recorded message begins with a man speaking of Faith he didn't speak of a God if in heaven he spoke of a God on Earth living in mankind I wish I could drive that down the god of William brandom come on Elisha wasn't questioning whether God existed when he said were be the god of Elijah he was just simply making a statement if God was there if God is here he gave me the the double portion I got the double portion oky doie he must be here if he's over there he's here he wasn't questioning where he was at he turned around smoked the water just walked across done Twice The Miracles that Elijah done but think about it look what he says the Lord Jesus Christ is raised from the dead stands here in this audience now his great magnificent being the anointed one from on high on glorious High who blowed the worlds all from his hands as it was right who created All Things by Christ Jesus has come up from the dead and shed forth this which you do now see and hear a living God look at the next one I love this one taken from Jehovah Gyra 57 paragraph or E31 and the Creator who created all things and who made the world by his own word the very dirt that you're sitting over tonight is nothing in the world but God's word made manifest let me put it this way the dirt we're setting in today is that all right amen God said let let there be and it was he believed his own word I know that quote's been with me 40 something years he believed his own word well I'll go out there and try it no he believed his own word every material thing come from the supernatural every material thing come from the supernatural God spoke the world into existence if he didn't where did he get the material to make it with now that's what he's saying are you reading that if he didn't speak it into existence where'd he get it are you reading it if he didn't speak it into existence where'd he get it but that's what he done he made it because it's his word he spoken and said let there be and it was and When God says anything if you'll accept it and hold on accept it and hold on let's read this one then we preach a second and quit when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes over E8 and God Creator who created All Things by his power through his spoken word and everything that is is the word of God made manifest en our world was made and how we do error when we try to ignore God's word or try to limit God's power by our own imagination would you read it over and over and over and how we do error when we try to ignore God's word or try to limit God's power by our own imagination you don't stop on those things and think so it's a great era to limit God's power how do you limit God's power by your imagination I'm serious how do you limit God's power by your imagination but if you imagine something contrary to him right that's sensible if you imagine something contrary to him you limit him if you're thinking what he says it doesn't limit him and look at the Great era that we've been taught well the spoken word is only for brother brandham and the Lord Jesus right did you think you're going to speak the word one of them said hogwash and if I had heard them I wouldn't quote him you said well brother Dale that man's got probably hundreds of thousands of followers and he's deceived them everyone he's deceived him by just limiting God by an imaginations well I just don't see how that can be so uh may I paraphrase a quote something like this that who are you to say those things I got to quote part of it in my mind but who are you to say those things by what are Authority do you say that God is not the same yesterday today and forever who gives you that right well that's what I think well what you think and what I think ain't worth a good thk don't tell you miss that I guess simply means it's not worth even thinking about old southern Georgia language a th a thought all right who gives you and I the right to think of anything contrary in Hebrews 13:8 well brother Dale I think he was godone here but he wouldn't God till he come over here now where did you get that I got a quote no you got a coat because you refuse to listen to the others where he says he's all everything in between and why would our peanut brain try to think about a God in one age they wouldn't be the same God in the next age now I agree that the people in the ages changes but not to God God can't change that's what he said he said I'm God and I change not but what gives any of us any authority to doubt the word of God do you think you're some kind of something great that the world can't operate without you told about that Manar the cotton mill games one time he thought man him and his boys that the plant couldn't operate without him he got mad he went and got his boys walked out the door he said got outside come find out they still operating he went back inside and went to work you know you see you're looking at a man that knows one thing God don't have to have this man he don't have to have you he don't have to have me we have to have him you said well he's got to have somebody yeah but that don't have to be us and if we think he can't do it without us just remember he already has but listen Church when I first heard that Prophet speaking of a living God yeah I done had the contact with him so I knew there was a living God I just didn't have nobody to help me and I've done told you I wasn't born again two years after coming in this message and I count none of that as my new birth what you see Church why can't we as just sensible human beings believe one thing I know I make this statement and it just goes chilled I see it but if there is a God that's not me questioning where he exists or not if there is a God and he can't keep his word straight then I have no desire to serve that God if there's a God that would back up wouldn't back up his word he's not God cuz he and his word are one he spoke it and the sun rises and sets right but a man took his word one day and said Sons stand still and at the words of a man God stopped the world maybe he's M waiting on you and I maybe he's waiting to see what we'll do you never heard me come out here and do this do that and tell the thing no but when I come out here and tell you you can go to the bank with it and don't worry about it right well because I'm not going to talk to you about something that he hadn't talked to me about and showed me that in his word I liked old brother Maloney come on Brothers I like told Brother Maloney and he had in his Bible he had TP and he'd put it in in the spoken word books and he had TP so one day I asked him I said brother Maloney what does that TP stand for I see it a lot in there he said tried and proven I thought well that's a good point he had tried it and he had proved it what about it think on these things let's Stand Together the Creator God way'll be preaching Wednesday the Lord willing I'll finish this next week don't have don't worry about it but the one thing that I'm trying my best to get you and I to see the god that's living in You by the new birth is the same God that said let there be why couldn't he come right back to you if you have to speak your salvation if you have to speak your healing why would it not be that you would have to speak a change of the body Hallelujah what's the problem I must say that I'm already healed before I can receive my healing right I must say I'm already saved before I receive my salvation why would it not be I would have to say that I'm already changed before the change could come is there any problem with that there's no problems if faith is a true substance but if not there will be what we got boys I thank God for these kids and do all of them little and big if they stand there I get p tickle I seen them little bitt they just they got that microphone and they just sucking on it leaking on it I sit back there and just die laughing go
