========================================

[Music] - ewwww amen I want to say to see shiny in the light of your glory or out your power and in love holy hole in the signing in the light of your glory amen or out to the power and love holy holy holy holy [Music] holy holy I want to see you Laurie amen and amen and amen and I want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord he's like turning your scriptures turn to Ephesians I miss Peter Peter where we've been reading then we'll go to acts 4 so we're going from first Peter one to acts 4 kind of picking up our thought moving on a little bit further want to try to conclude this message Sunday if possible but I don't know so we'll see to try to conclude the message that we've been on this is 42 messages so you know at least there's one thing about it you order nowhere 1st Peter 1:22 and 23 is you know that anyway it'll be able to quote that by heart so but it's you know good to see everybody in the house of the Lord and just remember to pray for these that are sitting the different ones and I'll remember sister Gaby's mother there to go to be with them and all the different ones for the ounces to Ana keep them in mind or the dick just remember all the sick among us because God promised he'd send his word and heal us and deliver us from destruction so then that's what we depend on is to that part amen and I wanted to say too now Terrence made some announcements Sunday you might have wondered about this that or the other about the way he said things but he said what was needful about the what he called it the bathroom works around here our water bill has $8,000 a month because of knowledge just kidding gets you out of a sad-sack gets you to a thinking now but it's just the fact that a lot of people and it's not just the children now we've had some problems but getting up and go into the bathroom and and all I can see that hinders people around you so remember that you say yeah but you can't help that now but that's why we plan we make deliberate plans to try to cover time the sunday-school services the children start 15 minutes early right you know why or they can get through 15 minutes after 10 you know why where they can go to the bathroom on the way up the we've tried to cover that we tried to make everything to be convenient we're sorry that we don't have a whole lot of bathrooms but you know still just do the best you can to try to do and see like Tarrant said it was funny that he made the statements and then for one service there was not one person went out to going to the bathroom so now that that oh and one brother he used to tell me say brother Dale you tell me what to do I'm not going to tell you what to do how can you tell anybody when they can go to the bathroom when they came I'm just trying to tell you to be sensible about it and teach your children to obey and and do and you know by the time there are seven or eight years old they should be sitting in the seat beside of you listening to the minister instead of drawing coloring writing notes writing letters adults a lot of times will write on things you know RIT fishermen related but not other things just be do the best we can to try to be as quiet as we can because contrary to popular opinion opinion I don't like to go to Walmart even and hear somebody there with a kid in and and this come it's making a complete destruction of the whole place and they're just standing there you notice looking around like one whose kid that is you know you know but that's just be the best we can all right do the best we can you gotta go go all right but just remember and you don't have to go twice and it's kind of like when one brother one brother told me one time he said and he made a mistake he said I can sit and wail for five hours without hardly moving said I love to wail I said he made a mistake because he told me one day he said but this long services and at that time he wasn't too long you know at all when he said these long services just get me I went you know what I wanted to say welding five hours but you can't sit for an hour and a half see don't worry about it you're not getting by with it it's all recorded yeah and that's what I say we say something and people are deliberately rebelled against that now when you do just remember you're rebelling against the authority of the whole church let alone the fact of this somebody making a statement you know so don't do that don't do it that way okay all right I just hold hardly agree with order and things brother Brown said even a child running backwards and forth in the church will hinder the next service now you say you believe you was a prophet but do we believe those things you know he said somebody with a bad attitude come in and bind the whole circuit he said you'll give an account for that that's you know what would it be more sensible you know we claim to say I was thinking about that today you know we say the you know the people over here would say well in another church or something well you know that's this your way I think and we think this way that was if we follow a prophet what he says we don't have to under about whether you believe this or you believe that it's whether or not we believe what he said because he was trying his best to make us all and I'd still say it too you know he was a human being and people are human beings I've said in a lot of services and you have to I mean listening to tapes not at the Tabernacle but I listen to a lot of tapes in my lifetime and you know what there'll be children on our Holland talking screaming and write this while the Prophet is preaching his heart out he's just so gracious he just keeps right on going how he seals that out I don't know I can do a pretty good job of it you know because doors open this with them and I do a pretty good job of cutting it out you can't cut everything so just yes just okay all right do those things all right we're going to first Peter and then we will go to ax for father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for the word that we have the ability Lord to be able to believe it thank you for your understanding Lord that you've given unto each and every one of us that we can look to you the author and finisher of our faith and Lord we love you and we thank you we want the people to know we love them cuz that's what we're trying our best to save our souls all of us and to try to help each and every one of us to be what you want us to be just have your way let your loving grace be with us forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in Jesus name amen okay Oh favorite first Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever all right what is the new birth how long have we been teaching it 40-something years since I heard the Prophet and read the scripture what the new birth is the birth of the word now tell me anything else it could be well I shouted I cried as well that's aftereffect what is the birth all right now let's go to acts 4 and we'll begin reading at verse 7 through 12 and when they had set them in the midst they asked you know this is the disciples when they come in and the high priests and always asking them says by what power or about what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them you rulers are the people and elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done done to the impotent man by which means what means he has made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him that this man stand here for you hope this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other there's no salvation no words else but in that corner where there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby you must be saved amen you may be seated that is blessing to the reading of the word now this statement here that we just read about the stone which the builders you know disallowed that's actually covered counting this scripture it's covered almost verbatim to the tee of wording in this in Psalms 48 it's in Matthew 21 it's in mark 12 and Luke 20 plus where we're at now that he is the corner stone all right now then let's get to point of where we've been for a while and try to just review up a little bit to her that we are into what we're talking about okay now the last message we were laying it heavily we had company so I had to divert around and I don't mean wrong I love company it makes us a lot of times back up and say things different so it's not our say well we had to I blame the company no no see we try to blame everybody else but ourselves but you know I love company to come because it makes you think a little different preaching a little different act a little different and you're doing but we did have a good bit of company in our Sunday so I had to back up Conda and trying to talk about the prophets message that you know we we've studied it we went through it I contend one thing because that's why I've always believed it that the new birth is the birth of the word all right now the new birth now you tell me what else it would be what are you talking about what anything else could you say or even think or even we're allowed to penetrate the cranium cap of your brain as we call it to think about anything other than the birth of the word what did the Prophet say Christ mister God revealed the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you all right see in that new birth then is the birth of the word okay now watch that in a minute when we get to what is the headstone we'll be covering that in a minute we get down to it if not we'll go as far as we can all right the now the stature of a perfect man covers how that God is showing how to us to come to the position he wants us to come to all right it starts with the new birth which is faith all right now starting there then and it ends up with the headstone or capstone coming forth all right but we've read here now and we ought to be able to follow it that when Jesus Christ came into the world he was to Israel Almighty God the head of all things all right he was the King of Kings the Lord of glory he was the headstone okay all right now because what was he what is the headstone what is the cornerstone the cornerstone is the Word of God is that sensible I mean that should be a thought to our mind it is the Word of God it is God's Word that is revealed to you and I it's a cornerstone that's what got me you know when I heard the story told of it that word that when brother Branham had talked about the cornerstone and did he put some things in there and to come find out they went in there and tore that stone open to try to find out what it was that's sick of me when I heard that too to the bottom into my heart why anybody would want some kind of an idea I don't care who it is I don't care who went in there they were mentally sick you say you shouldn't talk that away why not they was trying to find something well if he wanted us to find it he would have told us what it was but to go in and tear in to try to find that something within that and they had in their hands are the ability are the the tapes the books etc to tell you what was in that corner he said what was in that we wanted to know what was in that corner I thought the word was the cornerstone I thought the reason it wound up being a cornerstone was that Israel as we read rejected Israel Peter learned in act they rejected Jesus Christ as their head thank God they did well blow unto them that happened by right cuz you realize if they had not of turned down that headstone you and I would not be here it would have been a Jewish thing scepter Li to Israel and it would have been no Gentiles involved we'd have been totally out of it so thank God for what they done but woe unto them that done it what else could he come to and I remember when I was in the badges I used to think about you know the the white people done and I'd read the Bible and you know and in reading it it would tell about the things they'd done to him and how they treated him and you know what he done raise the dead he'll too sick fed to people I remembered thinking about that wasn't a Baptist Church thinking God you never done nothing but right what would they get any justification no point to be able to kill them or anything let alone I mean if the fact of just turning him down is their Savior their master look what it's Costin you know you don't think like that I think about it some death and considering look at the way they treated you Lord and all you ever done was treated them good he was the headstone to the church all right he was rejected by Israel as the head and very stood in what was he in the beginning was the word Word was with God and the Word was God and Word was made flesh and dwelt among us what Wade's been on trying to express to you about son of man see Jesus Christ fulfilled all of those things I was thinking oh today we're thinking about when when you remember brother Bosworth that's that what was the name dr. bass or something when he asked him or said I've got one question I'd like to ask and he said there's a seven compound names of Jehovah applied it's Jesus Christ little random even said one time where he said I never thought that he said they wouldn't no way in the world a man can go anywhere said because if he was Jehovah Rapha he was Jehovah Jireh if he was our Savior he'd have to be our healer to all be straight all right now think of the same way that the Lord Jesus Christ and his earthly journey had to fulfill the four things the Son of God well let's make it correct son of man first then son of God then back to son of man and then son of David do you believe he fulfilled all of those things which is check out who they were to see to it well he was the word the son of man which the son of man I knew this in a Baptist Church we used to study it that son of man means resurrection because that's what he said he said I'm the resurrection see he he was the resurrection the son of man that's why he's got to come back in the end time into the bride for the resurrection to take place all right but you see they couldn't understand him when he would say was son of man they said you're a man making yourself God now his garden making himself a man see they had it backwards they couldn't figure it out but yet he wound up he fulfilling the scriptures and they still rejected him all right but then on the day of Pentecost he could not come to the Gentile dispensation as the headstone because you can how the headstones you got the cornerstone first there's a message about two rows down pipes this one that'll be talking about sometimes it'll help us to understand that about like former and latter rain a different thing all right see he could not become now listen very carefully cuz I hate to just keep saying it you know you read it in the Bible that he was the head of the church I mean the Bible says that that he was the head of the church uh-huh but what is it saying he was not the headstone because that was rejected he was the head of the corner he left his position who it should have been the entire pyramid then and come down to be the chief Cornerstone which Chief means the the corner the corner the one you foundation stone in other words you start building the house you start one place all right then you let out from that place if you get that place everything works good but if you don't it gets all out of shape all right we see he become the headstone of the corner are the head of the corner he become the head of the church on the day of Pentecost when the baptism of the Holy Ghost came into the disciples that they had been tutored and trained by that word for 3.5 years following the Lord Jesus all right hearing him talking and seeing the signs and wonders knowing that he was saying something and then seeing that he you know that they saw he was rejected by the Jews but he couldn't become he couldn't come straight to the church as the headstone he had to come to the church as the cornerstone because that would start to pyramid go look where you'd have the thing turned totally upside down but he becomes the headstone are the head of the corner he become the foundational stone all right and what is the Bible saying Ephesians built on the foundation apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being what the chief Cornerstone one see the disciple had no message of their own I want to get to that a little bit Sunday that's why I keep saying that you don't follow maybe my thoughts but see if you listen to not how the prophets message had to come you will see then what took place in the day in the hour that was back tyre the Lord willing but listen when Israel rejected the head stone cornerstone whatever you want to call it really they rejected the new birth is that right now remember now we'll come to Jesus with with John 3 what was Jesus's first message you must be born again you must be born from above he explained it to him of what they needed and they rejected that and even the disciples couldn't understand that because even after his resurrection when he met with him over in the book of Acts they said will you return the kingdom to Israel at this time they still didn't see he was speaking of a spiritual Kingdom that we would become to them the word of the cornerstone because the headstone had been rejected there was no way could come into manifestation no now listen even if it hadn't been for Israel involved in it there would still be no way that you could bring the Gentile dispensation into being of the headstone because you gotta have the corner stone before the headstone can come or else you're trying to put the corner stone on top of the headstone now you've got to build something for for God to cap off right so then you see the Gentile dispensation as it come into being and Jesus preaching to those disciples the son of man actually sowed the seed right the son of man sowed the seed of the kingdom all right he went away gave his life prophet said he passed away on the part of son of man he come back as son of God the new birth into the church giving birth to that word that he had sown into their hearts and there was the cornerstone all right so the cornerstone now is the new birth now you've got the pyramid started so you look at faith and you look at the statue of a perfect man this is what I've been trying to preach all the time you look at that any of you ever studied the pyramids you ever looked at the drawing of that you realize the whole kingdom everything is within there I was thinking today about it you just to mention a little bit of you look at the natural pyramid when you enter in you come down here there's an upside-down chamber they know nothing about Hawaiian there's an upside-down chamber one because we everybody entered the world upside down out of cater and lost then you start back up through the pyramid you come through the Queen's Chamber and into the King's Chamber and there's three blocks into that tunnel going up that keeps you from going up and that's justification Saint case the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not trying to preach a pyramid doctrine we're trying to preach it or tell the truth of what everything is spoken on placed in the correct order alright now see then the headstone which was Jesus Christ as it was rejected by Israel he becomes the cornerstone to the permeate I mean to to the church on the day of Pentecost he came back in the form now listen to what I'm saying he came back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the word made alive alright are you listening to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you received is the word that was made alive to you and that's where the birth is that inside of you in your soul changing it to making it into the position that God can come and dwell in all right so the Pentecostal church started out the way God wanted it right by the new birth coming into the hearts of the Saints and see that birth what if they hadn't heard the word then what's these statements they're going to be valuable later on what if they hadn't heard the word I've always tried to emphasize that the Bible said he was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection another scripture were they on the net Pentecost he got a hundred and twenty that leaves 380 of them that didn't get there why there was something wrong with them they didn't have their heart set in the right point our position but if they had they'd have been in that Upper Room see maybe they hadn't heard enough word to get to the basis of understanding but I've never decrease teen I've been because really I like the way the Bible says thing it says a 500 brethren I'm not saying they didn't go and receive the new birth a lot of them come on later probably into the kingdom not D Christianizing nobody and saying they was lost but they did not accept Jesus Christ at that time and he became the head of the corner or the head of the New Testament church all right that's Paul in his writings and I think he's in theevans that he becomes the head all right now being that head then look if the head now I'm asking you a simple question I want you to say this simple if the corners if the headstone was the word made alive in human flesh the Lord Jesus Christ then what would be the headstone the revealed word right made flesh in a man what would be the end time is the headstone and you see he became the word made flesh because there's a lot of saying or timer or what if you call it this thirty something years or thirty years between John one where it said in the beginning was the word words with God the Word was God and verse 14 where it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us there's a lot of time in between there that he was that word all right what see when he when he did now keep that doubt in your mind this is the one saith the headstone was the revealed word are the alive word now I have never taught the new birth has been an intellectual conception of the Word of God it wouldn't matter if I have read six books in one day and listened to two tapes I still didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost with how many people would put all of that intellectualism or thoughts opponent and say well I had to be warned again look what I've done yeah I rejected my family I rejected just about everything I mean this pullback away and just stayed the best I could do and just read and read and read and read and studied this message he said no my dearest and is a little nano got right now cut it in a pack is a church age book and you know what I got in the other part of my pack is earphones with a tape player you know what I'm doing while I'm deer hunting I have went through three tapes just cycle through them sitting there go what are you gonna do I mean you're just looking what are you gonna do you know so I just said turn read or listen to tapes why because that's my desire I love God's Word all right let's see if we don't get to word in the field and okay it won't work all right but now remember the point listen and we'll get to the other point in a minute the headstone which was all of the Word of God now listen all of the Word of God stood on earth in a man called Jesus Christ you go with that now there are some things that he said that Israel I mean the assault and the Apostles didn't understand but you just remember now cause you see you're gonna run off on the dead in Jesus preached the seals that's Matthew 24 all right he preached them but nobody knew what he's talking about how that way she's that way you don't add to the word so don't get any thought than when I say it when he was standing a tire on the sort of guy that was Almighty God will you agree that was the Son of Man the Son of God the Son of David the son of everything we needed but he had to make these stage manifest along the journey to be this and then to be this and then be this but he was the word made alive not just a man made alive not just a human being we call Jesus I see Jesus only doctrines and things no he was the Lord Jesus Christ standing on earth in a human flesh in him the Bible said dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily all right now what's this thing going to wind up being wade was asking when I taught on the son of man what he was saying about where we were trying to let up in line was in 82 of all of you heard me at least make the statement the first sermon I preached in this message in 1969 in Athens Georgia after receiving the baptism of the holy ghost of 2 years in this message I preached a sermon brother Mansfield wanted to need to take a service while he was going to be gone for the weekend and I took a couple of services and I taught that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man I still got written in front of my Bible a lot of the quotes were your prophet City but are you gonna listen to him are you gonna listen to your own thoughts and ideas see that's why if I read to you what he said you can't argue because you claim to be believe in the message so you can't deny you can call the intellect you can call me anything you want to I don't care but you can't say that I didn't tell you what he said well if you're out you know come on I don't matter if it's my idea who it is if I read to you John 3:16 that is God's Word yeah but I believe see that's where the thing goes wrong the word said it the word is right it don't make no difference whether we say it right or what we do but all I ask you to do is come show me then in here 40 something years later 50 years later still believing that the bride of Jesus Christ will be the Word made flesh in the end time and there is your son of man I'm just trying to get you to think about it see there stood Almighty God in human flesh but now listen staying in that position he could not save no one he consoled the seed which he did he sowed the kingdom of mi in the Gospels the Son of Man is the sower of the seed he sowed the seed of the kingdom the devil showed us to see to what happened on the day of Pentecost what had been sown into the hearts that's why everybody didn't make it that's why the 500 didn't get there they didn't how that works own down in their heart they had parts and maybe things but they didn't have it but there's only a hundred and twenty had it enough into their hearts and by gaining that's your to understand it was twelve was all they was back here one of them was the devil told you back to 11 take Matthias Prettyman making you 12 which we know it was wrong for them to do that they couldn't wait on Paul to become the one but he came to 13th and that was perfectly scriptural cousin in the Old Testament it was twelve tribes gathered around the Levites which is in the middle study your Bible they were twelve tribes gathered around the one tribe which was Israel I mean which wouldn't leave us and leave I had no inheritance God said I'm your inheritance what he brought around say when he went out there and standing looking up at all those buildings it's like God said you there's mine there's yours the whole heavens which is the Word of God okay listen see the cornerstone Jesus Christ had to become the cornerstone to the church in the new birth which would be the birth of that word at the head take taken and held on to all right and when they receive the new birth it was the word that was made alive nukkie followed me see it was the word that was planted made alive by the baptism of the holy ghost see that's a new birth that's why I brought around and we'll cover the baptism of the holy ghost as being the new burner it is you gotta have something to quicken the word the dead letter of the word is not no course not no headstone and it ain't even the cornerstone the letter of the words not a cornerstone headstone or nothing but the revealed word that's why I've always told you and I'm sincere in meaning it I would to God I had revealed to me what is in this head of what I heard that prophet say do you not think like that I wouldn't do God did all of that was revealed to me but one day I will now I love the promise he said I'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever I've said and I like this one and he said even teach you things to come brother Brennan said he not only brought to the disciples what they what he had taught him but he said he taught him on the future things to come he told them things to come all right they went on wrote the book The Book of Revelations and I mean the the acts in a different time all right yeah now watch what I'm saying see then if we can see that the new birth has always been the birth of the word as you can follow that talk that the new birth has always been the birth of the word what else is it I cried I shouted I spoke in tongues brother Dale just don't understand what the birth is hey just get the baptism in the Holy Ghost one day on what you got and don't worry about the shout another thing didn't take care of itself all right we can talk all night long if you want to talk about some presence of the Lord I can talk with you so then don't don't play with me and be serious because you've heard me say it for years and years so there's one thing about it and I stand up here or not and saying it I've seen God I've smelled him I've been in his presence and I've had him to talk to me and tell me things but I just don't lay on that because I know you get to building on it and you'll wind up to be to wear that you'll be building on that base I don't wanna I want you built on the basis of the word that's revealed to you not what he's done for me what he's done for you I love your experience I'll withhold telling of my experience to hear yours because I love it all right but listen then if the new birth is the birth of the word it's been that in every age cuz ever was a the age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the individual in every age they had a word to be brought for that age in time the new birth was the birth of that word that's why Martin Luther was already a believer he was a priest in all kind of things he'd already went to a lot of things but then God spoke to him about the just shall live by faith and that was his new birth that's what turned the world upside down not Martin Luther protests in the Catholic Church uh-huh it's like I've told you that devil he didn't get mad then people didn't get mad for for Martin Luther going out to our doing those thing but when the people begin to listen to Martin Luther and experience the same birth he experienced then the devil got mad see that's what I've always expected I want to stir him up I want to make that devil so mad or trying to preach the word until he'll come after us wherever way why because the Prophet said the bride always does better under persecution well oh you you want persecution on us huh no I just know it's coming because the Prophet said it we're experienced now you can't scare you that don't work ain't scared to devil out of nobody you scared more Devils in and you scare out don't try to secure it out of people you know try to talk them to the wrong thing that's why it's not that away it's like I was saying our Sunday if we can just believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and living in our hearts and giving something personal to us and this is something to you and me you know no wonder the devil get upset all right season if the new birth is the birth of the word now let's lay it on our heart if the new birth is the birth of the word and now you tell me I'm serious I don't mean be sarcastic or hateful you tell me something else about the new birth beside it being the birth of the word you can't tell me what it is beside being the birth of the work cuz you're gonna make it some kind of shouting speaking in tongues grunting I believed it so did the devil now were you at he'd believe more than we do because the Bible said he believed one garden trembled you ever trembled about the fact that what God is showing you you've never been in his presence then because any as president is not a great big thing that you think glory hallelujah stir no it's not it's a very serious matter to stand in the presence of Almighty God there's not no glory hallelujah shouting and running around it's a very sincere matter to ever think about standing in the presence of Almighty God to think of him coming down to us okay listen see then if the new birth is the birth of the word and Jesus Christ had to die to release that life that was within him that it could come back upon the disciples that he had planted within them and he came back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the new birth the birth of the word they had heard that was why that when they received it they could come all the way up here to where it said Holy Spirit but the 3,000 outside that received it a little later on in the day could only come to faith and be F babes desire the sincere milk of the word when Paul and when Peter was and then were saying these things that we've read about babe they were talking about their selves Paul wouldn't said Peter your baby no he rebuked him openly from way words though because he had problems right but brother Ron said it was not over doctrine it was just the way Peter behaved himself all right which is he Peter wouldn't tell him Paul that he was a baby and Paul wouldn't telling Peter he was maybe it was telling the others that there were babies desiring the sincere of milk of the word that they may grow thy body see that we might grow up in him who is the head of all things am i quoting scriptures so then if the new birth is the birth of the word then what would be the headstone what would be the headstone because she's remember now - before they could have a birth they had to have a message all right are you it before the holy ghost could come upon the disciples they had to have the message that the Lord Jesus Christ taught them shone down in their hearts and then when the Holy Ghost would come it would quicken that was shown into their heart that's the message that was made alive one of their Pentecost that's the word I'm talking about that's the word made flesh a lot if that be true then what would be the headstone would it not be the birth of the full word would it not be the birth of that work when I've got a couple of them laying here if you want to listen to him on blasphemy it's nights where brother Brennan says I'm Bert we're birthed into this into this into this earth into these times each one of these virtues you're gonna have to be birthed into that virtue you're not birthed into patience and then come back down and get virtue you've got to be birthed into virtue knowledge temperance and then expect the birth of patience all right but get to one thing if you don't get nothing else out of the message tonight if we believe the new birth is the birth of the word ah I've tried to explain what that is the word that Jesus Christ sewn into their hearts was made alive to them on the day of Pentecost they came out of there capable of telling the others about Jesus that's why I've asked you just to read acts 2 and a 1 and 2 and they come out of that upper room Paul Peters got a message right read it he goes all the way back in the Old Testament and brings down Jesus Christ read acts 1 and 2 he brings him right down to where it's at and said this is the one that you builders has rejected or said it not said he's now the head of the church by being the chief Cornerstone of that church he's the head of it then cuz he says had a headstone but not the headstone because listen are you listening see Jesus Christ preached some things that was not made of life to them disciples tire earth were the case is that that's what it's all linked to what did he preach to them disciples are preached that they didn't get they could question him about the kingdom he explained the kingdom he told him all about the new birth he told him about this order the seat he told him about all of the parables right but what was it he'd ever told them and what was it that mankind has never known until the last days then you'll see what I was trying to get at Sunday that the Prophet did have a message he had a message this wouldn't be good and go to church and try to hide and dress and clothes that's all they want to preach about the message and say that's the it oh we're gonna find that life seed praise God I hope we do I hope he's here tonight but it won't be just to that hunting the life seed I know we're brother Brown said he was hunting that life seed sure praise God we all ought to be but what if that seeds already in what's gonna happen then see then if the new birth was the birth of the word of the day of Pentecost that made the disciples alive in the kingdom knowing that they were the cornerstone with Jesus Christ and that's why it says in Ephesians that were built on the foundation apostles and prophets Jesus Christ foundation sees the starting stone Jesus Christ being the head stone or the head of the corner see them disciples had a message when they came out of the Upper Room do you have a message oh yeah I got a message God sent a prophet God sent a prophet amen now tell me what the Prophet taught praise God we believe that God sent a prophet what do you saw him now if you saw him said personal in front of you and him preaching thank God but you know that didn't convert you you say yeah I got the Holy Ghost right it takes the word being quickened to be the birth so just don't base it on I saw the prophet or ate with the Prophet so you can't do that even though everybody in this building I myself would have loved to have been tonight but I do also know that it wouldn't have changed me one bit why because I know now what the birth is I might have had trouble with it back I hurt but I know now what the birth is as newborn babes first Peter two cauldrons cornerstone people birth of the word on the day of Pentecost now if that be true and I'll leave that as a question to you is it true that the new birth is the birth of the word surely you're not going to go to anything incorruptible and try to bring a birth that's why I read that in first Peter I mean first if first Peter 1:22 and 23 being born again that's what's happening this new birth starts us and then we're being born again through the birth of the word because we know for a certainty the hour the day that we're living that what happened in this day jump across with us now the South was lost apart they the word went into the ground and everything you know the bugs ate it down but remember there was one thing the books never ate down they never ate the new birth away now come on you can go I'll give you a quote I'll help you find that cuz I know what brother Brown said I look lad to help you find it that it sounds exactly like he said that they lost that that they lost that new birth they lost that he turned a lot it sounds just like it but now you tell me it is and I'll tell you they somethin wrong with you you know what arguing with a prophet you're just not listening to what he's saying the new birth is the birth of the word uh-huh spoken words original seeds paragraph 151 the birth of the word is Christ you must be born again the birth is the word it's the word that's made alive and you and I to give us a new birth then the headstone capstone whatever you want to call it would have to be the word made alive to the church that's why brother branham had to start where he did but I tried to get you to see that Sunday it doesn't say when he walked out there on the river he doesn't say what we say it says the voice said as John the Baptist forerun the first coming he had her message to introduce right the Messiah says your message will forerun the second coming so then he was gonna have to have a message he had to have a message and they had to be something in the Bible that was not preached of mankind that would be that message but it's got to be in the Bible Code as I said I want to go see you try to add anything to it then you're off the word remember that's what they said to brother Branham said with your ability you could write he said that be adding to the word you can't do that he said it was what was in the word and we're quoting it correct what was in the word that light had never shined upon what was in the word that light had never shined on then you'll see what brother ins message was his message would not be in addition to the word it cannot be a profit cannot add to the word no more than anybody else can add to the word it has to be already in the word a part of the world but lighted not shined upon that so then if the new birth is the birth of the word and Israel rejected that word they rejected the Messiah they turned down the baptism of the holy ghost but it still came and came upon the early church at Pentecost being the chief Cornerstone are the revealed Word that was made alive and Peter says and that's what I love Peter comes over in his message introducing the fact code of showing the he had a message come on you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got a message what did Prophet say what's gonna go out here and get my degrees in it he said no he said go tell him how the candle got lit there's your message don't know what's within this man is what to be broke that's been made known to me but that has nothing to do with you it's only the basis that I'm trying my best to get you to see the Word of God has got to be revealed to you not cause mama done it daddy done it my wife's good that's better than that ain't it where's the matches you've got them discipled had a message I'm asking read acts 2:1 and over in the tooth Peter had a message and this is what I live he said this is that right this is that that was spoken of by the prophets that was his message he was standing there with something alive within him it's what you have a live or just dead letter but if I'll put that back how to leave in your laughs if you can see the new birth was and how always have been the birth of the word you see what Luther would already a convert what it will call him whatever he was probably a great man walking in the light of he was riding great theses and preaching great messages but all that want something come alive is this message alive - you know he was allowed to read random we don't have to do nothing that's what that man said that time I'm throwing over God I simply preached a little message you've heard me tell it and said this is my revelation let's see if what brother Brennan says will compare to that that brother he and I used to he used to eat in our home we used to be together weekly I mean we're just anything I needed with his and I had a little car problem wouldn't run one time and he said take my big ol Buick and grouted jeffersonville because that's where we was going that's no I can't do it he said no I'll take my car he was just a great guy but you know what he said he sent me word he said brother Dale don't know how no more do with it you know forget it something to that degree he's because you said you had a revelation he said I got a revelation that brought around zone once got a revelation I didn't get mad and upset with him I thought that the human intelligence of a man should not have been that dumb not like a no-joke of the man I loved him but the human intelligence you know what I mean human intelligence what did I say I said I had a revelation and let's see if what brother Branham says compares with that revelation I said I had a revelation he said I don't have a revelation my revelation is that brother branham's the only ones got the revelation well he said he had a revelation ha oh the argument with me about it I said I had one he said he had one this is a church that's where we don't think we do okay but listen what is it in the Bible where is it in the Bible the headstone message cuz we get over in the scriptures and wanted to he send a headstone crying grace grace right he said the messenger would have to have a message in the end time you see those are quotes coming from a prophet about his message and I gave you up this quote after quote still got him laying here before said not in the years of preparation but said when he began to sound said not in the years of the healing campaigns but the message that followed the healing campaign litterin said knowing all alone this message would come and here it is and he said and I've been preaching it 30 years come on was he with me Sunday spoken words original seed read the message and listened to the tape letter and preached his message up to so far in stocks that said lord I can't go no further I got him out on a limb I'm quoting him the Holy Spirit says pick up your pen and ride went right back and I asked you to do that read that to the church it was exactly showing he was standing on the word he was showing God was showing brother Branham that what he had preached was exactly right that's why I get so sick of those people that believe that brother Branham was correct after the seals broke but before the seals you can't believe what he preached I deny that on the basis of God's Word that ain't even common sense how could you have God's Word part truth and then it finally come out to real truth it was the word all the time it was just not understood or not see didn't we know that Jesus done something that mankind never knew anything about he preached six seals in Matthew 24 right but where did anybody say anything about that or did any Paul Peter any of say anything about it you don't listen it's like I've tried to get you to think about it Matthew Mark Luke and John talked to the son of man come on they wrote what Jesus told them but you show me one of them after then that mentioned son of man tell me one writing after the Matthew Mark Luke and John that Paul or any of them talked about the Son of Man they didn't see it were did any of them preach anything about Jesus preach in the field and worded brother Branham in his early ministry until he preached the seals I invite you see if you can find word before he preached the seals up in 263 there in jeffersonville that was his first time of mentioning as far as I've been able to find of Matthew 24 and that Jesus had preached six seals oh yeah he read scriptures about it he said some things about cuz you know what we could Baptist we could Baptist used to preach that Matthew 24 or 24 22 23 24 somewhere and I it's in 24 that the sixth seal you know the tribulation we've had this preached that the Tribulation Period was Matthew 24 you heard me tell it I told him an artwork one day they were making light of us calling us buzzards because we'd they said they're they think their Eagles if someone said the other buzzards I said hey look folks I know a little bit more about this and you think I do I said there's 40 something different Eagles they are vulture eagles so don't go around hollering all about this stuff oh they call me everything they even call me as she you know that I was to ahead of all of them told me a homosexual or forgive me for using the word but you know what that didn't make me mad at nobody I never said a word this one preacher Pentecostal preacher he was life in one day and he said yeah I said that's where them vulture eagles dire in the scripture I said I want to ask you brother one time I said where that scripture talks about to come into the son of man I said is it is it not true that you teach in your doctrine in your church that that is their coming the end of the world and the coming of the Messiah he just stopped he froze and he looked at me he said I'll never say out another word about you because I knew the church world talk Matthew there of the going up over into worth the carcass is the Eagles be gathered that they talked that is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ until the day I left at work I never he never said another word about us now faced him with the word now listen you remember the pyramid message you remember the the seeing of the tone and seeing how that he took a bar and whipped to top off and look down in and he's seen things in her that light had never shined upon it is it not that he related that to the seals of the when he gets to the seals message well that that was what it was lot had never shined on no seals in Matthew 24 so there's your headstone the opening of those seven seals not let her pay on the page revealing okay we're way behind on it with brothers can y'all catch up to the number eight I hadn't asked him to even use it on most of these we've used them over and over but can you catch up to number eight let's see if I can follow it they had a lot of reading on this one so I'll hang on and then God takes his messenger this is all for the first seal all right 1963 takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them aside asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejected a temporary judgment then after that is over then he goes on they denominated and bring in denominations and start off with that man's work like of Wesley and all the rest of them then it go gets in a group scrapple again and then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on the earth for a church age so each church age gets a message and a messenger right then when he arrives he the trumpet sounds he declares war see and then what happens finally then he's called away and then when he's laid away then plague plague falls destroys them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then he goes on to another one and it's a great plan until it comes to the last angel now he has no certain mystery listen to it but he gathers up all that's been lost in them other ages all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet see as the revelation come then he reveals those things in his day if you want to read it there it is revelations 10 one two one two four you get it now let's stop this says this the word I said it while ago on the Ohio River he didn't say you heart Attorney you'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers etc that wasn't said on Ohio River he said your message will forerun the second coming then he goes on to explain malachi for melikhaya forced to do two things turn arts or the children back to the faith through the father and reveal the seven thunders which is revelation contained in the seven seals to be these two finally revealed mystery truth they literally turn our hearts back alright he's holding it here now that he's already preached it and he has okay takes a book and seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel it's all got to be in order go back and read this it's all got to be in order before you can come to the seals that's what gets me as I said well ago people say brethren was wrong before the sealed and right after I challenge that on the basis of God's Word out on the internet anywhere you're at come and show me come and show me and I'll come back to this church and announce your name and who you was and how you straightened me out cuz I ain't worried about it you ain't coming you've got enough sense to know better than to come because you say brother Brown was wrong as early ministry that makes you a greater God didn't brother Branham could ever you know that make you God instead of a man because only God can straighten out a prophet what brother Branham had to straighten out he straightened out and what he didn't straighten out we better leave it alone that's sensible enough look what he does takes a book and seals and breaks them and shows a seventh angel for alone the mysteries of God for this alone what the seventh angel the mystery of God is the ministry of the seventh angel he's to return all back to the faith of the fathers then something happens come on read now we just got through the church ages with him even history proved it is the angel's message of the seventh church because that's where people came follow you got a have a seventh church age messenger brother Branham was not the seventh church messenger the seventh church age messenger with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't even know your message I'll be glad to sit down and talk with you about it if you don't know the message you got eight manifestations of God but you only got seven men if you don't place that correctly you sure miss the whole message and I don't worry because come on alright revealed all the mystery that's been the price all the things in the Pais revelation 10:1 that now remember in the days of the seventh angel his sounding forth blastin forth the gospel trumpet he is to finish all the mysteries of God just like here come forth in the early church age we'll get it after a while a doctrine then it become a sayin first then a doctrine and then it'll become a statute then become a church and through the Dark Ages and out of the Dark Ages come the first Reformation Lutheran bro and he brought with him all kinds of mysterious things that happened during the church age all back in dark and then but he never finished a role I don't know where we can hold it that point and I will remember one thing if you'll listen to what Wade's trying to brain there's the brother run says in a sealed book the third seal he said there's a mysterious part of justification mysterious part of sanctification a mysterious part of the baptism of the holy ghost that light had never shined on now is that what he's just said with Luton Luke had done the best he could do but he couldn't finish it he couldn't bring the message to completion then Along Came West through sanctification got some more of us still never finished it left loose ends ever worse such as sprinklin instead of baptism and Luther took Father Son and Holy Ghost instead of the Lord Jesus Christ all these different things that alone come to Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they cabbage down on that now there cannot be no more ages that's all of its that's the fill it out our the lady of sin age but then we found in the study of the scriptures that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age and at the end of the age every time Paul comes at the end of the age we find out Iranians come at the end of the age Martin now listen what he's saying Martin into the age Luther at the end of the Catholic age and what Wesley at the end of Luther's age and Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me to not to show you through here that we are to see it receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rap string of the church the messenger come to the end of the age now draw that out on a piece of paper and short term me but a random just told you he just read how they come roll to bring that back down he just read it he just said it come on back down on down a little further huh they can't down Luther we found in the study of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age ever time see you think that Paul come right here and brought a message you know into the age if he come at the end of the age how did he bring the message to the church at Ephesus he'd have been bringing this message to the next age you're not even listening not even thank you well brothers dad we don't have to understand these time you explained it I'll ask the questions you explained it I love questions so I'll ask the question you come up here and explain it you say that's being sarcastic put me what you want to the message is right what you think of me is nothing to me but what this message is right because that's where I've stood listen to what he said we found in the study this Christmas a messenger coming to in right at the end of the age every time Paul come at the end of the age did Paul come here or did he come here if he come here he wouldn't be the messenger to the church in Ephesus he coming to end of Pentecost and brought the church message to Ephesus when it died and went in the ground Iranians picked it up at the end and bringing it forth I'm reading it to you listen Paul comes into the age we find out Iranians come at the end of the age Martin into the age Luther the end of the Catholic age well I didn't know this cat engage with in arguing him and what Wesley at the end of Lutheran age so where did Wesley come did Wesley come right here or did he come right here if he come at the end of Luther's age he's right I don't put it okay we've been in this for 40 years come on listen Wesley at the end of the lutheran a and pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Zeus the street and at the end of the Pentecostal age is that here or is he here come on at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me to not to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those Lucien's out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapture of the church there's the message there's your message brother Branham come to brain the opening of those seals cuz that's the only thing that was not written in the word as far as anybody could understand anything it was written our Matthew 24 but no light could ever shine on it until he came into being are you with me listen Church see we just sat down and we think and then I come out and I try to preach something and was just intellectualism UK pay no attention to what he's saying cause you can't understand him I read it I read what run around and says that the messenger coming to the end of the age we go one two three four five six seven oh we got that brother branham goes one two four five six seven eight if the Prophet had the message we claimed he had then it's the message of eternal life or you gonna have to have another messenger did I read it is this the way we want it or we don't want to do we want another message yesterday's luther's man-mana would not work for the methodist methodist mana would not work for pentecost Pentecostal mana will not work for the debt for today see what I mean every day it comes day by day fresh and so has it through the entire church's Luther's mana was the message of justification Wesley I'm reading from there's a man here they could turn on the lights we only pull it up number 10 all right yesterday Luther's manonoff Luther's mana was the message of justification now am i right when I said Luther got Luther would already a converted believer but one day something struck he got his message that just shall live by faith John Wesley came to America to preach as a missionary to convert the Indians and wound up with meeting the Moravians or ever he pronounced that they were teaching sanctification he goes back home and he says hold I went to America to convert the Indian come and find out I had to be converted I got the message of sanctification he had a message when he went back home he was sailing across glory hallelujah we're Methodists we're going well glory we're good Methodists oh this all this happy and going back home he's gone ray he had a message Luther had a message Luther's manna was the message of justification Wes his message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecost was the restoration of the gifts look but this is introducing the headstone the last day the bride tree which is contoured all of it and yet it's the same light for the material are you listening introducing the headstone all right go to the next one number 11 the voice of the sign we're told that in the last days that will repeat again there's going to be a message come forth that will introduce the Messiah to the people and it'll be in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded like they did then he promised it the next chapter of Matthew Malachi tells us about it huh introducing the Messiah Matthew 24 the opening of the seal to introduce the Messiah arsy headstone that way I can stand with all of the Bible in front of me and declare the cornerstone is the new birth the headstone is the birth of the word all the word so now I'm still saying the same time and I'm asking the question do you have the new birth cause if you don't have the new birth in ain't only the word about to rest in some old musician if you don't have the new birth is no need to worry about it let's get to new birth let's get Jesus Christ into our hearts and then we worry about it you know what these things will become to understanding yeah but I just don't understand well read it but you're gonna read it well yeah mmm and I just don't see that will explain it did the messenger come at the end of the age brother branham said every one of them did so then you know how Paul coming at the end of our of the first Ephesus if you're going that away and you'd have Iranians you'd have all these and you'd wind up in trouble but if you'll take it that's a messenger coming to end of the age all right hey we're gonna get the organ to working tonight huh okay George over here well alright well we'll get it to working well we got plenty of time well I'd worry about it okay what do you see what I'm talking about just think of the messenger come to the end of the age now there's one in here that I didn't get okay let me see if I can find it while they're playing a little bit and getting tuned let me see if I can find it when he begins to say Oh Jude yeah come on where we at well let me just give you this one from the message of the rapture and I must say it and my message all the time knowing back gar under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is and then seven seals opened those mysteries and showing those things is what happened what I'm trying to find it I got it on here where brother Brennan says that the seals come down he said Moses brought two Commandments he calls the commandments the sealed you ever thought of that that's what he says that the commandments and the seals are the same time I wish to God I could get things back in my mind it's a lot of places I wish I could get that one back I saw marriage and divorce in it in the Ten Commandments I could read it I'll read right there this is beautiful in the Ten Commandments what about the first sealed first seal says that that there's just one true and living God right what is the first commandment they hold alizarin Lord our God is one and his name is one but around can make the seals and become the Ten Commandments to be the same thing but see that's where the troubling we think the Ten Commandments is a book of rules it is not is a revelation of Almighty God the Ten Commandments is not a book of rules it's a revelation of Almighty God God in letter form what are the seals revelation of God like I've always asked you to do go home and get that book set down the Luke and just read the books and the titles of the sermons after you get through brother Branham had always preached one true and living God why did he come back in there 63 after the opening of the seals and picked up the greatest message he ever he said it I didn't say he said that was the greatest message then he'd ever preached was Christ a mystery of God reveal read the message and when he did he said it that he said Jesus Christ was Almighty God he'd always taught it to him as I always told here said there the other day he always preached it melts as it was Almighty God go to 57 series of the other of the Hebrews he taught who Melchizedek was but I love what he said later one who is this milk's hesitate oh we know who that ask brother Branham you mean brother Brown was milchester no I don't agree no I don't think so but why would he say who is this bill charity Christ is the mystery of God reveal the future home the unveiling of God goes back a little while after then preaches a message says the mighty God unveiled were in the people Oh see there was a message but Ron's message was the opening of those seven seals that's what he come to brain the other was restoration returned the faith of the father's bringing it back getting it all lined up you had to get that right before he could bring his message that's why he came at the end of the age he said if you make me I'm paraphrasing this from this close we said if you make me the messenger lady of seal makes it us see if you make me the seventh angel door something he said you make me the messenger a lady will see and it's not right he was not to messenger the lady osya he was a messenger to the world during all of that time yes right okay but the Holy Ghost came on a zoo sir Street to fulfill this church age messenger now what about it well you you said you said things that just dumbfounded me just think about it and then come and show me some other way it can be come on don't you think I'm serious don't you think if somebody else challenges that to me that I'll be glad to go if they're off the word I'm not gonna argue with nobody but there's one thing about it I'm gonna stand for this message and believe it cause I've always believed it that way if I'll state it again if the new birth is the birth of the word did were not the headstone message be the birth of the word that a lot had not shined upon until the day the Prophet brought it so you're not leaving him you're trying to pack him in and not leaving him a message that was personal to him he said not in his years of preparation he said when he begins to sound understand well we got rid 596 in spiral [Music] at night I lay in bed at night to cry and - flowers - no exactly why I can explain were Tom the spirit scrubbing
