you'd bless them father be with the missionaries in the foreign field Lord just touch their heart and give them fruit for their labor we ask these blessings in Jesus name amen make that where you can see it in a minute I'd do that now here we go sorry about that that better all right well we could quote this anyway you didn't even need to see it in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 3:3 and Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot enter enter or see or understand the kingdom of God John 16:12 says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now this is Jesus speaking how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whosoever he shall who whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak like I said before he's speaking through the bride and he will show you things to come you may be seing the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're looking toward we're going to stop today and and talk about a couple of things that that we have not really discussed kind of break it down for the morning and then uh uh do a little preaching this afternoon but we we're trying to get to a place of maturity amen every one of us trying to get to a place of maturity we're not you shouldn't be satisfied with where you are you shouldn't be satisfied with what you are all right we're going to be what God told us we're going to we're going to agree with him that we are perfect but on this side looking at us kind of sometimes hard to look in the mirror and say you're a perfect guy come look in my mirror then y'all come look in my mirror and you look and see the same you'll see a person that's not perfect but I'm just going by what God Said but he gave us a way to get there and he said we are going to be changed in the moment in the twinkle of an eye there's somebody that's not going to die somebody is going to tell death you do not have a Hold on Me Anymore all right but it's not going to be a baby driving the car it's going to be a mature bride that knows what to do brother Brown said with the word of God somebody that's studied somebody that's prayed somebody that's read your Bible that that's listening to The Prophet's message that that listens to to sermons and and really get something out of it all right because the Bible tells us the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready now remember the wife made herself ready here yes we're not waiting to get to Perfection that's right Perfection has met us here yes sir all right our white robes are here yes not coming we're not going to receive white robes the day you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost your soul was robed in the robe of righteousness your soul was robed in Perfection you say I can't see it well there's there's a dual thing we got to look at and that's why that we get the statue of perfect man and we'll talk about in just a minute there's a spirit realm of you that's human your soul is obviously the real you but there's a spirit part of you that's human that is a nature that you know we fight it everybody fights who do you fight the most you fight yourself all right but there is a there is a place for us to be there's a place that the prophet of God I believe in the end time that the irenius and and Martin and Luther and different ones they couldn't stand behind the pull pit and say Hey you are The Perfect sinless Bride of Jesus Christ now they may have weaved it in their sermon but they ended it by baptizing people in the name of father son Holy Ghost they ended it by saying let's speak to the Trinity all right so they didn't have everything they were robed but they were robed in their soul all right they they were whest they were white white righteous in their soul but their Humanity their their their Spirit realm is what was controlling or suppressing because of what they heard all right we'll read it in just a minute that's why that the prophet had to come that's why I keep reading it that that there's a the weakness was where ppet weakness was in the ppet but now being that the weakness is in the pet I declare to you today the strength is in the pullet yes sir if it's a truth the strength is in the pull pit and it's out to you making us all stronger taking us somewhere not just you know well it's Sunday well it's Wednesday well it's Bob Bob brother Bob well we love brother Bob but oh my goodness he's been in Hebrews for all this time I wish he'd stay in Hebrews okay I'm 130 something in on the son of man I ain't even got to the son of man yet so we're getting there thank God he give us thank God he give us all this time to get ready but there's one day when he's going to say Hey listen hey I've had enough come on up a little higher there's that call and where's the call coming from is coming from inside you if you have the new birth there has to be a call inside of you all right and we'll talk about that in just for just a minute so the marriage when you become born again you become married you are Ms Jesus Christ right he robes you with righteousness he robes your soul it's just as perfect as God is it has changed into an 18y old kid yes sir I just believe that that's the power that's already laying inside of you if you're born again today already laying inside of you all right but then we got to get that out to the spirit realm because Satan can play in that Spirit realm and and seemingly push push God back into your soul I said seemingly cuz sometimes we feel defeated sometimes we feel like we're not worth anything that's right sometimes we feel like we're not perfect sometimes we feel like well it just ain't worth it it's worth it yes sir we'll talk about that in just a minute cuz I want to break something down for you that we have it done before on you must be born again brother Brown you're still what you are until you're actually born again of the spirit of God you know brother R tells us he said the soul is the nature of the spirit and that really just turns people upside down and and that's where you get your two Soul Doctrine and you you know your spirit overtakes this and any garbage but the soul is the nature of the spirit what if if you today if you love the Lord you come to church you set aside time you're here to to take your memory that you that you have that you have learned from Brother Dale and brother Bob and the different ones brother Aaron Brother Louis and listen to those different ones Hey Brother collie long time ago when he used to do Sunday school class and different ones he used to preach you know you you what you're using your memory yes sir you're you're pulling that out like a computer you've got it stored and you're pulling it out either that or you're sitting here numb are you just sitting here not thinking about nothing how to fix your tractor how to cut your grass one brother told Brother Dell one time said brother Dale said I I didn't I want to be honest he said I didn't hear a thing you said he said but I I figured out how to fix my tractor while I was sitting in church well at least he was honest well praise the Lord I know our mind wanders don't tell me your mind doesn't wander off am I preaching to the right oh brother Anderson's like so the soul is the nature of the spirit your your your spirit your soul feeds off and come it has to come through memory reason it's got to come through that filter all right but now I want to tell you something though when we get to a spot I want you to see something that even brother Dale years ago you know brother Brown said you have one sense in the soul Faith or doubt right five in the memory reason conscious affection in imagination five in the in the natural realm he taste Phil smon here but inside you you have either God or the devil that's it all right but he had never dawned on him till he was and we'll read it here in just a minute when brother R went across a curtain of time he was in his theophany he was in his soul that was eternal and he he had met people that their soul was eternal and they spoke to him they had memory of him they were conscious that he we'll read it here in just a few minutes when he went across a curtain of time so so when brother how went across a curtain of time it wasn't just his soul and it's like hanging up in the closet no no no he has fresh memory reason conscious effects and Imagination and I don't think his memory is completely blank to what he was on Earth wasn't to brother brandom it wasn't to those people they said hey you're you were a leader they had their memory reason but it was way bigger way more expanded than what ours is cuz we have that thing like brother Bob said you know well that brother did this to me and that listen we when across the curtain of time them brothers weren beating each other to death Tred to get the Brother brandom come on somebody them sisters wasen going I got to him first no they said my precious brother and they came in order and ran and hugged his neck so the new birth is an experience so you've got to experience it here but where does it take place the new birth takes place in your soul and then it works its way out through the memory reason but then Satan because of the Fall he has access to work this way right into that memory reason conscious affection imagination and mess you up or try to mess you up listen he can't make your soul listen to me he can't make your soul sin you're a free moral agent but if you're a Christian today your soul can't sin you say brother R says I sin every day you sin in your spirit realm every day listen I sin because I don't let my soul take over that's my sin my sin is unbelief that's why brother Brown said that's all sin was was unbelief listen to the inside the new birth is an experience something takes place so it's not in other words it's not the what we always thought was a new birth was that now I get this new feeling now I get this new emotion now I get this now that's not it it's what it's Jesus Christ personally coming to you his person coming to your person cleaning out your person not destroying you you're still a human not destroying you but he comes dwells inside of you he loves something about you cuz he said this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to dwell God Don't Lie God does not lie he can't lie if he come on the day of Pentecost and told them hey I'm pleased to dwell in those 120 people came to Jesus on the River Jordan by type and said I'm pleased to dwell in that human vessel what about me and you yes the day you got born again God said hey I love that guy I love that sister but I don't like their ways so I'm going to send Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists see see you can go the other way and you can say well if my soul is already perfect if I'm already redeemed why do I need you why do I need to study cuz that Soul inside of you wants out he's wanting to work in your memory reason conscious affection imagination so the preaching of the word is for what driving out unclean spirits the only way you can cast out a devil really is by the word of God all right cuz Satan can't cast out Satan and you can't say well well I'm going to just you know do like the Catholic Church you're going to put the water on you and throw stuff at you and all that stuff you can't do that you preach the word of God and make that devil so so you don't want to live there anymore but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you so we have become powerless without the new birth and then we were talking about a permitted power power was given what given to Satan to do what it was given to Satan to do one thing one thing and that's keep you from getting born again you say no it's it's this it's pornography it's this is it no it's the keep you from being born again if he keep you from being born again he's got all the other stuff that's right that's why brother R said the new birth right he said sin is unbelief yes listen your person today your person your soul is believing or not believing if you're a non-believer you're just sitting here I did that for years as a young kid but Power was given well so do y'all well after your birth you're just dead I mean you're dead all the way around right that's why it's so important that's why I'll read this quote where brother M talks about your Soul's worth 10,000 worlds I'll read it here in just a minute because we're going to get into the soul and separated just a little bit more than we did the other day but now remember where in Revelation s you look at we're going to get into the seals here pretty quick where do these white horse riders come from and where did they go where did they come from they come from you white righteous a hores a power and when brother randam broke that seal open when God broke that seal to brother brandham Satan had to what ride away he had to ride off he had to get away from that word that brother randam was preaching he had to get away from it that's why you and I that's why I said let out what you are either you got those and you realize you got them or you realize you've got the lion ox man and Eagle inside and let that do the work so we want the horses I don't care what color they are we want them to ride away from us yes sir all right because we are a white righteous bride that's going to ride on a white horse but now remember not to battle no no no we come back Revelations 19 Victorious riding on White Horse with a man leading us and said word of God down his thigh guess what all of us have the word of God down our thigh as we come out but that per that power was permitted to do one thing and that was that was almost to see the very elect but it was to make it was to show that God knew what he was doing come on by in just instead of just saying okay your soul is yeah yeah you're it you day of Pentecost all right Peter you ain't got to do nothing else now you're done you're you're sealed not what it do to Peter it really unsealed who Peter was they came out of a sealed door opened up the sealed windows huh all that they were sealed up they were scared about once they received this dunamis or this power then what did that first thing they did they run outside and said hey this is that brother M tells us that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church now look come to the church church not the not not come into the bar rooms and not come into the church this is all the devil's worried about he's not worried about them guys out there he's worried about you and he's really worried cuz remember we have his answer we know how to handle him now we're supposed to be able to and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless by doing what saying well come shake my hand and you're born again come and say three hell marries and you're born again come and let me sprinkle you and you're born again oh it doesn't matter you could W you're not perfect and I'm not perfect you can't live that life they're exactly right but if you got somebody inside of you he can live that life if we'll just let him out Church age book says Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth he's talking about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and and the trinitarian doctrine that's all false when they were blinded to it Who blinded them the preachers the priest they blinded the people the pope it wasn't long to the Church of Rome stop baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Revelations 2:6 but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians that word hatest means detest God detests false Doctrine which also detest he said in other words there was a group of people that stood one day and said hey I don't believe that sthus guy I don't believe that false teaching over here from brother so and so and brother so and so everybody with me Revelations 2:4 but it keeps going to another church age I have a few things against it because they they hold you hold the doctrine there are them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught balb to cast a stum block before the children of Israel same thing in the message to today to eat things sacrificed into idols and commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine so now it's come to a doctrine of the nicians look which things I hate he said repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth which is the word Resurrection 1953 brother R says see I don't want to blame you people it's the pull pits where it started no wonder that's the damn of the country when Satan got in the pull pit that's the truth failing to preach what the UN unadulterated word of God or a furtherment of the Gospel I'm saying statue of perfect man growth development not just that you got it and just you're here no failing to preach the unadulterated word of God and the word of God will what produce just exactly what it said it would do I say to you today hang on this thing will produce itself it'll have to produce itself but we explain it all the way it's all way that's for some other day no it's for here 1964 talking about Satan got a hold of the Masterpiece in the Garden of Eden but praise God the great sculptor he started back what he started back with that foundation and then he's building a stature of a perfect he's building a bride like I'm going to tell you in a few minutes that is that can withstand all this yes there's some that couldn't they couldn't withstand that do listen that doctrine of father son Holy Ghost come from the pits of Hell brother B said but they received that and they took it into their person not their soul but they took it into their being and preached it Satan was doing all that God never preached a trinitarian Doctrine see that's something it's hard for us to understand that how Luther can be born again that's why a lot of people thought he wasn't Lutheran can be born again sealed perfect in his soul got a white robe but then he could preach a trinitarian Doctrine which didn't come from there it come from his person it come from his personality it came from what Satan could play with his memory reason conscience reasoning you still got reasoning though you're born again still got reasoning still got memory reason conscious all these different things we'll talk about that in just a minute then we come to a place where brother R had to divide this out and remember look this is on the first seal so on the very first seal he is setting a a precedence I am talking to the bride only because those white horse riders folks that was in the church of his day he was dealing with it he could see it amen those Pentecostals that could live like the devil out out there and come into church and speak in tongues and interpretation and sound like Angels he said he knew where that horse was come truth he had problem with that horse well but he did where did it ride away from him cuz he preached several times a mighty conqueror back in the late 50s he preached out of Revelation 6 that that white horse rider was somebody sitting on it was a holy ghost down through the church he told you that well that was false all right but he had to come to a truth and he did praise God for the open of these seals he said for all the different doctrines that he had already preached he he preached serpent seed he preached all these different doctrines why am I against organized religion why am I against this then he comes up in 1963 at the seals he said now I know why I hated that system so much now I know why that that white horse rider was not Christ he was the Antichrist so we come to a spot where brother man says hey I'm talking to the bride only remember he said this is that third pull who is it to the bride church and totally lost well in other words he was separating each one so that we would understand and listen because if you get caught in the church you could be a foolish virgin but you can't be bride that's why I call you bride that you'll understand do you understand today that you're bride oh I think I'll just make it as a foolish virgin no you won't foolish virgin somebody haven't been taught we can't plead that sorry right and then never since Jesus Christ on Earth I was thinking about this even yesterday a formidable opponent I was if you look on YouTube it's kind of well that's not really funny but you remember who Mike Tyson is you know he's he was this bad guy and I mean he can knock you out in about 10 seconds well there was this one guy I mean he was cocky and he was pointing fingers and he you know you're out of here I'm I've got you and he was this much taller than him than Tyson they went out there and the baell went Ding and 8 seconds later that guy was knocked completely out he hit him one time that's the way the devil ought to be he thinks we're so little and so insignificant you just wait he now has a formidable opponent if he tells you this you say no that's not right if he tells you this no that's not right if he tells you this no that's not right confuse him he's confused us long enough let's confuse him tired of that being confused confused we're all confused unless we have good teaching and a mature Ministry Amen brother R said look there's been bride there's been churches churches Brides Bri now see there's been Brides down through the church AG but remember when when a bride marriage and divorce when a when a the bride commits adultery against a groom he can put her away and marry another right according to the Bible and in type that's what happened the the Pentecostals the Baptist the meth they were bride and there's some bride in there but but they the word didn't go on further they took on that denominational idea and God had to put them away I'm divorcing you remember he divorced Israel in the Old Testament he can do that yes but he's got a bride in every Church age right and he sure got a bride in this age cuz he said right here but there's got to come one you see how he's honing this thing down as that pyramid hones down everything's being honed down to just a small group of people that's going to really receive this and carry it on to the coming of the Lord but there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride now not the other Brides were false they were false bride but they weren't that false being not born again there must come one that's got not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics now what's the mechanics the mechanics is the word of God and then the Dynamics is the spirit on the word of God everybody with me right quickening what you heard according to the mechanics that Dynamic Sparks what's inside that engine everybody with me all right we've got an engine we've had maybe the the mechanics all these years we've had the the the workings of the word of God you know the cylinders and the valves and the cam shaft and all the different things we got that but without a spark without fuel it just sit there and it right but with the Dynamics in it carry us down the road see is what until we come to that place until we find that place place what good is it to just polish the hubs we're talking about love the token the other Sunday full obedience now look the brides down through the church Ages were not fully obedient the first church ages maybe but then it got eroded like I said before like like like God told us said I have something against you you've accepted these false doctrines these Deeds now the doctrines you've accepted them and I've had to put you away that didn't mean that there was not born again Believers don't ever think that there are going to be way more in the church ages behind us than they are us cuz remember this is what honing time but full obedience look to the full word of God they didn't have the full word of God they thought they did Luther thought he did Wesley thought they did but they did not but now we have the full word of God so that entitles us to the Token what does it do that token keeps us from death they died in the Old Testament they died in the old church ages they died in part of this church age but the full word entitles us to that token that went over the door that not only saved our soul but it's going to change our body yes sir amen that's the full word of God entitles us to this token and what happened when that token was applied right no Death Angel and they got to leave the next morning remember after the doorpost they went out the next day next morning look not what somebody has put into it and added to it right but what God said about it Ephesians 4:29 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption now hold that thought because we're going to talk about that in just a few minutes because brother Ram told us it what he's a very timid holy spirit is very Tim you know what he does he'll set in your soul come on he'll set in your soul and let you do something wrong to see what you'll do even brother BR said he'll have one brother say something against you to see how you'll react now that sounds a little that sounds a little like provoking but no it's proving it's proving who you are we are going to prove who we are sir you're not going to be able to help it you're going to prove who you are you know why by Who You Are all right and how we react as brother B was talking about brotherly kindness and all these different things you just don't see that much there's not if you take brotherly kindness and run it right down just like I did the other day and let brother Bob did there's really not a lot of people that has brotherly kindness see the holy spirit is so timid how many knows that just real timid so he's just going to sit there he's going to wait on you brother Ram said he'll go out on a limb he don't go out of your he don't go out of your body and go sit on the limb of a tree but in figurative he does you know but that's the only thing brother Brown could use as a as a example was that he withdraws himself until you get yourself straightened out you know why because that thing that thing this is your soul that thing can't stand sin that's why when you do do something wrong and something goes shouldn't have done that then we wait a little bit later and like brother Dell says we make it your fault no I'm like brother Bob if I've said anything to offend you forgive me I really really don't want anything against me if we have to go across that other across that curtain of time brother Bram said death does what doesn't change you changes your Dwelling Place if you Harbor feelings here how you going to go there can't do it so any Interruption bothers him I why we don't talk all in church all as you know just a a you know hello brother God bless you or changing of the tombs or whatever up here but no no conversation man you go to B to church we went to one not very long ago year or so ago and it was just like a lodge you walked in the back and they're leaning up against you know the Leaning up inside right here and they're talking back and forth and everybody's Milling around talking it's just it sounds like Walmart you know just you hear voices and then about 5 minutes before the 6:00 service starts they just kind of start migrating into a seat somewhere they never prayed they never done anything they talking about everything in the world well now okay where was the Holy Ghost it was grieving the ones of us that did have it when we walked in the door did it grieve them I'm not saying they don't have the Holy Ghost but it didn't grieve them because their Doctrine said they could do that that's right that's the doctrine God hates that's why brother Bram said make it cold formal and Powerless cuz he's not even in those denominations anymore he's trying to pull people out yes they will be foolish virgins yes there'll be people given eternal life but there are no bride in the denominational system well I say Amen because look at it look at it but God promised he would restore how's he going to restore he's going to restore through a Ministry five-fold Ministry that gives it to the people and then they eat and become what that Ministry talks about and you go through all these stages let's just get through that because you know what metamorphis I want to start right here let's talk about your soul just for a minute put everything away put the chicken away Bob just had to say mashed potatoes put the mashed potatoes away put some macaron and cheese away that's three favorites so put them away let's talk about this just for a minute then we'll eat all that when we go downstairs all right God says behold look All Souls are mine he didn't say all Spirits he didn't say all bodies he said All Souls are mine right all right as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine then he sums this whole thing up and says the soul that sinth it shall die didn't say the body didn't say the spirit said the soul that s it now what is a soul let's look at the Hebrew Lex we've been through this many many times before we got some new ones and we got some that need to really hear this I need to really hear it cuz I'm the one that put it in here just a few minutes ago cuz I thought man I need to listen to this too your soul is yourself now look hold on just a minute there's a spirit of humanity all right there's a spirit because animals have a spirit they can function they see taste feel smell hear they have memory they have reason conscious affection but not in the soul everybody with me because they can't per it's not a person it's not an individual to me uh you look at deer and you look at all that that's nature that's God that's God's nature moving through animals and he said it was good in the Garden of Eden they can procreate and it's good but me and you can't just procreate anytime we want to cuz we have a soul there's something that's going to be judged those animals are never going to be judged never will they be judged all right the reason they are what they are now cuz they're eating each other and getting killed on the highways because of who you when Adam fell everything above look when Adam fell now this is not Christ I mean but Adam was the Apex he was The Headstone of the human race amen he fell CU he wasn't the savior of the human race but he was the head of the human race he had power on everything on Earth he had power he was given that power but he traded it to save his bride okay Jesus Christ same way he had power over everything and he give it away to get his prde then he's the only one that can save us and he's the only one can come back up and say all power in Heaven and Earth given unto me he goes right back to being the headstone again cuz remember he was the Chief Cornerstone to build the human race to build us the bride he became down here that was that was cut off that was done away with they rejected the man standing there that could save them all yes but there's a group of people that's going to be his body his bride body that he's going to build and then he's going to be happy to be in us and sit right down on top of us all right be our head praise the Lord so let's look at this just for a minute strong concordance soul is self life creature person appetite mind living being desire emotion and and passion all right now look that which breathes the breathing substance being Soul the inner being of a man now when a soul leaves a man what happens he quits breathing and you look and and I want to try to explain this and not not hurt anybody's feelings because death is not a good thing as far as the way we look at it because it's a separation it's a gap we've all you know we're intertwined together and we've we' we you I've been with Brother house since since I was about eight or nine years old and we fished and we hunted we all went to to the uh fishing thing um with the Father's day but that part's gone that part's gone never to come back like that again okay but now look that which breathes the breathing substance when brother how was was passing from this life to the next life something happened in his body to release that Soul what happens when somebody dies they die because they can't keep their soul inside their body that not what death is your soul leaves your body because there's something I am now functioning my soul is functioning my body is functioning and my spirit's functioning because everything's working together everybody with me don't go to sleep this is your soul it's worth 10,000 words worlds words and worlds but something inside of you has has stopped when your heart stops your soul leaves your body right when you stop breathing when you can't breathe when different things happen to you that's why that soul is so important but it's also important to make sure you keep the other guy outside Guy Healthy too I know you know bodily exercise doesn't profit much but it does help to do a little bit to keep that thing back together right sister Ruth she said praise the Lord but living being living being look with life in the blood I keep going the man himself so he the the definition has come to because a living being is a is a deer a deer is a living being but it's not a living person all right it's not something that you named well some we do name our pets so but it's a living being with life in the blood but it's not a man it's not himself it's not a person it's not an individual it's the seed of your appetite it is seed of emotions and passions look activity of mind all right activity of the will so see that stops all animals animals do not have a will they are controlled by Nature they do the same thing all the time unless we mess it up and build a road through their hunting property where they go hunting at that's why we hit a lot of deer and things and kill them the activity of the will look activity of the character you know you you look at a little dog and a little dog he'll develop some kind of a little character but he's not a person he's not going to look at you one day and say no I don't want to do that but now you're kid when it's born it's going to look at you one day and say no I don't want to do that right somebody said one day said you know um um a little bitty small kitten will walk across this right here like this and look over that way and look over that way and walk around never will fall off but you put a baby right here that baby going to fall off all right so there but so but what I'm saying is that they're controlled by a nature that's that's a little different than ours we've got to develop one that cat can jump move all those other animals they can do things superhuman sometimes and then the baby's like help me you know so it's the activity of a character so watch this this is brother brandom now now we're look we're talking about Saul Now what went across the curtain of time when brother Brown said I stepped across the curtain of time he said I looked back and saw what my body and it was moving so it wasn't dead right it it was moving he made that pretty plain it was moving all right so when he stepped across a curtain of time what was what stepped across it was the real himym his soul but when he stepped across that curtain of time like I said before he wasn't just something that you hang up in the closet and wait till the other parts come together no he had memory reason conscious effects in imagination all those people had memory reason conscious goes watch this and the voice that was above me said this is something like Jacob when he had gathered with his people just then I looked and men were coming oh by the groups knocking each other out of the way and no by the groups brotherly kindness millions of them oh my and they were running throwing their arms around me and screaming my precious brother they knew who he was and my you know I was married before and my wife died Billy's mother that's the reason Billy and I stick together together she died when he was 18 months old his little sister was 8 months old she died with the mother I've been popping Mama to Billy and I seen hope coming working her way through the crowd now he is standing in his theophany is everybody with me he's standing in his soul and his soul is going that's my wife right he's thinking that's my wife she's on this side heading toward him not saying that's my husband cuz she had broke through he was he was kind of in between she had broke through and was completely in this realm but she knew he was a brother and she had no problem brother rown said she did what oh I thought surely she'll call me her husband and when she got close to me see I could see her bless her heart blackhair German girl you know black hair she threw her arms around me she said my darling brother I thought I don't understand this there's another woman just a girl put her arms around me and said my precious brother and she hugged this woman and said think of it look now look think of it he's finally arrived with us they must have knew he was coming he finally arrived with us these men they picked me up so they knew who brother randam was they picked him up and set me upon a little place like this I said why is this he said in Earth you was a leader I said I don't understand it just then the voice spoke to me said this is when you gather with your people I said when I die you mean this is what I'll be yes I said oh why do I ever fear this this is wonderful oh my just perfection that won't reach it superb that wouldn't reach it there's not words in the English dialect that could reach it God knows why I'm telling this from my heart it happened so those people were aware with with their senses but they must have known in their self who brother brandham was cuz they came there under his ministry cuz I I cut some of that out but brother BR said are these all Broms uh he's the voice said no no no these are your con your converts not Paul's not Peters not Billy Graham not all Roberts these are your converts in other words they heard his message and accepted God accepted Christ as their savior under his ministry and they knew that he's finally arrived they've been looking for him that's it the soul yes brother Brown tells us I don't have this I'm just going to read it 1957 I already shut my computer and I pulled this off but brother Brown says look says come right here people are coming from the balcony they may be coming to an altar this altar I want them to come right on I'm waiting for you my dear friend oh this little body of yours is not worth much but that Soul's worth 10,000 worlds now listen to what he says though this is healing on a higher level this is eternal healing he talking about your new birth Eternal healing is a healing of the Soul you don't have to do that by one time cuz it continues on he said look if a man gets healed here at the platform he's going to get sick again if he lives long enough but if a man gets saved he's got everlasting life and will raise up in the last day there's your difference this is eternal healing he said this is eternal I believe he said this is eternal healing this is temporary healing all right now listen One Soul worth 10,000 world then God said All Souls are mine I'm here to protect cuz what's going to go to the day of judgment sure listen we're not but the ones that do have to go to judgment their soul everything they got goes there but God's going to judge their soul because their soul emanated out through their come on somebody through their spirit in their body and it made them react in a way not godly but it all emanated from the soul all right now I know there's a lot we can talk about there but the soul is the most important thing I know brother R said you can go completely back crazy in your mind and commit suicide and your soul still be born again now remember that all right but I want you to realize something be careful with that look at the life we all have issues and problems we all let Devils get on us am I preaching to the same crown we all that demons get a hold of us sometimes but you need to get rid of that thing in the name of the Lord Jesus you don't exactly have to call the pastor you don't exactly have to call a deacon you exactly have that in your hole right here and that hole called a mouth but it comes from whatever's inside now remember if Satan's inside here he can't cast himself out that's why brother rown said they'll say Jesus Jesus and not get anything cuz Jesus wasn't in their soul he wasn't you become an anointed one then an anointed one now let's talk about that just for a second before we get to this an anointed one what happens to him his soul has not been converted all right but he has been anointed he has entered a realm of God that God make listen God makes these promises by my stripes your heal that's to everybody Sinner and Saint brother B He he'll tell tell you he said Sinners will come by this platform and get healed and he said Saints will not get healed why because the Saints going oh I did this I did this to my neighbor and all but a prostitute just walked up and said hey I believe what that guy says I believe what that guy says if he says I'm Healed then I'm Healed and listen God's Got A Healer right so you enter in listen that to me anointing ones is temporary we've been talking about it Anor ones is temporary but when you're the soul inside of you is God that's not an anointing that's the birth that's where you're sealed until the day of your Redemption that's where God Burns you out and puts him in think about it think about what God did for you he gave you a new heart we've been talking about that he softens you up why so that he can that the timid Holy Spirit can enter in you can't forget he's not timid all the time he is timid all the time right so that's why this is important when we read second Peter 1 he's talking to your soul all right is everybody with me Peter's talking to the soul of man cuz you don't get the divine nature and divine power in your spirit Realm he's talking to your soul and Peter's a real good one to do that cuz he's he knows one thing on that day of Pentecost something got burned out of him and something got put in him amen so what better preacher that could go that went through all these emotions cursing and and you know all those things and then now he's trying to teach us how to have the divine nature of God grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according to his divine power his soul the soul of God ha given unto us all things that pertain unto what life and godliness how through the knowledge of him that had called it who called you Jesus Christ called you to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises what you might be divine look be partakers of what someone's divine nature you were not born with a divine nature you were born with a nature all right God gave you a soul permitted you to come here to give you a choice everybody with me but that you might be what partakers we can stand up here all day and talk about that good mashed potatoes and that good um chicken and all that good stuff downstairs and you you know what if you're not allowed to go down there and eat it you just going to sit here and die but we can talk about it all we want to Talk's cheap when it's on paper you got to make it live Listen White paper's cheap and black Ink's cheap but when you got to make it live yes we going to go St downstairs and eat whereby are given unto us look at seed and great and precious promises that by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature look having escaped you were bound you were in prison yes you were incarcerated you were put in the pawn shop you were dead you've escaped that how you had a nature change you had the devil's nature thrown out thrown out and God's nature put in that's what you have with a new birth you've escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust you've escaped going to judgment why because God's going to judge a soul right All Souls are mine it's the soul that sent us that dies right so he's judging souls he can't judge yours if you're born again cuz it's him that's right it's so much him brother said one time it's so much him till you're exed out that's right I mean you're completely gone the life that I now live I live by what the faith of the Son of God that's right we must have the mind of Christ our problem is is we try to use ours a lot Romans 8:14 for as many as are Liv by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that's what I was telling yesterday you know we weren't just celebrating a life yesterday yesterday we were celebrating a Son of God born again baptized with the Holy Ghost Son of God celebrating that life yes sure we talked about but see in all of our everything that we talked about about brother how it all culminated in that he was born again yes that's what I was telling him I said you can say all the good sto I said it would be a different I didn't say this but it' be a different story if he was a rank Center come on it would oh yeah you could have real happy this and happy that but not somebody that held that people could say that work with him all those years that never seen a man like that Christian man oh yeah listen there people in that building that probably said I remember when brother Hal got mad and throwed something so what that's a human part oh you don't do that well you need to go to another church church and I don't think you're going to be able to find it cuz we do have issues we're not going to get into it we may get into it this afternoon when you come out of that Spirit realm is where you have your issues cuz listen one more time if your soul is the soul of God how can it have issues God don't have issues issues means problems we used to say it when we when we was at the chicken plant they say look don't say ever say problem say issues it's the same thing we have issues that means we have problems but look brother how was a Son of God because of the new birth not really because he was a human daddy that's the human part that's what I want to tell you over here in the human part separate that part he was a daddy to Janet and and uh Debbie right but in his soul he was a Son of God child of God yes and he received the spirit of adoption when he got born again but he didn't come to it am I with me sorry I man when you can't be adopted in heaven can't be adopted in in heaven you got to have these virtues why Peter stood one day and he said add to your faith right here yes sir right now add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance here yes in other words your walk Peter said our walk has got to be the Walk of that man that I walked with for three and a half years and didn't understand him but I want to be like Peter I really do I really do cuz Jesus looked at Peter and said Peter I prayed for you I know Satan going to sift you like s cuz of your nature Satan's going to bother you because of who you are so I'm going to pray for you I'm going to let you know you may not know it now but I know in my mind from back before the foundational world you're going to preach a sermon in second Peter there's going to be a sermon preach that's going to help not just your little handful but thousands and millions of people wow and Peter's going I fight for you Lord I didn't even understand what he and Jesus I'm praying for Peter I know what you're going to do you're going to cuss three times you're going to deny me that you don't even know me come on and you going to come up and get all full of yourself and you going to take this sword instead of this sword you going to take and whack that guy's ear off but I prayed for you Peter I prayed for you put your name in there for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry father father in other words your soul is redeemed you've rece you you're into the family of God now listen as brother Dell said many many years ago Satan I mean God does not adopt Satan's kids so you got to get into the family before you can get adopted all right that's why we'll read here this afternoon that your adoption and your birth is two different things now you receive the spirit of adoption you're Peter you're in line but you got to get get in the family Peter you're in line I'm going to use you I'm going to pray for you but until you get the Holy Ghost you're not my kingdom listen only kingdom of God is the people the the the children of God right which you have received the spirit of adoption Spirit itself look bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God now this is Peter talking the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together we're still now remember look now we're still in the soul because when you become born again you're a newborn babe the Bible says in Christ but listen that's why I wanted to pull this apart a little bit we'll stop right here and we'll just pick it up this afternoon when you're born again in your soul I believe God changes your soul to an 18y old child person person do I get an amen you not believe I do listen that's my hope that's my driving force that there's something inside of me different than what it was before and the life that I now live yes but that newborn babe is the second real your Soul's not a baby Hey listen even in that whole analogy there with brother Bram going across a curtain of time in another Vision that he had he saw who Sharon Rose Sharon Rose was six months old when she died brother M said who are you she was a grown woman we're not going to have babies running around in heaven nothing against children you have them down here brother call laugh you have them down here but you want to grow up too don't you brother that's right you want to grow up but as newborn babes that's what we'll get to this afternoon when you come when you become born again you you're an 18y old person and listen the only thing that's hindering you is what the next realm your spirit realm your your spirit realm is a baby you have a birth you have a birth it's God birth it's got to work its way listen you're contrary to God the Bible says you're born contrary to God so it and it doesn't I I just wish it changed my spirit realm but it is now through a journey of tests and trials tribulations why so that we can love God more so we can love God more that he took us from a baby where we didn't know how to excuse me we didn't know how to handle that soul that was inside of us cuz we weren't born with that kind of a person we were born with a nature of whatever you got contrary to God now that Bible didn't the Bible is contrary there's nothing about you good until you're born again nothing about you nothing so now you've went through your life being worthless but you get up to whatever age you got the new birth you get the new birth well now listen your body is not going to automatically get younger I wish you would your body's not going to automatically get younger and your spirit realm's not going to know how to handle that new person inside of you so the newborn babe part Desiring the sensor milk of the word that what that you may grow not that you get now brother Ram had to give us an analogy we'll close right here he said it's like a little button remember didn't you remember that it's like a little button that comes into you at a new birth and then it grows well I I I believe that but that was his analogy of trying to tell you that your second realm was so much against it still am I with we are we okay that Spirit realm didn't know how don't know how to handle that soul and that's where the fight is that's where the newborn babe is the newborn babe is the second realm guy listen how can you have God inside of you and then him not be all knowing God's all knowing all the time and the part that you get of him is not less knowing that's why musicians come that's why we have had so much trouble since the day of Pentecost we have not been able to realize the Body Spirit soul and their function even Paul tells us he said I wish that your whole body Soul and Spirit be sanctified got to start somewhere though got to start by a new birth that's why they call it new new birth right new born babes you don't know how to handle this new birth this new thing you got inside of you cuz listen you were dead and lost now you're healed and eternal in your soul can't have a new thought can't change or it's not God everybody with me so where is the change part it's in the spirit realm we'll talk about that that's where you're a newborn babe cuz you take a you take a person that let's wait do this afternoon we'll we let's sing a song we'll do it this afternoon it'll take too long to explain that but a newborn baby Desiring the Sens milk of the word what's happening is that Dynamo that's inside of you that soul that now is all of God and you together vulcanized and when he vulcanized remember what happens can't tell the difference can't pull them apart your body and spirit is learning how to deal with that let's stand to our feet did everybody believe that I mean I I don't want you to not believe that that's what your soul is eternal so how are you going to take your body and your spirit that's not Eternal and mesh that thing together so that it fires all the time the same way it's by the word of God and it's by listening and it's by studying and it's by praying God I know you're in here come on God I know you're in here I know you want to get out let it out help me to change my memories and conscious effects and Imagination help me oh what a change in my life since when since God came in let's sing a song God bless you oh me more like the Jesus me is that your desire let's worship him just for a moment you don't have to go get something to eat you're here you can eat here has filed with love and made me more like the live your life through me your desire your life through me is that your desire do you want him to live through you live your life through me and give me a heart that fil with your love and make me more sing it to him one more time oh make me more like thee Oh me more like thee Jesus made me more like the is that your desire oh give me a heart that's filed with love and made me more like thee is that your desire make me more like thee cuz we're born contrary but when you get the new birth you get that little spark that you need start listening to that listen if it leads you in wrong it ain't God pretty simple that's why I believe we have Satan's answer cuz see Satan would say no well that's that that's you know you no we know what happens in the soul we know what happens in the spirit realm we know how they're connected by our natural environment right but if you're born again in your soul folks Satan can't touch your soul he cannot touch your soul that's one thing he can't get his grimy hands on he cannot get his grimy hands on your soul if he touches your soul it's going to be hotter than he'll ever get in hell right cuz you're a Dynamo that's the Eternal that's the man that created the world living inside of you sometimes we we belittle the new birth that we have it's the greatest thing brother R said you'll ever have is to get born again and then let that life out even the Bible tells us is why hide it under a bushel why hide it in a basket let it out let's sing it one more time live your life through me is that your desire Jesus live your life through me and give me a heart that f with love and make me more like the heavenly father Lord thank you for this day you've give us thank you for the brothers and sisters that's assembled today Lord we pray now that as we go and eat a natural meal that you'll continue to be speaking to us Lord and that you'll help us through into the second service Lord for your people father I pray that you'd sanctify the food that we're about to partake of Lord as we go downstairs and and just EA a natural meal Lord I pray that you'd be with us and sanctify us Lord as we partake and come back with us Lord there at 2:00 and Lord just be with us in the communion in foot washing today Lord what a wonderful time today we'll have so I pray that You' just do that father in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed everyone eat now everyone stay and eat good God is so good he so good to me oh my God he is so good yes God is so good oh yes God is so good he's so good to me and I love him so much oh I love him so much yes I love him so he's so good to me and he answers prayer oh yes he answers my prayer yes he answers my prayer he's so good to me
