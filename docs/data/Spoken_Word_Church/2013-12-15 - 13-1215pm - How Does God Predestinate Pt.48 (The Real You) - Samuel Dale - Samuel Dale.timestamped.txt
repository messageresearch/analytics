[28:22] to see everybody in the house of the
[28:23] Lord if you'd like to turn back in your
[28:24] scriptures turn where we was reading
[28:26] this morning from Romans
[28:28] 8 and
[28:30] Ezekiel
[28:33] 18 just remember the announcements that
[28:35] they will not be able to service here on
[28:37] December the 25th because that's on
[28:39] Wednesday and then we will be having a
[28:42] watch Night Service on Tuesday which is
[28:46] the 31st and then there will not be any
[28:49] Services here on the first day of
[28:53] January which would be the Wednesday
[28:55] because we' be so close in there with
[28:56] the time so just remember that remember
[28:59] each one remember sisters if you want to
[29:01] bring some stuff for finger food where
[29:03] we can eat and fellowship together and
[29:05] come a little early and we generally get
[29:07] here in the afternoon we start at 8:00
[29:10] but we generally get here in the
[29:12] afternoon and you know and have a little
[29:14] time together and fellowship and too uh
[29:16] make sure you get you up a special
[29:19] because brother might not preach that
[29:20] long I don't know how long he does
[29:22] preach but we always you know have it
[29:24] early and get started and then that way
[29:27] we can have singing testimony meeting or
[29:29] whatever you want to have give a little
[29:31] testimony or whatever if you got it then
[29:34] be ready to give it there on the watch
[29:36] Night Service okay just remember these
[29:39] things I think that's all remember
[29:40] Wade's up at brother Tom kain's and
[29:44] probably through on the way back home by
[29:46] now so remember them traveling to the
[29:48] mountains there okay Romans 8 and
[29:53] Ezekiel 18 father we thank you for the
[29:56] grace and love that you have bestowed
[29:58] upon
[29:59] us to be able to say that we are the
[30:02] children of God what a great
[30:05] opportunity world a world of
[30:07] Christianity confesses that today but
[30:10] really is it a truth from their heart or
[30:14] is it that their mouth is just saying it
[30:16] and and their actions and reactions is
[30:20] hypocritical in that they're not doing
[30:21] it then then that would be a split
[30:23] condition Lord as we were reading or
[30:25] talking about this morning and father we
[30:28] don't want to be a hypocrite we want to
[30:29] be what you want us to be we ask you to
[30:32] just forgive our sins and guide us in
[30:34] your grace keep each and every one of us
[30:36] Lord remember the sick among us reach
[30:38] down and touch each one father because
[30:41] we believe you we love you and we thank
[30:43] you we commit it to you now in Jesus
[30:45] name amen amen Romans
[30:51] 8 and we know that all things work
[30:54] together for good to them that love God
[30:56] to them who are the called Accord
[30:57] according to his purpose for whom he did
[31:00] for know he also did predestinate to be
[31:04] conformed to the image of his son that
[31:06] he might be the firstborn among many
[31:08] Brethren moreover whom he did
[31:11] predestinate them he also called and
[31:13] whom he called them he also Justified
[31:16] and whom he justified them he also
[31:19] glorified what shall we then say to
[31:21] these things if God be for us who can be
[31:25] against us all right let's go over to
[31:30] Ezekiel watch me I pull my thing out
[31:32] while I
[31:33] go I'll have to find
[31:40] it I pulled out my card one Ago by
[31:44] accident
[31:47] okay says
[31:50] behold All Souls are
[31:53] mine as the soul of the father so also
[31:56] the soul of the son is mine
[31:58] the soul that
[32:00] sinth it shall die you may be seated the
[32:03] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[32:05] the word now we'll try to take up where
[32:10] we left off this
[32:13] morning not background much but want to
[32:16] continue on in the thought of we're
[32:20] talking about what is a
[32:23] soul and we we got into the point there
[32:25] of talking about the about es and
[32:28] there's a lot of quotes to it but
[32:31] talking about the soul the prophet said
[32:34] is the nature of the
[32:36] spirit all right now to take that as I
[32:40] said this morning without following
[32:42] through on the Bible and understanding
[32:46] The Prophet's message and the doings you
[32:49] could just make it any kind of a nature
[32:51] of something just you know a bird dog
[32:54] has a nature to be a bird dog it's it's
[32:56] not like an old hound it's
[32:58] it points it does it don't have to be
[33:00] trained to do those things it does it
[33:04] automatically right and you can say well
[33:06] that's just the nature of that
[33:08] dog well that's true and that's doing
[33:11] and and you look at a person as they're
[33:13] doing and and you can say well I can
[33:16] recognize that uh father of that child
[33:19] because uh the child Walks Like acts
[33:22] like the father all right but that's
[33:25] just the nature part that's just
[33:28] something that's motivating you I'm
[33:31] trying to get you to a point and I to
[33:33] think about you know what a soul really
[33:37] is we gave the definition this morning
[33:40] it's a person it's
[33:42] being all right we talked about this
[33:45] morning the fact of Soul and Spirit
[33:47] being an interchangeable word all right
[33:51] but I just looking while ago because I
[33:53] had I had you know I was thinking about
[33:55] it and psalmist David
[33:58] says three times my soul
[34:00] thirsteth after
[34:03] thee or for thee whatever see and I just
[34:06] run it in there and looked and I think
[34:07] it's 168 times that the Bible uses my
[34:12] soul so it's a very important part is
[34:15] it's not something that's just the
[34:17] nature of
[34:18] something you know it is what causes our
[34:24] nature all right now follow me with that
[34:27] thought the soul is the you the person
[34:31] that you
[34:33] are and that's what
[34:35] causes a reaction to take place through
[34:39] your spirit out into your
[34:43] body we'll get to it in a little while
[34:45] where the Prophet keeps saying you know
[34:47] soul that
[34:48] sinth it doesn't say the spirit that
[34:51] sinth it says the soul that sinth amen
[34:55] cu the soul is the real you
[34:59] it's the part that God is working on
[35:01] because you can be anointed as we said
[35:03] this morning what you can be anointed on
[35:05] your spirit and still be
[35:09] lost but if that soul is truly born
[35:15] again see then it can never be lost am
[35:19] all right now then being as we believe
[35:23] in the one true and living
[35:26] God and not believing in a second person
[35:29] or third person or
[35:31] whatever but believing that God came
[35:35] himself to die for you and I amen then
[35:39] the spirit that he
[35:42] gave could come back and
[35:46] anoint right right your spirit amen see
[35:50] in body he was a man which made him my
[35:53] brother right in spirit is the anoint or
[35:58] anointing yes and that anointing could
[36:01] be on you and you still be lost right
[36:05] that's that was a hard one when we first
[36:07] begin to talk about those things that
[36:09] the prophet was saying wouldn't
[36:12] it but do you realize what I'm trying to
[36:14] say yes that Soul that's in you as we'll
[36:18] get to in a minute by the new
[36:21] birth that is the soul of almighty God
[36:24] Amen the person of Almighty God coming
[36:28] and living in
[36:31] you and that's your new
[36:33] birth it's a person it's not just an
[36:38] anointing see if it's just an anointing
[36:40] you just be anointed one that's right
[36:43] but it's the very person of almighty
[36:46] God to come and live inside of you and I
[36:49] all right and then that way it's more
[36:52] real than anything else about you that's
[36:55] true now I'm going to make a hard
[36:57] statement now so listen to me then the
[37:02] Soul being like it is is more real than
[37:05] anything you
[37:08] see amen right that's right CU you can
[37:11] blow all this
[37:14] away and you can't destroy the soul
[37:17] that's right that's why the Bible says
[37:19] it we get to at the end Baby Don't Fear
[37:22] him that can destroy the body that's
[37:26] right fear Him him that can destroy the
[37:28] soul
[37:30] that's see nobody can destroy the soul
[37:33] no God is the only one that can do that
[37:37] all right so then the Soul is the real
[37:40] part of you all right as we talk about
[37:42] this morning we title it the
[37:44] soul but we're going to talk about this
[37:47] afternoon and then maybe the Lord
[37:50] willing Wednesday a little
[37:51] more the real
[37:56] you I can't see you brother Gary but
[37:59] we're taught that
[38:00] right I see the body you
[38:03] inhabit you can deceive me that's right
[38:07] because you can act religious that's
[38:10] right you can act a Christian that's
[38:14] right you can do every bit of that
[38:16] that's true and it not be right that's
[38:18] right now the kind old priest is the
[38:21] prophet gave the
[38:23] definition who married you who who
[38:28] dedicated your babies who uh loaned you
[38:31] money who who done
[38:34] everything the kind of O pra now Jesus
[38:37] Just Whipped people and hollered and
[38:40] screamed at them all the
[38:42] time who would we have
[38:44] picked to being the right
[38:50] one you
[38:53] see me deceiving you is not going to
[38:56] help me
[38:58] right that's one thing I've always been
[39:00] an open
[39:01] book and I guess maybe I'm too
[39:04] open and I I I do that way but I've just
[39:08] always been an open book I don't believe
[39:11] in lying and and
[39:13] hiding you know you say well I'm not
[39:15] lying or no but maybe I'm hiding you
[39:17] know and it's kind of like brother Mo
[39:20] was telling about a guy you heard me
[39:21] tell you before little boy down here in
[39:23] town they were all cutting up doing
[39:25] things and the police came by and
[39:28] shine a light around this little boy was
[39:30] hiding behind a a little Old Post you
[39:33] know well it was more outside the post
[39:35] and there was behind it but to shine a
[39:38] light on him said what you doing boy he
[39:39] said
[39:41] hiding and we can hide all we want to
[39:44] and play all games we want
[39:47] to but the soul is the one that's going
[39:49] to answer that's right
[39:52] now you've heard the story of the lady
[39:58] that grieved the holy spirit away from
[40:00] her and wouldn't receive it we'll get to
[40:03] that in the
[40:06] message and that grieved so far away
[40:09] from her that she didn't realize what
[40:11] was going
[40:12] on she said I could see my mother Soul
[40:15] fry in hell and life offered brother
[40:19] Brown him a drink of liquor offered him
[40:21] a
[40:22] cigarette
[40:24] everything because she grieved it away
[40:28] but when she become to the place of
[40:32] dying the prophet said her soul came up
[40:35] but you remember what
[40:37] the preacher had the doctor to do shoot
[40:39] her with a hypo and knock her
[40:41] unconscious right and her screaming
[40:45] out let's don't get down to that
[40:48] part let's be straight serious am and no
[40:52] matter
[40:53] what let's just do what God says and mo
[40:56] follow it that away
[40:57] all right so we asked the Prophet this
[41:00] morning what is the
[41:01] soul he said the soul is the nature of
[41:05] the
[41:06] spirit so whatever I'm
[41:11] displaying you know real genuine now not
[41:14] being hypocritical hiding it but
[41:16] whatever I'm displaying is whatever is
[41:19] inside of me amen
[41:22] right no that ought to make you think
[41:25] about the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[41:27] whether or not the spirit and you agree
[41:29] with the
[41:31] word but you can say I agree with the
[41:33] word and live like the devil that's
[41:36] right now something went wrong didn't
[41:40] it but just think about it see the
[41:44] nature of the spirit is the soul of
[41:50] man whatever it is that's making you and
[41:53] I what we
[41:55] are is the real soul Soul amen all right
[42:00] now by that by the way that I scream and
[42:03] holler you know the way I try to preach
[42:07] I think you ought to know what's with
[42:08] inside of me okay that's right amen
[42:12] because I display it that's right and
[42:15] I'm not hypocritical to to be one thing
[42:18] with you and something else with
[42:20] somebody else or any different I try to
[42:23] be the same good or bad you know because
[42:27] that's the only way to
[42:30] be so then you look out at the world and
[42:33] you see them living and doing wrong and
[42:35] people says oh look at them oh they
[42:37] they're just they're they're going to go
[42:39] to hell they you know they're they're
[42:42] just Sinners that's
[42:44] right you know what they're doing
[42:47] they're just just displaying what's in
[42:50] their soul that's right because their
[42:53] Spirit between the soul and the body is
[42:56] making the parts working in the memories
[42:59] and the and then the body is displaying
[43:02] it openly that's right
[43:06] right see because that's what we were
[43:08] trying to get to this morning ending it
[43:09] up was
[43:11] what borned Satan's
[43:16] domain closer akin to the devil Prophet
[43:19] said born between Satan and
[43:22] Eve you know in the condition we're in
[43:28] and living the same way as the world
[43:32] lives so then that's the that's what our
[43:36] soul really is that's and the Soul lives
[43:39] on no matter what you do to the body the
[43:42] soul will live on until the time that it
[43:46] either gets eternal
[43:48] life either has eternal life will get
[43:51] eternal life or will be destroyed
[43:54] yes and that's the real you right right
[43:58] that's what you are
[44:00] right you say well that's hard brother
[44:03] de on C and A lot of times I have bad
[44:06] thoughts I ain't got nothing do you Soul
[44:08] that's right right
[44:09] amen unless it is the nature of it right
[44:15] right right right now if the Bible's
[44:19] right and we believe it in the prophet
[44:21] Jesus was tempted in all points that's
[44:23] right all right was it wrong
[44:27] you know could he stop the devil from
[44:30] talking to
[44:33] him but he couldn't get to the inward
[44:36] part of him that's right he could talk
[44:38] about the body try to make him hungry he
[44:41] could talk about the spirit try to get
[44:43] him to reason and think on things but he
[44:46] couldn't get to the inside right amen
[44:50] that Inside Man spoke back out and said
[44:53] yes sir get behind me yes
[44:57] did God really thought the devil was
[44:59] real well just remember the devil is not
[45:04] a
[45:06] soul so the soul of man is greater than
[45:10] the devil amen
[45:12] even in a lost
[45:17] condition the devil we talk about him
[45:19] having power he only has power that God
[45:21] allows him to use right remember the
[45:24] prophet preaching that there there's no
[45:26] two Powers there only power he said one
[45:28] of them is a permitted power that's
[45:32] right but that Soul inside of you is
[45:35] going to live
[45:36] on no matter what happens to the
[45:40] flesh all
[45:42] right but see then we just say it's when
[45:44] it's just the nature no it's not just
[45:46] the nature I keep saying that but when
[45:50] you say it's just a nature you're
[45:52] bringing it down into a lower category
[45:55] that's right to toally than what I'm
[45:57] talking
[46:00] about I'm not talking about just a
[46:02] nature of something right just a bird
[46:05] dog or a hound dog or a I'm talking
[46:08] about the very life that you are amen
[46:11] that's
[46:13] right and just think about a man back
[46:15] there like the psalmist David yet in a
[46:19] lost condition
[46:21] right you agree he was not a born again
[46:24] Christian
[46:27] it wasn't back there that's right but
[46:30] yet he'd say my soul thirsted after
[46:36] thee my
[46:40] soul it's the soul of
[46:43] man now watch no matter whether it's
[46:46] Christian or
[46:50] Saint was created of God cuz that's why
[46:53] it says Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls are mind
[46:56] the soul of the father soul of the son
[46:57] All Souls are mine right amen all right
[47:01] then there's no way the devil could give
[47:03] you a soul cuz it'd be a Creator that's
[47:05] right and he can't do it that's
[47:09] right now that soul is
[47:12] so um
[47:16] marvelous until you've heard the prophet
[47:18] tell the story of or tell about that a
[47:22] woman is fixing to have a
[47:24] baby he said just a little prior before
[47:26] she had has the child he says there just
[47:29] a sweet
[47:31] presence comes around that person you
[47:34] know he said it's that little
[47:38] life waiting to come into that body
[47:42] that's going to be
[47:44] produced all
[47:45] right is it just a spirit floating
[47:50] around is it the
[47:53] soul one brother there then how could
[47:55] the soul just into you don't know well
[47:58] you tell me how it can out because it
[48:01] can if you
[48:02] die that's you worried about how it gets
[48:05] in there then right but think with
[48:11] me that soul is the real you that's
[48:14] right
[48:15] amen that's why in the in Genesis it
[48:18] said let us make man
[48:21] yes but what did he
[48:25] make what did he make back
[48:29] there the
[48:32] soul all
[48:34] right but see then it's not just the
[48:36] nature of
[48:38] something it is the nature of the spirit
[48:42] because the spirit then
[48:45] displays what is the inward
[48:48] part right of the being all right then
[48:53] we got over that far this morning so
[48:54] let's pick up we'll try to
[48:57] pick up some of this we got some extra
[48:59] notes I had another part we move it over
[49:02] so okay we try to do the best we can go
[49:05] ahead and look at number seven because
[49:07] that's kind of where we were ending up
[49:08] this
[49:10] morning in the the
[49:13] message and uh we'll just try to start
[49:17] it from here and we'll go as far as we
[49:18] can and it don't bother me to have to
[49:22] preach on it again Wednesday
[49:25] night but look now this is
[49:28] 1963 Souls that are in prison now
[49:31] paragraph
[49:32] 36 now the soul of man is not the body
[49:35] of man it's the
[49:38] soul and the soul is something that's
[49:41] the the nature of the
[49:44] spirit right and see you could take that
[49:47] and you just well it's just the nature
[49:49] of a spirit see
[49:52] it's read on when he said we are dead
[49:55] the scripture PL it tells us that we are
[49:57] dead and our lives are HID in God
[50:00] through Christ sealed there by the Holy
[50:04] Spirit it wasn't your body died it
[50:08] wasn't your spirit
[50:12] died we get time we get to the new
[50:16] birth and you'll see then from the
[50:20] scriptures I give you new heart I give
[50:23] you new spirit
[50:25] amen but then it doesn't say it and I'll
[50:27] give you another Spirit what' it
[50:30] say remember the new heart is
[50:33] justification the new spirit is because
[50:37] that you couldn't even live with your
[50:38] own self all right we said I put my
[50:42] spirit in you
[50:45] right there's your new birth right all
[50:49] right see when he said we're dead the
[50:50] scripture plainly tell us we are dead
[50:52] and our lives are hidden God through
[50:53] Christ sealed our by the Holy Spirit now
[50:56] it wasn't that your body died it wasn't
[50:58] your spirit died it was the nature of
[51:01] your spirit died see the nature which is
[51:04] the
[51:05] soul now listen to
[51:08] him the nature of your soul is is
[51:13] God if you're born again that's right
[51:17] right now you're saying well that's a
[51:19] nature of a
[51:21] nature
[51:24] no it's a display outwardly of what's
[51:27] inwardly that's right right that's right
[51:31] see the nature of your
[51:36] soul
[51:39] what is God if you're born again that's
[51:44] right if it's not it's of the world
[51:47] that's true all right now the nature of
[51:51] your
[51:53] soul is the world if you're lost
[51:57] if you're born again it's of God is that
[52:01] simple so when somebody comes along and
[52:03] talks to you about well it's just the
[52:05] nature and what brother R said the
[52:07] nature of your
[52:09] soul is God if you're born again that's
[52:12] right if not it's of the world that's
[52:15] right that should be a answer that you
[52:18] should remember right that's right all
[52:23] right anything to begin has an end so
[52:26] therefore the only way that you can have
[52:28] eternal life is to have a life that
[52:30] never did begin
[52:32] yes and then your life did begin when
[52:36] you were born when God breathed the
[52:38] breath of life into your nostrils and
[52:40] you became a living soul and You Begin
[52:43] then but when you
[52:47] watch that nature that was in you
[52:49] paragraph
[52:51] 37 by Nature you was of the world
[52:55] alienated from God that's right you were
[52:58] actually an
[53:01] animal that's exactly right anyone knows
[53:03] that a that we are mammal and many knows
[53:06] that we are a mammal we are a
[53:08] warm-blooded animal that's that's what
[53:10] we are by our Earthly creation but you
[53:13] see what made us different from other
[53:16] animals that God put a soul upon us now
[53:20] there looks like something just put up
[53:22] on but we'll read on down here see
[53:27] it's not something just put up that's
[53:29] right amen all right see the other
[53:33] mammals don't have to wear clothes no
[53:36] other animal has to wear clothes to hide
[53:38] his shame but us we're the only one that
[53:41] does it because we have a soul that's
[53:46] just not something put on you
[53:50] right that's anointings and
[53:54] things it's the real you
[53:57] amen it's what you are that's right all
[54:01] right the nature of the world was in us
[54:05] that's right amen all
[54:08] right now look what he says on the next
[54:10] we go to number eight the uncertain
[54:11] sound
[54:13] 1955 7:31 what I'm doing if you'll
[54:18] notice I'm going backwards and
[54:21] force the older tapes to the newer tapes
[54:25] where people says well he changed these
[54:30] things you'll find him all the way
[54:32] through the message from 47 to 65
[54:37] saying that the soul is the nature of
[54:39] the
[54:42] spirit he doesn't say the spirit is the
[54:45] nature of the soul in those
[54:48] words but that's what it
[54:51] is but it's not in that
[54:53] term okay but that's what we are
[54:58] we're supposed to be whatever is within
[55:00] us the inner part is supposed to be
[55:02] displayed in the second realm okay right
[55:06] and then that's supposed to be displayed
[55:08] through the body right if not we're
[55:11] hypocrite that's right you know
[55:13] something's wrong the outside can be
[55:16] religious and even get an anointing upon
[55:19] that Spirit to be so great that's
[55:24] right brother R said about the lady
[55:26] we're talking one of them he said that's
[55:28] the reason you can't tell her it's wrong
[55:29] to wear pants now said cuz she's
[55:37] anointed and see if you're
[55:40] anointed I mean I'm I'm honest come on
[55:43] now just I like to talk honest but hate
[55:45] to be but it's good point you know find
[55:49] you a preacher that's going to get up
[55:50] and say well I don't know whether I'm
[55:52] preaching the truth or
[55:54] not you ever heard one say that that yes
[55:58] see no everybody swies by what they're
[56:01] preaching the Lord told me this
[56:05] yes
[56:08] right all
[56:09] right well
[56:11] look let's just read some
[56:15] things as I was saying a few days ago
[56:18] either here or somewhere speaking on the
[56:20] lie detector talking about the lie
[56:23] detector and how it works now notice
[56:25] close now I I want you pay close
[56:28] attention put a lie detector on you and
[56:31] you try to impersonate the the truth and
[56:34] try to say that it's the
[56:36] truth but down on the inside of
[56:41] you what sub the
[56:46] subconscious lays a place called a
[56:51] soul and this intellectual mind does not
[56:55] govern the
[56:57] vibration of the system the mind is only
[57:01] a director it will direct
[57:04] you now
[57:09] subconscious well that's just some kind
[57:11] of a sub you know you got your brain you
[57:14] go through it you got your conscious
[57:16] your subconscious your
[57:18] unconscious
[57:20] right but he's bringing out
[57:23] that the subconscious part of you
[57:28] is your
[57:30] soul now in
[57:34] body are you listening to his definition
[57:37] yes you can
[57:38] lie that's right you've seen people that
[57:41] D straight face tell you a ball face lie
[57:44] that's right I told you about it old boy
[57:47] used to tell so many lies we wrod to
[57:49] work together and then when he get at
[57:51] work he tell that thing again two or
[57:53] three times and he said Sam ain't that
[57:54] right I said by Highway
[58:00] cuz he'd even change it after he told it
[58:02] to
[58:02] me and expect me to agree with him
[58:07] yeah but
[58:09] listen you put a lie detector on you
[58:12] does that Li detector is it governed by
[58:15] your
[58:17] body is it governed by your
[58:21] spirit or is it governed by your
[58:23] unconscious
[58:27] you can train that Spirit that's
[58:31] right right that's right you can trick
[58:34] in every way but
[58:36] that subconscious part of you that real
[58:39] you is not going to lie why because
[58:42] you're made in the image of
[58:45] God no matter what you think about a
[58:47] soul the soul of man will get to it in a
[58:50] minute is in the image of
[58:54] God and it can't lie
[58:57] the real you can't lie the lie detector
[59:00] will show up that's right all right so
[59:05] listen your intellectual mind does not
[59:07] govern that vibration of the system the
[59:10] mind is only director it will direct you
[59:12] and it's it it is very incapable of
[59:15] bringing you to
[59:16] God see all of that your mind you cannot
[59:20] know God by your mind intellectual it's
[59:22] one of the resources or the channels
[59:25] that would lead you to it but your soul
[59:28] is what governs you you are what you are
[59:32] by your
[59:36] soul your soul is what governs you you
[59:40] are what you are by your
[59:42] soul now look at this
[59:44] definition Jesus said to the Pharisees
[59:47] says why you Hypocrites how can you
[59:49] speak good things when they was calling
[59:52] him good master and so forth
[59:58] right didn't want to kill him that's
[59:59] right sit out of the abundance of the
[1:00:01] heart speak of the
[1:00:04] lips and in your heart you hate
[1:00:07] me and in your lips you call me good
[1:00:13] Master he's describing a die detector
[1:00:15] wouldn't show up like
[1:00:17] that he said you
[1:00:20] Hypocrites see your soul is thinking one
[1:00:23] thing
[1:00:26] and you're speaking with your lips
[1:00:28] another thing what a
[1:00:30] case good definition of a hypocrite a
[1:00:33] that's right
[1:00:35] amen what a horrible thing what a
[1:00:38] deceitful thing is a hypocrite for out
[1:00:40] of their mind they say one thing when
[1:00:43] their soul says another
[1:00:46] thing I think that's a good definition
[1:00:48] don't you
[1:00:50] yes of what it is all
[1:00:53] right so your soul is what governs you
[1:00:58] look at the next one thirsting for Life
[1:01:03] 1958 611 par or 15 did you ever read
[1:01:08] such
[1:01:09] words how my soul longer for thee in a
[1:01:12] thirsty land where no water is that's
[1:01:15] David
[1:01:16] right this is rather an unusual text but
[1:01:20] God is unusual remember he's thirsting
[1:01:22] for life God does unusual things he
[1:01:25] works mysterious way way is wonders to
[1:01:26] perform and we're living in an unusual
[1:01:29] day in an unusual time but we're serving
[1:01:31] the god that's seen all times God that's
[1:01:34] been excuse me in all time and when I
[1:01:36] thought of this you know my soul thirst
[1:01:39] is for
[1:01:40] day if your soul is what directs you is
[1:01:44] what makes you what you
[1:01:47] are come on a conversion
[1:01:51] is now watch him he's going to explain a
[1:01:54] conversion
[1:01:57] a soul is the nature of the spirit and
[1:02:00] when a man is
[1:02:02] converted he doesn't get another
[1:02:09] Spirit he gets a spirit
[1:02:13] change now he's in it
[1:02:15] real a conversion means to change his
[1:02:19] thinking change his way of living and so
[1:02:22] forth so my soul thirsteth for thee
[1:02:28] can't you just see David out
[1:02:31] there and all of those things that's
[1:02:37] happening but yet in all of the bad that
[1:02:40] he could
[1:02:41] do but on the home way from the bed the
[1:02:44] prophet
[1:02:46] said from the bed with
[1:02:49] basba he cries
[1:02:51] out return unto me the joy of thy
[1:02:55] salvation
[1:02:57] am he
[1:02:59] knew there was something
[1:03:01] wrong he knew he wasn't supposed to be
[1:03:04] doing that he just took his best friend
[1:03:06] which was one of his mighty men and took
[1:03:09] his
[1:03:11] wife he knew that as a
[1:03:17] sinner get that Soul within
[1:03:22] him may I get just a little deeper in
[1:03:24] the thought
[1:03:27] was it just some anointing that came on
[1:03:29] him that he could kill a bar a
[1:03:33] Lon or a
[1:03:38] giant was it just some anointing that
[1:03:41] would raise
[1:03:45] up or was it the real
[1:03:48] part of David on the
[1:03:52] inside that he said was thirsting after
[1:03:55] God
[1:03:57] sure it was the anointing right we know
[1:04:03] that but that anointing was connected
[1:04:06] with
[1:04:08] David right
[1:04:11] right think on these
[1:04:13] things all
[1:04:23] right look at the next one you must be
[1:04:25] born
[1:04:27] again 61
[1:04:30] 12:31 paragraph 1
[1:04:33] 11 a soul good or
[1:04:36] bad death doesn't change
[1:04:39] it I've had a lot of scripture wrote
[1:04:41] down I had a lot of scripture wrote down
[1:04:43] on here on this one that I wanted to
[1:04:46] comment on what is a
[1:04:48] soul what is a
[1:04:51] soul it's
[1:04:54] you you you are soul the part inside of
[1:05:00] you and when you die ever watch shap
[1:05:03] that Soul's in that's the way it goes It
[1:05:08] goes to its
[1:05:10] destination you couldn't pull it up no
[1:05:12] matter how much you do what you do for
[1:05:15] it that Soul's got to be changed here
[1:05:18] and born again that's right simple
[1:05:21] thought isn't it
[1:05:23] yes look at the next one
[1:05:29] souls in
[1:05:31] prison paragraph 44 63
[1:05:35] 1110 but that Soul that's in there see
[1:05:39] that soul is what God is working on see
[1:05:43] that's right he's not working on your
[1:05:49] body and we are
[1:05:54] taught now let's see if you agree with
[1:05:57] me we are taught by the prophet not to
[1:06:02] uh try to pull people to the
[1:06:05] altar
[1:06:08] right you know not to go down the aisles
[1:06:11] and and you need to come to the Lord you
[1:06:13] know your mama was a good Mama and she's
[1:06:16] in glory you want to be in glory with
[1:06:18] Mama don't
[1:06:21] you we're taught not to do that is that
[1:06:25] right right that's right everybody agree
[1:06:29] amen you said but I'm L of the
[1:06:36] Lord now if you're letter of the Lord
[1:06:38] you go ahead and do
[1:06:42] it
[1:06:44] okay but there's one thing about it he's
[1:06:47] going to speak aely to me to get me to
[1:06:49] walk that aisle and put my hand on you
[1:06:51] and try to convince you to come to the
[1:06:53] altar because the prophet said
[1:06:56] that wasn't right he said this way he
[1:06:59] said you make them a twofold child of
[1:07:03] hell he said it'll be double harder the
[1:07:06] next time to get them to come to the
[1:07:11] altar right do what you want
[1:07:13] to I love to stud what he says cuz I can
[1:07:16] be in the scripture with all right so
[1:07:19] now
[1:07:21] watch it's not to try to scare this body
[1:07:26] you're going to burn in hell if you
[1:07:27] don't come to the Altar and get
[1:07:35] saved it's not to dealing with your
[1:07:38] memory your conscience your
[1:07:41] affections you want to be in heaven with
[1:07:43] Mama Don't You Mama's in glory and you
[1:07:47] want to be
[1:07:52] there I know you don't like it I know a
[1:07:54] lot of people don't like it
[1:07:56] but I remember where I came
[1:08:00] from and I remember the days when people
[1:08:04] tried to talk me into going to the
[1:08:08] altar I've told you about it that I told
[1:08:11] the Deacon board or some of them when
[1:08:13] they come to try to talk to me about the
[1:08:15] Lord I said I live a better life than
[1:08:18] your Deacon board lives and I'm
[1:08:22] lost and they didn't want me to explain
[1:08:25] what I
[1:08:26] cuz I was capable of it name calling you
[1:08:32] know but see I've just always been
[1:08:35] honest I like the little story you know
[1:08:37] they bring all the kids up to the Altar
[1:08:39] and they pray and everything they get
[1:08:40] through and and they asked each one of
[1:08:43] them said the Lord done anything yes yes
[1:08:44] yes they asked this one said the Lord
[1:08:46] done he said no well see he was probably
[1:08:49] the one that answered
[1:08:51] correctly all
[1:08:53] right so Christianity is not dealing
[1:08:56] with bodies that's
[1:08:59] right it's not dealing with
[1:09:03] Spirits he dealing with the inside of
[1:09:06] you how many times you ever heard me say
[1:09:09] I don't talk to bodies I don't talk to
[1:09:13] spirits I'm preaching to the inside of
[1:09:15] you amen
[1:09:19] amen now forgive me but to say it
[1:09:26] what about in this message that all you
[1:09:28] hear is women's dress and hiring
[1:09:33] clothes and is your wife worthy of the
[1:09:37] Gospel you notice why I said that is
[1:09:40] your wife worthy of the Gospel we get
[1:09:42] our wives straight up we ready to
[1:09:46] go is it the emotional side of
[1:09:52] it you know telling the wonderful story

[1:10:29] cry about Jesus and what he done then I
[1:10:32] don't have to worry about crying about
[1:10:33] brother randam and his
[1:10:35] wife
[1:10:38] right I hope something's doning on
[1:10:44] you it's not to get our bodies lined up
[1:10:48] it's not to get our spirit because
[1:10:49] neither one are the born again

[1:11:29] who he
[1:11:31] is and what he done for me and like I
[1:11:34] said Wednesday night I don't understand
[1:11:37] I don't understand this one how that the
[1:11:39] people of this message can sit and
[1:11:41] sympathize with the preachers when are
[1:11:44] they going to say you're not saying what
[1:11:46] Paul said you're not saying what brother
[1:11:48] Ram said
[1:11:50] amen but brother you don't understand
[1:11:52] that brother he don't know what you no
[1:11:56] how old is
[1:12:01] he if he stay out of Walmart read he
[1:12:04] might know something
[1:12:08] right
[1:12:11] right
[1:12:14] look that soul is what God is working
[1:12:19] on there's no parts of your salvation
[1:12:22] working through your body that's right
[1:12:25] you said Y no
[1:12:27] no something on the inside is what makes
[1:12:29] your body stop doing things that's right
[1:12:32] amen right right the new birth is in the
[1:12:36] soul of
[1:12:39] man okay yes it's in the real you yes
[1:12:44] see that is that soul is what God is
[1:12:46] working on Amen see all right then if I
[1:12:51] can preach to you now here here's one
[1:12:54] thing gets me I'm
[1:12:57] sorry people say brother Dale You're
[1:12:59] Just Too Deep you too you preach on
[1:13:01] these deep
[1:13:04] things and brother brandham preaching as
[1:13:07] he did I believe was the deepest teacher
[1:13:09] that's ever been outside the Lord Jesus
[1:13:11] Christ don't you right when you agree
[1:13:14] with that now I'm just
[1:13:19] honest but
[1:13:21] yet he was the one that taught us these
[1:13:24] things
[1:13:28] and he could
[1:13:30] preach Souls that are in prison
[1:13:34] now and the altar fill
[1:13:39] up some of you were sitting there and
[1:13:44] seen him preach some of the deepest
[1:13:45] messages you've ever seen and people
[1:13:48] weep their way to the
[1:13:53] altar right
[1:13:56] was he preaching little sugar tips
[1:13:58] little baby
[1:14:00] thing and the people come to the altar
[1:14:02] was you preaching clothes and hiring
[1:14:04] dress the people come to the altar or
[1:14:06] was he preaching to the soul of the
[1:14:08] individual that's
[1:14:12] right it's in here or we just read it
[1:14:14] one he said if he can get to nature of
[1:14:16] that soul to agree with him it's in
[1:14:17] souls and prison did that nature or
[1:14:21] die come
[1:14:23] on that soul is what God is working on
[1:14:26] if it here it is if it can only get that
[1:14:28] nature that Spirit to agree with him
[1:14:31] then that nature
[1:14:33] dies the nature and the love of the
[1:14:36] world
[1:14:39] dies and the things of the world is dead
[1:14:42] see because if you love the world and
[1:14:43] the things of the world the love of God
[1:14:45] is not in you see a man must be born
[1:14:48] again so this Nature has to die and the
[1:14:52] nature of God comes and lives in you and
[1:14:55] God is the only thing that there is that
[1:14:57] never did begin or never did end so
[1:15:00] therefore he has
[1:15:03] partnership you that's see right and
[1:15:07] taken this man
[1:15:10] Earthly and this eternal spirit and put
[1:15:13] it together
[1:15:16] amen not anointing right
[1:15:21] right because God reflects himself back
[1:15:24] in there
[1:15:25] that he become a man when he become
[1:15:27] Christ Jesus and he was God see God was
[1:15:30] in Christ that see lived in him
[1:15:32] reconcile in the world himself and
[1:15:34] through that perfect man each one of us
[1:15:37] imperfect that believe in God and has
[1:15:40] accepted that becomes the
[1:15:43] Perfection of him
[1:15:46] amen and he never left his body see
[1:15:49] corruption neither did he leave his soul
[1:15:52] in hell but raised him up on the third
[1:15:55] day and he's alive forever more and
[1:15:57] we'll have a body like a his glorious
[1:15:59] body that's why we're baptized into his
[1:16:01] name that's that we might come forth in
[1:16:04] his name in his death in his
[1:16:06] resurrection that we Rise Again
[1:16:08] testifying to the world that we have new
[1:16:11] life that the old man is Dead We buried
[1:16:14] that first
[1:16:15] nature see the first nature is
[1:16:18] gone and now we are the nature of
[1:16:22] him he lives in US amen and we don't do
[1:16:26] our own will we don't we do his will we
[1:16:29] don't think our own thoughts now listen
[1:16:30] to this
[1:16:32] one the mind the mind is what
[1:16:36] thinks get spiritual for a second on
[1:16:39] what he's
[1:16:40] saying the mind that was in
[1:16:44] Christ is in every
[1:16:49] believer right the mind that was in
[1:16:51] Christ in an never believer did you get
[1:16:53] a brain transplant when you born
[1:16:56] again did your spirit annihilate and you
[1:16:59] got another
[1:17:06] spirit the mind that was in Christ Jesus
[1:17:08] is an every believer see there there is
[1:17:12] the
[1:17:15] soul and that's what we're speaking of
[1:17:19] now that's the part I'm thinking of now
[1:17:23] that that's within us
[1:17:25] the
[1:17:27] soul so when Paul was saying the mind of
[1:17:31] Christ he said I have the mind of
[1:17:35] Christ you wasn't talking about his head
[1:17:38] right you talking about a born again
[1:17:40] experience in his
[1:17:42] soul that the mind of Christ could dwell
[1:17:45] in his soul because the mind of Christ
[1:17:47] is the soul of almighty God
[1:17:52] Amen come on
[1:17:57] amen what do we think about
[1:18:03] it that's the part that I'm thinking of
[1:18:07] that's within us that's soul in prison
[1:18:09] 1963
[1:18:17] 1110 look at Ezekiel 18:4 we just
[1:18:23] read behold All Souls are
[1:18:28] mine as the soul of the father so also
[1:18:32] the soul of the son is mine God's the
[1:18:36] only Creator the only way you can get a
[1:18:38] soul it's there not a nature that's
[1:18:40] indwelled in you I've made myself
[1:18:44] clear we are born in Satan's domain
[1:18:48] Satan can't give us a soul so he
[1:18:50] perverts the nature of that soul to him
[1:18:55] right right
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:58] okay but look what he sums up this is
[1:19:02] only two times in the
[1:19:05] Bible said the
[1:19:07] soul that
[1:19:09] sinth it shall
[1:19:12] die is that is that who's the English
[1:19:14] major in here behold comma all things
[1:19:17] are M you know the two little doing when
[1:19:20] you got down to the two dots so also so
[1:19:22] the soul of the son is mind stop and
[1:19:26] think don't stop start another sentence
[1:19:29] don't start another thought stop and
[1:19:31] think about what's being
[1:19:37] said right slow down pause just a
[1:19:42] little that two dots and that other dot
[1:19:46] with a long line both of them are
[1:19:48] basically not means it's just to slow
[1:19:49] down and think a period means stop a
[1:19:52] comma means slow down and just continue
[1:19:56] going I ain't no endless
[1:20:00] major I'm reading by Revelation not
[1:20:02] what's
[1:20:03] in English language because he says
[1:20:07] behold All Souls are mine the soul of
[1:20:09] the father Soul it's mine so now let me
[1:20:12] sum it up the soul that sin us shall
[1:20:16] die I said there's only two places
[1:20:18] Ezekiel 1820 is the other one go ahead
[1:20:22] with that
[1:20:25] the soul that sinth it shall
[1:20:31] die if you'll notice on
[1:20:34] 184 back prior to 184 it says this
[1:20:37] Parable shall not be spoken anymore you
[1:20:39] know about you you eating grapes and
[1:20:41] your children get
[1:20:43] to you
[1:20:45] know teast problems you eating graes
[1:20:49] makes a bitter than the baby no no not
[1:20:51] for the daddy especially the soul that
[1:20:53] sinth it shall die
[1:20:55] the soul shall not bear the iniquity of
[1:20:57] the father so the excuse me the son
[1:20:59] shall not bear the iniquity of the
[1:21:01] father right he's going to go on his own
[1:21:04] right because he's a soul Le shall the
[1:21:08] father by the iniquity of the
[1:21:10] son the righteousness of the righteous
[1:21:13] shall be upon him and the wickedness of
[1:21:15] the wicked shall be upon
[1:21:17] Him son don't answer for the father
[1:21:20] father don't answer for the son in the
[1:21:23] New Testament amen that's
[1:21:25] right right right the soul that sinth it
[1:21:29] shall die
[1:21:31] amen it'll die
[1:21:33] why because of what it is right look at
[1:21:37] the next
[1:21:40] one this is take them to that day on
[1:21:42] Calvary 60 1969 25 paragraph
[1:21:46] 46 there was a requirement for sin
[1:21:49] requirement was death death was the
[1:21:51] penalty and that we go into great
[1:21:53] details of this but because I do not
[1:21:55] believe that there is but one death and
[1:21:57] he's not talking about the second death
[1:21:59] there is just one death cuz it's when
[1:22:01] you die there is one life and I believe
[1:22:05] a man that has eternal life can never
[1:22:08] die I believe there is a complete
[1:22:12] annihilation of that soul that
[1:22:19] sins there is a complete annihilation of
[1:22:23] the soul that sin
[1:22:26] so we either going to get
[1:22:29] annihilated and get the new birth and
[1:22:32] die to
[1:22:34] ourselves and let him cleanse that out
[1:22:38] or we're going to
[1:22:41] die at the second Resurrection have to
[1:22:44] go to the Judgment right right I believe
[1:22:47] there is a complete annihilation of that
[1:22:49] soul that sins for the Bible said the
[1:22:51] soul that sinth it say surely die not
[1:22:54] the man now what is he saying that it
[1:22:57] doesn't say the man it doesn't say your
[1:22:59] spirit it doesn't say the spirit that
[1:23:01] sth it shall die it doesn't say the man
[1:23:03] that sent it it says the soul y right
[1:23:07] the real
[1:23:08] you all right the soul that sin us so
[1:23:11] Satan must surely
[1:23:13] die to be completely
[1:23:16] destroyed he different with the
[1:23:18] Universalist that says Satan will be
[1:23:20] saved he said and he's the originator of
[1:23:22] sin now get all mixed up here and his
[1:23:26] soul
[1:23:30] sinned you talking much Satan well you
[1:23:33] just said want to go Satan didn't have
[1:23:36] soul and he was a spirit that sure
[1:23:40] Spirit shall totally be totally
[1:23:42] annihilated but need nothing left of
[1:23:45] it it's not saying Satan's got a
[1:23:49] soul and make him a
[1:23:52] person okay
[1:23:55] totally
[1:24:01] annihilated let's just read this next
[1:24:06] one 1956
[1:24:09] 422 e 73 on the choice of father and a
[1:24:13] soul that sinth it shall die is that
[1:24:15] right that means to separate death means
[1:24:20] separation he that heareth my word
[1:24:23] believeth on him who sent
[1:24:25] me has everlasting life cannot die but
[1:24:29] when you grieve that
[1:24:31] Soul it goes away from
[1:24:35] you it was done far from her now that's
[1:24:38] the lady he's talking
[1:24:42] about didn't talk to her no
[1:24:47] more but when her intellects begin to
[1:24:49] wreck up she
[1:24:53] said there there's nothing left here but
[1:24:56] the soul had to come
[1:24:59] back well what was what condition was it
[1:25:03] in see when it walked up began to rebuke
[1:25:06] her for the life she'd live she said oh
[1:25:10] my God I'm
[1:25:11] lost sound like he's talking about even
[1:25:14] just her Natural
[1:25:18] Soul comes
[1:25:20] back you've heard the story of her she's

[1:25:42] Soul until that Soul won't be able to
[1:25:44] correct

[1:26:29] sin it's the real
[1:26:32] you it wasn't made to do wrong and it'll
[1:26:35] correct you if you listen yes amen but

[1:26:41] go totally away from you even your own
[1:26:43] soul part there won't be no contact you
[1:26:46] just be
[1:26:47] living that's what he's explaining about
[1:26:49] her
[1:26:55] so what is
[1:27:00] it let's see if I can find one I got it
[1:27:02] somewhere
[1:27:07] here may have it done read it and missed
[1:27:09] over the point I wanted to
[1:27:21] make we've evidentally done Reddit
[1:27:23] because he said is the real
[1:27:28] you the real
[1:27:31] you is the
[1:27:34] soul whether you're a sinner or a
[1:27:37] saint the real you is the soul there's
[1:27:42] nothing more
[1:27:45] real in life than the soul of man
[1:27:50] amen that's a real you amen now when
[1:27:54] these days when we get through with
[1:27:55] predestination I'll preach on the real
[1:27:59] you the real
[1:28:03] you see the real you is that Soul down
[1:28:06] in there
[1:28:08] right it's greater than your body it's
[1:28:10] greater than your spirit it's the real
[1:28:15] you is what you
[1:28:19] are but the soul that sinth it shall die
[1:28:25] see there is no such thing as the spirit
[1:28:28] that sinth the soul that
[1:28:31] sinth you shall
[1:28:35] die what is the second death got it in
[1:28:38] here if you need it the second death is
[1:28:41] the death of the
[1:28:43] Soul over which have no part no second
[1:28:45] death have no part the second death the
[1:28:48] death of the
[1:28:49] Soul first death is your natural life
[1:28:52] dying
[1:28:54] second death is the death of the
[1:28:56] Soul all right so we either going to die
[1:29:00] here and get born
[1:29:06] again are we going to die
[1:29:10] there that's our choice you say
[1:29:15] die Brother D I don't want to
[1:29:21] die that's where the trouble's at
[1:29:26] quitting this quitting that don't do
[1:29:28] this don't do that what did I say the
[1:29:30] other day the prophet
[1:29:32] said he asked him there what must we do
[1:29:34] to be saved he said we tell them what
[1:29:37] not to do don't drink don't smoke quit
[1:29:40] all these things he said that was not
[1:29:44] the question they asked what must we do
[1:29:47] to be born
[1:29:49] again what was their answer repent every
[1:29:52] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:29:53] of of what Jesus
[1:29:56] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:29:58] the Holy
[1:30:00] Ghost D to
[1:30:04] ourselves all right now let me spend a
[1:30:07] minute read I'm going to let the rest of
[1:30:08] the notes go I'll pick up the other part
[1:30:12] Wednesday let's just talk a little
[1:30:17] bit now if I'm a triun
[1:30:20] being Body Spirit and soul
[1:30:24] all
[1:30:26] right and that triun being that I
[1:30:32] am that means my soul is what's
[1:30:35] Eternal by the new
[1:30:38] birth but my spirit and my body is not
[1:30:43] Eternal now if the lady that we just
[1:30:46] read about the
[1:30:49] girl that she could
[1:30:51] grieve her own soul cuz he wasn't
[1:30:54] talking about the new birth for
[1:30:56] her she grieved her own soul so much in
[1:31:00] other words she kept putting it back you
[1:31:02] know drinking and doing all things
[1:31:04] numbing it with all kind of
[1:31:07] things but one day it came back up when
[1:31:10] she started to
[1:31:11] die in one quote he says when the the
[1:31:17] elements of the body body breaking down
[1:31:19] said her soul came
[1:31:22] up and she said I'm
[1:31:27] lost what about all those years she
[1:31:29] grieved it
[1:31:33] away then would it be easy for you to
[1:31:37] understand
[1:31:38] that how anointed
[1:31:43] ones can be
[1:31:45] anointed and that's where you can't tell
[1:31:47] them
[1:31:50] anything I'm as honest as I can be I
[1:31:54] don't want to go out and preach to the
[1:31:55] people of this
[1:31:56] message I lost that desire a long time
[1:31:59] ago you know what I'd rather go down
[1:32:03] here in town of Lula on the street
[1:32:08] corner that's bad I know
[1:32:13] it but I figure I'd get more results
[1:32:15] talking to
[1:32:17] Sinners lost
[1:32:19] people then I would the people of this
[1:32:21] message
[1:32:23] has got it all figured out I see
[1:32:28] it I say without backing up the biggest
[1:32:32] portion of the anointed ones in the end
[1:32:34] time are people who claim to be
[1:32:36] following this
[1:32:43] message oh you can't tell them the
[1:32:47] truth you can give them a thus sayth the
[1:32:49] Lord where the Prophet said it and they
[1:32:51] won't believe it I mean what he he
[1:32:53] literally would would say this is this
[1:32:55] this is thus sayith the
[1:32:57] Lord you know what I mean even his own
[1:33:00] words they're not going to believe
[1:33:02] it
[1:33:06] why because you see when you come into
[1:33:09] this
[1:33:10] message and you start studying this
[1:33:13] message it's very
[1:33:17] easy for that Spirit to come and anoint
[1:33:21] you because you are trying to study the
[1:33:24] message that's
[1:33:26] right follow with me a
[1:33:30] little you want to go to church you want
[1:33:33] to do right you
[1:33:35] remember you remember when you heard of
[1:33:37] the message and you really wanted to
[1:33:38] hear yes and you'd do anything to get a
[1:33:41] book or a
[1:33:43] tape right but now they're laying on
[1:33:46] your shelf at
[1:33:48] home we don't listen to tapes all the
[1:33:50] time the last night alone we listen to
[1:33:53] three men mes I was sitting there
[1:33:55] thinking I Lord I've been to church
[1:33:58] three times
[1:34:05] tonight but yet what did everybody else
[1:34:08] doing and I said I don't we don't listen
[1:34:11] tapes all the
[1:34:14] time but what is our desire what's our
[1:34:18] are doing why is it among the people of
[1:34:21] the message now and I'm watching it very
[1:34:23] close closely here in luland I see it
[1:34:25] that people are just
[1:34:31] dying the up
[1:34:34] Zeal is not here that it
[1:34:37] was when you first heard the
[1:34:48] word I don't mind saying within my own
[1:34:51] self
[1:34:54] sometimes I get to a down
[1:34:59] spot I'm
[1:35:02] human I get to a down
[1:35:06] spot and I need a little
[1:35:10] boost but I've told you also when that
[1:35:12] starts happening I know what to
[1:35:15] do I get in the message and I start
[1:35:20] searching cuz I know Satan is going to
[1:35:23] try to stop me from getting something
[1:35:25] that's right right that's right see when
[1:35:28] he can make me give up and not
[1:35:32] search he's got me
[1:35:37] conquered may I quote brother
[1:35:41] Brandon brother brandom said I've got to
[1:35:44] do
[1:35:46] something I've lost the love for the
[1:35:50] people do you need that quote or do you
[1:35:53] really remember him saying
[1:35:55] it he said I've lost the love for the
[1:35:58] people he said I got to do
[1:36:07] something even a born again
[1:36:11] Soul they still got a body and a spirit
[1:36:13] to deal with
[1:36:18] right but brother Dale isin't it
[1:36:21] reasonable
[1:36:25] that that brother's trying to say
[1:36:26] something I defend people and I have
[1:36:30] I've defended ministers who started off
[1:36:32] into
[1:36:33] doctrines and publicly told people and
[1:36:36] said don't fool with them because
[1:36:38] they're trying to say something but then
[1:36:40] when they come on out and say what they
[1:36:41] believe then I just back away and say
[1:36:44] okay let it
[1:36:47] go but you see the soul of man is a
[1:36:51] wonderful thing
[1:36:57] what we need to do is find out if that
[1:36:59] thing inside of us is the holy spirit
[1:37:01] right right now brother brandom said he
[1:37:04] sent back his soul and I've got these we
[1:37:07] I use a few of them
[1:37:09] Wednesday we know that it was his soul
[1:37:11] his Spirit his theophany of his being
[1:37:14] that went to
[1:37:15] hell now that's pretty good statement a
[1:37:18] soul Spirit the off of his
[1:37:20] being that pretty well sums up one God
[1:37:22] doesn't it right so who went to hell
[1:37:25] well Jesus the second person he went
[1:37:29] down that was the soul of
[1:37:32] God that went to
[1:37:35] hell it was not the soul of Jesus that
[1:37:38] was the second
[1:37:40] person or a human
[1:37:45] being and went to hell for you and
[1:37:47] I I don't have to go then he doesn't pay
[1:37:50] my price amen
[1:37:55] but what about that Soul inside of you
[1:37:58] does it thirst after
[1:38:02] God like I heard somebody say one time
[1:38:05] it pretty good point said reason
[1:38:07] sometimes God wakes you up in the middle
[1:38:08] of the night you ain't got nobody to
[1:38:10] talk to PR good
[1:38:13] point I never grip when I wake up 5:00
[1:38:17] this
[1:38:19] morning we getting up till 600 I get up
[1:38:22] 6:00 anyway on Sunday
[1:38:25] morning 5:00 and wide
[1:38:30] awake well Lord I don't understand I I
[1:38:34] don't sometimes maybe we blame him for
[1:38:38] so why don't you talk to
[1:38:39] him the fell said that time said don't
[1:38:42] try counting
[1:38:44] sheep right one 2 3
[1:38:50] 8,43 talk to the shepherd right right
[1:38:54] yes sir he woke you up for some
[1:38:58] reason talk to him if nothing else just
[1:39:01] say and I walk through the house of
[1:39:03] Minion and just say Lord I love
[1:39:07] you
[1:39:09] amen just that's
[1:39:12] all get so pulled away till I can't even
[1:39:18] pray but I can still say I love you
[1:39:23] Lord forgive
[1:39:25] us be with everybody I go to the
[1:39:29] seats you know the
[1:39:31] needs then sometimes I can't do that and
[1:39:34] I just say I love
[1:39:37] you you ever do that with
[1:39:40] him have you ever told the Lord that you
[1:39:42] really love him and mean it I mean mean
[1:39:46] it that's right I doubt if some of you
[1:39:48] ever told your wife or husband that you
[1:39:50] loved them and meant it
[1:39:59] might solve a lot of
[1:40:03] problem your wife gets all upset at you
[1:40:06] or your husband gets all upset at you
[1:40:07] just look at say I love
[1:40:10] you that you're so pretty when you're
[1:40:19] mad might Sol a lot of problems
[1:40:25] you know hard tell anybody often they
[1:40:27] tell you they love you you ever tried it
[1:40:30] oh yeah you look at them little kids
[1:40:32] eyes and then man you know you got to
[1:40:34] whip them you got the stick you know you
[1:40:35] got to whip them and you look at her
[1:40:36] eyes and they look at it say Daddy I
[1:40:39] love

[1:40:51] let see if you going to love me when you
[1:40:53] through with us
[1:40:58] fighting maybe that's why the Lord has
[1:41:00] to chasen us
[1:41:05] sometime maybe he has to let us know he
[1:41:07] loves
[1:41:08] us you realize that we say we're sick
[1:41:12] and but you realize if you're sick and
[1:41:14] God healed
[1:41:16] you you realize that was one of his
[1:41:20] attributes and you know he had to let
[1:41:22] you be sick that's right or he could
[1:41:25] heal
[1:41:28] you little different what we think is
[1:41:31] it but I hope you get to point we'll car
[1:41:33] it on Wednesday night the real
[1:41:36] you is that soul that is within that
[1:41:40] body and that spirit is looking back at
[1:41:43] me through
[1:41:45] eyes but it's that real Soul down inside
[1:41:48] of there right does it thirst after God

[1:42:17] bring the
[1:42:19] virtues well then you can say no I I
[1:42:22] need patience I just get patience will
[1:42:24] help
[1:42:26] yourself tribulation work of patience
[1:42:28] what do you need me to do that won't
[1:42:32] work it's not knowledge of how much you
[1:42:34] can read in the
[1:42:36] pyramid so why don't you pray for a
[1:42:40] revelation a revelation can add a
[1:42:43] virtue amen you believe it let's Stand
[1:42:46] Together come on
[1:42:49] brother think on these things
[1:42:53] the real
[1:42:55] you is that
[1:42:57] Soul the real part of us that can be
[1:43:01] Eternal is that Soul only by this Soul
[1:43:05] being Eternal can ever my body think of
[1:43:07] being
[1:43:11] Eternal
[1:43:15] right what about it
[1:43:17] church have you ever met the real you
[1:43:25] what do you mean meet
[1:43:29] Maria I was thinking about somebody one
[1:43:32] time
[1:43:33] and the way they were acting and
[1:43:38] reacting the best way I can tell it all
[1:43:41] at once something
[1:43:42] happened and my vision became just like
[1:43:45] it stayed like this like I was looking
[1:43:47] at perenial or what you call it out here
[1:43:50] it didn't move but I just moved backward
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:56] and that hole was
[1:43:59] there and I backed
[1:44:02] up I looked at that person through a
[1:44:06] different set of
[1:44:10] eyes and I saw their
[1:44:15] desires it was better than
[1:44:18] mine I was ready to condemn
[1:44:25] right did the prophet one
[1:44:28] time get ready to go out and blast that
[1:44:30] woman and the Man in the
[1:44:32] restaurant and the Holy Spirit said come
[1:44:34] on a door I need to talk to
[1:44:39] you now did he go out there and scream
[1:44:42] and holler at her about drinking and the
[1:44:44] clothes she was wearing and the vulgar
[1:44:47] thing she was doing did that convert her
[1:44:53] no he went out there and told her what
[1:44:55] God said to
[1:44:56] him and said you want to kill
[1:45:00] her when look at your
[1:45:03] sins same
[1:45:06] thing the lady got
[1:45:10] converted
[1:45:12] right not preaching to bodies not
[1:45:14] preaching to Spirits it's preaching to
[1:45:18] souls the only way I know to do that is
[1:45:20] just keep preaching the truth of the
[1:45:22] goel El it'll contact you somewhere down
[1:45:25] the
[1:45:27] line or else you'll get offended at it

[1:50:15] Healer but I like his
[1:50:18] attitude he said because of the pain and
[1:50:20] the
[1:50:21] things he said it's made me very
[1:50:25] irritable

[1:50:33] why things happen to get us to realize
[1:50:36] hey wait a minute got just a little bit
[1:50:37] too
[1:50:39] much but I know a

[1:51:49] heart and to take away any problems

[2:04:28] just and
[2:04:30] I
[2:04:38] oh that's a good thought but the thought
[2:04:41] is not to be the got out of the way the
[2:04:42] thought is to get ourselves out of the
[2:04:43] way and let him have what he needs maybe
[2:04:47] we're in a case sometimes of sickness as
[2:04:49] the prophet said because he needs to
[2:04:51] contact

[2:04:55] you told me what this morning yes I did
[2:04:58] yes I want me to be still
[2:05:04] enough then maybe maybe he's working out
[2:05:08] what he needs to but we don't want to
[2:05:10] get in way but let's believe
[2:05:13] father you heard our sister Lord she
[2:05:17] just wants to get herself out of the way
[2:05:18] Lord that you could come and live in her
[2:05:21] life and cleanse everything out and make
[2:05:23] it right for you because we believe you
[2:05:27] Lord we would even be willing sometimes
[2:05:30] maybe to just get on out of the way and
[2:05:32] let things be wrong but that's not your
[2:05:34] way of doing things your way of doing
[2:05:36] things Is A Healer a deliverer a
