season sorry and and all them other things but you know what when you come here let your mind be took over by the Lord and let's get something from him you know we sing Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary and we know this is the sanctuary this is a place what is a sanctuary it's a place you can go not be bothered they have sanctuaries for animals where you can't hunt them you just let them live in their in their nature and you know live in the wild you have you have a sanctuary where you can go and and not be bothered well this is a place you can come and not be bothered unless you want to be be bothered by the devil we can we can so say boo to the devil but did you wake up this morning with your mind like I said on everything else besides the Lord well that's your choice if you did but if you didn't then you're going to get something today this is not a wasteful time we don't have time to waste time we do not have time to waste time this is a it's a trying time I know that um I know it's a Time Lord that you know we don't know this or that or the other and um but we know that one thing's for sure if we'll do what the word says he'll give us power to overcome everything that the devil throws at us doesn't matter what he throws at us you have something to fight him with amen I hope you want to do that sometimes I think we'd like the devil playing with us I don't like that guy playing with me no I don't either I want him to go somewhere else give somebody else a fit leave me alone and we'll do that if the Lord will permit that we just get inside that pavilionist the book of Psalms tell us Lord hide us in your Pavilion hide us from the storms of life hide us from what the devil's got coming he'll hide you if you'll let him amen let's remember announcements real quick everybody appreciate brother um Ryan doing the opening service and just that little calm calm way of approaching everything and and he does a good job I'll remember that brother Aaron will be preaching Wednesday night um that Bob and Louise are are there's a few things I think Christine's put online if you want to go to that link I think it's in WhatsApp and Facebook if you want to go there and watch some of the things that's going on your service will be not this coming Saturday but the next Saturday which will be the 28th at 3 o'clock brother Daryl Ward will be with us and we'll have one service on that Sunday and not an afternoon service all right remember February the 11th the Valentine's banquet uh please sign up downstairs need to do that several weeks we only got four weeks all right so several weeks before uh we need you to sign up so we can figure out what we got and who we got coming and uh we sure appreciate the ones that's already done the work uh Anna and at least in different ones that's already done some of the work and we pray that uh we'll that some of you will help if you will there and because we're gonna have a bigger group than we used than we used to have so but it will be fine everything will be well make sure you put on your best wear you some good wear you some good uh dress up clothes because you're gonna have pictures I forgot to mention that um is Olivia still doing it sister Olivia is taking pictures for us starting at four o'clock just like we always do for those of you that have not come before we will be taking pictures at four o'clock at the at the barn there at uh Hidden Acres all right so that will be at four o'clock sharp start taking pictures all right and then we will continue on with the night please sign up uh remember March 24th we have a wedding make sure you RSVP if you're going to go and that will be in Beaufort South Carolina for um sister Esther and brother Micah Curtis so uh continue to meet my sister Freda I just talked to she's feeling better so praise God for that uh she has good days and bad days but this is a good day all right and even in the bad days she still has a good day good positive attitude and we appreciate that we miss her here at the uh at church so we pray that she'll be able to uh to get better and come on so uh compare all these things in prayer keep the Halsey family in prayer with Kip they're having make a decision tomorrow I think they're still going to do that tomorrow make a decision so just keep praying God I was telling him last night when we were praying for the you if you look walk in that room and you look at that gentleman laying in the bed with what 20 tubes sticking in different places all over him that don't mean one thing to God not one thing to God that doesn't mean I you know we've seen it we've seen it worse we've seen him almost dead and they'd be brought back to life so that doesn't mean anything to God and it shouldn't mean anything to your faith we need to look past that look past that to where that God can heal in a in a moment or he can heal over time doesn't matter he's still the Healer and we appreciate God for being the Healer because man I tell you what as I get older and be 63 in a few days uh yeah even come quickly Lord Jesus I'm telling you yeah it's it's uh the effects of the curse is on all of us so um and you young ones you'll realize that Esther's going what is he talking about ask your mama as she dated when he gets back and tries and wants to sleep for about three days and you tell him he tells you to leave him alone because he's tired yeah that'll be the effects of the curse but you know what we're here I thought to break the effects of the curse so there's a provision somewhere in here in this message of the hour that's going to break that curse it's going to break that cycle of life and death life and death life and death because I thought we've already passed from Death unto life if we've already passed from Death under life we've already passed it all right so let's just realize that that that's what God's wanting to get us to see now and what we're talking about in this uh series on the son of man so let's uh let's go to the Lord in prayer I think that's all the announcements for right now uh we will be having Bible study this next month in February uh the first Saturday and then communion the first Sunday so let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord thank you for the day that you've given us we love you father for the things that you've given us Lord sometimes we don't sit and and think maybe sometimes we ought to go as one of the prophets did and go sit under a tree and just let you speak to Lord that still small voice spoke to Elijah Lord speak to us today Father let it be a still Small Voice way down deep inside where Satan can't get to it and Lord just tell us of the goodness and tell us of the promises that you've given to your bride Lord I pray this should be the ones that are sick father the ones that are sin sick Lord I pray that you should touch their soul lord light a fire under them Lord now I pray that you light a fire under us Lord that you'll Lord there be a Revival start out of Revelation and and Lord today we'll talk about knowledge father the knowledge of the Lord will fill the Earth to seeing Sky father you're so much greater than any scientist we we hold people in in up on pedestals as as we say on Earth as Einstein and and all the different ones that that have seemingly broke into the great Realms of science but Lord Jesus we know the one that created signs Lord the one that created all these things is living inside of us today now Lord I pray that just for a moment that we'll you'll break back our humanity and that you'll let us Lord see you in a moment because one moment in your presence is better than anything in this world has to offer father we pray that you just bless us now take care of us in the furtherness service Jesus name we pray amen all right let's continue where we were at this morning we'll skip a little bit through there uh to get to I want to get to knowledge this will be part 84 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so that that makes it personal the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Among Us all right because I'm gonna read the scripture that I read this morning and it seemed more real to me today than it did yesterday a few minutes ago than it did this morning Joel said I will restore unto you I never read it like that before you said boy preacher you're kind of well I'm a little slow I'm a little slow but he said I were restoring to you just like he said in Malachi 4 I behold I will send you Elijah the prophet so he's going to restore me I will restore you to you all these things so we're going to have a restoration brother Brown preach the restoration of the Bride tree and that's what we're looking at really the restoration the bright bright tree was a kind of a uh overlapping of the Statue of perfect man so the word was made flesh and talked among us and we beheld his glory to glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can go and be seated in the Lord had his blessings to the reading of the word we were talking about this morning we'll just cover a little bit more about this about adoption I hope that we see that that adoption is not your birth adoption is your placing so it's two different things but they connect everybody with me now I want you starting sleeping already take everybody get a fan there you go everybody get a fan and we know you fall asleep when your fan goes flying out of your hand so and then it hits your neighbor wakes them up and you see if they have brotherly kindness or not what a way to do it thank you Richard brother Aaron's not here to do it so you can stand in for your brother yeah thank you brother Richard thank you brother Richard he can play a bass but he can he can sure work that thing right there too all right Genesis 2 8 we're going to talk about knowledge we're going to talk about two types of knowledge we've been wanting to get to it for a long period of time and out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree talking about regular botany life but now he's talking about a tree of life in the midst of the Garden or the metal or as we were looking at on that chart as the center that's where God Wants to Rule he wants to rule the center he wants to be the center of your life he wants his life to be in the center of your life all right he does not want you just to have an anointing or do you have feel good or or or or I uh you know I I believe that up to a point that's not the way he wants he doesn't want us to believe it up to a point he wants to believe every word of God that proceedeth out of his mouth but there had to be a tree of knowledge of good and evil brother by him one time he called him he said it was the law of contrast because remember without Darkness light you wouldn't know what the difference was but then if you bring light in darkness goes away if you bring darkness in then that means there's not light there so there has to be a contrast that has to be good and evil because remember this tree of knowledge has good and evil both on it all right that tree of life doesn't deal with knowledge as man's knowledge this is in man's knowledge because listen to be honest Satan does not have he has knowledge but he doesn't have Holy Ghost knowledge okay he does he can't because he don't have the Holy Ghost he has an anointing knowledge he has a knowledge that he can make you do things he can make the world do things he can have the world make what make plastic uh when I was growing up there wasn't such thing as plastic bottles they couldn't make them there was no way to make them back then now look they made billions of these things all the time now and they just pour water in it and make every they have that uh um I can't remember but it's called some kind of mold but it makes they make any kind if you if you can make a mold for it they can make something but see that wasn't back in the 60s it was all what 10 cans you know what we used to kick the tin can I wonder what we're about to do what we do if we had to kick the plastic cup don't kick them very far but man you kick a can you kick it from here to the door if you if you needed to but that was because everything was made with tin cans well man came to a knowledge of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and he began to say hey I think I can make them old that will hold water I think I can make a mold I know Donnie does and I remember it too all of our cars man 55 56 57 Chevrolets and different things like that they didn't have any plastic in them metal everything was metal door handles knobs it was all mental why they didn't have the technology to make the plastic mold injection molding that's what I was trying to think of injection molding came along and now they can mold anything well let's go a little higher than that now man has done what he has now took a computer along with a printer and instead of printing stuff flat they printed 3D Josh has got a couple of them that's what he made the little statue of perfect man thing that he gave us it's a three-dimensional printer they took the same printer that we have that gives us flat copies and it makes whatever they make guns well those things now but now remember there's nothing new Under the Sun the computer was back in the Garden of Eden the car was back in the Garden of Eden and Jackson molding was back in the Garden of Eden because the plastic was back there it was just in minerals but what did it take it took man to do what bring that back together bring it together in another form and make a car and then he now he makes a car that used to weigh what the old cars used to weigh 95 000 pounds something like that well they weigh now about 2500. well they don't weigh much I mean even you come into aluminum you got aluminum Motors now you got aluminum list and you got all these things that are that are enhancing our life but remember this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil what we eat off of it kills us the more cars we put on the road the more chance you got to have a wreck the more guns they make the more chance you got to get killed and they make some vicious stuff now for war that you really don't want to be around here when they are unleash all that stuff that they're going to unleash you don't want to be here well it came from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil because man thinks he can get smart enough that he can survive that these billionaires can build these bunkers so they can why do you think all these rich folks are trying to get to Mars and trying to get to to the Moon they want to escape what's going to happen here they want to be able to have just a little sliver of Hope and be able to go to another world where God told us to a prophet that you got enough inside of you right now to go build a whole world and go live on it yet we want to lean to well we'll just we might can make it if we get to Mars yeah well you'll be about 500 years old when you get there so it's not going to be worth it anyway man's still going to get older you know then people are I'm sure that and and you know I was thinking the other day all the great people that's live but you take somebody like Steve Jobs that created Apple he spent billions of dollars to try to live just one more month to try to live just one more moment didn't do my bit of good he's still got whatever it was colon cancer or something and he passed away just wither to nothing but he tried man has tried and tried and tried to live forever when the whole the whole uh plan of God is is for us to live Eternal we had to start living like this but the whole plan the whole knowledge of God is is that we're going to live eat for an eternity if you have the new birth today you're definitely gonna you don't need a spaceship you don't need to create something and get in it and no you already got it God gave it to you when he put it your mom and daddy together brought you put a soul in there you made a choice God put his soul in now you're going to heaven now that is too simple no bro wait we need to take vitamins it's all right I take vitamins it's okay take vitamins don't think it's not it's good because you know what this junk that we eat now don't have a lot of vitamins in it all right but we want to be like everybody wants to be like you know we want to be like the children of Israel where the where they it's quoted in and it's not in the Bible but it's quoted in in Jewish uh lore that there was no bathrooms in the 40-year journey because what they ate which was Manna it became part of them absorbed in their body and they didn't have to use didn't have any waste well that's okay that's fine with me but I promise you one thing when Adam and Eve was in the Garden of Eden before the fall they didn't need it either what they ate was perfect that's what we're going back to we're going back to where we don't need a place that we need to have a restroom amen we don't need to have a place where we think we need we need you know we need to uh tissue to blow our nose and all this stuff I was thinking the other day if you just really just sat down and wrote uh wrote what we not going to need when we get to heaven try that I know me and Mom have sinus problems and I thought praise God I don't have to feel like I got a lump sticking in my throat 99 of the time I don't have to wake up hacking every time I won't have to even wake up so we gotta we can just do away with that nothing to do with sleep so we can do away with that nothing to do with work we can do away with that nothing to do with financing sorry bro John we don't have anything to do with that but the Bible says build up you treasure what not here but in heaven and I sure appreciate what he's doing too because we really do need to be good stewards of our money uh regardless of whether we have it or not God give it to us and we need to be good stewards of what any we you know the lady with the two mites she was a good Steward of what she had she had two minds she didn't have nothing she had too much she gave it all to God but she did have two mites and it's a good good story to see that and that brother John would bring it to us and we sure do appreciate him him standing in and doing it he could do it more often if he wanted to Isaiah 28 verse 9. Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine who them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast so who's he going to teach knowledge babies not so much uh it's talking to some people at work the other day and they were their their baby was a year old first Christmas you know well what are we going to get them I said it don't matter years for the first five years buy your kids gifts don't throw them away buying for Christmas then when they turn six take their toy box and turn it upside down and take them same thing and give it to them and they'll think it's just a brand new toy Jonas is like no no no but that's the way we are though see we become smart we become intelligent I don't want that I want the intelligence intelligence of God I want this one Isaiah said whom Whom Shall he teach knowledge me and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine me them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast Isaiah 53 10 by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many think about a man that that never went to school he shows up and to see a Galilee and he shows up in the Nazareth and he shows up over here you know like brother Brown said he don't have a school of divinity you don't have all these degrees and he shows up and they say something to him and he just the Bible says he says things and they don't have nothing else to say back to him he confounds the scholars even at 13 years old they were what they were confounded by the things that he said even at 13 years old why because he was God Almighty and human flesh but you and I should have the same thing in our in our mind the Bible tells us what do we do we study we're gonna we're gonna go to court tomorrow we're going to study we gotta go do the Bible tells you not even to study right go and I'll put in your mouth boy how many of us want to depend on that don't raise your hand because you ain't to the point yet neither am I I want to study these things out I want to figure out what I'm talking about no God said don't do that because you know what we do we figure things out our way that's why I'll read your scripture in a few minutes where the Lord Jesus said lean not on your own understanding lean not to your own understanding but use the what the knowledge of God this part of knowledge to me is so very important it's right down there to bottom it's really wide you and I have got to come to a knowledge of the truth not just like they come to acknowledge of the truth and say well that's false we become that knowledge of that truth because we're going to see in just a few minutes that God is going to put a spirit of wisdom in the church not in the world they're going to put a spirit of wisdom in the church through Apostles prophets pastors teachings evangelists that's just the way I see it deacons Elders in different ones that he's going to give us knowledge everybody wants all these different gifts there is a gift of knowledge all right by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify me for he shall bear my iniquity now we talked about this morning we don't have to pull the chart up we'll get through this real quick because I believe everybody understands what sanctification is that's what's happening now we are we are by the word of God we are going to see that we that Spirit realm is swept and garnished that that Spirit realm is where the unclean spirit is being able to try to move in because you can't get your soul if you're born again if you can't get your soul he's going to try and fight and fight and fight to get back in where he was at but you know what we're gonna fight fight not let him back in all right so sanctification is clean and set aside for service and remember when you look at sanctification that is signified by what read so it's pretty bloody it's not just real clean something it's sanctification is the red what what cleans you the blood of Jesus Christ is what cleans you up and keeps you clean all right so it's a messy thing and it is to all of us I hope we see that we're going through that process again Lord tear the rest of the things out Lord come into my house and not just not just put a new door in with a doorknob on both sides where he can get in when he wants to but come on into my living room come on into my kitchen come on into my bedroom tell me what needs to be cleaned out get in the corners get in the crevices do like that woman that lost her bees you know if during that time in in the in the Old Country they would wear beads and it would signify different things well if you lost one of them it was either you were a prostitute or you lost your husband well she lost remember one of her one of her little medallions and she searched a whole place and finally found it she I don't believe she just said I ain't worried about it I'll go to church when I need to I'm sorry go church when I wanted no cranny every place she looked for that coin and you know what she found it and she put that thing back on to restore her back you and I listen we're gonna fall we're gonna fail we're going to do wrong but let's pray to God that our doing wrong is not so close together right yeah I mean you know if you keep doing the same thing what's the what's the uh definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result no you're gonna get the same results every time amen and the worst thing you can do is to separate yourself if you're having trouble don't separate yourself from church folks from from believers don't do that you cannot and will not you will always fail we are sheep we're herd animals we need to be together we need to be able to Crown each other's shoulder and say did you go through this like yes I went through that and this is what I did this is what God did for me to help me in this journey all right listen folks we don't need to keep our secrets to ourselves we need to tell others brother Bob said tell how your fire got lit right if you can't do anything testify to somebody hey I used to be a drunk I used to be smoking a lot but there's not any different ones I used to smoke I couldn't I couldn't help myself well that's right you didn't help yourself you let God help yourself when you let God help yourself you quit doing the things that you used to do amen but what is this whole thing this whole all these virtues is summed up in this one quote brother man said right here being obedient to what God Said it's what brought the powers what's going to bring you power what brought virtue is obedience to the word of God and remember obedience is better than sacrifice oh you know like I said about the brother that said well I'm just going to work on Sundays and that whole Sunday that whole day I'm gonna work and get Triple time and uh it's gonna be hundreds of dollars and I'm gonna give it all to the mission field well he did not succeed very long in doing that he actually quit the church for a while and got in some bad shape and he's doing better now because you know what he changed his mind well I hope God's going to change his mind but he's now coming back to church and I hope he doesn't do that anymore because that wasn't for God but now it sounded good that did it not it sounded good hey if I work Sunday you can just see somebody you know the devil's sitting on your shoulder said yeah I feel I don't worry about going to church if you'll you'll get paid triple time because a lot of places pray you know time and a half for overtime and double time for for Sunday work so he'll get paid double and then I'll just give it all the missions that ain't what God wants that's not what he said to do because if you put God first and all these other things if he said that on Saturday maybe that wouldn't be too bad but everybody likes to put it on Sunday well I'll do it on Sunday well I got I'm gonna have my kid party on Sunday it won't matter I might go in there second poll let us see in church page according to mount California he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers I want to reiterate this is why we're this is the stage that we're all in right now doesn't matter where you at in God we all had to start realizing we were lost and that the Son of God the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes into our soul and then he starts working his way up that statue of perfect man and we're going to read this in a minute I didn't bring it out this morning because I was trying to fly to it and get to it but that tutor is the Holy Ghost and he's there to what train you by giving you Holy Ghost filled Preachers by giving you the prophet of God and giving you access to the message of the hour and listen to these brothers preach that's your tutor sure you've got the Holy Ghost that's inside of you but it's got to say brother Brown said it's got to say Amen to every word not just a few but every word that precedes a thousand mouth of God so that statue of a perfect man is to bring us to a place it's just like we were talking about this downstairs brother John um Porter's got a a son what's his name Jeffrey we met him at the at the wedding and uh he we go tall guy about that tall I wonder where you got that from and put your mom and dad together he'd be that tall but he's just a super nice guy but you could tell he had a shell he had something that was maybe like a little beef with something or of course he's a cop but they have their own attitude but still you could tell that there was something that was not flowing good that was something that you can tell when somebody's been hurt am I am I okay Lily that's kind of I didn't mean to call his name but but anyway pray for him that brother John said pray for him because what happened was after that after that um wedding he came to John and he said I thought all people were like so-and-so he had put every one of us in a bottle because he had been under a Ministry that was total legalism and this and that and the other and you'd know his name if I called him he's passed on now and that's okay he played his part but he he instilled in the people so much of a hardness till it was hard to break that shell but he said out of his own mouth that he had not met people like he met at that did you know he said that yeah your dad called me and told me the day afterwards and I'm gonna I'm gonna share it with you because I want you to pray for the brother because you know what that's God softening him up you and I all if you're not born again you've got a hard shell your hard shell but what did I tell you year you know well sermons are going Ezekiel brother Rob said he gives you a new heart and then he gives you a new spirit that's not the Holy Spirit that's the spirit to soften up your heart that's some where you can get along with yourself he does not get along with himself he does not get along with himself you could tell it there was something he was nice and cordial but there was some little something that I knew that maybe he was I thought maybe he had had an incident in his past life which he did but it was with meeting message Believers that were just really hard and they were always legalistic and always saying stuff bad about people and then he met all of us and I'm talking about all of us and everybody that was there that was Believers and he said I'd never seen that before in a group of people so see your life you go somewhere in life and you think man I'm nothing ain't nothing going on in my life there ain't nothing I mean I but I think I'll go to that I'll go that way so we'll go away and okay we'll go the wedding so you go to the wedding you have a good time just be yourself all right be the Holy Ghost you are and let that Holy Ghost what proceed out and then you go back home though and somebody calls you like brother John and says hey I want to thank you people well he told me but I don't know if you want to keep me secret or not but it's not now so here we go he never said don't tell nobody but he did say this morning he said keep praying for him because he's he he's on his way to heading toward getting softer because he had a real hard shell yeah well you know why because of your life and and I'm gonna say this will you like it or not you can't stay home and let your light shine you can't stay home and let your light shine you've got to get out and let people see your light so go to a wedding go to the funeral go to go to go to nobody's ever said anything wrong about going to birthday parties and and things like that you ought to go family reunions you ought to go why that right there may happen to wear one or two of you said one thing to this guy you've never seen a day in his life which I hadn't either and and speak to him and then all of a sudden something inside of him says Hey There is a real there's something besides what I've been dealing with during my young life and then brother John said really pray for him so we're going to pray for him and that that the Lord will softening up a little bit more now sometimes the Lord softens you up a different way than that he lets you go through a lot of stuff but somewhere in that in that Journey though somewhere you're going to meet somebody you're going to meet somebody and they're going to portray Christ and you're going to say wow so that's what I've been missing that everybody's not in this certain mold and we go through this certain tunnel and we're message people and and you know we're or all like this now we're different people but we all have the Holy Ghost that's born again and we can portray that and when the people really see the Holy Ghost it has to lead them to something if there's anything your brother has got to lead him to that but first and he did I hope he did well I'm praying he did listen when somebody when when I say well I hope but when somebody that's been that way comes and tells their dad your dad comes and tell and said hey I never met a people like that before they were really genuine people they didn't judge me for who I am they they judged me for my wife or for all these different things they took me as what I was well guess what then God took that little crack and he shined a light through it and when he shine a light through that crack it opened up his life and then we're praying now that God will give him a new heart give him a new spirit give him something soften him up some and you know what it'll produce life so I'm expecting to hear something from that story what are you saying brother wait well that's you the statue of perfect man you we walked I don't say it wasn't me it was a collective body of Believers that were there that each were helping each one of us were doing things I mean it was a wedding for them we weren't there for that wedding we were there for you brother y'all were going to get married anyway whether we were there or not but your brother was not going to get anything if we weren't there you ever thought about that sometimes we go to places say well we're just going to go you're going for a purpose the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord amen where you walk [Applause] but that's what we're under now we're under the we're under this we'll talk about the spirit of wisdom but I believe the spirit of wisdom brother Brown talks about coming back into the church the spirit of wisdom to do what to help us and lead us and guide us and to make us what a Powerhouse that Powerhouse I was talking about is that statue of a perfect man all of the virtues working in our life and you know what we weren't blackbirds that stuck peacock feathers because I'll promise you one thing if somebody's been hurt or if somebody's had a bad experience with message believers they know if you're sticking feathers in you and you're some kind of a of a uh fool or or some kind of somebody that's trying to hide something even though they don't have discernment of the Holy Ghost they got enough discernment in their life to know whether you're putting on or not and he knew we weren't putting on and that was what impressed him more than anything else so sorry we weren't there for your wedding we were there they were there for you brother listen I'm gonna tell you something y'all say what you want to about me I won't ever soul I know saved I won't ever show and I'm sorry if I'm so passionate that I step on your toes or step on somebody else's toes I want them say I told the Lord last night I said I want to not just fill with the Holy Ghost I want to put in action I want to not have to yeah clap we got enough problems it is but more filled with the Holy Ghost and and how that we can handle each other handle brotherly kindness how patience be patient with each other right we hadn't even got there yet but we got to have knowledge to know what's right and what's wrong now listen there's a knowledge out in the world to know right and wrong amen right I mean but now remember that's getting real foggy now the line between right and wrong in the world is getting real foggy because what the world calls right we consider wrong amen and then then they're right and wrong is not very far apart because they can do pretty much what they want to do and still say they're Christian in that world all right but we know better why do we know better because we don't just have a knowledge of the truth we are the truth have you ever thought about that we're the truth of this world there's no one else has truth but this word this bride of Jesus Christ we're the only people with truth so that's what we're living under now we're living under this manifestation of the Holy Ghost or the Tudor being in the church teaching us just how to be good Christians how to be a light to shine if you go to Walmart and and the other days and I usually if if somebody you know if we open the door for somebody I'll say well you know have a good day but there was this one lady open the door she was a younger lady I opened the door for her and I said God bless you this it just came out you know but sometimes you don't have to go to the chiropractor after that come on how many people ever said God bless them people don't do that they do the other stuff but we do that but see they're not expecting the world to do that they're expecting the world most of the time not even open the door for you but we open the door and say God bless you and mean it me to have a good day told of um a waitress the other day said God bless you you just have a good day we appreciate what you've done I mean we sat there for two or three hours in our booth so we gave her a good tip and and uh and told her thanks for your patience you know so so we we try to do that you say well that don't mean nothing to them you don't know that how many of you knew that her brother needed some help not one of you we all walked to their oblivious it was all lilium Zach Lily and Zach Lily and Zack one more time Lilly and Zach everything with Lily and Zach Lily come over here Zach come over here when there was a soul standing there that was watching everything we did and was impressed with the attitude that we took toward all that and how we helped and washed all 300 of those goblets of Janet's thank you all right I need some more Temperance and patience I'm sorry but Jim started washing them things and I thought how in the world could one person accumulate that many and I thought get it good and she did you took them all home put them up they had a place in your house somewhere didn't they in the living room okay all right that's a good place to put goblets but what am I trying to say you may think you're just absolutely nothing and nothing's going on in your life and then you have somebody to come up to you just out of the blue like brother John call me the next day said man y'all made an impression on my son I said what do you mean y'all he said oh y'all helping and what Janet did well she did a great job and then Julie helped June all Anna I mean um different ones helped that were there and it was just a unit working together wasn't it by fussing or complaining stuff about the goblins and they were all different how do you do that you know if it had been 300 of the same thing but it was 300 different cups anyway and Richard would enjoy taking communion out of them because they were big ones but but somebody was watching us think about that and I'm gonna say one more time Rachel did you know that did you know there was somebody watching somebody watching you different ones who were there working different ones who were doing things in the in the uh in the wedding because we were there for Lily and Zach but we weren't what a story to me that just make a whole sermon right there it's just we walked among them and they noticed that we were different and there was no flag now I'm watching y'all I'm watching I'm watching you no he was watching never said a word he was watching now tell them how many others we didn't get you know we didn't get a a um something from anybody else it was just happened to me Lily's brother but you don't know and I'll promise you one thing young kids young adults and old people people watching us people watching every move you make and we do make mistakes and we do sometimes do things that are they're a little bit different but remember God's watch and then the people are looking at you wanting to see God inside of you amen so you just remember that but now that what's going to be with the third pool you got to come up a little bit higher to where it's a revelation of the mystery that's never been told to man ever before because the statue of perfect man has been told the statue perfect man is plainly in second Peter Peter says add to your faith virtue and all the tempers patience that you'll get this divine nature of God and all these things need to be working in a Christian Life yeah but now when you come to this third point or the opening the mystery truce of the seven Thunders which is the Seven Seals then that comes up to the son of man which we're going to get to a little bit later are the chief headstone which he started as a Cornerstone but he will be now the one that will cap this whole thing off that will set down on top of you and be God on Earth in his fullness in the bride not in one person in the bride now he chose that we didn't he chose to bring it that way what's he gonna do bring back the church to the word because you see brother around him he's standing there and he's got he's got every denomination standing in front of him and he's trying to preach to bring the church back to the word of God one word One Faith one Lord one baptism and you got a baptism sitting over here you got Seventh-day Adventist over here you got Jehovah's Witness over here because he calls them all out right and you got all those things but to bring back the message or the word of God and then that becomes power because what power without character it's satanic what happened was they had the power in the first church age second and third but when you got to the fourth fifth sixth Church Aid and then even this church age is supposed to be everything the Resurrection coming back bringing back the word of God the prophet of God said it was dark the Bible said it was the darkest time ever to man it's this time right here why because the world's engross gross Darkness bad Darkness but this messenger what is he to do restore back the original Faith the resurrection faith and that's what we want we want that part of Resurrection Faith all right he'll take the message of Pentecost to turn the children to the faith of the fathers listen there's a difference in a child and a father now one day that child that Mom and Dad had became a father because of what period of time because of learning because of maturity that's the same way with me and you we it doesn't matter if we become babies we just know don't need to stay babies we need to mature and become fathers because he'll rebu look he'll rebuke them because they didn't keep this same faith that was back at the beginning that's why the prophet of God said that that messenger would look would tie up Loose Ends are loose doctrines that was preached between the fourth age fifth eighth sixth age man had diluted this word of God to where it was what I can speak in tongues to get the Holy Ghost and that's it I can be uh on church on Saturday and that's it even a Seventh-Day Adventist will still tell you that the mark of the beast is having church on Sunday I'll take it I'm gonna take Sunday okay you can take Saturday all you want to Sunday is the day we worship the resurrection but it took Elijah to do what to tell us though that that's wrong so leave that alone Seventh-day Adventist is not going to take a resurrection there'll be some that will be in a resurrection but they'll not cause a resurrection the Pentecostals will not cause a resurrection the Baptist will not cause and they will be in the resurrection but it will take a group of people that our hearts our soul has been turned back to the faith of the fathers what knowing that this message is it this message is right this message just doesn't have any any any discrepancies in it it's God's word to me and you through the mouth of a prophet because he turned it back to the faith of the fathers because remember John the Baptist turned from the old Testament to the new message read it right there with a new message that Jesus came up with came out with is what the Kingdom of Heaven is a hand you must be born again they didn't hear that in the Old Testament but he took John now the next Spirit of Elijah came to brother onto brother Branham and turned those hearts to the babies back to the Pentecostal fathers what so so God can work and so this can be fulfilled and here's the here's the one I was reading this morning but I want to read it like this and I will restore to you not to the world he'll restore to you the years that the locusts eat canker worm listen it's eat this message down and a lot of people let's eat the effects of this message it's not going to eat the message it's going to eat the effects of this message to the people it's so eroded it and convoluted it and made it all milky and well maybe brother round was wrong here and maybe there wasn't 12 people fell off of this and maybe that was a maybe that was a rocket you maybe so what were they doing they were pulling it apart again but I want to tell you I'm part of that I will restore because he's restoring it back to me the faith of the fathers and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied how are you going to eat in a tree that ain't nothing but a stump can you no you got to have a full mature tree that's got apples or whatever on the end of the on the end of the Vine and praise the name of the Lord your God that he hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed folks I won't you ever be ashamed of this gospel don't you ever be ashamed of this message there's something inside of you that should keep you from being ashamed of this message amen so let's go to this adoption real quick go by go buy it real fast because remember everybody understands we've been taught president's taught us for years and years and years on adoption a lot of people don't teach on adoption you know why because they don't understand it but it's really really simple you start out as a newborn baby in Christ you're part of the family of God but you're not going to get the car keys or you're not going to get the checkbook to the to the you know 10 million dollar uh business that your daddy owns all right you're gonna do like Dave said you're gonna clean toilets First You're Gonna Learn how where the bathrooms are at not where they're at how to clean them well then that's what God is God's the same way we're babies he cries we give them he gives us stuff but then we come up to a place where he says Hey grow up quit crying as soon as the boy was born he was the son of that family the father loved him listen if he give you the new birth he loved you he loved you but do you love him back the way that he loves you cause to love him back is to do this right to love him back to show your love well I just love the Lord well if you love him he said what do you do you'll keep my Commandments what is my commandment right there that's your commandment is to live Jesus Christ the father loved him then you get over in Galatians talk about tutors so then the father had so much work to do over the whole Kingdom he placed a tutor now that's the Holy Ghost to me and you the tutor is the teacher is the Holy Ghost now but you've got to be you can't you say well then I can make it on my own no you can't that tutor has to teach you through a five-fold Ministry according to the Bible all right so according to the Bible you've got to have a teacher anyone who knows that was the Old Testament rule a tutor Paul speaks about the law being just a tutor to bring us to Christ or an educator so it brought us to Christ and then what to do the Holy Ghost Inside of us teaches us and God leads us and guides us into all truth but yet the father didn't know what to do with him or he would be or what he would be when he growed up now listen Our Father does know what we're going to be we just don't know it that's why we got to strive to be better we got to strive to do the things of God but yet the father didn't know what to do with him or what he would be when he growed up then he keeps going on talk about if I'm wrong correct me what happened when to the Full Gospel Church you know what's he telling them he's telling look you guys had the Holy Ghost you had the Holy Ghost you still got the Holy Ghost you became Sons and Daughters of God but you didn't move on up with God you stayed right there you did look in other words you became malnourished you decided that milk's All I'm gonna drink they come sons and the Holy Ghost is a tutor to raise them in the admonition of God now as the tutor had been watching the children the church has been progressing coming up they've seen the age of birth born again that's right correct you're just as much a son as you ever will be when you're born again but the tutor bringing the word to the father then if the Father the tutor came to the father and the boy become about age of where the church ought to be now comes of age brightens up that brightened up season according to Time when the boy became a base the tutor came to the father what the what he's saying he said hey this is where this guy's worthy this son see the boy being a son already but yet if he wasn't a worthy son the father couldn't adopt him or place him in his own family he couldn't do it because the boy would run through what he had he was Restless he didn't have the ability to carry on the father's work so the father just let him go on being a son he already was a son but if he was a fine son he was about his father's business and the Tudor brought word to the father saying that the son is fine he's eligible he's all right then the father took the son out in the public place as a public testimony and he put a special robe on him and set him up before the people what was he doing he was giving him Authority he gave him Authority with God he wants to give you Authority well I don't know maybe I'll mess up you get these virtues and you won't mess up I said what he wants y'all don't leave the building on me okay and the father by doing this give the son the authority over his kingdom over his business and so forth the son had a right to go out and do certain things in the Kingdom with the same kind of authority that his father had wow now let's talk a minute we know what virtue is it's strength and power that's the first thing we've got to have is virtue we've got to have strength and power because listen when we get on down a little bit further what does the world say about knowledge the the world says knowledge is power reading I used to read a lot knowledge is power but you know what that knowledge created an atomic bomb one time that kills 200 and some thousand people right and we use it for electricity now and if it ever blows up we're in big trouble again Chernobyl Three Mile Island all the different things we think we've got everything figured out and then we missed something because we're human all right now listen God don't miss something you've got to realize today that he equips you and Powers you for what you need and you got to believe that even though you have kinks in your armor even though you do have things in your life that you got to overcome if you just keep striving you'll overcome them you'll have to It's just sometimes we quit we stop we get to a point and we go can't do it anymore well if you're a son and daughter of God you will do it if you're not you never was a virtuous woman is a crowned or a husband the crowning effect of Jesus Christ coming out of the grave is me and you bringing others out of the grave think about that when Jesus came out of the Grave he said all power and Heaven and Earth been given unto me now what did he tell him he said you go wait to be endued with what the power I have right you go away in Jerusalem to be endued with power that I have from on high because I'm coming back I'm not coming back in flesh I'm coming back in a spirit form and I'm going to enter you and you are going to be my bride you're going to be somebody that I'm going to work through the only way Jesus Christ got known around the world was by holy ghost-filled people because I'll promise you the devil's kids didn't want to have nothing to do with it all right but a virtuous woman is a crown or husband but she doesn't maketh ashamed as rottenness in his bone that's why that you look at the nicolaitan spirit that Jesus told him and said you've lost your first love he said but there's one thing I got with you I'm with you on this I hate the Nicholas in spirit I hate you Conquering the laity all right now to conquer the laity what do you got to have you got to have preachers that are cut that conquer first Satan has conquered preachers to preach the wrong message of the hour to preach false Doctrine and then guess what he's got you when he's got the ministry yeah man that's why we believe that the truth is the truth and then when we live in the truth and abide by the truth God's got to come on the scene and help us all right so let's look at knowledge real quick let's take a Peter 1 verse 5 and being besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge knowledge in the Greek means no sis or science or knowledge signifies in general intelligence understanding general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belonging to the more advanced why would it say that why would it say that because you can have knowledge that one plus one is two but that's not going to help you later on in life such belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as is seen in right living you see what that's been here that's been eroded moral living is now it doesn't matter you can be divorced three or four times you can be this you can be that you can do a little bit of this and a little bit of that well you ain't perfect neither am I you hear that all the time Jesus said be therefore perfect so I'm going to kind of let him handle that all right so we look at the two trees the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life Whom Shall teach he teach knowledge in Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine then there are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast it's not bad to be babies it's bad to stay babies now watch this knowledge real quick we'll close right here the fact or condition of knowing something look with familiarity that's the key you can know today how to build an atomic bomb that ain't got one thing to do with your Christian Life well I know how to that's okay do you know how to rightly divide the word of Truth are you familiar with what's being preached are you familiar with the voice of the seventh angel are you familiar with the voice of God to know that it's the voice of God not the voice of the other guy the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience our association I want to be guilty of being Jesus Christ by association let us be found worthy let us not be found in the alley let us be found worthy the fact or condition of being aware of something are you aware that this is the truth huh are you aware of that that this is the truth not a truth it's not part of it I don't like I don't want I don't disclude nobody but God told us what to do he told us what was right and what was wrong listen he he Ard him and he was going to do but he had to give him a choice he had to let them go on free moral agency but he knew what they were going to do as soon as he made the devil he knew what the devil was going to do but he did it anyway he did it to prove that he was God and that all this is going to evolve into living in me and you every bit of this all from beginning of time to right now let's look at this right here the circumstance or condition of apprehending Truth are facts the reasoning you say oh reasoning the Bible says come let us reason together that's your sins be not what Scarlet but there'd be white as snow listen what brother Brown said right here and then we'll close some of y'all have already checked out and then thirdly you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge judge what right from wrong you know the Bible tells us and we'll get into it later on where the Bible tells us that we'll judge angels that when you read in Revelations that when you see those Thrones you're setting on them you the person of you are sitting on those Thrones judging the world that's why the Bible says look Brothers should never take a brother to court that's almost Blasphemous to do that who greedy people is what it is amen I'm just telling you what the Bible said folks the Bible said do not take a brother to court in other words what you do bring it right here let's work it out how many of you brought your problems in there worked it out with brother Dale I didn't think so because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge just what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you've got Christian knowledge with you virtue and Faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong if you can lay aside all your Creeds all your unbelief everything that you claim you've done take claim you've done then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie see now you're getting knowledge that's Supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by God to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God now when you get to that add that to your faith when you get true virtue then add it to your faith when you can walk excuse me walk out here on the street live like a Christian act like a Christian that was my whole point that we had just a few minutes ago all right be a Christian add that to your faith when you have knowledge you say well I don't know whether the scripture is right or not now here's Acts 2 38. I don't know how to go about it with acts 28 19. hide on all right all right don't add nothing because you ain't got it yet what you gonna do because you haven't got knowledge enough to know of God yet that the Bible doesn't contradict itself leave it alone don't say no more about it see leave it alone and I wanted to interject right there where brother Brown told him on the Sixth Seal he said it's gone from you it's not for you right see leave it alone in other words what's happened to man between then and now they've made the seven uh Thunders seven people they made it seven virtues they've made the seals polygamy they've made this that and this why they didn't leave it alone they didn't let the spirit of wisdom which we'll talk about next week I'm gonna stop right here leave it alone don't try to push cause remember he's got a time and if this is the time if you like brother Brown said he said you see these scrap heaps of ministers that have went out Beyond God's program all right they were true ministers if they'd awaited year after year waited listen to the word of God listen to the tapes the books listen to good ministers but what do we want to do we want to be the popular guy we want to be I've seen this more often than anything is you know brother Brown said money women in popularity is three things that that'll destroy a minister popularity is to me I can see that more than all the other two it's popularity everybody wants to be top of the Heap and if they if they didn't get that Revelation you sure didn't get it because I supposed to get it I'm supposed to get it first don't tell me you got it I got it I'm supposed to get it first we've heard that before but when you can see but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that can see that by the revelation of God the whole word is rodent Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it only the knowledge of God can reveal it then when you get and say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith let's stand brother Brown prays and he says in the Statue of perfect man at the very end he said look he's praying he says Build Me Up O Lord into this let Christ be my head that works through me that working through me on my Foundation my faith is in him let virtue in all his Temperance patience Godless brotherly kindness work in Me O Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or drown denomination no denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out then I might be able to teach those there's nobody in this generation spoke the truth of knowledge like brother Brown did and he had a seventh grade education he taught like we did aunts and totes and Carries and taters and maters but he spoke the word of God because he had knowledge of the truth look but flow out that I might be able to teach those for God has said in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God each one of these stones are a material off of that one this is material of this each one of these virtues belonging to him and they're pouring out of him down through them down through them not just me brother Dale the ministers know laity because it's not going to work unless it works in the bride and we'll talk about it Sunday we'll talk about the spirit of wisdom because look brother Brown tells us the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost brings the church in and reveals what day you're living in just the same as Gabriel to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things do you understand now musicians come do you understand now because what where's the spirit of wisdom coming from Spirit of wisdom comes from the spirit of the Lord Spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord that's why that the Bible tells us not to take a brother to court there ought to be enough knowledge in this building to handle every situation that needs to be handled and not have to take somebody to court now listen there's a difference in that brother Dale told us this long long time ago there's a difference in somebody doing you wrong that's out there in the world because he's going to go get a lawyer he don't know no different so you need to get one but now somebody that's a Believer inside this building and and and you know you you think you've been slighted or we need to work that out here the problem is we tell everybody else but the people here they get quiet when you start talking like that I don't know what sometimes they don't hear me around but we do if we'll just be honest and look at each other and say hey I got a problem with you right and we take it in Holy Ghost love because see the spirit of wisdom is not going to move you unless you want to be moved you can stay a baby you can deny you can say and and I know I know for a fact I've heard people say that's just too deep for me now how in the world can God write a Bible how can my father and my mother do something to me that I don't understand that'd be really something against them too if they did something that they could they did something that made it where I couldn't understand nothing that's like telling your kid as the Bible says I want a fish Daddy and they give you a scorpion I need some bread Daddy and they give you a rock that's not what your father and mother is going to do your father-in-law is going to give you the best they're not going now they have to keep things from me because obviously from him for human purposes but just to just to make sure that they don't give you anything to to to to to further yourself in life that's wrong and God's not going to do that either not because I'm gonna write in this Bible and then say when I wait a minute that's not for you no it's for us you just got to make yourself available for it because I've heard some of you say that's just too deep for me I don't understand that you know what that's okay but a baby will say that but uh matura coming up from a teenager to a mature adult you're learning so you can't just it's not going to be all poured into you at one time brother Luis your ego will tell you for a fact he came here he had um been working up in and um he got him a job down here and uh with Joe and and brother Richard and he was going to a church and and the brother's fine I mean everything's good it's just that Luis was was he had heard you know about brother Dale he had heard about you know the the depth of the message and it scared him to death and we've had people do that they'll walk in here and three months later or two weeks later they're gone stick around if you got the Holy Ghost it's got to lead you in all truth Louise said I didn't understand nothing about what brother Dale was talking about he said but I stayed and I stayed and I stayed he said I didn't get the Holy Ghost so I came to this church wow why he said under Ministry and he sat there and kept sitting there kept sitting there it's kind of like us you know we want to be baptized but now don't put me in the water just give me a little you know give me a little no I want to go immerse me kill me that's what I want with the word of God I want it all or I don't want nothing and that's what you ought to think you ought to think the same thing but you know what you ask God say God I don't understand that man that's a lot of people said that about brother Brown Lord I don't understand what that man's saying but you said you'd never leave us or forsake us and if he moves on that means he left us no it means you left him because when he moves you move you know what brother Brown says when God moves you move he said when you stand still God's going to continue to move so you are hey I'm My Own Worst Enemy we all are if you don't understand something you just keep praying and keep praying and keep praying God's got to honor his word he's got to honor what he's already said he's got to adopt you you say no yes he does if he makes you a child of his then he's obligated but are you obligating yourself are you keeping yourself open for the word of God are you shutting the door and say I don't know about that I don't say Lord I don't understand at the moment but if you'll give me a little time that's what Louis said Lord give me a little time about three months later he said I started catching on that was three months that was pretty pretty slow and God had to meet him somewhere if you're a child of God God has to meet you somewhere he's got to he's obligated to his own children if you'll make yourself available thank God take me somewhere I want to know more about you but you know what I don't want to sit here and fight all the time I want to have some real good days strung in a row amen how many y'all want that a bunch of good days strong in a row yeah we'll have a good one and then oh I have a bad one now John they will have another bad one then you might have one day's kind of medium then you got a bad one and all of a sudden you'll pop up and say I got a good day no I want to strain them good days together because what's going to happen when we take a body change all them good days are going to be strung together for an eternity it's not gonna be up and down we don't even understand that how would you understand living somewhere for an eternity and not having an up and down day thank you ain't happening that's why we got to have this thing we've got to before it happens we got to believe it can happen we got to believe that God's already given us provision for the down days and the up days and he's God on the mountain is it God in the valley amen it takes two mountains to make a valley amen so we need to be on the house on the top of the mountain twice than we are in the valley but sometimes we let the devil throw us in the valley and throw us in another Valley and just keep throwing us in the valley let's don't strain let's don't have ups and downs let's say God tomorrow I'm going to start new I'm gonna start fresh Satan you are on alert whatever you got to say you're lying I've heard this all my life I'm not going to yield to it anymore I'm going to be a new creation a brand new man you say well that's just power positive thinking start there start there and then brother Brown sound ready to you many times where he said a positive mental attitude to any word of God will bring into path positive mental attitude a lot of those people got healed on that platform he said a prostitute you know what that is a prostitute that's got all that oh God forbid all that in their mind of what their background is and what they're doing all they did they walked up in brother Brown said you've got this you got this you got this and inside they said I don't know I don't understand this but I believe what he's saying he said she'd get her healing where a Christian would walk up to the platform a true born-again Christian and then worry about everything and lose their healing so a positive mental attitude will bring every promise of God to pass try that start with that and now I promise you it'll move over into the next day's good the next day is good even if it's bad it's good what do we consider bad we don't consider what the world considers bad I hope you don't well I'm having a bad day we all have bad days I know that but with God I thought he had a bomb a bombing Gilead a bomb that you can't buy from Young Living you can't buy it from Amway you can't buy it from Avon there's a bombing Gilead that he'll wipe over that and smooth that thing out and you know what he'll make your day a lot brighter let's sing a song God bless you let's have the knowledge of God [Music] Brad from heaven or feed me till I want no more here's my cup Lord fill it up and make me whole saying to him oh here's my cup Lord I lifted up Lord come and squish do you have a thirsty in your soul if you have a thirsty in your soul man fill it up with him oh bread from heaven feed me too I want no more here's my cup offering it up Lord lit up and make me home oh you know sometimes sometimes our cup is a little and a lot of it spills out foreign Sister Barbara when we sing this song she makes a perfect cup she throws her hands out like this and she makes a cup like that and that's thanks pour it in pour it in give it to me give me a little give me a little angle where it can not miss any of it and she holds that thing up and I imagine a lot of times brother Sister Barbara you know what he'll start filling up and it'll just saturate your brain and your head and help you with your problems you fill it up with everything else you fill it up with Facebook you fill it up with this you fill it up with yakking and talking you fill it up with letting the devil bother you let's let God do that now let's let him fill us up come and quit says [Music] here's my cup Lord fill it up and make me foreign [Music] here's my cup Lord here's me here's my life here's my empty vessel they know what he wants he wants empty vessels he wants something he can fill up like I said before we get filled up with everything else let's try to fill ourselves up with God let him fill our cup up and when he does it'll be all him and not the devil hey man pray for brother Aaron for Wednesday night uh this coming up weekend will be regular service I think we're voting on officers just pray for that and just bless Aaron uh he's probably back from Brother JT's but Luis and brother Bob let's keep up with them keep praying for them keep keep keep praying that the Lord will use them in whatever they're doing and uh and over there and uh and it'll help the young people that they'll understand how it is to live in another country and don't have all the fineries of Life available to you every day and it'll help us all I wish we could all do that because it'll change your life it'll make you uh um cherish more of what you got and not be so uh not be so frivolous with with what we have let's don't be frivolous with the word of God let's don't let any of that spill out if it does spill out let it spill out to somebody like Lily's brother Lord if I overflow help me help me to fill somebody else's cup up amen hey we're we're people that that we've got more than we think we've got that's what I want you to understand we we say oh we don't have nothing we don't have this again you walked into a room to go to a wedding having no idea that somebody was watching you you did your job you were you you did what you'd usually do you help and you do and you talk and you're nice to people that's all you did and you impacted somebody's life to me that's the greatest gift anybody can have is to be able to give something and you don't know you give it to not know one thing about giving it but you give it River what are you doing I mean what you know bubbling up out of the ground what are you doing it's just something inside of me that keeps pushing up keeps pushing that water out and then we were able to drink from it then the prophet was able to drink from it and the dear Lord we pray that the world will drink from it let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day that you give us we ask you Lord as we go home Lord that that will truly ask you Lord to fill our cup up over and over again Lord we're not going to exhaust you we're not going to make you tired Lord we're going to be that Powerhouse that you said to the prophet that we would be Lord a living breathing instrumentality of God the word might flesh in the end time Lord just be with us on the highways bless the ones that are sick be with the wife Lord as her recovery Lord begins Lord we pray that you just touch each one sister freedom and all the different ones that are not here Lord we keep them on our heart Lord all the time and we pray that we can all come back together Lord on Wednesday night and listen to what you have through brother Aaron Lord and then as we continue on Lord Brother Daryl Ward coming into the end of the month Lord we pray this should be with him give him Lord something to give to the people and the young people there on Saturday father I pray that you'll just bless each one forgive us of our sins take care of us Lord and lead us and guide us into all truth in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed Lord come and queen [Music]
