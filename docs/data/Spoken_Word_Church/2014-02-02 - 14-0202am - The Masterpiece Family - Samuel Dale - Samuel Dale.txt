Isaiah 53 remember the Lord willing Wade will be preaching this afternoon and brother fory will be preaching this coming Wednesday so remember these and keep them in mind um we had a real good time last night out at the Bible study you know had a good fellowship and uh remember now the fellowship meeting we had announced that it would be here in March but brother longor called and wanted to take the March meeting because of his meeting coming up in May you know that would be there because he always has the his meeting and so he wanted to have the one in March so it will be here in may now not in March we had announced that it would be here in March but it will not be it will be here in May and it will be at brother lorus in March so remember that we've had it on the internet announced our brother Joe has so everybody can see it remember the sick among us there many of that I know Anna's out this morning sick and sister Monica's out sick just remember all of these things my wife's still fighting about with her problem and stomach conditions and things and Satan just fighting on every hand and doing all to try to make everybody sick and then bringing all of the weather conditions that we couldn't have the the services are this past Wednesday but uh you know at least the Lord took care of us and kept us all safe we kitted brother Joe last night that we was going to name him 285 Solace because of getting stuck down there for 2 days on the expressway and that that was something but you know we we appreciate God though for being with everybody and he said people would just bring him chicken and bring him something to drink and and stuff like that and and all like that so we we really appreciate that but okay Isaiah 53 I miss any other announcements now the uh the uh banquet for the Valentine will be it's been announced to when it's to be but now not this Sunday but next Sunday is the cut off date on it now so if you're going to sign up to come it's got to be done by next Sunday if it don't then it's cut off because we got to know how many to order for and what to do okay all right Isaiah 53 Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and your love unto us we thank you for being you because that way we can depend on you we don't have to worry we just find out who you are by your word we check that we look into the word to see what it says about you and it gives us understanding of who you are and we thank you Lord and then in your word you turn back and try to get us to realize who we are so we're just depending upon you we ask you to forgive our sins cleanse us remember all the sick among us remember Anna sister Monica our Lord the different ones that are sick we pray that you would just touch each one because you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction just have your way Lord we thank you for your grace and guidance and keep us in Jesus name amen Isaiah 53 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he ha no no form formed our cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not other words we didn't want to even look at him if he was in the Masterpiece you know surely he had bore our grease and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him SMI Sten stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone up to his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all see it's all not Isaiah 53 now you'll get if you listen to the Masterpiece and see not a to sh is not all just pertaining to Jesus the the man Christ you know Jesus it goes into the bride all right he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he have opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shear as his dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his debt because he ha done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he ha put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed right back up above there who shall declare his generation but when that happens he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore I will divide him a portion with a great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he ha poured out his soul into death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bared the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said and we will get even to more things into to this on Isaiah and see that it's not just talking of Jesus the Flesh and is coming into the world but it's showing the whole amen Plan of Redemption everything from the beginning all the way to the ending that's right it's showing everything coming down in Isaiah 53 and that was the scripture that the prophet used when he was preaching the Masterpiece all right I ask you to listen to the Masterpiece or the seed not a with a Shook and uh you know that way you would have a a better understanding of what uh I'm trying to say and as I tell talking we was a little bit last night see I can put a quote up here on the screen and I told them I can change down underneath this quote to make it say what I want it to say that's right you know what and you read it and think it's paragraph 44 Masterpiece and it might not even be anything whatsoever but if you've read the book or listen to the tape you know whether or not what I'm saying is truth that's right all right and see that's why I desire for you to do that and and I got it a little rough there at the end I went back and listened to it I don't think my attitude was wrong but you probably did but I said listen to the Masterpiece or see not a with a Shook You Know by the next weekend and that way you know if not don't come because you're not interested in uh wanting to hear well that may be a little tough but uh the apology that I give is that I don't want to get into the category you're in cuz if your category is that well bless God ain't nobody going to tell me what to do well I don't want to get in that attitude so I won't be telling you what to do anymore brother Al is the only one in the church really that ever calls me and wants to know exactly what messages to read related to the things that I'm preaching so if you want to know any more you'll call me cuz I'm not going to get in the same attitude you're in of being that part I'm going to be what I can be but I still meant what I said that if you're not interested in listening then uh you know you're just you're creating problems all right so you take your little pey pad in P all you want to but now we want to talk and it'll be two or three maybe I don't know four or five Services I really don't know but we're going to talk about the Masterpiece family amen and we'll go through a lot of it to try to cover some things but what I want to do today is just start with it and and show you where we're going right kind of like I did with the uh predestination form is to just kind of cover it over all view and then we'll drop back and start picking up some of the things that is there but we were discussing it last night at the Bible study and and it's an odd way of brother brandham saying things if you ever notice when he got to the seed shall not be IR with a shook now that's the one in in Los Angeles uh because the one in Jeffersonville he said seed is not air with a shook uh you know and in doing that why did he title it like that why did he title it the seed is not air with a shook why was not his title the shook cannot be aired with a seed but he titled it that way then he when he preaches it again he titles it the same way you know that seed shall not be a with a Shook and why would he title it like that and then preach a message about the bride of Christ true see that you know it's he titled it the way he wanted it because that's exactly what he was showing the seed is not going to be hir with a Shook You know the shu's going into tribulation the Shu will stand to White Throne judgment that's right I'm talking about the dried up going on we're going to cover that today and get into it but see it won't be air and then why would he keep emphasizing throughout the message of Masterpiece and Seed not air with a shook that Matthew 24 is involved and that the whole world would be deceived did you catch that and listen to it he covers Matthew 24 see that it come a time see that it would deceive everything but the elect right see he's covering a message but what would make it so close right that if we're not careful we're going to be deceived by the way the Masterpiece comes come on you if you listen to the message you know he said it all right now why is it then and I'll say this and I'll get off of it right why is it then that you see in your message realm of people that you got a lot of Pentecostalism yeah right and I'm not against it cuz I believe in it firmly amen you know nobody in this building believes in manifestations greater than the man you're looking at right now because I've seen God I don't have to worry about that amen all right but my point is why does everybody want to deal with Pentecostalism and what I say about Pentecostalism is you want to be built up you want to run you want to do you want the Manifest and that's all well and good but what about the word brother asked me yesterday he said what do you think about this I said well brother the way I see most people of the message they have come up to a situation of like almost a pente Pentecostalism of just they don't want to go on with the word you know oh yeah they'll tell you they want to go on with the word but then you start talking about Daniel 70 weeks seals marriage and divorce seed Etc oh they just back up we don't want to get into them deep things we might get confused wouldn't that be Pentecostalism right because remember right the shu is just before the seed comes into view amen right and the seed's not going to denominate that's right CU if you heard the prophet on them he said there's no more denominations after this that's why he said you can't denominate this message right he said but they'll organize it into lady oia right is that a quote amen see organize the message in in other words stop what did he say about Pentecost he said isusa Street Pentecost cabbaged down on the word well then the way I look at the message people most of them are cabbaged down because they will not talk to you about anything other than their little realm of protection that they stay in all right but see could that be why I brother around says and using that that you could be deceived just leave that up to you but now think about it the Masterpiece family so let's just cover it as an overall View and then we will drop back and pick up the things of where the Prophet would speak of carriers and how that he would make the denominations carrier amen and he would make the prophets carriers and he would say Mary is not the seed she's a carrier sir why would he be talking like that if you listen to the message you heard him and let me say something while I'm at it when we get into the seed and start talking about it and we we speak about it a little Jesus in the scriptures he said unless that corn good to see our visitors with us come on in welcome he said there was a corn of wheat right unless the corn of wheat dies falls into the ground it'll abide alone right all right amen now corn he said a corn of wheat now there's difference in corn and wheat right right why is he saying a corn of wheat right amen have you ever looked up the word corn I mean you you ever just looked up the word no I know what it is I eat it all the time well that's real good but have you ever looked up what the word horn says I'm talking about in the the uh daglock you know some sometimes the right translation would be to say a grain of wheat amen because the word corn it says the an the original says grain right so now Jesus is right he's not saying a corn of Wheat and don't understand the difference between wheat and corn he's telling you about a grain of corn right and that'll be the whole point that we'll get at the message today one grain of corn goes into the ground right comes forth in a multiple form right y right amen but now when you start to plant again now we'll go through it and come down through the message when you start to plant again you still just planting one grain of wheat right no I plant a whole row a whole handful there's all each one of them is a grain they're not tied together they're self-sufficient that's right so it's a grain of wheat amen all right a grain of wheat as we always say to the visitors when they come you come one time we say welcome and you come two times you just part of it so that's we always do that but think about it now we read in Isaiah and talking about a masterpiece family all right this masterpiece family started out in the Garden of Eden amen when God created Adam and Eve amen right amen a masterpiece family right okay starting there then he put them behind the word amen that's right right amen they had his word to live by right all right he told them don't eat of this tree don't do this different things you know but they were fortified behind the word amen but from that what's reason it's a masterpiece family is because he created Adam and he created Adam according to Genesis male and female created he him amen all right then created he them see because Eve was in Adam right Amen in the original creation all right now God had to Smite the side of Adam or to operate as we call today more common language strike him and take out and he took Eve from Adam amen right all right as we get through it then you watch that's not a bad thing because that was the way that God intended for it to be because it would speak of all the other times amen because the the you remember the the reason or the the point behind the Masterpiece was when the prophet was saying that he had seen the statue that Michelangelo made of Moses and remember what it was it was a beautiful statue and thing but on the knee of that statue there is a a little Mark Mar you know like a little chip because Moses got so as behind the story he got so involved in seeing years and years and years of work sitting before him until he actually got beside himself and he said he hid it with a with the Chisel thing you know and said speak and see that's what made it a masterpiece no no doubt it was a great thing a great piece of art but yet what made it the Masterpiece was he got so involved until he seen what he had in his mind for years come on brother you know amen was finally sitting before him amen and he said speak all right so then we know that's what made it a masterpiece on we see what made it a masterpiece in the garden was when he put Adam to sleep and took from Adam and made Eve am didn't take from the like the rest of the animals were created they would be created male and female you know and all like that and and each one being different because he create the male he create the female but when he come to Adam he created Adam and he placed in Adam the male and female parts that was needed not outside the exteriors but in the spirit of Adam and when he smok Adam or put him to sleep took out that rib and made Eve then Eve was not a different creation amen she was a part of the original creation all right keep that in mind as we go along she was a part of the original she was part of Adam Adam said now she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh all right her DNA would have been what the same as Adam it would not have been Eve as a separate thing cuz he made her that way but he put her put them then behind the word and it was beautiful they were there in the garden that they could come down and God could come down and fellowship with with them in the cool of the evening and and have a wonderful time and they were in complete control of all animal life and all of the things because it had already said that in Genesis amen all right but the the part that made it a masterpiece was that he took from Adam right and made the Masterpiece or family placed it there behind the word yes all right but here comes Satan as he comes along and using the form of the Beast that it speaks of which was not a monkey neither was it a snake amen get all that out of your mind we don't believe in in uh Evolution like Darwin but we believe in Creative Evolution all right creative evolution is God created one and another one another one another one another one well then that's where Darwin could never find a link between man and the monkey that was his problem but if he'd read the Bible he would have found that there was a beast amen there in the garden amen the Bible says a serpent was the most sub of all Beast there's a difference serpent that's a snake Beast is an upright creature all right so that was the point of what was missed that's right and through the Beast you know Satan using that Beast he was able to get EV away from the word right amen that's true and she fell amen righten and when that fall came it brought all mankind under that lost condition amen all right then see that's why Paul tell him not for the women not to preach and things why because they were deceived right we don't have any problems amen we just stay with the word amen all right but see even though that happened it looked like a bad day when when Adam and Eve was put out of the garden and it was and they were on their way out with those bloody skins of the animals that had been placed upon them but as they were going out God said what Genesis 3:15 I will put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman and it'll bruise thy head and I'll bruise his heel th shall bruise his heel that was actually speaking in the Bible of the first time amen of the coming of Jesus Christ that's right all right because that was the promise that he would come and take away the sin of mankind that they had happened in the garden all right so then we know that God wasn't going to leave it right so that's why we titled Masterpiece family see he wasn't going to leave it that way right so he set out immediately to try to change things we come over and there was Cain and there was Abel the two that was born from and as we do then we see that they started worshiping right we come over to Noah it was working pretty good but yet still it was a conditional situation Adam and Eve was told don't eat of this you can eat of that right ate of the wrong that's caused a problem all right so then when it come over to Noah you're still under a conditional Covenant and man was having troubles all right then you jump over a little further into scripture and you find a man named Abraham it was Abram to start with his name was changed and made to Abraham and we see that God started with Abraham with an unconditional Covenant he said I've already done it he put Abraham to sleep when he gave him the Covenant and said I've already done it all right see then he's going to restore his Masterpiece family so he starts with Abraham and as he brings it to Abraham he then Abraham was a a great he's called the father of Faith you know we talk about Abraham's bosom you know that he calls it about the Old Testament it wasn't in his belly it's talking about his faith yes the faith that he had provided a place right all right but God wasn't going to let that Masterpiece that fell in the garden stay down so he started with Abraham and just like the Monument of Moses you know the the stature of Michaelangelo made he put it on a block Foundation right God started out now if you if you listened to the message I'm just looking down the page reading if you listen to the message Masterpiece see you not I with a shook you can follow me right through all right and he started in Abraham to restore the Masterpiece on an unconditional Covenant because he knew man couldn't keep his covenants they couldn't do it he even had a lot of goof UPS under the unconditional you know a lot of problems in mankind but he put it on a foundation and that Foundation was what right the Patriarchs which is Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph right so he made a foundation right he's going to build a masterpiece amen he laid a foundation Abraham was Faith right Isaac love Jacob Grace absolutely right amen and Joseph Perfection amen why because you know the story back there in the Bible to the new ones just thinking on it Abraham is a father of faith so you put your foundation you draw it out you put it down Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Abraham was Faith Isaac was love why because that was the promised son that even though they messed up and trying to get it here with Hagar and everything else you finally turned out to be the love of God Amen down to to Bringing forth in Isaac then in Jacob Jacob was a Shyer Tripper uper deceiving his father deceiving everybody right stealing the birthrights doing all kind of thing right but yet God had Grace upon Jacob that's right amen God took care of Jacob amen God brought Jacob back from his journey when he was leaving going away cuz his brother was wanting to kill him and we there in the Bible in Genesis read it am and he was doing it it was Grace yes all right but Joseph turn out to be Perfection amen because Joseph was a perfect type of Christ right right come on in other words an example of Christ amen showing Christ and he was Perfection the only flaw that you find in Joseph's life is the one that he done which remember they were sheep herders they was coming down to Egypt Egyptians hated sheep herders remember all the whole story how they was out and Joseph finally made contact with his Brethren and he brought his daddy in he told his daddy he said tell them Egyptians that your cattle risers don't tell them you're sheep herders in other words there was no way that they wouldn't going to find out they were but at least let me get a little chance to get things settled with all these Egyptians around here and Me In Charge cuz remember Joseph was the number two man in Egypt he'd been sold into slavery but he he wound up being LA and bow the KNE to Joseph all right but he said now you just uh you just tell them that you're cattle herders and after a while we can bring the Sheep down but we're not going to bring them down right now we're going to leave them out there because we don't want to get and people mad at us right and see that was his flaw so there's another Mark there's another strike but yet it it made a perfect Foundation amen all right through the Patriarchs as we call but then the the body work of this masterpiece was the prophets right the prophets built the body as we would call it you remember in Hebrews u 10 five said a body thou Hast prepared me all right in an example form to show then we come down through and that Old Testament as those prophets as they begin to bring the word thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord the word was being built it winds up coming down all the way through those prophets they were actually bringing forth a conditional situation that God could walk upon to make a perfect Masterpiece all right so they were building him a body right right the last one in the Old Testament was who John the Baptist John the Baptist was a l one yeah right he come to do what what was John's job was to introduce the perfect Masterpiece of all masterpieces right got you remember he introduced Jesus Christ right you remember when he was on the the out in the water he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen he was the head of all the Old Testament people amen right and see there stands then your perfect Masterpiece amen all right almighty God in human flesh not a second person or a third person or anything go with we don't believe in trinitarianism right we don't believe in the the doctrine of God in three persons Blessed Trinity co-equal and coeternal don't believe that cuz it's ain't even sensible How could a father be the same age of a son see father son Holy Ghost Co equal coeternal I ain't even sensible I ain't nowh in the Bible amen that's right Jesus said unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins amen he was either almighty God in human flesh or he was a liar right amen right well see then he the Masterpiece stood there he took him and and went through his life and he lived his life for you and I amen God wanted to know what it was like to feel pain right he couldn't feel pain he couldn't feel those things as in his existence as Elohim self-existing almighty God Spirit God as we'd call him or whatever right and he he couldn't feel it so he had to come down in human flesh yes Amen to be able to live in human flesh am the Bible calls him my brother amen he calls him my redeemer My Kinsman yes God come down in human flesh that's why it says you know in Isaiah the Virgin shall conceive and that it would be Emmanuel as we coming on over into the New Testament to pick it up God With Us well brother Dale I've always been taught he was a second person yeah you've been taught that because that you you ain't never studied the truth of the word amen well who are you to tell I ain't me I'm just I'm just telling you what the Bible says the Bible said he was Emmanuel God With Us well now it was a Son of God now show me in the where it's ever talked about God the son I want a scripture for that I want a scripture where it says God a son there's no such thing they called him Son of God right why because that's who he was who are you by the new birth do you not believe that the new birth puts God in you well then are you not Sons and Daughters of God well there any problem with Jesus being God no the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily right well see then that was the Masterpiece that was standing there that Old Testament gave birth as we' call it they laid the word down put that word in order all of those prophets coming up was just one on the other stacking up stacking up coming up with the word until you come to John to introduce but see then when he come into the world what did he do three and A2 years are the worst Ministry could ever be thought of him right constantly trying their best to kill him for what they said you're a man making yourself God no that was back exactly backwards he was God making himself a man he was coming on Earth that's why we don't believe we believe in the one true and living God not to God in three persons Blessed Trinity show me the TR word Trinity in the Bible that's right it's it's not there but he bringing a masterpiece a masterpiece was standing there but yet before it got too far into his ministry what did he say he himself said as I was covering to start with that a grain or a corn of wheat unless it dies and goes into the ground it'll abide alone which meant was showing that he would have to die y right right right so he came to taste death for you and I to take death and Conquer it all right so then when he did he said that corn of whe is going to have to go in the ground or else it's going to B alone that's right well he was prophesying of his own death that would have to come amen that's all right he winds up on Mount Transfiguration where even God himself Witnesses down this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him amen Matthew 17 and as he does he's there but remember now to be the Masterpiece you're going to have to have the SMY amen that's right because you had to have the removal of Eve from Adam to make it a masterpiece family so if he abided alone there wouldn't be anything else so what had to happen he had to be taken to Calvary to be smitten amen right why did he have to be smitten cuz you and I was in him amen right remember we didn't come here with him and us as people are trying to say we came here in him in the eternal life that he has it's dwelling in you and I by the new birth all right so he was smitten that the bride could come out am that's right all right see where the bride that was in him because that would be the same with Adam Eve was removed from Adam to make a family right so to be a masterpiece family see then when Jesus Christ was crucified you and I the spiritual part of you and I of the the eternal life not our physical beings or what we are or something but that was in Jesus Christ and had to be removed amen cuz remember that when he come up there he was to speak right when he was smitten you remember Moses Michelangelo got so excited he hit that statue and he said speak cuz he's seen there in front of him all of his years's work all those toiling hours of year after year of slowly working on that Monument it's not no 40 stories tall it didn't take him that long that way it was just a fact his sister's kind of a small little bitty thing you know I mean I don't know exactly but he 3 or 4 foot tall is all it is but he put all of his life working in that and when he seen his whole mind right there in view of what he saw like they said somebody asked him said when he bought got the stone you know said well what do you all I see is a chunk of stone you know he said I see Moses cuz that was in his mind what Moses looked like nobody knowed what he looked like but in his mind he he visualized it when he did it was finished all right so it is in Jesus Christ he had to be smitten for you and I to come out amen but when he was smitten remember in Moses mes he said speak well I'll get back to it one of these years I'll preached on it before you know it the thing's in Reverse when you go through the Life of Christ because when you wind up at the end of The Life of Christ he smitten the calvary when does he speak right you had to come in Bride for him to speak right that's right right so that means there's more to come you remember amen Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph could put a foundation there's more to come amen the prophets built a body there's more to come right he had to stand on Earth but there's more to come because it's a master oface family yes see he was smitten at Calvary that you and I could come forth because that's where they received eternal life on the day of Pentecost right that's right a masterpiece family amen he had a wonderful church built upon the word right he had his Masterpiece in Jesus Christ right standing there but then when you put it on the day of Pentecost brother brandham says what said there's his Masterpiece family and it was a beautiful Masterpiece family that he had but there was another saying that had to come into being because when Jesus was here he said unless a corn of wheat die and go into the ground said it'll B alone right Joel had already spoken it right I will restore the years of the Locust canor pomor caterpillar it already been said by the prophets so somebody's got a fulfill it and did you hear this part that was in there as you listening brother said the Old Testament was made manifest by Jesus Christ you remember that now absolutely all right but he said in dire would come forth a masterpiece in the New Testament and it's up to the bride of Christ to fulfill the New Testament right you remember that statement cuz see that's what's taking place coming to the point that it would be talking about the son of man who was that Jesus said unless you believe that I am he all right then he talk who who do Man say that I am the son of man was who he was right the son of man had to die on Calvary the word made flesh went to Calvary all right so then it would start off on the Masterpiece that she would start off as being on the day of Pentecost to make the New Testament come into being it's going to have to wind up with a son of man all right so we have to hold that till we get down but yet there she comes forth and she's the word but that word's got to go into the ground or you and I wouldn't be here right so in the Dark Ages it began to go into the ground when the Catholic Church took when the bride the prophet said and you heard it over and over I know people don't agree with that totally but that's what he said he said the bride went into the ground at n you he said she started taking dogmas and ideas and opinions and things right but yet a lot of people say well no what they' done is yeah they went up there and they left and come back but they brought back with them that's right that seed was already planted at that first Nan Council because the argument at Nan Council was not over one God or three Gods it was over the fact of whether Jesus was God or a like substance study your 325 ad in your nan counsil and see even they wrote the decree that Jesus was almighty God but yet the word had already been planted in unbelief it didn't been put into the mind you say into the bride your Prophet said the bride went into the ground at n see a Rome why she had to go into the ground come on yeah but what I believe it was that they killed them all no how come they wound up being so far off the word that's it right until Luther come out with a just you live by faith looks like somebody would have held on to something yeah from Martin over to Luther looked like it held on to something but they didn't but you see Church your Prophet is when that says these things not me that the bride went into the ground at NAA she forfeited her right why because she like Eve come on she like Eve could not stay with the word it was not Adam it wasn't Adam's fault in the garden right Eve the Bible said was deceived said Adam was not deceived he knew exactly what he was doing see Jesus Christ wasn't deceived right but the early church started out beautiful and wonderful a masterpiece family yes but as it did she started dwindling away she started taking man's ideas amen opinions and getting away from the word of God until you get on over there it it comes into that for church age she's dying and going into the ground why because she's already began why because that's what Joel was saying that's what Joel was saying I will restore the years of the can of worm borm Locust caterpillar right right as it did that church at Rome she begin to not look too much like a masterpiece but don't worry about it she still was right do see everybody wants to bring a little bitty Channel down to there and they can't get to it we were talking about it last night I wish everybody would have been there to listen to what was said last night you take a corn of wheat we'll get to it later and come back when you plant wheat or corn either way you want to go with it the two shoots that comes up we'll get to it in a minute represented Luther right the just shall live by faith the stalk Wesley the shook Pentecost all right but don't cut that corn or that wheat heat plant down amen just because you look up at the top and think you got wheat cuz you could have a shook but even if you got a full head of wheat be careful when you cut it down and like I was trying to explain to them last night and a lot of them said they hadn't thought about it them two shoots that comes up you know the little PL they're green cuz life was there stalk comes up it's green it don't turn brown when it first comes up it's green cornner wheat either way you go yes that's right the leaves that come off your corn stays green until what sh comes on it's green right right y the husk could wheat is green the forming of the wheat in the husk right that's it's got to be there and totally formed and that's got to remain around it then it starts drying up right amen there's life there until then right amen see we got our own ideas we think well when they denominated they died you got quotes what about a prophet saying about 62 he said the Baptist is just now become a denomination you argue with him you argue with him when he calls the denominations carriers remember a carrier when it's a carrier is a work of God right just remember that stalk comes up that wheat when it starts forming it's still green stalk still green and all at once it starts drying up why because the wheat's being formed it's sucking all the life up into the wheat but you can't go cut it down CA it's half done Shuck's got to be there to protect it amen right that's right why because you're talking to about something being green a move of God and I've told you this before and this is what I believe see I don't believe the denominations was As Dead As you think until the when the and when the prophet brought his message then they started dying yeah that's right amen right they was still an ability to be saved out there right there was enough word being preached brother Ram never sent no Baptist message his Presbyterian to hell no that's right he said when they denominated they died right but does that mean everybody died you better look around folks you happen to be the ones coming from there that's right is it not true the prophet said if you Pentecostals won't go in said he raise up Baptist and M this look around right you better be careful how you cut down the stock you're going to cut yourself down that's right that's why people can't understand brother brandham when he would brag on the denomination he said there's nothing wrong with that he said but when they organize against the word right right he said it's not the people I'm against it's the what the system right that's right he went to the churches and preached to us amen right amen even the quote that I gave the other week that he said these young men will take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord come right out of a Pentecostal church and read right before then if he wouldn't talking about that church and those people that sitting there you see we think we got it all figured out oh when they denominated they died word rejectors go to hell but evidently you and I must or not have been word rejectors oh right go word rejectors go to hell right right amen when they turn down Jesus's message where did they go so evidently there must have been some little life around or something a little something who was ability to live see but we got it all figured out you hear preachers up pre them denominations they just died well most of them did but you know in there there was a little life left called you if not where did you come from come on see that's why I wanted you to listen to the message and see if your Prophet said it then it wouldn't be me writing what I want to or reading what I want to off of a page and putting it up here that you think he said it now you're going to have to argue whether he said it not me would you see church that bride she begin to denominate and die away oh no you don't like that I know that you read it and see what you got to say about it well it was just that little just them one bad ones that no he said their denominations and he calls them carriers that's up to you but listen he gets into restoration of the brid tree and what does he say talking about that little bride that died and went into the ground he said there was four messengers of death that took that down cankerworm palmerworm Locust caterpillar I know he uses uh a different word over in the restoration of bride tree don't worry about it it's same what it is and in the Bible pmer Worm but do you see what I'm getting at yes that bride had to go into the ground or you and I wouldn't be here it would already done be over with right that's right yes sir Martin St Martin taught the godhead the things of this message exactly right the Bible amen why couldn't God just have dropped down and brought the seals right to him put the chains of the body there and took them off he had a masterpiece family that's what your Prophet calls it he has no problem calling them and saying they the true bride denominator ated he has no trouble saying and no trouble saying that there was a masterpiece why can't see that well read and see if I'm right but you see four messengers of death took it down they started eating what one 18 to leaves one at the bark one8 the leaves one8 the fruit one ate the the sap out of the tree but it went down in the roots and The Roots didn't die just like in the fall of the year what happens everything starts turning brown starts going to way but where does the thing go down into the ground on a tree right are you with me four messengers of death but he said for messengers of Life restores the tree four messengers of life so you had four messengers of death they took it down they had to bark off they had to leaves off they had to the fruit and they ate the sap cleaned to it went into the ground as he was saying but he said in the ground was where it was at and he said you can't kill a gerti seed just because that this winter that trees went into the ground them apple trees peach trees Etc Oaks or whatever it didn't kill the whole tree did it sap went down in the ground spring of the year it come right back up and when it does everything will start being green again right but see he had a masterpiece family that went into the ground at n that's what I'm trying to get you to see cuz it was the full word right now you called it that the fullness of the word went into the ground but see then as it went into the ground there was for me of life and what was it all right what happened four messengers of Life what is those four messengers of life okay Luther brought just you live by faith the methodists come along with sanctification the Pentecostal come along with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but in the end time is to come back to the original word right amen four messengers of death four messengers of life to fulfill Joel that's right we ain't got time to read it you read Joel 2 23 through 30 through 32 and see if it's not talking about it amen it all went down bringing the tree down but there Li still in the bottom that's right all right and what happens so what did your Prophet say he said there four messengers of death killed the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree restore how by four Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley s by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost that's right right baptism of the Holy Ghost he said now paragraph 505 restoration of the Bride tree is where I'm reading from what was the fourth the word what the word there was four great prophets to bring the word back right amen did you read that part though Luther Wesley Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts that's all that's all people think that isusa street Pentecost was was restoration of gifts no it was the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right but yet in this message people teach that that that was not even a true thing onus Street why not you know why not because they're Pentecostal them themselves and they're lost go ahead and do what you want to cuz here's where he said it restoration of the Bride tree he says Pentecost what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the G gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word what the word that's right what is he say on questions and answers on the seal 63 324 paragraph 52 in each one of those ages only taken a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down listen that sounds like you're talking about him no uh-uh come on said no Messenger to the age cuz the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism so isusa Street had the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost not the upper room experience the outside of the 3000 we've been through all of that but what but at the end of the age that it always ends upon the other we find there then the messenger sent and all the Scruples and things would be making it ready for the Rapture look at this an off of Master peie if you listening to it paragraph 13 uh 6 justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right into Perfection back to the word again to the Masterpiece itself but see Luther had the baptism of the Holy Ghost of his day which was a just shall live by faith he wasn't required the other things Wesley come along you know Wesley believed Luther's message he was a missionary from Luther's message of the just shall live by faith Coming to America to convert the Heathen and you got over here in the moravians or every how you pronounce them they taught him the message of sanctification and he goes back home saying lo I went to America to convert the Heathen found out I was a heathen right why God opened the word and brought sanctification bringing sanctification the new birth of that age but then ausa Street 1906 Pentecost was the baptism of the Holy Ghost back like it was in the book of Acts your Prophet said I met people that had the Holy Ghost 50 years before I did but yet there's a lot of people believe that well them that Holy Ghost you got ain't nothing just an anointing there is people that are anointing right but he calls it the genuine Holy Spirit he calls it the fullness of the Holy Spirit to come on the zeusa street but where are we at no we just take what we want to believe that's what they' done at NAA they took what they wanted to believe and denominated and went in the ground so you and I are going to the grave again if we don't believe the truth that's why I told you 40 years ago in this s right that most of the people in this end time that believe the message was going to die and go by the grave that's right why do you think we've been here 40 years come on since the prophet was here to let a lot of us die and go by the grave amen but there's a lot of young people dying and going by the grave in this message too why cuz if I'm not able to come to the place of where that the word can be made flesh in you and I if we're not able to we're going by the grave amen that's right I don't have to back up cuz I'm the guy that stood here in 74 and told you we could pass the year 226 and not break the prophet's message but people don't like that they like ain't nobody believe we going to be around here in 2000 I told you we would I still got the tape to prove it but yet that's exalted so what Dum donkey tells you the truth what's wrong with the truth right I no problems with it it truth is truth but you see I was preaching this in the 60s too starting in 68 first message was what the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man made manifest in the last days the fullness of the godhead bodily would be in the bride that's what your Prophet said that's right see I've been pointing at this for ever since about 1968 69 come on trying my best to get you and I to see who we are amen there's going to be a masterpiece family right come on there's going to be a masterpiece family four messengers of death took it down four messengers of righteousness restore her back again what is it Luther Wesley Pentecost and then the word through the prophet why we have to stay around here the four stages we get into the seals or what you got your white horse rider you red horse rider you black horse rider and you pale horse rider those are Riders of death but you got the truth of restore right amen amen right right four messengers of death four messengers of life right but you see when we come back to it the bride is to come to be the fullness of fulfill the New Testament all right what about this one did you hear this one on seed not air with a Shu where he said denominations has been the carriers a part of it part that is the word for it has been hid from the wise reformers are sealed away from them until the age of the Eagles plural we were listening to it last night we already listened to it twice when the Eagles appear everybody's got Eagles over their door they're not even Christians or whatever this is the eagle a we had to have a prophet to come come on Prophet to come to restore the word fourth wor cuz the fourth was an eagle right amen an eagle to come yes to bring the word there got to be Eagles to eat Eagle food yes amen what good is an eagle without an eagle to eat his food go out turn get one of them pretty little old dogs you got or a cat or a horse or a cow or whatever and kill it go throw it down in front of another cow we was talking about it the other day I was with somebody we had mules and horses and things we had an old cow to die one day or it was one of the animals there and we we were going to have to bury it you know do we're going to have to pull it down in the woods and dig a hole and bury the whatever it was a cow or a horse or whatever it was you know what we goofed up we walked up there with the horses and let them see the dead body they wouldn't pull it they bought they would not pull it you know what we had to do blindfold them we had to blindfold them mes to get them to pull that carcass you can't feed Eagle food to a bunch of chickens take a fresh Keel out and throw it in the chicken yard come on folks you got to have the Eagles here were we not called little messes little eaglets that's right amen so you see where we going you see where we started a masterpiece family would in the garden now we're coming back to a masterpiece family in this day what the word to become flesh again promised exactly Masterpiece 170 promised in Luke 17 in Malachi 4 and see if he didn't say in that message that the bride is to vindicate melachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 come on Amen one or two more the alpha has become Omega you remember that but do you remember this out of Masterpiece and he said here I was preaching the message and said the vision come to reality come on you remember what the vision he's talking about he's talking about when he saw the bride and he said she came into view is perfect he said that was the early church perfect Masterpiece he said but he said then he saw the church come into view which was a bunch of naked women yeah claiming to be a church right a church a lot of difference in church and a bride yeah amen but see he was all upset and down and out would but the one standing beside of him said but the bride will come into VI again he said I taught it in the message he went through Masterpiece he said I taught it in the message he said I caught it come on the reason she comes into view again is going to be a masterpiece family she comes into you again he said just exactly like the original yes he said the only problem was a few at the end was getting out of step and said I was hollering at them well a masterpiece family you know why it's a masterpiece family cuz did you hear this one let's see if I can find it did you hear this one in the masterpiece the first Eve that failed that was used in the second Reformation second coming as bringing forth a child now has become the true bride again the seed right back with the original word again the alpha is and Omega is the same he said I'm Alpha and Omega the first message and the second message is the same I'm Alpha and Omega did you hear this one let's see I'll find it here in a minute he said because she's of the same source she's the same creation you remember in the church age book where he said the bride was of the same Source believe it's 151 a masterpiece family the story of redemption going from what started to where you and I are at amen now I'll finish it with the F last one what the Bible says they without us can not be made perfect so all of those behind are depending on you and I that's right but just remember the stalk of corn get out there and look at it it don't turn brown until now you pull the corn off of it take it in the house and cook it right that's when it's ready to good to eat you know but when you let it dry on the stalk the stalk stays green until the full corn ready where that if it could it could be planted cuz see they don't do it now like we used to we used to leave it out there in the field until it totally dried it wasn't green we didn't gather it green cuz you gather it green throw it in the barn what are you going to get come on we had in the barn of corn you throw it in our green where you going to get a rotten stinking mess we put it in there it was capable right then to shut it off or sheld it off put it in the ground why CU it was back to original right you said but I just don't see it brother Dale I just don't see nobody with it who's got it I didn't write the book I didn't write the Bible come on and I don't make excuses come on but I tell the truth come on Jesus couldn't do Mighty miracles in a city why because of their unbelief Jesus Christ can't work today because of the unbelief that's right right that's right what unbelief when you say I don't see it that's unbelief I don't give a hoop where I can see it or not it's whether or not he said it amen he called me bride what what right have I got to do anything else the Bible calls me his wife what right have I got to do of saying anything other than what he says amen right he says I'm perfect what do you say well I don't see it well that's all right I don't see it in you either there no problem but I'm taking what he said it's not when you and I get to where we see it I thought we was what supposed to believe it that's right before we could ever see it we say seeing's believing no no no no believing got to come for seeing in the Bible you got to believe it if the Same Spirit that's right now of saying now listen we listening last night and heard him say the same Spirit or not before last I guess the Same Spirit today that's saying I don't see it I don't see the manifestations of God I don't see the things that would ought to be he said put you back there where Jesus was at he said you would have the same belief there right right whatever we're standing today is exactly where we've been standing in front of the Lord Jesus well I just don't think you're him now brother D I wouldn't do that you liar why because you're not believing it now right if we believe it now it means the spirit in US was back there to believe him but a masterpiece family yes that God said was going to come to pass and you never put it on conditions well and I firm believer too if we live like the devil we are the devil that's no problem you see me living like the devil you just walk up and say hey devil how you doing right but seeing the best we can do in stumbling and Fallen God looks down and don't see that cuz he can't see us he sees our sacrifice was that give me an excuse to go on doing wrong you hypocrite that's the best words I can say for you hypocrite to think you can get by who's wanting to get by had a dream last night most horrible thing I woke up I got up I said God is that me are you trying to tell me that's me if it is get rid of it you see cuz I want to be what he wants me to be I want to be like Mary you remember be it unto me according to Thy word wasn't that what Mary said come on musicians let's stand a perfect Masterpiece a perfect Plan of Salvation that God has revealed to you and I Amen to make known all things to you and I is't that wonderful amen isn't it wonderful to live in a day that we can understand it yes sir that's right that the Mysteries has been revealed but are we afraid of the Mysteries as I said a while ago are we afraid well let's don't step out on them now step out on what if the prophet preached it is simple come on that's right now what he didn't preach ain't no need of me trying to touch right they don't even talking about so things right because the prophet didn't preach it well because remember and I think now that's in Masterpiece I'm not certain Harvest Masterpiece he not a to shook he says or I was looking at yesterday he says nobody's got a right to say thus sayith the Lord except the prophet that's what he said he said nobody's has got a right to say thus sayth the Lord except a prophet I no problem with that because my dependence is upon whether or not he was God's prophet and then I don't have to worry about it see then we do then have thus sayth the Lord because he said if the bride don't have thus sayith the Lord she's going to stand still well now there's a lot of difference in having thus sayth the Lord and what he said he said nobody's got a right to speak and say thus sayith the Lord except a prophet but I can say what he says I am and be right true come on go ahead what we got 272 anybody have a need the alar is open [Music] my I lift it up that's our lives isn't it that's who we are
