[14:59] to be revealed to our hearts we love you
[15:02] and we thank you Father we've been
[15:04] talking for quite a while about the new
[15:06] birth and being born again in things
[15:09] Lord and we pray that you would just
[15:11] help us all to understand the things
[15:15] that are required of us and then the
[15:17] things that take place in our life we
[15:20] love you and we think you bless and
[15:22] guide each one remember the sick ones
[15:23] among us and just touch each one deliver
[15:26] and God in Jesus name Amen
[15:30] cardi sister Johnny's not here brother
[15:34] Doherty he's still having trouble with
[15:36] his eyesight so remember him to pray for
[15:39] him okay seasons two now we read this
[15:43] for quite a while but what are we
[15:44] talking about for by grace are you saved
[15:47] through faith and that not of yourselves
[15:51] it is the gift of God amen now let's go
[15:55] over to Joan of the coast we've been
[15:58] talking on salvation
[15:59] I like this of what it says in the Book
[16:02] of Jonah about this Jonah
[16:05] two and seven when my soul fainted
[16:08] within me I remembered the Lord and my
[16:11] prayer came in unto thee into thine holy
[16:15] temple they that observe lying vanities
[16:19] forsake their own mercy but I will
[16:22] sacrifice on unto thee with the voice of
[16:26] Thanksgiving I will pay that I have
[16:30] vowed salvation is of the Lord you may
[16:34] be seated
[16:35] the Lord that is blessing to the reading
[16:38] of the word and we've been for quite a
[16:41] while dealing with speaking on salvation
[16:45] now what we want to do now is to drop
[16:50] back and take our point and you know
[16:55] come forth in understanding about the
[16:59] new birth and the things and to be
[17:01] directed in that and now we're going to
[17:04] try to make it as though and I want you
[17:07] to think about this I hope to god that I
[17:12] can preach
[17:12] I've always said I had rather go to life
[17:17] finding out that I had something you
[17:21] know all of my time and all like that
[17:23] instead of going through life and
[17:25] finding out I didn't have it because you
[17:28] got a problem when you find out you
[17:29] didn't have it all right I want to try
[17:32] to preach salvation as simple as
[17:35] possible to where the children can
[17:37] understand but also the adults and I'd
[17:41] like to be able to preach it to worth it
[17:43] this is my goal to preach salvation to
[17:47] where everybody in the building and
[17:50] everybody that's listening in comes to a
[17:53] realization of their own selves of where
[17:57] they stand with God all right because
[18:01] that see salvation is the most important
[18:04] thing not our argument so well I believe
[18:06] this and I believe that we spent vast
[18:09] times trying to go through and you you
[18:13] go back and listen to the message and
[18:15] listen to the prophet in the way that
[18:17] he's describing it salvation is not
[18:21] speaking in tongues shouting glory
[18:23] hallelujah what is salvation salvation
[18:28] is the new birth all right and what is
[18:32] the new birth the Prophet said the new
[18:36] birth is the birth of the word or in
[18:40] other words a revelation of Jesus Christ
[18:41] personally to you is your new birth all
[18:46] right see then we need to to think on
[18:50] these things and and here is my point
[18:53] if I could preach it good enough to
[18:55] where that you can realize that you're
[18:57] lost then I reach my goal to appreciate
[19:00] to realize that you're saved it's a
[19:02] great help and a greater understanding
[19:03] that's I'm serious about saying it now
[19:07] and listen I'm not trying to preach to
[19:09] get you to find out you're saved that's
[19:12] between you and God
[19:13] that is totally between you and God it
[19:16] is not you or anybody else is between
[19:19] you and God but to find out it's you're
[19:21] lost and need to be saved
[19:24] well that would be the great opportunity
[19:26] for that person to come to salvation all
[19:31] right and see then I want to prove
[19:33] as simple as we can and you say well
[19:35] brother Dale are you trying to tell me
[19:37] I'm lost
[19:38] that's exactly what I am trying to tell
[19:41] you that you're lost okay so no because
[19:49] if I can get you to realize you're lost
[19:51] a reasonable goal you said well you
[19:56] shouldn't be that way you need to bring
[19:58] us up and lift us up what good does it
[20:01] do to lift us up into something that we
[20:04] don't have no idea what it is what is
[20:10] the new birth brother branham Christ the
[20:12] mystery of God revealed the revelation
[20:14] of Jesus Christ personally to you and
[20:22] season it's not to you in somebody
[20:24] else's to you all right
[20:26] then the birth is the birth of the word
[20:29] I want you to get that more than
[20:31] anything else could because I thought
[20:34] what I've always believed it to be and
[20:36] what I've always taught it to me the new
[20:38] birds I believe your prophet was trying
[20:41] to teach us what the new birth is then
[20:44] it's the birth of the word all right
[20:47] it's took Jesus three and a half years
[20:50] to plant that word into those disciples
[20:56] and then when it did then come forth the
[21:00] new birth all right then you say well is
[21:05] it gonna take us three and a half here
[21:06] I've tried to explain that we're talking
[21:10] about it last night at Bible study see
[21:12] the first account or the point of our
[21:15] braiding it you got to bring it from the
[21:17] disciples cuz that's worth salvation and
[21:18] begin and it did take them three and a
[21:22] half years so now is that right it took
[21:26] them that long to be able to come to a
[21:28] position to be born again all right but
[21:32] that doesn't mean after the end because
[21:34] he after that happened like I say it
[21:38] over and over it could take three
[21:40] minutes or three years or ten years
[21:42] whatever for you to be saved all right
[21:45] the point is that see on the day of
[21:49] Pentecost 120 in the Upper Room it had
[21:52] taken them that long to come to that
[21:54] place to be where they could receive
[21:56] what was taking place but see then my
[22:04] knowledge of understanding or by
[22:07] thoughts and ideas you get 3000 outside
[22:10] and they can receive Jesus Christ you
[22:13] get the house that canoeists they can
[22:15] receive Jesus Christ you get all of
[22:17] those things that can just happen all at
[22:19] once and receive Jesus Christ and they
[22:22] can go through what it takes to make the
[22:26] new birth what does it take to make the
[22:28] new world good to see our visitor back
[22:31] there with us today then we say welcome
[22:34] she can't hear it what's you don't even
[22:37] hear it one of these days let's see
[22:41] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[22:44] the new birth is that word that's
[22:49] revealed to you all right now let's
[22:53] start as simple as we can to give
[22:57] understanding of this point all right
[23:00] now are you with me to follow me the
[23:03] first time it took three and a half
[23:05] years the next time it was just a our
[23:08] few hours or something sermon and do it
[23:11] we'll read some of that in a minute
[23:12] and they could receive the Holy Ghost
[23:14] why because they had at least heard a
[23:17] little bit of understanding all right
[23:22] now then in that it can move on in to
[23:26] giving understanding so don't think well
[23:29] brother Dale please you got a long time
[23:31] to be in your new birth no I believe
[23:33] you've got to be born again now whatever
[23:36] it takes
[23:39] how long it takes is none of my business
[23:43] that's your business that's between you
[23:46] and God that's your own personal
[23:48] experience of the new birth the you said
[23:53] well I believe the prophets message all
[23:56] right but that doesn't mean you're born
[23:59] again the devil believes it all right
[24:04] that's this blunt plain but this
[24:06] straight
[24:07] well I've got the only evidence I got I
[24:09] believe the probably meant I probably
[24:11] didn't say that is whether he said it's
[24:13] whether the spirit and you agrees with
[24:14] the word there's your final evidence
[24:17] that he brought forth as to give
[24:20] understanding all right he didn't do
[24:24] away with love he didn't do away with
[24:26] all of those things he just finally it
[24:30] come to a finality where he said the
[24:32] Lord showed him in a vision of what it
[24:35] is what the facts of the word the Holy
[24:41] Ghost inside of you making that word
[24:43] alive all right now the natural birth is
[24:48] the top of the spiritual birth okay and
[24:52] so that's where that Jesus starts with
[24:55] Nicodemus okay and he explains you know
[24:59] the new birth or you must be born again
[25:03] you must be born into water and I spirit
[25:08] right read your scriptures are all right
[25:12] as he gets to them to it or to Nicodemus
[25:15] to explain it then he's telling him the
[25:18] natural birth is the top of the
[25:20] spiritual birth the natural birth it
[25:23] takes what water blood life the
[25:29] spiritual birth it takes what that's why
[25:32] I said Jesus when he said it to
[25:35] Nicodemus Nicodemus was saying I can't
[25:38] understand you are you trying to say I
[25:40] got to go back to my mother's wound he
[25:43] said now if I tell you these things and
[25:44] you don't understand them what good is
[25:46] it good is it going to be me to explain
[25:48] spiritual things to you all right so he
[25:51] plainly
[25:52] you must be born of water and our spirit
[25:58] now he was plainly saying I have spent
[26:03] three-and-a-half years teaching the
[26:06] disciples the Word of God because what
[26:11] was he saying why didn't he say water
[26:14] blood and spirit he just says born of
[26:17] water and the spirit
[26:20] because we went to it explained that now
[26:22] because what the prophets say what the
[26:24] Bible say by the washing of the water of
[26:28] the word so the word is what was washing
[26:32] the disciples received the word take all
[26:35] the parables put you parables down how
[26:38] that the power was this power to take it
[26:40] and read you parables in the Gospels and
[26:43] you'll see what the new birth is it's
[26:45] the birth of the word it's the words you
[26:48] have taken the disciples the Bible said
[26:50] they took the word and one says it held
[26:53] it one said they kept it or something
[26:55] like that they've done that until the
[26:57] Holy Ghost failed when the Holy Ghost
[26:59] fell it fell on them that had heard the
[27:01] word all right so then faith cometh by
[27:07] hearing hearing by the word to be born
[27:10] again you're gonna have to start right
[27:13] we're not going to try to start with
[27:15] something much reading I keep saying it
[27:17] over and over you misunderstand me
[27:20] because I just make a statement and I
[27:22] know because yeah I try to cut down like
[27:25] messages instead of length in the mouth
[27:28] you think I'll run them out because you
[27:30] think I just hammer on something no I do
[27:34] have them on it because one thing's for
[27:37] sure you leave out of here you ain't
[27:40] gonna be able to say brother Dale didn't
[27:42] tell us what the new birth is well I
[27:47] don't know work out it or not yeah cuz I
[27:50] don't know well I've been told a new
[27:53] birth is it that's what we're talking
[27:55] about last night you know what's wrong
[27:56] with them I the majority of the
[27:59] Christian room you have been called a
[28:02] certain way or certain thoughts or
[28:04] certain ideas
[28:06] or some doctrinal idea and you take that
[28:09] as being the gospel instead of listening
[28:12] to the Word of God
[28:13] see that's why they couldn't understand
[28:15] brother Branham I can told you hee hee
[28:19] there he's preaching water baptism in
[28:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there
[28:23] are a lot of those people that were in
[28:25] that group that like 300 ministers a lot
[28:28] of those ministers there had been
[28:30] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:32] Christ if they were Pentecostal surely
[28:35] some of them fell in that class and
[28:39] there he was what would be against what
[28:44] would be against him brain because he
[28:49] was not bringing water baptism under
[28:51] regeneration because that's what a lot
[28:55] of them were already doing father son
[28:57] and holy God no Lord Jesus Christ but
[29:00] under regeneration because that's been a
[29:02] costal doctrine why and they was against
[29:06] that part all right but now let's get to
[29:07] the sea I want us to make it as simple
[29:11] as we can and start off where the
[29:13] children can understand alright so we
[29:17] can follow you know what is salvation
[29:20] now we went through a lot of things so
[29:23] let's go ahead and just pick up the
[29:24] scripture and read it and just look at
[29:29] the scripture so go ahead and pull up
[29:31] number 1 brothers we're not going to
[29:35] read the whole thing but you know what
[29:36] number you know what acts 2 is dealing
[29:39] with and when it starts and how that oh
[29:41] and the Holy Ghost had fell on the them
[29:45] in acts 1 and then you start into - is
[29:49] is coming forth of the Holy Ghost when
[29:53] they're explaining what it is all right
[29:56] so now listen to them explain it after
[30:01] they experienced it
[30:07] now are you seriously thinking with me
[30:10] what I mean here's Nicodemus and
[30:13] Nicodemus his idea is I've got him let
[30:17] go back to my mother's wound well what
[30:20] do you think the disciples believed come
[30:27] on think serious what did the disciples
[30:30] believe they couldn't have been much
[30:34] more above Nicodemus because they didn't
[30:38] get the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[30:39] until Jesus Christ died right they
[30:43] couldn't have so now let's go to them
[30:46] when they get the Holy Ghost and Peter
[30:48] describes the new birth okay let's think
[30:56] about what is being said
[30:58] now terrset like I said it now they
[31:01] Peter could have told you this before
[31:03] the Holy Ghost failed are you with me he
[31:09] could have told it but now after the
[31:11] Holy Ghost follows look what he said
[31:14] he's seen this before spake of the
[31:17] resurrection of Christ that his soul was
[31:19] not left in Hell neither his flesh did
[31:21] see corruption now go back and read as I
[31:24] said verse 1 all the way through get the
[31:26] background of what's happening there
[31:32] over here the Holy Ghost Falls and then
[31:36] Peter and them is over here in a minute
[31:38] then we're going to read and they'll say
[31:40] what must we do but I want you to follow
[31:43] the thought of what we're talking about
[31:46] this Jesus have God raised or of we're
[31:50] all witnesses now my point
[31:54] listen it's impossible if you believe
[32:00] the new birth is the birth of the word
[32:04] that's left up to you I believe it firm
[32:07] believer of it I believe you've got to
[32:10] have the word to be revealed to you and
[32:14] if that's true then then it's impossible
[32:17] to get to new birth without the word
[32:18] stone for
[32:22] it's impossible to get a corn to grow in
[32:28] the ground if you don't plant the seed
[32:30] is that straight it's impossible so
[32:34] let's get the seed planted and I said
[32:38] about Jesus they took him three and a
[32:39] half years to plant the seed okay no
[32:45] what's him now as he starts Peter is
[32:48] telling them his experience now listen
[32:55] these geezers have God raised up we're
[32:58] we're all witnesses therefore being by
[33:01] the right hand of God exalted and having
[33:04] received of the Father the promise of
[33:06] the Holy Ghost
[33:07] he has shed forth hid this whit which
[33:10] you now see and here for David is not
[33:14] ascended into the heavens when he said
[33:17] than to say if himself the Lord said
[33:19] unto my lord sit down my right hand
[33:21] until I make thy foes don't footstool
[33:23] therefore let all the house of Israel
[33:26] know assuredly that God hath made that
[33:30] same Jesus whom ye have crucified both
[33:36] Lord and Christ now Peter is laying down
[33:43] to them what has taken place you've
[33:47] crucified it you've done this well they
[33:52] could say well I wasn't there with him I
[33:54] had nothing to do that me that's the way
[33:57] we talk but he's telling them that now
[34:02] watch what takes place and when they
[34:08] heard this the message of Jesus Christ
[34:12] and his coming and giving his life go
[34:16] back to action - and read it all the way
[34:18] down you'll see that's what he's talking
[34:20] about that he's talking about Jesus
[34:23] Christ and who he is and what's taking
[34:26] place right now look what takes place
[34:30] and when they heard this when they heard
[34:33] them
[34:33] did you Peter it's alright faith cometh
[34:37] by hearing hearing by the word it's
[34:40] impossible to be born again unless you
[34:43] hear the word first okay is that closing
[34:49] straight enough well I didn't how well
[34:51] come on now and get off of the ceiling
[34:53] this nobody didn't teach me bless God I
[34:56] got it myself
[34:56] you read it out of a book so you got it
[35:00] from the one that wrote the book you
[35:03] know Bible whatever don't be silly with
[35:04] me on that part when they heard this
[35:07] they were pricked in their heart well
[35:13] when they heard about the Lord Jesus and
[35:17] what had happened are you following me
[35:20] Peter told them what had taken place and
[35:27] they were pricked in their heart okay
[35:30] now watch this we follow that point said
[35:33] unto Peter and to the rest of the
[35:34] Apostles men and brethren what shall we
[35:38] do are you listening they come to a
[35:49] knowledge a conscious state of something
[35:54] being wrong the word print is to pierce
[36:01] to prick to pierce to pain the mind
[36:08] there were something happening to your
[36:10] mind agitating that mind vehemently use
[36:16] especially of the emotions of sorrow so
[36:21] now when they heard about the Lord Jesus
[36:29] there was not great signs and wonders
[36:31] took place there were not great things
[36:36] going on Peter didn't say now you seen
[36:39] right here now we done raised four dead
[36:41] we doesn't that thing that happen oh he
[36:43] simply preached the sermon
[36:47] about the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:54] brah and what had happened up to where
[36:59] they were and they become pricked in
[37:04] their heart they become concerned do you
[37:13] remember the day you become concerned do
[37:18] you remember your first thoughts or
[37:20] contact about salvation or maybe you
[37:29] never was pricked in your heart maybe
[37:31] you never was concerned iswhat I'm
[37:34] saying it I want to appreciate the work
[37:37] that you've got to make up your mind to
[37:40] decide what you got whether it matches
[37:43] the Word of God or not
[37:46] that's why brother Branham says don't
[37:51] come on now don't go back in the
[37:55] congregation and try to get them people
[37:58] to come to the altar he said it would be
[38:03] twice harder the next time am i right
[38:07] now because I've been there that was 18
[38:14] years old my brother-in-law got killed
[38:16] in a car wreck and my sister she's
[38:18] always what and she always was a
[38:20] spiritual person she even felt God and
[38:23] things like that I'm not gonna argue
[38:25] with her about it but she came down and
[38:28] all and in the pews there where I was at
[38:31] and this is what she said she said Sam
[38:36] you know JC that he wasn't saved and
[38:40] said he's dead now and said he's in Hell
[38:43] and said you need to do something about
[38:45] it while you got a change well you know
[38:47] what she told everybody she was letter
[38:50] the Lord to come tell me that when your
[38:54] prophet said don't do that
[38:59] he says because you make them to where
[39:01] they're twice harder the next time to
[39:03] get them to come right you see was you
[39:12] pricked in your heart can you remember
[39:17] that can you remember when you started
[39:22] your journey of salvation because that's
[39:25] what we're trying to deal with right
[39:27] salvation is a journey being born again
[39:30] and all of that going through all it but
[39:35] do you remember when you first come to a
[39:40] conscious state or knowledge that you
[39:46] need to be saved what about it do you
[39:54] remember that well no I don't remember
[39:59] it well what happened you know because
[40:05] these when they come to a place that
[40:08] they were pricked in their heart about
[40:09] what had been told them about this Lord
[40:12] Jesus Christ and what he had went
[40:15] through what had happened to him had
[40:17] been crucified how the Holy Ghost had
[40:19] come back on them
[40:21] that's what Peters explaining had come
[40:23] back upon them and receive that new
[40:26] birth and they're out now being
[40:28] witnesses of what took place in their
[40:33] life now I know I'm hard and straight
[40:39] I'm plain if you don't remember where
[40:42] you started how do you know you started
[40:49] right
[40:50] if you don't know first off that you're
[40:55] lost how can you become saved well God
[41:03] does come
[41:04] down this dumped everything on meanness
[41:08] that's alright that's your problem they
[41:12] won't change you for what I'm saying
[41:13] because there's one thing for certain
[41:16] that pricking in the heart was not
[41:19] Peters words it was made are stirred by
[41:24] Peters words but something else had to
[41:28] take place what does it mean to be
[41:32] pricked in your heart what was what is
[41:36] the point when they become pricked in
[41:40] their heart about what had been taught
[41:43] them about the Lord Jesus and his life
[41:46] and his death and the things that had
[41:47] happened they become concerned right and
[41:53] as they become concerned and they said
[41:56] men and brethren what can we do I like
[42:02] it that away instead of what you think
[42:03] ought to be wrote there you think it
[42:05] ought to be wrote there what can we do
[42:07] to be saved now they were just standing
[42:09] there they didn't know what was going on
[42:11] except for one time they had become
[42:17] concerned in their heart something had
[42:21] happened to them because it had been
[42:26] brought to their knowledge by the
[42:30] disciples that had a witness that that
[42:33] this Lord Jesus Christ had died for
[42:35] their sins and that he had placed within
[42:41] them a call do you remember when he was
[42:50] called you remember when he was pricked
[42:54] in your heart you remember when you
[42:57] become concerned trying to talk to the
[43:03] children trying to talk you say brother
[43:05] daily so did he don't know I'm trying my
[43:08] best to break it right down to the baby
[43:10] form of what we're talking about
[43:16] you can't tell somebody how to be born
[43:19] again if you are not born again yourself
[43:27] is that simple enough well you could
[43:31] cause it yeah you could cause things to
[43:33] happen yeah but I'm talking about can
[43:35] you tell them what a new birth is what
[43:39] shall we do I like that better than just
[43:42] putting it what shall we do to be safe
[43:44] on that just want to know what can we do
[43:47] there's something happening that we're
[43:50] concerned you've brought our knowledge
[43:52] route to us the knowledge that this Lord
[43:55] Jesus Christ done all of these things
[43:57] died in our stead this is the message to
[44:03] the three thousand are you following me
[44:06] this is not the message to the Upper
[44:08] Room that's ax 1 X 2 you go down stars
[44:13] you go outside to the 3,000 of people
[44:16] that were just out there that had never
[44:19] heard about the Lord Jesus but when
[44:24] Peter got to his expressing about what
[44:27] this man had done they never just had
[44:31] never seen miracles they'd never seen
[44:33] signs and wonders to try to draw him the
[44:40] drawing was something else brother bob
[44:45] was hitting on this the other Linda's
[44:49] tee I mean the other day Sunday yeah
[44:54] what about it
[44:57] have you become pricked in your heart
[45:05] you see that's what
[45:07] telling you you can't convince people
[45:09] that's why brother Branham is telling
[45:11] you that you get people that they'll get
[45:17] up in front of a congregation they get
[45:18] people to move get them to do they now
[45:21] listen come on you're gonna get upset so
[45:23] go ahead
[45:24] you see preachers that can really bring
[45:27] people under a conviction preach things
[45:32] to do it I wish to God I can do that I'm
[45:35] not made that way but there are
[45:37] ministers I've watched him that could
[45:40] bring it it is like brother mote said
[45:41] one time he said these people were
[45:43] saying Redemption is over he said give
[45:45] me a hundred people and I'll show you he
[45:49] had that much confidence in his ability
[45:51] to contact people yet it was a deepest
[45:54] man in this message and I don't back off
[45:59] the yet he had a gift he could make kids
[46:04] weep their way to the altar it was a
[46:08] god-given gift because there's ministers
[46:10] who can do that see wives Peter it's not
[46:15] John it's not the eagle it's not the
[46:18] different ones if Peter Wright you
[46:24] remember there in the in the scripture
[46:25] in the book of Acts how that they had
[46:27] prayed for those people and praise one
[46:29] couldn't get the Holy Ghost come on them
[46:30] they sent up the for who it's for Peter
[46:33] and John I believe that's right now if I
[46:37] get the names wrong you put them
[46:38] together okay they sent for them to come
[46:41] down they come down spoke just a few
[46:44] words to the congregation the Holy Ghost
[46:46] fell on them there's people who know how
[46:53] to bring the presence of God to a
[46:57] congregation but I want to ask you
[47:06] another step did they continue on Billy
[47:11] Graham now I'm quoting your prophet okay
[47:16] you claim to believe him he
[47:19] said billy graham's that nobody had the
[47:21] ability that he had the Moriah because
[47:29] Billy Graham could bring thousands to
[47:32] the altar because he had a gift he could
[47:40] bring people weeping to the altar about
[47:42] their lives he said would you believe
[47:49] Billy Graham had a gift you're gonna
[47:53] argue with your prophet about what he
[47:55] said
[47:55] go right ahead help yourself I'm just
[47:58] gonna try to believe him because see all
[48:00] of those things always concern me when I
[48:04] hear a prophet say that Billy Graham has
[48:07] was said nobody can do it like him well
[48:10] you know what first off I got to do away
[48:13] with all of that other stuff that I
[48:14] thought he just whoo-hoo dude him up to
[48:17] it and he tricked him into it or her
[48:19] he's dead no he didn't get up and call
[48:21] out names now you need to come to the
[48:23] altar and you know you've done this and
[48:25] you don't you know Billy Graham didn't
[48:26] do that he got up there and preached it
[48:32] wasn't the other one that brought around
[48:33] was speaking up he said he can bring God
[48:36] one of you great men in his name and he
[48:39] said he can bring God I see Peter was
[48:44] chosen not John not under the rest
[48:50] Peter was chosen to bring the message
[48:53] because he had to gift his gift worked
[48:56] and he brought those people that had
[49:01] never heard a lot of them about the Lord
[49:04] Jesus but he brought him to a conscious
[49:07] state of what Jesus Christ had done and
[49:15] how he had died for them how he had
[49:18] saved
[49:19] you know everybody and had ever been at
[49:21] night he brought it to the understanding
[49:24] and those people then stood there
[49:26] pricked in their heart
[49:31] right concerned me do you remember when
[49:42] you first heard about Jesus do you
[49:52] remember that part can you go back in
[49:56] your life far enough to remember where
[49:59] you first contacted God now I don't mean
[50:06] you just thought about the first time
[50:07] you went to church most everybody would
[50:12] be here would be sad born and raised in
[50:13] church you know I'm asking you do you
[50:19] remember when you become pricked in your
[50:22] heart because that's the first stage
[50:26] the Prickett in your heart with the
[50:28] pricking in your heart is because at one
[50:30] time no man can come to God and unless
[50:40] he's called and remember many are called
[50:48] a few were children they're true let's
[50:59] hold that one right darkness for a
[51:00] second and jump over go to number three
[51:06] John 6 let's just read some scriptures
[51:10] cause you see something had to take
[51:13] place before they become totally pricked
[51:17] in their heart they had to get a
[51:20] knowledge and the knowledge tells you
[51:25] what was taking place now what did Jesus
[51:27] say no man can come to me except the
[51:33] Father which has sent me draw him and
[51:36] I'll raise him up at the last day now
[51:41] you can't come to God unless he calls
[51:43] you
[51:45] that's where the trouble is at that's
[51:47] what I'm trying to get you to see
[51:49] there's people with ability to contact
[51:52] people to get them to the altar and God
[51:55] deals with that and wonderful but
[51:57] because a lot of them come to the altar
[51:59] don't mean they're saved cuz you go back
[52:05] in the congregation now well now you
[52:07] know now - you know now your mama now
[52:10] yeah you know and that scare tactics
[52:12] like I said my sister comes she said you
[52:16] know JC was not saved and he's dead in
[52:20] Hell now and you better get straight
[52:22] well I'm serious is convened I've told
[52:25] you this before it's on tape I would
[52:27] have took his experience with God over
[52:30] hers you see were you to use that - what
[52:39] you want to use it for she was telling
[52:44] me he was lost if I'd have said anything
[52:47] to her I look back sure to look back at
[52:49] her and said let's mean you both go to
[52:51] the altar because you need to get saved
[52:54] first the Prophet said don't do that I
[53:00] mean see telling soft love stories don't
[53:07] get people saved oh jesus loves you you
[53:13] need to do this you need to do that
[53:15] talking to the children you think that's
[53:23] gonna save those children this in church
[53:27] that's what I'm saying
[53:28] if you remember you remember they done
[53:32] that to you and you remember it never
[53:37] took you to Jesus Christ ain't saying it
[53:42] won't I said it didn't - the majority
[53:46] and probably the one sitting here me
[53:50] talking to you if you'll open up your
[53:52] own conscience enough to be pricked in
[53:54] your heart to realize what taking place
[53:56] you realize that you've done that same
[53:58] thing
[53:59] people tried to get you to come to
[54:01] salvation
[54:05] yet they tried to bring you the wrong
[54:07] way
[54:17] Peter was bringing them the right way he
[54:20] gets to it in a minute where we have
[54:22] time to get in for not we'll do it
[54:23] Wednesday one I want to be it just gets
[54:27] it to you simple this can be if you
[54:31] remember your first contact in church
[54:38] are you you know whatever or where
[54:41] you're at and home or whatever anybody
[54:43] talking to you about the Lord Jesus do
[54:45] you remember that did it lead you to the
[54:50] Lord well I went to the altar and I
[54:56] repented did you go to the altar -
[55:02] because you know I'm serious and you can
[55:05] do what you want to if my sister - kept
[55:09] on how to walk to the altar - got her
[55:11] off my back I'm serious and straight
[55:17] whether you are or not
[55:19] I would have done that - got her off my
[55:21] back because I wasn't concerned with
[55:25] that there was no conviction in my heart
[55:33] and told you she needed to be an altar
[55:38] the Deacon board in the church needed to
[55:40] be an altar the church the Prophet said
[55:47] has always been the thing that stood
[55:49] before mankind and God instead of
[55:51] leading us to God right
[56:02] you don't talk to your kids about don't
[56:06] do this don't do that because Jesus
[56:09] loves you and he's mad at you you're
[56:16] trying to scare tactics and those things
[56:18] won't work
[56:21] sure tell them about the love of God
[56:24] that he said his life to work they could
[56:27] have an opportunity to be able to be
[56:29] saved
[56:29] tell them the good side about the story
[56:32] but don't tell them about it to try to
[56:34] fear them into it then getting very few
[56:41] amens because you know what I'm telling
[56:46] you is hitting what I'm saying it's you
[56:52] know it's hitting because you know where
[56:54] you come from you know what happened to
[56:57] you in your life just be serious one
[57:02] time about it you might find that you
[57:05] are lost because if the people to try to
[57:13] lead you to God could not bring a point
[57:17] of being your conviction as we call it
[57:20] upon you then then it's become a
[57:23] hindrance
[57:34] then if we don't believe salvation is
[57:37] emotional situation and heaven help you
[57:40] with what you're trying to figure out
[57:42] what I'm saying I believe in emotions
[57:45] more than anybody in this building I've
[57:48] witnessed more emotions than anybody I
[57:51] can talk to about because I can tell you
[57:54] about seeing the Lord I can tell you
[57:56] about seeing the angel of God I can tell
[57:58] you about things that happen I can tell
[58:00] you about the witnesses of what happened
[58:02] into my life season I don't back up I'll
[58:10] take it and just put it that straight
[58:15] have you ever really had an experience
[58:21] I've asked you to read the future home
[58:24] go read the first 15 18 pages over and
[58:28] over and over where the Prophet said
[58:32] that that justifications that all it
[58:35] does is chops off you pi sins this does
[58:39] nothing to your nature your ways or
[58:42] being but what about it go to John 6 it
[58:59] was John 5 number John 6
[59:02] and he said Darfur said I unto you that
[59:05] no man can come unto me except it were
[59:09] given unto him of my father
[59:19] now one of these days it will don't on
[59:21] us what the Prophet is saying which has
[59:23] always been one of the hardest things
[59:25] for me to follow you'll know what to
[59:30] hear the very fact of what the Bible
[59:34] said in the prophets it when it says no
[59:36] man assault god at any time you realize
[59:45] the Bible is telling you you never saw
[59:48] God the Bible the Prophet is telling you
[59:52] God saw you
[59:54] the Bible is telling you that the
[59:56] goodness of God leaders need in
[59:58] repentance the goodness of God something
[1:00:03] led you to repentance you realize it was
[1:00:10] God seeking you well brother Dale I
[1:00:12] remember when I cried enough right after
[1:00:14] I did too I remember two years after
[1:00:17] coming in this message that I'd listened
[1:00:20] to six books I mean read six books in
[1:00:22] one day and listen to two types all in
[1:00:24] that same one day I spent my whole life
[1:00:29] to learn this message because I knew if
[1:00:35] the message was right then I had the
[1:00:37] gold with in my hand I wanted the pearl
[1:00:40] of great price and I had it in my hand
[1:00:44] but the world didn't mean anything to me
[1:00:51] but I also knew that I wasn't born again
[1:00:55] and that's where we'll get to that one
[1:00:57] later we'll get back on like we said
[1:01:00] last night we talked about anointed ones
[1:01:04] you realized that there's no difference
[1:01:07] in the anointing of anointed ones and
[1:01:10] true born-again believers the anointing
[1:01:15] is the same would you admit brother Dale
[1:01:22] I'm an anointed one if you're not an
[1:01:26] anointed one you're not born again maybe
[1:01:31] get you listened to last night's message
[1:01:36] if you're not anointed with a genuine
[1:01:38] anointing of the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:01:41] born again
[1:01:43] Nova toxin or the ones rinses okay but
[1:01:49] look what he's saying Darfur said on to
[1:01:52] you that no man can come to me except it
[1:01:55] were given unto him of my father they
[1:02:03] surely didn't understand him right read
[1:02:09] the next verse from that time many of
[1:02:14] his disciples went back and walked no
[1:02:16] more with him they just like Nicodemus
[1:02:19] they didn't know what was going on and
[1:02:23] instead of staying with a man that had
[1:02:26] to plan as we call it I used to like
[1:02:30] that old brother would because I think
[1:02:31] it's among the black people use the
[1:02:35] slang you got to go where the stuffs
[1:02:36] they happen or something like that you
[1:02:38] got to get where the stuffs and other
[1:02:39] would be he'd always say he said you got
[1:02:41] to get with the one that's got to stuff
[1:02:43] you know look from that time many of his
[1:02:50] disciples were but then Jesus said unto
[1:02:54] the twelve will you also go away
[1:03:00] now you want what the Prophet said you
[1:03:05] remember what he said about that anybody
[1:03:09] won't quote it for me then said Jesus
[1:03:14] unto the twelve why don't you go also
[1:03:18] that's why brother Branham said they
[1:03:20] were sayin that Jesus was saying to them
[1:03:23] why don't you go to now that's your
[1:03:28] prophet that's where I love the Prophet
[1:03:30] he's got the answer we've got the
[1:03:33] questions look Simon Peter answered them
[1:03:36] Lord answered him Lord to whom shall we
[1:03:40] go that has the words of eternal life
[1:03:47] he finally come up with a statement
[1:03:49] enough to place it would own it and I
[1:03:52] like the Bible code of that let's see
[1:03:54] how is it go do you now believe when
[1:03:57] Jesus got so far he said do you now
[1:04:00] believe do you understand what I'm
[1:04:06] getting at what's the first step of
[1:04:10] salvation God calling you know I cried
[1:04:17] and prayed they took me to altar I don't
[1:04:18] even think so
[1:04:22] that ain't step number one step number
[1:04:29] one is whether or not if God is calling
[1:04:31] you yeah but he called everybody mm-hmm
[1:04:37] remember he chose the twelve and one of
[1:04:40] them was a devil even had him walking
[1:04:43] with Him in Judas he chose him to be
[1:04:48] part of the ministry gave him part of
[1:04:50] the ministry they cast out devils and
[1:04:52] all kind of things and that was Judas
[1:04:54] Iscariot do you remember where you
[1:05:04] started because that's Romans two and
[1:05:11] four words the goodness of God is what
[1:05:13] leads you to repentance it's the
[1:05:19] goodness of God that leads you to
[1:05:21] repentance pricked in their heart they
[1:05:29] became concerned about what they heard
[1:05:37] well I don't remember being concerned
[1:05:40] brother Dale oh yes III just I just
[1:05:45] accepted Jesus cry how can you accept
[1:05:47] Jesus Christ if you don't know who he is
[1:05:49] now come on I got it written down here
[1:05:55] in front of me so if you want it holler
[1:05:58] just remember you can't run around there
[1:06:00] with all of those things if it's not God
[1:06:03] calling you then your coming is great ok
[1:06:09] good makes you a good neighbor but don't
[1:06:11] make you a Christian if he's not calling
[1:06:16] you then you're not in line of salvation
[1:06:25] that's what I said no we work when he
[1:06:27] calls everybody brother Dale no we don't
[1:06:34] and just remember the odd group did he
[1:06:37] call I mean here was three thousand that
[1:06:44] was gathered there and he chose three
[1:06:51] thousand give a message and they
[1:06:57] accepted it what about it
[1:07:05] in other words what is the plan of
[1:07:08] salvation and what does it take to be
[1:07:14] saved
[1:07:22] number one it takes the fact of knowing
[1:07:24] whether God has called you now there's
[1:07:32] where the good part comes in if he's
[1:07:33] bragging about Jesus and telling how
[1:07:35] good he is and what he's done and not
[1:07:37] telling about how bad he is and how he
[1:07:40] hates you because you're doing this
[1:07:41] you're scaring I stood in Jamaica and
[1:07:49] watched after the I wound up most of you
[1:07:52] know the story I wound up four priests
[1:07:54] of her five or six days and nights and I
[1:07:57] just my voice was gone they would just
[1:08:00] just totally I couldn't even hardly have
[1:08:03] whisper and they said what it what do
[1:08:06] you want us to do I said I want you to
[1:08:08] put all the kids on the front row it's
[1:08:12] probably somewhere to 300 people maybe
[1:08:14] in that building I don't know I said
[1:08:18] bring all the kids up on the front row I
[1:08:20] want to talk to them I had an
[1:08:26] opportunity to jump on to them old folks
[1:08:29] about their tongues and their gifts and
[1:08:31] her things that they had scared him with
[1:08:38] and I started talking to him about the
[1:08:40] love of God and I told him he even told
[1:08:47] them flat-out I said your mamas and
[1:08:49] daddies gonna differ with me about this
[1:08:51] well I said I got an opportunity to
[1:08:53] speak to your children I'm gonna speak
[1:08:56] to you I said I gonna tell you you got
[1:08:59] to speak in tongues got to do this that
[1:09:00] any other
[1:09:00] I said that's their doctrines and ideas
[1:09:02] but I said all I want to do is talk to
[1:09:04] you about Jesus Christ I want you to see
[1:09:11] about this Jesus that I've been
[1:09:12] preaching about this one that I've been
[1:09:18] talking of doctrines and ideas all these
[1:09:20] five sermons or something before I won't
[1:09:24] talk to you
[1:09:26] don't want to scare you it won't work I
[1:09:30] won't talk to you about the love of God
[1:09:36] and a guy through preaching this order
[1:09:39] was full the children came to the altar
[1:09:46] sure next came the people and I had to
[1:09:51] back up mmm
[1:09:54] you understand what I mean because they
[1:09:58] jumped down and tried to get all of them
[1:09:59] speak in tongues and shouting and do her
[1:10:01] telling them come on now say it's that
[1:10:03] say it all those things I had to back up
[1:10:05] why because I knew I knew better no move
[1:10:09] any further but I had done what I had
[1:10:12] set out to do was to try to get those
[1:10:14] children to think about salvation about
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ and how they needed a
[1:10:25] savior I didn't go over there to stir up
[1:10:31] and create that's why they invited me is
[1:10:34] that invited if you know the story
[1:10:35] because a couple of brothers had went
[1:10:37] over there and they really tore the
[1:10:38] island up about the message and you got
[1:10:40] to believe this you got to do that and
[1:10:41] it's going to Rome or just run it real
[1:10:43] bad I'm then gonna call her names and
[1:10:49] the brothers I asked him when I got
[1:10:51] there asked the pastor I said I know
[1:10:55] what happened I said I know what the
[1:10:57] situation took place they know what
[1:11:01] happened here and what they're doing I
[1:11:02] said brother branham told us not to do
[1:11:04] that
[1:11:04] I said preaching the truth is preaching
[1:11:07] the truth but now that's deliberately
[1:11:09] beating on people because they don't
[1:11:11] believe what you believe it's not it and
[1:11:14] I said the Prophet told us not to do
[1:11:15] that I said then I'm here at your point
[1:11:18] you tell me how far to go and I'll honor
[1:11:22] your words this is what he said and
[1:11:26] that's what I done he said the morning
[1:11:28] services is my people take them to the
[1:11:32] greatest depth you could take her preach
[1:11:36] to them whatever is on your heart when
[1:11:39] he said it not said you gonna be
[1:11:41] witnessing 300 people from the island
[1:11:44] and they don't even know what in the
[1:11:46] world about a prophet or anything like
[1:11:48] that
[1:11:49] should be led to say what you say but
[1:11:53] just don't beat them about it and when I
[1:11:56] finished I was invited to come back see
[1:12:05] preaching Jesus Christ is not a bunch of
[1:12:07] rules and regulations and things to try
[1:12:09] to get you saved you can stop drinking
[1:12:11] stop smoking stop chewing stop doing all
[1:12:14] of those things and still die and go to
[1:12:16] hell but I just asked you a simple
[1:12:23] question to where we are what about it
[1:12:36] have you ever witnessed within your own
[1:12:40] life a conviction that came upon you -
[1:12:44] what are you were young or old or
[1:12:47] whatever you are and you say what I
[1:12:49] shouldn't do that there were no better
[1:13:00] than the drinking smoking gambling and
[1:13:02] stuff like ads you ought to know that
[1:13:03] that we're not trying to preach you quit
[1:13:05] all that and then you know you saved no
[1:13:07] you could ever better that and still be
[1:13:09] lost I'm just asking you a simple
[1:13:13] question has God ever dealt with you has
[1:13:22] he ever come down in the night or
[1:13:23] something talked to you you ever had a
[1:13:27] children when God would talk to you and
[1:13:31] say you need to do that you don't need
[1:13:35] to do this you don't need to be doing
[1:13:37] those thing you need to accept Jesus
[1:13:40] Christ as your Savior cause you see
[1:13:45] there's your first step it's a no
[1:13:50] repentance if not no repentance is
[1:13:54] should be an outward working of an
[1:13:57] inward point of something taking place
[1:14:02] that come out right it should be to the
[1:14:05] point of repentance you know now what
[1:14:13] was we do to be saved what about it you
[1:14:21] ever heard the word has it pricked you
[1:14:28] in your heart ain't talking about today
[1:14:31] I'm talking about in your life did you
[1:14:39] come to a knowledge of God because
[1:14:40] that's what Peter was bringing those
[1:14:42] people to he had to bring them to a
[1:14:45] knowledge of Jesus Christ you see why
[1:14:48] the truth is so important you see why
[1:14:51] that's so important this message and
[1:14:52] what we do now come on I know what God
[1:15:01] has done
[1:15:01] I got him laying here and I got the
[1:15:03] scripture where there was a time that
[1:15:04] God winked at ignorance is right yeah
[1:15:06] there was a time he winked it to
[1:15:08] ignorances of the fact that we believed
[1:15:10] in three gods and taught three gods and
[1:15:12] and Jesus was this and this was that and
[1:15:15] that was that and taught all of our
[1:15:16] doctrines and ideas and things like that
[1:15:18] and a lot of people come to altar under
[1:15:20] that but he says now he commands all men
[1:15:26] to repent what about it
[1:15:35] have you ever been pricked in your heart
[1:15:38] have you ever had a conviction to come
[1:15:41] upon you
[1:15:43] and be troubled just be troubled in your
[1:15:48] heart trouble didn't thinking about it
[1:15:55] that if he's done all of that for me
[1:15:59] what can I do for him right
[1:16:04] was that what Peter was explaining all
[1:16:07] that Jesus had went through and what had
[1:16:09] taken place and all along and when he
[1:16:12] did they become pricking me heart and
[1:16:13] they said men and brethren watching how
[1:16:14] much we do you brought us out now this
[1:16:19] far what should we do
[1:16:21] okay what should we do alright let's go
[1:16:35] to acts back where we were the number
[1:16:41] one quote we got down to verse 37 when
[1:16:53] he's got through explaining what had
[1:16:54] happened and what Jesus had taken place
[1:16:56] and how he died and how they had even
[1:16:58] crucified him when they heard this they
[1:17:01] were pricked in their heart and said
[1:17:03] unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles
[1:17:04] men and brethren what shall we do well
[1:17:10] you believe run-around was a prophet you
[1:17:12] can shout you can cry you can do now
[1:17:15] what did the Bible say the thing we
[1:17:20] don't like what is the one word we don't
[1:17:24] like
[1:17:33] I'm sorry right
[1:17:41] did that come out all right what's the
[1:17:43] very first thing in your life that you
[1:17:45] don't like to say I'm sorry I was wrong
[1:17:54] well you really dug this did you what
[1:17:58] should we do now here is the plan of
[1:18:01] salvation the first part brings you to
[1:18:08] what was said it's God calling you not
[1:18:11] you calling him it's God calling you to
[1:18:15] salvation all right now once you come to
[1:18:20] salvation bricked any heart what
[1:18:21] happened then said then Peter said unto
[1:18:24] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:18:32] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:33] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:18:35] the gift of the Holy Ghost I'll get to
[1:18:39] the other part in a minute because
[1:18:40] that's the worst misunderstood of all
[1:18:42] things is that little simple point this
[1:18:45] gets a simple point what it's saying
[1:18:46] what's the first thing to do in
[1:18:48] salvation repent repent everyone and be
[1:18:54] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:18:56] the remission of sin you shall receive
[1:18:57] the gift of the whole to go
[1:18:58] it's that scripture also promises under
[1:19:01] you and your children repent the Bible
[1:19:07] says that repent what did it repentance
[1:19:10] and the remission is to priest in the
[1:19:12] name of Jesus
[1:19:15] so they said now what can we do they
[1:19:20] were concerned he said repent
[1:19:27] what is repent mean Europe means to say
[1:19:32] I'm sorry or didn't but what does it
[1:19:34] really mean it means to turn around the
[1:19:38] mean stop what you do cause you going in
[1:19:41] the wrong direction
[1:19:43] right is that a simple understanding of
[1:19:47] the word repent
[1:19:52] it means to stop what you're doing
[1:19:55] turning around and go the other way
[1:20:03] repentance
[1:20:10] you remember what you know did people
[1:20:16] bring you up and talk to you yet you do
[1:20:18] or did they say to you now what you need
[1:20:20] to do and here's the basis of what the
[1:20:24] most most altar calls leads you to is
[1:20:26] you need to accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:20:30] Savior all right that's good but that's
[1:20:34] not starting it what
[1:20:41] that's not starting it you need to
[1:20:47] accept Jesus Christ as your Savior you
[1:20:50] don't you believe that life now that
[1:20:51] something goes in front of that we just
[1:20:55] read it what is it you need to repent
[1:21:02] then ask Jesus to come in no I need I
[1:21:08] know I prayed for Jesus to come in did
[1:21:11] you repent first
[1:21:23] maybe Jesus didn't come in go to
[1:21:25] remember the thing that we've always
[1:21:27] been told of what the Prophet says he
[1:21:30] said it's not whether you accept Jesus
[1:21:32] Christ
[1:21:34] it's whether he accepts you now if you
[1:21:38] don't repent he don't how to accept you
[1:21:44] are you with me what I rather dare I ask
[1:21:48] Jesus to come in I went to the altar I
[1:21:51] cried out I ask him to come into my
[1:21:53] heart and save me but did you ask him to
[1:21:56] forgive you of what you've been now
[1:22:00] coming wedding we're in the future home
[1:22:02] you know how to repair for what somebody
[1:22:04] else doing you know how to say God I'm
[1:22:06] sorry that Adam and Eve mess this thing
[1:22:08] up in the in the garden and I just got I
[1:22:11] can't how no per I've got problems but I
[1:22:13] can't help it now you're a liar come on
[1:22:25] we'll just come to the altar and accept
[1:22:28] Jesus Christ as your Savior come to the
[1:22:33] altar and repent of your sins then you
[1:22:35] have a right to ask God to forgive you
[1:22:36] then you have a right to ask him to come
[1:22:39] in then he's accepting you to come in
[1:22:42] but he doesn't have to give come in if
[1:22:45] you don't repent you're trying to get
[1:22:49] him to come in a dirty house at least
[1:22:53] we'll get to say a justification where
[1:22:56] the Prophet said it chops off your pie
[1:22:58] sins but you see one a lot of people
[1:23:05] never get nothing
[1:23:06] they're never been taught what to do I
[1:23:10] didn't write the book your prophets when
[1:23:12] it said it so you argued with him he
[1:23:15] said it's not whether or not you accept
[1:23:17] him that was a hard one that was a hard
[1:23:20] one for me cuz I know how that I saw God
[1:23:22] and not like that back in their
[1:23:24] denominations and things like that I saw
[1:23:26] God and when I come to find this message
[1:23:31] then the man that I claim to believe
[1:23:33] told me that you never saw God
[1:23:36] there was him seeking you then I
[1:23:40] realized hey this thing has been under
[1:23:43] way a long time he's been trying his
[1:23:46] best to slow me down long enough to get
[1:23:49] me straight and the first thing to do to
[1:23:52] get me straight is what I need to repent
[1:23:59] well no no you need to accept Jesus
[1:24:02] Christ if you're listening listen to
[1:24:05] what I'm saying you can't accept Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ that away you accept Jesus Christ
[1:24:09] on the basis that he asking him to
[1:24:11] forgive you and that he has paid the
[1:24:15] price who said it Peter
[1:24:22] Peter what can we do to be saved
[1:24:25] what you need to do is go get baptized
[1:24:26] oh we're going we're gonna win long time
[1:24:29] today but we're gonna get them good with
[1:24:31] on that now what you need to do is you
[1:24:34] need to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] you ain't even started what about all
[1:24:43] that 3,000 standing there said what must
[1:24:45] we do in Jesus looks at him in his head
[1:24:47] first thing he knew to need to repent
[1:24:55] now he never stood out there and said
[1:24:57] what you need to do is accept Jesus
[1:24:58] Christ he said you need to repent if you
[1:25:06] ever repented from your sins here's my
[1:25:11] old faithful statement right I'd rather
[1:25:13] go through life confessing all of my
[1:25:15] sins repent of all my sins and coming at
[1:25:17] the end of the road and find out the
[1:25:19] Lord doesn't put them under the blood
[1:25:20] then to not do it at all and wind up the
[1:25:22] end of the road and I have no hopes what
[1:25:26] about you brother Dale do you repent
[1:25:29] every day do you ask God to forgive you
[1:25:34] every day you must be a dirty guy I am
[1:25:42] thank you pray for me I don't have no
[1:25:45] problems I know what straighten what's
[1:25:47] right
[1:25:49] do you understand what I'm getting at
[1:25:51] what is the first thing they heard the
[1:25:52] message they were pricked in their heart
[1:25:55] why didn't Peter say all you got to do
[1:25:57] is believe what he done they already
[1:26:00] believe what he done they said they did
[1:26:02] by the fact of them said what can we do
[1:26:09] well you go join the church you believe
[1:26:11] God you do this you do that you you
[1:26:13] accept this you accept that no first
[1:26:18] thing do is repent now come on children
[1:26:29] young kids and things come on dolls
[1:26:32] let's listen but you know people don't
[1:26:37] teach you you need to repent this is not
[1:26:39] the age of repentance right this is not
[1:26:45] the age of repentance nobody wants to
[1:26:47] repent me you whoever do we want to
[1:26:56] repent no we're like the guy was it said
[1:27:07] what said is why said well you ain't
[1:27:09] told me in 20 years you love me said I
[1:27:11] told you today I married you I loved you
[1:27:13] and I ain't changed my mind
[1:27:18] well God knows 20 years ago I went to
[1:27:21] Dollar and accepted him as my savior
[1:27:23] now here's what and you can't tell me I
[1:27:26] ain't saved because I was dire well
[1:27:32] where are you now write repentance and
[1:27:42] remission of sins is in the name of
[1:27:43] Jesus Christ told you gonna make you
[1:27:48] simple as again first to realize God
[1:27:53] called you
[1:27:59] come on folks you know yourself yours
[1:28:02] enjoying the world use in right he's
[1:28:13] enjoying the what early within and you
[1:28:16] certainly didn't want to repent doing
[1:28:18] that or stop it you want to keep on
[1:28:20] doing it but sup didn't come over you

[1:28:51] it
[1:29:02] accepting Jesus Christ as my savior come
[1:29:05] on musicians I've accepted Jesus Christ
[1:29:09] as my savior what else can I do what did
[1:29:13] brother Branham say on that he said
[1:29:16] that's a good Baptist point or what else
[1:29:19] can I do but he said they'll say even
[1:29:21] look at Abraham and he you know but
[1:29:26] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:29:27] unto him for righteousness you know what
[1:29:30] happened in Abraham received a sign of
[1:29:33] circumcision the proving his repentance
[1:29:36] was genuine I prayed I've done praise
[1:29:49] God
[1:29:53] so we're supposed to be asking Peter in
[1:29:56] him who had it received it
[1:29:59] Peter how did you get this well I spent
[1:30:03] threatened I've years with the Lord
[1:30:04] learning the word known Peter how did
[1:30:07] you get to hold a girl
[1:30:14] then I first had to realize God was
[1:30:17] calling me you remember that at least
[1:30:22] realizing something was calling you
[1:30:24] something was dealing with you right and
[1:30:29] then you said well Lord I'm sorry I
[1:30:32] repented the baptism follows after that
[1:30:38] but it's not to sign of salvation well
[1:30:43] yet there's a big portion of people of
[1:30:45] this world leaving water baptism under
[1:30:47] regeneration one form or another and I
