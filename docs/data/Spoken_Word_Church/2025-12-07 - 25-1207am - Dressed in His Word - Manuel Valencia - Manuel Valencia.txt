TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Sunday school study the there was um the Lord changed the topic and I I just found out last night that uh this morning that there's uh the children had done a little work downstairs and it's precisely the the title of the topic. I just think it's very special you know it's encouraging to know praise the Lord. Let me get the set up. Number two. Yeah. The title today of the Bible study will be dressed in his word. I think it's such a special uh time in this age, right? The Lord has given us eyesap to see and the privilege to be uh clothed and dressed on his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the brothers get uh they set up, we we'll pray. We'll bow our heads where we are sitting. Heavenly Father, we're delighted to be here in your presence today. We're so thankful that we can have the confidence that your word has the power, Father, to to equip us, to dress us, to give us strength, to do so many things. But today, we'll we'll ask you that you open up, Father, the revelation of how your Bible is uh is the dressing, Father, of your church and of your little bride. And we're so grateful, Father, this day. And we're thankful, Father, that we can call upon you, that we can study your scriptures and and see all these things knitted throughout uh the entire Bible. And in the same way you knit the fabric, Father, of your word in the believer. So we ask today that you do a special miracle, Father, of uh of uh revealing this word to us and may you just anchor it in our souls. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ the Lord. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. So dressed in his word. So the first time we find somebody being dressed was in Genesis and that is in Genesis 3:201. I'll be going through a lot of scriptures really quickly, so won't have time to be flipping through them today, but I have them up here. So, and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living. Interesting here, right? That that they connects those two. Being a mother means there's a conception. And Adam also and and his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them, you know. So, the the first time it was leather, right? It was coats. It's an animal life. Of course, blood was shed. But um the purpose of being clothed is in general I put some notes here is it's to cover a shame or nakedness as we saw but it's also to cover from the weather from the elements and it protects from injuries right uh and mainly it's identify as who you are and what you believe and we'll find that brother Brandham touched up on uh on the topic of the policeman having the authority and he talked about the bride being reviewed. So I believe it matters what you wear of course externally but also we are as persons right we're always displaying also the spiritual clothing that we're clothed with right &gt;&gt; so that's what we'll see today so talk about natural clothing so the Bible makes distinctions there are clothes of services right the priest so to do service in the holy place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in in the priest's office so then we see that God provided the lambs. It says the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are for the price of the field. So we find that the king's daughter is all glorious within. Her clothing is of raw gold is written in here. And we'll find um the different materials that we find for clothing. We see we see linen. We see different materials like sackloth. We see the Bible talk about silk and scarlet and purple and blue and different either types or colors all signifying something. But you know it is important to be covered. This Bible verse stuck to me when I read it um myself uh just reading through the Bible is one of those Bible verses where you never heard it before but you read it yourself. Nemiah 4:23 um so neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes. So they were consecrating and it says saving meaning except that everyone put off them off for washing. So this is a time of consecration that was happening. Of course you know Nemiah was a building of of um building up again. So the um the concept here is that we are supposed to be clothed. &gt;&gt; I think that when when we go up and about, when we go, wherever we go, whatever we do, we we are supposed to be reflecting, displaying something, right? Physically, of course, but I I believe spiritually of course uh and and we should not be caught without our clothes off. Of course, the Bible talks a lot about, you know, protecting of uh of our nakedness and and of shame. And I believe that's what this word does and that's what this message came to do for us. And and here we find in Psalm 109 it says, "Let my adversaries be clothed with shame and let them cover themselves with their own confusion so at the mantle of confusion as with the mantle." See, we find in Proverbs 31 um the the virtuous woman. So we find where it says, "She maketh herself coverings of tapestry. Her clothing is silk and purple." I just always loved, you know, the Proverbs 31, the the uh virtuous woman. And I've always could visualize that, right? It's a woman that um it's laboring to ensure that her and her family is is clothed, right? And that it's covered and that it's uh ready for the in this case for the element, for the winter. So, I think this Bible uh this God's word, this message has closed us and and it and it has a utility behind it. It is not just a display. It is a display, but it also has it's an empower and an authority that follows that. It's it's um it's in I wish we could see in the unseen, right? You know, I know we know Solomon spoke about um the the grass and the and the lay leaves and the flowers being covered and and being uh being clothed uh and that not even Solomon was clothed in in such a glory. And it says and then in other places it says if God cares about the grass and talking about you know the feeding the birds and all that how much more does he care of dressing the grass how much does he care about about you? So it is important it is important what we're dressed and clothe upon. In Mark 1 we see 16 and John was clothed with camel's hair and with the girdle of skin about his loins and he did eat locust and wild honey. So the Bible's very descriptive, right? Always describing what everybody had their own purpose. And it's interesting because then we find Jesus was clothed with with linen, right? So see, it all has its place. It all has his uh it's uh its purpose. So Elijah second uh Kings, we find out that um Eli Elijah, he was going up. He said, "Oh, you asked for a hard thing." When he wanted a double portion, right? So see that mantle represented a double portion because that's what he asked for. And he said, "If you see me if you see me going up, then then you'll you will, right?" Uh but then verse 12, it says, "And Elisha saw it. He saw the he saw him going up and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof, and he saw him no more." And he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces and took up also the mantle of Elijah and that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan to continue the work right in the ministry. I think it's beautiful that we have a mantle of grace this time. We have clothes of righteousness. So talking about spiritual clothing now and I'll make this a short Sunday school teaching because I know we got an event later today. So Isaiah 61:10, it says, "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord. My soul shall be joyful in my God." Scriptures we read last Sunday because we were talking about joy. But it's also fitting here because it says, "For he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation." &gt;&gt; Amen. He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom deckth himself with ornaments. All this has done is is picture a bride who decking himself with ornaments and as a bride adornneth herself with her jewels. I'm thankful that we've read you know that the bride has made herself ready and uh was meditating a lot about the 10 virgins. It's not written in the Bible as so, but we do know that uh the cry was at midnight and we do know that um that the others didn't make it in time, right? And they went to sleep. And usually people go to sleep, they some of us put our pajamas on. And I just think it's important, you know, that it's the vigilance, you know, the the fact that they were they had their lives, they had they were their oil was there and that they were uh ready and expectantly waiting. May the Lord find us that way here. So in Job 29 it says it it was a parable. That's the first verse how it speaks about how Job spoke a parable. So all this was in a parable. But then he says, "I put on righteousness and it clothed me. My judgments was as a robe and a diadem." See a lot of parallels here about robes and raignments and coverings and and being clothed and being dressed. Here's an example in Galatians 3:27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. In a lot of other translations, here's an example. One, it says have clothed yourself with Christ. So put on, right? It's something you put on as a display, as a something you you carry with you. In 2 Chronicles 6:41, it says, "Now therefore arise, O Lord, into thy resting place. Thou in the ark of thy strength, let thy priest, O Lord, be clothed with salvation, and let the saints rejoice in goodness. Amen. So in first Peter, it says, "Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yep. All of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility." See, it's it's the attributes of of God's word and display. I can only imagine, right, if you actually could see in the other dimension, right? Because clothing, what we have external is a representation of the spiritual is the different ornaments, the different jewels and what they represent and the different aspects of of the of of God's spiritual dimension, right? Where we can just see somebody being clothed in righteousness and humility and having a robe. So it actually makes distinctions. There's clothes, there's dress, there's rains, there's garments, there is actual there's different layers. Sometimes people wear a mantle, sometimes they wear a scarf. And it's just beautiful how it's typifying. But if you could see that in the other dimension, you probably just see and we'll see how Jesus when he was went into Mount Transfiguration, right? His um he he was wearing natural clothes, but all of a sudden, I believe their eyes were open, right? Because they say they saw they saw um they saw into the other dimension, right? They saw the others coming in and joining and they saw Jesus uh it began by his countenance being transfigured and being uh shining and then he says that his linen was white as as snow as is glistening. Amen. So it clothe humility for God raises resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble again. And so speaking here about being dressed in his word in Revelations 1:3 says, "And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with the golden griddle girdles." And here an interesting fact I found that in the message in 54, brother Man was speaking on uh the seven church ages. That was the title of the message. We know it's back in 54 I believe it was. Um but one of the interesting parts is that he typified the bride on here. He's just mentioning here that you know speaking about about the paths and the different things and he actually outlined every single one of these because it says it does say like unto the son of man. And um it's a it's it's an interesting parallel there that I found. But in here it says he that overcomemeth the same shall be clothed with white gar raignments and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life. speaking to different groups here. But I will confess his name before my father and before his angels. In in Luke, we see that but the father saith to his servants, bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hands and shoes on his feet. Just thinking about the elements of um how God made provisions, right? how how um the children of Israel talked about how their clothes did not wax old and their feet did not um and their shoes did not um did did not stop functioning. Anyway, I forgot how I read it, but um I just think it's beautiful how I grew up from a generation where my father um they had no shoes. They literally walked around without shoes. And so my father's uh father, my grandfather being a shoe maker, as I mentioned before, you'll see the whole school class with nobody had shoes on except my dad. Yeah. It was made out of just leather and then little nails that you put like on a little edge. And then what they would get is old tire rods from just the road. They would cut those out. That's what they would be the that would be the sole of your feet, of your shoe. And I just think it's special, you know, that God made provision for for us. And here it's it's the prodigal son. And that's all of us, right? The Lord puts on his best robe on us. You know, uh when I didn't put on the notes here, um but uh when Jesus uh it was at the cross, it talked about how they rent his clothes. And in one place it says they rented in four pieces and how they actually put on another kingly royal clo on him and mocked them, you know, saying, "Hey, king of the Jews." and they actually kneel down. Makes me wonder, you know, if they were really fulfilling a prophecy even though they were mocking, right? But they were he he was being clothed even in his cross. Clothing matters. What we're clothed about and what we hear about uh it does matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Isaiah 61 it says to appoint unto them that mourn in signs. So the bride to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning and the garments of praise. I love that song, right? Put on the garments of praise. It says for the spirit of heaviness like against the spirit of heaviness, right? And I just think it's amazing that um even when we're praising, we're displaying garments. We're displaying um our garments of praise unto him that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified. Amen. So we find here second Corinthians it says for this we groan earnestly desire to be clothed &gt;&gt; upon with our house which is uh from heaven. For if so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. &gt;&gt; For we that are in the in this tabernacle do grown, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life. Amen. So this life that we walk, this blessed message that we live, this blessed Bible, it's preparing a bride and it's a type, right? It's clothing her and I think if you could see it and remember we we'll show the Bible the message quote here where brother Brandon was saw a bride in review and it actually says that it uh it brought joy to his heart. In one place it says that that will be my crowning of my ministry is is to take the the word the clothes of the word and to be able to dress the bride and prepare her for this message. Let us not take for granted that we've been um that these things have been revealed to us. Awake, awake, put on thy strength, oh Zion, oh bride. Put on thy beautiful garments, oh Jerusalem, the holy city. For henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. What a beautiful promise, right? I was going to teach today on um the progression of sin. So I think we're having it easy today. So bear with me as I as I developed this this uh title. Um, for some reason late last night, um, I had almost all the way done, but I think that's for another time because it it just closed up on me. So, you're having it easy this morning, huh? Going to be easy on us. All right. Zechariah 3. Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood therefore before the angel. And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away thy filthy garments from him. See, it matters. And this is Joshua talking about, this is Zachchariah. So this is Joshua talking about a priest Joshua named Joshua. And unto him he said, "Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee." So it always goes with it, right? There's always a a letting go of an old garment to get the new one, and I will clothe thee with the change of raignment. And in Matthew 22, um it says 11 through 12. And when the king came in to see the guests, so this is the wedding, right? He saw there a man which had not a wedding garment. See, and he said unto him, friend, how cometh thou in hither not having a wedding garment? &gt;&gt; You must have that wedding garment. &gt;&gt; I believe it's been said that uh in that tradition that was your invitation is you your wedding garment that that was your it was provided for the guests and that's what you would wear for the wedding. And he was speechless. He knew like you could see the culture here. He could have just said, "Oh, what's wrong?" You know, what's wrong about my jeans? But he he knew. Revelation 16:15, "Behold, I come as a thief. Bless blessed is he that watchth and keepeth his garments." We need it. We need our garments lest we walk naked and they see his shame. And here in Galatians 3:18, it says, "I counsel thee to buy of me, not just gold tried in the fire." But then it says, "Gold the fire that thou mayest be rich." And so that means you also have to buy white rain that thou mayest be clothed and that thy shame thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with Isaps that thou mayest see. See his message came to give us Isa but again came to give us gold tried in the fire but also came gave us a white raignment by of me. So just briefly going to go over God's raignments in Psalm it says the Lord reignth he is clothed with majesty the Lord is clothed with strength. See see the virtues here wherewith he had ged himself the world also is established that it cannot be moved. Matthew says he went to Pilate and be begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded this is um Joseph of Joseph the the one that gave him his tomb. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in clean clothes. Never seen it that way. His body needed to be wrapped and it was wrapped in clean clothes. You can imagine the condition of the body. And to me, it's interesting that he came wrapped and he left wrapped. In Luke 2:12, beautiful connection here. It says, "And this shall be a sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloth lying in a manger." I think it's beautiful. Must have been linen. I wish I wish I could have I kept on looking to see if I if it was linen, but you know the day it must have been linen. But I know in the earlier scriptures it did say that he was wrapped in clean clean cloth. It says clean linen cloth. And in Mark five we see for she said if I may touch by the by but by his clothes I will be whole. You know the his uh the hem of his garment. In Revelation 10, I'll wrap it up here a couple minutes. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. What kind of clothing is that? Look how beautiful that is. A mighty angel. Revelations 10:1. And a rainbow was upon his head. And his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillar of fire. He's just taking care of the clothes, the feet. It's just beautiful. It's a beautiful type. I think if we could see into other dimension, we'd be surprised. you know what a Christian looks like when they're walking in the attributes of God. Psalm 104:2, "Who coverth thyself with light as a with a garment." So, you can see you would see somebody who's uh covered with light when they're walking around as if it was a garment. Probably has a structure to it. Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain this case? I think it might be talking about um the Lord. Matthew 17 and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raignment was white as the light and again same same uh his countenance was like lightning and his reignment white as snow. Amen. The policeman so the uniform right it represented not just power but authority right it says it takes authority. So and the author and the church has an authority from Jesus Christ. Just a couple more quotes here. In my name, they shall cast out devils, speak with new tongues. If they take up serpents or deadly things, it it'll not harm them. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover. That's his given authority. Now, what if the same little policeman is afraid to raise his hand and step out in that traffic? He better take off that uniform, present the badge back because he'll never make a policeman. Neither will he ever make a believer as long as we're afraid to exercise the authority that's been given us by Jesus Christ. And that authority was represented with the uniform with the policeman uniform. We have victory. We don't have to have any we don't have to fight for victory. We already have victory. He conquered it for us. Not us. He conquered it for us. We are not the mighty conqueror. He is the mighty conqueror. Amen. And here he find out it just typifying that I'll read what's highlighted here and then it says one of these days with his beautiful bride all clothed and made herself ready though he has scars in his hands nailed prince he will stand as a king the king of kings and the lord of lords I want to see that someday and here's the bride in review there came up that little bride lovely in the vision And I not think about this and not think about it just sitting here watching outside and there come the bride. I heard a voice by the side of me saying here is a preview of the bride and she came by. I noticed her the way she was very lovely, pretty young. She was walking just as as just a step as she could. Not a march, just in the stride of a woman. how they walk gracefully ladylike. That's the way she was walking coming up on my left side and she went out of my side. Just a few more here. And um and in here it says, "And I've not shun to declare to you the whole gospel of Jesus Christ and my heart's desire to meet the church which he died for clothed in righteousness." And then it says of his own blood, dressed in his word and the righteousness of his word. for his word can never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that bride that came in review again, look what it says here. Now as she passed by, the whole back part had no covering at all. Then as she passed by, I felt faint and sickly. Then he said the voice, "The bride will come into preview again." And there the bride came behind her, the very same looking bride that passed at the beginning. He had seen her before in the vision. Then my heart jumped for joy. See, he saw her to know that there will be a bride. He's seen her. He's seen you in the preview. And she will be made of the same thing and clothed in the same thing. That the one as the one that was at the beginning, she is to be called and I know that is truth. If the truth is if it isn't true then every vision look how important he this is to him every vision that I've had in the back has been wrong meaning previously and anyone knows that no one thing has ever told us but what was truth it come to pass just and can you see then the filthiness of the modern church calling herself a church here's the last one I hope he will crown my ministry of of of this of letting me take the clothes of the word, the revealed word. He's seen her, so he know what he looked like. And dress his bride in the clothe of the word for his righteousness. And I hope he will crown me. Let me stand on that day. Say, behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
