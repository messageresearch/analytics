place 50 52 years ago but it's good to see people still standing for the word of God Amen such an honor and a privilege to be here tonight thank brother Wade for amen I wasn't supposed to be here this is really not my time brother Jason Jackson was supposed to be here and and then I guess he's something happened and it's it's fell on me so amen we're so good to be brother Cadence sir good to see you you didn't come all the way over here just for this service did you you did man we certainly appreciate the Lord tonight if you have your Bibles let's open together to Hebrews chapter 12. you don't mind if I take his coat off it's hard to Hebrews chapter 12. I like to read two verses I'll just read two verses Hebrews 12 1 verse 1 and verse 2. Apostle Paul says wherefore seeing we are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen just bow your heads just a moment if you would father we thank you tonight Lord for the great privilege that you give us to be assembled in your divine presence Lord in the wonderful songs that we have just sang Lord just encouraged our hearts oh God and Lord we know that your Prophet taught us this is the most important part of any service is what we do with the word of God we pray tonight father that you'd come and that you'd anoint the word to every heart we know Lord that your word is Anointed we pray that it'll come down and speak to every heart to every life may you bless both the speaker and the here tonight Lord we've opened the Bible but we understand that any man can open the Bible but oh God it takes the Holy Spirit to make it live we pray tonight that you'd come father we just pray that you'd help us to get out the way may you speak to every life may you meet every need that's represented among us we pray now and the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everyone says amen God bless you you may be seated I won't spend a lot of time introducing myself but I am Luke Gibson which that really don't matter I'm a married man I got seven kids and this year I have 10 grandkids enough said amen I want to speak tonight if I could for a few moments on a subject that's been dear to me over the last few years I preached in several places but when brother Wade called me the other day just a little thought come on my heart and you sometimes you just better to obey the Lord I'd like to take the subject tonight let us run very simple let us run now I'm a Believer tonight that this Bible is our absolute when we live in a world like we live in tonight we realize we live in a time that people don't want an absolute right but I believe that this Bible right here is God's infallible word and God did give us an absolute and his word is our absolute men change time changes churches change preachers change but God's word never changes it's forever settled and will always remain the word of God I want to bring this up but I had a fella that's been texting me and he's been carrying on conversations with me and a lot that he says sounds good and I said brother out of the greatest respect I could have for you what you say sounds good but I can't find it in the word and I said we live in a time that people chase after a lot of sensation a lot of things and something that might tickle their ears I said but I'm far beyond that now I said what we say has got to come out of the Bible I believe when God sent us a prophet and I do believe he sent one and I believe this prophets Vindicated by almighty God but I even believe brother Brown's message has got to come back to the Bible I believe it does come back to the Bible I don't believe God sent us a prophet to take us away from the word he said it's the prophet to bring us back to the word of God I heard this message when I was 18 years old and the Pentecostal won this Apostolic Church an attempt meeting in Tipton Georgia I'm 52 years old tonight almost 53 and from my congregation I'll be 53 on the 25th so don't forget that I've been listening this prophet and I got to be honest with you brother Wade I've never found nowhere on this message contrary to the scriptures not getting to something tonight that might offend some people but I do believe that our Prophet had a progressive understanding amen amen I believe he groaned in Christ just like we grow in Christ he didn't come out of his mother's womb with a full understanding of who God was but he growed in grace and the knowledge of God now I believe if he had to do that we got to do the same tonight but you know I was thinking of that for a little bit on Paul talking about let us run and when I look at the scriptures on you know you you was a sports man I was a sports man and secretly I I don't tell it but I still sort of am just a little and when I read the Bible I'm shocked at how much natural things typed out spiritual things the Apostle Paul was one of the greatest at taking metaphors and acknowledges and just natural things of life and showing the spiritual activity of the work of God in a man's life brother Bannon was the same way took a lot of natural things to express things over in the spiritual realm because the natural types the spiritual matter of fact brother banham taught us that God's first Bible before we ever had this written word he could look at nature and see God God's in nature he's in his word and he's also in his people but one of the things that the Apostle Paul used was the human body what you think about this man he used the human body and over in Corinthians he talks about the human body and he would type it with the spiritual body of Christ he would say things like this can the hand say the foot I have no need of thee and what he should be taking is one body that all has to function together and one part of the body can't say to another part of the body I don't have no use of you I don't know about you but I love my feet and after this service I'm gonna love my hands and I'm certainly gonna love my mouth and Saul's head down my love my belly I like this human body that's right but this human body is a type of the spiritual body of Christ and we find out that Paul and I just want to lay this little foundation for a minute lays out the body and how it functions and Compares it to the spiritual position of every believer that's in Christ and so when he talks about it he begins to show a certain positions of the body and each position that he would talk about represents something that God that he said this way the spiritual activity of the holy ghost in a man's life I tell you that God is still at work in his people I don't care how far this thing goes God's gonna have somebody on Earth that's going to represent him and he's going to have somebody on there that he still works through he ain't right off out there somewhere he's right here with us tonight and so he talks about the position of our body now a minute ago y'all were standing right right now I'm standing I was sitting and y'all was standing now I got to stand over the next few moments and you've got to sit and we outstanding and then we have sitting and two different positions but both of those positions represent something in the spiritual body of Christ let me just go on just for a minute no matter what action our body is operating in even a change of natural possession it's expressing something about our spiritual position now let me show you the body I'm referring to because when I refer the spiritual body I'm not necessarily talking about this there's a spiritual body that every man and woman in here is a part of and that spiritual body is called the spiritual body of Christ so whatever he's doing we're doing whatever his action is there is our actions are here let me show you what happens when Jesus dies and raise as a gift he died for our sins he raised right justification thank God we still have a Risen Lord tonight you don't have to die no more he died once for sin that's it he live it now unto God I and you I represented in what his body did but I said when he went to Calgary we went with him when he died we died when he was buried we were buried and when he ascended we ascended with him now watch this and we sat together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but guess what Ephesians chapter one I'm hurrying now blessed be the god father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places notice this now in Christ Jesus now there could be heavily places here tonight and there is but they don't mean anything to you if you ain't in Christ now listen brother bear said when he'll sin he goes further and he tells us now watch that that Heavenly place is your position in Christ did he reach he comes he features two unless what it says and he raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ now that don't mean when this physical body every time you want to get in Christ you have to go sit down that's talking about what he did right the prophet said when he ascended on high he sat down and him setting down was a sign that the work was finished let me say it tonight if you're identified with him the work for your salvation is completed you don't have to do nothing Christ already did it and we sit with him so his position it speaks something about our position in Christ now let's see closely our location can change and even the people that when Paul is writing Ephesians 1 he don't say to the Saints who are in Lula he don't say to the Saints who are in Townville he says to the saints that are in Ephesus so the location that he's writing us to it's the Believers that are in Ephesus but then he says after the faithful in Christ Jesus so it wouldn't matter tonight if I read this in Lula if it's to those that's in Christ Jesus I don't have to be in their location as long as I'm in their position [Applause] come on church after 2 000 years you and I are in the same position that the church was 2 000 years ago we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now watch I gotta go on now it's not necessary that we be in the same location to those to whom the letter was written to right a few years ago I went with brother George Smith me and a few brothers from the church and we went to Israel we went to the upper room and Benny Hinn had a crowd there and they were all in the upper room supposed to be in the physical location at the early church got the Holy Ghost there's no scripture that tells me physically I have to be in the same location I just got to meet the same conditions and when I meet the same conditions God will baptize me in the same position that that early church was in now watch what I'm saying because even though the letter was not written to us but it's written to everyone who's in that same position setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now watch Ephesus what's their location in Christ what's their position now tonight your location is but your position is in Christ tonight my location is going to change I'm going back to Westminster tomorrow I'll be in Townville but you know the same position I'm in right now I'll be in that tomorrow when I'm standing In a Pulpit it's in Christ some of you may go back to Paul Mercer hear Lula and tomorrow you'll come back here when you leave here and go home your position hasn't changed your location changes but never your possession now let me tell you this your position your location can never change your position but one day our position is going to change our location [Applause] one over here one over there because no matter where we're at in the world if we're in Christ we're in the same position at that position one day is going to change our location can you say praise the Lord that's why I don't tell people they got to go to a certain Church just get in Christ you get in Christ he'll lead you where to go to church this might not be popular but I believe if you're in Christ you'll go to church I said the other night holy ghost fill people up to go to church your position pushes you to that now listen so like Paul the Apostle look at him where'd he spend when he wrote these letters you realize that man he wasn't brother Wade like you and I maybe sitting in the air conditioned office I told somebody that I said God couldn't have called me to be the mess of the age I couldn't have been a message I wasn't nature that way I'll tell you now I'm not going to no cave at three o'clock in the morning waiting on an angel or whatever if he dance with me it's gonna be in my bedroom or the Holiday Inn I'm just not cut out that way but God had to cut his man out the way he wanted him to brother Madam talks about that cave going on in the candle they say they found it I'm not saying they haven't but I'm saying when I've seen them squeezing through them two rocks and get down now I said I'm glad he was the messenger because I ain't going there God Moses man the way he wants him the Apostle Paul when he went to where his office was where a lot of these letters were inspired from was down in the jailhouse now I've spent one night in jail and I wasn't called of God to go to the jails judge told me he said preacher maybe this will Lord I said no sir I ain't coming to save him you let him out then we'll get them saved I said I'm not I'm not no jail bird unless I had to do it for the cause of Christ but let me just tell you this Paul when he was down in Rome in a prison cell and he wrote his letters he didn't say hi Paul a prisoner of Rome his location was in the jail but his position was in Christ [Applause] a prisoner of Jesus Christ he was identified with his possession to notice he never one time in the Bible ever called himself Apostle Paul it was Paul the Apostle because back in that day a title a name in front of your name was a title but after your name was a position hey he was an apostle by possession he was an apostle by predestination nobody laid hands on him to make him an apostle he was called of God from his mother's womb to be an apostle man just like you're called to be a believer you're called to be a Christian or an evangelist or this or that every man in his got a position in Christ nobody can give that oh I'm gonna say it nobody can give it to you nobody can take it from you that's predestinated by almighty God [Applause] and the reason some people ain't happy with it that's because you always comparing yourself to somebody else God made one you and nobody can be you just be who God Made You listen position can never change let me tell you why because possession is eternal security now I know what the prophet of God said I've been around long enough to know that people run out on both extremes and brother M taught us both extremes the prophet was so wonderful the way he had balanced things up for us I mean you've been this mess long enough no sometimes you get pushed over this side and if you're not careful and you get influenced by too many people that push you away over here and then then in fact this crowd's pulling on you especially when you're a young preacher they pull you on this side and after a while God really gets a hold of you you appreciate all of them but you come right back to the middle of the road and that's where God wants us that's where we ought to be let everything washed up or let's stay right in the middle of this message there's people that holding what is word word no spirit that is a bunch of one Spirit screaming holiday ain't got no words I believe we can have both of them we can have the word anointing people under the spirit amen and that's what you see the results hey your position will go to work then you believe that same man now this evening we come and this is really the theme just first just for a few moments I can't preach too long I got to preach tomorrow I'm not 20 years old no more I done said the other night I've done crept over the top of the hill there this is to those listen that are in Christ you're in Christ because you're sitting in this church now I'm believing you are but I'm just telling you people come to church they hate in Christ but I've been quoted over and over and over and over by one spirit that's right not the one Doctrine not but one theology not but somebody's pet teaching by one Holy Ghost baptism that's how we get into Christ that's what should be taught to every young person you've got to be born again listen now when we speak just for a minute for these metaphors because that's what they are they're metaphors just natural things to teach us something about the spiritual so when he talks about the body and certain activities of it or possessions of it speaking of something over in the spiritual room let me give you an example he says number one I talked about it we sit in Heavenly places every man that's here tonight I don't care nothing wrong with it but I don't care if you get a goosebump down your back that's nothing to do with your position that means you might have emotion emotions is wonderful I'm an emotional but I love emotions I got seven kids I'm emotional I get a lot of grandkids around my house and they get on my nerves and I get emotional I said it's time for y'all to go home I said now before you do come in the kitchen I want to give you some chocolate and candy and ice cream and then go home and you torment them the way they tormented me amen I believe in Emotion but I never never judge the word of God by my emotions as a matter of fact I don't even judge the word of God by my experiences I judge my experiences by the word of God by the way there's been a lot of times I had some really good thoughts go through my mind glory to God and yet the best thing well that ain't what he said I felt emotion about it people they don't like this but if it's conjure the words lay it down on how emotional makes you I believe in Emotion don't get me wrong but I believe your experiences and all your emotions you've got to take them back to the word of God now look in Heavenly places your position now that you notice all he also told us that we must walk in the light now to walk you got to get up you got to get out of your shedding possession and you got to walk at sitting and walking is two different positions and they express two different truths about the Holy Ghost working in your life then he not only taught us to walk he also taught us to stand Ephesians 6 this is all right of Ephesians he taught us to stand having done all therefore stand and I can show the same Lord Jesus that went to heaven and sat one day Stephen was being stoned and the heavens were opened and he didn't say I see the son of man sitting I see the Monster Man Standing and the promise said why was he standing he was standing up for his church that was under persecution different possession shedding walking standing all different but they all Express a spiritual truth about the body of Christ now tonight is on running and I know someone you'd rather sit than run I can look at you and tell that you've been sitting a whole lot more than you've been running even walking don't get mad at me now I'm just kidding you don't even like to stand that long not when you sat so long and you change your body structure you don't like to stand so long either this stuff hurts my feet I'm not saying that to be offensive I'm getting to a point for expressing something about a truth concerning the Holy Ghost working in your life says what is that the work's finished I don't like it but look brother I come out of a group that had Works before faith Works before Faith leads men to legalism and they think there's something they can do to make themselves acceptable God but let's say there's not one thing you can do it's already been done you just got a set in Christ relax if the work is already done if God's called you Satan can't take you you belong to Christ I know it's hard but you can't be lost no more than God can be lost your salvation is secure the work is finished he cried it out it is finished took his body and put it in the ground he his body went to the Grave says the real part of him went somewhere else but on Resurrection morning God didn't leave that body in a grave it didn't go back to the 16 elements God raised that body up it was the Redemptive body of Jehovah God and he raised Jesus up and he sets the night in the presence of God representing you and I [Applause] even told the brothers on the way to church I heard Brothers say the other day when you're in Christ and you pray and you pray through the blood it's the same as Jesus praying to the father Brother people could ever understand their position in Christ that when you pray to the blood it's the voice of Jesus praying to the father it's the same as him speaking you believe that now the work's finished so I didn't do it no you didn't do it but you are in the body that did it that's the key look do you realize how much condemnation I could wipe out of our churches by getting the people to put their eyes on the one that belongs on it don't belong on you don't belong to me your eyes belong on Christ and when you listen what I said the other day I said when I look at myself I don't know how I can be saved but when I look at him I don't know how I can be lost it's about him your mind's got to be on Christ he's the one that finished the work with the utmost respect and I'll come to that's more respect I have for our messenger and I believe in that I do I do but brother bam didn't die for my sins Christ died for our sins your eyes have got to be all priced listen walk not just sit now walk what does that really mean it means simply this progression don't you dare walk if he don't give you something to walk in you stay right where you're at no the Bible said walk in the light and if God don't open light stand right where you are just stand there and wait you try to force it in you'll find yourself out there in darkness somewhere stay with the light anybody ever heard of Brother Richard Blair did you ever know anybody ever know him brother Mike I knew him in Arkansas one of the finest men I knew walked in shoe leather we differed on some things but who cares he was still my brother he told me a testimony how he was in we were coming from the same groups he came out of the Wonders United Pentecostal church and he went down heard brother random in Hot Springs and and when he heard brother Branham he was there in the United Pentecostal Church he gave brother Branham a call later got a hold of Billy Paul and he said he said he said Billy would you ask brother Branham if I should come out of the United Pentecostal Church and his brother random said no said you just stay right there and brother Brandon began to talk to him and brother bam said Billy tell him that I saw an adulterous spirit on him and his wife and man brother Prophet God told you that tear you out of frame it tore him out of the frame went back to his wife they sat down they commune went back and forth nothing never done nothing he called brother man back up so brother banham i absolute brother Billy Paulson brother Billy Paul tells this said we've discussed and said nothing no infidelity nothing but I said ask him what church he belongs to he said I belong to the United Pentecost church he said that's that adultered spirit I saw brother my next statement would be brother Ben should I get out of there that's what he asked you know about Adam said no my brother stay right there you talk about confusion coming in he said the third time he went down to Jeffersonville her brother random preach I think this day this scripture is fulfilled got back home called brother Billy Paul said ask Daddy your daddy if I should come out the United Pentecostal church now and brother brother bam said tell him stay right there but brother that morning he said to brother Billy but tell him I heard him say Sunday come out of her brother bear said oh that's different then if you heard me say come out come out [Applause] walk in this life yes sir I'm gonna talk about that just a minute because I've got that's what I tell my brother here before service tell brother wait I said brother Wade I got a lot of Pentecostal Brothers and one in particular we're talking about before service and I have he doesn't see what I see they don't even see the message he ain't gonna condemn his brother bam for being a prophet but he's going to see his message don't don't get mad I had him preach for me he gonna hurt me all right if I've taught my people correctly he ain't gonna hurt my people I want him to see what this message has produced he came and preached for us and he told me he said look I I'll admit to you he said that's what he said the Pentecostals don't want the word they want my gift I said I know my brother I know I said but he said I've never seen a crowd like this that loves the word I said brother just give us the word so we got to talk and I went down to Norristown Georgia one time heard him sitting in this little camper there and I walked in his tears rolling down his face I said brother what's wrong he said brother Luke these people don't want the word I said I almost called his name I said brother that's what I've been telling you for a long time but I know a group that wants it amen has he come out no he can't come out cause I tell him hey he can only come when God calls him look I don't condemn the brother he's my brother I love him and I pray to God he's somewhere I look I don't care if God calls him on his deathbed give him as much grace on his deathbed that you gave me at 18 years old I'm not standing with this Grace I want God to give it to everybody he was in the hospital the other day who does his family call they call me they know I love that man they know that man loves me but he don't see the message but does that mean I got to disrespect him no I pray for him God opened his eyes because I know if God ever has opened his eyes there'll be something to happen to him that happened all to you you'll hear a voice that says come out of her my people be your separate Chef the Lord and your body will do what that voice tells you to do [Applause] so we we walk means progression I know people get mad at it I don't care what I can take the by the very messy itself and prove to you that brother random walked in late but that's things he preach after still I show you but he didn't preach that same thing before the seals but he can only preach on the line he had but when look it's like brother Benham what was brother Benham he wasn't even he didn't even have the light when he first started out of some of y'all had yeah right some of y'all were Pentecostal Pentecostals further than the Baptist right right you know the pen you know what a Baptist is the Baptist is still not going to start the title before that little blood brings for that missionary age John Smith and those men that's where brother Ben came to Christ at but when God when he went down that little Pentecostal meeting yeah right remember yes God started dealing with him that Pentecostal church I've always wondered why did God why did he just bypass he couldn't he had to travel with a life went at that time the light was in the shock the ship protected the son of man Ministry and its empathy called an evil shock it was a good shock he said but it served its time [Music] look if God would have took brother banham and brought him from that tassel straight into the seed he would have broken the continent of his own word cause a seed don't come out the tussle the seed comes out of the shock so he had to bring brother Ben to the Pentecostal age God was so serious about that brother I'm walking that light that he even took his wife and his baby right you should have never let your mother-in-law talk against my people you know who God's people was where the light was it was in that Pentecostal age there's gonna be Pentecostal people's one by the way the grave coming up in that Resurrection they're going to be your brothers and sisters in Christ yes sir I got old grandma I know she sealed in under that Pentecostal age come to my church but never could truly see what we preach I believe she sealed in under that Pentecostal age she walked in the light that God revealed to her so what happened God brings us property That Shook age they protect him yep that as his ministry began to grow from the first pool second pool now this very same problem that they love to hear him call people's names and prophesy and tell this and tell that and no it was never wrong when they had to turn and prophesy against the very shook that protected him all them years that became a different thing and they began to pull away and when the shot pulled away it brought that seed right into the presence of the Sun William random was walking into light you're walking in the light hey this scene ain't going back down on the ground right we're not repeating John 12 24 we're in seed time this is bright time this is Rapture time the next thing we're going to hear is that combine come by it's going to sweep that wheat gonna throw it up in the air and while it's in the ass Gonna Change us from mortality immortality but we gotta walk in the light brother Branham grew we got to grow now after you walk for a while then after a while you're going to come through some things you have to learn how to stand your ground don't back up this ain't called the bread of Affliction for nothing you're going to be tested for what you believe but when you have done all the stand stand there for and then he'll tell you what you're girded with whole arm of God fighting the greatest battle ever fought but you stand for the word you stand for him he'll stand for you now we come to run you gotta run I'm running is more intense more exertion it speaks more of striving this has to do with let me just say it like this running the race of faith let me tell you why I say that because that's what really the whole book of Hebrews is about Paul writing to the Hebrews to tell them that no longer had to be Hebrews Hebrews ain't what you do with your coffee nah nah they'll get it tomorrow y'all we're in Georgia a lot of South Carolinians here too and y'all heard me say it before and you still didn't catch it laughs now this speaks of writing the race with endurance let me tell you why this is on my heart let's take a few truths or metaphors to consider this truth of us running taking hold of this message and running with it run now people some people run from something others run to something and then some run for something Joseph ran from Potiphar's wife I'm glad your boy should run she got his coat but never his character I show you the Bible which we all have done where men ran to Jesus oh that's the best place I know to run when you're in trouble run to Jesus he's a strong and mighty Tire the righteous run into and they're safe but then there's some that run for something he said well what are you running for well it's shooting popularity if you're running for popularity you're in the wrong message that's right we're running for something but what are we running for listen here's what we're really running for we're running for a prize this is the Bible I'm just talking about the Bible now you're running to obtain something and why do you run up tank you're running to obtain an Incorruptible crown brother when I think of the people out here that are Runners and these marathons and I see what they do to bring their body and subject to the runner race I think oh God where are we at spiritually I just preaching the other night on Paul's saying when he come to the end of this road I fought a good fight I finished my course henceforth had laid up for me a crown of writing Brethren said not all together a crown like a goat Crown your head but to be crowned with righteousness he said a body without sin we're talking about a new body I'm running to get out get out to another one this one's I didn't know this one could give you so much trouble and he's telling me to wait your brother's ever had kidney stones yeah nurse told me one night said you know what happened to kidney stone is much like having a baby I never had one of those she said I have and I've had a kidney stone and the pain is much like I said that's the case now as a woman my husband only had one baby that have been it I might have been divorced but there'd be one baby unless unless he loves me enough give me one of them long needles you sit there and laugh while babies are coming out that ain't God's way I'm talking about spiritually I'm not condemning you I'm just saying there's birth pains everybody say Amen now Paul is writing this race of Faith let me get to the race of faith he's trying look at the crowd he's preaching to he's preaching the ground he even says something one day you did run wild but what's him to do you say race of Faith yeah he said you did run Rebels having begun the spirit now you think you're made perfect for the flesh received you the Spirit by The Works of law or by the hearing of faith he spends the previous chapter riding on the great Heroes of Faith I mean starts with Abel and goes all the way through he gets to the 10th chapter verse 38 any man draw back my soul had no pleasure then go through all the heroes of the faith and come to chapter 12 and say now we're surrounded by a great cloud of wind I just preached them to you chapter 11 is your great cloud of witnesses amen are you going to see something just a minute but he never admonishes us to watch the cloud of witnesses he's just telling you other men has ran before you and if they can make it you can make it but you've got to keep your eyes on the same thing they have their eyes on I'm gonna get ahead of myself but we ain't looking the preachers he said looking unto Jesus your eyes have got to be on Christ you put them on anything else you're going to stumble you're going to fall by the wayside you're gonna get tired you're gonna get wore out let me go on he's bringing these because Paul whole theme of his mission I've been preaching it back home been on a couple weeks now on the book of Hebrews in chapter one it's the great exaltation of Jesus Christ he is magnifying Jesus in the eyes of these people and the reason for that is it's because they looked at a lot of other shadows and symbols and different things he said but every one of those shadowed symbols has all been fulfilled in one man and that one man is Jesus now you ask me do I believe in a one-man message you better believe I do and that one man's called Jesus Christ yes I do you say what about brother Branham it's not brother Branham it's Christ it ain't even you it's Christ we ain't nothing that's got to be Christ this ain't me it's Christ the gospel is not about us it's about Christ I've heard some preachers preach well I'll just leave it alone they preach more about a woman they do Jesus this ain't the gospel of the bride of Christ The Gospel Christ he just married a bride Christ is what should be preached now listen every believer that's in this race you are running for your life let me Express a little bit running top 10 an Incorruptible Crown running to win abrupt now I'm not this kind of guy it says winning don't matter I said listen here if women don't matter why y'all keeping score y'all trying to get me to act like I don't care so y'all can win you know what I'm talking about I used to coach and it was them politically correct mamas that made a bunch of wimp out of our boys just give them a reward for participants oh no one woman told me they the head man come out there said preacher I know you're not used to this but we're now got to mix boys and girls I said oh Lord have mercy I said so what's happening he said nobody's got a girl in their team but you I said send her owned first practice I ran them until their guts were coming out we ran the first then I said run to doubles then I said run like you hit a triple run like you hit a uh in the park home run I said let's start over run to first do it double do a trip time I was done that girl was dragging she went to mama said I don't want to be on this team I said glory to God by the way we didn't even have to hit her with a baseball that was the next move uh some of you didn't like that and that's the Holy Ghost Field but everybody here now this that worrying ain't just for boys or girls it's both men and women but we're all in one body where he says there's neither male nor female but we're all one in Christ Jesus my wife's gotta run your brother's wives gotta run you women your husbands have got it everybody's gotta run you're in the look and that's why I say that if I give up my wife needs to keep running blessed hurts salvation ain't tied to mine she's got an individual affair with Christ if I've fallen away inside she can go on with Christ she's in this race herself come on now each one of us are running and we're running brother because when you know why time's about over with eternity it's about time is blending eternity we're at the end of everything look at Martin Luther when God showed him a light he grabbed that baton brother he ran with his message do you realize if Martin Luther could have lived long enough he didn't believe John Wesley's message but he couldn't live long enough so when he was done running Wesley picked up the Baton and he had to run that's right and Wesley if he had lived long enough when the writer went on into the Pentecostal message yeah but he couldn't live long enough so then they hand it off to the Pentecostals and the Pentecostals Ran So Far and if they had kept running they'd come right where we're at tonight now here's what I'm telling you that badon is in your hand listen to me folks there ain't nobody coming after you this is the group that's going to finish this race and all of them back there can't be made perfect without us we've got to finish this race and we've got to finish it strong listen they'd say oh brother Branham I heard people say the other day brother Branham he he plays Rise Place her eyes I said y'all are you really that ignorant that you don't understand that brother Brandon preached Luther's message Wesley's message Pentecostal message he gleaned from a lot of those Brethren because there was truth often amazes didn't come to bring a different message he come to take all the loose sins and tied up it don't bother me he quoted other men that means that God had truth even in their mother ages [Applause] that light came that fire came that terrifier came and did what took all the Lucy and death of me and tied it all up together and gave us a perfect word of God in his age and with this message amen amen look how many years you said 50. two years look how long brother Dales ran brother Samuel death look how long he's ran with this message now I don't know how long he'll be here I hope he's here to Jesus Christ but I don't know I don't know if I'd be here to Jesus comes but if God leaves him and here and takes me I want to finish strong I want to leave an example behind for others if he can do it I can do it but you notice what we're seeing now listen what we're seeing now hate to say it we're seeing less runners I hate to say it but the further it goes y'all don't expect to get bigger could get less look you can't look there's people I'd love to if y'all don't have it here but I'd love to flip the pyramid upside down I'd love to I'd love to start out small and get wide but a donut starts out wide and gets small gets to get into the minority all the time now I said the other day at our church I said you realize Peter preached one sermon Holy Ghost Field man one sermon he goes three thousand Souls was added to the church it takes all of us preachers together to preach 3 000 sermons just get one Soul at it now very few coming now coming less Runners yeah less runners but there's still a group ain't gonna quit running God's got some people right here gonna run all the way to perfection you've got a little bit of water I could have a matter of fact it's sitting on your desk I I stole one out of that refrigerator foreign he told me I could have it I just need this one I throw this dry can I have a couple more minutes less less running I'll tell you why in just a second 7 26 give me about 15 minutes I can't preach all this tonight it's impossible I hope I gave you something think about all I know is what they had in that way Great Wide age we got it today same message Paul preach we got it right here tonight that ain't guesswork we got the same revelation if you brought the Apostle Paul back here tonight stood him in this Pulpit he preached William Bradley's message if you took William Bradham and put him in public he wrote 13 books of the Bible he preached the same message Paul preached had no Church of God Boy tell me how in the world could you believe that me and two thousand years apart preached the same gospel I said you're looking at the two men I'm looking at the source they got it from [Applause] that's why they got the same Revelation they got it from the exact same source Cornerstone becomes headstone I've used this one all over the world what is that I appreciate your your church I said you figured out what it is now didn't you I think you said the handkerchief last time that's a tile be more definitive it's a rag put in this pocket right what if I switch this rack to this pocket did I change the rag I'll just change the location from the left pocket to the right pocket if I take the Cornerstone down here and make it to headstone is it a different Stone no it's just a different location but it's the same Stone the Cornerstone has now become The Headstone the alphas become the Omega first match and last match identically the same he turned our hearts back to the faith of the apostolic fathers we got that message but with the maturity to take this and run it to the Rapture to perfection now Paul in several places spoke of this race not just read them to you quickly First Corinthians 9 24. no you not they that run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain we ain't running just to be running we got a purpose five seven you did right well who did handle you should not obey the truth I won't get into you know the history of them judaizers coming to trying to mix it all with Grace they do the same thing they try to mix illegalism with Grace if it don't work that's why people are getting out of the race Christ look rules is not going to hold people they've got to be born again young people if you don't get an experience with Christ this message will become a real book to you and after a while you'll get tired of the rules and that old nature will drive you to the world you'll play along until you get old enough to disobey without getting a whooping if I told my boys all six of them I said you live in my house I know you ain't got no conviction so you're going to borrow mine until you get your own and I said if I don't I'll whip you to the fire alarm goes off bless God around my house we believe in capital punishment all right I'm kidding I'm kidding corporal punishment we didn't stick there this stuff is sticking our nose in a come on man I love them days I had a daddy about Aaron's size there son and when he hit you my daddy believed your brains were born low and the more you got whipped the higher your brains were the smarter you got hey man man that size hit you it didn't take a lot of licks to smarten you up hated to hear my daddy say son this hurts me as much as I want to say you ain't nothing but a lie I know this ain't hurting you as much as this give me that belt we'll see if it hurts you as much as it does me took me in there one time caught me doing something well son I wouldn't do this if I didn't love you Daddy just hate me a while forget this love business y'all know what I'm talking about your daddy's a big man get a hold of you yes sir I pressed toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus look the great event is simply this it's a race and there's only one way to get in it it's a race of faith but if I'm taught us a Christmas where God reveal what is faith what's the new birth it's the Revelation faith is a revelation what's the new birth in Revelation of Jesus Christ personally revealed to you isn't that good God brings a revelation right down to your heart come bypass everybody come right to you he came to you called you out that legalist holding this church call me out of one of them too had a preacher y'all know doctor well we called him doctor brother Lee Vale he called me one time he's crazy I don't mean that disrespectful just what he said when he called my wife said let me talk to Lukey dookie my wife said I think one of your uncles is on the phone she thought it was mindful I went the phone I said who is this he said he said foreign what you talking about the man who wrote the church you called me looky dookie and what his question was did you come out the one that's Apple start at church I said yes sir he said how in the world you do that I said because God called me out that's the only way I came out because God caught me he said there wasn't a lot of them that came out of that to this message it was all from all them other groups but very few from that Pentecost said that's where he called me from it's like he was shocked brother I don't care where they are God called A Man Out of Hell if he has to if he's predestinated see this message got to get him he brought something else out of lowest hell there was and brought us to this message all the time I don't care where your son is maybe sitting in jail and I hate Beyond God's help your daughter might be on drugs she ain't Beyond God's help God could get anybody anytime he wants to [Applause] and I don't like when God gets a hold of him rather than when I get hold of him they don't last long when I get them God gets and they last a long time my boy Jeremiah is he here tonight I don't know why he's not he lived closer than anybody Jeremiah so you know all my kids come out their mama's womb and that my wife didn't stay home three weeks making me wait hand and foot she had a baby and well the next week was already back in church these women today they milk it son they milk it month pass oh my toe still hurts go get me a drink oh y'all ain't gonna like me when I'm done they won't Brothers don't let them suck you in that stuff come on man get to church we go down to church my kids were raised in them and I'll tell you how God can do I had a boy about 17 18 years old Jeremiah y'all home folk know this story and I was sitting in my office one day let's go to South Africa to preach and my wife comes and said you ever thought about taking Jeremiah I said Mama I said Jeremiah by the way I said I'd never call my wife Mom I thought that was stupid her old Charlie Cox call his wife mama said what's wrong with that man man's crazy car that ain't his mama that says why I'd never do here I did all I say is Mama I said I'm just as crazy as Charlie Cox but I had so many kids they go ask your mama go ask your Mom after a while Mama became mama right and I become Daddy go tell Daddy go ahead daddy you want something drinking yeah Mama messed up I said Mama He's not gonna go that that boy's a mama's boy that's the truth I said he came hard to get a glass of water without you and I said and I sure ain't ironing is closed for two weeks she said well I'll teach him my mama taught me to iron I said I was early in the field 16 years old I was full-time in the ministry I said mama taught me to iron my clothes I said you teach them how to iron so she wouldn't I said let's go ask him and I'll tell you the truth I was hoping he said no because that's going to cost me twenty four hundred dollars I didn't want him to go I didn't need him I don't need no chaperone I had brother Bill another brother I'll need that boy that's a lot of money take that knucklehead with me she said but someone she wanted him to go so she went and asked him now bro when I'm finished you'll know why God put on her heart to want her boy to go bill you were there brother Bill back there and she went back and said Jeremiah would you like to go to South Africa your daddy they had the same conversation about ironing clothes and she told us I'll teach you she come back and said he said he goes Lord have mercy I got on the line and I pulled up a ticket and I bought it got him sitting right beside me both trips brother Bill we had to buy about four tickets he went with me first service we had brother Bill what is half the size of this church right here not to them polls maybe just two seats back Jeremiah's sitting here with brother Mike Hunter says would be on one side and brother bill on the other side I carried bills with me everyone said I had Bill Williams Bill Cartridge I said as long as I got these bills with me I'll never be broke I always got bills I was in his office a little office about like this when I was in there in the sermon that I had to preach brother wait I kid you not it just left me and man I instantly started shaking and you preachers still shake before y'all go to preach you better be glad you do I started shaking I got down on my knees and so Lord I don't know what's happened I said but the message was burning me it's not on me I said what's going on and I kid you know not an automobile it's just something in my heart this I felt led to open to John 5 I opened to John 5 started reading and I read where the angel come down and stirred the water and I went out there and preached that whosoever will can come but not winsoever in other words you can only come when God calls the Angels got to start if the Angels started water it's just water but the angel stirs of water It's Supernatural then I started preaching that didn't I bill and all of a sudden I heard somebody crying about halfway that man look back and tears are rolling down Jeremiah's face I said surely not I kept preaching I cut that sermon off short said anybody here I don't know why that doesn't know Christ that would like to receive him oh Jeremiah's hands went up in South Africa that boy gave his heart to Christ Mama probably did this like sister Brandon when she went brought that Bible she was embarrassed when brother but you realize of all the Bibles there was Sister Brandon was ready to get to that Bible God was user to buy that Bible for Christmas for brother Branham that was the will of God to write their laws and you couldn't find the word of God being worked out that boy gave his heart to Lord we went back to the room I knelt down in the living room brother building and went to bed I knelt down the living room put the coverage cut over my head and was just praying really I was thanking the lord for what he did in that service and then I felt somebody come behind me and I quickly pulled the covers back and Jeremiah was sitting on the couch tears rolling out his face said what's wrong son he said Daddy tonight I surrendered my whole heart to the Lord Jesus I said well son you've been around me heard me preach you know what you got to do when we get home we'll bet he's at home Daddy I can't wait till we get home I got to be baptized now Amen brother I knew God was at work some people want to put you on a schedule I get back five six months down the road oh no God deals with you and you repent get to the water get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Gotta Give me the Holy Ghost brother we that I called that Pastor said brother I don't know how to tell there's another passive but I was preaching for that next boy I said I don't know how to say this but my I come to South Africa my boy got saved he said really I said yeah he wants baptized well he said let's baptize him filled the pool up I went down there about four or 500 people and I baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he has never been the same [Applause] God he can call it Preacher's Son or he can call a drug addict or a prostitute or anybody else he can told him by his grace and put him in this great race you know what I tell my boys when daddy's dead and gone you keep running with this message if God reveals it to you hey I'll say it if God reveals unto you they're in the devil in hell that can take it out of you there ain't enough false prophets you can take your eyes off this message if God ever reveals it to you but if somebody talks you in if somebody can talk you out of it but if God reveals it to you nobody'll ever talk you out of it let me tell you why I said all that because it's personally revealed to you when God reveals it to you brother you're in this race and you've got to run it it's in your hands you've got to run this race now look I've seen it I hate to say it but now we're starting I said the other day called a preacher from South Africa brother what's going on I said look brother brother Branham he witnessed Janice and jabras dathan corn balams witnessed all that right there at the time of the shook I submit you I hate to say it but we're starting to see that Judas Spirit raise up now kissing the door to the Rapture and going to the tribulation period I said yes sir that spirit's starting to be sown and we're seeing a great Falling Away taking place brother but While others are falling away boy I'm gripping it tired and I ever could because I know before falling before there can be a calling way there's got to be a falling away and if we're seeing a falling way that means that's fixing to be a colony away he's fixing to take a bride holding the glory you've got to get into personally yes yes preachers are dropping out just close close friends of mine I mean it baffles you when you see that happen what in the world these men are preach this message and the truth is look this knowledge up here ain't going to hold you it's got to get down in here right you you can't look you can run this a while but if you ain't ordained to be on that track buy the new birth your legs are going to start wobbling I mean you can rough around you get on that curb start coming on the other side brother your legs start wobbling if ain't no New Birth there but if that's a new birth there you'll keep right on moving with the word old Napa time following that light keep on running this race not just preachers laity we're shocked at the people we see Fall Away and we don't rejoice in it it's sad sad brother we don't rejoice in seeing people walk away it hurts us to see that happen but you can't run it without the new birth that's a little seemed like almost a paradox run with patience the race I don't even associate where patience would run and man when I think of running when I was a kid I ran one time from the law and Sunday with nothing patient about it me and my cousin that boy never could outrun me but when we saw them four cop cars coming by the way they never did find us we ran we knew that neighborhood like the back of our hand we jumped fences and went through porches and everywhere else ended up in the same house we started that they never did find us and we made 40 bucks off of that there wasn't no patience about that someone you run you run but this is that word patience there is the word endurance and here's another thing that word race look it up it's where we get the word agony conflict and you're going to have a lot of it you're gonna face it and when you face it it ain't that you've conquered everything it's just that now you can face everything that's something that holds you when you can't hold yourself that birth will hold you to Christ it will give you a tire post you see people fall around you you don't put your eyes on them put your eyes on Christ keep it there you keep running I wish I had more time man right in this shipwreck beat jailed fought with beasts at Ephesus stood for the word look at the what the man went through but he said I finished my course I fought a good fight hey I've run the race ain't nothing better than coming to the end of knowing ain't no trouble down at the river I finish this thing strong right yeah let me tell this story then I'll move to one more and I'll close when I was younger I still walk walk three to five miles a day walk a little fast but I walk let me down and I run maybe a block that can't run like I used to run the other day I got some pain in my knee and I said that's I said that's not supposed to be there but I run every now and then my daddy when I was young I ran the mile and I played baseball in a ran the miles and my time in Florida I know it's hard to believe it was under six minutes and it won the whole state of Florida and they wanted me to go to West Virginia run on the national but I had an All-Star Game and I've never taken running over baseball but in that race coach called me my own coach said son this is what he said there's a black boy on that side and I already knew he says what my coach said you can't beat him just do your best well my dad was standing behind and heard that man say that in my dad's blood went to the top of his head he was mad hey hold up hold up here son Daddy called me all of a sudden that's what he said don't you listen to what he said he said if he can't tell you how to win I'll tell you how to win I said Daddy how am I going to beat that guy he's fast they said I don't care how fast he is I don't want you to beat him I want you to run on his heels he said you just patiently stay on his heels run three laps it's taken four he said you run the first thing just stay on this hill but don't you ever pass him just make him conscious that you're there he said in that last lap you've given everything you got son a lot of preachers give you false information but we've had Daddy come down this hour he's told us how to win this race these instructions you know I followed that boy for three Laps on his heels and at the whole time he's running he's doing like this pay attention to me and the more he's turning his head the more he's extra is exuding energy my daddy knew that I didn't know that I wouldn't had a clue about that I would have tried to stay beside him and beat him the whole time my dad said don't you do it Stillness that last lap I could hear my daddy give it give it at me think you got hey son I took off I beat him by half of a lap he was whipped he didn't have no strength and that coach over there his whole face only person screaming was my daddy That's my boy brother daddy knows how to win this race I'm telling you there's something about Daddy's instructions you realize even when Jesus went down there he never saw him about my mama's business I'm about my father's business hey this message is the father's business he come to bring us a message to finish this race and finish it strong [Music] let me give you one in closing got about four things I only got 29 pages of notes so I'll skip the 28. let me tell you how you're going to win it when Paul wrote Hebrews 11. before he wrote Hebrews 12 he went the whole line of people that ran by faith even during the law before law ever came he picked up Abraham Abraham's for the law Paul picked it up he said I was alive without the law once that was Abraham law comes sin revived that's Moses I died and then he brought you to Christ and no matter which men you took back there they all ended with Christ no matter what type you took it ended with Christ they were all parts of the body he was the head everyone that men was pointing to this man so after Paul preaches Hebrews 11. and he comes to Hebrews 12. he said looking not unto Abraham not to Moses not debating not to David not to looking under the greatest looking at the one they were all looking to looking unto Jesus the author the one that began it and the finisher of your faith so I don't matter who I look no no yes it does you better keep your eyes on Christ you say eyes you know can I tell One More Story he ain't here tonight I wish he was old Ben Bowen any y'all know who Ben Bowen is and don't go to church with us anybody know Ben Bowen look him up on Facebook he's on there get a good look at him when I coached his daddy came to me said wrote Luke said uh you think men can play for you I said you ever played ball he said no I said well bring him out he come up and he's one of them guys that you give about three outs and a bat and say son you did good go sit down he couldn't hit the broadside of a barn I didn't know lie left-handed boy I worked with him all year long he batted every game never could hit the ball we was 11 no come to 12th game and base his reload is no joke two outs who come up brother Keith oh Ben I said dear Jesus it's over and I got a thought I said time blue I called Ben over on third base line I caught him up close to me I said Ben anybody don't know what I'm saying to him this is what I said I said Ben your daddy told me you still sleep with your mama he told you I said yeah he told me everybody thinks I'm giving a good baseball talk I said I promise to the Lord if you don't keep your eye on this ball and hit it I'm telling everybody this game you still sleep with your mama he said you wouldn't do it I said try me [Applause] Son by the way I've never seen a kid more focused in all my life son I mean his eye was I said watch it out I've always talked watch it out of the hand watch how that boy was so focused Brothers wait I tell you the truth that kid hit that ball so far out there we scored and won that game everybody's coming what did you say I suggest between coach and player I said I just just came a good talking to you know what he recognized don't care what you do you go out and drive tonight it's gonna make a difference where your eyes are at you young people keep your eyes off the phone keep it on the road those kids have lost their life cause of distract that'd be a good message distractions makes a difference where you place your eyes nothing wrong with respecting preachers and different you should you should do that right but no matter what happens to anybody as one man you better keep your eye on and that's the Lord Jesus Christ you keep your eye on him you'll finish this race strong amen [Applause] musicians come please if you would [Applause] could we stand together and just I like just Bauer hit just a moment I have a word of prayer and turn it back to our pastor or whoever is coming you love him tonight how many wants to finish this strong would you just lift your hands to the Lord now father thank you for your word tonight thank you for this lovely group of people Lord just pulled on the word oh God we thank you for this hour that we live in we thank you for the grace that you have bestowed upon us and called us O Lord and we don't believe father that you'll start something that you won't finish because you're the author and the finisher you will complete what you started these people's lives are in your hands and Lord I pray that every one of them will keep their eyes upon you and refuse to take it off don't let don't let politics don't let the world don't let all this stuff going on Satan's eat and all this noise and these voices just let them turn it all off and keep their eyes right on this word Lord let everything go to the side help us to keep our eye on you Lord pray you bless this congregation bless our pastor here Lord May the Holy

name [Music] thank you Father [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the truth away I bless your name [Music] pretty good message let's give the Lord a handclap good job brother that was good hey man you know I was thinking that and we all kind of have a little bit of an athletic background but when you're running when you're running a a race especially a four-man relay you put the best man at the end you got your Pacers you got your starters but that last guy as soon as he grabs that baton he's got to make up time or he's got to keep the pace going and I believe that's what we are the prophet went off the scene he handed that baton to us he handed it to us and you know what he done he gave us all the training yeah he gave us the best shoes he gave us the best message he gave us the best preachers he gave us the best laity he gave us the best song leaders and song musicians I don't hear any clapping this is the best and Paul is even the man that said let's run this race amen he's waiting on me and you he's waiting on me and you he's in that other dimension over there he's sitting he's waiting when that call comes it's got to come from a bride yeah right hey man the last baton is a body change it's been handed to me and you what are we going to do with it dude that's bro Luke said run and but run with patience you know you can run so fast you can trip and fall done that before yeah he runs so fast you can trip and fall that's not that's why I said run with patience you pick your pace your pace may be faster than others you may Pace may be slower than others but I like where brother Luke said because we've been preaching on Statue of perfect man for a a long period of time but that's the Running part we're at the Running part we're we're here where we can get it right I appreciate my dad and the different ones and some of the older brother brother Mike hantus not calling you old brother Mike but some of the old ones older ones brother there was a lot of there was a lot of brush in the message Woods you couldn't see a lot all they saw was a messenger and then there was all kind of doctrines went through that all kinds of things and you couldn't see but praise God brother Mike my dad different ones the older ones they took the sword of the word and they cut that thing back and they cut us a trail so that we can finish this race that's just what I believe because I went through as a kid I went through all that you heard this one preach this one you had to follow this one you had to follow that one listen if you don't fall across you're following the wrong person period period if you're not following Christ wrong person period I don't care you can put whatever name you want to in that that's right but as we follow it but said Paul says follow me as I fall across all right so as brother Branham followed Christ we're going to follow right in line amen and you know what he's even waiting on us he's waiting on us and I I I I sometimes I Bro Look I think God maybe lets him look over in this Dimension every once in a while not see the bad I don't want him to see that part the people leaving and all I want him to see a congregation that's worshiping God under the message of the hour under the final voice to the final age under her messenger that's us we do have something to say we have something to say and I believe we're saying that I believe we're taking this thing and we've got to write baton we've got the right race and like bro Luke said you know you can get people that run a race and they'll get distracted yeah and but if I promise you if you put your eye on on a certain spot as that little boy with a bicycle you know he said how'd you get through that he said well I didn't look down at the wheel right he said I looked out there now when you're driving a car try it sometime you drive a car look straight down over your over your hood straight down you'll do this all the time yeah but look out there amen look out see the prize when you see that prize we're heading toward it we know what the prize is we know that so we're going to run to that prize and that we're going to run as brother said to a body change God bless you we love you thank you for all coming I wish you could have come tomorrow and finish the rest of it but I know how that is I'm on a sermon tomorrow be 125 on the Statue of perfect man so I'm just slow Southern boy but if you don't have anywhere to go tomorrow we'll be here tomorrow and uh and brother Luke will be in his place and and we'll get him back and and preach
