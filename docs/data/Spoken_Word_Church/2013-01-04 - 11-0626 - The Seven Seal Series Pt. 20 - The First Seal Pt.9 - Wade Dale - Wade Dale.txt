========================================

Ezekiel 28. I want to thank sister Susan for bringing me up bringing me a tooth puller oh I'm sorry and thanks for sister Santa bringing me this because I needed a line over in this dark corner that I'm standing in um this is actually brother Tom that went on to meet the Lord this is his of you so I think he would absolutely want it to be used oh absolutely for his purpose anything to do with the word of God he was all for it and you know what if he was still here yes he would anyway you're exactly correct all right Ezekiel 28. we're still on the man of sin 28 Ezekiel 28th okay yeah everybody there Ezekiel chapter 28. so this is talking about a natural king king of tire and let's see how this evolves and we're still in the first seal we're still in the mystery of iniquity because as the first seal is open we see that God was unfolding himself to the people but remember Satan right behind him unfold trying to unfold himself in what remember what we were talking about last Sunday he was not unfolding himself in a drunk and the prostitutes and you know the the people of the world know he was unbounding himself as a white righteous church he was hid in that white righteous horse that that charger that rider that's going out that John admired and thought was so beautiful this church because I was just symbols not a horse it's a power um John did see a church which was the Roman Catholic church or whatever you want to call it but he saw all the Pomp and Circumstance he loved it he won again he would it kind of made John want to become churchy kind of like we don't need to be we need to be churchy all right but he admired it with great admiration now let's look at this king of tire which tire was on the coast and you can call it Tyrus is the place there was a king there and he was right on the coast and then a lot of merchandise came through there a lot of traffic because he was kind of like the headwaters of the Mississippi not the headwaters but the down at the bottom of Mississippi the mouth of the Mississippi where all the Commerce had to come right by him okay but watch how this evolved into a man the man of sin because watch this the word of the Lord came again unto me saying son of man say unto the prince of Taurus thus saith the Lord God okay son of man so the son of man's got to be on the scene for this to happen all right in Ezekiel you'll see many many times Ezekiel the the uh the word coming to Ezekiel say son of man prophesied I like the Book of Ezekiel it's a very very neat book to read thus says the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas all right what's water what seas people all right I sit in the midst of the people yet thou art a man and not God so this Spirit has taken on the form of a man we don't Satan's not a man like you and I but incarnate in somebody he is a man all right yet thou art a man and not God though thou set thine heart as the heart of God conquering and to conquer riding on a white horse making yourself look religious Satan does not want you to tell any difference this is the point I want us to see about this first seal Satan does not want you to look at him and look at God and see a difference right he does not want you to look at God and look at him and see a difference because when you see a difference that's what the prophet came to he saw a difference he saw something separate going away when you've got something going away from him it's an opposition right okay because the pool brings everything to you it brings God to you it brings the angel to the Lord it brings the word of God to you but if you see something riding away from you that's something that was a part of you but it's gone all right but in this right here we see that thou art sent thine heart as the heart of God he wants you to believe he's God right there's the mystery of iniquity not that we can be so bad that we see it but is that we can be so good and be black inside that's all right and act like a Christian that's right act I don't want to be an act you know somebody said well we're actors and that's okay brother Brian said we're actors in a play but I don't brother Brown said the word Pharisee means actor I don't want to be that kind of an actor because they were acting the part of God all right Satan can't be God but he can be so close to God because he's Supernatural all right with thou wisdom no I'm sorry verse three excuse me behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee so see the things that God has revealed to you and I the things that are locked up in the word of God Satan's already had first first dim them Satan is a spiritual being he catches a spiritual application of things he can't get a revelation and be a a part of God but he can feel the pull of that Revelation he can feel that God's moving to remember my brother I said he said if I start thinking about God he said if I start saying something said Satan will come right in there and you know he's right there if I say I'm going to do something he said the kids will start crying the phone will start ringing you know and the wife will drop something on the floor and he says but if I keep it in my heart if I keep it in my heart he says they can't get in there okay so this is what this is Behold our wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee with our wisdom and thy understanding see understanding see brother Brown said Satan has a knowledge on the Revelation he has a knowledge in other words he can read because the Bible says that the angels believe in one God and tremble Satan makes man believe in the Trinity and laughs at us because he knows that we're down here less reform but he can what overpower us if we let him and we just believe the Trinity and go around with our wisdom and thy understanding thou Hast gotten the riches and has gotten gold and silver into thy Treasures by thy great wisdom and by that traffic has thou increased thy riches and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus saith the Lord God because thou has set thine heart as the heart of God now this is the problem thus saith the Lord God because now I sent thine heart is the heart of God this is what's going to happen because when you said your heart as the heart of God but you live like the devil but you act like a Christian this is what's going to happen behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee strange docs strings strange ideas strange ways strange thinking the terrible of the Nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom now watch Satan everything he touches it destroys right because that's just the way he is he perverts and if you pervert anything unless it comes out of that it's going to stay perverted all right because he's turned Kings against Kings people against people trying to conquer this world he turned Angels against God so he surely ought to be working on us right you know trying to get us right and shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom great swelling words of wisdom coming from a Pulpit and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit Thou shalt die of the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the Seas in other words every death he's going to be remember brother Brown said every day is going to be heaped on his head every sickness is going to be heaped on Satan's head everything's going to be heat on this devil that we're talking about wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth Thee I am God in other words in other words watch his attitude I know one thing's for sure if brother Donnie created me and brought me into this world and I knew that and gave me Supernatural power because you know there was a conversation between the two it wasn't just that God made the devil and he just went off and started being bad now there was a conversation and never got a thought in his mind well thou yet say before him that slayeth Thee I am God in other words he's telling God he's God now and that's what he's been talking about in the scripture I want to be like God and then in Thessalonians he's setting a seat as God he don't want no subjection that's what iniquity is that's no suggestion if you commit iniquity that means you knew better so you got a headship you knew better everybody understand you knew that right here's knowing better yes you did it anyway what'd you do you superseded or went before your headship right that's right and we do it all the time people we do we do it all the time that's right we got to quit doing that that's right because this supposed to show us so when I say that first seal is very important this is to show us where the devil is sinning you said well I knew he was in my brain no you gotta really know that he's really there all the time and you got to make a choice remember I wrote that on the board on that long time ago Choice that's right because choose you this day whom you'll serve right Norbert black no that's right okay because we all got it the unpopular belief if you don't find a war in your members right now then the devil has got you hooked right the devil has got you now if you don't have a battle in your mind brother Brown said this thing right here will be sticky until the chain so we're not going to like daddy's been preaching we're not going to walk into something and start getting so perfect that we have no bad thoughts no we're going to go come to realization one day though that that's nothing that that's not that's the power that saved holes on us and what power is that something you can't see something you fabricate in your mind it's not even real it's not even real remember the old saying you know you you say well I think Mom's talking about me because she looked over here one time she's talking to sister back they ain't talking about me no remember 99 of the time they're usually talking about themselves and the problems they got not the problem they got with you okay right that's right so we were we going around the world worrying half the time about what people think about it and who is that doing that Satan likes to do what divide and conquer that's right okay now let's be real as human beings before we finish reading this because this is going to come from the human man down we're going to see Satan here because see in verse 13 it shows you what's going on this man was not in the Garden of Eden this Prince of Tire this real guy that's standing there that ezekiel's looking at and talking about but he but Ezekiel sees the spirit behind that Prince of Tire the real man standing there and says oh you go back to the Garden of Eden when you walk right here verse 13 thou has been in Eden the Garden of God so see he's he's picked what does he do he picked up the spirit of the man not so much the man standing there but this he sees the spirit of that man and then the Holy Spirit takes him back to the Garden of Eden he says hey this is where it all began that's why this Prince of Tyler loves merchandise he loves money he loves gold he loves silver he loves all these things the love of money is the root of all evil not money but the Love of Money all right amen all right so here we got a person standing here but watch how Satan comes in and Ezekiel through the son of man through the Holy Spirit he divides that thing up okay you and I wait we they sometimes that y'all don't like about meeting somebody I don't like about you that's just human things we got to get over that stuff that's right I mean not get over to what I say well I'll put up with you no I may not put up with you but um but you're still my brother and sister when we come talking about the Lord that ought to bring everybody together that's right whether you like apple pie or cherry pie and you try to feed me cherry pie I don't like cherry pie now strawberry pie I love strawberry pie but cherry pie I don't want too much don't try to feed me that right but we're upset and talk about the word of God all day long you can get Cherry Pie and I'll set then pray for strawberry pie yeah you understand what I'm saying is these little things that Satan it's a little foxes that spoil the mind even as Christians all of us coming together even as a church group everybody's looking for a perfect Church there is no perfect church because Satan's in every one of them right every one of them but the word of God is the most powerful thing right the word of God is the most powerful force see Satan can hide behind Paul Stockman and he can work his way through it just by false documents being preached but if we believe that that false Doctrine is not being preached in this church he can't hide there so he'll say well brother Donnie he's he he goes to ball games and boy we just need to and that's not true but I'm just saying for an example so we don't want we don't have nothing to do with him because he's you know or if this one's got this if you're of the devil you're going to manifest yourself somewhere that's right this Prince of tire was probably just a natural common man he liked money he liked but he didn't think a thing about God but Ezekiel would look at him and say okay you principal Tire you're doing this you have the characteristics of the devil then the Lord just breaks him into a vision and shows that Spirit go all the way back to the Garden of Eden because remember that's where everything started in the Garden of Eden that's worth Satan now knowing that we've got to get our character our everything right he's attacking families marriages children any little thing he can get and muzzle up your mind and if and it's not like adultering murder and all that nobody does that that's little just a little stuff that he just keeps muzzling up your mind yep and the best thing to do if Abraham would have looked at all those circumstances he'd have never had a child he counted what the Bible say he counted those things that were as they were not okay that's right if I say whatever you know we gotta we got to we got to conquer that he's conquered us all this time with family splitting up and this happening like Mom said and all this stuff going on listen folks I'm telling you if you lose everything you got the Bible says if you gain the whole world and lose your soul your worst than anything in the world can happen to you he said see sorry that's right thank you for the Kingdom of Heaven if you'll put the kingdom of God first then all these other things will come it will fall in place it really will all right let's finish reading this excuse me and they shall bring thee down to the pit mercy and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slander that's the sea now wait a minute this is this great powerful guy who's they us who's they us because we give him the power to be powerful or we take the power away from him that's right right that's right verse 9. let me tell you something though people there's always been a big question mark since the beginning since the fall happened that big question mark is death therefore you're staying great words you Victory that's fine but when you come up to the point of death nobody's really been able to understand it but what did Brother Randall say that Satan was they called his name in the for sale death he said only in the last Church age was a group of people able to single him out and call him this name and when you put a name on somebody you've exposed them room of a thousand people there's only one guy in there named Wade well you don't know me from nobody if I don't call my name or somebody says hey wait well you know what thousand people know who I am I've been exposed and as I am because you've called my name my character I walk around and you might you know I'm shake hands with a thousand people he ain't doing you know never tell them a name but when somebody calls your name then you say oh you're identified right this is who you're identifying as you know why do you think these stupid actors and stuff they wear all these ball caps and sunglasses they don't want to be exposed they don't want to be they don't want to be what they don't want to be revealed they don't want people to know what they're doing well this same way we'll see he's been trying to hide but once you call that guy's name out he's in opposition to everything that we do then when you expose him sure he's gonna get mad but we must believe that greater heat is in us right because that guy has looked that's one more thing well Thou shalt bring they shall bring thee down to the pit wow a group of people finally has enough power revelation of God to bring this man down Thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the sea will thou yet stay before him that sled Thee I am God but thou shall be a man and no God in the hand of him that sleth them Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand I want you to if you don't write in your Bible but I want you to underline that if we become brothers or acquaintances with the devil we're not strangers but when we've become so much like God well Satan calls us a stranger that's what I want to be named I want to be a stranger to this Prince of time because the Stranger by the hand of The Strangers it's not just one it's a group of people right you had to hand that one I worked long time ago tonight that I got talked but we realize who sang this and if he ever tells you something it's not the word don't even quit you go right where he's coming from about uh if it's not the word but we still let him do all this product stuff in our minds and and when we know it I didn't work like that you're taking back the word every time I don't do it all the time years ago you quit preaching my sermon we're going to read you remember brother Douglas this past Sunday did y'all catch what he was reading we'll go back there and just say let's finish this because I'm going to show you the power of not just the written word as long as it's written down on paper Satan can do what program's a safe and question it but when it spoke you're not catch up what he said yes Jesus said it is written it is written the last thing he says it said written right Satan stayed there written Satan stayed there that very last thing Jesus said it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and guess what the old guy had to leave wouldn't come out of them I mean you know Jesus said it's written that site was still right there it is written Satan's still right there but when he said I say unto you right that's the way I interpret the Bible say I say unto you there in the Book of Matthew we're reading just a minute I am going but Thou shalt be a man no God in the hands of him that's Lefty Thou shalt die of the deaths of all deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for I have spoken except the Lord there's your promise right there for I have spoken that saith the Lord moreover the word of the Lord came unto me same son of man pick up a lamentation upon the king of tires and say unto him thus saith the Lord God capital L capital d o d thou sealeth of the son full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty if you come by Satan thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was I covered sergeants topaz Diamond Barrel Onyx Jasper Sapphire Emerald carbuncle gold the workmanship of thy tablets and I want you to look all those precious stones were in the breastplate of Aaron and we're in the temple look how close he was that's why Satan took Jesus and put him on top of the Temple in the middle of Jerusalem Satan wasn't scared to that Temple right he took him right up there and set him down with Papa and he wasn't scared of it but when Jesus said I say all right say it Satan I believe all right so he's not scared of a building you're not scared of a building he scared of somebody that'll that'll take this right here the workmanship of thy tablets and of that pipe was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created so now he know we know he was a created being Thou Art the anointed cherub that covered wow pretty close huh and I have sent these up who said this the Lord God remember thou was upon the holy mountain of God what scared being there was he thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire in other words ascending and descending thou was perfect in thy way from the day that thou was created till what iniquity was found in the by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God where is the Mountain of God turn around look right there that's the Mountain of God that's all the mountain God deals with that's the statue of perfect then right so what's he being he's being cast out of the Mountain of God all right cast out on the perfect man and I will destroy thee ocovering cherub from the mist of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness oh see there white righteous Church brightness he's not dark sure he's dark inside but he he likes to be Lions he likes to be like God I will cast thee to the ground and I will lay thee before kings that they may be holy remember we read last week in Isaiah is this the man Kings of the earth walk by and say is this the man that ruined the Nations okay now it's defiled by sanctuaries not buildings people that has defound the People by the multitude of non-iniquity by the iniquity of thy traffic what is traffic merchandise is selling he's selling itself therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth he got cast out I ever remember and he got brought down here but where's he going to be destroyed right here he's going to be destroyed on destroyed on the place that he tried to destroy he tried to take over this earth right in the sign of all them that behold them all they that Know Thee see all they that know them understand Know Who You Are among the people shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt be a terror and never and underline right here and put Satan's in and never shalt thou be anymore faith is gone destroy finish now let's go to Matthew or English my brother Douglas was talking about weight now is Luke I'm sorry Luke four that's right look for it the Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit of the Wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and those days you don't know anything when they were ended here forward was hungry the devil said unto him if thou being the Son of God command these stones that it be made bread and Jesus answered him saying it is written well first verse 4. it is written if man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God the devil taking them up into a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time in other words all the way up another round for the United States right the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee all this power so he's the king of this Earth down here he's the king of all that's going on around there all right all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me where was it what we just talked about Prince of Tire he was given the control of the traffic in the merchandise and stuff like that for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will I give it who power will will power whosoever I will in other words whosoever wishes it he'll give it to him all right we know that we did that we've done that for all of our life you yield to the devil he'll give you what you want right I did it I don't know about you maybe we're born different than I was if I don't think so I ain't seen by the gray hair we all get it then we're all born saying if thou therefore will worship me all shall be done and Jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me saying before it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve and he brought him to Jerusalem the most holy city on the face of the Earth the seed of religion all right and save him on a pinnacle of the temple and I wrote my Bible a long time ago Satan was in the was in the holiest city and not afraid but he took him right straight to the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast myself down from him for it is written say he's quoting word back to him he shall give his angels charged over me over thee to keep them and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest any time that I Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus answered and said unto him it is said now who spoke that he did he wrote the word right he wrote the word but when he say I say unto you Satan Thou shalt not tempt the Lord capital L thy God there he was standing it's something spoke from the inside he said well it spoke over here so Jesus was saying it's red taking him back to the scripture which is a good way to start but somewhere down the line people we got to come down to this third pull first pull second pull you why is this three times this happened the third pull is what speaking the word right here Jesus exercise the part of the third pull he said it is said and then the devil had ended all the Temptation he departed from him for a season though be careful he didn't depart from him forever just for a season because he pounded that human being day in and day out but the Bible said yet without Sam that's uh pretty tough to say but when this man of sin is exposed and you see him going away from you you watch too you watch we'll bring your uh silver next week because we're going to read some things out of first film but once brother Branham in his early Ministry I've been reading the 54 55 56 reading the prayer lines I've been doing that for about a year you know read the book and then then read the prayer line he stalled he said I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on something well there was a man standing there a prophet of God filled with the Holy Ghost going up the statue were perfect man faith of the father and here he stands in 1959 and 60 and he says I'm waiting on him you know why I'm stalling unless he comes I can't do anything you watch him after 1963 though still in the healing part but not as much but he'll just finish preaching and he'll just start calling people out why he didn't have to wait on that man to come anymore when that man of sin wrote off in no seals and no sealed open to that prophet he said because of the supernatural element of the cause of opening these seals I say unto you I say unto you wow he had become so one not that he wasn't one with God when you're born again and it is a five-minute old babe in Christ you're just one with God right but it's like brother Dale saying that then that inside is just a baby we have to change his diapers we have to feed it God does the same thing for us he has to feed us change a diapers clean up our mess right right but as we get older that's going to be 40 year old babies 20 year old babies right okay don't be 60 year old babies okay I'm talking about in The Gospel I'm coming in the gospel ain't talking about age uh you could be born again two weeks ago and and and you know if you really truly Sanctified yourself to God during that time you probably know more than nobody than you've been in 10 years that just kind of just come to church for the heck of it really let's be honest but Satan Satan has a problem whipping they'll never one of those Faith virtue and all this information God the brother and kindness and the love of God remember we read in second Thessalonians it wasn't the truth that they didn't hear they didn't hear the love of the truth that's right the love of the truth that is that's a gobble though that's not that's not just loving to read about it you love to read the Bible and come to church and love to be with people and die and go to hell that's right but you got to know God that means knowing like a personal relationship like you know husband and wife that's knowing that's it's coming together and that's what Satan wants he wants us to stay here not here okay that's what he wants so let's commune with God more Satan comes and tells you something it might be right he told Jesus something but Jesus finally got enough of him he said it said in other words I say unto you you don't tempt me no more under this condition you're in you get out away from me and that's the way you and I need to be taken under this condition leave me alone he's going to come at you in another matter but leave me alone in this one we got to start burying some some dead people that's right we're going to start burying some dead stuff and don't try to resurrect it don't divorce it and put it in the closet where we can reach and gravity if we need it no kill it right then you'll see that opposition writing off and you know what you know why that Satan bound A Thousand Years why has he lost his power and he lost his power he's lost his power in you that's right brother Brown said he's Bound by a chain of circumstances right in other words he can't work in the people like he does did before because we're God made manifest in him body spirits and soul so it was 144 000 who have you got to work through it but see he's not finished he's not done he's still going to come up but one day it's a promise right here one day he will end if you ever want to get in the Book of Ezekiel and Satan starts crawling around in your head take him to the Book of Ezekiel show them what we just said Satan your end is right here right and it's going to be through me right you may destroy this body but in my flesh I'm going to see God in my flesh now somebody else is in mind where you go I don't want to live in somebody else's body living mine all right let's go
