on the way we'll be traveling from 10 o'clock at night till about 1 o'clock the next day so we can sleep for a little while and and rest on the way up there because it's going to be a wonderful weekend we've got everything kind of planned out we appreciate everybody that's going also i want to announce too for those of you that are going that um we found a little extra money so um the meal on friday night for supper after the bonfire or before which will be it brother christian sister crystal's house there will be pizza there so we won't have to worry about buying friday evenings meal all right also saturday evenings meal if you're still hungry for some silly reason we're going to have fried chicken and tater wedges and some rolls so they'll they'll be planning to eat we will i promise you we will not come back looking like we've been on a diet we will come back thinking and and knowing that we were allergic to all that food up there because we'd be swelled up on the way back that bus may have to put some extra gas in on the way back at least it's downhill all the way this way so but just remember those of you that are not going keep us in prayer we're going to pray over that bus we're going to anoint it with oil we're going to take some prayer cloths amen but uh it's uh we're all ready to go so uh all mine's clear listen to this i pulled up this one today and i i want to read this resurrection of jesus 19 and 56 that's what brother brown says he never sends anyone empty who comes to him and he will send you away with a full heart of joy light-footed and going down the street rejoicing and praising god as you move along but now look there's a stipulation to that now that can be done if you'll take our right attitude if we'll take our right attitude toward him if we come to see him and to love him and to worship him then god is obligated to give us them things which we desire and he will uphold withhold no good thing from them that walk up right before him just remember that his promise is if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it will be given unto you listen to this what a promise unfailing promises unfailing promises and remember the prophet of god told us that we are what feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen that's us in the end time the body word of the son of man i'm looking at it right now there is no body of jesus that i can look at today it's in another dimension actually sitting on the throne making intercession like we were talking about today making an intercession on your confession so he sent up he sent the holy ghost to a bride and now we're doing the speaking and i pray to god that we hear from him today so let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this evening thank you for the wonderful song service and the new songs that we are learning lord we we know that when we get there oh my no time no sorrow no pain we don't have to say goodbye ever again we'll be able to sing one song two psalms 10 songs 50 songs learn new songs that maybe a bride in africa can sing us a song and we'll learn it the bride in canada and we can sing it and learn it and then we'll be able to sing it for an eternity lord we long for that day but we gotta we're stuck down here right now but we're getting there we're going to make it as the song says the book's already told us that we win lord just help us through our struggles though help us through our trials and tribulations and and battles that we go through lord be with us today lord take all of our sin away lord just for a moment speak to our heart and let it be settled in us lord that we can take this word to the world that don't know anything about you the only thing they're going to know is you're here and you're living proof that you resurrected lord heal our bodies touch our souls give us a good blessing today's father be the ones that are not here the ones that are sick the ones that are traveling lord richard and anna now um timbo and his wife and family are leaving from new mexico lord just touch sister debbie raise her up for your honor and glory lord we appreciate them they they're really just dear to our heart father we pray that you'd be with each one lord other ones that are traveling our travels that we're fixing to go on and and sister crystal brother christian will be leaving on tuesday lord be with us tomorrow as we take a little vacation time and go up in the mountains and lord we'll just look around and see your beauty everywhere we go we should see your beauty now i know we see the stinking things of the world but lord there's beauty in there because it's you father just give us our daily bread jesus name we pray amen who is this son of man this would be part 49 but we're going to use pretty much the same scriptures in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly see there's no way god never set this program up for a hierarchy except for him because he's our creator he's mr perfect he's mr big god he's being he's mr god there ain't no one beside him they ain't one coming and they won them before him he's the only one there is but he decided to have kids he decided to bring us to a place and have apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists and different things like that but we should never we should always have the uh the attitude of a servant even song leaders even even school of the teachers and all we should have the the heart of a servant to where we serve me every time i walk out that door i say lord though i bear castaway though my head hurts though my feet hurt brother dales had to stand here and hold on to this pulpit and preach when he didn't feel good but you know what he did it for you no one else you i'm not doing this for myself you think i'd rather be out hunting fishing sometimes while i'm studying for two sermons and y'all are out working on cars and going to you know going places there's nothing wrong with that that's your job that's your position amen but if we all get in our position then we will what receive from god so that's why i want to receive something from god today amen i don't want to be a an overlord or a ruler no way no we want to be a servant he gave his life for us he didn't have to he washed our feet he didn't have to he gave his life for us according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith for as we as members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and one i keep reading this because as we go up the statue of perfect man if we ever get to it when we start up the statue of perfect man we're going to see those different offices working okay virtue knowledge temperance all these different things so we be many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another because remember in this body right here in this body of christ without the head now the headstone we know is here with us but we're the body so we're the hands the feet the toes the ribs the chest we're that part of god so we're many members and we move because the head tells us to move that's why we have to have a renewing of our mind like i said this morning everything if if you stay in your regular life that's what the world calls normal we're not normal by the way we act and do we're not normal wow jesus wasn't normal either they hated him they hated that man when he came up the only people that really liked him was the maniac of gadara and different ones oh thank you lord for coming according having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith you may be seated in the lord's blessing to the reading of the word we will talk about this morning we were talking about being born again now we've got to be brother brown said have faith and be born again we'll talk about that a little bit later we'll skip through this pretty quick but we as many of us are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so we are by the new birth we become sons and daughters of god amen and and we realize that yes in the listen in the mind of god we are we always were the sons of god because if you weren't there you'll never be there everybody with me but we got lost something got lost so that we can have a savior a healer we can sing the songs of redemption the angels can't sing those songs we can sing the song of redemption why because we were lost and i thank god we were lost well preacher you're tough you're you're tough you're i thank god i got lost think about that for a minute because the finding part is what i like if we have not but we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father the spirit of self bearing witness with our spirit that what that we are the children of god so you had to start as a baby you had to start as a child didn't you start your human journey as a baby as a child but like i said before you know you i don't want you to stay a baby i mean some of us are babies let's don't be 50 year old babies that's not normal and if children then heirs theirs of god and join heirs with christ listen god christ jesus is coming back after a mature bride he's not coming back after he doesn't want you to stay a baby if he didn't want you to stay a baby in your natural life he sure doesn't want you to stay a baby in your spiritual life man he wants you to grow that's what i said come to church and say teach me something lord teach me something i know some of us went to school and hated it but i didn't i liked it because i like to learn i know i'm not normal but that's okay i wanted to learn something i didn't want to stay ignorant it's not bad to be ignorant it's bad to stay ignorant because that becomes iniquity and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ whatever jesus got we got whatever christ gets we get all right so christ has these virtues and guess what he's ready to give them out to me and you if we want them amen and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together we went through justification we know one thing's for sure we needed that and we can't justify ourselves our problem is is when we justify ourself and then we make it somebody else's fault sanctification unclean spirit goes out of your soul hello somebody don't get quiet on me today now this morning y'all we're doing pretty good let's don't get quiet this afternoon you can say a man through your sleepy eyes but the unclean spirit goes out something left you you felt different what he was he was starting the renewal of your mind because listen when you was out in the world did you want to be justified oh yeah we want to be justified like the world's justified that they want to be excuse me but i'm going to say lgbt black lives matter they all want to be justified we're justified because we are brackets whatever you want to say all right i'm justified because i had somebody that did it for me i didn't depend on me or the court or i depend on god to do it and when he said in his bible that he would throw him in the sea of forgetfulness never to remember him again i'm going to take that but you and i can't do that we still remember it that's why we need a renewing of our mind but you need a heart change first because you can't think normal without the new birth i'm talking about christian normal now everybody else thinks normal because this is normal and that's normal it's okay to have this and it's okay to be a girl one day and a boy the next day and come on somebody i told you they gonna quit having gender reveal parties because you're not supposed to decide what they are they're supposed to decide who they are come on oh let a kid decide what he wants to be they ought to be the ones that get spanked not the kids whoever decides stupid stuff like that but listen that's sodom and gomorrah all over again that's the twisting of the mind that satan has twisted your mind up so bad listen i know that i'm a man because god said i'm a man but you know what though this is how satan's perverted it i'm also a bride i'm also feminine in nature come on but i know the difference and my god knows the difference but the world's god don't know the difference he just tries to mix them all together but yes i am bride so i am feminist in that part but i'm also a man a human man so i'm gonna mess it up you better not mess it up either so there's a part of the renewing of your mind we keep it's like sister regina and i were talking about and and and i say this in i guess that's the way i can say it she's talking about being being your mind and your eyes being raped and that's true because you walk out in the world and you see things that just absolutely boggles your brain and you would have never thought that would ever happen ever never thought that would happen and then you're seeing them with your what the the eyes of an outlet to your soul so whatever you see you better have that filter you better have that thing that says whoops that's not right because what it's going to do it's going to go deep down and if it has nothing to stop it it's going to go right down into your soul and it's going to what it's going to send you to hell hell on earth it's already started let them have it though let them have it let god renew my mind that i can throw it through that filter come wipe me put it in that filter and kick it out let god kick it out because we're humans we have a human nature we have thoughts we have ideas we have all these different things but we have a soul to make a choice and right here he says i'll give you a new spirit now that's not the holy spirit because that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit that's giving you a spirit that's different than what it used to be that's in sanctification that's not the new birth i keep harping on that because a lot of people as brother brown says come under a conviction of sanctification god gets where you get rid of all these things and you start coming to church and you start reading your bible but unless you're born again you're just put aside for service you're not put in service all right i want god to put me in service you need that's what we want to do as the bride as a body i want to be in service i don't want to be a statue i want to be a stature all right a statue is it doesn't move i want to move for god those songs that brother christian that moved me now the world would probably look at it and go what are you talking about but we as christians we we feed on that just like they feed on their music we feed on ours and it feeds our soul it gives a calming it gives us it gives us something to draw on amen because that is a ministry to get the people to see that god loves you god cares about you god's there for you in song as i said the other day look at what happened to saul saul was vexed by evil spirits he was walking through the through the castle one day and he said hmm that sounds good he walks in there and there's david playing the harp singing the songs to god you know what the bible said from then on he would call david in now david was his enemy he didn't like david but he would call david in to play music to what to push to drive those evil spirits out maybe we need to start singing some good christian songs maybe it'll drive some of these spirits we got away so i'll spit my spin just just to talk i'll put my spirit in him but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your what nature nature a little more gentle and settle down or he can't even live with you the baptism of my holy ghost do it holy ghost then though is when god puts his spirit inside of you he puts the love of god something that no one in this world can ever ever replace is agape love filial love can be replaced daily amen that's why i said many times famous bleeding not with god he's a just god and like i said before if he loves you now he loves you then he loves you now he'll love you forever amen seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit of the unfainted love of the brethren that's why under sanctification the prophet of god tells us he said he said you're put in a religious order you start you start doing religious things you start going to church reading your bible that's in sanctification not the new birth that's in sanctification you start doing things different you start going i'm not going there anymore i'm not doing this what's that doing that's driving those unclean spirits out amen but now remember if you wait long enough though and you quit going to church and you quit reading your bible after a while and you quit doing this guess what's going to happen that heads you got built around you god's going to say i don't think you really believe me so he let some evil spirits come right back in and makes you really religious still come still come to church but just every once in a while now anyway seeing you have purified your soul and obeying the truth through the spirit under what unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible what is the incorruptable seed the word of god god doesn't have i'm just going to say it god doesn't have sperm he's not a god that way he doesn't have to have sex to make anything so his what the spoken word is the original seed his seed is in him from his mouth not from his loins that's the problem we have we got born the wrong way from earth the loins of adam and eve not from the spoken word of god which is the seed of god which is the word of god and you weren't born with the word of god inside of you or you just being an instant christian and god wouldn't have to die you wouldn't have to have the bible to tell you what's right and what's wrong that's why i said thank god i got lost but thank god i got found amen for whom he did for no he also did predestinate we're talking about this morning for knowledge is first uh for knowledge for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among mainly brethren let me try to explain it this way god in his infinite mind he and thank god that i was thinking about last night brother branham tells us in christ the mystery god revealed he said let's go back in the back part of god's mind nobody's ever been there before nobody it took a prophet to walk us into the mind of god but you know what i just said the key he walked us into the mind of god he did not say i'm going into the mind of god and i'm going to get this and i'm going to bring it out and tell you he said let's go back in the back part of god's mind let's let's go back so now we see what he sees and while we were in there we got revelation just like he got revelation so that we can say these things that we say term listen we've got terminology the world don't know nothing about denominations don't know nothing about that's our terminologies new birth oh it's just believing mama was good like daddy said pave the parking lot you're going to heaven that's your new birth out in the world not now not here we know better who me before it did to what to be foreign to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren see we have to conform to him the problem is we want him to conform to us and allow us to do the human things that are not right no ain't gonna happen in my georgia english ain't gonna happen you may not say that in ohio but you understand what i said more more over whom he did predestinate then he called called and saw what you would do when he called and whom he called then he also justified he's not going to justify you if you don't want to be and whom he justified them he also glorified amen so what can we say to these things i didn't put that down but what did we say if god be for us who can be against us romans 11 verse 2 said god had not cast away his people which he foreknew what though he fought he didn't afford he just didn't foreknow donnie fall bush by donnie fall but his name he foreknew brother donnie because he knew what brother donnie would do when he got here so by his foreknowledge he knew what you would want it's still all free moral agency every person even the devil is a free mortal agent amen lucifer i created you perfect you walked among the fire of god you walked in heaven you walked in eden until iniquity was found in your heart satan made a choice even he listen if he had a choice then i'll promise you you and me got one you know what god made a choice really yeah he's god he didn't need anybody he needed nothing to exist but he wanted to because he wanted to have children all right let's keep going predestinated let's go down here and whom also you trusted look the bible says after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise so there's a what there's a work in progress wip work in progress we are working towards something all right what which is the earnest of your inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession which is this guy unto the praise of his glory john 14 25 said these things have i spoken to you being yet present but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he's going to come back in other words and teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you acts 1 verse 4 this is jesus speaking but you shall receive power after look at all those afters as we were talking about this morning after that the holy ghost has come upon you you will receive power before that you're powerless and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria utter most parts of the earth which is that word is dunamis with power which is inherent power power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature see that's why we have to have a nature change listen we didn't get a soul change your soul is you amen and you didn't have two souls one i like what brother dale said one time if you all remember this he said it's really hard to preach false doctrine because you got to make all this explanation the truth is truth but you guys you got there's georgia english explaining you guys playing this away and explaining this away and explaining this away you got you guys playing the way you guys playing god completely away if you want to believe you got two souls or you had this great something inside of you when you were born no thank you i had a soul that was rotten i had a soul that was hey listen it was given by god perfect just like satan he didn't create satan satan he created satan and satan became by choice he became evil amen you and i before the age of accountability thank god we had a prophet everybody believe god sent a prophet right okay same group all right so as a baby when you're born in this world you're perfect your soul is perfect but look it doesn't know right from wrong it's a baby can't make a choice so therefore god made a provision somewhere they said i know you're going to be a baby and i'm going to send you to heaven until you get to the age where you can decide which what you want to do because all babies go to heaven it's a prophecy god said but now what is the age of accountability you can argue all you want to it's when you know right from wrong like i said before put two put a five-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl in the bathtub they'll play all day don't put them same ones in there ten years later big difference same two people what but they've come to a knowledge of the truth they've come to a knowledge of who they are same way and that's the same way with us as a baby you're going to make mistakes you're going to fall you're going to you gotta you smile like a baby but now when you become about 16 years old stop acting like a baby you're not 16 yet are you oh good grief okay thank you but grow up how many times grow up don't smile brother michael grow up but that's what god's saying right now though but to grow up you got to go to school some of us go to school of life amen we tried that yeah we tried that got the hard knocks let's try to renew our mind and come over on this side though now i never said it was going to be easy but you'll know how to what i say before numer new birth will not take away your problems but it will help you deal with them more than this world this world they have to deal with it by drugs and pills and alcohol and all this different stuff we come to the word of god we come to the word of god we come and listen to a good holy ghost-filled preacher our teacher his brother bob different ones we you if we fill ourself with that whatever you fill yourself up with that's what you're going to be amen those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of that group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it now that's where we're at today all right we are sitting in this room because of a message that came from a messenger and i hope to god we believe it and i hope to god we live it yes because we're the only people that's going to live this message nobody else can live it but me and you simon peter servant the apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ matthew 12 says i say unto you every idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment listen if you don't get it out now you're going to have to give an account there amen some men's sins go before some go after everybody with me you better be a forgiving person and ask for forgiveness every day of your life for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned thou shalt confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made under salvation confession is to admit or declare oneself guilt of what one is accused of that's what's so strange i love this you got a man sitting on you got a man sitting on the throne the judge the attorney and the jury all in one man amen he's sitting on the throne making an intercession for you because you know what the accuser the devil is there every day he shows up for court every day he's got a full docket you see what they're doing you see what that was doing over there the attorney says wait i'm sorry the attorney jumps up and says i didn't see it the jury we didn't see it the judge says he didn't do it and the devil's still going yeah but he well okay we didn't see it don't have any witnesses we can't accuse him well he didn't do it poor devil but now listen he can get an audience with god because he's the accuser of the brethren but remember in the book of revelations oh come on people in the book of revelations he's cast out he's cast out of heaven you know why because we're going to be there we don't have to anymore deal with that dude [Applause] oh he's every day oh you see that i see what that one did you see what that would do i didn't see it i didn't see it all i see is blood but when that blood's gone we walk through that blood and we get in this side he's going that way the bible says when we go up he comes down he won't be in our place anymore when we go up he comes down and there'll be no more accusing of us because there'll be nothing to accuse amen boy that ought to make you happy there'll be nothing to accuse because when he stands up off of the throne he's not an intercessor anymore he doesn't need to be what he's intercessing for is in front of him hallelujah we're there but we get a piece of it while we're here thank god that we can say lord forgive me i'm sorry i did that like sister freedom if i've done anything lord clean my slate and the intercessor says didn't see you do it start with and the devil's over going yay dead bring me some witnesses the devil's going just me ass you're a liar aren't you a liar we've already we've already figured out you're a liar so get out of my court but when we but when he stands up in revelation 5 when he stands up and the man takes the book redemption's over so we don't need an accessory anymore we're done intercession work is over now we know he intercedes for the jews we know that but not for the gentiles like i said before when that door of the ark was shut that was it no more the room got smokey the water started coming up amen that's what we're looking for folks that's revelations 5. there was one worthy to take the book well what was the book me and you he took us and said i redeem them i'll handle this only one man can do that confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual ferv prayer of a righteous man or woman sister availeth much to possess is to acquire get or procure a thing for oneself in other words a possession that's my possession this is my computer all right it's not yours it's mine possessed now look every one of you should know how what how to possess his vessel as we're going to talk about that a little bit later not tonight not today but when we get back every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor what is sanctification clean and set aside for service even after the new birth there's a daily sanctification where you have to say god forgive me i'm sorry for what i did i'm sorry i did this i'm sorry i did that lord let me read your word of god instead of reading whatever true love magazine whatever do the things of god if we'll do the things of god like i'd read that quote right here he has got to bless you god is obligated to give us those things which we desire if we come with the right attitude and we look at the promise of god and say god i know you're going to do this christian he was telling us a story the other night last night his mother didn't have two pennies to rub together hey man and an old naysayer right here yeah that's right he said he said mama you said we don't have any food to eat that's right son but mama you just paid your tithe you give us the light you give up right the last bit of money we had how many of you willing to do that i hope you are because i am right but he was going the old naysayer playing the part of the devil sorry he played the part you weren't the devil played a part of the devil crystal don't laugh a little devil but but anyway so he says mama why did you do that that was at last you were what 14 15 years old yeah about 14 15 years old okay so he's a little smart out so anyway um you were too don't laugh um so he says mama why why did you do that she said i pay my tithe how long how long after that event two hours after that event a neighbor comes knocking on the door [Music] with two bags of groceries two bags of groceries that said here the lord imposed on me or impressed on me that you needed something to eat now he told me and he was uh he's a liar if he didn't he said now buddy i promise you you pay your tithes that's what will happen two bags of groceries just from my neighbor that you've probably seen a hundred times but one day you stood for god and he stood for them two big old bags why not he hey look i don't believe he came i said here's y'all something dude no i bet he was going big old brown bags he said of groceries and they ate on that until they could get to the next paycheck or the next little bit of money widows might folks what did jesus tell that guy that woman gave off and she'll have a place in heaven i don't care what you're giving you're just giving you a little low 10 you keeping 90 and you heaping gifts on your own self promises of god and a testimony right here among us that it works now we all got that testimony how many of you have done that i mean maybe not that drastic but you paint listen that tie check goes first go first first thing you don't and don't try to figure out how to cheat god if you make a thousand dollars a week write him a hundred dollar check forget the rest but everybody's going no i think i'll take off for this and i had a couple ice creams the other day oh i bought two gallons of ice cream yeah i'll take that pay you a hundred dollars and forget it watch god stand on his promise if you stand on his he'll stand on his own promise and he'll give you a couple of bags of groceries amen what a boy tell me thank you i was gonna say if sister johnny was here she'd say what a mighty god we serve man what is sin unbelief well now see we become believers we believe in tithing we believe in going to church if you don't you're an unbeliever sorry richard roberts i said it again there's only two elements though that controls a human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise it's all about confession you can't do god can't do anything for you until you confess it he can't until you confess is that right for he is the high priest of what your confession i'll confess you before the father remember he'll if you stand for him he'll stand for you you get that young man now he is sitting here to make intercession on my confession and i have a right to confess that he's done anything for me that's in the redemptive blessings that's what we were just talking about there you are all right let's continue on let's get to some of this get where we need to go we talk about the divine power and then look we come to this it says add to your faith add to what all we're building up to out of this all this foundation of listen you're going to believe in something right or the old saying is you'll fall for anything but it's a war we know that because our mind is set on carnality and god is not carnal so there's your two positions and even when you get born again satan just moves out to that next realm of the spirit realm remember reasons constant affection imagination and he sits on your shoulder and he goes okay you're okay go ahead and do that no i got to have faith that god's going to renew my mind i'm not going to do it but you know what i'm going to do i'm going to put myself in a position or a place that god can do it make myself available that he can teach me make myself available that god can do what he said he would do sister um your wife your wife your mother she made herself available what if she did not paid her tithe now hold on what if she did not paid her time and she just took that little bit of money she had and spent it on cigarettes or beer and i mean i'm it's not but see if she did that now that man had never showed up on the door you can say well you don't know yeah i do know because that man was sent from god because you did because it's a reaction to an action right you gotta you gotta make an action for god to react confess to possess so the confession is first you confess that you possess all these virtues you confess that's what the whole thing i'm telling you we've got to confess that virtue is going to be in my life that knowledge is going to be in my life temperance is going to be in my life because your old carnal mind says don't worry about it just come church sit down and sleep now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now we know that without faith is impossible to please god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is in a rewarder reward her sister morales was rewarded she was rewarded because she did something she did what god said therefore look god had to react remember brother brown should call god on the scene right with the right attitude and a reward of them that diligently seek him his lovely mama when i met her the other day brother christian and them on a upholstery shop she was in the front of it she's a little bitty woman but that doll will be the woman she hugged my name she said thank you for taking care of my son i said ma'am i ain't taking care of him god is but you can't be saved without faith faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it it's there but faith so that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon we know that there's a declare there's a faith then there's a declaration even though nothing declares it there's going to be some works that's going to declare your faith okay we'll get to james in just a second now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and it's impossible to please god without faith you cannot please him and if you say you believe god you have never seen him see so then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith all right like i said before when we get to glory and there stands jesus and we're in the millennium i don't have to have faith that god exists i see him with my own eyes but now what do we got to come to though we got to come to this faith and have rapturing faith oh come on somebody we got to have raptured faith that he is here in you and he's already said i am the resurrection and the life and where is that man now he's inside of you i can't well that just stops you right there i can't i don't know um but look moses had a burning bush experience and it anointed the faith that was in him oh it anoints our faith it moves us out that's why listen folks that's why we come to church that's why we listen to different ministers to get different views not different opinions but different views just like the song service today we got different songs we've never seen before and you could just feel that that was pleasing to god you could just feel that that we've never signed that here in this church ever before right a couple of those songs never but all of a sudden though here comes those songs something new something fresh and boy you just pick it it just picks up it picks everything up i hope it did you it didn't me i was sitting back there trying i was gonna run around around the chair for a minute but there's something within us we were predestinated to see this hour and there's nothing gonna stop us from seeing it amen here god has spoke it it's already happened we see it oh how we thank god for this oh then it brings out your faith when you see these things happening here so romans said please don't be conformed by the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then now that part renewal is renovation like i was telling y'all before i had a big old dumpster sit in front of the house the other day and we were renovating part of the house billy gary made us a new deck well you know what he did with the old parts he didn't try to use them not with that one for sure what do you do he threw him in a dumpster why didn't need them anymore unusable but we got new stuff there now we were renewed we have a new porch we can sit on now amen try that with god sometime pull the dumpster out and say god throw in there what i don't need tear it out doesn't matter brother gary wasn't out there going now let me see if i can pull that nail now no zach comes up there with the loader and he grabs it with that loading grapple and go shake shake shake that's the way i want the devil to be done i want god to bring that grappling hook and grab him by the neck and shake him and bounce him on the ground and throw him out amen oh you love your devil a lot more than i do i want that dude to be out when they come and took the garbage off i didn't follow the garbage going hey wait a minute no i said good riddance bye-bye throw it in the seat of god's forgetfulness put it in the landfill never to be remembered again i like where brother aaron said what is it aaron if you haven't used something for seven months or seven if you hadn't used something for seven years you really didn't need it so if you hadn't touched some of your stuff for seven years throw it away all right now if you haven't touched your husband or wife don't do that for seven years you need to you need a renovation a complete change for the better but remember you're contrary to god you are contrary to god you were born contrary to the way god wanted you to come but what's he doing by the renewing of your mind he's telling us now look he honestly is telling us i know i was born in sin shape and iniquity but there is a god saying hey come on i made a way i saw you already make it right here this is you i thought of you before the foundation of the world i saw what you do you just hadn't got to it yet but oh when that piece comes together when that piece snaps together when you're putting a puzzle together you're missing a few pieces in our house or daddy's house that happens a lot you couldn't find a piece look for the piece well we've got all the pieces to the puzzle now folks every piece of the puzzle is there you just gotta find it but how happy is it though come on some of us older people that still put puzzles together some of you don't know what i'm talking about because this ain't a puzzle that's a physical thing called puzzle go to hobby lobby and look back in the back back then way back in the back because nobody ever buys them that mall cars but you go back there the back yeah i used to put them together too they're about 20 something dollars now we just get them for two or three dollars a piece that's horrible anyway so you go to hobby lob and you get this little box and you shake it up and you see this very beautiful picture right but when you open the box what is it a jumbled piece of mess pieces your life but you gotta be have faith though that you can put that piece of puzzle together that god can put that piece together all those pieces what does it take it takes somebody to put them in their poi oh good grief it takes somebody to put it in place it takes somebody to go i see the picture now that flower goes right here oh that's i love it when i find pieces that i hadn't found before me and jim when we used to put piece of puzzle together we'd leave it there for a while because after a while it all just kind of jumbles up together you leave for a while how many times does it happen you walk back and she goes there's a piece that was missing is it laying right there playing with the bible you say no i miss a piece look at the bible there's the peace well i never read that scripture before i've never seen that quote before yeah it's been there the whole time it just wasn't your time that was good i like that thank you lord for giving me that wasn't in my nose have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was need for me to write into you exhorting you exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints now i told you right there's where we stop let me explain the faith of the fathers who does not know what the faith know who knows what the faith of the father is good grief if you do know raise your hand up where i can see it all right i'm fixing to explain it all right so you've got the book of acts right here in my hand everybody with me the book of acts the acts of the believers peter james paul matthias all 12 disciples you've got acts the book of acts right here in peter's shadow people were healed people peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have didn't even touch the person mighty miracles were all through the book of acts and god working in each one in in the people and them coming together and having church and having all things common that was the father's because what had happened was in malachi 3 there was a restoration from the old pentecostal i'd say pentecostal the old testament is everybody with me here's the old testament right here all right moses elijah elisha isaiah in the blank have i got that all right so they're supposed to be turned back to the young the new church john the baptist took him from the old testament everybody with me took them from the old testament and turned them to a new way behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world no more have to go to the you don't have to go to the um holy of holies you don't have to go to one priest here's the man that's going to do it and this is a new church being built how about with me but then that established a faith it was new at the time but they became mature they became fathers older mature and then down through the church ages man started getting involved we'll read in just a minute man started getting involved and started pulling it apart they took the faith of the fathers and pushed it away so malachi 4 is to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children everybody with me all right and then hearts of the children which was pentecost which was malachi 4 two now we were pentecostal babylon babies and god has brought us a message to restore the faith of the fathers which was back there everybody with me so that was what brother brown's message was remember he said this messenger malachi 4 do two things one according to malachi 4 he will restore that faith let's read it right here let's let brother brahm explain it go to the jews he was the son of david to the greeks he was lord to us he's lord to the gentiles and now in the last days he would return back as son of man because malachi promised that there would be a prophet rise up in the last days that would return the hearts of people back to look away from them organizations back to the original word the faith of the fathers in other words what the earth what the christendom was founded on foundation the apostles the prophets jesus christ be the chief cornerstone never with me and when he did it saint john 14 12 the words that he did would be done also revelations 10 promised the whole mystery how are you going to reveal the mystery see what luther left off see what wesley left off see what pentecost left off and reveal the secret of the heart to make it the same god through every age which is nothing but god's word being made manifest what back to the son of man again you've got to restore the faith of the father's back because they were the ones that most of them saw jesus they were under that ministry they had power they weren't cold formal and powerless they had the power of god working in their life but man has come in well let me read right here look for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ they come from the faith of the fathers and they started saying nope it was a trinity no you need to baptize father son holy ghost there is an eternal hell there's a purgatory there's dead saints you need to pray to you see how they're eroding the word of god they're tearing apart so they're look the word is all powerful but when you get in your mind listen to me when you get in your mind a thought contrary to god it dilutes the word of god everybody with me it turns it into lasciviousness i read that to you it turns it into what powerless but thank god he sent a malachi 4. he sent one to restore and bring all the gifts bring all the loose ends all the revelation that was lost down through the ages he brought us back to the faith of the fathers amen and i can see it i've seen it you've seen it we've all seen it in our life this message is not cold former and powerless i don't care if you sit with your arms fold you don't say a man one time there's got to be something inside of you that says amen if not then you need to get born again because there's a quickening power to this message there's a quickening power that ought to be quicker than you now and you ought to be saying ain't nothing but the truth ain't nothing but true they ain't nothing but truth ain't nothing but truth and when he did saint john 14 the words that he did would you was done also revelations 10 promised the whole mystery how are you going to reveal the mystery see what luther left off all right what was luther trinitarian god can't bless once light comes once light comes cannot bless a trinitarian doctrine everybody with me he can wink into their ignorance and say well that's man but i'm going to have a bride over here that's gonna be restored back past luther back over into paul's day brother brown said did paul make it the angel said yeah he made it he said i'll make it because i preach the same thing paul priest that identified that he brought back the faith of the fathers and he preached his heart out but like i said before did he change the denomination nope they just kept making more did he change the people naughty kept they just kept cutting their hair not coming to church until god strikes your heart you can't live this message until god gives you the new birth there's no way you can live this message it's a struggle but you can live it because it's not the message it's the bible that's what i don't understand people will leave this message and they start cutting their hair and painting their face and drinking beer well listen that didn't do away with the bible talk so let's say you live holy the bible told you to live holy before william brown got here and a christian back in the faith of the father's days you don't have to worry about that but luther look look how diluted he got even luther being a church age messenger drink beer mocha pie talk about god in a pub that's how diluted it got but you know what god said i'll take that right now because you know what i got to keep moving i can't skip i got to keep moving so i moved through luther i moved through wesley i moved through pentecost guess what he's moving through us right now your genuine faith will do it right there your genuine faith will make it so real to you look at that woman with the blood issue she said if i can only touch the board of his garment i'll be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issue had stopped she actually believed it and when she touched it to prove that it stopped jesus turned around and said who touched me that perfect face and look and that same perfect faith tonight tonight will touch jesus christ just as it did back then the woman came with a perfect faith for that time perfect faith said look now notice another perfect faith that we were talking about this last sunday perfect faith is a master of all circumstances you heard it brother brown said it this morning or this afternoon one he said i take every spirit in this room into my control i can't i'm not gonna do that because some of y'all and me brought some bad ones in here and i don't want but he did but faith masters everything because you know what he had a commission he had an angel tell him say get the people to believe you and said nothing will stand in your way not even cancer so if if brother brown is looking out and he sees demons he's looking at another dimension he sees demons he's not scared of them he never said from the pulpit well i'm not going to deal with that one that looks real bad over there no jesus didn't either the disciples were afraid of a couple remember right oh you can't read that in the bible but they couldn't cast that devil out so what was the problem they were the problem jesus said oh that only comes out by fasting in prayer how many times you heard brother brown say okay now he would he would discern he would cast out this that this devil that devil but remember when he came to epilepsy watch him when he comes to epilepsy he says okay everybody bow your head and close your eyes why because the eyes is the inlet to the soul and when that he said when that demon leaves it's going somewhere and if you've got your head bound in reverence you're not gonna get it but if you turn the look at it it's coming right towards you i'm telling you what profit what the brother what brother abraham says that's what he said but perfect faith masters all circumstances jesus never got frustrated brother adam got frustrated at himself sure enough but when he stood in that pulpit and he had that commission from god he was not nervous hey man just like the maniac over in wherever the organ or somewhere that was going to kill him break him apart he said he said you'll fall at my feet he didn't start stumbling back he stood his ground because he knew what god would do what are you and me going to start doing them we stumble back at every devil there is even the little ones when are we going to stand up and say look god gave me a promise god gave me my kids god gave me my husband gave me my wife gave me my joy gave me my peace am i hitting somebody yet that don't have one thing to do with it it masters the circumstance in a room of sickness the lord revealed that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and go on just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going then we talked about paul and daniel paul when he was on that ship right he was on a ship god told him said you got to go to rome now you said you got to go to rome so you go into rome right so god said so so he gets on a boat so the boat's going into the ocean and all of a sudden this big storm comes up well that wasn't god that was the devil he was trying to disrupt the plan of god hello somebody he was trying to disrupt your plan of god the plan of god for you he was trying to disrupt so he sent this big storm but before the storm god had a prophet sitting in the boat and paul stands up and says hey wait a minute now look there was 200 and some people on the boat now think about it this thing this is not a this is not a cabin cruiser with water and a refrigerator and no this was just a boat a wood boat with 200 and something seasoned people on it that knew the water knew the waves knew what was going on they said we're losing this thing we got to get off paul stood up and he said look if you'll stay on this boat we're going to lose the boat but we won't lose one person if you'll stay right here and boy it was hard talk about a renewing of your mind everything those sailors had been talked was get out of that boat because it's fixing to break apart get in the lifeboat but remember what the captain did the captain said okay we're going to believe what he said he said you cut they were getting rid of the lord the lifeboats he said cut them things off i want somebody a captain to stand up one day and tell me say look do what that prophet said believe what he said stand there i don't care i got all these issues i got all these things over here i don't care let's do what the prophet said did they lose one hmm not a one it was a miracle because that thing broke apart 200 and some people in the ocean said some of them were floating a wood some of them probably swam in but you know what they started counting them do you know they were getting ready to kill the prisoners you know that's what you do when you have a shipwreck if you have prisoners on your boat do you know they have these in prison now they have a gas chamber if something happens like an earthquake or some disaster they run them in there and they gas them and kill them everyone yeah there's one in every major prison because i mean what if what happened if a wall falls down you got 150 to 200 or 3 000 murderers running out in the street but that's what they were going to do they were going to keep paul says hold it believe what i said praise god even the prisoners got saved hallelujah this prisoner got saved the devil would have killed you he had destroyed you and he's still trying to do it but oh i had a prophet say no stay right there stay on my boat stay in the message believe what i said and you'll be saved and they were saved all 200 and some of them but paul comes up to a place and the natives on the on the island they're like well this is kind of strange 200 and some people here they are swimming up on our island you know and we don't that storm was rough it should have killed them everyone no they everyone got saved but they started taking care of paul they said well paul was you know jonah was the problem remember so they threw him overboard so paul must have been the problem the bible says that they called said well he must be a murderer is because all this bad stuff's happening you know why the bad stuff happened so that the good stuff could happen the bad stuff happened so that the good stuff can happen because here's paul they're calling him a devil they're calling him a murderer well he he they're going they're going to get rid of this guy because he's just uh he caused all this because they probably rallied around paul and they probably were patting him on the back saying hey man thank you thank you for saving my life i'm gonna pat brother branham on the back say look not for saving my soul for saving my life the life that i now live paul said i live by the faith of the son of god here's paul picking up sticks you know what paul's a servant paul didn't sit down on the rock and say hey buddy how about going over and getting me some wood i'm cold go over and get me a new car go over and get me this no paul went over and said i'm cold i think i'll make me a fire so he starts picking up sticks and as he was picking up sticks a snake and the bible said it latched on to him not just bit him it lashed well he took that thing and probably went like this and looked at it and he just slung it out of the way and then mo natives are going he gonna die now god's got our gods that said god's in the bible god's glds our gods are now going to get revenge on this guy because he's such an evil person he's a murderer he's this and that the other paul throws and slings that thing off and as i said before the bible and brother brown said faith masters all circumstances what happened to that poison within three minutes he should have been dead foaming at the mouth and doing all this you know he goes right on keeps picking up wood sets him down builds a fire and the natives are going well we thought he was a murderer now we're gonna make him one of our gods so he got elevated from a murderer to a god but what faith mastered that circumstance it turned that water into wine oh come on it turned that what it turned that poison into nothing faith masters all circumstances daniel in the lion's den same way brother carl they were getting ready we're going to let him down because daniel did what he stood for the word of god not what man said he stood for the word of god and god will stand for you those lines must have been hungry i bet you about three or four days they hadn't fed those lines and they were just going he's mine when they lowered him down something overcame the lines of faith for the time that mastered listen they weren't just one line in there they were several and they were getting ready to tear this guy into pieces and the next day the old king goes daniel he wasn't believing he figured daniel was already chop liver for the lions daniel daniel said hey these things are really nice you ought to have some of these in your palace they were purring like kittens why because he had faith he had faith in what god already said so when are we going to take the bible look faith for divine healing we talked about this so we'll go through it a little bit faster miracles faith for miracles miracle is instant divine healing faith could take months john ryan it could take weeks it could take a long time but you got to hold on to faith then we got to have a resurrection faith we'll talk about these a little bit later and we've got to have rapturing faith all right now look at this god's commission to moses watch this we've got to have faith for the little things first before the great things so that's why you got faith down here at the bottom to build your house on to build your to have a good solid foundation believe what god said all right everybody with me watch this right here james 1 verse 2. let's get to this just for a minute my brother encountered all joy come on james good grief come on man count it all joy when you fall into many temptations how many of us do that we don't like to go through trial we're human that's our mind over on this side but god is trying to renew our mind that the trying of our faith bringeth patience knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing number 13. let's keep going down through a little bit further faith is the substance of things hoped for our brother around this is in the uh god hiding himself in simplicity right before he preached to seals what he said look and faith takes his final resting place on the word of god nothing else not shifting his sands not your opinion not your idea faith takes his final resting place on the word of god that's why i said before i don't want i don't want man's ideas i want the word of god all right but now listen i'm going to say this real gentle there are people that would take a quote from brother branham over the bible seen it 100 times give me the bible this quote will match the bible if you got the holy ghost if you're a mature christian these will match there's never a time when they won't match if he was a word prophet you got to just have patience brother brown said if there's a bible question god will put somebody in the pulpit to answer that question for you there's got to be a bible answer amen that's where it finds this resting place you understand its resting place is on god's word james 2 verse 14 what did it profit my brethren do a man say he have faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say to them depart in peace now you got to watch this scripture i'm going to explain it to you you got to watch the scripture with james and one of you saying to him depart in peace be you warmed and filled that sounds nice but he didn't give him anything be you warmed and filled oh you're gonna make it notwithstanding you gave them not those things which are needful to the body you just said oh everything will be all right just go on everything will be fine everything be good go on no give me something give me something to sustain myself give me a preacher and a pulpit give me a t-shirt give me a good friend a good christian friend that'll give me something besides oh everything will be all right well you why would you woo we all got problems oh lordy i hope we all don't have problems like that look and one of them says depart in peace be warmed and filled joel osteen doesn't preach on sin anymore so be you filled your christians live a good life make lots of money give it to me so i could be a millionaire and buy me a bigger plane so i can get to my believers that was jesse duplantis and you know what people give it to him why because there's an anointing there they think that they're giving it to god when they're really giving it to a man but right here that says notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yea a man may say now look let me tell you something all right you got william branham he gets this commission he goes out to the world he tells them i got this commission angel met me in 1947 the day after uh israel became independent he gets it nails it to the day and he gave me a commission to go into the world he said you'll be before kings potentates you'll take this message to the world i said you'll have a healing ministry i said nothing will stand for me in front of you not even cancer so he declared that right now what if that didn't happen but what if the first sermon he preached and calls the prayer line and nobody gets healed and he gets scared of that cancer demon and he does all the things contrary to that testimony that we could consider him a false prophet and put him over here where he's supposed to be but what did god do from the get-go from the gate he declares this is my prophet this man has divine heat the gift of divine healing this man was going to tell you how in the world listen the people back then they didn't have all the uh medical stuff we have now with like uh sonograms and and all they had was x-ray right but now we have mris all those different things that can splash your body in half what is that called ct scan see if you got any cats cat scan you didn't have any cats they did find a brain though okay oh it disappeared let's pray for sister freedom but now look what they have and all brother branham was was superficial outside cancer on them you know you oh i know your arm no deep down inside they really didn't know if an x-ray didn't show it remember he said it can hide remember many times he said satan you thought you could hide this from me why brother brown was looking he was a ct scan he was scanning your body one inch after the other and he said oh it's on your left breast or oh you've got a cancer on your liver how in the world did he know that he was looking at it to an x-ray he had x-ray vision so that built the people's faith get the people to believe you get the people to believe you so he showed what faith he had by the works that he'd done he proved who he was i don't care you can say whatever you want to about william branham he proved who he was in his own tape it's on tape he proved who he was oh he he proved who he was tell me one time he ever to say he ever said on the tape oops i didn't mean to say that you remember that one time where they and they always had the critics you saw him on there a minute ago he said i'm up against something there was people that weren't believing what was going on in the service but remember he called that woman out he said oh you live at 214 grove street and you're healed then later on brother ryan said that man said she don't live at 214 gross street she lives at 417 farrell avenue brother brown said well she talked to the woman he talked to the woman and a woman said well i moved just the other day i moved so you know what god moved with her that man was still over going i don't believe but he just showed him that he moved she moved she didn't have to tell that guy she moved but you know what god knew she moved and threw a prophet he had he had to speak that he couldn't speak that old address that's not what she's living at so show me thy faith without my works and i'll show thee my faith by my works thou believers that there is one god that does well the devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead if we keep saying i got faith if abraham would have said i got faith i got faith i got faith and he had died with no kids he didn't have that faith but the works came behind it he said i i got faith he said whatever that god says that's what's going to happen was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see us thou have faith wrought with his works and see by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god listen folks we're not the friend of god abraham was a friend of god because he's not a son of god hello he was not born again you and i are the children of god we're not friends of god we're the children of god if you're born again you're a child and son and daughter of god abraham doesn't have that title you do you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the heart that justified by works when she had received the messengers and sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also listen to this we'll be done right here john expressed his faith in what god had revealed to him therefore works is faith testimony watch this when they see you acting like you're healed then you'll know you've got faith that you are healed what does testimony say saying this i have it now because i received god's promise it is now working in me i am making ready for it to happen uh-huh see that's what you t your works does well sure now listen there's only two channels that you can live by one's faith and the other one's unbelief we've talked about that this morning smoking drinking commitment adultery lying stealing carnal impersonations those things are attributes of unbelief if you was a believer you wouldn't do those things no you do that because you're not a believer but by your fruits you'll be known your actions speak louder than what your confession proves hello somebody when you disbelieve god's word and count it as something gone by that's why i said before first time people get in trouble what do you do leave church that's contrary to god's word he cannot give you a problem there's no promise in the bible that says if you run away from god he'll come looking for you he said if you draw nine to me i'll draw nine to you this is just as good as that it goes to show you're not a believer that's right you're not and if you was then you would believe god's word he would express himself he would express himself through his word now he was god's word expressed now if you can't believe me believe the words that i do search the scriptures for them them you have eternal life that's the very thing that will tell you who i am now let me get this real quick and then we'll close right here musicians get ready to come and let me take a little further will you the scriptures is what tells what you are even if you're a sinner the scripture tells you who you are that expresses you and expresses me the scriptures tell what we are it's so loud that our voice cannot even be heard our life speaks louder than our voice and it's god's way of letting us see what we are it's god's way of letting us see what we are let me read one more musicians come on we know jesus lives in a world of perfect faith i want to read this right here though talk about on the chart there's two elements you know that you possess in one of the other let's stand our feet what a beautiful picture of faith faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is no things to be brought faith creates faith takes doubt away faith takes negative and makes it positive how beautiful the old man had a basis he's talking about you know he's talking about simeon remember simeon the lord spoke to simeon and said you'll not die until you see the lord's christ how many of us believe that we're not going to die until we see a body change all right well we need to start confessing that doesn't matter how old you get because simeon was an old man he had a basis for faith faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolute fundamental result that happens in a person's heart that could have been said no better when faith is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart but it can't be based on well go touch a tree you'll get well or pray to the post it's got to have a foundation now here it is i want you to get it how much more foundation could you place your faith on any level than the word of god what more could you put faith in when he said heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall not or never pass away wow faith does the rest of it faith does the rest so you must have faith for a foundation all christianity all that you are all that you ever will be is based on faith in the word of god that's the reason i believe the word first you must be born again and then add to your faith god bless you let's sing a [Music] song lord i cry to jesus [Music] till jesus [Music] in their life and then their christian wall lord it'll help the lord to raise yourself up lord that they can take what this world gives father that's what you said pastors [Music] he is in the name foreign the lord we ask these things lord whoever it is send it to them
