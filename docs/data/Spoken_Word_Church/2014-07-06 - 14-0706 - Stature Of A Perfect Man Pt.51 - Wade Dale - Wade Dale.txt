TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a moment Lord bless you good morning good morning good to have milk back everybody keep me um Brother Rice and cabbage little baby in my prayer a large one he'll do he's a Healer the body's just got to come under suggestion of what we believe so it has good We Believe brotherly kindness let's read first second Peter 1. according to as his divine power hath given unto us all things that repenteth unto life and regardless through the knowledge of him that has called us the glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises by these he might be Protectors of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust besides this besides your born-again experience if all diligence and to your faith verse you in the verse your knowledge on this Temperance patience patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall need to be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see it far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins and we were kind of mentioning this last night with that brother Ramsey uh you didn't lose the salvation but he did lose his inheritance as far as going on in a statue of a perfect man or as far as going on with God he said I'm not going to do this anymore I'm I'm gonna go get him some beer and I'm gonna go drink and he just got an evil spirit on him I was looking while we were talking about that uh brother Brown said he had a critical spirit one time on him and he was asking people to pray to get it off of a prophet critical spirit he told Brother Charlie who did fear well so did Brother Brown I've got the quotes right here brother random said I have a critical spirit and I'm praying that God will get it off okay so just look up critical spirit it's only about eight quotes and all of them are pretty much him talking about himself having a crazy spirit oh sure sees all the wrong a prophet condemns to the ones that won't listen now he's salvation to the ones that listen but he condemns the ones that don't listen so he it was actually God condemning because really what he was doing was he was he was wondering why people just didn't see the light and he was you know at being very critical about how the women dressed and how preachers conducted their stuff he had been he had a very critical spirit he said and that was in 1954 I think it was and then he was still talking about it in 1957 I think I'm not gonna go back to it but but you got to remember one thing once you get born again that doesn't you're not immune from the devil right you're not immune from his tactics and his actions and his ways and you're not immune from a spirit getting on it we all get spared right I don't know about you but I do you get a critical spirit or or one and you know sometimes you just don't care and okay and that was that brother Ramsey he just didn't care anymore he probably they don't tell him what he went to because brother round never said he went through thus and so he was just having a hard time and he got a spirit on him then he just didn't care anymore wasn't no preach anymore but he said the man was saved because I read that last night bible study brother random knew he was saved but God shortened his life because of his actions all right so my quote to you is is to live a long life do these virtues because somebody's got to be perfected and you can't you can't die right if you go on to perfection that's the destruction of death okay but if you say well I I just can't love my neighbors myself well you know what you're going to die and you're going to go by the grave you're not going to take a change that's good you're just not you're going to agree Temperance patience all these things you're going to a grave if you do not have these virtues working in your life but continue to go on to the Capstone of love so brotherly kindness like I said it's a hard one it's really hard to love somebody that hates you it's not hard to love somebody love you right that's easy it's just real easy for me to love her you know and but now somebody else that rubs against you and goes against you it's hard to love them too right okay I was thinking the same thing what you whale I wasn't thinking about you hate me Lord it was the woman you did Lord used to be a long time when we go out we're ready to quote last weekend as a neighbor when he was on the farm and somebody got sick we'd go up and cut it going cut wood bring it in nowadays you you don't even know your neighbor's dead unless you read it in the paper now this was back in 1955. what about now brotherly love has ceased it's awful then he then he condemned his wife for going downtown he said how you do sister Branham I looked over at Mita and I said well you didn't speak to that woman she said yes I did and I said well I didn't hear you she said I smiled oh that little old silly grin that's not and that's kind of a dish on her really he knew that she gave that really silly grant that she really didn't mean what she's talking about that old fake grin oh that little silly old grand old silly green that's not speaking to anybody get out there on the street and shake her hand and say hello sister I'm glad to meet you Amen brother that's what get back to the old-fashioned Ewing line again where men are Christians we're Christians and men and women live like they ought to now look right he's he says right here now we are facing the day that went is prophesied to us that brother love will become a strange thing among people all right well now that comes from Matthew we're going to read it here in Matthew 24. remember this is the this is God talking telling the disciples they ask you the three questions what would the end be when's his son of this coming and something about the temple We're Not Gonna don't worry about that right now Jesus taught us then Jesus begins to tell us take heed that no man deceive you okay he starts telling them what's going to happen and then you look down here in verse 11. many false prophets you arise and shall receive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall why it's cold all right so we're prophesied that that's what's happening but watch what brother Brown says now God's you know Jesus said at the end time the love of me is going to watch Gold Coast remember this is the seal Jesus is preaching the seals to the disciples says it's my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts that there is in God's Bible Satan's tearing it apart if the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight and look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice you can be a great person a great Minister I'll give you a gift to preaching the gospel I give you the gift of teaching a word or I'll give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or any of the fine Gifts of Faith any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them everyone to you but I'm going to withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift I said Lord take all the gifts and let me have the love okay say for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good we talked about that last night except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must have love D so there is your then we look and see that last week we talked about uh now let's find out what Pentecost had to find out what we got lacking so they started out remember what happened in the book of Acts they had all things common now remember Brotherly Love is that today we're going to announce today that Bob is going to be our head overseer tomorrow we're going to the bank and we're going to withdraw all of our money every bit of it not a penny less and we're going to give it to Bob and Bob is going to distribute it as we need it now most of you have already said in your mind I ain't doing that well then you ain't got brotherly luck that's what he said right here because anani since the fire comes up and they were the ones that said okay we gave all but they withheld some money and the Holy Spirit called them out and killed them both or took their life for withholding just a little amount of money that they thought they were giving off because the confession was we gave off all right see if they had not confessed if they had to just come up and said look this is all we can give that's right it'd have been different but they asked and they asked Peter and they said we gave off well the Holy Spirit spoke through Peter and said why have you lied you didn't lie to Peter you lied to the Holy Ghost right so there you see that brotherly love what will happen to you yeah it'll kill you it was the life yeah yeah that's what I'm saying it was the LIE they said we gave off and they didn't if they would have said we gave what we could that's true that's not a lot they gave what they could but now it says in the Bible they gave all all of them they put all their money pulled all their money together and they distribute it and sent people out to do Mission work and stuff like that and now they have to have a lot of confidence in Peter do you think maybe they gave all of them you know they gave all right the gay member let's see they were killed let's see if we can find them now no I meant when it says you don't have to give anything you're not forcing thanks champion foreign all right and the moment verse 32 Acts verse chapter 4 verse 32. and most of them that believe were in one heart and of one soul and neither any of them that that all of the things which he possessed was his own that's right all said this is what we're going to do right neither said any of them that all of the things would be possessed with his own but they had all things coming and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessions of land or houses sold them so what just money they gave everything sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold didn't say they withheld anything and write them down at the Apostle's feet and the distribution was made unto every man according as he had made and Joseph who is by the apostle was surname Barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a leviting of the country of Cyprus having land sold it and he brought the money and later this apocalypse but a certain man mayonnaise with suffering who I stole the possession and kept back part of the price okay his wife also being private to it and brought a certain part and later this Apostle Pete so Peterson and asked why I had Satan feel thine heart the life of the Holy Ghost and keep back part of the price of land while it remained was it not thine own and after it was shown was it not in thine own power why has thou conceived this thing in thy heart thou has not lied unto men but unto God and then he died then his wife comes in and she says the same thing she does I think they sold their houses let's read that one more time let's read that one more time he says they sold their houses it their needs were met as they were needed maybe they rented something for as many as were possessions of lands or houses sold them what part of that do you know yes houses where did they go at night if they sold their own home nobody see what I'm saying distribution was made unto every man accordingly having land sold it and brought some money and later that the Apostle feed even people that have Lane had land listen what I'm trying to say is those apostles Peter James John the ones that were entrusted to do the distribution right they were at brotherly kindness on the pyramid nobody understand that they have the faith of the father when the Holy Ghost fell on the 120 in the upper room they had been tutored by Jesus Jesus had brought them to a place to where when the Holy Ghost fell it not only quickened their soul but it brought all these virtues into their life so that's totally different than what me and you have even that we didn't start that way yeah we started with a new birth as a baby not having a lot of virtue a lot of having knowledge not having tempered patients we had to grow up through the statue of a perfect man they had already been tutored by God himself so when God himself come back and watered or quickened what he had already planted they had brotherly kindness well the brotherly kindness was the problem with me not giving my money to Bob is I've got some kind of issue that I don't even that I don't trust him that's not brotherly kindness if he's got the Holy Ghost and if he's at the Statue of a perfect man that he that Peter and James and John were what I'm saying is those people trusted those men had to do some provision for them to have that much trust yes oh yeah I mean they needed their seller they didn't sell their houses and give it to Peter and them and Peter and them live in a mansion and everybody else has a limited shot because see the communal attitude is where that comes from so man takes it and perverts it and puts everybody in a commune and they have everything coming wives and everything husbands and all that they do all that communal stuff right but the the the way the church was first set up in Jerusalem the foundation of the church were built on is is they trusted those men to take care of what was going on and there was no question because see ananas had a question or he wouldn't give it all and he said why'd you lie I said you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost right right so the Holy Ghost must have been on the scene to provide see that's our problem our problem is and sorry sister Judy the problem is is you don't trust giving your money to somebody else that's the whole thing I don't mind if I had a million dollars I'd give it to Bobby it wouldn't bother me a minute because you had these people that had these people that had not but the people that had not and people that had that game all once they pulled it together they all lived in a defense apartment or whatever you want to say yeah yeah but listen let's don't forget this this is the foundation of the Christian church right I think so whatever was the foundation was it had to be right that's right or the building couldn't have been built on top of it I'm talking about what we're walking I'm talking about what we're walking on right now it's what we're talking about and if we have a problem with what they started then we've got a problem I told you brother kindness is going to be a problem right that's right because it rubs it this the privacy of this man and we should have nothing private and that's right if we got something private we got a problem man and I said something private he had a problem maybe it was just green screen I think what I think maybe not so much greed I think he didn't trust just like white treaty I'm sorry it's just true but it's not you have no trust in who you're giving it to exactly right I think it's uh had something to do with having faith too in God to provide you know well they had faith in those men that were of God right but to do exactly what they're in those men yes yeah because remember Peter said you didn't lie to me yeah right you lied to God that's right but now God wasn't there standing physically it was God in Peter right right see that's what we got again what do we got to get back to and it's not putting all right but it is putting our faith in brother Dale yes exactly my my my income no not my income my income right right my income that's right depends on him now my out goal depends on me that's right but my income depends on him if we don't think that he's of God then we need to get fun you know right like the queen bee we were talking about last night is the queen bee don't perform the other bass killer Mega medal right so you know same thing with this this is the whole thing people I'm telling you this might all stir this all up but remember it didn't Stir It Up but in two people when the church first started and I sensed the fire that's the only two people that's recorded that had a problem with this foundation of the original Christian church and they said we ain't giving off we're keeping some of us right yes that's why I believe that this the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil not the money the love of money is a root of all evil I think talking about brother Dale I think that some people have a problem separating the man yes from in the pulpits from the god in the man right there right and because you're seeing the man and and see that's the problem that's a problem they had in Jesus sure yeah exactly you right yeah I'm playing we see you eat every day we see you hungry we see you go to the bathroom we see you walk you walk around with prostitutes and and druggies and you know you're right he wasn't he the only time he ever got in the temple was to get on the mountain all right really so you look at Jesus and you go she had nothing either and yeah he didn't know a place to lay his head you know so but it was done it's a lot of money is the root of all evil yeah it's not the money it's the love of it because it takes money the loss of the proud of the eye lust in the flesh but that was a try yeah you know they said it right they could give off well that had Paul had in his mind I'm not gonna put these people out on the street I don't I'm gonna provide for them but everybody just give you all and we'll provide for everybody and I think they probably knew that all right well obviously it worked because we're still living off that Foundation yeah you can't get off the foundation right if the foundation was true you got to stay on that Foundation now men have perverted it like I said that the guy down in Athens what's up Z Pike he took the same Bethlehem or whatever that is the place down there it's close to Heaven Monroe but he that was a an idea but he took the people to his South not to God and took his people to the South to himself and they had all things common they had come in and that's why they call it a commune because everything's common so uh uh and then brother Branham preaching the token message in a trailer to that group out in Arizona that uh gold and and all them moved out there and brother Brown said you will never be successful finally went about it the wrong way they were building it on a man not the word of God now this was built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets I'm quoting scripture Jesus Christ being a Chief Cornerstone all right so that Cornerstone will start is that Cornerstone cannot be anything different than the headstone all right or you got two gods until the Cornerstone was and not now that we have to give all of our money brother now but you know what we give them a big part of our income sure we tithe offerings work and all the things we do forward that to the running of the church so it takes money to run to church but these people right here that's where brotherly kindness right right here right here you can read all this the first thing that Pentecost produced was Brotherly Love now that's not 1906 Pentecost that's the original Pentecost it tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a Brotherhood to such a way that they had everything in common in the Bible days in front of it I was teaching them love too I love him well Brotherly Love really is what you call it not really kindness It's Brotherly Love yeah I mean it says really kindness but it is brotherly love and it's love for the brother uh we brother William and I were talking this morning and uh we were talking about you know the sign of the times and all the things coming up he uh he sells things on the internet where they sell some things to these Preppers you know what preppers are preppers are waiting for the end time or waiting for hard times so they're digging bunkers in there and they're storing stuff and and he sold parachute cord and they used parachute cord for many different things for their preparation for the end time but I found there's nowhere in the Bible it says to store up anything except the word of God to not depending on even what you're going to say that's right right right it says you it'll be given to you that's right don't you in other words they send you shut up don't think that's an example same thing right don't speak it'll be given to you you can't build yourself up you can't eat the right food you can't store it because it's a slight grow the women now we're talking heat uh and you'll know it if you have a new car you'll be going down the road an OnStar calls you well that speaker's on yeah I mean they're supposed to cut it on and cut it off but this woman calls you and says it's time for an oil change Mr Dale and you're looking around you know and you wonder where that come from when she's doing it from a satellite which they can leave the microphones only look at now how many video they are how many cameras have you ever looked on a Walmart call them black balls look no look on the outside when you walk into Walmart just look up there's probably 30 cameras that's right cornered in every direction yeah they have them on the streets now even in Gainesville there's there's a lot of cameras so what my point is we can't do enough to try to hide For What from what's coming that's right that's right we cannot do enough to hide from what's coming God's gonna have to do see because if it was anything man what God's doing he's bringing it down to a point where way down don't depend on way down anymore that's right because when when geeza and Elisha we're standing there in that host of 20 something thousand people and Elisha says yeah he's a man there's more of us than they are them and he looks and goes one two one and two you're never gonna get any more than two but what did God what did Elijah say God opened by servant's eyes well he saw Chariots of Fire and angels well they were there the whole time but now what did Elisha do Elisha goes right into that camp of them people and says who are you looking for and they said well we're looking for Elisha he said well come on I'll show you where he's at well it was him God had changed their eyesight to where they didn't know who he was and remember he took him right down in the middle of the Syrian Army and God opened their eyes and they were just defeated they just laid their swords down they just and that's what's going to happen to us we cannot the only thing we can depend on is good enough of those virtues in as to where God can act and it not be us act it'll be God doing the acting not us doing the actor okay you understand what I'm saying because remember Jesus one time they had him back up on a cliff and then we're getting ready to Stony they were going to kill me the Bible says the Bible says he disappeared through the crowd all he done he just changed their eyesight and he just walked right through them and they never saw him but it was him walking in flesh walking right through that crowd and that's the only way that you and I are going to make it is God's gonna have to do it because remember brother Branson you can't make yourself have these virtues that's right you know you've got to but remember there's provision for you to get them and that's come to church reading Bible study pray get with somebody that's got the virtue see that's what I believe Peter James and John and all them they were in one central location but God wanted to get the word out and he knew if this two people over here had their own idea and they go off over here they'll and that's what happened they preach a different Doctrine but God brought everything Central Peter James and John all the ones were ahead of them of the first church Paul was included later but Paul wasn't really included in this yet okay it was Peter James and John because Paul hadn't been converted yet but in that central location God said okay we're going to send you out into these different areas and but you're going to take this gospel and we're going to provide the funds for you to go and that's how it worked because you know what gospel got out somehow but see Jesus though speaking right here at the end of his life on Earth he said to love him anyway it's cold showing that in the beginning of time in the beginning of the Christian church that brotherly the Brotherhood so there and everything in common but now at the end time Satan's going to take all that away or try to take it all away in brotherly kindness Jesus said this this will all man know when you have love one for another one for the other Pentecost had it I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of Apostles and disciples they had that Brotherly Love they wasn't greedy they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church they were so together till even one heard of the other one died and they said let us go and die with it that's the attitude of that first church now listen if it's the attitude of the first church it's got to be the attitude of the last Church can't hold anything different can't hold anything back let's go ahead and go up front that way have some time to get everything ready pray for us doing all the cooking and all and your sisters enjoy
