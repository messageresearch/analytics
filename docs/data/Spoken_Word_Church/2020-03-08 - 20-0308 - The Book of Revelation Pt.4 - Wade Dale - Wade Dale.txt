this morning I always get up to seven on sending I turned over and I'll look dark outside your body says and only sees the clock but now father Tom had to tell us to get up an hour early everything all right so now we've been through it I said thank everybody for for taking over Bob somebody's news next week Nick really because he's sleeping you get hit our back but March the 22nd we're gonna be in Oklahoma probably will get Lily to do do that Center place we're on The Book of Revelations and we're into the church ages we've done one two three and I'm gonna read for again and we're going still we're not gonna go in dive deep into into the Church ages because we know we read the church age book I've asked you to read the separate volumes when brother bang preached them so we ought to have a good idea kind of what's going on because we need to get on into Revelations we're now just in Revelation chapter 2 and there's 20-something chapters so we need to get in and we got to get into all the symbols and all those different things so March the 22nd it's not a way if you hey yeah you get in you're hours late back there okay when you get older you don't want to do that either so here we are in thought IRA now this is the one the fourth circuit if this murder burger was my attire so this is the fourth circuit which is considered the dark ages keep baby I come at the pink and into the Angel of the Church of the anti tire right all right let's get to it guys Tower which is the fourth decade these things st. the Sun God has his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass now remember let's think about this the other day you take you you got to peer on a dull trading word coming in first two three one two three actually maybe not the curb so much but you got you not seeing counseling all these different things the word is really it's like brother Brown said it's just eroded down so much to where they've taken the hope the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism they've taken now there are Pope's in the place of preachers now there it's eroding so bad until God is going to pronounce judgment ice plan to fire his feet brass brass always in the Bible brass speaks of judgment okay all right so I know thy works and charity then we coming to this poor church age and remember like I said before Columba his life was not really in this church age he died before the church they started church age 30 and 606 I think he died like 605 somewhere in there but but his voice of his teachings what he was preaching cuz he was from Ireland he grew up not too far from brother path from for the brother George Queen lives and he was it and I'll tell you one thing you want to read about Columbus never in that we're going to start with a sage Columba brother Trevor even has done a YouTube video and he actually went to Ireland and retraced the steps of Columbus what would you put in on YouTube because I they sent me the link and well it's really interesting how that he shows where he landed the fort that he it was always told that Columba yes you can sit right up here hey girl hey baby funny looking man you see him every Sunday in there I [Laughter] maybe what he it's it's in history it shows that Columba went to this fort to see this King and Trevor was actually standing at the foundation of the gate where the fort actually was so he was standing there talking about that the Kings weren't enough stay with Columba in Christianity so he locked it he locked yeah these other people would say man so the King bard began to clump out in Calamba just walk up to the gate and they said he bowed his head and brains he just put his hand up on the gates of the dangers no but he walks right in and Columbus also use Newton but my point is you think well he was just uh he was a monk he was a monk he was brief and he was as we would think insignificant but not but he was known as the priest that light followed it everywhere he went there was a bright light with always even when he died there was a great light came into the room and then it went out as Mike Trevor was saying Steven the length of dark ages Khalid I'd and then you had a thousand years of persecution by Rome and all the difference all the different factions in the world fighting and and what war with each other so Columbo was many many times that was a light involved with his life he would go in to pray in a chapel and the people would walk by and the whole place would be lit up inside but no maybe one little candle but they would see it from afar off and I said well that's for Columbus in a dream so many different miracles but yeah if you have a chance though and we'll try I know Joe shall need the link on my phone but Trevor iman's he's them he's administering the message in Jeffersonville with defected Nathan right right there you go Nathan Bryan and he actually likes it he went to Ireland and went to the place where Columbus live had a little Church there the fort was there so it's kind of neat how he walked around different things he didn't go very far why did did you you went thing did you go to the fort he went to the fort well then he's all right there I mean Columba didn't live maybe 10 miles square and that's about all he had but his message was so powerful what I'm saying is his life was no powerful the people picked that life up and took it into that for church age being the darkest age dark ages so God's gonna say now so I tell you that he said Columba into Ireland in different places over there to be a testimony but his testimony went worldwide because not only because remember the Christians were being persecuted and remember what the foxes Book of Martyrs was written during that time because Rome started really persecuting the Christians because in 606 they adopted all these different things different and I say things father son Holy Ghost baptism all these different religions are different actually what Catholicism began that there was so much of a protest of it till they would just send people out and just if you're not if you just brother everything you just say the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior they kill you all right because like what the problem yeah Rome would do it but the problem was they were trying to get you to convert to Catholicism which is supposed to been the Lord Jesus Christ but what it was is they wanted you to surf the Pope as the intercessor they wanted you to do them novenas they wanted you to do to this they want you to do that you know all these different things they wanted you to do to get to this Jesus Christ and everybody else is like no I'm saved by grace through faith by the Lord Jesus Christ coming into my life and what happened is this Satan crushed that church age almost call them the dark ages but brother Brown said that was to fulfill part of the scripture where Jesus said a corner weak must fall on the ground if it died by the one so what happened is that the church age came up came up it died in here light almost won out and then it came back up again and we'll talk about that it started as the man I know that works for charity excuse me and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding I have a few things against him because now stuff first that woman Jezebel reading Jezebel religion rather uncommon Jezebel religion didn't begin down here when Jezebel wasn't alive which is way down there in the history of time the genzaburo religion began right in here when they adopted this plate got up into three people they made it where you there wasn't there was hell was eternal there was the purgatory and there was a dis there wasn't that so he said I have something against you because you stuff rest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess now remember she come by a church so this church has inserted their self in their doctrine in the four church a G's McHugh T tends to do service to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not in other words basically he gave her the whole thousand years to repent and she did she the church see the turtles went out and started prostituting herself amen amen behold I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death now what happened is and I will kill her children this is not physical now this is spiritual all right he's spiritually going to kill I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins in the heart no given to every one of you according to your works but unto you I stand unto the rest of time Tyrel as many of them not this doctrine which I've known did not known the depths of Satan himself that church age is so horrible that the doctrine of Jezebel and the depths of Satan but watch what he says I will put upon you none other burden okay like we were talking about last night in the Bible study each person is given a responsibility in an age like Moses we were talking about Moses last night Moses is revelation of his whole life was was to get the children of Israel out of Egypt and get them into a promised land that was his job he's got one ting to build a boat he's job went to be them aside his job wedding to be the fourth church age Mason you're the first of the second of the third he job was to get people of Columbus job was preach the word to the people and God said oh I'm not gonna put any other burden on you you don't have to go around and and be adopted you know not call this is this is the age of adoption not then this is the age of nothing so we're called to it they weren't called to an option they were called just to make it through their church age okay but I say but unto you I say and resultados means have not this doctrine what the doctrine of Jezebel in which I'm not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none of but that which you have already holdfast so whatever they have coming out of the third church age into the fourth Columba being their preacher minister messenger to the church age dude but that would you have already hold fast till I come in other words those martyrs are going to be put away in another dimension they're waiting they're gathered with Columba waiting on you and i right and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's and he shall rule them with a rod of iron remember that Jesus Christ through the people probably as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the morning star people have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches alright now we're going to the remember the fourth church age they had just a little bit of strength they had just enough to get them through the church age all they did was was was profess they were Christians trying to live a Christian life the best they could Rome and the other plate people tried to snuff them out they put him in the they put him in the arenas and and there in Athens Greeks and all the different one they put him on end and you know put the lines out and their leopards and the Tigers and all that remember those story in foxes Book of Martyrs and they were given their life and as they were walking into the arena they were so over you know I mean it was like there weren't being made to go most others had to be dragged and prodded and probably knocked unconscious to get them to go in there but these were going in so willingly that the that the history tells us that some of the Roman soldiers were so convicted they laid their storage down and their shields and they walked right in there with them will they give their life for God that's the true testimony yes that's the true testimony that we want we were talking about last night our yesterday to the young people we want to be such a testimony of that somebody is going to be drawn to you then they'll receive salvation right through you not talking about so much presenting the life that's what they did in their fourth church age they presenting to life to the world now the work of the world that's was so horrible to the world they were kind of you around but in God's plan these people had to be in that age and to have that remember when we were talking about the the lion the Ox the man and the eagle back to the characteristics of the Holy Ghost in the church a lion the ox man and eagle so you got your ops which is why beasts of burden he's slow but man he could pull this you know he can pull this building down if he he had enough um but it was a slope and that's what they were doing in that turkey that is the longest church age it lasted for over a thousand years of persecution a thousand years that supposedly Christendom are this is where Constantine and all the ones come in to develop the Crusaders that put the cross on their backs and said they were Christians if they were killing Christians right and left alright so that was why it's called the Dark Ages but to me it was one of the greatest because of what Columba was a messenger of life but his light all they needed was was just enough light to get through that church age by just saying that I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and I don't need a pope well you know they automatically cook it off but they'll be given I mean they're already sitting in a dimension with eternal life but man they'll be giving this edge right here the table with us they down here at the bottom he that overcometh keeping my work stand him will I give power nation so they're going to be able to rule they've got to meet them roaming people and all the people that put them to death they'll meet them at judgement and they'll say that's what you did you did that so that we can have eternal life alright let's go to number four then to the angel of the church in Sardis Sardis is the second dirt I always use these three interchanges it it's the first church age of the Reformation yeah right did everybody know why we call Protestants and Catholics let me tell you this before we get started you should already know this [Laughter] okay Catholicism started in the fourth the reason I'm saying is this it's gonna help us as we go through this yeah because this is gonna be the Protestant there was no protesting down here you know the degree that they're fixing to be okay so the word products that comes from Hoover protests what did they protest they protested the Catholic Church that's when they called their self Protestants and Catholics that was a division because remember me today there was no denomination anywhere through here now there was denominationally minded people if you have your own idea your denomination T self that there was no named denomination when they come into this page right here it was dominated by Catholicism Roman a truth world so what be Constantine do Constantine and brother Graham tells us this in the church if you reach your finger brother mom tells us Nick that's when church and state comes together Constantine was a poor guy Rome you know he had all the zoo forward all the gods on his side and then he sees that Roman Catholic Church is getting all this money for indulgences and all this money they do and land that they're taking from people and so Constantine says I'm over here starving let's combine these two so that's where brother mount said church and state are a having Jesse Bell FY says in this church age is I have someone against you because you actually let that woman doctrine come into my church but what it was was church and state come together Constantine was supposed to be in a fuel read how many other remember reading about him at school and I remember reading about him in school cuz I did a essay on him and liked eleventh attempt 11th grade and history makes him a great man oh he combined all this together and but what happened was the underlying meaning of the whole thing was is he was a heathen right and there was a Roman Catholic Church in the Roman Catholic churches well we need his power because he's got the big army and all this though and he said we need their gold so I can fund my army with what he does is he brings church and state together he brings Rome as the seat he brings church and state together and then that's what ruled in this thousand year he put crosses on her back and send a mountain they slaughter millions of people foxes Book of Martyrs they slaughter millions of people because of what they believe but now what happens is is when we come out of that age into Luther's age remember the messenger always comes at the end of the age right okay got that we've been taught this river and ever ever even you kids on the lift the Martin Luther didn't come right here at the end of his church age he couldn't do that he came at the end of the Catholic age brother Aaron calls it or the end of Columbus a Martin Luther comes right here why because this right here had been eat down so much what was God gonna do he's gonna have a revival through Martin Luther Martin Luther was actually in this catholic age because he was in the kind of jerk run but what struck him was is all this penance and all these things they trying to do to save their self and there's no way you can do that so God revealed to him one scripture the just shall live by faith that started when he drove those ninety-five theses on the wall and what Umberto River it was that started a protest not to an alley to catch the turn but to protest what they were doing that started if I have read email the Protestant movement which started as Methodist then Lutheran then baptistin than Pentecostal then Wesley ISM and every other ISM it you see from right now today all started because of Martin Luther protesting are coming out of the Catholic Church everybody got that so it was a protest that's why it's called Protestant they protested the Catholic Church y'all remember several years ago when that rabbi when that what was his name Tony anyway of the Catholic priest and he was talking to the Lutheran's and the Westlands and and he said nobody tell me to back off for you he said the Reformation is over or well they're protesting is over why are you protesting we're all one that guy remember he got killed on motorcycles don't let the spirit of will hide and all that coming in the Kenneth Hagin kept hanging a little boy hurt he Kenneth Hagin bowed to him I guess anyway Tony but anyway so that's why you will say it up here in this outrage he's saying the protesting is over why is he saying that well now the Catholics and everybody else are pretty much back just like the says we'll see if a little while later on that that great mother never dies and she has daughters her daughters are sorry to say this but brother Brown tell just Methodist Baptist Pentecostal randomise if you're not warning in all the different things but you and I are still protesting we're still Protestants right because we're protesting every bit of that now we're not worldwide and we're not like this movement was worldwide Luther and Wesley that was a worldwide movement now it's just remember I told you the revival is going to be an individual revival in each person alright just about four more minutes let's begin around here and unto the Church of the angel the church in sardis now this is Martin Luther this is the characteristic that Martin Luther is going to have to carry to get them out of this fourth church age because he comes at the end of the catholic age to the end of the age of thought ira right and brings his message hey he's messy just the starters if i got that okay and into the angel of the church in Sardis write these things says he that hath the seven stars spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know that work that thou has to name that that Olympus that aren't dead now remember in this church age right here when they were coming out of they never denied the name Jesus has always been the savior even to the Roman Catholic even if you go talk to the Pope today they know Jesus Christ as the Saviour but they've inserted that Pope man in the instead of in the place of God so he says here he says I know that without a son named that L liveth and are dead the name begins to come now watch now has a name that they'll live it and aren't dead this is what brother Brown says he says are you a Christian I'm Baptist are you a Christian I'm Methodist that's the man in it and they're dead and you know what they've done they nicely killed the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism during this time because remember before 606 they baptize in the name of Lord Jesus Christ the Christians did they killed it right here and even Martin Luther he baptized in the titles of Father Son Holy Ghost because it wasn't his time he was reforming bringing out through that Reformation he was bringing out the just shall live by faith that's his part is what was evident Moses Moses didn't have to build an ark Moses didn't have to die on the cross Moses had a job well Martin Luther had a job protest the Catholic Church separate yourself and the just shall live by faith that was his message and as we always say Luther listen Luther with the German Germans drink beer like we drink tea especially back then watch my brother Brent say he said he could send the pub drink of beer and smoke a pipe and talk about God what there was just that little bit of heart that he needed he needed to get them people out of the Catholic Church protest what they were doing and then get them into the body of Christ get them back to reading the Bible because what happened was they started to try to compile the Bible in here and they did the Catholic Church would let them doing them they they forbid it but Martin Luther and Tyndale and all those different ones in history they begin to start putting the Bible back together and the Catholic Church hated it they wanted them everybody to just go it's an detergent and excuse me but you know Latin everything was in Latin and you just went to church and you heard the priest and you saw the little boy do this the candle here and the ba-ba-ba-ba-bom and then you went home and you were saved because you the priest read you the word of common land but Martin Luther and even in John Wesley's town they were trying to get the people put the thing in English King James English Bible okay be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God so their works were
