we're going to read from uh psalm 27 verses 1 through 14. amen let's pray heavenly father we are grateful today lord for the privilege and opportunity to come together to worship lord we ask you you will bless each of our hearts father that we will be united lord as one god is this time come satan will destroy us all turn us aside turn us one against another love but your holy word will bind us

light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be though afraid hosts should encounter against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me in this will i be confident for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon the rock he oh lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation my father and my mother teach me the way o lord and lead me in the plain path because of my enemies i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait on the lord be out of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart way i say on the lord god bless you be seated thank you let's turn on 167 167 in spiral on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross we're the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain so i'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last i lay down and exchanges someday for a crown oh that old rugged cross so despised by this old world it has a wondrous attraction for me for the dear lamb of god he left his glory above to bear into dark calvary so i'll i lay down and exchanges someday stained with blood so divine my jesus so i'll cherish and exchanges someday for crime and reproach gladly bears then he'll call me someday to my home not so far away we're his glory forever i lay down and i will cling and exchanges someday for a crime amen isn't that wonderful let's look down at the bottom page across there 170. where could i go to the lord is where could needing a friend to help me and we oh where could i go oh where could i go well life here is oh where could i go where could i go hey man let's look right across to 174 when the saints go marching in a stranger wandering through this world of sin on my way city when the saints go marching in oh when the saints go marching in if my life is go marching in when the saints go marching in lord i know marching in i'm waiting for the chariot to swing low and i'll step in oh lord i know i'll be in that number and think about it is amen amen i don't know i'll be in that number don't you amen the saints go marching in good to see everybody in the house of the lord we had a real good time yesterday at the fellowship meeting enjoyed it a good safe trip over and back i think they wound up being 38 of us which was probably over high for what was there or close but we had a good time fellowshipping together and and all and just riding and and all and had a good time so we appreciate everybody for going and doing and fellowshipping amen brother luis will be on his way back tomorrow yeah well we got to get the time frame he comes in nine something in the morning so i guess he's doing but he's preaching today is that right preaching today well we appreciate that we're glad the lord touched him because he lost his voice and and everything and we just really appreciate the lord being with him and taking care of him man any other announcements we need to make we remember the band quit sweetheart band quit and i'll remember that and just sign up downstairs get everything ready for it and that the lord will take care of all things we appreciate all of it and just pray the lord would bless what we'd like to do if they'll turn the thing the machine around and view on brother gary over there if you want to see a miracle just take a look all right because a few weeks ago he was in very terrible shape and uh i don't try to say a lot of things but just say this uh if he remembers i said uh we're going one day at a time so we talk now and it's what he says we're going one day at a time well see that header little more meaning than just one day at a time because i knew then that he had reached the bottom and he was on the bottom he'll tell you that very very low and very sick and i knew that something had to happen so i had to put it on by faith hallelujah my faith about what i preached all right you see why can't you put your faith on what you believe right try it sometimes i've always tried to tell you a little secret when somebody's preaching and you see it raise your hands and say my family you might find out it'll work you know but i knew then he was going to make a turnaround i wasn't expecting it this quick you know i'm honest i don't worry about you know how long it takes for god to do things we just ask him to do it and he takes care of it so he'll do that and we appreciate god for being so wonderful to us to do that for you know and just you know tell brother gary that you're glad he's back but if you've got a coal or a coffin get away from him okay we're playing don't be foolish and say my coal ain't gonna get to him no we we're just human beings make it right i told him i said put you on a mask and word i said if you want to everybody in the building to put on one. oh we don't worry about it because we believe god's a healer but we're not dumb either we don't go around running down the railroad track and saying well the train ain't going to kill me because god's a deliverer no we do everything in the right order right i'm doing that so all right are you ready for the word are you enjoying the series that our brother's bringing them to us about the stature of a perfect man we appreciate that all right let's sing open the eyes of my heart as white comes to minister the word of the lord remember the sims family my uh brother-in-law passed away as parents who said yesterday and they're having the viewings tonight and things and then the burial tomorrow at pine grove church they're in gillsville uh he was a good brother you know brother-in-law uh just a good baptist christian and all so we pray that the lord will take care of him and that's between him and the lord what he is because we have nothing to do with those things but we know and believe that god is is the savior and deliverer and can do a lot of things if we ask him right open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see him remember brother louise will be traveling back i want why can't you put your life onto what the word said your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy high you love him this morning let's lift him up light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy he love him this morning holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to sing amen you love the lord this morning good to see everybody in the house the lord turn around shake somebody's hand say god bless you thanks for being here good to see you this morning you're gonna spend eternity with that person you just shook hands with so bless you good to be in the house with the lord right everybody feeling good hey man everybody put your prayer cloth over there over your door we sure did we're doing fine so it may just work if you'll do it so i said lord if i get something out there wipe it off when i get through the door let that thing just run down like aaron's you know they poured errands they poured oil all over aaron's head and it ran all the way down to his feet well you know what that was the protection that aaron had he had that protection of that oil running all the way down to his feet there is a type of the holy ghost same way with you and i everybody like that amen everybody see that i like that because that's what we're talking about we're not talking about you or me we're talking about jesus christ he is the centerpiece of the whole thing and then being with the statue of a perfect man it's the centerpiece of the whole of the whole message so uh if you've got your bibles go ahead let's turn to ii peter 1 and read their our scripture as we always do we all had a wonderful time like they said in the fellowship meeting yesterday thanks for the 38 people that overcame and and went with us so and got home safe and everybody's okay today so those of you that scared you might catch something and all of us came back just fine it's going to be here in march so maybe some of you'll be able to come in march the third saturday in march we'll have it here at the at the church so keep that in mind also uh by way of a few more announcements um at road number five down here which is two roads from us there's a rabid cat they have the cat but it's already bit three people three elderly people have been bit and they have been take having to take rabies vaccination shots so it's just not this street or the next one where the next church is but it's the next street over so um tell your children do not play with any cat our dog doesn't matter raccoons or anything else because there is a case of rabies in the community so we pray that each one of you will uh we'll take that in into consideration because we have had those cats running around out here so be careful because they are rabbit i know they took one but now i don't know you don't know how many they've infected so let's just keep also keep the little cats in a prayer that they'll get rid of that stuff because it's not natural for them to have that all right it's something given to them but uh also remember that uh like i said brother luis will be coming back dad said we'll be picking him up tuesday morning lord willing at the airport and uh bringing him home so good to have him back he's uh uh he's done us well over there he's represented the church very well so keeping prayer there also keeping a prayer us going to me going to the philippines i say we and people are thinking that june's going but i mean we in the lord the lord's going and i'm going with him okay so i'm going by myself but i'm not going by myself that's why i say we we are going to the philippines but you know what really we are going we are going i'm taking you to the philippines with me and then maybe as they all say vicariously you can live out the journey of the philippines through me because i'm going to be doing a lot of picture taking and in sending reports we're going to be over there for three weeks so we hope the lord will do something for us when we're when we're there also remember the family will be gone to this afternoon after second service to the uh to the funeral home for my uncle's funeral or for the viewing so second peter 1 verse 1 through 10 also remember that february the 8th i'll be at brother joe green's preaching so keep me in your prayers there and uh exciting year i think it's going to be wonderful if you don't you should have just passed away by january the 1st okay if you're not looking for something good as a christian sure we're looking at all that we'll talk about a little bit about that today and show you something that maybe the lord showed me friday and i hope i can give it to you the way you give it to me you know brother branham always said that but it always happened you know he he got it to the people but they had to accept it and they had to re you know they had to take in and let their holy ghost reflect what brother branham brought and that's the same way with you and i you got to let the holy ghost reflect that's why the holy ghost is the most important thing because if it's not there there's no reflection there's no reflection of the word of god so ii peter 1 verse 10 let's pray dear heavenly father we pray lord that you would be with us today sanctify us for this journey fill us with the holy spirit lord the renewing of our minds today father that we set aside all the things of the world and and let you talk to us father just a little bit be an active participant lord just remove all the doubt and fear and all the frustrations and all the things of the world just for a little while lord that you will sit and listen sit under the tree lord and listen to you speak to us father hear the cool breeze blowing through the leaves and know that it's you lord we ask you blessings on the ones that are sick and not here today that you would heal them father just be with each one the missionaries on the foreign field bless them lord give them fruit for their labor be your brother luis as his journey comes back home bring him home safe father just be with each one bless us lead us in guide us by your love in jesus name amen second peter 1 verse 1 simon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith so it's not for everybody all right but it is for everybody all right i i like what brother brother luke was preaching yesterday you know he was preaching on feast or fast we should be fasting well when we should be feasting we're fasting when we should be feasting we should be feasting on the word of god all right so that's saying we shouldn't feasting on the word of god are those that obtain like precious faith are feasting on the word of god okay because that's what you draw from or that's the strength that you draw from that you've obtained this light precious faith to us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ never forgetting that grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god of jesus our lord according us his divine power hath given unto us all right something we have to we got to obtain because remember you've got to obtain it you got to go get it all right giving us all things that pertains unto life and godliness all right so we're going to start today a little bit more maybe up into virtue and talk about life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby our given unto us it's a gift exceeding great and precious promises but now remember god's not an indian giver when he gives you a gift it's yours amen brother brown said this is my eye god gave it to me so now when god give me the holy ghost it's my holy ghost right that's why we're going to the philippines me and my holy ghost are going to the philippines all right so we're going there so he give it to me it's mine he's not an indian giver or something we said well i'll give you this not give me that back no it's not that way it's a given gift great and precious promises that by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature and what is the divine nature these virtues having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lush and beside this so besides your new birth i'm going to read a quote a quote today that's going to really astound you brother brown says faith alone won't do it right you say boy i got faith is everything yeah it is but brother brown said faith alone won't do it right okay and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and all these temperaments tempers patience patience godliness the godless brother of kindness and the brother kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound overflow they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence look at that word diligence i like that word diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall lord bless his word and you may be seated you shall never fall now that's the promise that you ought to put like i said you ought to put that on your refrigerator you shall never fall amen so now last sunday we're talking about we come up through justification sanctification the baptism of holy ghost and we showed that this actually was the well we'll look at the chart here go ahead and pull it out we'll do it now we've we've we've um i don't like the word add to because you can't add to the word and you can't add to brother brown's chart okay but you can expand it a little bit and make it work a little bit to show excuse me the show because see faith equals a new birth equals the holy ghost is that right right so that's what we're talking about when we're talking about faith we're talking about the new birth amen faith is a revelation all right the new birth is a revelation the holy ghost is a revelation all right so that's that's your foundation faith equals a new birth equals the holy ghost and then we showed with justification and sanctification leads you to the new birth all right it's not the new birth all right but it leads you to the new birth and then you go all the way up leave that up so now we see that it takes the new birth to put us inside into the body of christ because you saw the chart where where jesus was standing inside the pyramid to put you inside the body of christ you have to be born again all right so now in justification and sanctification obviously you're working toward that but you're not in yet because listen just for a moment it's really simple but sometimes you need to explain it for all of us new ones and the ones that are slow of heart jesus said old fool and slow of heart well i was probably one of those all right so you know the brother said yesterday that jesus was was meek and mild well yay was but still when he walked in that temple he said you bunch of hypocrites your daddy is not my daddy now if i would say that to you guys y'all would think i was i was a little bit arrogant but it was the truth the truth is what hurts right if you're born again today i can talk about you being a devil all all day long and it won't bother you a bit right shouldn't amen all right so uh but i think jesus was put here for a purpose but and we're not to be arrogant but we're we're to be confident jesus was confident what he was doing he's trying to save him he's trying to get him to see that they were lost all right the same way with us i i'm like brother dale i see that more and more i wish that i could preach something that would convict you and convince you that you're lost because then you can start and say well i need to be forgiven of my past sins i need to be sanctified but all this all this junk that has been preached not of the message but in the message about just believing and you've got it no you've still got to go through those three stages of grace to be in the body of christ to have faith to have the new birth to have the holy ghost all right and remember these are requirements but you got to have a desire because diligence and desire is kind of the same thing to be diligent you got to have a desire to do it all right same way in life if we if we have something that we're working on if we're diligent toward that that means we have a desire okay we have a desire to to do better we should have a desire to do better in life i was thinking yesterday driving over to the fellowship meeting that us being humans we have to have we need a plan because remember the old adage in business that if you fail to plan your plan will always fail yeah okay same thing in like saying brother branham said god had a plan it's just that he don't plan and it fails he plans and it's eternal his plan is perfect what we've got to do though is is we've got to come into that part of the plan he made the plan and it's perfect not like me and you we'll make a plan and we'll say well now uh that didn't work too well let's shift over here no god when he made a plan that's the way it's got to be and you know what it's very simple because if the most illiterate person can get born again and you know what peter still couldn't sign his name and he was right there right right amen amen but he had the virtues working in his life because he trusted god and not lean to his education all right i don't advocate it literacy none at all i want your kids to go to school and finish go to college and finish make good money so you can pay good tithes that's what that brother said ron spencer is a little boy you know he comes up and he says uh they're gonna sign me for he had a boy in his church that was real good in college and he was getting ready to go the pros and he said brother ron he said what do you think about about this is this okay if i you know he said well follow your dream son he said just when you get that 20 million dollar contract in the pros he said don't forget to pay your tithe ty's has to run the church you know that's just the point to make i want you to i want you to we hang toward that peter was illiterate and all these people were literate what i'm showing you is you don't have to have a lot of book smarts right to be to be in god to be in christ and there's no there's no uh there's no big eyes and little use i mean sometimes and truly brother brown was saying our education does get in our way because it's our it's our philosophy that gets in the way that that a teacher has taught us you know out in the world so but we need to be taught but if we're taught by god then that'll never fail all right so his plan will never fail so his plan is so we got to have a plan we've got to enter into that same plan we don't need to make our own plan we need to just take god's plan and say all right this is what we've got to do and we got to be diligent as it said in first peter wait a second peter we got to be diligent about what we do so this is a diligence that we've got to do overcoming and remember we've got to suffer we must suffer to reign with him all right i'm just kind of backing up a little bit for some that weren't here or or what more but we come last sunday in justification and sanctification we come up to this to the new birth and we talked about that and we read ephesians let's go to ephesians 4. i'm just kind of condensed some of these scriptures down as a background i want to try to get into virtue and maybe knowledge this afternoon but this is how we get it now he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints so the only way you're going to get is you're going to have to hear all right for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god that's what i told him down in the sunday school class i don't want to i don't want to look at sister trudy mcmillan and say now trudy you've got to have that's not my business right i can tell you what you got to have sure by the word of god but what i want is different maybe than what god wants because you know you may have a temper in your life and i said well i want you to not have that temper well if you want to keep it god's not going to take it away from you and i'm sure not going to take it away from you i'm probably going to enhance it just a little bit hallelujah till we all come brother brown said god put somebody in your way and say something see oh you react till we all come in the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the son of god what i'm trying to say is i don't want everybody in this church to just say well i got virtue this one's got no you worry about yourself right we worry about our own self we work you know i i go home with me you go home with you okay and god is with you the whole time he knows what you need right okay till we all come to the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ all right so that starts though with what we want to start with is baby form faith now let's go to hebrews verse 13 and 14. so peter showed us what we needed paul showed us how to get it all right so this is the plan the plan of god the plan of god is is for peter to show us what it is and for paul to show us how to get it now hebrews 5 verse 13 for everyone that is that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of what use by reason of use have their senses exercised to do what discern and we're going to talk about that in knowledge because to me knowledge is discernment amen both good to discern what both good and evil not just good or not just evil both good and evil the holy ghost is given to us but you know what we've got to do what use it exercise our faith all right hebrews 6 verse 1 through 3. therefore we read this last sunday because we were on the foundation today we're going to speak on add to your faith all right because that's what the scripture says add to your faith you've got to obtain a faith and then you've got to add to it therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god what our problem is a lot of times and we'll talk about in a few minutes in that outer court and even in the inner court we have problems and we're in and out we go back to the to look to the foundation of repentance now listen we're to repent every day right but we're not to repent of the sins that we did that we repented of back when we should have been justified everybody got that sure it's like brother was talking yesterday god reminds him i mean sorry the devil reminds us of all that but god in his word said he would forget him he's already forget them forgot him never sees them even though we did them right and i have to depend and see i put my faith on that i put my faith on that god forgot i don't care whether the devil remembered but god forgot but let's don't keep going back because what we do is we move a little bit forward and we go back to that kind of repentance the justification part where we turned away from our past sins forget those people there's nothing you can do about it anyway that's all you can do is come down to repentance you can't go back and make it right a lot of it you can't amen not laying again the foundation so we're not putting a foundation and like he said we're not coming back and laying another one there's one foundation and that's faith of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on hands and the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit and i believe you will we had an instance not too long ago where brother came to to us about communion and said well every time i repent do i need to go get baptized again no that's what he's saying here don't let's don't go back and say man if i had to go back and get baptized for all the things i did i couldn't get anything done except stay in the water but we got to realize though that when i went down in that water in january back there in 1998 that stayed there i don't have to do it again amen if that was true repentance i don't have to go back to that that's what paul's talking about we don't have to go back to that sure it's okay to get baptized again if you didn't think this one was right or you were right amen because remember that's just a that's what a good conscious it gives you a good conscience that my sins were rolled away of my repentance and then for the outward appearance of people i was baptized same way with you because it doesn't take away your sins but it is an outward expression of an inward work all right so that's what paul's saying you don't have to go back to that every time every time you sin you don't have to go be baptized again of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands on the resurrection of the dead of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permits all right let's go to hebrews 11 6 that's what we were talking about last sunday but without faith it is impossible to please him who god right for he that cometh to god must believe that he is is what god you must believe he's god if you're going to believe in god you must believe he's god right all right i like that you got to believe he's god because remember this is all based on faith and faith is what believing we're going to read that in just a minute we're going to read the definition of of faith because i didn't read it last sunday but you must believe that he is what god total god exactly jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and a rewarder of them that there's that word again diligently seek him not dilatory diligent we must be diligent to seek god you know why because god knows we have to be diligent to seek him if not we let the devil in all right so now we go to hebrews 11. verse 1. we're just going to read verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen because remember it's like brother branham said it's not faith i don't have to have faith that june's here today i see her right so i don't my faith in that is not it's not it's not going to work now if she's gone somewhere and in a car and i don't know where she is then i've got to have faith that god's going to bring her here but now for her sitting there today i don't have to have faith for that because look same way with your new birth if you're born again you don't have to have faith to get born again again right now sure we know being born again but i'm talking about the one when he burns that soul out and puts himself in you don't have to go back through that again amen you don't have to go back that's why you got to settle this thing we if i don't if nothing else happens between this whole series settle one thing that you're born again because god can work with you then if you're born again now let's look at what the greek lexicon says about that word let's go to the definition brother it's pistus which is faith assurance believe belief then that belief fidelity conviction of the truth of anything belief look how many times that says belief so it's got to be something that you believe in right all right and this one in red i like this and relating to god it's the conviction that god exists and is the creator and ruler of all things the provider and bestower of eternal salvation through christ amen all right so that's what your faith must be based on it's like brother luke said yesterday we've got to know that that man right there died for us get away with our sins that's why he came that's the whole basis of christianity is faith not just faith it's faith in something right all right relating to christ a strong and welcome conviction or belief that jesus is the messiah through whom we obtain eternal salvation and the kingdom of god but look at that word belief belief belief of the predominant idea of trust where do we have to put our trust in in god right all right we put our trust in the word of god all right so look this is not just i hope so i think so maybe so this has got to be like i said hebrews there says we must believe that he is he is god and he's not going to change he's not going to have a different prayer we're not going to get halfway up the statue of perfect man's god is going to say no i think i'll change the plan now it's the plan forever for eternity that's god's plan forever settled in heaven and on earth all right so now let's go to uh back to the chart and i want to read you this quote over again i told you i like this and i'm going to keep reading it but just put the chart back up and we'll look at it again because i want to i want to mention something here that i didn't last weekend because we got to add to your faith so you got to have something before you can add right right it says add to your faith virtue so you got to have something to add that to all right and remember the foundation is faith and we never get away from that foundation of faith that's what i want you to see in just a few minutes that i believe may help you a little bit because sometimes when we look at this and we say well face at the bottom of the pyramid and then here i go working all the way up no people this faith all the way to the very top amen amen it's faith all the way do we leave this world it is faith all right now the first quote let's read it the statue of a perfect man paragraph 102 through 104. we're going to read that notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith so if you're born again you've got baby form faith amen you're a babe in christ so he's talking about drinking milk you are a baby you do have to start as a baby as a human being you have to start as a baby all right so as a christian you have to start as a baby that's right so you see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of it all right then he reads the same thing i read for without faith it's impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him see he must be and we're a skeptic when you're a skeptic of the bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until you first believe it so there's the faith what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life remember this quote i've read it every time i think i will read it every time you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise but first it's got to be faith let me stay on the foundation for a while now faith is what you must believe faith is what faith the substance of things hope for right see the only way you you can't pull virtue out and show it to me like a like a gift like a box the only way you're going to show it to it me or anybody in the world is what comes out of you all right but first you got to have faith let's stay on that foundation faith is what faith's the substance of things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things hoped for hebrews 11 see the evidence what is it what kind of an evidence a holy evidence we have come into a holy part of our life that's going to dominate something's going to dominate you either faith or doubt it's going to dominate who you are amen now look pull the chart go back to the chart just for a minute i want just for a second to show us maybe what is happening to a lot of us and i think if you'll go to the entry veil i think it's in 1956 it really explains it well but see you have this is the outer court okay when you look go back to the jewish go back to the jewish layout of the temple the temple had an outer court and if you look at the court we don't have it here i was going to try to find one but that's okay we all know what it is it's an open-air court if it rains you're going to get wet right sun's shining you're going to get hot if it's cold you're going to be cold because that's your ups and downs in life amen that's but you're not in there yet but you're in the outer court you know you're beginning to head towards something and then sanctification you have a little more protection you go into uh the second the the second court right which has got a few things in it that's not in the first court even the first court was called the court of the gentiles because the gentiles could come around that court right but they couldn't go into that next one right and obviously they couldn't go into the holy of holies right because there was your protection there was where that you had to badger skins and you were protected from the weather it wasn't the only thing that was in there was a shekinah glory see of god and the bread you know that was just and then what the priests do he walked in there one time a year with what blood and that covered them it didn't take away their sins it covered them now look when you get into this inner court it doesn't cover your sin it eradicates your sin takes it all away so when you come into this court you're sinless that's right so the outer court inner court you can take your your first first part see you're not in you have a lot of problems then you're sanctified you come into a court where the where the candles are which is an artificial light right that's an artificial light you're walking to light but now remember when you get in here it was just there was no light there was just the shekinah glory of god amen so that's what we're looking at now the shekinah glory of god you have come in here by faith we boldly come to the throne now because we have that we boldly go to the throne of grace why because we don't have a remembrance sure we do but remember the priests went in and then the bible says i believe there in hebrews 6 the priest went in and he come out but there was a remembrance of sin right because the next year he had to go back in the same court again that's what paul said he said you don't have to go back and be born again again not now with the blood of jesus christ once you enter in behind the veil this is that holy of holies amen so now the statue of a perfect man has taken on a different meaning that's the holy of holies and it's you and god not you and god and your wife or husband or your pastor it's you and god in that holy of holies all right amen sure we're still going to have problems because we need virtual dollars temperatures and all that but it's not going to be the problems we have here i go to church i don't come to church i don't feel saved i do feel safe well you know what i don't feel saved either about 70 of the time but i have to trust in god not me because the devil's going to tell you ain't saved the day you die unless he wants to really deceive you until you're already saved and you're not even justified yet that's the whole problem you have to you got to be careful in the end time in the end time it's a little bit different than the other ones have to deal with satan is so close he's right he's right there yeah satan is right now i'm not going up in here he's right there yeah that's where the devil is he's right there i mean a fine line but you know what once you enter into that holy of holies brother branham said that curtain dropped it was just that priest and god right and that was it that's the same way with you and i once you enter into this statue of a perfect man i'm going to tell you something it'll change your life because the new birth absolutely will change you your thoughts and everything else but now let's go to romans 10 verse 17 and talk i want to stay on faith just for a minute and then we're going to go to virtue so right here's how you get it here's the plan so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god right i looked outside in sister monica's class they were all standing outside in the foyer back there let's pick him up who's got zoe pick yours up let me see them now bud faith comes by hearing you see them when they come in they had plates they cut the plate in half and put two big ears and they got a little thing across and they were all they said we're to hear you there anna's got one there for if you want to put the the uh put one of the cameras on that hold it up anna anna hold it up put it on would you there you go i told them i said give every one of them to the adults give them to the adults forget the kids give them to the adults because faith comes by hearing right and hearing by what word of god not an almanac or other things like that it comes by hearing the word of god all right so let's go to quote number two and let's just i just want to reiterate that brother branham never changed his view on the new birth right this is this is preached a year after the seals and he's still preaching on justification sanctification of baptism in the holy ghost i want to strike that home because many people in this message believe that that you don't have to go through that anymore that he changed his doctrine and i do not i don't believe that not he don't he didn't believe it either so if he didn't believe it i don't believe him they can believe what they want to what it is it's the devil trying to soften this thing and make you where you think you're and he's going to make you religious but he can't make you a christian amen he can't make you christ-like because he doesn't know how to be christ-like all right how striking now he takes the place where we are to dwell in through the same process now he's called the church through justification called it through sanctification then filled it with the holy ghost and fire and he took it through a process that he himself the holy spirit himself the son of god see the son of god we're still talking about the son of god all right we haven't gotten to the son of man yet son of man is going to pray a little bit further but we're talking about the son of god remember he built his church on the revelation of the son of god so that's what he's saying right here could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through that before he can come into it all right so you've got to go through it before you can come into it right all right because remember it's out of and then two you got to come out and go in all right so it's out of an n2 all right so now let's go to number three get some of these quotes out of the way now there's where the thing comes in paragraph 134 of the statue of perfect man we're going to talk about or out of house this foundation is first what is the foundation of christianity amen faith in the word of god glory that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation all right now let's go i didn't read these but i want to read these here this go to number four and five and then i'm gonna make a comment and then we will start with virtue now this is questions and answers in 1964 all right he talks about but i want to this is what's happening to us right here this first conscious controls this body with sea taste filled smelling here it's just got all scrupled up see you can take your the way he drew the three circles the the the seatays feel smell in here the memories and conscious affection and the inner court that's the same way with outer court inner court holy holies all right same thing it's got all scrupled up we reason and everything else but that new body that comes from this born again right so now you didn't get a new human body when you got born again right amen i wish we had off got a new body when we were born again a human body but we didn't because remember god starts from the inside and works his way out all right but that new body that comes from this born again not this first conscious it'll pass away all right it's that inside something that lives everybody understand it say amen amen congregation replies amen it's not this outside sea tastes field smelling here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die now that's the one that's going to start growing up this statue of a perfect man all right because watch what he's saying and that's the person that the new life starts from right from this new birth amen and it builds another person exactly in the image of this person you are around that life you get it so what it starts in the center it starts in the center of you and works its way out and builds another person because you know what you're not the person it's not another person there's not two of you are not schizophrenic because remember it's either faith or doubt right right it's not faith and doubt right faith and doubt would be another person in there and y'all would be fighting but no it's another person what it's going to do it's going to change you amen it's going to change the person you are god and you brother brown said there as persons he vulcanizes his life to you amen amen and then what this is my soul but god gave me his soul right when god given me anything it's now mine now that new birth is mine glory it's mine it's in my soul it's mine and he can't have it back he don't want it back he wants you to try to give it to somebody else amen so now watch out we're going to read number five and this is what i want you to watch what he's saying this is chapter nine the layout of seeing church age and there's no paragraph number so you'll just have to look it up if you want to if you want to look it up or go online and get this off watch this take a good night he's in the loudest in church age so it's our church ages what we're this is where we're living today right this is where we're living today y'all need to wake up i don't know what y'all drink this morning but it sure wasn't energy juice if you sleep now you're going to be really sleeping second serving take a good look around you examine the people as they walk by and the multitudes you see can you pick out those that have the appearance of christians right right watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they say see where they go it's like brother luke was talking about last night you go to a ball game this is eternal life and the ball game's worthless and people jump up and down he said he had a song leader i'll tell you about he said he had a lot song leader that said he wasn't emotional well the song leader took him to a clemson basketball game clemson scored a three-pointer right at the end of the game and won by one point or got up by one point he said he looked over there and that guy was ah he said he looked over and he said me and you gonna have a problem sandy but remember it's what our desire is it's what our desire is watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they say see where they go surely there ought to be some real evidence of the new birth amongst all those we see go by but few there be yet today the fundamental churches are telling us that they have millions saved and even spirit-filled spirit-filled question mark he's asking the question can you call women and i'm going to say he he talks about i'm going to say men too women's a little more obvious because you can see the outward appearance but us men the same way can you call women spirit-filled that go around with frizzy bobbed hairs shorts and slacks halters and briefs all painted up like jezebel if these are adorned in modest apparel as becometh christian women i would hate to think what it would be like if i had to witness a display of immodesty yeah all right so i'm saying the same thing with the men the men i mean what is it what we'll scroll it back down scroll back down to the to the top watch what they watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they say i'll guarantee you if you'll just be quiet and listen long enough people will tell you where they are amen hear what they say see where they go yeah surely they ought to be some real evidence of the new mirth amongst all those we see go by but listen just as the denominational world has eroded the baptism of the holy ghost saying it's just shake a hand or come to church or be good or whatever you know be no be halfway good all right but they've done the same thing in the message they've eroded the life of the new birth and they're teaching the people that well you just got to believe the message well the devil believes the message so he's part he's in the he's in the he's in there in line to get just what we got no he's not he's not in my inner court right right he's not in my holy of holies now he may be in that outer court but he's not in that holy of holies if he is then you're not born again all right so now look but that's a good one they take a look around examine the people and the multitudes you see can you pick out those that have the appearance of christians sure we can see the appearance of religion but we can't can we see the appearance of christians you know you you go into places and you see a uh you have to look at the whole thing because you see a you see a woman walk by and her hair's real long but then when she turns around she's got earrings in you know i mean the whole picture doesn't go together now some will some will have long hair just because they like it and some some ladies like to wear dresses and obviously some of them wear half dresses or third dresses i don't see how worlds you can pay 20 something dollars for one of them things that they show on them racks that that ain't got enough material that this 8x11 piece of paper's got so but that shows but they're showing what they are inside and you got to do the same thing you got to show what you are but it's going to come from the inside now brother brown talks about being mate believers and he talks about in a statue of a perfect man he talks about the black birds sticking peacock feathers in it'll work for a little while but all of a sudden those peacock feathers fall off and you make the mistake of showing the crow again that's what we want to do but we want to drive that crow out and we want to make sure that we're a peacock or a dove and that dove is going to be right there at the bottom called faith all right pull the chart back up just one more time so we got justification sanctification faith which is a new birth in the holy ghost all that right that's your that's your holy of holies that is the divine that puts you in line for the divine nature of god you're a son and daughter of god and you're ready to receive these virtues into your life and you have a portion of them you would have a portion of virtue because once you get born again obviously people are attracted to you yeah that are christians remember i think we read the quote the other day about brother brown he said he well see he could feel the vibration he could not he'd know he he felt that spirit and you know what it gives off a different vibration it must because brother adam will walk up and he'd take somebody by the hand he said i see you're a christian well he wasn't looking at outside appearance right right he said he said because our spirit is common our spirit is welcome he'd always say your spirit is welcome now he would tell some of him he never said a word to him he said you need to repent you need to get right and you need to get born again well you know what that was there was a different spirit there a different vibration coming off of that person so that's the same way with you and i once you get in that holy of holies listen if you're born again and i'm born again just like i read you the quote last sunday it don't make you act different basically different than i do now if my holy ghost says i need to be here and listen to the word of god and listen to the pastors prophets teachers evangelists and all those things then yours should do the same thing that's why it's really it's really hard to get people to see that they don't have the new birth they just have a religious experience now i'm telling you i got the new birth all right you're not going to talk me out of it but i'm not going to stay away from church i thought it drove you to church i didn't think it drove you away from it now it's your own stinking ideas that take you away from it amen but add two all right let's i'm gonna read this don't bring it because i've already got it but ii peter 1 says add to your faith add to your faith virtue so it's your faith this morning you got to know whether it's your faith or you're either believing unto which you can because remember let me give you an example you say well i got to be born again to start getting these that's exactly the truth but remember the disciples they held the word that they had and they weren't born again right they held the word that jesus spoke didn't understand it right obviously didn't live it peter was still wanting to cut people's ears off and curse and all these other things but once he come up to that day of pentecost all that word that had been piled into him come to life amen and he had virtue and knowledge but he was still growing in god he was still growing in god but you can have my brother adam said you can have a portion of these virtues but you can't have god virtue you can't have god virtue and not be born again right you can have a part of virtue but now we're going to talk about virtue now but remember i want you to see this when we read that scripture i want you peter says add to your faith virtue now let's put this to the word and let's read between the lines add to what you believe virtue because it is what you right after your faith in faith believing so add to what you believe so it's got to be based on what you believe add to what you believe virtue so let's go to virtue and it's got to be according to the word it's got to be according to what the scripture says but it's all based on faith amen it's not seen but it can be shown right if i get these virtues it can't be seen even the new birth can't be seen exactly but it can be shown right all right it's going to be shown you're going you're going to in this age of manifestation we're going to manifest who we are whether we want to or not all right but it's all got to be based on based on this right here we never leave that foundation of faith you say oh you just read where it says leaving the foundation well you know what we're not going to leave this foundation of faith what we're going to do is we're going to carry it with us amen we're going to carry it with us because look the character or the are the um the construction of this building gary brother gary depends on the foundation right right the structural integrity of this building still determines whether that foundation's good underneath us or not right because if you don't you see cracks you'll have leakage you'll have you see what i'm saying same way with you if that foundation's not right and you take that foundation all the way up through the walls and into the top you're gonna crack somewhere all right so you got to have that good foundation all based on faith all right now we're going to go to virtue now this virtue right here is obviously if we're born again we should be living a virtuous life anyway true so this must mean just a little bit right more than just living a virtuous life because if you're born again you are the virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ so you already are virtuous but do you have this godly virtue as the prophet brought i believe we have to have it and that's probably where we don't understand what this virtue is all right because i want to brother branham i'll let him tell you what it is and then we're going to talk about it let's go to quote number six but remember this is all based on what faith right add to your faith what's what's this right here number six paragraph 141 now here is what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation then after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation add to your faith in other words add to what you believe you gotta you gotta add to what you believe right gotta start somewhere you gotta believe okay believe that he is what god and a rewarder what is his reward that's his reward his reward is giving you the virtues that he has first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith now this is what the lord showed me i want you to try to get try to get involved with this because look if you never leave the foundation of faith and we're going to talk about virtue because virtue is what obviously we mostly we know what it is it's strength okay it's strength all right it's strength and what you believe but we don't need to just have virtue and not just have faith we must have virtue faith i know you're not getting it it'll take a little while but you must have ver if you add verse you you add to your faith virtue you must now have virtue faith which is not just faith because faith alone won't do it you got to have strong faith amen so you see how we're going to add all these right here he put it on there i wanted to put on it now we have to have virtue faith we never leave the foundation of faith but now we must have virtue faith all right so let's go to mark and let's look at an example mark 5 verse 30. and here's one of the times that virtue is used and jesus immediately knowing himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him around in the press and said who touched my clothes all right so we know that and we're going to read another one in a little while but not right this second i want you to look here now many times i think brother ernie preached on this one time but not at virtue he preached on dunamis you must have power right you must have power power is dunamis if you look that word up you know it says right here in the thing it says to click on all the all the scriptures that this is pertaining to it's mostly power might strength and miracles yeah it's what that word virtue means all right so power jesus christ had to have the power before that power because remember if you have power and then something's drawn like you you plug in a you have a little generator running like we did now at the hunting camp you keep plugging stuff in what's that generator going to do it's going to go weaker and we cause what you're pulling strength out of that generator all right same way with a power grid if you take and take that's what happened in new york they they burst that power grid because people were drawing so much power out of it well there had to be power there to draw from now god's power never gets weak so we're going to have to worry about pulling too much power from god all right you go don't say well i think i'll just well i'm not going to pray for that brother because i may not god may not forget it that's silly but dunamis is power mighty work strength miracle might virtue might strength power and ability but watch this it's inherent power you inherit it right if you get born again you inherit virtue inherent power power residing in a thing by virtue of what it's nature now what do we get the divine nature of god so in the divine nature of god lays virtue power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth power for performing miracles right moral power and excellence of soul so even the even the greek scholars realize that it had to start in that soul and work its way out but look inherent power power strength so in other words we got to have not just faith we got to have a strong faith we got to have a powerful faith we got to have something that somebody can draw from we don't have it you can't draw from it brother brown makes the example and we're not going to read it but let's go to acts 1 8. this is one of the first ones it comes to is right here that same virtue that left jesus when the lady touched his garment is the same word right here for that word power right it takes you right to that acts 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power after after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me in jerusalem and judea and samaria and utter most parts of the earth remember this is jesus before he ascends you shall receive power so now we're looking at virtue faith we're looking at the faith that we have with power added to it amen amen we're looking at the power and strength that god gives us through what word of god amen now this is one i really like go to acts 3. you've heard me mention this before but we're going to read it a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful now look hundreds of thousands of people have walked by that man for years walked by that man never able to help him just like the woman that had the blood issue she went to all the doctors like brother brown gives the illustration she spends all of her money on physicians nobody was able to help her by the gate which is called beautiful last alms of them that entered into the temple who's seeing peter and john about to go in the temple they were going to church dear jesus i can't believe some of you people don't come back second service i'm sorry but that just gets it just burns my britches burns gods too but you know what i can't answer for you we need all the help we can get i don't care who we are and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us look on us and that man probably looked at peter and he probably been fishing that day he didn't see a lot and see see a lot but he was fixing to understand yeah and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john and said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive some money can i is that changing the word no because that's what he was expecting because he sure didn't see anything outwardly that he was going to get okay but people had been giving him money because peter said look look on us and he gave heathen expecting to receive something of them then peter and said peter said silver and gold have i none now see he would have been lying if he had money in his pocket he had nothing peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have that's right he had virtue faith because remember that guy didn't have no faith he was asking for money he wasn't even asking for healing amen was he asking for healing no he was asking for money right all right so peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and the guy just didn't jump straight up he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received virtue virtuous strength but it had to be in peter before he could give it out peter didn't have to go pray for it and and i think sister johnny uh the other day for uh she gave me a video or a video of it was called a.d which was after jesus's death i can't remember what that means in in latin but it's after it's talking of the disciples and it shows peter and june and i were watching it and i said look at his face but peter peter said silver and gold have i known you the actor was saying silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give unto thee rise up and walk well when the guy gets up peter's like he's a little bit shocked himself and i think maybe peter might have been just a little bit shocked himself but he had the resilience in his heart that that he'd never said it if he knew that man wasn't going to get up right all right silver and gold have i none but such as i have now see to me that's beginning to give us power with character remember power without character is satanic but power with character the very first thing besides our faith god is giving us power he's given us the strength to make it through because you know what's gonna be a hard journey it's not a picnic it's not forks and spoons it's swords and shields helmets you gotta fight your way to heaven amen you got to fight your way to heaven this is not a flowery bed of ease but to have virtue faith is what you and i need to have all right let's go to first corinthians 4 and 20. here's another one this one takes you right back to that same when jesus said virtue left him power or strength this is the next one that comes up first corinthians 4 20 says for the kingdom of god is not in word that's a little bit of the word that's not big word that's a little that's in the letter of the word okay so don't get it wrong is that saying well he's not in the word he's not in the letter of the word he's not in just the written part okay but in power all right because look power without character that's where brother branham got that i believe power without character is satanic he's beginning god's starting right there at virtue now an example of all of us would be brother dale or or a minister or a deacon or somebody that you that you want to pray for you why do you want them to pray for you your holy ghost is discerning that they have virtue or strength maybe more than you got at that moment let's just be honest maybe more than you got at that moment you're going to somebody in your ass and said hey pray for me and what you're saying is pray for me that the strength that you have will come on me amen that's what we do and we we rely on brother dale that's why i listen pastorship is is very expensive not monetarily it's very expensive it wears you out it takes from your body why jesus looking 50 years old and he was only 30. what brother brown said the toils of his ministry look at brother branham he died at 56 years old you know i'll be 55 next monday i won't be far from where where he's at and but look at him deep set eyes you look at his hands on some of those pictures he looks like about a 60 year old man why the toils the strength think of the think of the power brother branham said oh i said look at jesus got weak he said look at me a center saved by grace and he'll go through the prayer line and maybe 10 or 15 people and they have to carry him off what was it it was the virtue that was flowing out of that man it was the power that the man had given to him by god by a gift you say well that was a gift of healing that's fine but you and i get the same gift right not at that level right there was only one there was only one part of that healing campaign where brother randall could do that what he did amen amen okay so we're not trying to be that anymore but where did that all go away it didn't we just got to believe that that power is still here it's just in a many-membered body that we can all pray for the sick that we can all you know it's what i was last weekend i was thinking when i was laying those prayer cloths on there and and y'all were taking them home i thought god let that be power not from me but from the word of god let that power of the word and acts 19. you say well it's not working for me go back and put acts 19 on top of you remind the devil where it's at exactly because the devil's in here is the one that's trying to get you to get away from it so you don't have to call him anywhere he's right there but just remind him and that's what peter was saying look silver and gold have i none but such as i have i'll give to you if you'll believe rise up and walk for the kingdom of god is not word it's not in word but in power that's right all right so that's where our i want you to look at this one let's go to matthew six this one was shocking kinda but the same that same word power is the same word jesus used when he said verse you had went from me all right watch this and lead us not into temptation you know what this is and delivers for but delivers from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power right the virtue and the glory forever amen the virtues listen we must have virtue faith not just virtue virtue of strength we must have a powerful faith or a strong faith and where does it come from it comes from the word of god it comes from teaching and it comes from reading your bible and it comes from studying um you know many times we we go through the week and sometimes and i know life gets tough and i know so and it's happened to me uh you know i don't i try every morning because i don't have to go to work till about 7 30 which is early for a lot of you but it's late for me but uh i get up at 5 30 every morning you know what i check my emails and i'll check the weather and i'll you know check certain things and i'll sit down though and read several verses of scripture and some days like on saturday when i sleep a little bit later and i don't do that i miss it you should miss reading the word of god some of us miss reading what put it xyz you should miss reading the word of god you should miss because that's where your power is going to come from you've got to believe number one that god is right and then that god sent a five full ministry to you not sister gwen but brother joe brother joe's got to believe he's sending to brother joe right you got to believe that he sent it for you and when you walk in here and you sit down you draw from what the power right amen but it's your faith it's the power that you add to your faith it's power faith or virtue faith so that's what really the lord showed me because we're going to go through all these and we're going to have knowledge faith we're going to have temperance faith godliness faith because what is it it's all based on faith you don't leave faith down here you just carry faith right on up here because you know what that woman had faith and it connected with the power that jesus had right so you can have faith today but not have enough power to get over that healing i mean to get over that sickness or whatever we always lean on healing i like healing of the soul also glory healing of the soul to me is a lot better than healing of the body you can be healed of a heart attack or a heart condition and die of a heart attack tomorrow and still it was god that healed you but you can't get born again and then tomorrow need to get born again again right all right so the the healing of the soul is what we need to be speaking of but virtue faith something strength added to your faith amen all right so we must have virtue faith all right let's let's go to quote number seven and we'll stop right here and then we'll back up build background virtue a little bit and we'll start on knowledge we're gonna start going through these and watch this statue of a perfect man 1962 paragraph 144 and the bible says we read over here in the book of luke it says virtue went out of him that right congregation says amen if we're going to be like him right we must have virtue then i mean who doesn't want to be like jesus amen we must have it to be like him to be like him we got to have it right and then we must have it to be like him it's the first song i ever loved in the hymns one of the greatest was to be like jesus well if i'm going to be like jesus i've got to have virtue right he didn't stop there and a path that it can pass forward from me to the people god gives you faith at the new birth then he gives you virtue faith that you can give it to other people amen give it away greatest thing in the world and you give it want to give it away virtue because virtue went out of hymn to the people verse you and before you can let it out you've got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and check would return insufficient funds see no no none there to draw from check bounce somebody looked at you as a christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner not much virtue can be drawn from that see right virtue must must be in us and until we get virtue then when we get true virtue virtue faith we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it right faith alone won't do it faith alone will get you born again faith will only get you in the body of christ faith alone will get you get you into into the holy of holies with god but he doesn't want you to stay that way right faith won't do it you've got peter said then add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith now then it might be the reason you don't have it it's because many churches a day teaches you don't have to have it same way in the message or the days of or the days of it has passed they don't have to have it the only thing you have to do is just join a church yeah days is past virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means see and we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church amen because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what his virtue virtue is strength and power amen amen everybody got that we must have let's stand virtue faith we must have strength how do you get strength from the word of god doing what god said will give you strength or virtue so see i i want you to look sure virtue is a virtuous person it's a you know it's something you do that uh that gives you uh um you know favor with the people but still that favor with the people has got to have a way to get out right amen so i say about about pastors pastors must have so much strength and virtue that you know what you're pulling every sunday and every wednesday you're pulling from the gift of god glory and that gift of god is a vessel right but you know what too you can draw it from the word of god yourself you can draw that strength from the word of god but you got to remember the ethiopian eunuch he was drawing from the word but he didn't have it lined up see remember he said is this man talking of a self or of another well somebody that had the new birth had to come philip had to come and put the word together for him and what was the first thing the ethiopian unit said where's water yeah where's water i got some strength now i got some strength in this that i'm reading where's the water right hey man so the problem with us all is is number one we must have the new birth number two we must have virtue faith to be able to give it out to other people or even to have strength for you to make it through life right but remember like brother brown said god doesn't want you to keep it he wants an outlet amen an outlet where he can give virtue from somebody to another person because we're all weak in certain areas and we need faith or strength to bring us back up go ahead number 67 to be like jesus be like jesus if you have a knee today a from earth to glory i only am you know we all want to be like our earthly parents to a degree but why not want to be like our heavenly father that's where that strength comes from be like him to be like jesus to be like jesus to be like him all three glory i only am to be like jesus to be like jesus to be like all three like
