========================================

my heart beers [Music] I want to say to see you shining in the light of your glory pull out your power say [Music] shine in the hold on to power [Music] Oh Oh [Music] I want to see amen that's our desire tonight I was I was laughing at brother Anderson back there cuz uh we thought he was gonna get here a little bit late at night and he turned out he beat me so we I think what happened was everybody was looking at that big bright moon out there tonight and it slowed everybody down a little bit but I believe there's a scripture about how the one day the light of this moon will be as the light of the Sun and it looks like it's just about that light but I believe that scripture was speaking of something else of a people that have become the word until the light of the sun is shining through them just as if the Sun itself was here so let's look and if you've been listening to Sunday School lessons then you've heard a little bit about what I'll be speaking tonight so might be a little bit of a rehash and you know sometimes it's kind of hard to retain everything so that maybe maybe we'll just kind of look at some of the things that I've been talking about again so let's go ahead and and I'm gonna be reading from John chapter 17 and John chapter 16 and really what it is if you remember when brother Brian preached the message birth pains he his pages stuck together and he ended up reading these two scriptures one that he didn't intend to read and the other that he didn't tend to read and so we'll look at will look at both of these scriptures but before we go to the word let's go to the author the Lord Jesus we just bow our heads and our hearts to You Lord tonight Lord all of us have come from a long way many have come together tonight not to see each other or anything that we know that's part of going to church but we've come to see you Lord and I pray God that you'll just open the eyes of our heart tonight as we sing that song or Jesus and Lord we just invite you Lord to come and be welcome here tonight or that you're quicker in the words of our heart floors granted I pray Lord that the words that I that might be spoken the night will not be said in vain nor that they won't just go out into the ether as it but Lord that you quicken somebody give somebody deliver in a store tonight as we know that deliverance comes from your word Lord I pray God that you'll just quicken the word tonight Lord Jesus we pray and we ask these things as we go to the word and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's start off with the scripture that that brother Branham did not intend to read and we know this is the Lord's Prayer as Jesus prayed in John chapter 17 and he was speaking about you as you read this thing about how he was thinking of you as they pray this prayer and he said in verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that thou that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hath sent me now now think about that that's that's really what birth pains is is growing growing up into a place where you are in unity with God that through his word you become one with him and and remember when when brother I'm read this the the archbishop the Catholic priest or whatever his title of role was he he came up behind brother Branham and gave him his Bible and he said he said these words just draw breath there's a reason why it was done and you know what God will show you something to bring out of this that's wonderful think about such words that would be spoken by a Catholic archbishop and how true they are something will be brought out of this that's wonderful I'm gonna take my jacket off and then let's go over to John chapter 16 verse 22 21 verily verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy and that's what we've been talking about birth pain there's always there's pains and sorrow and joy and agony and all the things that go along with that before a child comes into the world of course a lot of you sisters are well-acquainted with those things in a way that the brothers can really never be but we're not talking about a natural childbirth tonight we're talking about the birth as my title tonight is the birth of the promised son unless in the end unless finish with verse 21 a woman when she is travail hath sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers no more than wish for joy that a man is born into the world he may be see that the Lord has a blessing to the reading of the word and you know that's what you know brother Branham always taught us and not put a period behind what we believe because there's always there's more to come more to unfold and I think that's true about the new birth as well you think well I understand the new birth it's justification sanctification the baptism oligo is what the baptism Holy Ghost is what all the different parks and all the different things but you know what it just keeps magnifying and unfolded so tonight I'm gonna preach speak to you a little bit about the new birth but it I believe that it just keeps unfolding and folded into a higher reality and you notice in John chapter 16 verse 21 it says for joy that a man is born into the world and you know a lot of times in the Old Testament they would be desiring for a man child to be born they'd called a man-child because if one day that child was gonna grow into a man but I believe now we're talking about tonight I want to talk about their birth of a man-child because you know when you're born again you start off as a little child you start off with a little baby and in the gospel and and you know maybe tossed her out about by every wind the dock for knowing not knowing you know who's preaching right and what's going on so much but and then you just keep eating the word and and growing and and eating the word and growing until until you've come into adulthood and and that's what the down authors are seven church ages God has been building a church from a little baby forms the foundation of faith and to into an adulthood just the same way that he builds the individual from a foundation of faith into adulthood and you know you look at all these little Old Testament stories of children being born and and now I believe we can look back on those stories with kind of a renewed understanding of what's what's taking place like the story of of Abraham and Isaac how he's you know the story of Abraham how he went through the three different parts of the the prefigure of of justification and sanctification and the babs's mela ghost as God turned him aside and then he he put in his sleep and he saw the the burning lamp and played out that part of it and then on until he finally met the man met the son of man there talking to him and and and he stayed there with him until he had understanding what was gonna take place down and with with lot and Sodom and Gomorrah and he any and he hung around until Adam Abraham had an idea of what was gonna take place but you know really the culmination of all that story was the son coming into being the promised son and he promised that he was going to have a child and that little that child typed Christ in all the different aspects of his of Isaac's story how he he he yielded himself up to be sacrificed it gave himself over to his his father to do whatever he saw fit and and and just kind of played out that whole story and then you know you know you look over at another story like Ruth and Boaz how Ruth went through all the story of redemption and how her husband died and you could type that as how Adam lost it in his inheritance he he wasn't able to redeem get ever the situation back to the way it should and and Ruth went through all the different stories of the harvest time and and getting the the wheat in the field and barley and all the different things that happened to to play out the story of redemption and finally at the very last of that whole story she ate she has a baby in her arms and that whole story really is talking about its working its way up to the bringing forth of this child and so you know there's so many other stories that I'm gonna relate to you in a moment let me get a drink of water so I don't leave my boy but you know you think you you look at these stories and you think well now I understand I understand the new birth that the new birth is God being birthed into me but a hold on because there's more there's more to come there's more beyond just a new birth there's a lot more that goes into that like brother Branham said that that he said the new birth is is kind of like an automobile or if you were a mechanic you can look at it and see all this for parts and things you say the new birth but there's a lot that goes into that there's a lot of different moving pieces and there's a gasoline and sparks and all these different things that goes into the new birth and so I you know I you look at you and you discuss with people today even in the message and the engine and they say well I've got the new birth I'm ready for the rapture but are you because there's more to there's more to take in a rapture than just saying I'm born again we know that we know the born-again believers are gonna go in the rapture you but the problem is and this is one of the controversial statements if you don't come to maturity you might have to die first well you will have to die for and I know that that uh maybe maybe that was not wise let me just say it like that with going out on the internet what not cuz that that you know that that's sort of confusing to a lot of people but that's the reason that brother Brennan preached these sermons like the statue of a perfect man that we have on the wall behind us and and adoption why did he preach adoption why did he preach all those things was it just just for fun just for just to kind of how share share his amount of knowledge that he had noticed so that you could know that you have to have some things beyond the new birth and so look at all these other little stories like well I think of Hannah crying she's got she's her husband has a I forget what his name was at the moment but she he had another wife who had a child he had children but yet Hannah and brother branham said that she had gotten too old she had gotten too old to have children the Bible says that the Lord had sealed up her womb and so she was unable to have children and look at a lot of these other people like Abraham also Abraham and Sarah were too old you know think about how Hannah's conversation when she her confession when she went down to pray before the before the priest and to make her confession to the Lord her confession was not based upon her circumstance but it was based upon the Word of God that I believe that all things are possible to them that believe she was she was making a confession really that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I think sometimes a lot of times today we look at the circumstances around us we look at our predicament and we say we say well I'm too old to have a child or now we're getting too old too old too you know we just look at the at the situation that we're in and think about think about the rapture because we're gonna take a rapture and you look around at the predicament of what looks like the church today what looks like the bride and and it and it to be honest you can almost slip into doing like how Balaam was looking at the hinder part saying well there how in the world are those people gonna take a body change how it with all the problems with all the ones that are moving along a little bit of slower pace as the other ones people still not dressing right wearing may doing all the things that they shouldn't that are really message 101 how are they going to take a body change but you know if you go back to looking at the statute of perfect man and look at patience that's what he said it was be patient and just remember that God the same God that was called you out of sin and death and all those things is able to call others out as well and he's moving us all toward taking a body changed and we're gonna take a body change somebody's gonna take a body change because he promised him it was written it's written in God's Word excuse me the Lord help me you know y'all pray for my throat so Hannah was there she was praying for a man-child she's praying for this child and God came on the scene and gave her this child that was was really one of the judges one of the deliverers of Israel and then you keep moving on up moving on up as God does greater and greater and now we've got Israel Israel down in the land of Egypt and they're in bondage in there and they begin to cry out for a deliverer for God to send them a son send them somebody that can come upon the scene and deliver them and you look at these pains that they were going through as their taskmasters whip them and beat them and and and they're crying out has God forgotten us and and then God comes upon the scene and gives them the Promised One and and how what a strange story of how he was put in a little basket his mama gave him away so that she could get him back that's a story that a lot of us could learn from as well for our own children if you want to get your kids back give him over to God and make her confession and let God handle let me let God deal with them because God could God can deal with your kids God can deal with the people that you're praying for and calling out to God for for deliverance and ways that you can't you can't really maybe even imagine and so so this this son was was born to the people and led them out of Egypt led them out of captivity but he said and Deuteronomy 18:15 the LORD thy God will raise up under the prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto Him ye shall hearken and so one day that son which all of the Old Testament was looking toward was pointing towards that son came on the scene that man-child who was the Word made flesh and when I say the word made flesh I'm talking about the eternal God that encompasses all of the attributes of God everything that's in a savior and and Redeemer and all of that was bottled up inside of that man he was the one that came to die for our sins - to pay the price for us everything was bottled up in that man all that God was he poured into Christ his what brother Branham said everything that makes up God was put into that man and so he was the son the son the son of God the Son of David the son of Abraham the son of man put inside of that man and and nobody knew about it except for little shepherds nobody wide had to be shepherds either that that man he was put into it they laid him in a manger but a feed trough because you know what he was that bread that came down from heaven and if you want to go or he is you've got to eat the body word and so they put him in a manger into a feed trough because that's the way to get to him that's the way to be born out of this world out of this fear is to is to eat the body word of Christ and you know that's what that's what being that's what the the birth of the promised son is about to birth us from one world to the next you know the problem is we can't see with our natural eyes that of the world just like a baby being born from its womb from the womb of the mother it can't see the other world so you know what you have to do you have to look to the unseen and the only way that you can look to the unseen is to believe that war of God that's been preached to you let's been that's been shared to you by some man some vessel that God got inside of him and used his lips that used his body used his hands at his feet to carry the gospel blessed are the feet of those that preach the gospel the lips of the ones that preach the word so that when you hear that you hang on to it and it begins to take you and transform you from this world from the things of this earth into another world into an unseen realm I'm getting off my notes a little bit here but look look at what Abraham Abraham was looking to the unseen he called the things that were as though they were not he looked around him and all the circumstance and the things and and and he said I don't even believe this anymore I believe that one day like brother man I've always talked about he began to make the booties and and and lay aside all the little bassinet and all the different things so that he would have a little baby and I was we went we went down to the Louisiana camp that last year we had they had the little sister Mariah that had had lost all of her hair and and they were telling a testimony about how she came up and she she had like a little hat or I forget exactly what she had but she came confessing and believing that God was going to restore her hair to her and I don't know if you've heard that testimony before but a year later just appeared a while later God came on the scene and restored her hair to her you know you you walk into your confession you believe count the things that you see is though they are not because the bride is supposed to be a people that they're not looking at the stuff around them you know you're looking to the unseen you're looking to an unseen world another another place another store up your treasures in heaven not here the story or treasures up there because there is where your heart will be where your where your treasures are you know brother Branham preach sermons like like countdown where he talked about how the world has a does their countdown 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 but we're going in the opposite direction from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and what that what it is is it's a blast off from this world from this sphere into another world you think about worlds now you know in this mentality to the into the ocean for example if you go to way down into the deep there are things that live in that world they can't live in this world you can't take a blue whale and put him on the land you can't take a grey whale and put him on the land but unless something were to happen unless maybe just just for you to imagine a picture in your mind if God were able to do something to a blue whale to transform him to the power of transformation so that he could live on land so that he maybe if God were to put like lungs or feet on a blue whale and transform it so that it could take come out of that world and come into this world where the same thing God is doing to you and I he's transforming us so that we come out of this world come out of the the world cosmos of sin and death and the heartache and all this stuff that makes up this world and he's transforming us from this world into another world where we'll go and eat have communion with God around the sphere of the earth and then come back and he'll transform this world to be to be eternal a better place where we can live forever and that's these birth pains the birth pains the reason they come home the reason there's birth pains the reason that were birth pains at Abraham's day when he had to keep digging whales and he kept forgetting run off until he finally dug the third well the reason that were those kind of pains is because he had a confession he believes something had heard a message from God a message from heaven and that created a struggle and strife the reason that were birth pains with Cain and Abel is because Abel had heard a message from God and he believed it and he told what he believed to Cain and Cain said I don't like that so he knocked him upside the head the reason there are birth pains is because there's a coming forth from this world into another world and you watch you watch the birth pains in the natural the birth pains in the natural signify how close you are to the child being delivered and you can look in the world and the world system but the Bible says when you see the fig tree putting forth is figs you know that summer draws nigh and so you look over Israel and see that summers Joe and I because the fig tree is putting forth its buds all these things are taking place around the world and you know that something's happening and you can look at your own self but your own live and see the struggle that's taking place and now the word is being revealed in you and you can see that birth pains just give me to spit over the place birth pains are producing something real it's not the potential anymore but it's sort of living reality what what have you been looking at through a glass darkly is now plain before your face because the Sun is coming into view like like I was talking earlier that about the moon the moon now if the moon is the bride the moon now is bearing the light of the Sun where if you want to see what God looks like come and look at the bride the bride is coming into view she's being birthed you could maybe title this the birth of the bride because the bride is being born she's being born from the word she's coming out of the church and being produced in the view let me let me coming down a little say a little bit so you can understand me I'm a star snorting and spitting so look when Jesus was born now he went through a natural growth period where you know it came out as a little baby in his maybe his brain had to go develop and his body had to grow and he couldn't walk it at first and just like any normal little baby staggered in the street and maybe his mama had to jerk him out of the way of a car going by real fast and things like that but as he began to grow he was the word all of the word bottled up into that person and so that was never a point I don't believe when he didn't know who his real father was because he came out knowing who his father was even when a little boy in the temple he was instructed asking question he was asking questions but he was asking questions in a way that those priests and Pharisees and whatnot began to realize that maybe they didn't know the Bible like they thought they did and when his mom and Daddy came looking for him his earthly mom and dad is incubator let's say like that began it came looking for me corrected her and said don't you know that I must be about my father's business because he knew who his father was and if he knew who his father was when he was born what about you and you're born you've got to know who you let me come down no your father is John chapter 10 25 to 30 Jesus it talks about Jesus knowing who his father was knowing who he was and knowing that there ain't no such a thing as a Trinity because the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost is all one person I want to say to you tonight that we don't believe in a Trinity we believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if he was the same whatever his attributes were back there if he is tavern if you take that same life in the same spirit and put it in another vessel it'll act the same way it'll behave the same way it'll do the same things said if you don't believe the words that I say believe the works because they testify of me and I believe that if God is tavern I gotta get in another vessel today you'll act the same way you'll still be doing the same works because the Bible says that these signs and wonders will follow them to believe all that all the different things that scripture talks of the attributes are exactly the same today as it was back then Jesus sense with him I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name there bear witness of me but you believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice said I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father cuz he knew who his father was and he was able to speak of him because he knew my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and then he said this famous statement that caused everybody to stumble I and my father are 100 now I had my father a 1 what what do you mean what are you talking about in John 8 25 28 then said they unto Him who art thou and jesus saith unto them even the same that I said unto you from the beginning I had many things to say in the judge of you but he that sent me is true see he knew where he came from and he knew where he was going and he knew his present responsibility he knew the past present and future he knew who it was that had sent him and who it was that had given him the revelation that he was speaking to them and he said and I speak to the world I speak to the world of those things which I have heard of him they understood not that he SPECT to them of the Father this had Jesus under them when you have lifted up the Son of man within ye shall know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me I speak these things my good imagine a man that had come that was standing there and and it's such a maturity that he knew his who his father was and that he knew the Bible so well and his father so well that he said I don't do nothing but that what's pleasing to the Father I don't do anything until first I see it first everything that he did everything that he was was was so encompassed in what the will of the Father was I only do that which is pleasing to the Father and let me tell you something that's how we got to get to get out of here you got to come to a place where everything that you do you have an understanding of who you are of your who your father is you know him and and I believe that if you know what you got to do what where you got to get to then that'll give you power there's so many people that today they don't have a direction in life they don't know what they're what they're here for whether what they're even if it's not revealed to you you know there's many things about the capstone that are not revealed to me yet but I could I could explain to you on paper what it is but it's like there it is I got to get to that I got to get to that place and when you know you got to get to it then well now you got your marching orders I think that's what if you look around at Natural Science today you can see all the time and expenditure that man has put into trying to get to the moon or getting to Mars and all that thing what if the church what if the bride had put that same amount of that of effort and to getting out of here that they were putting into going to Mars or whatever you know they're making t-shirts and all of those different kind of things you know brother Brown said he's waiting on the readiness of the bride he's waiting on you and I and you know what he's waiting on is for us to open the door and let Christ come into our heart let him change our vision let him take away the the crust over our eyes and put the put the eye salve of the word on us so that we can see clearly the word so that we can then look to the unseen and see what's beyond the veil of his flesh you see what what is pulling us from this world what is taking us from this world is the gospel that we have heard and that I'll take you now to get a new birth right there how do you get born again you know Adam had an impartation Peters it was just given to him but you and I we've been born as sins shapen in iniquity and so we've got to be born out of this world you've got to go through a process not just there it is which is what many people in the message believe about the new birth is that you just hear it is what are you seeking for you seeking for just a quick a feeling or something but are you seeking for power of transformation by the word that when the word is revealed to you it begins to take you from from a clothes and hair and dress to sanctified life to an in feeling where God the power of the Holy Ghost is within you and let me tell you something I don't believe that the church really knows the power of God that God when God fills you with the Holy Ghost he gives you power to cast out Devils he gives you power to live a godly holy life he gives you power to live this word came hardly talked I'll get I'll get to that in a second but what's drawing us from this world is the pull of the gospel in the seven churches back in 1954 brother Graham said my brother the other night receiving Christ he said don't ever push me bill said when God speaks to me I said you can't come until he calls you no man could have come to me except my father draws somebody does something else pulls you up that's somebody else but when God speaks you'll come see that's right standing there no man can come except my father draws you yeah I will think about this cuz that's really the secret just kidding out here how does he draw you how does he draw you is it a sensation or a feel under order remember larger hide in that cave and the whirlwind came by and all they did the earthquake and all those things but what attracted his attention what caused him to emerge from his little hidey-hole was that still small voice when he heard that still small voice of the words speaking and when you when God speaks to your heart and something nice within you and you say that's got to be the truth that's right it begins to draw you from the world from the things of this world to another world the revelation of the word is what's drawing you and I John 6 43 44 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man could have come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day and so that's what's creating the birth pains as as you're drawn from one place to another being born again by the incorruptible seed by the incorruptible Word of God being born again from from from places that plane to plane to higher plane as you grow up it's drawing you from this place to the next and so as you come from this world like like brother Brennan was preaching in why are we so tossed about if you've listened to that sermon why are we so talked about very interested in the way he brought it out as you go from the outer court to the inner court into the Holy of Holies the outer court where you got the Sun the light of the Sun of the Moon and it hides one say the clouds can come and cover it over and then you keep moving in to a higher plane of sanctification where where you've got the the seven golden candlesticks now look the way he expressed it because you know there's there's levels to the new birth seven golden candlesticks and we've got seven golden candlesticks down through the seven church ages seven golden candlesticks where it looks like now bring it back to your own personal journey you got a-you got times where you need to go borrow light from the neighbors the way he brought it you've got to go maybe this gets smoky in there and you got fan this the smoke out and get everything get everything clear again but then when you enter into the Holy of Holies and the veil drops behind you then you can partake of all the things that are within the Holy of Holies and it's like a child coming forth into another world now the problem is that that people stop there they come into another world and they think well now I'm born again I'm ready for the rapture I don't don't realize that there's a growth process don't realize that you've got to go beyond just just being born again but when you're born again this is something I brought out in the in the and I'm gonna expand on that a little bit more I know y'all waiting on me to do stage two though that of the trip throughout ur when you come forth when you come forth in that new birth process when any baby comes forth what the first thing that it sees the first thing that it sees in the natural is all of it the doctors and everything the MA the mama or whoever all all the people uh somebody was telling me about how they when they had a when they had their childhood they were playing rock music in there as they did the operation whatever and that's what in the natural a lot of people come forth to although all the things you know that the mama or whatever even in a lot of the whole there's old timing movies or whatever you see the like the Western dad pacing around outside he's nowhere to be seen nowhere to be found where is he but in the spiritual what's the first thing that you see what was the remember we're talking about when Jesus was born he came out knowing who his father was and when you're born of the gospel you know who your daddy is because that is the new birth a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you and that's where I Romans 8 says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry father the spirit of adoption where God has put you his spirit in you and that spirit is crying out for the word for more of the word and it's not a crying out like a baby and the natural cries out just like vain repetitions crying out not knowing what it speaks of but a baby in the gospel the only way what's the only way that you can get a hold of God's attention what's the only way that you can get God's attention is it with his sympathy appealing to how bad you feel or how how how down-and-out you are and seems like everybody else is doing so good and what about me that that won't turn God's attention if it would then he would have healed everybody there at the Pool of Bethesda if it would he would have had healed all the other blind beggars that were sitting alongside a blind Bartimaeus but the only way that you can get God's attention is by faith in His Word and so I believe that that's the way that you come forth crying Abba Father because Abba is a personal relationship a personal revelation to you of who God is and it might be just a baby form confession because in your baby form you don't have a full understanding like somebody that's adopted might might have an understanding but along your journey your confession is shaped your confession is molded and that's what this is all about is the words that come out of your mouth are shaped and molded until you come to speak in conditions which is what God is trying to get us to when the church comes to speaking conditions as what brother Aaron said back in 1954 I believe something like that then a hill didn't they'll come and Eden and what happened in Eden was Adam could come out and he could tell the mountain to go over there and tell the fog to roll back when the church comes to speaking conditions ask what you we'll and you shall have what you asked say to this mountain be moved and be cast into the sea and it'll be done and the thing is though that even in a baby form Christian all of that power is in there it's in there waiting to be manifested like an acorn that's planted in the ground that a that whole tree the oak tree is in that a corn it just needs to be manifested it just needs to go through a process for that acorn to grow and butt out with all the different things and so that's what I'm really getting to is when you come forth speak the word and I believe today so many Christians are afraid to speak the word or what if I say something what if I say something that doesn't happen what if you don't say something and you should have speak the word and it you know let me tell you let me be honest there's a lot of things in my private life that I am reticent to say in public because it would you know it causes all people start looking at you like you're somebody special whatnot but let me tell you something there is power in the spoken word if you want to see somebody healed or delivered speak it let it come out of your mouth speak it remember the Joshua did as they came over to Jericho they circle around the city and marched around 13 times and then they clash their lanterns and they shouted and what is a shout it's the Word of God coming forth from your lips that you believe what God has already spoken you're not saying your own words you're saying exist what God has already saying and the walls came tumbling down and if you want to see deliverance if you want to see the walls that are hindering your own growth in your own life your own spiritual life then speak and listen watch the walls come tumbling down and you see the way let me see if I can talk Lord stop screaming you see the way the way a baby and the gospel grows is it the father speaking and then you respond how are you responding your said I believe that that's nothing but the truth like Hattie Wright said you look at look at little Hedy right out of her old mouth and the deliverance are for a family whatever you say after she had said that's nothing but the truth and he said you speak it and she said let that my two boys fall down over my knees and give their heart to the Lord or however she said it and you know you go back into the Old Testament and looking out David a lot of these a lot of these Saints formulated their prayers and formulated their cries how Jonah in the belly of the whale and Daniel and Daniel 9 4 he said I pray and I made my confession how they formulated their conversation they used the word let let it come to pass let it be and they spoke and it was because the Word of God was in their mouth and now that Billy came those words and it came into a living reality because they were looking to the unseen unit the way that the church came into being on the day of Pentecost when that it came for minutes baby form now they that's let me say that right because the the ones that were in the upper room were all the way up here but the ones out on the street work came in - right there but the ones that were in the upper room they came out how did that how are they born they came out confessing who Jesus Christ is they came out proclaiming this is the one that you've killed and they came out speaking in the words that they spoke were so important in God's eyes that he wanted the ones from Cappadocia in Fritchie and all around the world to be able to understand the words that they spoke and so he changed the the way that it was that their tongues so that everybody could understand he gave everybody understanding of what they were speaking and they came forth speaking they came forth cry I put it like this they came forth crying Abba Father and that's the way the church has grown through Paul and Irene eosin Martin Columbo all the way up they cried as the word I knew a fresh fresh manner for that age was delivered to each messenger and he disseminated through all the ministers of that age they took up that cry and they began to cry to the people the ministers and the people picked it up and they began to cry I believe that and that's how the church has grown and that's how you grow as an individual by speaking the word upon your confession that's why he's the high priest of your confession he's the hyper he can't do anything until you first confess him you know the brother branham said there's this is really there's a lots of different ways that you can confess but at the end of a service he would say if you want to give you a heart to the Lord stand up on your feet and confess him and so they stood up on their feet many others would come to the offer and confess when you go down to the baptismal pool he said that's based upon your confession which is why he would say I now baptize you based upon your confession because they had spoken I believe what what the prophet has said what the Bible says I understand it and now I want to be baptized because I believe what has been spoken and that's my confession and so you your whole journey is based upon what you speak out of your mouth when you raise your hand in church and say I believe that when you when you stand on your feet and if you're in your private moment or or wherever you are that's your confession I believe God but you're confessing because you know who your daddy is and as the world opens up to you you know more and more and more and that's what's taking you from the world you're crying Abba Father just like a just like a baby cries out for that for that nourishing milk and that's why the Bible says that he's out out you know that's another thing that people have groped and pondered and what does else shadow I mean the breasted one the one that gives nourishment and you get your nourishment from the word you got you run to the word like like when David when they took when they kidnapped all of his why and took everything he had he said bring me the ephod because that's where he got his his nourishment from the word he got his his rejuvenation from the Word of God let me see where I am in my news in John chapter 14 I think this is number two on the on the notes back there Brooks jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you know me you should have known my father also and from his fourth he know him and I've seen him and they were like what cuz listen you've got to look with that inward eye with the spiritual eye of faith Philip say that him Lord show us the father and it suffice with us he was standing there right in front of him and yet they couldn't see him and the only way that you can see the father is by spiritual revelation jesus said that him have I been so long time with you and yet has thou not known me Philip he that has seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father you know there's a good illustration of the difference between the intellectual understanding and a revelation because until the new birth felt that the batteries and all ghosts fell on the day of Pentecost they were they would they could say you're the father and they were repeat words after he would say okay now now I got it but then on the day of crucifixion when they all ran in different directions and Peter was lapping people's ears off and everybody was running mass confusion and then on the road to Emmaus I didn't know who he was I thought he was a stranger they had no idea who he was but then on the day of Pentecost they knew who the father was that's the evidence of the new birth to you is when you know who God is when the word becomes a new book to you and you can look into it and see see things beyond just a very basic basic understanding because it begins to unfold you in layers like how brother Branham said the seven seals are like fireworks going off one goes off and then it spawns another and it just keeps unfolding like like that example of why we so tossed about where you go through the outer core inner core into the Holy of Holies but then he's got the man the the figure that he's talking about back in the outer court again what is going on because there's layers you see layers to redemption where you keep you go through this process of outer core inner core baptism of the Holy Ghost being born again all of the statute of a perfect man maybe I better stop on that one not stop but hold off for a little bit look you're you're born you're born by the word the way you're born again is by the word Galatians 3:11 says but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith and I think that's one of the things that the gospel does is to show you that the price has already been paid there's nothing you can do law the law won't help you keeping the law like that struggling within yourself to obey the law but let that let the lawgiver come in Tabernacle himself in you and then that's true justification the just shall live by faith and then own up to what the scripture that John Wesley preached in first Thessalonians 5:23 and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly holy whole sanctification complete sanctification and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ that right there is the power of transformation where God can take you a sinner and take you from the things of the world and transform you into a sanctified being born by the word and and then it becomes an experience to you not an experience like I felt something but an experience where you've lived something and I believe that's why a lot of people don't leave it in the in the if and and what the fivefold ministry today could do because they have never experienced it they've never allowed themselves to get into given given the word and opportunity sitting in a church sitting under a pastor sitting under ministry for the word to take effect in their life oh there's so many things that make up the new birth that comprised that experience that after you've gone through the outer core inner core Holy of Holies you can look back and say I've experienced all that and it's made a change it's wrong a change in me and now I know what it is because I've experienced it it's not just something that somebody has talked to me about but I know and the Bible says in Romans 10:17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God and so we know that's how you get the new birth is by hearing the word because that's how you get faith is when your intellectual hearing turns into real hearing and that produces faith and then you got the ball rolling when you say I know I you can feel that when you when you're up here speaking you know you kind of feel well this this is really basic and we've kind of all gone through this before but listen there's a lot of people that still need the basic and we've got we've got kids there's many different ones and all different walks of life some that had just just come to the message or whatever and so we're all struggling to get to the same place through these birth pains so hang on if I get a little bit basic or whatever so to speak and you know really if you think it's basic then maybe maybe you're the one that needs a little refresher course if you look down on the sincere milk of the milk of the gospel then maybe you're the one that needs to get that pacifier get that little bottle out and get some nourishment on the sincere milk of the word and that sounds ugly but maybe it's the truth so you've got to confess it first and I know that clocks winding around but just hang on with me for just a little bit cuz I I've just got another painter so knows let's look at number five yeah yeah which is believe it's Dow this in 1951 brother Graham talks about he might have been to every doctor there was in the city he told you there was no hope for you but even now our Lord whatever you ask God will do it and he's sitting at the right hand of the Father make intercession is upon his death burial and resurrection even now Lord whatever you ask God will do it and there he sits in His Majesty sitting by the side of the Father at the right hand of him up up there to make intercession upon anything that you ask him and confess that he's done it he'll confess it before the Father what more do you want say Lord I accept you as my healer say it say Lord I accept you as my healer I'll never say nothing else but what I'm healed from now on now that's a broad statement right there that's a big state I'll never say nothing else nothing else I remember that's one of the things that he wired why are people so tossed about he said when you get into the Holy of Holies all of the stuff that's going on outside doesn't impact you anymore because it could be raining outside but yet you're in there eating on that man I said I believe I'm healed I believe I'm gonna take a body change I believe it he's the same yesterday today and for every night influenced by whether or not the sun is shining other moons clouded over on all those things you're in there making your confession he can't do nothing for you to you first confess it he's the high priest of your confession in that case not even to your face and even couldn't be faith until you confess it you got to accept faith believe it and confess that it already is done and and I've got other quotes in here about how he conquered everything that the devil can't through against him by the word only by the word and how we we come forth we let's read this and in birth pain this is number eight I'm just going to skip through real quick he said it did that all down through the ages until finally the church delivered to them a man-child and that man child was the word self-made flesh in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he conquered every devil every power upon the earth they come against him with a father's word only every temptation that Satan give him he rebukes Satan not with his own powers that he had but with the Word of God it is written it is written it is written for he was the word and that's the same way that you defeat the devil is by bringing him the word that's the same way that you moved forward and the gospel is by confessing the word is by speaking it keep speaking it keep saying it and watch it come to pass when Satan flew against Eve she wasn't the word so it failed when he flew against Moses it did the same thing but we need hidden to the Son of God he was ten thousand volts it not gonna loose feathers out of him when he come back and said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God there was that man child made flesh God's eternal word Himself manifested in a body of flesh here on earth to represent the word that manchild made flesh and if you listen to the sermon the masterpiece you know that God is building another masterpiece not necessarily another masterpiece because it'll be the same word made flesh tabernacled again inside of people inside of you and I where did I put that quote mm I was tryna I can't find it right now but it was speaking on how that the church does not realize the power that lies within her if she realized what was inside of her that this spoken word can move mountains and all of those sorts of things but now let me let me just finish up here because remember what's drawing us no man could come under the Father no man can come to God except the father draws and so how is the father drawn us today he's drawn us by the gospel as the word is preached y'all hang on with me a little bit it's a little bit disconcerting for ministers when they see everybody starting to doze off see y'all hang on with me a little bit yo y'all go back and listen to the tape IRA erection hang on there with me just a little bit I know it's Wednesday night and everything but uh what's drawing us it's I'm just tell it what's drawing this is the gospel that we have preached and so to get us to get us out of here God has God sent something a little bit extra special for us as he's as he's as he's a messenger was pre he preached his message all the way up Oh what to Wesley and then we get to lay out of C and it seems like something's everybody's still in confusion in the denominational confusion and and but yet there's this child that needs to be born a man-child that needs to come into existence and the how is that gonna happen the only way that it can happen is for for God to send like a an emergency medical task force somebody to jump start with with those those electric paddles jumpstart that church and resurrect her bring her bring her up to her feet and would it what so what happened was he he sent a prophet to us a prophet which there was a little man who has a perfect conduit with all his flus open that God could get in here get in there and blast the word out like in that message looking to the unseen where he said we didn't brown even here anymore I'm using his lips I'm speaking through him I'm the one that raised up Christ from the grave and that's the kind of man that God said to jump-start the church and so that's what's pulling us that's what in 1st Thessalonians 4:15 that's what that's referring to when it said the Lord Himself will descent will shall descend from heaven with a shout the Lord Himself would come and get in that man where brother brother said I was looking down at myself speaking and somebody else was using his lips and speaking through him the Lord Himself descended in God in him and spoke through his lips with a shout shell from 1963 to 1965 a shout to pull us up out of the things that out of that denominational system so that we have understanding of where we're going and who our daddy is and so when that child is born after you've come through that outer court enter court into the Holy of Holies when that child was born you come out knowing who your father is you know who the father is and you know who you are and you could look back and see as the sails break to you through your own personal journey you can see how God has delivered you and you know that you have been delivered that God has justified you and sanctified you and Tabernacle himself and you and your confession has been shaped by the word and now you're not just speaking in a baby form but now you can speak in an adult form now the word can be spoken because you know what the word is you know what God wants done with the word and you have an understanding of those things excuse me being born again Peter said the first Peter being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth forever and ever which is what this process is about being born again so that the Word of God is in you that you can speak it and that's what the next part of that first Thessalonians are speaking of he descended with a shout with the voice of the Archangel which brother branham said was Christ and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first the dead in Christ have to rise first in other words the voice of Christ has to get them out of the ground the voice of Christ has to speak so that they will come from the ground so that the graves will open up and they'll be walking around among you and how will it be spoken it'll be spoken just like the Old Testament Saints where they said let let it come to pass we're brother and said in the rapture Mehsud he said now it's been spoken let it come to pass there'll be somebody standing here on the earth that has an understanding of what God wolves were done with the word that the word is Tabernacle in them and they'll say let the dead rise from the ground let the graves open let the dead walk around on the earth because the dead have to rise first so that we can go in the glory somebody was speaking somebody's will speak it and I might as well but you and I somebody's gonna speak it let the dead rise and so you see well you say well I can look around and I say well we got a lot of time left listen the doors are closing fast and if you haven't heard the message yet if you haven't opened the doors of your heart yeah you better run quickly because there's a people that's coming into a speaking condition there's people that are coming into a revelation of what God wants them to do with the word and you better get inside of the bride as quick as you can I'm sorry I know it's a little bit painful listen to my voice so my question is and I ask this in Sunday school my question is where where is the voice because there's that quote that brother Lewis read when he was ministering one I forget what sermon that was and I believe many of us all know it by heart that divorced somebody's got to be here on earth for God to speak through somebody's got to be here on earth and so there's always been down through the ages somebody for God to speak through Paul and Irina San Martin Columbia and Lutheran Wesley and brother branham the final messenger but now he's not on earth anymore and Jesus is not on earth anymore all of these are not on our own the earth anymore there's got to be somebody that he can speak through that somebody is you and I John 14 13 14 it says and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it anything in my name now there's our problem we might be like Hattie right sitting there and and and not quite believing Hattie right didn't what I'm saying are we not quite believe that he'll give us our children are we not quite believing like all the other ones in Egypt that came out of Egypt that God is able to deliver us the Giants into our hand remember there's only two one in me Joshua and Caleb that believed that they could take the land but if you can say God is able let's look at let's look at number 12 the oneness of unity don't tell me I'll get tired now come on the oneness of unity this was back in 1958 rise do you believe you're healed you believe that God answered prayer raise your hands to it thank you for it's over you're healed and I say brother I've never taught it to wait until you're healed and then thank you give him praise before he's done it lift up holy hands raising him and then walk into your confession watch it come to pass if you shall say what is it when you are out from Babylon you're out from under unbelief you're out from under superstitions you're out from under all these things and you're filled with God's own life yeah there's another stumbling block for us do you really believe that it's God's own life in you that God is tabernacling himself in your flesh and again I know it's Wednesday night but that's you that's it excite all of us to know that the god of glory the same way he was tackled in Jesus Christ although that was the fullness that that same ocean that same attributes is tabernacling you listen when when as a child comes into the world and the natural it makes everybody happy everybody starts calling one another and telling everybody I believe that's how it should be in the gospel as well when you see the child coming into fruition coming being born you start wanting to tell everybody about it you want that you want to let the world know that a child's been born your voice here's one get you your voice is his voice you are I spoke it that's what he said I spoke it see it's got to be spoken he's the shout spoken what the voice is talking about picked it up the people from 1963 onward we've been picking it up and accumulating it to ourselves and now I believe we're coming to a place where it can be spoken in my room awhile ago God told me to do this and here it is he's confirmed it right now amen and blessed be the name of the Lord oh what a time that's the first time this happened since South Africa how long will you grow up in unbelief the wind swept through this platform here just now as the Holy Spirit crossed over here the calls it was the spoken word of God that did there's power in the spoken word and that's what that masterpiece sermon is speaking of when at the end of it the sculpture is stricken and the master builder the master sculptor says speak now Michelangelo knew that that sculpture sculpture couldn't get up and start speaking and stuff but this is a different kind of sculpture this sculpture has been sculpted by the word until the master builder the master artist can look at it and see himself reflected in it it's got all of my attributes all of my makeup everything that makes me about myself is in this thing is in this masterpiece and so he strikes it and says speak that's what's happening now because I believe that I believe that God is at present to help a present he's a present God and that's why I'm struggling I'm trying not to keep putting him off in the future he's right here right now if you need if you have anything in need of anything tonight just reach up and claim it accept it accept your healing accept your deliverance if anything of this world has still got you shackled down and just accept it because it's not by your works it's not by by any kind of thing that you do but it's by grace that God is delivering us let me read here's that guy I don't think I gave this to the brothers in the back but this is the quote that I read in wool and what does that do they and there has to be human flesh on earth to speak his voice he said that in the voice of the sign in 1964 and I'm a clerk that musicians can go ahead and come forward because I'm a closed on this because when the when the disciples went to the Mount Transfiguration which is kind of the culmination type in Jesus's adoption as he went up there and and Moses and Elijah appeared on the Mount of Transfiguration and they went through all the different parts of the play there and they stood up there and and and it reads like this and Matthew chapter 17 if y'all want to pull this so this is number 13 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed him and behold a voice out of the cloud we said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear him hear him hear what he's got to say y'all come on and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and we're sore afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes what did they see this is what you see when you're born when you're born you see Jesus and you come forth crying Abba Father and there they were on the Mount of Transfiguration and what they saw was Jesus only no man we get our eyes on man so many times we look at brother Branham or your pastor or deacons or all these different figures in the end the message great men and the messages these days and we've all done it but when when you come forth you see no man save Jesus only and as they came down for the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the day and the Son of Man is rising right now amen let's stand to our feet and we'll just go to the Lord in prayer and I'll close the service I want to ask you a question if you just lift your hand up if you believe that the voice of God is in his bride amen and after all those quotes that I've read how could you doubt it God's got to have somebody that could be his voice and you are that voice if you open the door to your heart study read let him come in so they he'll do the speaking for you that's how the Galatians Galatians chapter 2 we live by the faith of the Son of God his faith his works his actions in our lives so if you have it if you have any needs as we go to prayer you know you don't even have to lift your hand just believe that God is able to deliver that able to give you what you have needed that's what the Bible says if you ask ask anything he'll do it ask it according to his word if you come quoting the word and laying the word before them and say you promised it watch it come to pass so let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God I thank you God so much for your grace to us tonight Lord and for your grace to me helping my voice tonight Lord Jesus God I really didn't know how all the notes and things that I had would be ordered tonight Lord but I believe that you put everything in the right order the Lord I want you to put the order in the people's hearts Lord Jesus and maybe they go back tonight Lord Jesus and that you will bring things that are remembrance since they is they open their Bible and studying your word to the weak Lord God and I pray God that you'll continue to quicken your word Lord Jesus and I believe Lord God that the the hour has come Lord with a bride is beginning to realize who she is she knows who she is and where she came from and where she's going and she's having a higher elevated understanding of the things that have been written and sealed up through all these years and now we've come to a place Lord where we know what's going on and so now Lord Jesus we can speak your word and say Lord now let it come to pass Lord Jesus let let your word to come to pass Lord God if there's any here that are still struggling Oh Lord God I pray Lord that you let it come to pass Lord that you break all the change of the earth Lord break give them deliverance Lord God because you are our deliverer just as you deliver the children of Israel from Egypt Lord you're still delivering safes today Lord God and I pray O God that you'll answer ever need Lord God ever every struggle every strike trial Lord that we're going through the Lord Jesus come upon the scene for your people Lord God we ask you Lord God that you bring salvation to the Lost the ones Lord Jesus that Lord that are struggling to open up the door to their heart Lord God granted I pray Lord that you'll keep knocking not good God because you you said Lord a no man can come to me except the father draw them and I pray O God to continue to draw Lord Jesus Lord bless all the ones that law that are here
