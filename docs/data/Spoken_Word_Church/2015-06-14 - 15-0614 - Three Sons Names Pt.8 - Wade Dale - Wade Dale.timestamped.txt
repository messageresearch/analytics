[0:00] hi brother Finn about to be in the
[0:02] center
[0:03] this message is Seneca of the home of
[0:08] everything that stack your perfect man
[0:17] next week in anybody and he may got the
[0:22] the table on their on their iPad you see
[0:28] it change and change last week but the
[0:32] drive time I can't even different here
[0:35] are there and everything about a change
[0:40] click over here that's all all different
[0:43] than what it was before and then you
[0:45] don't have to go anywhere else you get
[0:46] your audio you can smack that so you can
[0:50] listen you can listen to it
[1:03] Oh
[1:06] yep a little bit um hi let's go back to
[1:11] our scripture to love John one
[1:24] one
[1:26] in the beginning was the word world with
[1:28] god and the word love God saying with in
[1:31] the beginning with God all things were
[1:35] made by him what the word okay and
[1:41] without him was not anything made that
[1:43] was made and it was life in life with a
[1:45] lot of men now that like Moses saw that
[1:54] light in a burning books right right
[1:58] then we see that Abraham Abraham I don't
[2:03] he didn't see God except in the
[2:06] Melchizedek ok he talked with God all
[2:11] right but watch how God is condescending
[2:13] down because the Bible says many times
[2:15] it says I've come down i'll come down
[2:21] just the look I've come down to look
[2:24] I've come down like Melchizedek did we
[2:26] leave him he said I've come down to look
[2:29] we didn't have to come down and go look
[2:30] at this ends of Sodom his presence you
[2:35] got after the presence of the almighty
[2:37] is what condemned saw them in tomorrow
[2:39] right he sent the two messengers down to
[2:43] Sado to try to call people out brother
[2:45] Graham said Billy Graham for Robert send
[2:48] him down there to call out of people out
[2:50] of Sodom right but there was a man that
[2:53] stayed there with Abraham call Mel
[2:55] Cassidy and when did he do he's the one
[3:01] that tongue
[3:11] which then you got to tag these things
[3:13] without our tango which to give you
[3:16] don't I tag along him for you tag
[3:18] scripture still learning they're ok
[3:21] we'll just still learn together
[3:29] do it goodbye the Tim him read this
[3:34] friday night with you which is really
[3:35] good let's go down to verse 17 wherein
[3:41] god willing more abundantly to show them
[3:43] to the heirs of promise now who is the
[3:45] heirs of promise that's us we you said
[3:50] all know we're all right go go same
[3:56] place let's go right here let's prove
[4:02] this is this is the Hall of faith right
[4:04] but what's this what's what the Bible
[4:06] says look at verse 39 and these all who
[4:13] all that Old Testament Moses you don't
[4:17] list Elijah but Moses Elijah Isaiah
[4:20] Isaac Jacob everybody this is Tom like
[4:24] the Old Testament right Hebrews 11 is
[4:26] talking about the fade that was in the
[4:28] old testament and these all having
[4:31] obtained a good report through faith
[4:34] received not the promise all right so
[4:39] they didn't receive the promise sure I
[4:42] even have got a promise and he did stand
[4:45] on the promised land but remember it
[4:49] wasn't revealed to it because watch what
[4:51] brother Brad said brother Graham said on
[4:52] the exact spot where male calves making
[4:54] out of Abraham is where that you see is
[4:57] going to push up Abraham was literally
[4:58] walk in on that city that he was looking
[5:01] for the city of who build and legs were
[5:03] done if he would have had that I side of
[5:06] Revelation like we have now because he
[5:10] have enough revelation to know that man
[5:11] was God but to look down and and
[5:15] Melchizedek say you looking for a city
[5:18] in these dear
[5:19] murphy's and stand early you're standing
[5:21] right on the peak of it is right down
[5:24] below your feet and one day when time
[5:27] comes it's going to push up now that's
[5:30] not a coincidence that's a revelation
[5:33] that Melchizedek met Abraham because one
[5:36] is it Abraham etapa the true believer
[5:38] the true believer and God Almighty and
[5:40] human flesh together right but now there
[5:44] was no way that that promise could go
[5:47] into Abraham right the promises in eburg
[5:51] that's the hope the promise the promise
[5:54] that we had was what what was the
[5:56] promise let's go to Genesis find out
[6:01] ones promises this is 315 to me that is
[6:09] the promise that is the way back through
[6:16] Redemption he said I'll God said I will
[6:20] put enmity between thee and the woman
[6:22] and between thy seed and her seed
[6:23] remember she doesn't woman doesn't have
[6:25] a seat it has to be given a seat so what
[6:28] is that see Christ whose I talking about
[6:31] that right to me that once cookie time I
[6:33] jensen's 126 sure that shows my birth
[6:35] but Genesis previa thing shows my coming
[6:40] forth on my Redemption that's the
[6:43] redemption scripture to me he said well
[6:45] I don't let them at that looks kind of
[6:47] really what does it say it you can't
[6:50] here's what it's saying here's the
[6:52] essence of first big thing Adam you
[6:56] thought you can do it no if you thought
[6:59] you could do it first Adam you thought
[7:01] you could do a you an out God who come
[7:03] back he said I'll honor that he said
[7:06] because that's what I'm gonna do I'm
[7:07] going to go out and get my bride and
[7:09] bring her back she committed adultery
[7:11] right man
[7:14] output empty so in other words I will to
[7:17] me that starts the whole thing right
[7:19] there I will I will I will I will forget
[7:24] your chemistry I will absolutely yes we
[7:39] were born between Satan II Adolphus
[7:42] parents so that one that make us we have
[7:44] to be made virgin by the blood of Jesus
[7:46] Christ man we have to be made a virgin
[7:50] we're not where we're born in San shapen
[7:52] in iniquity I like young brother Tim
[7:56] brought in some of that about a while
[7:58] what happened is it you know remember in
[8:01] Deuteronomy or numbers he talks about
[8:03] talks about bowing about but it also
[8:05] talks about it but maiden goes out and
[8:07] she's in a city and she's getting ready
[8:09] to be defiled if she screams out someone
[8:14] help me then sheep that's not carried to
[8:16] her that's exactly what we did that's
[8:20] exactly what we did we were being taken
[8:23] over by the devil we screamed out father
[8:27] help me and you know what that's not
[8:31] caring to her virginity right and that's
[8:33] what the box said it's not counting for
[8:34] her well see that's the way we are and
[8:36] you know you have to look in you get in
[8:39] the Old Testament you say well what if
[8:41] you're committed adultery you're you're
[8:43] on the take them all out stone David Lee
[8:49] read over there well there was someone
[8:51] don't be going on in and then times and
[8:53] they weren't stoned or killed there were
[8:55] some grace in there somewhere right I
[8:58] same way we need you but I will put
[9:01] enmity no words what does he have a key
[9:03] division I've got to put a division
[9:06] between the what the servants of Satan
[9:09] and the one that was the one
[9:12] moments of church I sighs so I'm going
[9:16] to have to put enmity because if I don't
[9:19] separate myself there will be no act of
[9:22] redemption that's what I see in this
[9:25] picture i see there's no act of
[9:27] redemption if we're all still together
[9:29] right I'll put enmity God said I'm not
[9:34] going to be in other words i'm not going
[9:37] to be able to come down as this man
[9:42] right because brother Graham said Jesus
[9:46] this body would have come to eat so
[9:50] cheap that he would have had the body
[9:51] Jesus would have served one tool oh gosh
[9:53] with a stepped in he's always been named
[9:55] Jesus I got a few quotes when they real
[9:58] he's always been Jesus Christ oh Jesus
[10:00] Christ same yesterday today forever
[10:01] Jesus Christ created all things that
[10:04] word Jesus just didn't develop until he
[10:06] came on earth that was a dirty name all
[10:09] right and you know what differentiates
[10:11] him that's why we've got time for name
[10:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ cover as many
[10:17] Jesuses they playing issues is in them
[10:19] did you know that that Barabbas was
[10:21] first name was Jesus rendang history
[10:23] just the other day brabus his first name
[10:26] was Jesus so there was to Jesus is
[10:28] standing there man took morales and then
[10:33] they brought us Jesus Perales and then
[10:35] Jesus Christ couple of a cross but i
[10:38] will put enmity so God said I'm going to
[10:40] have I can't come down in the cool of
[10:42] the day anymore you have sense so I'm
[10:44] going to put a division between me and
[10:46] you by and between thy seed and her seed
[10:52] by same and the woman so so let's look
[10:57] at this and remember one thing he's not
[10:59] talking about natural seed to me and you
[11:03] there's like bro down said I don't care
[11:06] about me if I was if I was the Beast son
[11:10] don't bother me one bit and then doesn't
[11:14] bother me one bit no I don't do this is
[11:17] not talking about
[11:18] sure sure there have to be a natural
[11:20] seed division but remember there was
[11:25] looks like he said well there's a
[11:26] natural seed division when now Cain and
[11:28] Abel live together for a long time grew
[11:32] up together and then came did what he
[11:35] did and there was a separation so it
[11:37] wasn't that God said well I'm kicking
[11:39] I'm kicking came out you know keeping
[11:42] able no they both come out the same
[11:44] wound they both grew up together and
[11:47] then they made their decision in the
[11:51] process of coming to the age of
[11:52] accountability then they made their own
[11:56] division all right I will put enmity
[11:59] between by the end of one eye so there's
[12:02] going to be the empty between Satan and
[12:04] the church or Satan and woman between
[12:08] thy seed and her seed now remember she
[12:10] don't have a seat so there has to be
[12:11] that Steve was new Jesus Christ she had
[12:15] to be given a seat so here's it shows me
[12:18] God and Jesus Christ and then right
[12:22] here's the finality this is right before
[12:24] we go into the future home Satan now
[12:28] look and it shall bruise thy head did
[12:30] you talk to come to the safe home to
[12:32] saving right he's talking to the devil
[12:34] he's not talking to the servant he's not
[12:38] holding the beach that beast is just
[12:40] going I did I did well I did a little
[12:44] natural yeah i mean really ought to feel
[12:46] like i was doing when I told you know
[12:50] but remember he had no way to reason so
[12:53] it was the devil talking through through
[12:56] the Beast ok what's the devil speaking
[12:58] to the be so God's not speaking to them
[13:01] to the beach he's talking to same
[13:04] alright but when he vicariously used to
[13:07] beast he knew is one thing for sure
[13:08] that's kind of what what gets me is in
[13:11] the end time now what is it it's going
[13:13] to be an obese vicariously Satan's going
[13:18] to enter that code or the Beast to
[13:21] finish this thing off it started with a
[13:23] beast incarnate Satan incarnate obese is
[13:26] going to end
[13:26] saving her nana be all right so that's
[13:28] what this is it shall bruise thy head
[13:30] now if you hit somebody the head you
[13:32] kill but then what rock what's this
[13:35] right here here is my body redemption go
[13:43] ahead and thou Satan shall prove his who
[13:48] whose head see you want Jesus Christ
[13:52] when he was on the cross remember we
[13:56] preached the sermon on beat print foot
[13:57] foot means Redemption where's the heel
[14:00] heel Donna but Jesus Christ was struck
[14:06] for our redemption right never he was
[14:12] dropped on a cross what he didn't he
[14:16] took on e brood he was bruised for a
[14:19] mine iniquity all the Isaiah 53 so the
[14:22] meeting I hope I that brief 15 just
[14:24] humming though Genesis pre-clear theme
[14:26] to show the whole plan of redemption
[14:28] because first class got to separate from
[14:30] if not then there's no redemption don't
[14:32] remember redemptions not replaceable
[14:34] redemption is God and man we've talked
[14:37] about a god man Andy right here together
[14:38] they're talking in the garden there's no
[14:41] fear there's no enmity oh I can walk in
[14:44] the garden Adam would actually
[14:46] finding actually you know they go
[14:47] through the garden brother Brian said
[14:49] many times it that they would walk
[14:51] through the garden and they would feel
[14:52] the pull they would feel the spirit
[14:55] right so they would go to God and they
[14:57] say indeed safe house my children today
[14:59] and all that you know an old house
[15:01] everything going in said he would lay
[15:03] him down and food and sleep why because
[15:06] their body with actually being renewed
[15:08] they had a human body so they had to
[15:10] rest a little uh no because remember
[15:12] what Mady turn all right our bodies are
[15:16] not eternal to we get there Jesus Christ
[15:18] you'll want to have an eternal body
[15:20] flesh body that once was that's why the
[15:23] Bible talks specifically specifically
[15:26] about Mortal to immortal that were
[15:30] immortal means you were mortal one time
[15:33] now you're more because remember angels
[15:36] cannot be more can that's why there's no
[15:38] redemption to angel there's no
[15:41] redemption because there's no mortal and
[15:43] anymore you and I everybody from adam to
[15:47] today not us dying what mortality that's
[15:53] why they call it mortality rate right
[15:56] because we're mortal but there's only
[16:00] one man that's becoming immortal he said
[16:04] well what about Hannah I don't
[16:06] understand that I was going to leave
[16:07] that alone the Bible says one has went
[16:10] to immortality Jesus Christ that means
[16:13] he had a mortal flesh body something
[16:15] happened he died he was changed and now
[16:20] he has an immortal body once that flesh
[16:23] was mortal now say more little in one
[16:25] man
[16:25] that lets Jesus Christ well that's
[16:27] that's where he's going to bruce saving
[16:29] he's going to hit him right in the head
[16:31] kill him but he had to be bruised for us
[16:35] to me that's the that takes the sin he
[16:39] took the sin he took the sin upon
[16:40] himself so ever happens that you see
[16:43] that scripture the tumescent utiful God
[16:45] had to put enmity and then write down
[16:47] here he what he do he puts on man back
[16:49] together again I in flesh all right
[16:54] inflation because you got to remember
[16:57] the Genesis 126 man I hope you see that
[17:00] that jess is 126 man never felt never
[17:04] never never had to be never had to be
[17:11] accused of sin I was a member of you
[17:14] ever accused us in your Sarah that
[17:17] Genesis 1 26 men never sinned he doesn't
[17:20] matter and you say well that's a paradox
[17:22] that if that juice is 136 barrels in
[17:25] Adam and you see what he did I
[17:26] tendencies 1.6 man was indeed and you
[17:29] see what she did because when that
[17:31] collision took over hey that's our
[17:34] problem now my mother's been trying to
[17:37] get us to see if we see that that soul
[17:39] inside of us is the eternal as God is
[17:42] never said today never committed
[17:45] adultery never said a bad word never had
[17:48] a bad fall when I that's in you
[17:51] somewhere our problem is when I let it
[17:54] live out we have built the cocoon around
[17:57] it called sin and Carl line dinner what
[18:01] enmity okay kind of getting off from
[18:05] messaging a little bit but I hope this
[18:07] helps you something but it still it's
[18:09] all the logos it's all and I hope you
[18:14] see this program brother they'll come
[18:18] back the apne and Holy Spirit not we
[18:20] know that's the soul of man when you're
[18:23] going again that same one that created
[18:25] the earth is inside you that's hard to
[18:31] believe but we don't have to start
[18:33] believing that that's been man's problem
[18:35] coming down through time they sit all
[18:39] the way away come on people this endtime
[18:44] people are the only people that's going
[18:47] to get a revelation that what we say is
[18:49] what's going to happen what we say is
[18:56] what's going to happen right the Bible
[18:58] says you say to this mountain right not
[19:04] even the staff the Lord treat this is
[19:06] what I see about your brother Graham
[19:07] said the bride will help us that the
[19:10] Lord and be still well now you have to
[19:12] move through that to me that's a
[19:14] revelation you have to come up through
[19:15] the save the Lord the brother Graham
[19:17] said it wasn't the staff of the Lord
[19:19] when the squirrels were were created
[19:22] there told us that the Lord because when
[19:24] you say just after Lord what you're
[19:26] doing is you're saying what somebody up
[19:27] said Jesus didn't say what somebody else
[19:32] said he said I only say what the father
[19:34] tells me you know a worse day one he
[19:37] didn't have another thought and that's
[19:40] the problem with us we have another
[19:41] thought because of this that's where we
[19:44] have another thought that's why Jeep
[19:45] that's why God had said i will put in
[19:48] with you so if he put the enmity there
[19:50] he's the one that's going to have to
[19:52] bring it back together see that st.
[19:55] didn't put the enmity there I will put
[19:58] enmity so he put the division for
[20:03] redemption right hey now through the
[20:09] need what the word Christ it's all going
[20:13] to come right back together all right
[20:14] and it did on a cross brother I'm said
[20:17] everything was finished at counting
[20:19] everything he said even Israel was saved
[20:24] at Calvary he said but it's not going to
[20:25] be applied to them till we get into the
[20:28] Millennium so you see how long that's
[20:30] going to take it was all done in Calgary
[20:32] for us those three days everything that
[20:37] barrel resurrection is what we're facing
[20:40] death to ourself burial to ourselves and
[20:45] what a resurrection that's the next
[20:47] thing coming is the resurrection dr.
[20:49] buddy change or interaction we got to
[20:51] give them up out of the ground Jesus
[20:52] told Lazarus I like my brother Tim I
[20:55] really enjoy parts of what he said most
[20:58] of what he said but you I said yeah be
[21:00] careful and just watch and you know take
[21:03] what you can take I really like that law
[21:05] of exchange that's really good I enjoyed
[21:08] that the law of exchange tells you a lot
[21:12] that's what we're talking about Jesus
[21:15] exchanged his life to give to put this
[21:20] enmity back together he had to come down
[21:22] and human flesh this hill is on a human
[21:25] being got it this heel was on a human
[21:29] person called through Jesus Christ but
[21:31] he couldn't do it here you couldn't do
[21:33] it here you couldn't do it here you
[21:34] couldn't do it here he couldn't do it
[21:36] here there's a promise had come here
[21:39] what was the promise i will put enmity
[21:42] but i will restore right so in the
[21:47] restoration listen let me let me let me
[21:50] get something full restoration it's not
[21:53] under the Son of God
[21:57] it's the son of god in the Son of Man
[21:59] yeah but the Son of Man is work for
[22:02] restoration this is not this sure who
[22:05] was Jesus gives what something Yeah
[22:07] right the Son of God let's get this
[22:11] today and then we'll make footwear right
[22:13] here the Son of God is a spirit in how
[22:16] the team whatever he wants didn't have
[22:18] it all right if I got that inhabit him
[22:21] whatever he wants to have it so then
[22:23] what we're going to talk about today but
[22:26] with gaga we get off subject but it's
[22:28] still part of its building the
[22:30] foundation son of God is the logos which
[22:34] is the word and prefigure Jesus cried
[22:37] close to the Christ the Anointed I am
[22:40] his the oppening Holy Spirit angel of
[22:43] Covenant now brother Graham said it's
[22:44] the angel of the Covenant that was that
[22:47] angel was inside that burning bush who
[22:50] was it a separate person I was Jesus
[22:53] Christ talking to Moses because remember
[22:56] jesus said before Abraham was well
[22:59] Abraham was before Moses right remember
[23:04] it was Abraham then they got put 400
[23:07] years in captivity never deliver
[23:08] emotions came so jesus said before ever
[23:11] why he's gift all the way over before
[23:13] Abraham was I am before Abraham don't
[23:17] know where he was telling them whatever
[23:19] happened during that time I was right
[23:21] there and he could if he could put on
[23:26] putting my own words Jesus I know this
[23:30] is what he said many times if I wasn't
[23:32] limited with this
[23:33] woman body takes a lot of things I can
[23:36] do but remember he limited himself to
[23:39] that human body so he could what put it
[23:42] back together he had to put it back
[23:43] together in human flesh you have to put
[23:47] it back together the desert sun god
[23:49] they're worse in purity holy eternal
[23:52] never Santana his life same way with
[23:56] hear hear anything wrong with the Holy
[23:58] Spirit can't they roll that angel coated
[24:01] the captain of the host know what about
[24:04] a man that was so real that Joshua the
[24:07] warrior he was Joshua comes up from a
[24:11] battle one day I'm sure he's all hyped
[24:13] up coming he's he's a natural Orion sure
[24:16] we tied him in spirituality as the holy
[24:19] spirit but he's the next he's a natural
[24:21] warrior he was born but in the land
[24:25] right Moses went mortify the land
[24:28] remember Joshua's want to come over
[24:30] right which is a type of Christ with the
[24:33] Holy Spirit but here's here's a Joshua
[24:38] with his adrenaline flowing and he's
[24:40] coming out of a battle and he walks up
[24:42] and he sees this trans guy standing
[24:44] there they probably don't have on the
[24:45] armor like his or armor like even the
[24:48] end of him he's like who are you I tell
[24:51] i'm at joshua's out who are you what's
[24:54] your name and when he opened his mouth
[24:57] though and told and identified gosh you
[25:00] up I'm the captain of the hope and I've
[25:03] come to take over now what did Joshua do
[25:08] Joshua did just like Moses if you read
[25:10] the Bible wish I could find him I can't
[25:13] find it with this I got a mother regular
[25:15] Bobby but what did he do he bowed down
[25:18] to off his shoes for the ground he was
[25:23] standing on
[25:24] just like Moses mad well see here comes
[25:27] the burning bush where Moses didn't see
[25:29] a man then Moses saw the back part of a
[25:31] man then Joshua the one set to really
[25:36] take over because remember Moses is like
[25:38] the profit that brings you up to the
[25:40] promised land through the right but no
[25:43] prophet says thus saith the Lord he says
[25:47] what God says he says what somebody else
[25:49] tells him to say Joshua when he got into
[25:53] the land he said all right we're going
[25:55] to buy this one this one this one this
[25:57] one you go this way some of you stay
[25:59] here after you try was going to stay
[26:00] here some of you gonna what was Joshua
[26:02] when he was the leader or the Holy
[26:04] Spirit after you get into promised land
[26:07] the probably it brings you to the
[26:09] promised land Joshua takes you in the
[26:11] promised land which Joshua is a type of
[26:14] the one the Holy Spirit but when Joshua
[26:17] comes up and makes a meet the man I
[26:20] believe you become a little bit
[26:22] different it become a little bit
[26:24] different person when you met me kept
[26:25] lose that count of the hope i believe it
[26:28] was God in human flesh he just done the
[26:29] same thing you did with Mel cassadaga he
[26:32] just throat a body together stepped in
[26:34] it and Joshua being a warrior remember
[26:38] God has to meet us sometimes the way we
[26:42] don't the only way we can see right
[26:48] Ezekiel probably when he had that vision
[26:52] memory had a vision of a man he was
[26:56] describing from here to here he was from
[26:59] here to here he call the description but
[27:01] what was the finality one Ezekiel saw
[27:03] will the middle with right so that's his
[27:07] revelation of what Jesus was and then
[27:09] when brother Graham says Jesus goes down
[27:11] to paradise to pick them up and Abraham
[27:16] said hey Sarah that's the one we fetid
[27:18] calf to as he he said is easy i love the
[27:22] way things if you looked over Abraham's
[27:23] children see that's a wheel
[27:25] what was it it was Jesus it was the
[27:28] Opera nygaard standing there the young
[27:31] man that they hadn't met all the way
[27:33] down through here okay so and then the
[27:36] angel the Covenant the pillar of fire
[27:38] that led the children of Israel my
[27:40] brother branham he brings this to the
[27:43] halo over his head and many times in the
[27:47] prayer line he said he's no more than
[27:49] two feet from us right now but he wasn't
[27:51] a man standing there it plugged him he
[27:55] had went back to the hill was the angel
[27:57] the Covenant he said this is the same
[27:58] woman he said it's Jesus Christ will
[28:01] read it next honey well i'll bring the
[28:02] quote from will read them that sunday
[28:04] but he said it's the Angel of the
[28:06] Covenant that letter children to Israel
[28:08] and that struck Paul down see the scene
[28:12] of Revelation now what happens if we got
[28:14] when we get to the Sun man we're going
[28:16] to divide this thing out because the son
[28:18] of man can't come back the little person
[28:22] to the Millennium oh my god that Jesus
[28:27] Christ himself the immortal God cannot
[28:30] walk that's not even what was so
[28:32] wonderful about him on Jesus when my
[28:34] brother Prem saw the vision of Jesus
[28:37] never saw him right he was three to four
[28:42] feet off the ground see that would have
[28:45] broke see if brethren would have saw him
[28:47] standing on the earth I believe that
[28:49] holy spirit inside of him would have
[28:51] said like who was it that through the
[28:52] inkwell and it's saving you know I said
[28:55] the guy walks him with a crown on his
[28:56] head is that I'm Jesus and said the holy
[28:59] spirit inside whoever was Wesley or
[29:01] whoever water no one had Marvin Martin
[29:04] he said they're riding and he looks and
[29:06] you know what most of us would have said
[29:09] old praise god there's Jesus but now
[29:11] something inside of him said hold on
[29:14] hold on a minute there's something wrong
[29:16] about this picture we're supposed to
[29:18] crown you later than this you're not
[29:21] supposed out
[29:22] on your head right now joyfully well
[29:24] lady once they get behind me Satan right
[29:27] same way with all these we must see that
[29:30] that God when he shows his self you have
[29:33] to be careful number one Satan can
[29:36] impersonate and be so close that's
[29:39] what's happening now it's so close yeah
[29:42] but the angel of the Covenant went all
[29:45] that's why I say about some man so the
[29:47] liberal son of man the body of Jesus
[29:49] can't come to the earth until the
[29:51] Millennium okay but that's why that we
[29:55] have to cover some man because the Son
[29:58] of Man is what's right now this is the
[30:01] Son of Man revelation what the God can
[30:04] live in human flesh again like he did in
[30:08] the Garden of Eden it's like you didn't
[30:11] garner be right remember Adam was
[30:15] walking through the garden of eden with
[30:17] a flesh body but he wasn't in trouble
[30:18] yet right when we realize that I think
[30:24] that's what we're going to be changed
[30:25] but here's your we're going to we're
[30:29] going to probably next Sunday jump over
[30:31] into the son of man for a minute but
[30:33] remember excuse me if you look at
[30:36] Ezekiel Ezekiel keep saying son of man
[30:39] prophesied son of man promised up now
[30:42] what's he talking about he's talking
[30:43] about that man because let's just be
[30:47] realized
[30:50] and what's called son of God right he
[30:53] was the only Son of God in the Old
[30:54] Testament right cuz he had what he had
[30:57] the promise and it's all the promise was
[31:00] I'm going to live in you your wife
[31:03] children the juice is 126 is the promise
[31:05] to me that's components this is the
[31:08] redemption promise Genesis 1 26 shows
[31:11] that were the children of God this shows
[31:13] how we're going to get back to that ok
[31:17] give me so the Son of Man revelation is
[31:21] going to be what the Son of God in human
[31:25] flesh now it was the son of God in human
[31:29] flesh in Paul's day right right it was
[31:35] the son of God in human flesh and Paul's
[31:36] name but there was no revelation of the
[31:38] Son of Man even the great Apostle Paul
[31:40] never said a word about its own man okay
[31:43] but they have a revelation that God was
[31:47] living in their heart literally living
[31:50] in their heart but there was things in
[31:54] mound and we will talk about that later
[31:55] on so let's come some God's Spirit God
[31:59] always remember that
[32:03] you
