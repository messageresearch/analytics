[19:33] ever true as our brother comes this
[19:37] morning you know one of my favorite
[19:39] quotes I heard brother brandham say he
[19:43] said as you receive the word you become
[19:46] the word sounds very simple sometimes
[19:49] but it can be very
[19:51] tough take some dying out to take some
[19:54] Letting Go receiving embracing and
[19:58] believing
[19:59] but it's possible because as his word
[20:01] comes forth this morning say Lord let it
[20:04] be a revelation to me that's what faith
[20:06] is is a revelation to our hearts and I'm
[20:09] thankful for the word of Goden another
[20:12] thing I remember brother uh Billy Paul
[20:14] telling uh what brother bham said it's
[20:16] not in a quote but it was in one of his
[20:18] testimony he said the Bible is the only
[20:21] book in the world that the author is
[20:23] there to reveal it as you read it think
[20:26] about that all the other authors are out
[20:28] out on their yachts and we're paying for
[20:30] their bills and stuff but the Bible is
[20:32] free and he's there to reveal it so
[20:36] wonderful who could think of something
[20:38] like that so as the word come forth he's
[20:41] there just take it receive it say I
[20:43] believe it and he'll Quicken it to you
[20:46] amen holy
[20:49] words long

[31:38] we we love the Lord and we love we love
[31:41] people we love all of you let's go to
[31:43] the Book of Psalms what we're going to
[31:44] do today is we've been speaking for
[31:46] those of you that are that are new we've
[31:47] been speaking for now a year on the son
[31:50] of man Ministry and now we've come into
[31:53] the transition from from as we say from
[31:56] brother brandham and his healing
[31:57] campaign
[31:58] into the opening of the word which is
[32:01] the seals and the different things and
[32:02] the mysteries of God we believe in the
[32:04] Mysteries we believe if the book's open
[32:06] we can read
[32:08] it if brother Brown preached it so can
[32:10] we that's what he did it for he give it
[32:13] to us to preach and to break it down to
[32:16] the people so uh let's turn to the Book
[32:18] of Psalms real quick and then I'll let
[32:20] you be seated dear heavenly father thank
[32:21] you for the day that you give us thank
[32:23] you for each person here Lord I pray
[32:25] that you'd anoint each one of us Lord to
[32:27] hear from you
[32:28] Lord that you would be the active
[32:29] participant in this service Lord you do
[32:31] the speaking Lord may we do the hearing
[32:34] father bless the ones that are sick that
[32:36] are not here Lord we have several that
[32:37] are out sick I pray that you touch their
[32:39] bodies Lord we we have some that are

[32:43] days Lord I pray that you'd be with them
[32:44] Lord be with our watch Night Service be
[32:47] with brother Andrew Glover Lord as he
[32:48] comes and ministers for us and then just

[32:53] up Lord if you T Lord we'll be here
[32:55] father and if we not we're going to to
[32:57] be home and we'll be just a happy bunch
[32:59] of people so father just be with us now
[33:02] forgive us of our sins and many mistakes
[33:04] Lord in Jesus name we pray amen The Book
[33:07] of Psalms is the words of the Lord are
[33:09] pure words as silver tried in a furnace
[33:12] of Earth now what we're going to do
[33:13] today is purified seven times so we know
[33:16] that number seven is completion and that
[33:19] completes the work we know we're in the
[33:20] seventh Church age all right everybody
[33:23] with me we're in the seventh Church age
[33:25] we've had a seventh angel messenger he's
[33:27] he's brought his message he has went off
[33:30] the scene he did not take the Holy Ghost
[33:32] with him he did not take the word with
[33:34] him he left that for us Amen to be the
[33:38] final voice to the final
[33:40] age verse seven Thou shalt keep them oh
[33:43] Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this
[33:47] generation
[33:49] forever this generation forever Matthew
[33:53] 17
[33:54] ver9 as they came down from the mountain
[33:56] remember this is a Mount Transfiguration
[33:59] where Jesus was um he Shone like a light
[34:03] and Moses and Elijah showed up and and a
[34:05] voice come and said this is my beloved
[34:07] Son hear ye himm and as they came down
[34:09] from the mountain Jesus charged him
[34:11] saying tell the vision so there was a
[34:13] vision there to no man until until the
[34:15] son of man be risen again from the dead
[34:18] now we know he was killed physically
[34:20] 2,000 years ago but today uh the Lord
[34:23] just impressed on me to go back and read
[34:26] the the message of the indictment and
[34:29] I'm not indicting anybody today brother
[34:32] R's already indicted let the prophet do
[34:34] it but we're going to see how that
[34:36] though transition if we're transitioning
[34:38] to Perfection that had to happen and it
[34:40] had to happen exactly when it happened
[34:43] all right because God doesn't make a
[34:46] mistake and his disciples asked him
[34:49] saying why then say the scribes that
[34:51] Elias must first come and Jesus said
[34:54] unto them Eli truly shall first come and
[34:58] restore all things now remember John the
[35:01] Baptist did not restore all things so
[35:05] he's talking about another Elijah the
[35:08] next Elijah to come is to restore all
[35:11] things and they didn't understand that
[35:13] so he said okay we're talking about John
[35:15] the Baptist you just do they did to him
[35:18] what they listed they're going to do it
[35:19] to me but I'm going to die on a cross
[35:22] and then what they're going to do in the
[35:23] end time I got to send another Elijah
[35:25] because they're going to crucify me
[35:27] again all right so let's be seated the
[35:29] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[35:30] the
[35:31] word now
[35:33] remember Malachi 4 I was telling the the
[35:36] group in Honduras I told him I said you
[35:38] know the love of God I know God loved me
[35:40] because he did something for me brothers
[35:42] and sisters he sent me Elijah the
[35:44] prophet he didn't send him to
[35:47] you don't get quiet he didn't send him
[35:51] to you he send to me behold I will send
[35:53] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[35:55] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[35:56] Lord and he's going to do something he
[35:59] didn't just come here and preach and
[36:00] leave he did something we know John the
[36:03] Baptist turned the heart of the fathers
[36:05] which was the fathers in the Old
[36:07] Testament to the new Pentecostal babies
[36:10] when uh the day of Pentecost but from
[36:13] the day of Pentecost until now they have
[36:16] taken and put many denominational ideas
[36:18] they put many Creeds many dogmas and it
[36:21] just eroded the word down it didn't
[36:22] erode the word it was the effect of the
[36:24] word on the people and something had to
[36:27] happen to restore that back because
[36:29] Jesus said they're going to kill me the
[36:31] second time also all right this vision
[36:34] is not going to come until the son of
[36:35] man be risen
[36:37] again in the end time which is now cuz
[36:40] I'll read to you where brother Brown
[36:41] tells us that and why he indicted but
[36:44] now
[36:45] remember God has a perfect
[36:48] timing all right he's always perfect
[36:51] always on time never makes a
[36:54] mistake so and we'll look at it in the
[36:56] sequence of what brother brandham did
[36:58] and how he announced the indictment but
[37:00] we're going to read that one more time
[37:03] that he turned the heart of the children
[37:06] that I'm talking about the soul that's
[37:08] not your thumping gizzard heart as my
[37:10] dad always says it's your soul so he's
[37:12] going to turn our soul back he's going
[37:15] to literally put us in another place
[37:18] that has not been before he going to
[37:20] take the word of God and he's going to
[37:22] restore all things back through even the
[37:25] seals and everything he's going to open
[37:27] up and we're going to have an open book
[37:29] to to learn of the word of God see what
[37:32] God's done and as brother uh Joe was
[37:35] saying the actually the author is the
[37:37] one that's going to teach us how to read
[37:38] the book that he wrote all right that's
[37:41] why I believe with the Holy Ghost in the
[37:42] end time with the Holy Ghost that we
[37:44] have it's not a different Holy Ghost but
[37:46] it's more of
[37:48] it more of it that we're going to know
[37:52] more and have more of the mind of God
[37:55] than ever before because it's a
[37:56] requirement
[37:58] for us to get back to the son of man
[38:00] Ministry which was perfect that Ministry
[38:03] is and was perfect Jesus never made a
[38:06] mistake he never said oops he never said
[38:09] I didn't mean to say that everything he
[38:11] said the father agreed with because he
[38:13] and him were
[38:14] one and then the Holy Ghost is who some
[38:17] other
[38:18] person no the Holy Ghost is not another
[38:20] person it's the same person so he's not
[38:22] going to change his mind when he amorph
[38:25] into the group of people on the day of
[38:26] Pentecost he didn't change his mind his
[38:29] mind still set and Paul picked it up and
[38:31] said we must have that mind to continue
[38:33] on but what happened was in the Dark
[38:36] Ages and all the ages coming
[38:39] up I have to slow down I forget Lis is
[38:42] interpreting in there and listen let me
[38:44] tell you something brother Lise just
[38:46] give him a star while he's here those
[38:48] people in in the in Central America they
[38:50] love that guy they love that guy I mean
[38:54] they love him and U and he does good for
[38:57] him he's just not there he's not a he's
[38:59] not a glamour hog he likes to get in
[39:01] with a group of people and sit there and
[39:02] eat their food and and uh you know be
[39:05] with them and we sure do appreciate
[39:06] having brother Lis with us and uh he
[39:09] interpreted for me so I preach five
[39:11] sermons he preached six he preached One
[39:14] Singular and then five for me so um we
[39:17] sure do appreciate him back there
[39:18] interpreting now so sometimes I forget
[39:21] and take off but I'll slow down a little
[39:23] bit now when brother brandham comes on
[39:26] the scene we were talking about it weeks
[39:28] ago when brother R comes on the scene he
[39:31] had a message to bring but it had a
[39:32] two-fold
[39:34] meaning all right everybody with me had
[39:36] a two-fold meaning cuz he told us in the
[39:39] church age book he said this messenger
[39:41] of Malachi 4 will do two things number
[39:44] one just what I said turn the hearts of
[39:47] the children Babylon Pentecostal
[39:49] children babies back to the original
[39:52] Pentecost a growth development all right
[39:56] but then not stop there to continue on
[39:58] and open up the word where has never
[40:01] been seen before Jesus when he went off
[40:03] the scene he was the seals himself
[40:07] nobody understood him nobody knew who he
[40:09] was when he come back on the day of
[40:11] Pentecost he came back in a form of the
[40:12] Holy Ghost in the people but they didn't
[40:15] have everything they needed for a
[40:17] Rapture because you and I are the ones
[40:19] that's going to get that whole open book
[40:22] for the Rapture of the church everybody
[40:23] with me the opening of the seals the
[40:25] opening all the different different
[40:26] Mysteries of
[40:28] God and I was as I was telling that
[40:31] group over there and they they really
[40:32] rejoiced cuz every service I'd tell them
[40:35] that uh you know um our brother here's
[40:37] new and here in the church and we've
[40:40] been under a Teaching Ministry my dad
[40:41] for 50 years he's been the pastor of the
[40:44] church 40 something years and he passed
[40:46] on to be with the Lord but we had a
[40:48] wonderful Teaching Ministry and we know
[40:50] one thing for
[40:51] sure sometimes we don't understand
[40:54] everything but God said he would give it
[40:56] to us in the time that we needed it all
[40:59] right but you got to make yourself
[41:00] available you can't say I don't know
[41:02] what he's saying and just shut your ears
[41:04] off you got to keep your ears open and
[41:06] listen I told them uh the Hondurans over
[41:08] there I said look as I've told y'all
[41:10] before there's two things there's two
[41:13] Revelations that I got from this message
[41:15] that if I don't get another
[41:17] Revelation this will sustain me to the
[41:21] Rapture number one is I don't have to
[41:23] stand a tribulation
[41:25] period I will not be if I'm born again
[41:28] today I'll never in my life be in a
[41:30] tribulation period everybody else
[41:33] billions of people will go through the
[41:35] tribulation period without the Holy
[41:37] Ghost thank God he sent us a prophet to
[41:39] tell us we didn't have to do that
[41:42] because if you'll talk to baptist you
[41:43] talk to a Methodist you talk to
[41:45] Catholics every one of them's got to go
[41:46] through the tribulation yes right you
[41:49] talk to them and ask them oh yeah we got
[41:50] to we're just not worthy we can't do
[41:52] this well we God sent us a prophet to
[41:55] tell us we are worthy what's already
[41:58] been in the Bible that we're worthy
[42:00] we're white we have no wrinkles we have
[42:02] no
[42:03] spot so we don't have to go through the
[42:05] tribulation and the second thing is
[42:07] we'll never have to stand before the
[42:09] white Throne judgment ever we're going
[42:12] to be in judgment judging but we will
[42:15] never have to stand that horrible place
[42:18] to give an account of what you did yes I
[42:21] don't want to give an account of what I
[42:22] did no I don't want to be judged by my
[42:25] works the Bible says I want to be judged
[42:27] by his works and when I stand before the
[42:30] white Throne I'll be in judgment not
[42:33] judged not judged cuz the Saints will
[42:37] judge the Earth how are we going to
[42:38] judge the Earth cuz we're starting it
[42:40] right now right now we're judging now
[42:43] whether this message is right or wrong
[42:45] we're judging now whether this is right
[42:48] and whether this is wrong we're judging
[42:49] the World by walking into Walmart or
[42:52] different places walk through the
[42:53] country as I was telling the sisters
[42:55] over in Honduras you got to you got
[42:57] something you got a position that's
[42:59] greater even than the
[43:02] men I mean me and brother Donnie we put
[43:05] on regular clothes and we go down
[43:06] through the I mean we're not tatted up
[43:08] and don't have don't have uh earrings
[43:11] where they don't need to be and all kind
[43:13] of things a long hair but really we're
[43:15] just common guys brother Ryan you know
[43:18] you you you meet him on the road I'm a I
[43:20] deliver mail for the Post Office and
[43:23] Ryan drives a chicken truck and kills
[43:24] millions of chickens every day and
[43:26] doesn't care care a thing about it but
[43:28] anyway just money to you right but you
[43:31] see him driving down the road that's not
[43:33] a testimony now we know he is a
[43:34] testimony we know that but a sister just
[43:37] one of you sisters just walk through
[43:38] Walmart you walk into the grocery store
[43:40] you walk anywhere and you're a testimony
[43:43] cuz
[43:46] people now there's a lot of women that
[43:48] people go this and it ain't right but
[43:51] when you they it's a shock
[43:54] factor it's a shock Factor there's a a a
[43:57] a man in our community he's been to
[43:59] church here before and he met us in
[44:01] Walmart one time and I saw him walk by
[44:03] June was standing there and he walked by
[44:04] Roger corn tall guy he walked by and all
[44:07] I saw
[44:08] was he looked back down the aisle again
[44:11] well he came down there and he said God
[44:12] bless you Sister I appreciate you I love
[44:15] seeing somebody um dress Godly and he's
[44:18] a Pentecostal man so see you're there to
[44:21] be the witness for us but remember we're
[44:24] all feminist in the body so we have to
[44:27] contain
[44:28] ourself and be right also men we have to
[44:31] show and project the love of God because
[44:33] we are all feminist in the body of
[44:35] Christ but we are not going to have to
[44:37] go through the tribulation we're not
[44:39] going to have to stand judgment we have
[44:41] passed from Death un life and to me
[44:43] that's two great Revelations that if I
[44:45] don't get another one that's good enough
[44:46] for me that God's preserved me and
[44:49] protect me here I don't care heartaches
[44:51] trials tribulation whatever we go
[44:53] through we got to look at the promise am
[44:56] sir we got to look Abraham looked at the
[44:59] promise he didn't look at the
[45:00] circumstances if we look at the
[45:02] circumstances we're just going to get
[45:03] bogged down with this stinking world
[45:05] that we live
[45:07] in Praise the
[45:09] Lord but God did send us a way out he
[45:13] sent us now we know he sent the Holy
[45:15] Ghost not through brother
[45:18] brandham you should be able to receive
[45:21] the Holy Ghost without knowing who
[45:22] brother random was okay everybody with
[45:24] me he's not your Holy Ghost right he had
[45:28] the Holy Ghost and you got to get your
[45:30] own Holy Ghost and when you get the Holy
[45:32] Ghost as I've said many times before if
[45:34] you get the Holy Ghost you'll not leave
[45:36] this message it'll be so it'll be so
[45:39] much inside of you till it just becomes
[45:42] part of you and there's no way you can
[45:43] leave it CU God can't fight God no but
[45:46] now Satan can fight God and He does by
[45:49] false Doctrine and all the different
[45:51] things but if you have the baptism of
[45:52] the Holy Ghost in your soul you can't
[45:54] turn God down no you can't turn message
[45:57] down this is a believer's message you
[46:00] become an unbeliever when you can't
[46:01] believe what God sent us in the end time
[46:04] according to the word of God not
[46:06] according to somebody's thought or idea
[46:08] but according to the word of God I see
[46:10] more and more how God sent us something
[46:14] special yes
[46:15] absolutely yes
[46:19] sir but you got to take a hold of it
[46:21] though right you can't just say God sent
[46:24] us somebody and and we appreciate it no
[46:26] you got to live it we got to live the
[46:28] Bible First and when you live the Bible
[46:31] First and you get the true baptism of
[46:33] the Holy Ghost in your soul God will
[46:36] bring you up through that statue of
[46:37] perfect man if you'll ask him to do it
[46:40] you got to ask God remember brother Rand
[46:42] says God told us through him that the
[46:45] Holy Ghost is very timid now no one else
[46:47] has ever told us that but the prophet of
[46:49] God said the Holy Ghost is very timid
[46:51] he's not going to jump into your house
[46:53] and start knocking doors down no you're
[46:56] going to invite Men by the new birth but
[46:58] there still going to be doors that that
[47:00] you know like I've said many times
[47:02] before if I was a holy ghost thank God
[47:04] I'm not if I was the Holy Ghost I'd be
[47:06] brother Josie I'd be kicking him Doors
[47:08] Down seeing what's behind it but no
[47:10] God's timid he said if you'll let me in
[47:12] there I'll help you if you don't then I
[47:17] can't help you but thank God he sent us
[47:19] a prophet to tell us that too without a
[47:21] prophet we'd be lost we'd be absolutely
[47:24] lost bunch of people but thank God he
[47:27] did send him to me not
[47:29] you you got to believe that for yourself
[47:32] all right so now brother Ram comes to a
[47:35] time and he starts out and turn to Luke
[47:40] 23:33 and we're transitioning now
[47:44] brother Rand from 1947 to about 1962
[47:47] we're going to see here in a
[47:48] minute he he's having healing campaigns
[47:51] and he's he's bringing a little bit of
[47:52] the word and he's he's he's uh I don't
[47:55] say he's not compromising at all all but
[47:57] he's not blasting the denomination so
[48:00] much maybe in 59 and and so where he
[48:02] preached why against organized religion
[48:04] but remember when the seals broke he
[48:07] verbatim he said I know now why I hated
[48:10] that thing I know now why I hated that
[48:13] thing why I hated that denomination why
[48:16] he saw the Spirit behind it he saw that
[48:18] writer was that anaca spirit that was in
[48:21] the churches right all right and it
[48:23] could be in this one if we don't drive
[48:24] him out come on somebody
[48:27] listen the devil got here for you did
[48:30] he's sitting right beside
[48:32] you brother Jo you're good there's
[48:34] nobody s beside you but the devil I know
[48:38] okay so so God sent a prophet to do two
[48:42] things remember he's turning us back and
[48:45] then he's going to reveal the seals
[48:46] that's never been revealed before since
[48:48] Jesus left the face of the Earth the
[48:51] seals are going to be open and he says
[48:53] many many times and we'll get into it
[48:55] when we we're going to start in the
[48:56] major Doctrine here in
[48:58] January and and um help us to maybe
[49:01] understand what the third pull is some
[49:03] marriage and divorce and different
[49:04] things that he talked about that have
[49:07] been diluted by the Messengers of the of
[49:10] the U I say preachers in the church so
[49:14] we're going to try to bring it the way
[49:15] that that we see that that God sent us a
[49:18] prophet to give us this he sent him he
[49:21] sent that that man to me to give me this
[49:24] and whatever this is you got to hang on
[49:26] to it all right so he brought it to me
[49:29] so he brought it to me so maybe I can
[49:30] hand it out to you and you can uh you
[49:33] can uh uh use it for your benefit all
[49:36] right but remember in
[49:39] 1962 we see that he preached some of the
[49:42] great messages of spoken words Original
[49:44] Seed uh he preached on um what was it a
[49:49] restoration of the Bride tree and the
[49:50] different things if you're not fam
[49:53] familiar with it go back and look at
[49:54] your dates because dates do mean things
[49:56] all right I'm not much into all that but
[49:59] but God does have a timing you didn't
[50:01] get here until God saw you was going to
[50:04] get here right never before not after
[50:08] he's always on time so in December
[50:12] 1962 brother brandom announces now
[50:15] listen 1962
[50:17] December all right he announces that
[50:20] he's going to preach an
[50:25] indictment I want to bring the ministers
[50:27] together I didn't bring all the quotes
[50:28] but there's some of them in here we'll
[50:29] read if we have time but he says I'm
[50:33] going to bring this indictment I'm going
[50:34] to get all the ministers together this
[50:36] is not for the
[50:39] sinner see we ought to be sitting here
[50:41] today full of the Holy Ghost and not
[50:43] Sinners and then God can use you a
[50:46] different than he to get you saved is
[50:49] one thing but to get you up that statue
[50:52] of perfect man to get you where he can
[50:53] speak through you is a different story
[50:56] it's a different
[50:58] anointing amen it's not a different Holy
[51:01] Ghost it's a different anointing and
[51:03] brother R even tells us that the Holy
[51:05] Ghost will only work from what you bring
[51:07] him whatever you bring him if you bring
[51:09] him garbage he can't work right but if
[51:13] you bring him the word and you bring him
[51:15] an honest heart and you bring him
[51:16] something that's that's viable I God I'm
[51:19] sorry I I I'm at a place that I don't
[51:21] know where I'm I don't know where I'm
[51:23] good or bad right or wrong I don't know
[51:24] where I'm at my kids are going off here
[51:26] this was going on for there don't worry
[51:28] about
[51:29] that don't worry about that but say God
[51:32] you told me you promised me if I'd open
[51:34] my heart you'd give me something right
[51:38] and you made me a promise as Abraham
[51:40] stood Abram stood many years before he
[51:42] was turned to Abraham he stood many
[51:45] years with one promise you're going to
[51:48] bring a
[51:50] child and what happened was he's just
[51:53] Abram is just like us he tried to figure
[51:56] it out on his
[51:58] own he tried to help God and got a wild
[52:02] child from it give his wife away twice
[52:05] didn't go where he supposed to do God
[52:06] said get up and leave he didn't tell him
[52:08] and lot to get up and leave he told him
[52:10] to get up and leave but the first thing
[52:11] Abram did was he took his friend with
[52:13] him he took lot with him he brought
[52:15] somebody and lot was just the the burden
[52:17] in his
[52:19] bag same way with us we have things that
[52:21] we when God tells us to get up and walk
[52:23] what do we do we leave and want to bring
[52:25] all this stuff with with
[52:28] us that's kind of like
[52:31] justification justification he cleans
[52:34] you up but they still the demon is still
[52:36] there so your lot is still there what
[52:39] he's got to do is is he's got to get to
[52:41] one place to where Abram stood one day
[52:43] and said all right we got to
[52:47] separate which one do you
[52:50] want I'll take the other well in
[52:53] sanctification what happens the unclean
[52:55] Spirit I'm not calling lot an unclean
[52:57] spirit cuz the Bible said he had a
[52:58] righteous soul but I'm telling you that
[53:00] and the analogy is is Abram didn't get
[53:03] blessed until he let to lot left him so
[53:07] your lot whatever your lot is whatever
[53:09] your demon is whatever your your
[53:11] whatever you call whatever you want to
[53:13] it's the devil I told him over there in
[53:14] Honduras I said you got the same demons
[53:16] they just speak
[53:18] English so anyway and French not to
[53:22] leave the French out the French
[53:24] too but we do we have a same demons and
[53:27] they act pretty much the same way okay
[53:31] but he got rid of lot and God started
[53:33] what God started dealing war with Abram
[53:35] he started sanctification process he got
[53:38] the unclean Spirit out and he started
[53:39] same way with us in our journey we get
[53:41] rid of our lot and then we come up to
[53:43] still make
[53:45] mistakes still make mistakes Abram still
[53:48] made mistakes he made a mistake when he
[53:50] was
[53:51] Abraham come on when he got become
[53:54] Abraham that didn't make him God
[53:57] that made God closer to him but he still
[53:59] give his wife away in his new birth so
[54:03] we're still going to have problem now he
[54:05] didn't get to New Birth but the the
[54:06] analogy of of what's going on or the or
[54:09] the allegory that we're trying to prove
[54:11] there with Abram's Journey as he walked
[54:14] he got rid of stuff that's what you and
[54:15] I got to do we got to get rid of stuff
[54:17] Paul even tells us it's that weight that
[54:19] so easily besets us what does it do it
[54:21] hinders hinders our walk keeps us behind
[54:24] right and how do get rid of it
[54:28] is just get rid of
[54:32] it resist the devil and he'll flee from
[54:34] you that's the hardest verse in the
[54:37] whole Bible for us to really really
[54:40] believe is just resis him and he'll flee
[54:42] from you the problem is we entertain him
[54:45] and think that he might flee from us
[54:47] hello somebody amen well pray for me so
[54:52] in December
[54:53] 1962 brother R makes an announcement he
[54:56] said I'm going to get a group together
[54:58] and I'm going to of ministers and I'm
[55:00] going to not talk to Sinners I'm going
[55:01] to indict a generation that's why I read
[55:04] that scripture in Psalms that God would
[55:06] preserve a generation you and I are that
[55:09] last generation I was thinking yesterday
[55:11] when we come to 2025 I know a lot of
[55:14] y'all that's been in the message and us
[55:15] for a long time you'd have never thought
[55:17] 2025 would have ever been a calendar
[55:20] that we had to
[55:21] buy hello but it's here but we're one
[55:26] year closer to the coming of the Lord
[55:28] this thing is shortening down right
[55:31] whether you believe it or not this thing
[55:32] is getting closer and closer and now we
[55:34] see that the world is now lining up Sir
[55:38] the world's getting ready to boil over
[55:42] yes and we're sitting here sometimes on
[55:45] our hands can't get to church can't do
[55:48] this can't do that let every little
[55:49] weight easily beset us we can't do that
[55:52] we got to run this race Paul didn't say
[55:54] walk he said run this race but run it
[55:58] with
[55:58] patience you got to continue on this is
[56:01] not a this is not a microwave religion
[56:05] it's a crock poot religion in other
[56:07] words you turn it on low and you go and
[56:09] you keep going and you keep going and
[56:11] keep going come back you get ready to
[56:12] eat that's the way it's been for these
[56:14] every how many years you've been in the
[56:16] message but there will come a time there
[56:18] is going to come a time that we're going
[56:20] to see as Believers we're going to see
[56:22] the end
[56:23] time we're going to see the culmination
[56:26] of every one of these promises that
[56:28] God's give us you're not going to stop
[56:30] it like brother Brown said you can start
[56:32] tomorrow tonight and you can pray that
[56:34] the sun don't come up tomorrow and I'll
[56:36] promise you according to the word of God
[56:39] about 6:00 in the morning that Sun's
[56:40] going to break up break a horizon
[56:42] because God set it in motion you
[56:46] didn't so brother Ram comes to a time
[56:48] and and he reads this scripture here
[56:50] Luke
[56:51] 23:33 when they were come to the place
[56:54] which is called Calvary There They
[56:57] Crucified him and we know that he took
[57:00] the the the four words and we'll look at
[57:02] them in a minute but he took
[57:05] that and listen to how this listen to
[57:08] how that that God done in December of
[57:10] 1962 he makes that
[57:12] announcement all right in January of
[57:16] 1963 he makes another
[57:18] announcement I'm going to
[57:21] indict this generation I'm going to
[57:24] indict these ministers all right now
[57:26] that's January 1963 now the seals open
[57:29] in March of
[57:32] 1963 everybody with me March the 18th
[57:35] through the 24th is when the seals open
[57:38] at least open to the prophet and then
[57:40] now it's open to us if we'll believe
[57:43] it but now in
[57:46] 1963 he waits until
[57:49] July the 7th
[57:52] 77
[57:54] 1963 and he preaches the
[57:58] indictment he goes to Jeffersonville and
[58:00] he indicts the whole generation for the
[58:02] crucifix second crucifixion of Jesus
[58:05] Christ now how did he do that he did
[58:07] that because of the opening of the
[58:10] seals he didn't do it before he would
[58:12] have done it cuz he said in December I'm
[58:15] going to do it he said in January I'm
[58:16] going to do it he said it's on my heart
[58:18] to do this well he had to wait almost 7
[58:21] months before God give him the okay to
[58:24] to preach it because now the SE are open
[58:27] he sees where the Antichrist spirit is
[58:29] he knows as those denominations he knows
[58:32] that they're crucifying him again and
[58:34] then he can make that statement I can't
[58:37] do
[58:39] that I can't indict a
[58:41] generation a prophet can only do that CU
[58:44] remember he doesn't reveal anything
[58:46] until he reveals it to the prophet now
[58:48] when he reveals it to the prophet I can
[58:50] read it and we can understand that this
[58:52] transition that brother brandham was
[58:54] looking at he was looking at the people
[58:57] they're not getting it remember I read
[58:59] you sp in um uh what is it the SE um
[59:02] questions and answers on the seal he
[59:04] said you're not getting it it's not for
[59:06] you it's gone from
[59:09] you well now then he just wasted seven
[59:12] day eight days of preaching then if it
[59:14] was to nobody but it was to a group of
[59:16] people that comes to a mature place to
[59:19] where those seals can open and they
[59:20] weren't sitting there there there then
[59:22] they're sitting here
[59:24] now I say this day this scripture is
[59:27] fulfilled in your in your heart and in
[59:30] your ears you can hear this brother Bri
[59:33] said we'll have thus sayith the Lord or
[59:34] sit still well I say according to the
[59:36] word of God thus sayith the Lord we can
[59:39] understand the seals now thus sayith the
[59:41] Lord we can be a bride of Christ that'll
[59:43] take a rapture we can be a group of
[59:46] people that'll even take a body change
[59:48] that your body will absolutely be
[59:50] changed in the moon and twinkling of an
[59:52] eye I don't care how old it is I don't
[59:54] care how young it is
[59:57] all the old people they love that body
[1:00:00] change the young people as I said I told
[1:00:03] them over in hondur is the same thing I
[1:00:04] said when I preach the body change
[1:00:06] Brothers to to uh you're a little bit
[1:00:09] older but the some of the young people
[1:00:11] they go what do you mean body change I
[1:00:13] don't have no aches and pains and I jump
[1:00:15] up out of the bed and get my clothes on
[1:00:17] and I go to work and I work three jobs
[1:00:19] and come home and then go out and play
[1:00:21] and all blah blah blah and all us old
[1:00:24] people are are going even come quickly
[1:00:27] Lord Jesus cuz we have to get up in
[1:00:30] shifts we have to get up we tell your
[1:00:32] feet to get up tell your arms to get up
[1:00:34] and hope that they get up on the same
[1:00:38] level that's why brother Donnie every
[1:00:40] time we do that he says amen being in
[1:00:42] your 70s it does make a difference cuz
[1:00:44] I'll be 65 in a few weeks and it's uh
[1:00:47] it's pretty tough don't laugh brother
[1:00:51] Jo but it is I mean but we got to all
[1:00:54] though come to a place to where we we're
[1:00:56] tired of living here we're tired of
[1:00:58] going to the doctor we're tired of
[1:01:00] taking pills to stay
[1:01:03] alive that's right am I not with
[1:01:05] somebody today is somebody not we're
[1:01:07] just tired of this place we love we love
[1:01:11] our kids and grandkids and and and some
[1:01:13] of you uh weird people love your job so
[1:01:17] um other than
[1:01:19] that it's just getting worse and
[1:01:22] worse listen it's like brother bobber or
[1:01:25] brother Aon and said I don't care who
[1:01:27] you put in the White House it ain't
[1:01:28] going to get no better nothing's going
[1:01:30] to get better as far as the world is but
[1:01:32] praise God the bride's going to get
[1:01:34] better the bride's not going to fall
[1:01:36] apart the true bride is going to
[1:01:38] absolutely stand at the end time and say
[1:01:41] come on Bring it on Bring it
[1:01:46] on and God's obligated to bring it to us
[1:01:49] cuz somebody is going to fulfill the
[1:01:53] scripture somebody is I'm just dumb
[1:01:55] enough to believe it's me and you too
[1:01:59] amen so brother rown tells us in 1963
[1:02:04] preaches this message the indictment and
[1:02:07] we'll talk about that for just a few
[1:02:10] minutes the word
[1:02:12] indictment is a formal charge or
[1:02:15] accusation of a serious
[1:02:17] crime all right an indictment for
[1:02:21] conspiracy um or it's I like this a
[1:02:24] thing that serves to illustrate that a
[1:02:28] system brother Brandon was looking at a
[1:02:31] system it wasn't looking at an
[1:02:33] individuals no he was looking at a
[1:02:36] system all right a thing that serves to
[1:02:38] illustrate that a system or situation is
[1:02:42] bad and deserve to be
[1:02:46] indicted the example of these rapidly
[1:02:48] escalating crime figures are an
[1:02:50] indictment of our society so brother
[1:02:52] brandom I think he just got to a place
[1:02:55] to where
[1:02:56] he took all he's going to take right he
[1:02:59] and he listen brother I'm never
[1:03:02] compromised but he did watch what he was
[1:03:04] doing cuz you watch him when he's
[1:03:06] preaching several sermons in different
[1:03:08] places he's careful but once you get up
[1:03:11] to about 19 right here he ain't careful
[1:03:13] no more that's right he's bringing it
[1:03:16] and I you know if you if you watch that
[1:03:17] movie The or the series The Chosen Jesus
[1:03:20] has been all nice and kind for about
[1:03:22] three seasons or two and a half seasons
[1:03:24] and all of a sudden he looked at him and
[1:03:26] what'd he say he said his fixing to get
[1:03:29] rough cuz he' had enough and then you
[1:03:31] finally see him confronting the the the
[1:03:34] religion of the day he was confronting
[1:03:36] them all the time he kind of avoided
[1:03:38] them at a little while but when you come
[1:03:40] to the place to where the son of man
[1:03:42] just gets tired sick and tired of being
[1:03:45] sick and tired he's going to bring his
[1:03:47] message now remember when Jesus brought
[1:03:49] his
[1:03:50] message that's when people hated him as
[1:03:53] I was telling him over in in Honduras
[1:03:56] the world Listen Sinners don't Sinners
[1:03:58] is not going to they're not your
[1:04:03] persecution Sinners don't bother me I
[1:04:06] know who they are they know who they are
[1:04:08] and they act the way Sinners act but
[1:04:11] it's when a religious person come on
[1:04:13] somebody it's when a religious person
[1:04:15] bring something to you that's totally
[1:04:17] false well who killed Jesus the Sinners
[1:04:21] didn't hate
[1:04:22] him even some of the publicans didn't
[1:04:24] hate him
[1:04:26] they believed in who hated him the
[1:04:29] religious group of the day hated the son
[1:04:33] of man now if we believe the son of man
[1:04:36] Ministry is in a group of people
[1:04:39] today that same Ministry is going to
[1:04:42] have the same characteristics and it's
[1:04:45] going to cause the same
[1:04:48] reaction your worst enemy is going to be
[1:04:51] supposedly your
[1:04:53] brother everybody with me right amen if
[1:04:56] it was then it's got to be
[1:04:58] now everything if you want to know what
[1:05:00] the son of man Ministry is read Matthew
[1:05:02] Bart Luke and
[1:05:05] John you read Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:05:08] there's your son of man Ministry and
[1:05:09] that's what you and I are under now the
[1:05:11] son of man Ministry because what
[1:05:14] happened was is when he indicted this
[1:05:17] generation in in in July the 7th of
[1:05:22] 1963 and then on same month in j July
[1:05:26] the 28th he preaches Christ The Mystery
[1:05:29] of God revealed one of the greatest
[1:05:31] sermons he ever preached in his life and
[1:05:33] he brought the bride together and put
[1:05:36] the world
[1:05:37] out come on somebody he brought the

[1:08:52] pull pit in the church is a courtroom
[1:08:54] the Bible said it's a judgment seat it
[1:08:56] must begin at the house of the Lord and
[1:08:58] this is like the throne and the jury and
[1:09:00] the witnesses and so forth I have today
[1:09:02] for my witness God's word and my
[1:09:05] indictment is against the churches of
[1:09:08] today now I'm not bringing the sinner
[1:09:11] into

[1:09:19] bringing religious
[1:09:20] people I'm not bringing the Sinners into
[1:09:23] this I'm just speaking this to the
[1:09:25] church church and it being the tapes and
[1:09:27] I try to get through as quick as I can I
[1:09:29] indict this generation for the second
[1:09:32] crucifixion of Jesus Christ and now to
[1:09:35] do this in this age that we live in I do
[1:09:38] this I must show an Evidence if I have
[1:09:41] to bring an
[1:09:42] indictment you have to show an Evidence
[1:09:44] of the criminal offense that's been done
[1:09:46] I have to indict them I have to bring
[1:09:48] the evidence to prove it and it is that
[1:09:51] what I'm saying will stand up before the
[1:09:53] main judge
[1:09:55] look how confident he is cu the seals
[1:09:58] are open I mean the whole word's there
[1:10:00] there is no there's nothing compromised
[1:10:03] there's nothing that he's worried
[1:10:08] about what I'm saying will stand up
[1:10:11] before the main judge which I take
[1:10:13] myself as an attorney to this indictment
[1:10:15] that the word of God being my witness I
[1:10:17] indict this generation for the
[1:10:20] crucifixion now watch I must show and
[1:10:23] will show that The Same Spirit is on the
[1:10:25] people today that brought the first
[1:10:30] crucifixion wow and doing the same thing
[1:10:34] I must do that it's going to be a
[1:10:35] crucifixion that they've crucified I
[1:10:38] must show to the people that the same
[1:10:40] attitude in the people
[1:10:43] today now how' you like to be a
[1:10:45] denominational Minister sitting in that
[1:10:46] congregation right then and he's talking
[1:10:49] to you he ain't talking to somebody else
[1:10:51] he's talking to
[1:10:53] you I'm going to show the people that
[1:10:55] same attitude in the people today is
[1:10:57] doing the same thing spiritually they
[1:11:00] did physically
[1:11:02] then now
[1:11:04] watch it could not have been done a few
[1:11:06] years
[1:11:08] ago look how precise God
[1:11:11] is because we're transitioning to
[1:11:14] Perfection we had to come through
[1:11:15] something that was partial to get to
[1:11:19] Perfection all right so the Perfection
[1:11:22] was the book's open now and you can call
[1:11:24] what is is all right it could not have
[1:11:26] been done a few years ago I say 50 years
[1:11:29] ago it could not have been done but
[1:11:31] today this is very timely and it could
[1:11:33] not have been done maybe 10 years ago
[1:11:35] but it can be done today because time is
[1:11:38] running out or run out and we're at the
[1:11:41] end
[1:11:44] time they are the greatest religious
[1:11:46] City they the most religious people
[1:11:50] crucified the most shameful death him
[1:11:53] the most precious person if that ain't
[1:11:55] enough to condemn this
[1:11:57] generation listen he wasn't condemning
[1:12:00] Sinners he wasn't condemning prostitutes
[1:12:03] he was condemning religious
[1:12:06] people everybody with me I hope I make a
[1:12:09] point here that's why this transition to
[1:12:11] Perfection has got to be so real that we
[1:12:14] transition out of that well that's okay
[1:12:16] if you do this and well it might be okay
[1:12:18] if you do that it might be as well I
[1:12:20] think he meant this and well I think he
[1:12:22] meant that
[1:12:23] no no brother knew what God said he knew
[1:12:27] what God meant he had the love letter in
[1:12:29] his hand he got the Revelation he got
[1:12:32] the vision that Jesus said tell that
[1:12:33] Vision to no one until the son of man be
[1:12:36] risen again so that vision is now open
[1:12:39] to me and you that we can look at it and
[1:12:41] see what he's preached and how to live
[1:12:44] and how to understand what God's done
[1:12:46] and how to understand what God Said
[1:12:48] already not something new we don't bring
[1:12:50] nothing
[1:12:52] new they are the most religious
[1:12:54] organization
[1:12:56] the biggest of all the churches gathered
[1:12:58] together in one place they the most
[1:13:00] religious people of all the races the
[1:13:03] people who are supposed to be the very
[1:13:05] worshippers of God they gathered at the
[1:13:08] greatest holy Feast they got the
[1:13:11] cleansing of the Passover when they were
[1:13:13] brought from bondage into Liberty and
[1:13:15] there in that time they at that time the
[1:13:18] most religious people in the most
[1:13:21] religious feast at the most religious
[1:13:24] place right brought upon the Prince of
[1:13:27] Life the most shameful thing that could
[1:13:29] have been done strip a man and hang him
[1:13:31] on a tree cuz cursed the law said that
[1:13:34] they worship by cursed is he that hangs
[1:13:36] on the tree and he was made a curse for
[1:13:38] us stripped his clothes beat him and
[1:13:41] mocked him the very God Of
[1:13:43] Heaven capital punishment brother Brown
[1:13:47] says now
[1:13:49] listen he's talking to everybody now
[1:13:51] watch where you meet is under the shed
[1:13:54] blood you and I same way
[1:13:57] today not a thought not an idea not a
[1:14:00] concept but the very blood of Jesus
[1:14:03] Christ and even brother Ram tells us in
[1:14:05] this transformation when he's preaching
[1:14:07] to us he's telling us that we are now
[1:14:09] the blood by the spirit the bride is the
[1:14:11] blood by the spirit amen you are the
[1:14:14] literal blood listen that's why I just
[1:14:17] caught that that's why you don't have to
[1:14:19] stand judgment cuz you're the blood you
[1:14:23] don't have to stand in Tribulation cuz
[1:14:24] you're the blood
[1:14:25] BL if we're the blood by the spirit then
[1:14:28] we're the only thing that's keeping this
[1:14:29] world together the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:32] is all over
[1:14:35] us keeping us it's actually keeping the
[1:14:37] world from falling apart that's right
[1:14:39] but there's going to come a time though
[1:14:41] when they're going to have enough of us
[1:14:42] just like they did Jesus and they're
[1:14:44] going to do the same thing they may not
[1:14:46] kill us physically they may
[1:14:49] absolutely try their best to break us up
[1:14:51] move us and try to get us to do things
[1:14:53] wrong
[1:14:55] but the bride's got to hold on you and I
[1:14:58] if we're the
[1:14:59] bride it's like somebody said long time
[1:15:03] ago um that the bride's not looking real
[1:15:07] good well that's not what the Bible say
[1:15:09] right you're looking at the mixed
[1:15:11] multitude you're looking at the you're
[1:15:14] looking at the false prophets you're
[1:15:16] looking at the uh foolish virgin right
[1:15:19] the brides always look good listen Jesus
[1:15:22] wouldn't have married us if we weren't a
[1:15:23] pretty bride right
[1:15:26] he knows who we are he knows our
[1:15:28] potential we just got to open up and use
[1:15:31] that potential bring that potential to
[1:15:34] the Forefront so that this year coming
[1:15:37] up that our maybe our resolution is is
[1:15:40] to be
[1:15:41] better Christians closer to God than
[1:15:44] ever before read the word of God more
[1:15:46] than we ever read it before pray more
[1:15:49] than we've ever read it ever prayed
[1:15:51] before Fellowship more than we ever
[1:15:53] fellowship before God is a uh God is a
[1:15:56] bring he brings people together Satan
[1:15:58] divides Satan always
[1:16:01] divides he'll get you he'll get the weak
[1:16:03] one separated over to the side and eat
[1:16:06] you
[1:16:12] up but praise
[1:16:15] God We've Got a Good Shepherd I ain't
[1:16:17] talking about me I'm talking about we
[1:16:19] got a real Shepherd that's with you when
[1:16:21] I'm not that'll bring you back in the
[1:16:23] fold if you'll just let him amen
[1:16:25] but now remember that Shepherd hook goes
[1:16:27] out there pretty quick and drags you in
[1:16:28] it's not just something where they pat
[1:16:30] you on the B say come on over here
[1:16:31] remember he had to break the analogy of
[1:16:33] one he had to break one of his leg he
[1:16:35] kept running off and and he had to break
[1:16:38] his leg to keep it back in the fold
[1:16:40] sometimes God has to put things on us to
[1:16:41] keep us in the fall because we're human
[1:16:44] beings and we're going to be human
[1:16:46] beings until this thing's over with now
[1:16:48] he'll not meet just because you're
[1:16:50] Pentecostal he went through the
[1:16:51] Methodist he'll meet you under one
[1:16:53] condition that's under the shed blood
[1:16:55] when your sins has been confessed and
[1:16:57] expelled in his presence then by the
[1:16:59] blood and the blood is always before him
[1:17:02] and therefore he only can see you
[1:17:03] through that shed blood and you're white
[1:17:06] as snow see when you've confessed your
[1:17:09] sins otherwise you're not there you
[1:17:11] cannot
[1:17:12] Fellowship that's the reason that you
[1:17:14] don't see things happening in the
[1:17:16] churches they confess that they believe
[1:17:19] the blood but they reject the very plan
[1:17:22] to get to the blood which is the word
[1:17:25] all right there's only one way God will
[1:17:27] honor that word you'll never honor that
[1:17:30] word come and say I'm a Roman Catholic I
[1:17:32] the man this to be done you can't do it
[1:17:34] Methodist Baptist you can't do it the
[1:17:36] only way you can do it is under the
[1:17:38] mercies of God through his grace is to
[1:17:41] come through the shed blood of Jesus
[1:17:42] Christ say Lord I claim the promise and
[1:17:46] then if you really are under that blood
[1:17:48] watch God is obligated to his
[1:17:50] word so he's obligated to you he's
[1:17:53] obligated to his word not anything else
[1:17:55] but if you put yourself in there he's
[1:17:57] obligated to help you but first you got
[1:18:00] to be under the
[1:18:01] blood all right we don't have to be
[1:18:04] handshaking like the
[1:18:06] Baptist join a fellowship like the
[1:18:08] Methodist speak in tongues like the
[1:18:10] Pentecostal and whatever you want to say
[1:18:12] all the other ones is we know that's
[1:18:14] what brother ROM was saying he said it's
[1:18:15] the shed blood of Jesus Christ and when
[1:18:17] you come under that it doesn't divide it
[1:18:19] brings everything together now sure it
[1:18:22] divides the sin but it brings us
[1:18:23] together in Fellowship with each
[1:18:27] other brotherly kindness is uh hard to
[1:18:31] do sometimes but God told us we needed
[1:18:34] to do that that's right need to have
[1:18:35] brotherly kindness I preached one sermon
[1:18:38] um that Thursday night at the tent and
[1:18:42] uh there's a lot of ministers there and
[1:18:45] probably a lot of different ideas but I
[1:18:48] preached on a new
[1:18:50] commandment Jesus said a new commandment
[1:18:53] I give you that's right not an old one a
[1:18:55] new one he says love everybody amen love
[1:19:00] your
[1:19:00] neighbor as you love
[1:19:03] yourself do good to those that
[1:19:06] despitefully use
[1:19:08] you that don't even feel good does
[1:19:12] it but that's what Jesus said if you're
[1:19:14] going to be his disciple you got to pray
[1:19:17] for those that despitefully use
[1:19:20] you that's right all it gets quiet but
[1:19:23] that's okay have you ever tried that
[1:19:26] though the Bible said if you do it
[1:19:28] you'll Heap coals on the person that
[1:19:29] you're praying
[1:19:30] for you can't do anything about them you
[1:19:33] can do something about you you can't do
[1:19:35] anything about them but start loving
[1:19:38] everybody let's all get to loving
[1:19:40] everybody and love them with Godly love
[1:19:42] not this garbage love like the world's
[1:19:44] got oh I just love you I love to hunt I
[1:19:47] love to fish I love love is just that
[1:19:49] word is
[1:19:50] just horribly used
[1:19:53] word right
[1:19:55] even you can't love your wife as much as
[1:19:57] you love her you can't love her with
[1:19:59] agape love if you don't have the new
[1:20:02] birth and she don't have the new birth
[1:20:05] it's all fil your love it's all love
[1:20:07] down here on the earth unless you got
[1:20:09] the agapy love of God you can't love
[1:20:12] people that's why the Born Again people
[1:20:15] will and will always love one another
[1:20:19] it's the mixed multitude that you have
[1:20:20] to worry
[1:20:22] about all right now listen just for a
[1:20:25] second then we'll be done from then on
[1:20:27] comes the word and the word only from
[1:20:29] the old Pascal lamb passed away and
[1:20:31] Christ became our lamb at the day of the
[1:20:33] crucifixion at the day that the
[1:20:35] denomination crucified the word of God
[1:20:38] and accepted a Creed instead of the word
[1:20:41] that's the day the word came into full
[1:20:43] effect now
[1:20:44] look you would think he would say no
[1:20:47] that deluded the word that made it
[1:20:48] softer no he said the only time the real
[1:20:51] word can come into full effect is when
[1:20:53] they do that
[1:20:56] when God gives it we go through
[1:20:59] persecution and we're a child of God
[1:21:02] it's for our
[1:21:04] good and I know you hate that but but
[1:21:07] that's the way it is we're just human
[1:21:09] beings but if they accept the Creed
[1:21:11] instead of the word that's the day the
[1:21:13] word come into full effect that's just
[1:21:16] been
[1:21:19] recently all right everybody with me he
[1:21:21] he's referring to the seals that just
[1:21:24] was
[1:21:25] recently and today I indict this bunch
[1:21:28] of ordained ministers in their Creeds
[1:21:30] and
[1:21:31] denominations they are crucifying to the
[1:21:34] people the very God that they claim they
[1:21:37] love and serve I indict these ministers
[1:21:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus upon their
[1:21:42] doctrine that claim that the days and
[1:21:44] miracles is passed that water baptism in
[1:21:47] the name of Jesus Christ is not
[1:21:48] sufficient and not right upon any of
[1:21:51] these words that they have substituted
[1:21:52] Creeds for I indict
[1:21:56] them as guilty
[1:21:59] right he's already been judge jury
[1:22:02] execution he indicted them and then
[1:22:06] he put them where they supposed to be
[1:22:09] now
[1:22:12] watch blood of Jesus Christ is on their
[1:22:14] hands for crucifying a fresh the Lord
[1:22:16] Jesus the second time they are
[1:22:18] crucifying Christ to the public taking
[1:22:21] from them the thing that they're
[1:22:22] supposed to be giving to them and they
[1:22:25] substitute something else in its place a
[1:22:27] church Creed for popularity the church
[1:22:31] hated him why he was the very God they
[1:22:34] hated him and denied him to be their
[1:22:36] Messiah no sir they didn't want such a
[1:22:38] messiah as that now listen and today the
[1:22:41] church does the same thing it denies the
[1:22:44] word they don't want it it's
[1:22:46] contradictory to what they've been
[1:22:47] taught to believe by their Creeds and
[1:22:50] the word is the Messiah do you believe
[1:22:54] that yeah congregation says amen well
[1:22:56] the reflection of the word is what a
[1:23:00] reflecting of Messiah that's why brother
[1:23:02] Brown called us little Messiah and I
[1:23:03] love that he he gave me the title little
[1:23:06] legal little Messiah he gave me that
[1:23:08] title I got to learn how to live it
[1:23:10] right amen which is the Holy Ghost Among
[1:23:13] Us he is reflecting himself tries to
[1:23:16] wherever he can find a lamp that he can
[1:23:18] look through that ain't smoked up with
[1:23:20] Creeds and things he gives the light
[1:23:23] through so he's come to a place to where
[1:23:25] he said look this is that my my Ministry
[1:23:28] is
[1:23:29] transitioning from from like I said he
[1:23:32] never compromise but he would always
[1:23:34] greet him and say this and say that but
[1:23:37] he come to a place where that seals
[1:23:38] those seals opened up he said there's
[1:23:41] right and wrong right there's white
[1:23:43] horse black horse red horse gray horse
[1:23:48] and that's all satan right and then
[1:23:51] here's the bride over here there's a
[1:23:53] separation time
[1:23:55] and that's when he could preach all the
[1:23:56] other messages I want to read you this
[1:23:59] then we'll
[1:24:00] close cut some up short won't be too
[1:24:03] long today we got visitors

[1:24:08] watch this is another witness but this
[1:24:10] is in 1958 I want to show this witness
[1:24:13] and this is really struck home to me
[1:24:15] reading it the way brother brandham put
[1:24:17] it out tonight when they just called in
[1:24:20] bbub he said I'll forgive you for that
[1:24:22] but when the Holy Ghost has come and
[1:24:24] does it there'll never be forgiveness
[1:24:27] for that all right so I say to Jesus
[1:24:31] after his death bu and Resurrection his
[1:24:32] power is stronger and more persuading
[1:24:35] tonight than it was back there in that
[1:24:37] day so what will she do he talking about
[1:24:39] the Queen of Sheba so what would she do
[1:24:42] to this generation we're talking about a
[1:24:43] generation for this is God's last call
[1:24:47] sending the Holy Ghost into the church
[1:24:49] to call his people it's God's last call
[1:24:52] she wasn't scared she didn't care what
[1:24:54] the presor was going to say when she got
[1:24:56] back what the bishop and all them was
[1:24:58] going to say she stood publicly and she
[1:25:01] said all that I heard is the truth and
[1:25:03] more than I heard is the truth can we
[1:25:06] say that ourself if we heard the truth
[1:25:09] and more more of the truth than anyone
[1:25:12] else is in on the face of the earth is
[1:25:14] come to me and
[1:25:15] you man you ought to take that we hold
[1:25:18] dear all kind of stuff we hold de stuff
[1:25:22] from the past and stuff relics we don't
[1:25:24] want the kids to break that because
[1:25:26] grandma gave it to us what about the
[1:25:28] word of God you do the same thing with
[1:25:32] it well I'm going to preach
[1:25:34] anyway cuz we all got to do that we all
[1:25:37] got to quit looking at relics
[1:25:39] right and look at the truth the word of
[1:25:42] God now watch what he says then we'll
[1:25:43] close she stood publicly she said all
[1:25:45] that I heard is the truth and more than
[1:25:46] I heard is the truth she stood for God
[1:25:49] and she supported the things and she
[1:25:52] stands today Immortal with the words of
[1:25:56] Jesus Christ that says when she Rises on
[1:25:59] the scene in the resurrection her
[1:26:01] obedience to God will
[1:26:04] condemn that
[1:26:06] generation wow for she stood for what
[1:26:10] was right you know what brother R's
[1:26:11] talking about the underlying meaning of
[1:26:14] this whole thing is the denominations
[1:26:15] are getting ready to cut him off they
[1:26:17] don't like him anymore they don't like

[1:26:20] bringing Doctrine this is 1958 coming up
[1:26:22] 5960
[1:26:24] for she stood for what was right when
[1:26:26] God sent his gift to the Earth and it
[1:26:29] was being manifested she came from the
[1:26:31] utmost parts of the earth to hear the
[1:26:33] wisdom of Solomon 1958 have faith in God
[1:26:37] what will she do when she comes to the

[1:27:53] gift show but if you got something in
[1:27:56] you that's wrong let it out too get rid
[1:27:58] of it let's stand to our
[1:28:05] feet the queen of the South she was
[1:28:07] extremely
[1:28:09] rich she was powerful but the prophet of
[1:28:12] God said she traveled hundreds of
[1:28:15] miles there's one quote I didn't ring
[1:28:17] didn't bring where where brother BR
[1:28:19] illustrates it as her sitting in his
[1:28:22] congregation and watching the signs and
[1:28:25] wonders and watching
[1:28:28] Solomon with the gift and the gift of
[1:28:31] discernment course he was talking about
[1:28:33] himself but he was using that as
[1:28:36] illustration and that said she sat there
[1:28:38] and wondered and said she didn't get up
[1:28:40] and leave and call her State president
[1:28:41] her and tell them what was going on she
[1:28:43] sat there and at the end of it you know
[1:28:45] what she did she supported it she took
[1:28:49] all the gold all the silver all the
[1:28:50] every how many 30 camels or every how
[1:28:52] many loads of of um Treasures she had
[1:28:55] and she laid them at the feet of Solomon
[1:28:57] because of the gift that he had she
[1:28:59] supported
[1:29:00] it let's support the gift of God you
[1:29:03] don't have to do it monetarily I'd
[1:29:04] rather do it prayer do it prayerfully
[1:29:07] praying praying that the word of God
[1:29:09] will be more strong this year than never
[1:29:11] before our kids are growing up they're
[1:29:13] getting to be
[1:29:17] adults they going to step out in this
[1:29:19] world without God I hope
[1:29:21] not so we're going to pray for them more
[1:29:24] and more and more God bless you just
[1:29:29] take these words and listen there was
[1:29:31] there was a whole generation was
[1:29:32] indicted by a prophet and that
[1:29:34] indictment didn't go away it's still
[1:29:37] happening right
[1:29:38] now every time the word Goes Forth and
[1:29:41] somebody turns it down they're being
[1:29:43] indicted by the word of God not by
[1:29:46] William brandham by the word of God
[1:29:49] through a prophet which said I indict
[1:29:51] this whole generation for the second cre
[1:29:54] crucifixion to Jesus Christ let's don't
[1:29:55] crucify him again let's open our heart

[1:33:54] you've heard me tell this story before
[1:33:57] but I sitting in the getting ready to go
[1:34:00] on a trip somewhere and uh Atlanta
[1:34:03] Atlanta Airport's just full of people
[1:34:05] they just all kind of people it's a
[1:34:06] Melting Pot and you sat there and as um
[1:34:10] Sister Christine and brother Lise and I
[1:34:12] were sitting there you know you you can
[1:34:13] close your you can close your eyes and
[1:34:15] you can tell who's
[1:34:16] late cuz you hear the thing coming down
[1:34:20] there cuz they're late they pulling
[1:34:22] their luggage you know trying to get
[1:34:23] there and then you got the ones L that's
[1:34:25] like us to get there an hour or so
[1:34:26] before and we just leisurely sit around
[1:34:29] and talk and and but I sitting there one
[1:34:32] day and Lord in Atlanta if you sit there
[1:34:35] long enough you can see 3 or 4 thousand
[1:34:37] people in just in one row you know
[1:34:39] walking through the
[1:34:41] airport and I said God
[1:34:45] why did you choose
[1:34:48] me and not these
[1:34:51] people why why did you choose me why did
[1:34:54] you let me hear this why did you let me
[1:34:56] come to
[1:34:58] this he spoke to me just as plain as day
[1:35:00] not an audable voice but inside of me he
[1:35:02] said you accepted me and they
[1:35:05] won't that's the
[1:35:08] difference you accepted me and they
[1:35:11] won't you know I wondered many many
[1:35:13] times how that uh God could cut
[1:35:16] somebody's life shter or let somebody
[1:35:18] live like Adolf Hitler and different
[1:35:19] things and do all that and we know it's
[1:35:21] the grace of God but you know if God
[1:35:24] knows everything he knew that he give if
[1:35:26] he give Adolf Hitler a million years to
[1:35:27] repent he'd never repent he'd never come
[1:35:29] to that place so he let him do what he
[1:35:32] did for a purpose and took him off the
[1:35:34] scene same way with um even young people
[1:35:37] and and like uh friends and stuff that
[1:35:40] that God takes off the scene and well
[1:35:42] you know one thing's for sure if they're
[1:35:44] not bride they're not going to have to
[1:35:46] go through the tribulation either so
[1:35:48] they going to come up to the white
[1:35:49] Throne judgment and maybe they have to
[1:35:50] give an account and then we can say
[1:35:54] that brother was good to me that sister
[1:35:56] gave me a glass of water that brother
[1:35:58] changed my tire or that man changed my
[1:36:00] tire and God's going to look and say all
[1:36:03] right because of that person you're
[1:36:06] going to get eternal
[1:36:08] life that's what eternal life is it's
[1:36:11] living for others not living for
[1:36:14] yourself living for others you love the
