Description:
THERE WAS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN YOU!  NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD HAVE                     REDEEMED YOU!  IT IS GRACE!  "God’s unmerited favor."

"To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein HE HATH MADE US ACCEPTED in the beloved."

THE GREEK WORD TRANSLATED HERE "accepted" IS USED ONLY 1 OTHER TIME IN THE SCRIPTURES:

LUKE 1:28
»     28     †    "And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured (OR ACCEPTED), the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."

OH, WHAT A BLESSED THOUGHT!  OUR ACCEPTANCE IS NOT FUTURE TENSE - OUR ACCEPTANCE IS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT!

JEREMIAH 31:3
»     3        "The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee."

JOHN 15:9
»     9     †      ¶  As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.

CONSIDER SOMETHING:   
HEBREWS 7:7-10    
»     7     †     And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 
»     8     †     And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. 
»     9     †     And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. 
»     10     †     For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.

DID LEVI ACTUALLY PAY TITHES?  NO, SIR!  YET, IT WAS ACCOUNTED TO HIM BECAUSE HE WAS IN                                    THE LOINS of ABRAHAM!

WE NEVER PAID THE DEBT of SIN, YET IT’S CREDITED TO OUR ACCOUNT, BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE             LOINS of OUR FATHER, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHEN HE PAID THE DEBT!
Debt has been cancelled!   Paid in full!  No balance!

DOESN’T THAT GIVE DYING GRACE?  NOT WONDERING, "Will He accept me when I stand before                                         Him?"  NO, NO!  HE HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED YOU!

"I may be poor, but I’m accepted in the beloved!"
"I may be uneducated   """"""""""""""""""""""""
"I may be crippled,...

holy holy holy holy holy want to see [Music] do you really want to see in this evening a man god bless you have your seat for just a moment like to share something with you just before we go to the word this evening and the all musicians I'm not a singer so I won't try to do that tonight I came across this little note little thought from Spurgeon and I hope that's okay he says that a book is the expression of the thoughts of the writer the book of nature is an expression of the thoughts of God he said we have God's terrible thoughts in the thunder and lightning God's loving thoughts in the sunshine and the balmy breeze God's bounteous bounteous prudent careful thoughts in the waving harvest in the ripening meadow said we have God's brilliant thoughts in the wondrous scenes which are beheld from the mountain top and the valley and we have God's most sweet and present thoughts of beauty in the little flowers that blossom at our feet but you will remark that God has in nature given most prominence to those thoughts that needed to have preeminence he has not given us broad acres over spread with flowers for they were not needed in such abundance but he has spread forth the fields with corn that thus the absolute necessities of life might be supplied he said we needed most of the thoughts of his Providence and he hath quickened our industry so that God's providential care may be read as we ride along the roadside on every side now God's book of grace is just like his book of nature it is his thoughts written out this great book the Bible this most precious volume is the heart of God made legible it is the gold of God's love beaten out into leaf gold so that there with our thoughts might be played in and we also might have golden good and holy thoughts concerning him and you will mark that as in nature so in grace the most necessary is the most prominent I see in God's Word a rich abundance of flowers of glorious eloquence often I find a prophet marshalling his words like armies for might and like kings for majesty but far more frequently I read simple declarations of truths I see here there here and there a brilliant thought of beauty but I find whole fields of plain didactic doctrine that's doctrine that will help you and instruct you amen he said which is food for the Soul and I find whole chapters full of Christ which is divine manna whereon the soul doth feed I see starry words to make the Scriptures brilliant sweet thoughts to make them fare great thoughts to make them impressive terrible thoughts to make them awful but necessary thoughts instructive thoughts saving thoughts are far more frequent because far more necessary here and there a bed of flowers but broad acres of living corn of the gospel of the grace of God you must excuse me then he said if I very frequently dwell on the whole topic of salvation he said last Sabbath I brought you one shock of the wit this week in the fashion of Christ's promise which says he that calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved and then I sought to show how men might be saved I bring you another bring you now another shot cut down in the self-same field teaching you the great philosophy of salvation the hidden mystery this the great secret the wonderful discovery which is brought to light by the gospel how God is just and yet the justifier of the ungodly let us read the text again and then it once proceeded to discuss it he said I intend to do today as an in last Sunday I shall be just as simple as ever I can and I shall not attempt one single flight of eloquence or oratory even if I am capable of it but just go along the ground so that every simple soul may be able to understand for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him now I don't know what to think about that but I think that is lovely tonight amen and it's just a wonderful expression a wonderful thought that God has given us this evening and you know when we look at what God has done and and the message that he's given us in this hour and how that Grace has been expounded upon because we realize each one of us is seeming that without the grace of God without the grace of God you know sometimes we go down the street and we see somebody maybe ungodly dressed or doing ungodly things and we think my my what a condition but then we have to stop and think if it weren't for the grace of God there go I a man you know brother Branham had the the thought of you know leaving the ministry and going going to the mountains and not so much leaving the ministry I guess but just come out when the Lord would give him a word you know thus saith the Lord he'd come out and delivered and then he go back to the woods and and live his life there but you know the Lord opened his eyes and opened his understanding and let him see the old man there that favored him and you know I was old beard and scraggly looking fella and the Lord began to tell him if you do that you'll lose your wife you'll lose your family and all those things and and he began to realise if it wasn't for the grace of God there I would be a man so this evening we we want to look at the Word of God again and feel stand with me tonight and open to the book of Ephesians praise the Lord praise the Lord again it's just a real privilege to be here with you tonight and try to share something from the Word of God that would maybe help you along the way and be a blessing to you and that's we have nothing of our self as a minister we don't bring a revival or stirring in our pocket it's only by the grace of God tonight that that he gives us anything a man it's by His grace before we read tonight we just like to pray again and ask his blessings Heavenly Father God we're so grateful and so thankful this evening for your love and your mercy and your grace that you have shed abroad in our hearts and God we realize that without you tonight Lord we are nothing the Lord it's by your grace and by what you have done for us tonight Lord that we can recognize our position as the body of Christ we can recognize Lord that you have chosen us in you before the foundation of the world and you have you have made us meet to be partakers of this glorious gospel that you have seen this glorious salvation god I pray tonight your blessings upon this assembly but there Salman brother Wade and all the other brothers that labor with them all the layouts you lord the congregation as a whole Lord I know they love you with all their heart I know they want to serve you god I pray that you just strengthen each one with with that desire Lord and may it ever grow stronger in their lives may it never wane may it never falter but Lord until the coming of your son the Lord Jesus our Savior God made that desire and that burden grow stronger and stronger each day help us Lord every one to stand against the wiles of the wicked one and and be victorious in this hour so we thank you for these things now take the vessel this evening Lord move the men aside maybe speak through lips of clay and help us Lord to hear through the ears of understanding and and revelation tonight God that your word can become a living reality in our heart we thank you for these things bless the service again at home tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen reading this evening in first Ephesians chapter 1 and read verse 6 and we'll let you have your seats tonight and the writer wrote this he said to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved a man may the Lord at his blessings to the reading of the word this evening as you have your seats again we're just thrilled and happy to to be a part of God's great plan and happy and thrilled to be here with you and again we certainly appreciate the what warm welcome and invitation to come and fellowship with you today amen you know in in ourselves we think well what can I say what can I do but it's not what we can do but it's what he has done for us tonight amen so we look here and we realized the reason we're here tonight is because of the grace of God we realized this evening that as we said at the winding up this morning that he has chosen us and he has called us this evening for a purpose a man and and it's not our purpose but it's his purpose amen all things work together for the good of them that loved the Lord to them who are called according to his purpose and we realized that grace this evening is God's unmerited favor upon our lives in the way that we live and do and it's divine influence upon our hearts tonight that is reflected in the way that we live we act and we do and it has been termed God's unmerited favor now there's not a one of us sitting or standing here tonight that deserves God's favor we don't deserve it this morning because as we said we were born in sin shapen in iniquity as we come into the world speaking lies amen and we we understand that it's by him this evening and by His grace by him giving us that unmerited favor amen and as we as we realize and understand that God is His grace is God giving and showing favor tonight to someone who is completely and totally destitute of any merit of grace amen it's the bestowing of all the benefits of grace without any regards to one's goodness now god don't look at you and say well you're good you deserve grace you're not so good you don't deserve grace or you're this good and you deserve this much grace it's God giving you grace undeservedly tonight unmerited nothing you could do nothing you could pay a man it's nothing you could provide in exchange for it it's just God extending favor to you tonight Amen now it's not because you're smarter wiser richer or any more educated or more deserving or more you know more you know of anything to cause you to merit it more than anybody else because we're all in the same boat to not amen we're all without without hope except it be through Jesus Christ now we realize this evening that there's nothing we could do if we lived in this life 150 million years and each of those hundred and fifty million years we earned a hundred and fifty million dollars amen and we saved all those millions of dollars and we put it in a bank account let it grow interest and and accumulate an additional amount whenever it's all said and done at the hundred and fifty one millionth year we still wouldn't have enough money to by the grace of God amen we still wouldn't have enough resources we wouldn't have have done enough good it's not by what we have done it's what he has done Forrest is seen a man now the scripture tells us in first Corinthians 125 231 he said he said for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yes yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in Christ Jesus of who God who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it has written he that glorious let him glory in the Lord so we realized tonight that all glory belongs to God any good in you it only comes from God tonight it's not you being good but it's God in you now you know you look and you see people and you know you deal with people all the time and and you know you have some people that that are just plumb ugly so to speak they just never have a good thing to say they they're never happy they're never never settle in peace they have nothing amen and I want you to realize tonight if it weren't for God in your life you would be right there with them amen well brother Joe I'm an easygoing person I don't get upset too easy and all of that amen that may be true tonight but still without the grace of God in your life you'd be just like them amen that you you'd be in such a condition Amen that nobody would want to be around you you know maybe y'all don't have those kind of people in Georgia either that you just don't like to be around but then there's some people that my you just can't wait to get in their presence because you know that they are always going to be positive I know but the Sam is that way and when we have talked on the phone a couple times and arranging coming down and so forth and yesterday just to get the details worked out and you know when I asked him how you doing he said I'm always doing good I'm always feeling good I'm always just wonderfully man and I like that sometimes people ask me so how you doing I said well I'm doing good so good if I was any better I'd be twice as good in the world couldn't stand two of me amen so I'm doing good hey man so you know we've got to make a positive confession tonight because we do you realize we're little creators this evening brother madam told us that we have the ability to create a world and go live on it amen but I believe we can create a world right here and go live in it well how's that brother Joe by what you say amen by abide the words of your mouth because you are little creators tonight amen you know people will always want to to look at the downside of life well I you know how you're doing brother well you know I got up this morning this was hurtin that was certain this was broke that's going wrong this is happening over there and that's bad over yonder and that's seen you know what you're doing you're just projecting a bad attitude well let me just preach a little while tonight if that's all right amen we we this evening by the words of our mouths we are justified and by the words of our mouth we are condemned tonight amen now we can speak positive we can speak blessings or we can speak cursings amen but because we're sons and daughters of God we speak good things we speak positive things amen because we with there there's nothing in as we call it except Christ and Christ is good tonight so out of the abundance of our heart the mouth speaketh this evening amen so we go for it when they ask you how you doing I'm doing wonderful amen I'm the best I've ever been I'm happy I'm joyful I got the Lord in my life amen he's good to me and and I've got my little cap over there in the office he said God is good all the time God is good amen so I just you know I find myself many times you know looking at people and whenever you say things to them like that they kind of look at you sort of crossways and funny and they say well you know look at the condition you're in as I said this morning I'm not looking at the condition I'm looking at the conclusion and I know beyond a doubt and all of this is laid down amen there is therefore laid up for me a crown of righteousness amen in this old body that's that's getting a little older and getting little problems here and there and losing it sight losing its hair and losing this and losing that losing it strength thank God one day I'm gonna lay this one down and step into one that will never get tired anymore it'll never lose its hair it'll never lose its strength Amen it will be an eternal body Amen that's prepared in the heavens just for me I want to tell you you can't take my place you might want to but you came because it's prepared just for me amen oh why did God save you this evening was there anything in you that caused him to do it what Act did you perform that caused God to say I want to save this brother nothing amen what goodness did you demonstrate that move him to redeem you there was nothing amen there was no reason why he should have chosen you and listen he didn't just choose you you know the old song says I a new name and glory was written down the night I got saved well that song is a lie Amen because when I got saved it was before the foundation of the world I might have accepted on Friday night June the third or fourth right along in there 1974 I might have realized it and accepting what God had done for me but I want you to know it the mind of God I was saying before the foundation of the world and so were you this cement a man it wasn't on a Friday night or a Monday night or a Sunday night or Sunday morning it was before the foundation of the world your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen and all you had to do is catch up to that reality this evening and let it become real into your life tonight now the scripture said here to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved now the Greek word there translated accepted it's used only one other time in the scriptures and that's found in Luke chapter one verse 28 and the angel came in unto her and said hey o thou that art highly favoured or accepted and the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now I would like to bring that up to our date this evening Amen hail thou that art highly favoured or accepted of God listen amen Mary didn't have not one thing to do with it brother Branham described as maybe her and Joseph were reading the the scrolls together and just going over the prophecies of Isaiah amen have read the scripture there where it said behold the Virgin shall conceive and you know maybe something just moved over her and and she was just thinking wow what wouldn't what a glorious thing that God is going to do he's going to come down amen and and be born in and a little baby and and B being become a child and this legend is going to bring forth a child never knowing a man now can you imagine the thoughts that must have went through their mind amen as they just mulled over and Heist over those thoughts and then the next morning as brother Branham described it going down to the will a meant to get the water for for the home there and as she was going around the corner there stood Gabriel the mighty angel and said Hail Mary thou wert highly favored of God well I want to tell you this evening saints of God amen we not a bit might not have gone down to the whale but in this generation there has been a mighty angel amen that's come down once again and said hail bride you're highly favorite of God and that which will be conceived in you is all the holy ghost tonight amen and you will bring forth the Son of God afresh in this hour Amen what am i favored people we are and as I said that word favored I accepted they men accepted in the beloved this evening not in our merits but what he has done for us tonight amen what a what a blessed thought that he is our accepting acceptance rather it's not future tense he's right now Amen it's not it's not something that's going to be it is an accomplished fact tonight Amen it's already done I have to do this it's a beautiful illustration let me see I can't see I got a $20 bill I'm gonna give it to somebody now the choice is mine and there's nobody here that's done anything for it there's nobody here that well you might think you deserve it but you know it's not up to you it's my choice all right let's see who am I gonna give it to tonight is it Thomas Tommy Thomas would you come and get this $20 bill okay go buy you some ice cream or something okay now you see how easy it is to get something from God he believed I was going to give it to him and God has already told us what he has done for us and what he has given us and all we've got to do is like Thomas get up out of our seed of doubt and confusion and say Lord you said it I'm gonna take it for myself it's mine tonight now I've used that illustration quite a few times and a lot of times the kids with Sam they'll look at mama really yeah they're looking daddy is he gonna give me that if I go up there you know with that kind of a mentality and you know what to do they set there many times long enough to well I said all right you're not gonna come all right I'm gonna pick somebody else and that's exactly tonight what God does if we sit there in our seat and say well I'm not sure God goes and find somebody else that will accept his word and it gives them the benefit of that tonight Amen so that illustration works anyway it comes out tonight amen but you know we have got to come to the place to where we realize God has said it God will do what he said he will do Amen it's up to us tonight to take him at his word and receive what he said amen now the scripture tells us in Jeremiah 31 and 3 said the Lord appeared of old unto me saying yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving-kindness have i drawn thee now a lot of people say well I sought the Lord and I sought the Lord but I want you to realize take it all the way back to the book of Genesis amen man does not seek God God seeks out man when Adam and Eve were hiding themselves because sin came into the picture God said Adam madam where art thou he meant God salt man but man does not see God because man a man is full of sin in himself amen in that regard tonight now I know we pray and we call out to God but in that measure are looking for God when we're in sin tonight we don't go looking for him he comes seeking us out tonight amen and I'm so glad that he did well maybe the rest of you'll catch that revelation after a while I'm so glad that he did come seeking me amen because I needed a savior tonight I needed a redeemer I needed somebody that couldn't pay the price that I couldn't pay I needed somebody amen not only that could pay the price but was willing to pay the price amen we look at Ruth in the Old Testament and there was a nearer kinsman a man that could have redeemed her which we realized tonight a man in our standpoint it's the devil amen he could have redeemed us he had a claim on us amen but because they met at Woodmoor his testimony it would mess up his program he couldn't do it tonight but all thank God Boaz he reached them he said I'm willing I'm able and I will this evening and our boy ask the Lord Jesus amen he was we're ready willing and able and he has redeemed us tonight out of the pawnshop of sin amen now the scripture tells us in John 15 9 as the father hath loved me so ever I loved you continue you in my love so tonight we're continuing in the love of God and allowing that love to express through us this evening now I wants to consider something found in Hebrews chapter 7 7 to 10 and without all the without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as I may so say Levi also received tithes eight times in Abraham for he was yet in the Lords of his father when Melchizedek met him now when I asked you the question do you think that Levi literally physically paid tithes to Melchizedek when he wasn't even born no not physically not literally but it was imputed to him it was laid to his account if you will a man he never actually a man paid tithes but he was in his father Abraham a man and in him he paid tithes to Melchizedek now listen tonight we never paid the debt of sin yet it's credited to our account this evening amen because he he Levi was in the loins of Abraham we were in the loins of the Lord Jesus tonight we were in him when he died on Calvary we were in him when he died before the foundation of the world in the mind of God so therefore in him amen we have been accepted all the Lord tonight amen now we look at that and we realized Amen that that that gives us dying grace tonight to realize that we have been accepting not wondering Amen will they accept me when I stand before him on that great day he has already accepted me praise the Lord he has already accepted me this evening like the the worshiper in the Old Testament he had to bring his lamb or his turtle dove and he had to identify with that lamb and I know you've been told all these things but you haven't heard it from me so just listen tonight amen he he had to identify brother Sam lay his hands up on the head of that lamb as the priest slit his throat and the blood ran out what was he doing he was saying this lamb is dying in my stead tonight his blood is pouring out that should be my blood but thank God there is a substitute tonight and I want to realize we have a substitute his blood spilled on Calvary and we identify with him we lay our hands upon his head and upon the finished work of Calvary tonight and because of that we are already accepted in the beloved this evening amen now I may be poor but I'm accepted in the beloved I may be uneducated but I'm accepted in the beloved I may be crippled up but I am accepted tonight in the beloved I may be blind but I am accepted this evening in Christ Jesus amen when death comes knocking on your door ready to do it's worse you tell him Amen I fear you not death because I know Amen that I have been redeemed I have been accepted in the beloved amen and I've got nothing to worry about because he took my place he took my sins up on him tonight and he paid the price that I couldn't pay so death come on and take me home what what does that do to a child of God it just carries you into the presence of God we as believers we we shouldn't fear death all we fear the unknown what's it like what's going to happen what what what what kind of pain is it going to be you know sister Dow we've heard sister Dow by the DAO sister Dow undertakes brother Dan asked her talk to her sister Dowell sits you talked to brother Branham and she'd asked brother Branham said brother Branham what's it gonna be like when the rapture takes place and brother Bentham she said brother Bentham told her said well sister Gladys said when the rapture takes place because this old flesh cannot inherit eternal life this place has to die so it will be like a quick sharp pain and it'll be over with don't get quiet on me now because this flash has to be changed it has to die because why it was born in sin shapen iniquity conceived coming to the world speaking lies amen so it cannot eternal inherit eternal life there has to be a change he men and all I'm so glad a man that there is one already prepared for me tonight a man that when this one is done away with there's one I can step right into this evening and it's a glorious body fashioned like unto his glorious body tonight amen now we are manifested examples of the grace of God this evening in our lives living examples of God's grace now I don't know you like I know me but you don't know me like you know you and you know where you came from and you know the road you was traveling on and you know where you were headed now you know a lot of people look at me and say brother Joel you never went out in the world I was raised in church since I was a little bitty baby you never went out in the world you never drank you never smoked done all those things that a lot of people do but you know what I was just as lost as anybody else amen I was just as on my road to hell as anybody was because I had not been born again amen but when God came into my life amen had changed me what was that it was the grace of God the unmerited favor of God extended to me now you may have been the worst drunk you may be in the worst drug addict you may be the worst this or that the other amen but it took no more grace for you than it did for me tonight the same saving grace amen the same grace tonight that was saved me amen born and raised in church all my life but yet in need of a savior Amen you might have been the drunk or the prostitute or whatever you were amen the drug-addict I don't know and and I don't want to know Amen but God knows and you knew Amen but thank God because you accepted his propitiation now now God don't even know what you were all he sees is you're a son or daughter of God how can he do that because he throws your sins in the sea of forgetfulness never ever ever to remember them against you again tonight Amen so when God opens the book and looks and that Satan comes accusing you and saying did you know this rather did that did you know that sister did that and God pulls up the screen you know what he sees a blank piece of paper a blank screen tonight there's nothing there Amen to accuse you of nothing there to condemn you of because it's all underneath the blood of Jesus Christ amen it cannot be remembered against you again amen well brother Joe how come the devil comes up and he showed because it's really his sin it's really belongs to him tonight and he can remember all of that amen and he brings it tries to make your mind Mull it over and think about it amen but when he comes and does that brother Sam what do we do we don't just sit there and dwell on it and and you know sometimes we have to fight those things well maybe that's the North Carolina thing too he comes and he brings those things up and you know he's gay he had 3d Living Color long before NBC did or Sony or whoever invented it and he brings those things up and he begins to roll that in your mind and you know the first thing you know you begin to oh yeah oh God and if we're not careful we'll let that thing begin to play and that's what the devil wants us to do right he wants to just let it keep playing and then you know what he's doing he's getting us sidetracked and getting us into a position to where we if we're not careful amen when that takes over our mind what are we gonna do we're gonna go do it again but thank God amen for the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight because when that feeling begins to roll you know what the whole egos come down and convince you that it says that's not you that's uh that's somebody else that belongs to the devil you have been cleared of those things it's not on your record it's not yours amen the screen is blank tonight and there's nothing there against you because it's been done away with by the blood of Jesus Christ tonight it's a clean slate this evening now grace makes the most unaccepted among men acceptable among the notables of heaven a redeemed prostitute is made higher than the Angels the angle is not a son of God they're a created being created to serve God to worship God to carry out his orders but they have never been redeemed amen they don't know what Amazing Grace how sweet the sound means tonight amen because they have never been lost in sin they have never stooped that low amen they are holy angels and they stand before God crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty they don't know what it means to be lost and be redeemed but you and I do tonight amen and we buy that knowledge and buy that reality in our lives we can worship God oh how I love Jesus because He first loved me Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but thank God now I see and we can sing that with the reality because it has happened to us tonight amen but the angels they don't know nothing about that a drunkards name is whispered among the population of heaven no one becomes as someone all because of grace remember tonight salvation is of the Lord it's only because of God's grace that we can stand in the presence of a holy and just God unconditionally how speaking some of these things and I had the brother to lower the screen I said now turn the projector on and when he turned the projector on it was just a blank screen I said do you realize that's what the blood of Jesus Christ has done for you he has wiped it clean tonight now when they brought that lamb and they lay their hands on him and felt the the pulsation of the blood running out that life of that lamb could not come back into the believer oh but let me tell you when Jesus Christ died on Calvary his life tonight has come back on the day of Pentecost and it ends well the believer and it's been doing it to those that believe those that obey the Word of God is that life is still coming into the believers today amen because that life is in you what is it done it has driven out the very desire for sin amen and you don't desire the things that you used to desire tonight I want you to understand I smoked all I want to Oprah through Joe oh don't get excited about that I drink all the will to to I curse lie cheat and steal all I want to commit adultery all those other things all that I want to but thank God on a Friday night a long time ago something got ahold of this heart and it took the desire for those things out of me tonight and I lo longer amen have a desire to drink I no longer desire to smoke I no longer desire to do the things of the world why there has been a change in me amen and I have accepted what he has done in my life and recognized tonight it's grace grace I stand there crying grace tonight amen recognizing that in myself amen i I'm doomed I'm condemned but thank God Amen we we look on that and we recognize that he hath made us worthy this evening if you all had the faith of Abraham the seal of all the prophets all the good works of all the apostles you'd still need the grace of God amen brother Ram tells us in the visible union he said one of the books I read Oh mr. Dwight Moody that moody after reading Romans seven ran to the street and the first man he met he said to him do you know grace and the man replied grace who and mr. moody said the grace of God so it is so thrilled him when he saw or when he seen how Grace have separated us from the law and what part grace fled he said I always told the people when I crossed the line on the other side I'd like to stand up and sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me grace precious grace none more of grace to know for it is by grace where save not but what we can do what we can whatever we do is not accounted to us grace is what saves us it's by grace are you saved through faith it doesn't curse say that grace has made us acceptable and you know what acceptable means it'll be okay if if rather Sam and I make an agreement and and we have a contract then we have to sit down we have to iron out and bring it to a place to where both sides will accept the contract if he's gonna do a job for me he has to be willing to accept what I offer him and I have to be willing to accept that the the quality of labor which I know would be good that he would provide so that means that the contract is acceptable we can work from that amen but that's not what the scripture says the scripture says you are accepted and the word accepted means it's already completed it's already done tonight it's already a finished work Messina you have been accepted now brother Thomas back there amen he he heard about a gift he heard about a $20 bill and listen he didn't just sit there he looked at me and kind of hesitated just a minute then he got on up out of his seat and come on up and he accepted what I had given it you know it would be acceptable for anybody to come amen but it wasn't given to you it was given to him tonight and God has offered it to the whole world but it's not acceptable to them they won't accept it but thank God before the foundation the world God knew that you would accept it tonight amen and they presented to you you receive it and it has changed your life this evening and giving you a new perspective and let you realize Amen that you are a part of God's great economy this evening seasons one in seven in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace so it's His grace tonight that has expounded to us and and given us the seamen hope amen and as we look at that we break it down a little bit in whom in him amen and by him and no one else because he alone tonight has the redemption price and can pay that price tonight through the instrument of his blood amen the redemption price and and it's only through that that we have redemption this evening amen what is redemption it's full and total deliverance both body and spirit and so by the paying of a ransom I can go and take my watch to go down to the local pawn shop and I can say sir I need a little money would you pull this watch or take this watch on ponies say yes sir said I'll give you so many dollars twenty dollars fifty dollars whatever it is that's wonderful okay said now when you come pick it up you got to have this ticket and you got to have the the long price plus an interest and you can get your what's back amen now when I go down there with the ticket and with the redemption price which is you know the way it works you got to have the purchase price to what you borrow plus their and their interest which is the redemption price amen and present that to the storekeeper and say here's the ticket and here's the redemption price I want my watch and that man cannot go over to brother Sam or brother than the thing then let's say give me your watch and let me give it to brother Joe because he has paid the price for his watch that's not how it works like brother Brenham described me he said now if I take this book and I drop it on the floor amen and I go over here and I pick up this book and say I've redeemed that book that wouldn't be right amen I have to pick this book up and plan and lift it up and pay the price of my price to get it back with the reach down and get it amen and that's what God has done he reached further down than you could reach up tonight and he redeems you out of the pawn shop of seeing a man not another but you you were lost you were sold in the pawn shop and he had the price and he redeemed you this evening that brought you back and restored you to your rightful position this evening man's not redeemable by another man for all men Amen or in the devil's pawn shop this evening a man that have not been redeemed the same price is on their body soul and spirit this evening right same price Amen everybody is in under the same conditions this evening Psalms 151 and five said behold I was shapen in iniquity and sin did my mother conceive me I remember Redemption is through the blood not just any blood but his blood amen the blood of God which he has shared for his own church amen Romans 5 and 9 he said much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from the wrath through him man now a lot of people when it comes time for communion and again this might be a North Carolina thing I'm not sure but when when it comes time for communion half the church stays home well you know like I said maybe it's a North Carolina thing and many times you talk to people why won't you come and take community enough newsflash you never will be I'm sorry to tell you you never will be well you know I've got this thing well you know how hard it is brother if I offended you I'm sorry I didn't know it's done and then what you can come to the community table I guess they had North Carolina thing but people make it so hard jesus said scripture says I should say if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and that advocate you know a few years ago quite a few years ago thankfully I got a speeding ticket I was on my way to church back when I had a few sprigs of hair and I was in a car that we had just traded for and I wasn't used to it the way it's drove and handle and everything and we were on our way to church and I was gonna preach that morning wanna see him and I was kind of trying to straighten up my couple of hairs on top and and be presentable and the next thing you know I was doing let's see I think it was about 75 and a 55 more than 15 over which is not a good thing so all of a sudden I saw the blue light and heard the siren and I pulled over and the officer come up and said sir you in a hurry I said well no I'm going to church you know I just didn't realize the new car didn't realize it was speeding up like that he said okay said well now you were doing so much speed in the certain zone and he said you know he said you know I could take your license on the spot I said yes sir I realized that honest mistake I didn't mean to do it so anyway long story short I contacted a lawyer an advocate and that advocate for a price he said you won't even have to appear in court I'll handle it for you and he did I didn't have to go to the courthouse I didn't have to go and appear before the judge I didn't have to stand there and see the officer and the officer accused me and all those things my lawyer handled the case I want to change that we have an advocate and our lawyer handled the case tonight and listen we didn't have to pay him a dime he did it as an unmerited favor to you and I this evening he paid the prize he judicata the the case tonight he plead plead our cause and he made a way listen not only did he adjudicate or or plead our case he paid the fine this evening and made it so that it's not even on our record anymore amen Romans sorry we read that one Colossians 1 in 14 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins a man we have redemption and our sins are forgiven when we used to go up to brother Paget's up in the mountain brother Stewart was there and I just love to hear brother Stewart sing and he would sing just if justify I never did it in the first place justified amen and and and what does that mean it means that it's just as if I've never done it in the first place and that's the way my record looks tonight clean and white I never did it in the first place to see don't forget what brother Branham told us this evening this is what God accomplished for us way back in the eternity before the foundation of the world God laid it all out and and in his great mind listen when God first said let the earth bring forth you know what brother Joel was already justified brother Joe was already sanctified brother Joel was already glorified amen already redeemed by the blood of the Lamb well how can that be brother Joe Jesus hadn't died yet physically he hadn't but in the mind of God and I want to tell you as I stated while ago I was going to give that $20 away sometimes I'll just say that and I'll just wait on somebody to catch the revelation you saw me do that direct brother Josh's brother Joe I held it up us and I'm gonna give this away didn't have a 20 I think I had a couple of five so I'm gonna give this away to somebody tonight and they just looked and I kept saying it I'm gonna give this away I'm gonna give this away I'm gonna give this away and finally somebody caught the revelation and they stood up and they come and got it gonna say and I want to tell you tonight you know what God has given salvation God has given Redemption and all he's waiting on is for somebody to come and take hold of it tonight amen well brother Joe we know that only those that have been elected of God can be redeemed but I want to tell you hey man there's gonna be all those that's outside the city what are they they've been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ they may not be the bride by the Sam but they're gonna be there just the same that's that's how we can look back at our children that are lost and maybe they're going and maybe they're going we don't see how God's gonna do it it's not up to us to do it but we know that they will be there because God has promised how is it gonna do it that's not up to me right just in case you're thinking it's not up to you either thank God he has made the promise and he will make provision and bring it to pass tonight a man stand with me this evening if you will in the sardian church aids whether Adam said first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purchased purposed rather in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was for known and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood that was the ransom price paid for her and she can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because she a sin cannot be imputed unto her Romans 4 Nate blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in the section of the book of life before the fact the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Wow how we ought to rejoice tonight how we ought to thank God amen you know when John wept because no one was found worthy and then the lamb prevailed the Lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed and the lamb has taken the book and loosed the seals thereof amen why did John get so excited why was he rejoicing as we understand it because when that book was open he saw his name listen tonight the the book has been open to us tonight and we see our name in the Lamb's Book of Life this evening amen and and and we as does the redeemed of the Lord oh my we ought to go down the street tomorrow telling everybody I am redeemed by love divine glory glory Christ his mind all

of the Lamb it's by him that I can stand here with hope this evening Amen it's by him that I can testify I am a part of the bride of Jesus Christ tonight it's by him and through him I can stand here and proclaim victory tonight in Jesus and it's through him and by him that I can say my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world tonight amen we have been
