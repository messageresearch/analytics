[0:00] the lord it's good to be back in the
[0:02] house the lord good to have the
[0:04] everybody back brother luis is gone
[0:06] preaching in uh jacksonville i think it
[0:08] is and brother boyd's on vacation so
[0:10] they're the ones that are not
[0:11] with us today so today we're going to
[0:13] continue our little thought on prayer i
[0:15] told you we were just going to pick one
[0:17] word but aaron did a wonderful job it
[0:18] was a miracle he spoke less than 15
[0:20] minutes
[0:21] so that's okay he's learning
[0:27] so let's get in we're going to pick one
[0:29] word and that's what we're going to
[0:30] continue on and we
[0:32] looked at prayer and now prayer remember
[0:34] is
[0:36] an invocation or an act that seeks to
[0:38] activate a rapport with an object of
[0:39] worship through deliberate communication
[0:42] in a narrow sense the term refers to an
[0:44] act of supplication or intercession
[0:46] directed toward a deity or deified and
[0:49] deified ancestor uh we're not doing that
[0:53] okay that's just a that's just the
[0:55] definition
[0:56] but we are our our prayer remember we
[0:59] were talking about in in the garden
[1:00] before
[1:01] the fall before sin happened there was
[1:04] no prayer
[1:05] there was no such need for prayer god
[1:08] spoke to adam lip to ear
[1:11] personally god god even spoke to cain
[1:15] they didn't have to pray to a god there
[1:16] was no intercessor there there was
[1:18] nothing that
[1:19] that they needed because god was right
[1:20] there with him the whole time but then
[1:22] when sin happened
[1:24] we know that it separated and then now
[1:27] there had to be a rapport
[1:28] as this talks about between an object of
[1:31] worship
[1:31] through deliberate communication so we
[1:34] know as the bride of jesus christ we
[1:35] know who we're praying to
[1:37] amen and as we were covering the other
[1:39] day and we talked about a little bit in
[1:41] the
[1:41] uh bible study last night about a the
[1:44] prayer of a bob-haired woman
[1:46] cannot be heard from god except for her
[1:48] salvation
[1:49] now that's hard to understand but it's
[1:51] in the bible the bible says she
[1:53] dishonored her head if she prays with
[1:55] her head uncovered
[1:56] which would not be a hat on that would
[1:57] mean that she would be cutting her hair
[1:59] now see that wasn't
[2:01] that so you say well what was brother
[2:03] that wasn't brother branham's idea
[2:05] it came from the bible right okay i
[2:08] don't know where people get off that
[2:09] that they won't listen to the to the
[2:11] prophet to god in the end time
[2:13] he's just quoting you the bible right
[2:15] everybody's like get back to the bible
[2:17] get like brother daniel somebody
[2:18] and i've heard him we got to get back to
[2:20] the bible we never left the
[2:22] bible the true bride never left the
[2:24] bible it became more clear when the
[2:26] prophet came on the scene
[2:28] that now i'm not praying to a second
[2:30] person
[2:31] of a trinity i'm praying to my father
[2:34] i'm praying to god almighty
[2:36] i'm not praying through somebody who's
[2:38] praying through somebody
[2:39] and you know what the bible even tells
[2:41] us that jesus christ is our inner
[2:42] is our mediator but remember he's not a
[2:45] second person he's almighty god
[2:48] if you walk into the courtroom of of god
[2:50] almighty
[2:51] you see jesus and then if you look over
[2:54] and see the prosecuting attorney
[2:56] that's the devil but you see the person
[2:58] that's for your defense that's jesus
[3:00] and you look over there in the in the uh
[3:03] witness stand and you look over there in
[3:05] the
[3:05] in the jury box and there's that's jesus
[3:08] so you can't lose folks
[3:10] so that's who we pray to we don't pray
[3:12] to another deity or another deified
[3:15] person like even the
[3:17] the catholic tells us you know we need
[3:18] to pray to this certain saint because he
[3:20] walked 25 miles
[3:22] a day and we need to pray to that saint
[3:23] when we travel there's no such
[3:27] brother brown said that was spiritualism
[3:29] so we know that's not
[3:30] what we're doing as the bride of jesus
[3:32] christ we can go to god
[3:34] you women sisters that don't cut your
[3:36] hair you can go to god for anything you
[3:38] ask for
[3:39] just as good as the man
[3:43] just as good as the men your prayer is
[3:45] heard there's no
[3:46] gender prayer
[3:49] everybody get into all this gender stuff
[3:51] this day and time
[3:52] we are the only people that know who we
[3:54] are who we come where we come from and
[3:56] what we're doing here
[3:58] but let's go to genesis the first time
[3:59] now look in genesis 13 verse 8 just for
[4:02] some of the ones that haven't been here
[4:04] it says abram said unto lot there there
[4:06] be no strife i pray thee now that's not
[4:08] a prayer
[4:10] that's a statement that's a statement
[4:12] that says
[4:13] please or used in in treaty or
[4:15] exhortation so in other words
[4:17] i pray that y'all made it to church
[4:19] today or we actually did pray but
[4:21] it's a statement but the first real
[4:23] prayer
[4:24] we look in genesis 20 verse 7 and it's a
[4:28] prayer
[4:29] that got a man out of trouble
[4:32] right this is abraham praying for
[4:35] abimelech
[4:37] that god wouldn't destroy his country
[4:41] right right now therefore restore the
[4:43] man his wife
[4:44] remember we would think abraham would be
[4:46] in the wrong because he's the one to
[4:48] give his wife away
[4:50] but god said you've got to go listen to
[4:52] my prophet and he's got to pray a prayer
[4:54] for you
[4:56] to jehovah to restore back
[4:59] because look surely thou shalt die
[5:01] that's the first prayer in the bible
[5:04] that abram or abraham was praying to god
[5:07] to entreat or i mean not to entreat but
[5:10] to
[5:10] ask forgiveness from this fellow over
[5:13] here so
[5:14] that is to intercede or to pray when we
[5:17] do this
[5:18] when we pray we are intervening
[5:21] remember the prophet of god and we'll
[5:22] read it a little bit later on the
[5:23] prophet of god tells us that
[5:25] that's the most powerful thing you can't
[5:27] go we couldn't go to zach black
[5:30] two years ago and say zach you got to be
[5:32] saved you got to be saved well it just
[5:33] was like okay that's fine
[5:35] because it happened to me but the prayer
[5:37] that you had in your closet the prayer
[5:39] that bob got on his knees and sister
[5:41] monica and all the different ones
[5:43] were praying for him we were interceding
[5:45] for him
[5:47] amen to jesus christ
[5:50] to save his soul because we can't save
[5:52] him that's why there had to be prayer
[5:54] because
[5:55] here's adam and here's god and when
[5:57] genesis 3 15 he said i'll put enmity or
[6:00] division in other words i can't speak
[6:02] like i want to speak to you anymore
[6:05] but you can pray there's a thing called
[6:08] prayer
[6:09] look in genesis 20 verse 17 this is so
[6:12] abraham prayed unto god
[6:14] and god healed the bible his wife and
[6:16] maidservant and they bear
[6:18] children so abraham prayed to god for
[6:21] this
[6:22] king that was getting ready to make a
[6:23] mistake then also numbers 11 verse 2
[6:27] the people cried unto moses when moses
[6:29] prayed unto the lord
[6:30] the fire was cri was quenched so here is
[6:33] moses
[6:34] now look you see in the old testament
[6:35] there is a lot of prayer of intercession
[6:38] because there was not a don't get me
[6:40] wrong there was not a jesus christ that
[6:41] they knew
[6:43] they didn't know jesus christ in the old
[6:44] testament he hadn't developed into that
[6:46] yet he was jehovah
[6:48] he was this god you couldn't touch he
[6:50] was just god that you had to go into
[6:51] this building you had to go behind this
[6:53] veil
[6:54] you had to go do this you had to do this
[6:55] you had to do the ten commandments you
[6:57] had to
[6:57] put this on right and you had to be you
[6:59] know you had to have the oil on your
[7:00] head and you had all these do's and
[7:02] don'ts
[7:03] to meet god but now when we get into the
[7:05] new testament
[7:06] we're going to tell you what jesus told
[7:08] how he told us to pray
[7:10] our father who art in heaven hallowed be
[7:13] thy name
[7:13] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[7:16] earth as it is in heaven
[7:18] give us this day our daily bread he told
[7:19] us how to pray
[7:21] why because the the intercessor was
[7:23] standing right there in front of them
[7:25] telling them that you pray what i'll
[7:27] send the comforter
[7:29] in my name or in the father's name and
[7:31] you pray
[7:32] not to me that i'll pray to the father
[7:36] no i thought we looked in matthew and
[7:38] we're skipping over real quick to get
[7:40] over there matthew
[7:41] it says that jesus prayed for
[7:45] us to me that's the real lord's prayer
[7:48] for the bride
[7:50] in john 17 when he said lord i pray that
[7:52] they may be
[7:53] one me and them be one as you and i are
[7:56] one well now were they
[7:58] separate people no they were the same
[8:00] that's our problem we think we're
[8:03] inferior to god or we are some second
[8:05] person
[8:09] that's our problem that's why we've been
[8:10] here it's not because of anything else
[8:12] it's just we don't realize who we are
[8:14] that's right
[8:15] that we're not a second person listen if
[8:17] you're like god you're the devil
[8:20] if you're a second person from god
[8:21] you're the devil the brother said
[8:23] there's only two people you've got to
[8:24] worry about
[8:25] god in the devil amen so you know you're
[8:27] either one of the two
[8:28] you're not an in-between in other words
[8:30] the bride is not another person separate
[8:32] from god
[8:35] we got to realize that folks go that's
[8:38] what he said
[8:40] there in john when he was interceding
[8:42] let's turn straight to that if you don't
[8:44] mind we'll
[8:44] we'll get over to john 17 9.
[8:49] everybody wants to know what this great
[8:51] uh this end time is
[8:53] has in store for us you'll have to head
[8:56] on over there pretty good
[8:57] pretty good ways there brother
[9:00] john 17 9 just keep going you good
[9:04] it says i pray for them i pray not for
[9:06] the world but for them which thou has
[9:09] given me
[9:10] for they are thine and then he continues
[9:13] on with thine or mine and mine are thine
[9:15] and that they may be what the same
[9:20] i pray not for the world see we don't we
[9:23] shouldn't pray for the world
[9:24] what are you going to pray for something
[9:26] that's already condemned
[9:28] you can't pray for something sure you
[9:29] can pray for your family and your
[9:30] friends and the people around you
[9:32] and your job and all these different
[9:33] things but forget about praying for
[9:35] who's in the office
[9:36] amen why it's already condemned it can't
[9:39] get any better
[9:41] it can only get worse so in john 17
[9:45] that whole chapter there jesus is
[9:47] praying
[9:48] for the bride he's praying for me and
[9:51] you he's praying he didn't
[9:53] and he didn't say lord take him out of
[9:56] this world
[9:56] no what'd he say lord they're going to
[9:59] stay in this world
[10:00] but you protect them right now what is
[10:03] our protection
[10:04] jesus christ is our protection because
[10:06] we pray to him we know who to pray to
[10:09] not to a second person of a trinity
[10:12] matthew 21 verse 22 do not go there but
[10:14] it says whatever things you ask in
[10:16] prayer
[10:16] believe you shall receive it believe
[10:20] you shall receive it amen
[10:24] and then the bible tells us when we
[10:25] stand praying forgive
[10:27] have you ever done that before oh it's
[10:29] real easy to pray for somebody you like
[10:32] but what about paying for praying for
[10:33] somebody that almost run you off the
[10:35] road or pray for somebody that's
[10:37] despitefully using you
[10:38] and at work or first one thing in
[10:40] another that's why i said the
[10:42] the brotherly kindness is way up there
[10:45] it's easy to love people that love you
[10:47] but what about love people that hate you
[10:49] and literally pray for them
[10:51] that they'll do good pray for them that
[10:53] they'll do good
[10:56] oh no lord no lord i can't do that
[10:59] they've been mean to me
[11:01] pitiful you you need to go up that
[11:03] statue of perfect manner you need to get
[11:04] the new birth first
[11:06] amen that's what i told them over
[11:09] brother pageants i said look
[11:10] there's a lot of things that we're that
[11:12] we're teaching now
[11:13] not just us and i'm talking about the
[11:15] bride in general that if you don't have
[11:16] the new birth you're not going to
[11:17] understand it
[11:20] you're just not going to understand it
[11:24] i'm sorry but if you'll get the new
[11:26] birth god promised he'd do
[11:28] these things for you but he didn't
[11:29] promise you do you do them for you if
[11:30] you just sit there in
[11:31] in la la land or in sanctification or
[11:34] justification he said he would
[11:36] what he would feed his children
[11:39] not rocks not scorpions he said he would
[11:43] feed them bread
[11:44] he would sustain them through life our
[11:48] problem is there's a lot of people that
[11:49] are not born again
[11:52] they think they are but see that's the
[11:54] age brother russ was uh we were
[11:56] conversing this morning by text and
[11:58] that was his whole thing he he says i
[12:01] almost cry when you look at people that
[12:02] are so
[12:03] they're so caught up in the world not
[12:06] world but i mean caught up in
[12:07] denomination that they think that's
[12:08] right and they're praying straight to
[12:09] the devil
[12:13] because god's not in that folks now
[12:15] he'll save a hungry soul but if that
[12:17] hunger soul gets in your birth he won't
[12:18] stay in that denomination i'll promise
[12:20] you that
[12:21] he won't question the prophet i'll
[12:23] promise you that
[12:25] you might have questions but if you
[12:27] question the prophet
[12:28] you ain't born again
[12:32] if we start right there maybe we'll be
[12:34] all right
[12:38] just the way it is we'll talk about that
[12:39] this afternoon because listen
[12:41] god sent us a messenger and if william
[12:43] branham is not that messenger
[12:45] then you know what if i miss it and i'll
[12:48] go to before the judgment
[12:50] because if i miss it i will go before
[12:51] the judgment i'm going to go to malachi
[12:54] 4 and say look you promised you'd send
[12:55] me elijah and you turned my heart back
[12:57] where was he and where is he
[12:58] you know what he's going to say to them
[13:00] people i sent you william branham
[13:04] wow sorry that's just the way it is
[13:08] look in acts 1 verse 14.
[13:13] these all continued with one accord in
[13:15] prayer and supplication
[13:17] i want to ask you a question this
[13:19] morning how many of you have started
[13:21] praying for our meeting in july
[13:27] the success of that meeting will come
[13:29] from your prayer
[13:33] brother brown said the success of his
[13:35] meeting was two women in a in a closet
[13:37] praying
[13:38] that the meeting would go well wow two
[13:40] women yeah they were holy ghost-filled
[13:42] women i'm sure
[13:43] because god heard their prayer amen so
[13:45] you start praying for this thing coming
[13:47] up that will all do the right thing
[13:49] it'll all be done in
[13:50] order and that people will have a good
[13:52] time
[13:53] look in acts 4 verse 31 and when they
[13:56] had prayed
[13:57] the place was shaken where they were
[13:59] assembled together
[14:00] and they were all filled with the holy
[14:02] ghost and spake the word of god
[14:05] with boldness let's go to romans 8 verse
[14:07] 26
[14:10] and likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[14:12] infirmities
[14:13] for we know not what we should pray for
[14:15] as we ought
[14:17] but the spirit itself maketh intersec
[14:19] intercession for us
[14:21] with groanings which not cannot be
[14:23] uttered how many of you have had an
[14:24] unction to pray for somebody
[14:26] how many of you have got up at night and
[14:27] a name come upon you
[14:29] your heart and you just start praying
[14:30] for him and then knowing later on that
[14:32] that person was going through a trial
[14:34] at that very moment why it was god
[14:37] wanted you to pray
[14:40] god wanted you to pray for them they
[14:41] need a prayer you know you've heard dad
[14:42] many times and i tell you when
[14:44] when i used to have migraine headaches i
[14:47] couldn't pray
[14:49] if you ever had a real good migraine you
[14:51] don't do nothing but try to survive
[14:53] you get in the coldest room you can find
[14:55] put something on your eyes and tell
[14:57] everybody leave me alone
[14:59] but i'm dependent on somebody to pray
[15:01] for me that's why we have the
[15:02] prayer list that's why we have the wall
[15:04] downstairs with the people
[15:06] that's why brother terence reads these
[15:08] prayer requests every sunday
[15:09] because it gives you something to pray
[15:11] about gives you something to pray for
[15:13] somebody some brother even somebody you
[15:15] don't even know
[15:17] you know if the if the philippines come
[15:19] on your heart just start praying
[15:20] you don't have to call listen we
[15:23] jesus told us right here somewhere he
[15:26] said don't be in these long prayers
[15:28] i read it to you a while back he said
[15:31] don't be like the pharisees
[15:34] he said you don't have to pray for
[15:36] everything pray for what you
[15:38] specifically need to
[15:39] but oh it's matthew 6 verse 5 when thou
[15:42] prayest enter into thy closet
[15:44] and when you shut the door pray to thy
[15:45] father in secret that's when you have
[15:47] time alone with god that's your prayer
[15:49] life you say well i even met a lady
[15:52] yesterday at the
[15:54] at the yard sale that benefit yard sale
[15:56] that
[15:57] that we were doing for that lady that
[15:58] got hit by a drunk driver but
[16:00] we we got to talking about that she said
[16:02] oh yeah i pray without ceasing she said
[16:04] i pray now i'm praying now
[16:06] something come on the heart she just
[16:07] says lord just be with this person and
[16:08] she was a
[16:09] a nominal christian lady but that's what
[16:11] you should do but when thou prayest
[16:13] enter into that closet shut the door
[16:15] pray to thy father which is in secret
[16:16] now father which seeth thee in secret
[16:18] shall we
[16:19] reward the openly see the two ladies
[16:21] didn't stand up in the meeting
[16:23] and start praying that the whole meeting
[16:25] would know them two women are the ones
[16:27] that made that success of that meeting
[16:30] no they prayed in the closet but it got
[16:33] the attention of god
[16:35] that he had a prophet on the scene that
[16:38] discerned what was going on and come out
[16:40] and told the people then afterwards
[16:43] the success of this meeting was because
[16:45] of those two ladies
[16:46] going into their closet and praying so
[16:48] don't worry your prayer is never
[16:50] going to be unheard right
[16:53] never it'll never go unheard even what
[16:55] the smallest thing that you need
[16:59] so here we go right here in first
[17:00] corinthians let's read this and every
[17:02] man praying or prophesying having his
[17:03] head
[17:04] covered dishonoreth his head but every
[17:06] woman that prayeth or prophesies with
[17:07] her head uncovered dishonor with her
[17:09] head
[17:10] for that is even all even all one as
[17:13] if she were shaven that's where brother
[17:15] brown got
[17:16] the quote right there
[17:19] she dishonoreth her head
[17:22] first corinthians 11 13 judge in
[17:25] yourselves is it commonly that a woman
[17:26] pray unto god uncovered
[17:30] first thessalonians 5 16 says rejoice
[17:33] evermore pray without ceasing
[17:36] you say brother wait how you do that
[17:37] listen you don't have to close your eyes
[17:40] to pray
[17:42] that's right the bible says jesus lifted
[17:44] up his eyes toward
[17:46] heaven and started talking to somebody
[17:49] amen so you don't have to and it is
[17:52] honorable to close your eyes
[17:54] when you pray it is honorable to do that
[17:56] but listen
[17:57] when you're going down the road and
[17:58] somebody comes on your heart
[18:01] don't close your eyes you just might
[18:04] have a wreck
[18:09] but you give honor to god and say god
[18:11] i'm doing this because you put it on my
[18:12] heart
[18:13] and i'm praying while i'm driving down
[18:14] the road amen
[18:16] pray without ceasing and everything give
[18:18] thanks for this is the will of god
[18:20] in christ jesus what concerning you

[18:26] creature of god is good and nothing to
[18:27] be refused if it be received with
[18:29] thanksgiving
[18:30] for it is sanctified by the word of god
[18:33] and
[18:34] prayer everybody got that james 5
[18:37] 14 listen to this any sick among you let
[18:40] him call for the elders of the church
[18:41] and let them pray over him anointing him
[18:43] with oil in the name of the lord
[18:45] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[18:47] sick and the lord shall raise him up
[18:49] and if he had committed sins they shall
[18:52] be forgiven him
[18:54] confess your faults one to another and
[18:56] pray one for another that you may be
[18:57] healed
[18:58] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[19:01] righteous man
[19:02] availeth much
[19:06] now listen to this in revelations i'll
[19:07] get a couple quotes here and then we'll
[19:09] be done
[19:10] revelations five verse eight watch what
[19:12] it says here and when he had taken the
[19:14] book
[19:15] and the four beasts and four and twenty
[19:16] elders fell down before the lamb
[19:18] having ever one of them harps and golden
[19:20] vials watch
[19:21] full of odors in other words your prayer
[19:24] is never done away with
[19:27] it's banked up somewhere
[19:31] i'm reading the bible golden vowels full
[19:35] of odors which
[19:36] are the prayers of the saints
[19:40] every prayer you pray continues on and
[19:42] continues on
[19:43] and continues on everybody got that amen
[19:48] revelations 5 verse 8 man when he took
[19:50] the book what he took the book in
[19:51] revelation 5
[19:54] and the golden vial was full of odors
[19:56] then there was something there
[19:59] that there was a prayer of a saint that
[20:01] got you in this building there was a
[20:02] prayer of a saint that got you saved
[20:04] now they didn't save you but that
[20:07] effectual
[20:08] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[20:11] availeth much let's look at this brother
[20:14] brown let's read these
[20:15] few quotes and then then we'll close
[20:17] right here
[20:18] brother braham said oh father i pray as
[20:22] your servant the only
[20:23] we realize that prayer changes things
[20:26] prayer changes a sinner to a christian
[20:28] prayer changes a sick man into a well
[20:30] man and i ask in joining prayer with
[20:33] this man that you heal his body
[20:35] may he go off this platform happy
[20:37] rejoicing in jesus name be well
[20:40] amen number 50 the next one
[20:44] 1953 now look what prayer does prayer
[20:47] changed from death to life and god said
[20:49] the man is going to die
[20:50] i believe isaiah told the truth he was
[20:52] born a prophet his words were true and
[20:54] came from god
[20:55] then hezekiah prayer changed the opinion
[20:57] of god now i want to stop right here now
[20:59] listen
[21:00] hold on a minute this same prophet
[21:03] preached a message
[21:04] does god change his mind about his word
[21:06] he does not
[21:07] god cannot change his mind
[21:11] he knew this was going to happen before
[21:13] knowledge
[21:14] therefore he didn't change his mind but
[21:17] there had to be something to teach us a
[21:18] lesson that prayer does change you from
[21:20] a sinner to a saint
[21:22] it does change you from an unhealed
[21:24] person to a healed person
[21:25] somebody that you praying for over here
[21:27] that needs prayer
[21:28] it does change things but it never
[21:30] changes
[21:32] the eternal mind of god you can't change
[21:34] eternity
[21:36] amen nobody got that all right so now
[21:39] let's read it
[21:41] oh i like that prayer changes things
[21:44] it's the most powerful force that god
[21:47] ever put in the hands of man is a
[21:50] sincere prayer offered to god
[21:53] jesus said whatever you ask the father
[21:55] in my name that i'll do
[21:56] believe it try it once and see if it
[21:59] isn't true
[22:00] 1961 expectation what man calls great
[22:03] god calls foolish
[22:05] what man calls foolish god calls great
[22:07] so what we've got to do is get back into
[22:09] the program of god and find out after
[22:11] all
[22:12] what god wants us to do and the only way
[22:15] i know is to do it is prayer
[22:17] prayer is the key that's the answer
[22:19] prayer changes things prayer is the most
[22:21] powerful weapon
[22:22] that was ever put in the control of
[22:24] human beings there's no atomic bomb no
[22:27] hydrogen bomb as powerful
[22:29] as prayer magicians get ready to come
[22:31] prayer will change the mind of god now
[22:33] watch be careful now
[22:35] it did as we see it here but it never
[22:37] changed the mind of god he knew what was
[22:39] going to happen
[22:40] okay they'll be okay with that
[22:43] because you can't make you can't make
[22:45] god change his mind and he can't change
[22:47] his mind
[22:48] because listen as we're talking about
[22:49] the eternal plan of redemption anything
[22:51] eternal
[22:51] cannot be changed you can't eat you
[22:54] can't change the eternal plan of god
[22:56] listen try to go out there like brother
[22:58] brown said go out there
[23:00] tonight and pray until dawn this morning
[23:02] that the sun won't come up
[23:04] but god told us the sun was going to
[23:05] come up in the bible
[23:07] but now he did make provision one day
[23:10] that a man
[23:11] without the holy ghost joshua said god i
[23:14] need a few more
[23:15] hours and he had the son stand still
[23:19] he didn't do away with it he said he
[23:21] just stood still for the
[23:22] 20-something hours so he could finish
[23:24] his battle so
[23:25] god didn't change his mind he knew
[23:27] joshua was going to ask for that right
[23:29] so by foreign knowledge god can't change
[23:30] his mind
[23:32] all right but he did change the mind as
[23:34] we see it
[23:36] because he seen you hezekiah was going
[23:38] to pray but now remember when hezekiah
[23:40] prayed for 15 more years look what he
[23:41] turned out to be
[23:43] he should have went on when god took him
[23:44] said he was going to die the first time
[23:46] because you go into the perfect will of
[23:48] god to the permissive will of god
[23:50] you're walking on dangerous territory
[23:52] perfect will of god is the perfect will
[23:54] of god
[23:55] permissive will of god you can
[23:58] go wrong just like hezekiah did let's
[24:00] read this one last quote
[24:02] prayer isn't a ritual that depends on
[24:04] closing our eyes and putting on holy
[24:06] faces
[24:07] the very last one i want everybody to
[24:08] read just pull it up musicians come on
[24:10] prayer isn't a ritual that depends on
[24:12] closing your eyes and putting on holy
[24:14] faces
[24:15] we don't have to kneel or sit we can
[24:17] pray while walking driving or working
[24:20] god responds to a two-word cry for help
[24:22] in the middle of a busy afternoon
[24:24] just like he does to a focused prayer
[24:26] time after reading scripture in the
[24:28] morning
[24:29] prayer doesn't have to be complicated
[24:31] god delights in any simple word we offer
[24:34] him
[24:35] like i said before the
[24:39] you're not going to pray the sun to go
[24:40] down
[24:42] or say it the way you want it because
[24:44] god's already set it in motion
[24:46] hey man so let's stand to our feet and
[24:48] we'll brother joe come
[24:50] or we're going to play a few moments of
[24:53] of music
[24:54] just to rest for me and you can sit back
[24:56] down if you want to somebody already
[24:57] falling asleep
[24:58] i'm gonna have a hard time this
[24:59] afternoon
[25:01] y'all need to sleep at night
