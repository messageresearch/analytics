[1:15] the body of christ and we just say to
[1:17] you welcome and glad to see you in fact
[1:20] good to see you brother uh direct there

[1:37] uh wade's over preaching for brother
[1:40] pageant today
[1:41] and then
[1:42] this afternoon brother bob will be

[1:53] wednesday
[1:55] now will be brother uh daniel uh
[1:59] martinez will be ministering the word of
[2:01] the lord unto us uh for the wednesday
[2:04] night service so uh let's see wouldn't
[2:08] i'd write myself a note because i'm 81
[2:10] you know i have to i've got [snorts] an
[2:12] excuse
[2:13] me and reagan we can do anything we want
[2:15] to you know because we got excuses you
[2:17] know but uh you know it's good to see
[2:20] everybody if you'd like to just follow
[2:22] along the reading revelations 20 and
[2:24] then we'll go to romans 14
[2:26] and try to pick up a thought and just
[2:27] continue from where we were uh this past
[2:30] sunday pray the lord would bless any
[2:32] other
[2:33] things any announcements we always miss
[2:36] them
[2:38] there will be
[2:39] you've terrance's announced these others
[2:42] but we're going to have and we're going
[2:43] to just casually announce it and you
[2:47] know but we want to start announcing you
[2:50] know pretty quick pretty heavy on the
[2:52] basis of having our 50th
[2:54] anniversary of the church because this
[2:57] coming fourth of july will be 50 years
[3:00] that we have been in service in this
[3:02] church
[3:03] and i pray and hope that it doesn't end
[3:06] up the way that it did we're going to
[3:07] have the services at another place
[3:10] because if you remember what happened
[3:12] here when we had the first service
[3:15] 50 years ago
[3:17] there was five vehicles parked out front
[3:20] and a man came down the road uh running
[3:23] real fast and he he just took a little
[3:25] part of each one and kind of demolished
[3:28] a couple of them and all so we pray and
[3:30] hope that that won't be so we're going
[3:31] to have it somewhere else not for that
[3:34] reason but it'll be and it'll be
[3:36] announced later and on where uh you
[3:38] would understand okay
[3:40] father we thank you for this day in your
[3:42] grace we thank you for everything and we
[3:45] pray that you would just guide each one
[3:46] of us in your love let your light shine
[3:49] into our hearts and lives that we may
[3:50] see you
[3:52] and to walk in the light of your grace
[3:54] father just be with each one member way
[3:56] there as he's ministering for brother
[3:57] pageant and lord and just bless each one
[4:00] and just let your light come forth and
[4:02] show us lord the things to say to your
[4:05] people we love you and we thank you we
[4:08] just praise your great name in the name
[4:11] of the lord jesus christ is what we pray
[4:13] amen
[4:17] if you
[4:19] like to follow in the reading of
[4:21] revelations
[4:23] 20.
[4:24] we'll start verse 7.
[4:26] now the reason i'm reading this i want
[4:28] you to realize
[4:30] when this will take place
[4:33] the time frames is what i'm wanting you
[4:36] to get
[4:37] because the time frames will help us
[4:40] to understand what is taking place
[4:44] see all right see you say well this year
[4:46] take place here well that might have
[4:47] taken place over in the old testament
[4:50] there's a time frame for different
[4:52] things
[4:53] and that's what i want you to to follow
[4:55] is the time frame and then you'll know
[4:58] and you won't be wondering well when
[4:59] does this happen
[5:01] because you'll have the lineup that says
[5:03] well somebody said it's over here so but
[5:05] it can't be there
[5:07] because there's a time frame laid there
[5:09] that shows it to what it will be so
[5:11] listen to the time frame now and when
[5:14] the thousand years are expired okay now
[5:17] this is after the millennium
[5:20] this is coming forth a thousand years of
[5:22] millennial reign all right
[5:25] satan shall be loose
[5:27] out of his prison
[5:29] he should go out to deceive the nations
[5:32] which are in the four quarters of the
[5:34] earth gog and magog
[5:36] to gather them together to battle
[5:38] the number of whom is as the sand of the
[5:41] sea
[5:42] and they went up on the breath of the
[5:43] earth
[5:44] and compassed the camp of the saints
[5:47] about
[5:48] the blood and the beloved city and fire
[5:50] came down from god out of heaven and
[5:53] devoured them
[5:55] and the devil that deceived
[5:57] them was cast into the lake of fire
[6:00] and brimstone
[6:01] or in brims and where the beast and the
[6:03] false prophet are
[6:05] and shall be tormented day and night
[6:08] forever and ever
[6:10] and i saw a white throne a great white
[6:12] throne
[6:13] and him that sat on the throne
[6:16] whose face the earth
[6:19] and this heaven fled away
[6:21] and there was found no place for them
[6:24] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[6:27] before god
[6:28] and the books
[6:30] books now plural so you have the book of
[6:33] life will be present at this judgment
[6:36] but you also have books
[6:38] which books is actually the books of the
[6:40] sinners which is a record of life in in
[6:43] mankind there will be books there that
[6:45] will be a record of what where what is
[6:47] doing of the people upon the earth all
[6:50] right and books were opened and another
[6:52] book was open which is the book of life
[6:55] and the dead were judged out of those
[6:58] things which were written
[7:00] in the books according to their works
[7:03] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[7:06] in it and death and
[7:07] hell delivered up the dead which were
[7:10] were in them and they were judged every
[7:13] man according to their works
[7:15] and death and hell was cast into the
[7:17] lake of fire
[7:18] this is the second death
[7:20] and whosoever was not found written
[7:23] in the book of life
[7:25] was cast into
[7:27] the lake of fire you may be seated the
[7:29] lord at his blessing to the reading of
[7:31] the word we'll pick up our scripture
[7:33] as we were using it last
[7:36] week
[7:37] and
[7:39] so you understand what i'm what i'm
[7:40] doing
[7:42] in other words that way to me i can
[7:44] understand the bible
[7:46] if i can find a time frame a position a
[7:49] situation
[7:50] and i know then that way i know that i'm
[7:54] lined up in the scriptures
[7:56] and see then we read where when the
[7:58] thousand years has expired so this is
[8:00] after the thousand year so we know the
[8:02] thousand years and the millennial reign
[8:05] which is born again believers we believe
[8:07] in the millennial reign
[8:09] that is to come one day of a thousand
[8:11] years upon earth to to to god to rule
[8:14] and reign upon this earth and we are to
[8:16] be there with him
[8:18] in that ruling and reigning in in times
[8:21] and even the bible speaks that that
[8:23] we're to join the fact that even that we
[8:25] will be able to one day judge angels
[8:29] the bible speaks of the people of god or
[8:31] someone that will judge angels or even
[8:33] judge the people and things like that
[8:36] and there is those judgments set there
[8:39] all right but now this judgment here is
[8:42] the same judgment of daniel 9
[8:44] daniel 7 9 through 10
[8:47] which brings up and and
[8:49] shows the
[8:50] judgment or the white throne judgment as
[8:53] we are to basically
[8:55] use it in our terminology in
[8:57] christianity that there is coming a time
[9:00] when there will be a
[9:02] white throne judgment there will be a
[9:03] judgment
[9:05] set for mankind
[9:07] and and that judgment will be there for
[9:09] for uh to determine
[9:12] and at the white throne judgment it will
[9:14] be the determining of whether or not
[9:17] you can enter into eternal life
[9:21] because see the book is there
[9:23] which is a lamb's book of life or the
[9:25] book of life is just called here all
[9:27] right that book will be there and if
[9:29] your name is not written as we read in
[9:32] that book
[9:33] then you're going to be cast out
[9:36] all right so there's going to be a book
[9:39] there there's going to be books
[9:41] which is the books of the sinners or in
[9:43] other words the life of mankind
[9:46] books records not necessarily having to
[9:49] have uh you know i hope you understand
[9:51] my point it's not necessarily that there
[9:53] has to be these books are and they turn
[9:55] to play okay we see here so and so once
[9:57] and we turn another place on uh remember
[9:59] we're in a computer age
[10:02] when you can go in a thousand people
[10:04] could appear across a screen as to be
[10:07] judged and different things like that
[10:09] but just to think about uh the things
[10:12] that will take place all right but what
[10:14] we were talking about last sunday
[10:18] and getting to that point that we see
[10:20] this
[10:21] this white throne judgment
[10:25] all right and that white throne judgment
[10:28] as we've read here and shown in it it
[10:30] will be determining whether or not some
[10:33] people will be given eternal life
[10:36] because there is an opportunity after
[10:38] this world of receiving eternal life but
[10:40] it's not in the basis of
[10:42] not throwing off on anybody not in the
[10:44] basis of catholicism of how good you are
[10:47] for this or that or the other or what
[10:49] you've done or didn't do that way it's a
[10:51] judgment
[10:53] that will be set one day because there
[10:55] will be
[10:56] a white throne and god will sit on that
[10:59] throne according to the book of daniel
[11:01] and there'll be people sitting on that
[11:02] throne with him
[11:04] all right now that's what's so marvelous
[11:07] is to find out that those people sitting
[11:09] on that throne with him are special
[11:11] people that are not having to be judged
[11:14] at a white throne
[11:18] because their judgment is already set
[11:20] here
[11:21] if you receive eternal life here you do
[11:23] not have to go to the white throne
[11:25] judgment
[11:26] that is a marvelous situation or a point
[11:29] of interest and should be to each one of
[11:32] us a joy to think about it that hey if
[11:35] we get born again saved born again
[11:37] whatever you calling it uh your new
[11:39] birth your your things whatever you're
[11:42] calling your salvation when we get to
[11:44] that to where that you receive that
[11:46] eternal life here
[11:50] you don't have to go
[11:52] to a white throne
[11:55] you will actually be sitting on the
[11:57] throne
[11:58] with him
[12:00] to judge others even to judge angels the
[12:02] bible says
[12:04] see because there's going to have to be
[12:05] a judgment set of those things but what
[12:08] about a group of people that will be
[12:10] able to uh we bypass death we bypass all
[12:13] of the things and sit on the white
[12:15] throne or sit on the throne with him not
[12:18] standing before him
[12:20] there's thousands
[12:22] thousands standing before him as we
[12:24] caught we read there and read the book
[12:26] of daniel and all and you'll see a great
[12:29] uh multitude of people because all the
[12:31] dead will have to be raised up
[12:34] see
[12:34] and brought to that white throne
[12:36] judgment and when it does then thousands
[12:39] of thousands will stand before him to be
[12:43] judged but also thousands of thousands
[12:46] that said will sit on the throne with
[12:47] him
[12:48] and that is what we call the bride
[12:52] all right what we call the bride of
[12:54] christ you can determine it as a the
[12:56] wife of daniel of a revelation where it
[12:59] says in the in the the wife hath made
[13:01] herself ready you can use the word wife
[13:03] you can use the word
[13:05] bride because it is the born-again
[13:07] believer is what you're talking about
[13:10] all right and see if we receive eternal
[13:12] life here we don't have to go through a
[13:13] threat to a judgment there's nothing to
[13:15] be judged for
[13:19] i i kind of like the way the prophet
[13:21] said it one day like this uh you you
[13:23] married your wife
[13:25] but before you marry your wife you're
[13:27] gonna put her through a test
[13:29] to see whether she's worthy for you you
[13:31] know for you to marry her or not now
[13:32] then wouldn't that be something
[13:34] there'd probably be very few weddings
[13:37] uh because it would just the women would
[13:39] back out you know and i wouldn't blame
[13:41] them
[13:41] because if if
[13:43] if i i don't look at my wife to see what
[13:46] she was
[13:47] i look at her to see what she is
[13:51] she is a christian all right being a
[13:53] christian
[13:54] then we put it to the basis of whether
[13:56] or not not whether she was but worthy to
[13:59] be my wife
[14:00] it was the choice i had of making that
[14:02] to where that i could accept her as my
[14:05] wife
[14:07] and see that's what he's done for you
[14:08] and i
[14:09] you just think about it one day that
[14:12] that you'll be able to just walk through
[14:13] those gates and just everything's open
[14:15] and and you can go into the future home
[14:18] that comes present right after this but
[14:21] that's my point of britain see
[14:23] millennium
[14:25] in other words here we are right now
[14:26] give your fights run through here we are
[14:28] right now
[14:29] we're in the time of the last days the
[14:31] ending up of all things the next thing
[14:34] is the message going to israel
[14:37] all right and it will be then a
[14:39] millennial reign of a thousand years
[14:41] upon the earth
[14:43] to really to prove that the sin curse is
[14:46] gone from from the earth that's that's
[14:48] what i like the reason for having a
[14:50] millennial reign is to show that
[14:53] all sin is gone in that point of view
[14:57] and you and i can
[14:58] we can rule and reign for a thousand
[15:00] years then there will be a white throne
[15:02] judgment but not for us to stand
[15:05] but it'll be for the world or the sinner
[15:07] or the person of the world you know that
[15:09] will be there and if they've been good
[15:11] to you maybe they could give each other
[15:14] get a little bit because that's what
[15:15] jesus was speaking of in in his doings
[15:18] you know of of
[15:19] giving us a place of showing what it is
[15:22] so important to be the born-again
[15:24] believer or the bride of jesus christ
[15:27] we don't have to go to those places
[15:30] we don't have to have that we don't have
[15:32] to be judged we're already judged we
[15:34] judge the point
[15:36] by accepting jesus christ and it's not
[15:39] whether or not we're worthy
[15:42] that's not the judgments of the
[15:44] convention it's whether or not he's
[15:46] worthy
[15:48] we say well i know he's worthy well all
[15:50] right then if i know he's worthy then he
[15:52] hath made me worthy
[15:54] it's not what i am
[15:56] it's what he's made me
[15:58] he gave me the opportunity to become his
[16:00] bride
[16:03] and see then that way we will be into
[16:05] that basis of of
[16:07] ruling and writing with him
[16:09] all right now
[16:11] but there's also in the bible
[16:14] another town spoken of
[16:16] that we tried to cover you know into
[16:18] doing it so go ahead brothers and pull
[16:20] that one up
[16:21] into romans
[16:25] so we read that to start with but we
[16:26] want to we want to read it again
[16:31] but look what it says now
[16:33] but why dost thou judge thy brother
[16:38] or why doest thou
[16:39] said it not thy brother
[16:42] for we shall all stand
[16:44] before the judgment
[16:46] seat of christ
[16:50] all right
[16:52] now
[16:53] all is going to stand before the
[16:55] judgment seat of christ
[16:58] but i just spent 15 minutes explaining
[17:01] according to the bible and what we are
[17:03] to be that we do not have to sit on any
[17:06] we don't have to stand before the whites
[17:08] on judgment
[17:10] so there must be something
[17:12] in our understanding that we need to
[17:14] know that there there is a white throne
[17:16] judgment yes
[17:18] and that's where the sinner goes and
[17:19] that's where those things happen
[17:22] but we'll be sitting on the throne with
[17:24] him judging the others
[17:26] and then now we're talking about another
[17:28] judgment that is in the bible
[17:33] and this is the judgment seat of christ
[17:36] not the white throne judgment
[17:40] it's the judgment seat of christ
[17:42] all right and look what it says
[17:47] for we shall all stand before the
[17:48] judgment seat of christ for it is
[17:50] written as i live saith the lord
[17:52] every knee shall bow to me and every
[17:54] tongue shall confess to god
[17:57] so then every one of us shall give an
[18:00] account
[18:01] of himself to god
[18:05] let us not therefore judge one another
[18:07] anymore
[18:10] well now look what we're supposed to do
[18:11] but judge this rather that no man put a
[18:14] stumbling block
[18:16] or an occasion to fall in his brother's
[18:19] way in other words we don't want to harm
[18:22] or to hurt or to destroy or whatever the
[18:25] brother or sister
[18:27] that would be called to the bible of a
[18:28] weak faith or whatever is doing it we
[18:32] don't want to do that but but do you see
[18:34] what i'm talking about now
[18:37] you have a great white throne judgment
[18:39] don't miss that
[18:42] because by being born again you do miss
[18:44] that
[18:45] you miss the point of having to satire
[18:49] stand there to be judged
[18:51] all right
[18:52] but see then you come to this that
[18:55] there's a judgment
[18:57] here of the deeds as we'll read in a
[19:00] little bit
[19:01] done in the body whether good or bad
[19:04] and we're going to be judged accordingly
[19:09] now remember my point and i've tried to
[19:11] emphasize about this
[19:14] if it's a judgment seat of christ
[19:17] it will be a judgment of rewards or
[19:21] losing rewards
[19:26] that's what we got to deal with
[19:29] you say losing what no no not losing
[19:31] eternal life now i know no don't don't
[19:34] get no idea in your mind like that no no
[19:37] no point
[19:38] you can't lose eternal life
[19:41] god's not an ending giver he's not going
[19:43] to give it to you and take it away
[19:46] if he gives you eternal life you have
[19:48] eternal life
[19:50] you don't have to worry about that point
[19:51] you're not going to be judged whether or
[19:53] not to receive eternal life because
[19:54] you're not going to sit before the white
[19:55] throne
[19:56] you're going to sit on the throne with
[19:58] him right now all right
[20:00] so then when coming to it then what is
[20:03] this judgment seat of christ
[20:07] what is this position that we have there
[20:11] but it says we shall all stand
[20:13] before that judgment
[20:16] all right
[20:18] we read that one in romans so go ahead
[20:20] and pick up number three
[20:22] which is taken from second corinthians
[20:26] and we'll read that one
[20:34] okay
[20:35] ii corinthians 5 10
[20:37] for we must all appear
[20:40] before the judgment seat of christ
[20:44] now i mean that's i just read to you
[20:47] where it comes from romans
[20:49] now hears you two times so in the mouth
[20:50] of two or three witnesses let everything
[20:52] be established right
[20:54] all right
[20:55] so now what are we doing
[20:58] where we must all appear before the
[21:00] judgment seat of christ that everyone
[21:03] may receive the things done in his body
[21:07] now keep that in mind
[21:09] according to that he hath done
[21:12] whether it be good or bad
[21:15] right now
[21:18] we've taken out of the picture totally
[21:21] of the white throne judgment
[21:23] because that cannot be there to a
[21:25] christian
[21:26] that is annihilated out of the situation
[21:28] and not even to be thought of
[21:30] then you can't say well i read over here
[21:32] where this happened i read over here
[21:33] where this out all right read all you
[21:35] want to you're just reading yourself out
[21:36] of the will of god because he will that
[21:39] we would have eternal life what is the
[21:41] faith it's
[21:42] eternal life living in us by the new
[21:45] birth
[21:47] all right see then by doing that then we
[21:49] come to a place
[21:51] that there'll be a situation
[21:53] of a judgment seat
[21:55] but all right now let's settle this
[21:57] point
[21:58] i like to do that i like to say this if
[22:01] a means a then a don't mean b
[22:05] right if a means a then a is a
[22:10] and you leave it alone all right so it's
[22:12] so subtle it's out of the picture of the
[22:15] white throne judgment
[22:18] it's placed and and and
[22:20] put forth that there's no argument about
[22:22] it okay
[22:23] now yeah but i think i don't care what
[22:25] you think because you don't care what i
[22:28] think
[22:30] there's nothing in this basis of what we
[22:32] think
[22:33] it's in the basis of what god said
[22:37] all right see then we leave it that way
[22:39] let it be what he says about it okay but
[22:41] he says here twice we've read it in
[22:43] romans and corinthians that there will
[22:45] be a judgment seat of christ
[22:49] and you'll be judged
[22:52] but now get the point now this is not
[22:55] the white throne so it has nothing to do
[22:56] with eternal life
[22:58] it is not a situation of deciding
[23:00] whether you're going to heaven or not
[23:02] that is dealt with in romans and
[23:04] corinthians
[23:05] because this is true the bride of jesus
[23:07] christ
[23:10] right
[23:11] now that's what i like about the way the
[23:13] bible is written it'll say to the saints
[23:20] see
[23:22] all right when you're reading these
[23:23] things then you read it there and in
[23:25] each one of these beginning chapters
[23:27] read the galatians and romans and then
[23:29] it'll say to the saints
[23:33] well who are the saints
[23:35] we're not catholicism we're not dealing
[23:37] with unlike who are the saints the
[23:39] born-again believer
[23:42] to those that are in christ jesus
[23:47] so then to what you're writing then who
[23:49] is it written to
[23:51] now in revelations it's written to the
[23:53] whole world
[23:55] coming up from the book of daniel
[23:57] anybody can read it because it is not a
[23:59] situational pointing of
[24:03] as much of the people as it is what's
[24:05] taking place
[24:07] but when you come into the new testament
[24:09] and it'll say to the saints
[24:12] that are in ephesus
[24:15] that's right well that's born again
[24:17] believers the bible is not written now
[24:19] listen the bible is not written to the
[24:22] sinner
[24:25] the only thing the bible can do to a
[24:27] sinner is make the sinner realize
[24:29] they're a sinner
[24:33] it can't save the sinner it can't do
[24:35] anything for him because he has to
[24:37] accept that to be in his place and then
[24:40] let god come on the scene and work out
[24:42] the salvation of his own
[24:45] but it is
[24:46] it's not the basis that we we try to put
[24:49] this that are there no we we put the
[24:51] word of god
[24:53] whatever the word says all right so then
[24:56] in this
[24:58] why would they be a judgment seat
[25:05] why would they be a judgment seat of
[25:07] christ
[25:12] but we know for sure it is not dealing
[25:14] with eternal life so i'll annihilate
[25:16] that that's what i like to do take that
[25:18] out of the way
[25:19] you know you go argue all you want to
[25:21] what you think about that when the bible
[25:24] takes it out of the way you put it out
[25:25] away
[25:27] all right
[25:28] see then it's not what you say or i say
[25:31] it's what he says
[25:33] all right
[25:35] no [clears throat] then that's not our
[25:36] ideas and our thoughts okay
[25:38] now so we see that there is
[25:41] two judgments evidently in the bible
[25:46] because of the situation as i'm saying
[25:49] the time frame
[25:51] there is no time frame connecting to the
[25:54] judgment seat of christ except for one
[25:56] thing if it would be the judgment seat
[25:58] of christ it would have to be after
[25:59] christ came
[26:01] do you agree
[26:03] it would be after christ came
[26:05] that there would be a time set that they
[26:08] would be a
[26:09] judgment
[26:11] seat of christ
[26:14] but the book of revelations can vary
[26:16] back to the old testament through to the
[26:18] new testament pick up all of the people
[26:20] of the world bring them all into a
[26:22] judgment
[26:26] but yet to the bride there's no way no
[26:28] judgment one because when you accept
[26:30] jesus christ as your savior he died in
[26:32] your place he's not looking no more what
[26:34] me and you
[26:35] do or anything it's what he's done
[26:39] all right
[26:41] see then being that there's evidently
[26:43] two judgments
[26:46] okay
[26:48] one we know for a surety the white
[26:50] throne
[26:51] we know what takes place
[26:54] but we know also then that it's speaking
[26:56] of a judgment seat of christ we've
[26:59] received the time frame elements of
[27:01] thinking about it in the basis that the
[27:03] white throne will cover the whole world
[27:08] time frame you know all world
[27:10] but the judgment seat of christ will not
[27:12] be judging judging that away because
[27:15] it's not a determining of whether or not
[27:17] you're going to heaven or not
[27:21] it's a judgment of the deeds done in the
[27:23] body
[27:26] because paul used the word you know
[27:28] i want to go to body
[27:31] see it's what we do in the body
[27:34] that we're going to have to give an
[27:35] account for
[27:37] but i i see now here's where we throw
[27:39] that line in there but i throw back with
[27:42] you with one thing
[27:43] see we say but now brother dale if i'm a
[27:45] born-again believer you've got just just
[27:48] got through telling me that i'm saved
[27:50] that i can never be lost i agree with
[27:53] all of that
[27:55] i agree wholeheartedly with every bit of
[27:57] it
[27:58] but i agree one thing that that i've
[28:00] been all of my life i don't believe in
[28:02] living like the devil and claiming to be
[28:04] a christian
[28:07] i believe if you live like the devil you
[28:09] are the devil
[28:11] that's the best way of me saying it i
[28:13] don't i just don't play no games with
[28:15] nobody or nothing uh you know if you
[28:18] live like the devil it's just the devil
[28:21] all right but now we are not blame the
[28:23] devil for everything
[28:26] come on i've been preaching to you 50
[28:27] years almost you know how many times
[28:29] i've said that let's don't blame the
[28:31] devil for everything
[28:32] well the devil made me do it no no no
[28:36] it's my brother he's a methodist
[28:38] minister he said well the devil devil
[28:40] made me do it and said god can't judge
[28:42] me for being evil i said he didn't make
[28:45] you evil
[28:46] you made yourself evil
[28:50] it is not what he made you
[28:52] i said you better be dealing with
[28:53] eternal life all right now
[28:55] so
[28:56] then what is it
[28:58] where would this judgment seat of christ
[29:00] be
[29:02] all right if it's a judgment seat of
[29:03] christ it would be in the time of christ
[29:05] that should be sensible that should be
[29:09] beyond any reproach of thought
[29:12] that it is in a time frame element of
[29:16] the days of eternal life
[29:18] which is now the old testament was not
[29:20] the days of eternal life because eternal
[29:22] life was not back there for them because
[29:24] jesus christ had not died the holy ghost
[29:26] the bible said it had not been given
[29:27] because christ had not been crucified
[29:30] all right so there was no eternal life
[29:32] back there in the old testament in that
[29:34] basis of eternal life like it is today
[29:37] see that ended at calvary in the
[29:40] judgments and things and that's why
[29:41] there has to be a white throne judgment
[29:44] to take care of all of those people
[29:46] that are there there's plenty of jews
[29:48] there's plenty of different groups
[29:49] there's plenty of foolish virgins as we
[29:51] call them there there's different uh
[29:54] sections of people that will have to be
[29:56] judged one of these days
[29:58] but we're beyond that we're in the days
[30:00] of grace
[30:02] all right and being in the days of grace
[30:05] then we know that we we're not to be in
[30:08] the days of disgrace
[30:13] then we're to be into the basis of where
[30:16] the bible says that there'll be a
[30:18] judgment
[30:20] seat of christ
[30:24] now
[30:25] i keep saying it over and over because i
[30:26] don't wan see i know this way you you
[30:29] say something one time people get they
[30:31] can remember that about two minutes
[30:33] you say it two times they might remember
[30:34] at five if you say it five times they'll
[30:37] finally get to where at least they'll
[30:38] remember it just a little bit then you
[30:40] know how i generally do it i try to put
[30:41] a little something in there comical to
[30:43] go along with that point because the
[30:46] comical point will make you remember
[30:47] what i've been talking about
[30:49] okay
[30:51] that's the way that that i try to get
[30:53] your cons to get your attention
[30:58] and to get it to where that i can say
[30:59] look this is it
[31:02] it can't be this because of this
[31:06] it can't be the white throne judgment we
[31:08] can't stand there
[31:10] what do you got to be judged about
[31:13] but yet when it comes to the judgment
[31:14] seat of christ then there is something
[31:16] about that but remember it's not a
[31:19] judgment
[31:20] as much as it is a
[31:23] reward or a lack of rewards it's my way
[31:26] of saying it that's my point of looking
[31:28] at it because i can't see in other words
[31:30] you don't you don't want to take a
[31:32] person that's borne again
[31:34] that's free from all sin and then try to
[31:36] make them a sinner
[31:39] no no no no you don't do that
[31:42] you leave us to what we are but you do
[31:44] realize one thing for sure we're still
[31:46] human beings
[31:48] that's why i spent so lengthy of time
[31:50] there with it and i rewrote a lot of it
[31:52] to to reuse it today but we're in
[31:54] galatians 5 you know that it speaks of
[31:57] the works of the flesh
[32:01] but then it speaks of the fruits through
[32:03] the spirit
[32:06] the works of the flesh is adultery and
[32:08] sin you know like seriousness all kind
[32:10] of things that are taking place
[32:13] that's works of the flesh
[32:15] that's what this flesh does
[32:17] in the word it inhabits a world of a
[32:20] sinful thing
[32:21] but then fruits of the spirit is love
[32:23] joy peace goodness meekness and desire
[32:25] all like that what is that that's from
[32:27] the inside out coming outward to be
[32:30] lived out into the flesh of mankind what
[32:33] is within us
[32:35] all right
[32:36] and see then it's do it because i'm
[32:38] trying to get you to look at a point
[32:40] that you'd [clears throat] say well what
[32:41] kind of a judgment would that judgment
[32:43] be it's not going to be a judgment now
[32:46] i'm serious i try to be as
[32:49] best as i can with you and i hope you
[32:50] listen to me
[32:51] uh
[32:53] i don't believe there's going to be a
[32:55] time set aside i'm just serious i don't
[32:57] believe there's going to be a set of
[32:58] time times and
[33:00] and you know
[33:02] zach
[33:04] he's got to be judged
[33:06] you know you've been a good boy
[33:09] well yeah i thought i was well
[33:11] you know
[33:13] it's all right but if you had done
[33:15] anything wrong
[33:19] you said no no no you're getting silly
[33:21] because no i'm not silly i'm getting to
[33:23] the point
[33:27] see what is sin
[33:32] okay
[33:34] sin is not
[33:36] drinking gambling smoking running around
[33:38] with women
[33:39] right that's not sin
[33:43] wait a minute now
[33:45] you're a funny preacher
[33:48] no i try to get your point
[33:52] sin is unbelief he that believeth not is
[33:54] condemned already
[33:56] sin is unbelief it is not the things
[33:59] that you're doing
[34:01] that's the works of the flesh
[34:06] that's the things that this flesh gets
[34:07] caught up into and according to paul
[34:09] during galatians he's emphatically
[34:12] stating and remember that is to the
[34:14] church
[34:15] that he's trying to tell the church that
[34:17] she's got problems
[34:20] she's got works
[34:22] of the flesh
[34:25] she's got things there that don't be
[34:27] it's not needed
[34:30] but then he turns around in the same
[34:32] thing and shows how good it is because
[34:34] he deals with the fruits of the spirit
[34:36] right in the same chapter
[34:39] the fruits of the spirit is love joy
[34:41] peace goodness all right
[34:46] now getting the point of where we're
[34:47] living in the hour that we're living
[34:52] all right
[34:54] not of standing before judgment and and
[34:57] me standing before donnie and he
[34:59] standing looks at me and said yeah yeah
[35:01] you've done that
[35:03] i don't you don't have to tell me i've
[35:05] done that
[35:06] because when i get to there
[35:09] there ain't going to be nothing head
[35:11] right it ain't going to be him bringing
[35:13] up something that i tried to hide
[35:18] right
[35:19] it's going to be everybody in the
[35:21] building knows all about each other
[35:22] that's the best way of putting it again
[35:24] right you know there ain't going to be
[35:26] no why no no no hiding this that or the
[35:30] other
[35:32] but
[35:33] but
[35:34] that's that's where you you're funny you
[35:36] say we're born again and that makes us
[35:38] pure
[35:38] that's true
[35:40] but the works of the flesh comes back
[35:42] and gets involved into it
[35:44] right
[35:46] and the things we do in our life
[35:51] the little small things
[35:53] the little foxes
[35:55] the bible says is what spoils the vine
[36:01] it's not the big old fox that turns the
[36:02] whole vine down
[36:04] it's a little old fox that nibbles at
[36:05] the roots
[36:08] and just enough to make it to the word
[36:10] ain't going to be worth nothing
[36:12] it'll die of its own
[36:16] this church
[36:20] if we're a born again christian why
[36:21] would we not want
[36:25] to stand in a position
[36:27] to be right
[36:32] well i don't want to stand before
[36:34] you're standing now [clears throat]
[36:41] because i've got one quote that relates
[36:44] an idea of where this
[36:46] judgment seat of christ comes into view
[36:50] but you know what it's here
[36:56] i thought that the bible said that
[37:01] how is it
[37:05] judgment begins
[37:07] were
[37:10] where does the bible say judgment begins
[37:14] at the house of the lord
[37:17] in other words in the pulpit
[37:21] to the janitor
[37:23] to all the pews
[37:25] and all in between
[37:28] judgment begins at the house of the lord
[37:34] now is that true then that the bible
[37:36] says some men's sins
[37:39] go before them
[37:41] i've got these written here if you need
[37:42] them so
[37:45] some men sins go before them and some
[37:48] follow after
[37:50] you know that everything i ask god to
[37:52] forgive me and i'm really sincere in the
[37:53] basis of that now i put that in there
[37:55] because that's the point
[37:57] you say i asked god but was you sincere
[38:02] like i said how do we wind up doing
[38:07] we wind up and and and i do something to
[38:09] zach you know how i did illustrate i do
[38:11] something exactly
[38:14] well i need to go make that right
[38:17] because that's my brother
[38:20] and if that's my brother that's christ
[38:22] living there
[38:24] all right
[38:25] but you know what i won't do it i just
[38:26] kind of
[38:28] after while i mull it around
[38:31] i know i'm a funny preacher but i
[38:33] this is the way i preach because it's
[38:34] the way i live
[38:36] after a while you know what i begin to
[38:40] think that he was the problem
[38:42] not me
[38:45] you know
[38:47] and you know give me a couple of weeks
[38:49] and you know what i'm telling him or
[38:51] saying he owes me an apology
[38:56] you understand
[38:58] see we let these little things slide by
[39:01] and after a while they get where they
[39:03] don't hurt too much
[39:07] right
[39:09] well i know uh i know we're driving down
[39:11] the road today and
[39:13] and that guy pushed me out and i got mad
[39:18] well where's that for a christian
[39:22] get out of the way
[39:24] the best thing
[39:26] and certainly don't chase him down
[39:31] that wouldn't even fit no christianity
[39:33] you ain't got no pages to put that in
[39:35] the book okay
[39:39] leave him alone
[39:41] wave bye to him
[39:43] say bless you brother
[39:47] he said the way it's working right now i
[39:49] can pray for you but don't try it the
[39:51] second time i might not do it because
[39:52] i'm human
[39:57] oh but i don't have no problems
[40:00] why well
[40:02] i know i told donny off this morning but
[40:04] he knows i love him
[40:12] you understand
[40:15] works of the flesh
[40:18] i ask you to read that i ask you to read
[40:20] galatians 5.
[40:23] i don't ask how many did it i ask you to
[40:25] read galatians 5.
[40:29] he said but brother dale i'm no murderer
[40:32] it says i'm murderer i'm not a murderer
[40:35] the bible says if you
[40:37] use your mouth you condem a brother
[40:40] you murdered him
[40:45] you might want to read them take the
[40:46] dictionary and look up what these words
[40:50] are
[40:53] you might find out you got a few of them
[40:56] or is that the way we want it we don't
[40:58] want to find out we've got a few of them
[41:00] oh no no i've been a good christian
[41:03] i've never had a wrong thought or
[41:05] anything like that no but you just lied
[41:10] well that solves that part
[41:13] because come on you are human
[41:16] can i quote the bible
[41:20] is it not true that in the bible that
[41:22] said that jesus got angry
[41:27] now let's correct that and get it
[41:28] straight okay it didn't say he got mad
[41:32] now go look up the word
[41:35] it didn't say jesus got mad the prophet
[41:38] didn't say jesus got mad he said jesus
[41:41] got angry
[41:43] when he cast him out of the temple
[41:48] now he didn't walk over there i wish i
[41:50] would leave
[41:51] you know you know i got this little whip
[41:53] thing here but i ain't gonna i ain't
[41:55] gonna would y'all mind just leaving the
[41:57] temple and letting us no no no no no no
[42:01] no
[42:05] not mad there's a difference in mad
[42:08] because matt is crazy
[42:10] okay
[42:11] look it up mad at the word mad is
[42:13] literally crazy
[42:17] but when you get to the point that
[42:19] you've got problems bothering you and
[42:21] you're upset that's not crazy
[42:25] that's just the point of a human being
[42:30] well i don't know i don't i don't owe
[42:33] tony no apology well he knows
[42:36] my heart
[42:37] he's been around here a long time he
[42:39] ordered on me a little bit by now that's
[42:41] the problem
[42:44] he does know
[42:46] he knows i'm human
[42:50] i've never tried to make anything to my
[42:51] grandkids or grand kids or or whatever
[42:54] gregory tried to make them think that i
[42:57] was something different than a human
[42:58] being
[43:04] i don't have to go out and just
[43:05] deliberately do things
[43:07] but they know
[43:10] but they know one thing for sure they
[43:11] know papa loves them
[43:15] we had zach here he'd tell you he's the
[43:16] only grandson that i spanked boy i wore
[43:19] him out
[43:20] he'll tell you in a hurry that i beat
[43:22] him to death you know it was it was
[43:23] child abuse
[43:25] sure was i went and get off that ladder
[43:27] and get in the house and quit fooling
[43:28] with me because i was trying to put up
[43:30] some vinyl and every time i'd go up one
[43:32] ladder he'd go up the other ladder
[43:35] when he come i'd get him off that ladder
[43:37] and i'd go up that ladder and he'd go up
[43:38] this ladder
[43:39] you know how old he was
[43:42] three or four
[43:46] somewhere in there
[43:48] but he thinks that i was a mean old guy
[43:52] but he knows i love him
[43:56] right
[43:57] he knows i love him
[44:00] my kids don't have to question and say
[44:02] daddy do you love me no isn't that
[44:03] something
[44:07] no
[44:08] your kids know a whole lot more about
[44:10] you than you think
[44:12] right
[44:14] what are you smiling about on it
[44:17] someone getting grins out of the kids
[44:18] okay
[44:20] they're true hey i don't try to be
[44:22] anything but what i am
[44:25] i've never been nothing but what i am
[44:26] pastor whatever
[44:30] you don't see me trying to build up
[44:32] anything to make it something that i'm
[44:34] what i'm something that i'm not i'm just
[44:36] a i'm a christian i'm a born-again
[44:39] christian
[44:42] you want to talk a little while
[44:45] i see that's what people don't like
[44:46] about me because they know that i'll put
[44:48] it on tape
[44:50] you want to talk about the time that
[44:52] brother branham said in the doorway
[44:54] of a motel with a pistol in his lap
[44:57] because someone had made a remark about
[45:00] his daughter
[45:05] well you don't know what it's true i've
[45:07] been told
[45:13] see brother brown was a human
[45:16] that's what caught me you know what
[45:18] caught me in the bible in the
[45:20] terminologies of it or the thoughts of
[45:21] it in the beginning
[45:24] before i ever heard the message or
[45:25] anything
[45:28] i thought about a man called abraham
[45:34] and all of the things that happened
[45:40] the good and the bad
[45:44] and giving his wife away a couple of
[45:45] times
[45:48] right
[45:48] good and bad
[45:54] what if it is that we're not going to
[45:56] be judged to where they're going to be a
[45:58] class put over here okay y'all go over
[46:01] in that group now cause y'all fit in
[46:03] that sin group
[46:05] but these over here don't fit in that
[46:06] they get an extra
[46:12] that's why i'm thinking what i'm
[46:13] thinking
[46:15] well we're here in the period of time of
[46:17] what's called the stature of a perfect
[46:19] man
[46:21] faith virtue knowledge temple space of
[46:22] god
[46:23] our thought in the a and in the day and
[46:26] the time that we're talking about the
[46:27] adoptions that's mentioned in the bible
[46:30] and brought through of how that paul
[46:32] covers that how that a child is no
[46:34] different
[46:39] but he's untrue under tutors and
[46:41] governors until a time appointed
[46:46] could that be
[46:47] this is where we're at now
[46:49] [clears throat]
[46:50] could it be that we're in a situation
[46:52] now existence of the basis of whether or
[46:54] not we're not made it's not being made
[46:57] in here today of deciding of to going to
[47:00] heaven or not
[47:03] but it's our life
[47:09] living not christ
[47:15] who never got mad
[47:21] and we call it righteous indignation but
[47:23] that don't work too much in that
[47:29] he drove him out of the temple
[47:32] oh i heard a brother trying to explain
[47:33] that one time
[47:37] he said he drove the animals out he
[47:39] didn't drive the people
[47:43] i said well now brother only problem i
[47:45] got is the
[47:47] the animals didn't get there by
[47:48] themselves
[47:50] the people got the animals there so if
[47:53] if he was going to whip anybody he was
[47:55] going to whip the people because they
[47:56] would want to put the animals in the
[47:58] wrong place
[47:59] right
[48:02] see little things
[48:05] little thoughts
[48:07] me
[48:09] well my wife knows i love her i told her
[48:11] 40 years ago
[48:16] and i told her one day if i ever got
[48:18] where i didn't love her i'd tell her
[48:23] no
[48:28] i like to hear the word i love you
[48:32] that's why
[48:34] i made a promise to god you can do what
[48:36] you want to we have signs i know what
[48:38] signs are i know why you pull this one
[48:40] down and leave the two up and what they
[48:42] mean but i know what that means
[48:44] that is a universal sign around the
[48:46] world that says i love you
[48:48] now you're going to tell me it's wrong
[48:49] for me to hold that up
[48:51] i'm going to tell you the background was
[48:53] the one thing that i promised god
[48:56] that every time i'd raised my hands
[48:58] i would give him the sign
[49:00] of i love you
[49:05] you say well that's called
[49:06] no no no i know
[49:08] that means in satan
[49:15] you're going to take a sign language
[49:16] around the world and make it satan know
[49:19] there's a sign language that says i love
[49:20] you
[49:26] have you ever told him you love him
[49:28] i mean really just said lord i love you
[49:33] i'm serious
[49:35] it's good to repent
[49:38] it's good to repent and say i'm sorry
[49:40] but you know sometimes
[49:42] a little word going on the end of it you
[49:44] know to somebody and you say well i'm
[49:46] sorry the way i've been
[49:47] and i love you and i just don't wanna
[49:52] does it hurt say that
[49:56] well i ain't gonna tell nobody to live
[49:58] that's what gets me wade knows if he's
[50:00] here he'd tell you about in a hurry
[50:02] i used to do it
[50:04] man i used to go to these meetings and
[50:05] things and i know how the people of this
[50:07] message are they're so holy and pious
[50:10] you know
[50:12] man i'd walk right up to anybody i
[50:14] didn't care who he was
[50:16] i hugged his neck and told him i loved
[50:17] him
[50:18] wade told me one day he said daddy
[50:22] they think there's something wrong with
[50:24] you
[50:28] i said there is i love them
[50:32] [applause]
[50:36] see
[50:37] i i do i love people
[50:39] well there's no problem to me to hug
[50:41] somebody's neck and say i love you
[50:45] yeah we get on the other side with
[50:47] hugging sisters
[50:50] i got some guys that's waiting now in
[50:51] line where they can hug my wife when we
[50:53] get on the other side
[50:56] [laughter]
[50:58] cause they think she's a good
[51:00] good wife a good housekeeper a good this
[51:02] out of the other doing and i do too
[51:06] me
[51:08] but you see what is those big things
[51:12] it's not the big things
[51:14] that's destroying you enough
[51:19] it's the little things
[51:22] that we don't count as being
[51:28] well i told you that i love you
[51:31] well does it hurt to say i love you
[51:38] does it hurt to be a christian in action
[51:41] you know
[51:42] to try to show christ
[51:44] to others
[51:48] you know one thing for sure your kids
[51:50] gonna act like you
[51:52] you ever watched them
[51:55] you watch them
[51:56] you watch them kids if you don't watch
[51:58] them you just watch them and you'll
[52:00] start walking down the road one day and
[52:02] you got a certain little affliction when
[52:04] you you know you you
[52:06] and you you
[52:08] kind of do and you just watch that
[52:10] grandkid coming along behind you and
[52:11] there's coming behind you
[52:18] because he's acting like paw paw
[52:21] see
[52:22] all right
[52:24] it's the little things that we leave
[52:27] undone
[52:29] it's what i'm getting at
[52:31] it's not a great big i don't think now
[52:33] seriously you think what you want to i
[52:36] don't think there's going to be a
[52:37] building sitting there and we get to a
[52:39] place because
[52:41] you tell me where it's at now that's
[52:43] when i said i've i've studied the
[52:45] message so come on you show me where
[52:48] that place is at where the the judgment
[52:50] seat of christ takes place i've looked
[52:52] through the prophet's message it's only
[52:53] like 300 something times he mentions
[52:55] that
[53:01] but you see why can't we think about it
[53:02] being right now
[53:04] right
[53:08] i don't want no trouble at the river do
[53:10] you
[53:11] let's see if i can find that one in a
[53:12] hurry
[53:21] well get my own notes messed up can't
[53:23] even find it
[53:32] all right
[53:34] if they can pull up number
[53:37] 10
[53:38] pull up number 10 if you can brothers
[53:40] because we won't spend much time we'll
[53:43] get rid of
[53:44] get going
[53:50] i'll start reading now catch up with me
[53:53] okay
[53:55] and i appreciate
[53:56] many of you people are poorer people
[53:58] than tonight you probably may maybe put
[54:01] in the life nickel you had
[54:03] and that great day when we stand now
[54:05] he's talking about taking people to
[54:07] missionary funds and things that he's
[54:09] taking the money from the people and
[54:10] taking the mission no one going to the
[54:13] mission all right and on that great day
[54:16] when we stand up there
[54:18] at the judgment seat of christ
[54:22] and there's going to be a place there'll
[54:23] be a place to stand or whatever
[54:26] and you hear those heather and screaming
[54:31] when i
[54:32] after you hear my name called
[54:35] and i got to come up and stand on the
[54:37] tape
[54:39] recording will be played
[54:43] and the screen will show
[54:46] at all
[54:47] and some of those
[54:49] natives
[54:50] and heatherns
[54:52] from the other countries saying oh
[54:54] brother branham
[54:56] if you hadn't
[54:57] come
[54:58] i'd have been lost
[55:01] and then god will look down to you
[55:03] and say
[55:05] you were the ones that sent him all
[55:07] right see how he's putting it all
[55:08] together
[55:09] if there's any blessing to be out
[55:12] of it may you receive it because i'm
[55:14] just going do it doing as a duty
[55:18] okay watch them jump down i'll be glad
[55:21] to have prayer with you at any time
[55:23] you pray with me we we meet again
[55:26] is now watch him may we meet again is my
[55:30] prayer
[55:31] somewhere
[55:32] this side
[55:34] of the river of life
[55:39] now where is this
[55:40] judgment seat of christ going to be
[55:42] somewhere on this side
[55:44] of the river of life
[55:48] are you reading
[55:52] and have a good old-fashioned meeting
[55:58] you know there's going to be a
[56:00] after the resurrection about 30 40 days
[56:02] that the saints are going to be among us
[56:08] before the rapture fully takes place
[56:14] where's it going to be and have a good
[56:16] old-fashioned meeting
[56:18] again here in america
[56:20] before we cross the waters
[56:28] i mean
[56:29] that last water
[56:34] i mean the last water
[56:39] it's going to be on this side of the
[56:40] river of life
[56:44] now we as christians there's
[56:45] terminologies of people in their words
[56:48] you may be a little different but you
[56:49] know what i'm talking about on the other
[56:51] side the river
[56:52] i don't want no trouble when it comes
[56:53] down to the river i don't want to answer
[56:55] that or the other i want to be make
[56:57] everything right here before we get down
[56:59] to the river you know i don't want
[57:00] nothing to have to be judged
[57:02] well see that's a good place to be
[57:05] and see that's right now
[57:08] i believe right now is the judgment seat
[57:11] of christ and i believe judgment must
[57:14] first begin at the house of the lord
[57:16] which is right behind the pulpit
[57:19] and go out from there
[57:22] all right
[57:23] not bad things
[57:26] i don't know of ever
[57:27] i've known tony probably what 15 20 30
[57:30] years something like that
[57:32] man we've been [snorts] around together
[57:33] a long time
[57:35] i don't know of one thing
[57:38] that i could ever think of
[57:40] that i ever thought well tony don't
[57:43] don't love me
[57:46] now that's where you're different than
[57:47] me
[57:49] and i'm not mean against tony because
[57:50] tony sometimes sold up a little bit
[57:53] he may not act like he loves you
[58:00] but see i know he does
[58:04] i know he'd do anything i ask him
[58:10] we used to we'd talk about him and kind
[58:12] of life about him because he was just
[58:13] kind of quiet
[58:15] we got some videos because even his wife
[58:17] didn't know what he could cook
[58:20] nobody didn't know all of these things
[58:22] could be done when we went up on the
[58:24] mountain
[58:25] camping out with all of the kids of the
[58:27] church and all the boys and
[58:30] and here's tony all at once he's
[58:32] grabbing pots and pans and he's cooking
[58:34] and everybody's looking around nobody's
[58:37] saying nothing there ain't nobody
[58:39] hindering him and telling him to stop
[58:41] they're just standing back officer hey
[58:43] hey look at tony
[58:45] he's cooking
[58:47] well you know
[58:49] we found out he could cook now what did
[58:50] hey tony
[58:56] you understand
[59:00] you don't have to show me all of these
[59:01] great big things of the world or give me
[59:03] everything in the world to be a
[59:05] a
[59:07] part of a body of christ or whatever as
[59:09] pastor you don't have to give me a this
[59:11] you don't have to make it every other
[59:12] week that we do these things you know or
[59:14] something
[59:18] well because i'm just what i am
[59:23] i'm just what i am and what i've always
[59:25] been
[59:26] i've always just been the basis that i
[59:28] love people
[59:30] and i want them to love me
[59:35] since the barber back there she had a
[59:36] dream one time and said
[59:39] she
[59:40] saw me walking around and said
[59:43] one time i'd have one on my shoulder i
[59:46] said i'd set it down i'm just talking
[59:47] about you
[59:48] okay so the next time i'd have a
[59:50] different person sitting on my shoulder
[59:52] walking around and carrying them
[59:55] he said that's the way you do well
[59:56] that's the way i want to do
[59:59] i'm trying my best to break it down to
[1:00:01] one thing listen
[1:00:03] it's not the big sins that
[1:00:05] that's the problems with all of us
[1:00:10] if it is we have ways of dealing we call
[1:00:13] people up in the front of the church
[1:00:14] they either repent of this or get out
[1:00:18] why because we don't want the world to
[1:00:20] have the idea that we're just sinners
[1:00:22] and
[1:00:22] and just living and doing everything in
[1:00:24] the book
[1:00:26] i'm like the apostle paul paul was got
[1:00:27] so upset there where he said a one man
[1:00:30] you know living with a man's father's
[1:00:32] wife in other words his stepmother or
[1:00:34] step wife or whatever he
[1:00:37] but he tore into him
[1:00:41] but you know what
[1:00:44] if that man straightened up
[1:00:48] paul didn't throw him out
[1:00:54] because paul knew
[1:00:56] he was the guy that knew that's what
[1:00:57] i've tried to tell you
[1:01:00] for me to read the bible is easy because
[1:01:02] i've always just read it and studied it
[1:01:04] and read it
[1:01:06] and even when i was
[1:01:08] you know a baptist and just coming to
[1:01:10] the lord and
[1:01:12] and i'd read that and i'd get over there
[1:01:13] where it says and someone so because
[1:01:15] so-and-so and so-and-so begot so-and-so
[1:01:16] and so-and-so begot so-and-so and so and
[1:01:18] so forgot so and so forgot so and so and
[1:01:20] so forth
[1:01:22] and while i get so tired of saying
[1:01:23] so-and-so with a soul i just quit
[1:01:27] you know
[1:01:29] but you know what happened one day i
[1:01:31] began to look over there and it said
[1:01:33] and so-and-so begot so-and-so and
[1:01:36] and i'm just paraphrasing one and david
[1:01:39] said
[1:01:40] i love you lord you know there's
[1:01:42] something right in there you know what
[1:01:43] i'm talking about it'll just be right in
[1:01:44] the scripture readings of you reading it
[1:01:47] of the so-and-so of god so and all at
[1:01:48] once it just brings christ right into
[1:01:50] view
[1:01:53] i've always had trouble reading i don't
[1:01:55] mean trouble i mean
[1:01:58] i'd rather read somewhere else than read
[1:02:00] first corinthians
[1:02:02] and especially ii corinthians
[1:02:05] not that i had any problems
[1:02:09] the problem was
[1:02:11] i found out later paul was talking to me
[1:02:14] about me
[1:02:16] because that's what paul is doing the
[1:02:18] corinthians means literally what it is
[1:02:20] it means the word of correction
[1:02:22] corinthians means correction
[1:02:25] and see that's what paul was constantly
[1:02:27] after them
[1:02:29] there that he had to get onto him about
[1:02:31] the gifts he had to get onto them about
[1:02:33] all kind of things he had constantly
[1:02:35] stayed after the corinthians because he
[1:02:37] wouldn't line up
[1:02:39] it was the little things
[1:02:42] that they were just passing on by
[1:02:46] i'm thinking well bless god we've got it
[1:02:48] made we ready for the rapture
[1:02:52] that's what's so odd to me you talk to
[1:02:54] people and say
[1:02:56] well brother dale
[1:02:58] i'm just afraid to go to church because
[1:03:00] that virus might catch us or something
[1:03:02] but i'm ready for the rapture
[1:03:05] i'm ready lord anytime the lord wants to
[1:03:07] come
[1:03:08] where's he gonna come
[1:03:12] is he gonna have to come to your house
[1:03:20] but we're christians
[1:03:23] yep the little bitty thing
[1:03:30] that constantly keep putting us down
[1:03:33] i'm just talking about me
[1:03:38] because we're all just human beings
[1:03:42] we're in that group but paul calls the
[1:03:44] galatians the works of the flesh now
[1:03:47] remember he's talking about christians
[1:03:49] and says they have works of the flesh
[1:03:54] well i said it's hard sometimes to read
[1:03:56] to what he's just saying because he
[1:03:58] calls it adultery
[1:04:00] first thing he says on the works of the
[1:04:02] flesh
[1:04:04] well you don't ever think like this
[1:04:06] adultery
[1:04:08] well there ain't nobody here in the
[1:04:09] building committing adultery
[1:04:14] what about
[1:04:16] you're looking and you're lust in your
[1:04:17] things of your eyes
[1:04:26] what about uncleanliness being
[1:04:31] the same as lasciviousness which is lust
[1:04:37] my brother dale i don't have no problem
[1:04:38] with lust
[1:04:43] little small things
[1:04:47] idolatry
[1:04:53] idolatry he said we don't have no
[1:04:55] idolatry we're not we're not worshiping
[1:04:57] idols
[1:05:02] webster says the worship
[1:05:05] of other gods
[1:05:11] what if you're a trinitarian
[1:05:16] that's another god
[1:05:19] because it's just one true and living
[1:05:20] god
[1:05:22] little things
[1:05:27] what about hatred oh i don't hate nobody
[1:05:32] could it be just a little bit of enmity
[1:05:38] variance
[1:05:39] could it be strife or contentious
[1:05:44] emulations
[1:05:49] strife
[1:05:51] just be in contention
[1:05:54] heresies
[1:05:56] this being of a sect
[1:06:03] murderers
[1:06:10] you hate your brother without a cause
[1:06:12] you're a murderer
[1:06:16] that's breaking down the bible to
[1:06:19] smaller words that we human beings can
[1:06:22] comprehend do you get it
[1:06:25] oh no we're not ain't nobody building
[1:06:27] here murdered anybody
[1:06:32] one word uttered
[1:06:36] could be murder
[1:06:40] now you don't think we're going to have
[1:06:41] to give an account
[1:06:45] you don't think we're going to have
[1:06:46] anything one of these days that there
[1:06:47] could be a judgment seat
[1:06:50] i'm trying to get you to see that's
[1:06:52] that's the problem when we think we
[1:06:54] don't have it that's where we have it
[1:07:01] well i don't have no problem right
[1:07:02] there's the problem
[1:07:04] you're not admitting who you are and
[1:07:06] what you're doing
[1:07:12] what was that uh message brother
[1:07:14] uh
[1:07:16] luis is preaching about
[1:07:18] drunkenness and
[1:07:21] and about being
[1:07:22] uh
[1:07:23] [snorts]
[1:07:23] how is it drunk on the spirit drunk on
[1:07:26] the wine drunk on it it's not always
[1:07:28] this big drinking drinking it's a lot of
[1:07:31] other things
[1:07:33] it could be
[1:07:36] just go home and
[1:07:38] take that and read it
[1:07:41] and see how simple the things could be
[1:07:43] that we have those things
[1:07:49] hate you brother without a cause you're
[1:07:50] a murderer
[1:07:59] what are we supposed to be
[1:08:12] waiting till one day that there's going
[1:08:14] to be a great big
[1:08:16] building we're all going to have to line
[1:08:17] up in a building and walk down through
[1:08:19] there and
[1:08:20] no
[1:08:23] taking place right now
[1:08:28] because you see
[1:08:29] if he takes away rewards that's one
[1:08:31] thought
[1:08:33] but what about lining up with the word
[1:08:35] in your adoption and your stature of a
[1:08:37] perfect man
[1:08:38] what about lining up to where you get to
[1:08:40] these words
[1:08:45] [snorts]
[1:08:48] oh i don't have no problems with
[1:08:50] drinking
[1:08:55] patience godliness
[1:08:57] temperance
[1:08:59] i don't have no temper
[1:09:06] and paul i'm excused with peter peter
[1:09:08] evidently thought we had him
[1:09:10] because he mentions it right
[1:09:15] but i i just don't i don't you're not
[1:09:17] getting it brother dale we're we're not
[1:09:20] getting right i know i'll agree we i'm
[1:09:21] not getting it i'm not getting to the
[1:09:23] basis of one thing
[1:09:25] we're letting these little bitty things
[1:09:28] why do you think we're here now
[1:09:31] when i can quote your prophet pretty
[1:09:32] heavily
[1:09:35] where he would talk about
[1:09:37] the coming of the lord was way overdue
[1:09:41] whose problem is it about the coming of
[1:09:43] the lord
[1:09:45] well time just hasn't run out now don't
[1:09:48] start that
[1:09:50] it ain't time
[1:09:53] it's you and me
[1:10:00] what about it
[1:10:04] come on musician
[1:10:06] what about it
[1:10:12] the prophet of god i'll show you if you
[1:10:14] want hundred i don't know if not a
[1:10:16] hundred close to a hundred
[1:10:18] where he says we must all meet at the
[1:10:20] white meat at the
[1:10:22] judgment seat
[1:10:24] of christ
[1:10:27] he said i'll meet you there
[1:10:31] [snorts]
[1:10:35] we're all going to have to give an
[1:10:37] account for the little things that we
[1:10:39] didn't get straight
[1:10:42] now watch it as i say it
[1:10:45] taken away is
[1:10:48] not involved in it because god doesn't
[1:10:50] give you something and take it away
[1:10:52] i wish you'd listen to the next few
[1:10:54] moments
[1:10:55] it's not that god gives you things and
[1:10:57] takes it away from you
[1:11:01] he's not an indian giver he doesn't do
[1:11:04] those things
[1:11:07] he'd rather give than to take away
[1:11:13] what if it is the fact that the reason
[1:11:15] we're not climbing the statue of a
[1:11:16] perfect man through the virtues and the
[1:11:19] things like that the adoptions that we
[1:11:21] talk about others other doings and all
[1:11:23] of
[1:11:24] the child being tutored and trained and
[1:11:26] governed
[1:11:31] what if it's not that he's taking away
[1:11:34] what if it's the fact that we're not
[1:11:36] we're not walking correctly so we're the
[1:11:38] ones that are
[1:11:41] losing the reward
[1:11:45] what if it is that we're we're giving it
[1:11:47] up
[1:11:49] by our actions
[1:11:51] by our doings
[1:11:55] you see church that's why i don't preach
[1:11:57] like all these other preachers and i'm
[1:11:59] sorry to just i believe in a holy living
[1:12:01] i believe in living for christ
[1:12:06] but you don't hear me preaching about
[1:12:07] women's dress and clothes and hiring and
[1:12:10] doing all this
[1:12:12] i talk about what's causing you to do
[1:12:14] that
[1:12:17] what's causing you women to cut your
[1:12:19] hair
[1:12:20] you have brother dale you're not
[1:12:22] supposed to know
[1:12:23] i can look at people's hair and tell
[1:12:25] whether or not you're cutting it
[1:12:29] and i never understood that
[1:12:32] i'm a human
[1:12:34] come on comical human
[1:12:36] i never understood it women
[1:12:39] how you trim your hair
[1:12:42] and yet you hide it to try to keep
[1:12:44] people from seeing it
[1:12:50] but you know you know the reason they
[1:12:51] see it you cut it straight across
[1:12:55] what's that why
[1:12:58] why do you women cut your hair straight
[1:12:59] across
[1:13:00] you're automatically telling it's being
[1:13:02] cut because hair don't grow
[1:13:04] straight across
[1:13:09] right
[1:13:10] you see you look at women and their hair
[1:13:12] is cut straight across
[1:13:14] well my hair's never been touched in and
[1:13:17] uh i talked to one here about that they
[1:13:20] used to burn the ends of it just a
[1:13:22] little bit
[1:13:23] you know
[1:13:25] you ever thought about that maybe burn
[1:13:27] the ends of the hair just a little bit
[1:13:29] that's not cutting it that's
[1:13:34] see the little thing
[1:13:38] the tempers and the arguments and the
[1:13:40] fussing of us husbands and wives
[1:13:42] i said us
[1:13:49] the little things
[1:13:56] you see that's why i don't preach like
[1:13:57] that because see
[1:13:59] when i preach it i preach it straight in
[1:14:00] other words i can tell you i can look i
[1:14:02] can walk your women across from here and
[1:14:04] tell you how many cut your hair
[1:14:06] because you always cut it straight
[1:14:08] don't do that
[1:14:10] cut it crooked
[1:14:13] [laughter]
[1:14:15] come on
[1:14:17] what do you mean
[1:14:19] cap it up
[1:14:21] it don't look like it's been cut
[1:14:25] brother [clears throat] the hell you're
[1:14:25] crazy i agree with you
[1:14:28] but does it get to point across
[1:14:32] the little things
[1:14:35] that we do or don't do
[1:14:38] and it's not going to be as i said i'll
[1:14:40] say that one more time i don't believe
[1:14:41] there's going to be a great big building
[1:14:43] we're going to have to all line up walk
[1:14:44] down through there did you do anything
[1:14:46] wrong
[1:14:47] did you do
[1:14:51] i think it's right now
