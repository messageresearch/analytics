[0:06] could be announced before today it's
[0:08] gonna have all of us like I say I didn't
[0:10] have a home Thompson Thompson there you
[0:13] go I meant I was gonna say Thomas
[0:14] because next unit maiden name that's why
[0:16] I keep going over in my head oh no Dean
[0:19] Thompson oh not a wife not a doubting
[0:21] Thomas how to down a Thompson and I
[0:23] believe in not a believing high so we've
[0:26] been on the book of Revelation here for
[0:29] the past few months and now we're on
[0:31] Revelation chapter 5 but we'll go back
[0:33] to chapter 4 just for a minute after
[0:37] this which is after the church changes
[0:39] we were talking about last Sunday just
[0:42] for a background
[0:43] behold the door was open in heaven first
[0:45] voice which I heard was a trumpet
[0:47] talking to me and who's me means the
[0:52] bride means John okay so it's us which
[0:55] said come up hither and I will show thee
[0:57] things which must be Hereafter so as we
[1:01] know that's the type of the rapture and
[1:03] that is the rapture that we take because
[1:05] afterwards and as I was saying something
[1:07] be careful the property God tells us
[1:10] something right here that from chapter
[1:12] 4:1 the bride leaves the earth and she's
[1:15] not staying until revelations 19 and she
[1:18] comes back as a wife she leaves her the
[1:20] bride comes back to the wife right or
[1:22] person how much word lady right and
[1:25] there's three and a half years we know
[1:27] that we go to matched up religion that
[1:30] fulfills part of Daniel seventy weeks
[1:32] but this is all to the Jews so from
[1:34] revelations for one to revelations of
[1:37] 1921 is all to the Jews said oh by the
[1:40] way we got regulations 10700 them in the
[1:45] natural part is to the Jews they're
[1:47] still living them you know they got to
[1:49] go through the natural opening of the
[1:50] seals they got to go through the natural
[1:53] beast rising up out of the ocean and
[1:55] this all the different things
[1:57] go through they're going to go through
[1:59] that naturally even revelations 10:1 is
[2:03] a natural happening because he's going
[2:05] to descend to the Jews everybody I think
[2:08] but when we get the revelations 10 if if
[2:12] they had not been for revelations 10 7
[2:15] inserted in there it would be I'll do
[2:18] you saw what about them they get Christ
[2:21] the same as we do that mighty angel that
[2:23] comes down to revelation 2:10 1 is the
[2:25] same by the angel that come to us a man
[2:28] when William rat on me with the Holy
[2:30] Ghost right all right so that's cue me
[2:33] but we see that he also when we leave he
[2:36] goes to the Jews and his Christ to the
[2:39] Jews right because we will look at
[2:43] bankruptcy
[2:44] we'll get to it and this is interactive
[2:46] if you want to prep off you want to stop
[2:48] and ask a question or make a comment
[2:49] go right ahead Freda sure does know so
[2:53] but we can converse back and forth this
[2:56] is not just me this is a this is a
[2:58] Sunday school if you need anybody needs
[3:00] to stop and some doing that's ok I like
[3:02] that because it so it helps us on my
[3:05] parents report school teachers all idea
[3:08] oh boy
[3:10] well you don't have to raise your name
[3:12] just go and so anyway so we go up after
[3:16] this after the church ages we leave and
[3:19] we're gone where we're over here in the
[3:22] 8th day if you're born again today
[3:25] you're already in the 8th day but we I
[3:28] like this word we physically no no no no
[3:31] we physically go into another dimension
[3:33] but we're changed here we're change here
[3:36] no then we physically take our physical
[3:40] bodies there are change glorified and we
[3:44] take it into another dimension while God
[3:46] does his work to the 100
[3:48] well because he's not going to deal with
[3:49] us and them at the same time alright so
[3:52] they're waiting on us to get out of the
[3:54] way so that he can deal with the Jews
[3:57] and fulfill all this scripture in
[3:59] between here and the natural because
[4:02] remember Jews have to have something
[4:04] natural they have to beat by sight they
[4:06] have to be by touch we as Gentiles were
[4:08] supposed to take it by faith not by
[4:10] sight all right
[4:11] but the Jews are built on Darius coming
[4:14] touch my daughter come and do this go
[4:15] and do this but the Centurion siz up I'm
[4:18] a man of authority you're a man of
[4:20] authority amen
[4:21] if I say it and I have a hundred people
[4:23] and you know what he was saying he said
[4:25] if there's a hundred if there's a
[4:27] hundred diseases
[4:29] sir they're at your control whatever you
[4:32] say to them it'll happen
[4:33] it's done you're an authority that's the
[4:36] government of the man of authority
[4:36] you're a man of authority he noticed in
[4:39] Jesus that's some kind of power that
[4:40] nobody on that anyone that he had
[4:43] another soldier standing behind me I
[4:45] believe he had a revelation because you
[4:47] and I have to have a revelation of the
[4:49] same thing so we believe to see knots
[4:52] need to believe but now the Israel sees
[4:55] do believe they have to have a prophet
[4:58] standing on the earth they have signs
[5:00] they have to have this they have to have
[5:01] all these different things and we don't
[5:04] have to have that all right so now get
[5:10] out a party after this I looked over
[5:12] doors over to we go in a rapture but now
[5:15] remember though revelations for is they
[5:18] seen in heaven because he's going up
[5:21] hill but he's going to show him a
[5:23] revelation so he's going to show us a
[5:25] revelation this morning had to send us a
[5:26] prophet to show us as brother Andrew did
[5:30] a perfect job Sunday talking about
[5:33] symbols but those symbols have to become
[5:36] reality that if not they just a symbol
[5:38] the cloud the statue of a burning man
[5:41] all these things it that the property
[5:43] God brought us the church agents and how
[5:45] to position all this and put it all
[5:47] together without that we're just probing
[5:49] we're just sticking here and we're
[5:51] thinking maybe this will happen brother
[5:53] Brown said we can't be in other words
[5:55] presuming that's been chirring without
[5:57] authority but he brought the authority
[5:59] here not just to bring it here and then
[6:02] leave with it he brought it here and
[6:05] distributed it to us
[6:06] so that we at the time of John can take
[6:10] these mysteries and as brother Brown
[6:12] said take the big done he brought the
[6:15] big nuggets you know we have certain
[6:16] length of time to preach the message and
[6:18] then the 500 makes me breaks it down for
[6:22] the people to understand right
[6:25] because let's just listen imitates it's
[6:27] nothing that's your big nugget it just
[6:29] keeps to be a big night but he wants us
[6:32] to break it down and have a personal
[6:34] revelation my revelation is not that
[6:37] we've grounded them revelation my
[6:40] revelation is that God told me through
[6:42] that man and I have a revelation now you
[6:46] know what it does though it coincides
[6:47] with his revelation and it definitely
[6:51] better coincide with God's revelations
[6:53] of these perfect and brother Brown only
[6:55] Noah brought a perfect work he made
[6:57] mistakes he made slips at the time we
[6:59] know that he was a human being but when
[7:02] they come to the pure word and all the
[7:03] doctrines of the of the Bible he was
[7:06] never wrong amen so I mean it was in a
[7:11] spirit so now we're in the spirit so he
[7:13] worried we're in a spiritual realm now
[7:15] and then we saw all this happened last
[7:17] Sunday round about the throne with form
[7:20] 20 elders which is the white 12 apostles
[7:22] and 12 patriarchs aren't in the Old
[7:25] Testament but John must have been really
[7:28] happy because I don't believe there was
[7:29] an empty seat there he stole a cell
[7:31] sitting there all this 20 is a 23 and
[7:35] once he missed that he saw 24 seats and
[7:39] 24 people sitting and John was one of
[7:41] them all right so that's why that's why
[7:43] he keeps me
[7:44] I'm happy if he gets over to Revelation
[7:45] 5 he said I screamed out in the whole
[7:47] world hurt me why he knew he made it
[7:51] okay
[7:52] he saw herself but remember John was the
[7:55] Jew he needed to see and around microns
[8:01] for 26 and upon the seats I saw four and
[8:03] twenty elders we know who they were in
[8:05] white raiment and had crowns of gold on
[8:07] her head so the there's been up there in
[8:10] a position of authority and then out of
[8:13] the throne proceeded lightnings Dunnan
[8:15] there were seven lamps of fire burning
[8:16] before the grommets of the seven spirits
[8:18] of God now remember the seven spirits of
[8:20] God for the seven churches and the Seven
[8:23] for take messengers that were
[8:27] commissioned to give us no listen it
[8:31] wasn't it went Paul Irina's Martin
[8:34] climbing all them standing there
[8:35] it says the spiritual seven spirits of
[8:38] God so it was the characteristic of
[8:40] every church a okay characteristic but
[8:45] remember brother Brown says he took the
[8:46] characteristic of the age and fit it to
[8:49] the man right so the man fit the
[8:53] characteristics of God the spirit of God
[8:55] he fit that for that agent I look
[8:57] brother rather than fit I ringing Irene
[9:00] it's been Iranian property God he's been
[9:03] where he was that night so there's seven
[9:05] spirits who got before the throne sealed
[9:08] glass the midst of the throne round
[9:10] about throwing for peace no one of the
[9:13] four beasts the lion off the man the
[9:15] eagle full of eyes before and behind so
[9:18] in other words it doesn't matter where
[9:19] they turn they all were seemed they knew
[9:22] they had revelation and that to them
[9:24] that we know that's the baptism of Holy
[9:25] Ghost you have all four of those in you
[9:27] today working as a bold lion coming to
[9:33] churches and hops every Sunday and get
[9:36] nothing read your Bible and
[9:39] come to church on windy hope you don't
[9:41] have to get up and come to church or
[9:42] anything but you forget about your chair
[9:46] he comes turn home wait but that's the
[9:48] opps
[9:49] that's the labor that's the burden you
[9:50] know what that's your overcoming power
[9:52] right then you got the intelligence of
[9:55] man which is not man's knowledge but
[9:57] this knowledge this is the knowledge of
[9:59] God not the knowledge of man now the
[10:01] demand will do what presented but the
[10:04] knowledge of God cannot present the
[10:06] knowledge of God is straightforward and
[10:07] true and then of course the Eagle is
[10:12] this aids now which is higher hmm which
[10:17] is the higher revelation you see further
[10:18] and as I've always told you before Chris
[10:23] did the other days the man I still use
[10:25] that what you said in my church but you
[10:28] look at your for combat beasts the lion
[10:30] starts out he's a meat eater but he
[10:33] doesn't start out a mediator he starts
[10:35] out a milk drinker the Ox
[10:38] doesn't start eating grass the whole
[10:41] baby that was born the other night the
[10:43] Coco he's after that milk right now now
[10:46] he will rebel ate himself into eating
[10:50] grass the man sure we love to eat meat
[10:55] but when we start out as no babies
[10:57] drinking milk but now eagle does not
[11:01] know there is no milk bangs and an eagle
[11:06] it's all me own ministry cheers it up
[11:16] and I wish we could poke it down your
[11:19] throat but they do but when they're
[11:21] really young you know they're opening a
[11:22] mouth mama goes shut it down in there
[11:25] that's what we're trying to do now so
[11:28] that you can grow up and give it her
[11:30] heart did you ever study verse 7
[11:32] appearances
[11:33] Hill rings but the faces of a lion on
[11:38] tap a man Alex people yes yes and Ryan
[11:44] had a problem with that because it says
[11:46] they are always moving forward how can
[11:48] you move forward with four sides well it
[11:51] just it turns and in a revelation you
[11:52] need they may not need the man's
[11:54] knowledge you may you may need some you
[11:57] may get up in the morning and need some
[11:58] ox so the officers are going to go
[12:01] forward it's not just a somebody
[12:03] standing with a face of a man facing
[12:05] them it was turned that when you need
[12:09] listen doc don't go sideways or
[12:11] backwards God go forward so if you need
[12:14] the Eagle anointing is forward it's
[12:16] right if it comes to the forefront of
[12:18] your of your of your whole ego go does
[12:21] yours
[12:21] thank God anymore that's right brother
[12:24] Graham said this is my God gave it to me
[12:26] he said it's now mine he said God gives
[12:28] me the Holy Ghost he said it's mine
[12:29] because he won't ever take it back once
[12:31] you give it to me so a lot of us man an
[12:33] eagle whatever you need for your journey
[12:35] is right here I step forward you may not
[12:38] need the intelligence today he may be
[12:40] back here somewhere you know not not
[12:44] hanging around but you may need that
[12:47] bonus of a line you may need the Hawks
[12:50] to get up out of bed to the church you
[12:52] may need the intelligence of man we'll
[12:54] see he's right here the whole time he's
[12:56] not having to twist
[12:57] he's right here he just comes to the
[12:59] forefront of your revelation he has come
[13:01] to the forefront you listen the Holy
[13:03] Ghost is that you remember we were we
[13:05] were I wish I want to try to find that
[13:07] where they at the Wailing Wall you never
[13:09] see them a true Orthodox you be still
[13:13] there doing this now they're not doing
[13:15] this because they just are bowing no
[13:18] they're doing this because they say that
[13:19] God is always in motion their God is
[13:22] always in motion even though they
[13:24] believe he ain't come yet
[13:25] you know the Messiah even though they
[13:28] believe in our area they believe he's
[13:30] still in motion in the way they do this
[13:31] when he woke up that wall they're saying
[13:33] god I'm in motion with you in other
[13:36] words when the Bible says be still and
[13:39] know that I am God
[13:40] man go sit down in the corner somewhere
[13:42] yeah I've always told us that people say
[13:45] well God give me a job and then they go
[13:47] home and sit down in the in the bedroom
[13:49] and don't get out for three or four
[13:50] weeks you'll still be there in three or
[13:52] four weeks because God wants you to do
[13:54] your part well that's the part you do
[13:56] when you step forward you're putting
[13:58] forth and ever yeah you're wanting to do
[14:04] something for God I don't come here and
[14:06] do this because I have to I come here
[14:09] because I want it I uh I'm a postal
[14:14] carrier I deal with all kind of goofy
[14:16] stuff and dirty during the week and I
[14:18] don't want to deal with Christian people
[14:20] all right then we know they had six
[14:22] wings and they flew us I can't get the
[14:23] revelation it's 5 min so in other words
[14:26] thou art worthy so now here revelation 5
[14:29] this is - this is a scene in heaven but
[14:34] this is the whole plan of redemption in
[14:37] one chapter that's my brother around
[14:39] said this is the most sublime scripture
[14:43] in the Bible this one right here there's
[14:47] one that's the most important which is
[14:48] been Daniel but this is the most sublime
[14:51] script from the Bible one because it
[14:53] shows us and the total plan of
[14:55] redemption and it shows us down here a
[15:00] little further because remember John
[15:04] wept
[15:05] John taught the bride because no man was
[15:09] worthy but now wait a minute when we get
[15:12] on down here
[15:17] it says right here where to say right
[15:23] here and that's made us unto our God
[15:25] kings and priests we went from crying
[15:27] babies not know what's going on don't
[15:31] know anything about the plan of
[15:32] redemption we just know we're lost -
[15:36] right here and just nine verses please
[15:39] went from sniffling and crying to God
[15:43] making us not making ourselves as here
[15:48] that's made us a number we our self some
[15:49] 100 unto our God kings and priests and
[15:53] we shall reign on and that's also
[15:58] interpreted in Europe because you gotta
[16:01] reign here first before we can rain on a
[16:04] listen you gotta you gotta rain in here
[16:06] you gotta let dog rain here first before
[16:08] he allows you but look only in 9 verses
[16:11] we went from somebody that was unworthy
[16:12] to somebody that was worthy to even rule
[16:15] the world back to where Adam was in the
[16:17] Garden of Eden and brother Graham tells
[16:19] us he says if we're going to be kings
[16:21] and priests we got to be have something
[16:23] to rule over come the stage for a rule
[16:25] and reign and a different scripture says
[16:27] will rule and reign over the earth all
[16:30] right which is back to the Garden of
[16:32] Eden back to where Adam ruled all of God
[16:35] said hey I'll take care of the
[16:36] University you take care of here well he
[16:38] mixed it up but the second one didn't
[16:40] and now that the second one's inside of
[16:43] us there's where the rulership comes
[16:46] from
[16:46] we're promised in this last trkage an
[16:49] intimacy that no other church aids God
[16:51] weren't to sit in the throne his strum
[16:54] not our own throne were to set him his
[16:56] strum as he said in father from John 17
[16:59] he says father I pray that they be one
[17:02] as we are one
[17:03] all right that's true one that's yes
[17:07] that's true one that's true oneness it's
[17:11] not worth like a personal God that's our
[17:15] problem that's why we're still here
[17:16] that's why we've been here for 50 years
[17:18] we think that Jesus is over here we're
[17:19] over here
[17:20] I thought the Bible says my hair isn't
[17:23] going as I thought he just said John 17
[17:25] he prayed that we be one with him like
[17:29] he's one now how many are they
[17:31] between him and his daddy him at the
[17:34] Father 1 so I pray that we be one even
[17:38] is your honor one
[17:40] amen that's the problem we've got this
[17:42] thing where we're a second person we're
[17:44] going to wear another substance no we
[17:46] got it but we will see the new birth we
[17:48] have to realize we are these seven sons
[17:51] of God not a life substance inside but
[17:53] we go back to that what brother Dale
[17:55] have been talking about this 10:04 we
[17:56] gotta go I got one moment and I saw a
[17:59] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[18:01] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[18:03] to loose the seals thereof and know and
[18:07] in heaven or in earth neither under the
[18:09] earth was able to open the book neither
[18:12] to look upon it and I went much because
[18:14] no man was found worthy to open and read
[18:16] the book neither to look thereon we'll
[18:18] stop what they're looking for
[18:19] god bless you thank you for
[18:22] I can't do this Oh Florida
