========================================

I want to see see you in the light of your goal Oh [Music] a lot of you are out of power and holy holy holy well [Music] hey man that's our desire tonight to see him let's go ahead and turn over in our Bibles to Matthew chapter 24 verses 25 to 33 it's good to be in the house of the Lord again and we've been doing a little bit traveling this time of year going to camps and so forth kind of good to get back everything back in to normal you may be right you know you when you travel and get a chance to talk to different people and things that kind of yeah well I'm thankful for what we have and I appreciate brother Wade and go to Dale for the standard they've had all these years and I just I just want to give my rose see how nice and you know that that Sunday School lesson knowing nothing I I don't I don't want to know nothing save Christ and and I believe that the word has being opened up to us and we have a lot to be thankful for let's go ahead and get on into the message Matthew chapter 24 verse 25 to 33 let's go ahead to the to the author before we read that we just thank you God for your grace and mercy to us tonight or Jesus we thank you for the word that you've given to us and we want to all of our desires here tonight is to be able to look into the word Lord and to see more of you and see more of the hour that we're living in to see more of who we are Lord and I pray God is night that you'll open up the word to us Lord Jesus to unlock the mysteries that are hidden all that have been veiled for all of these thousands of years and now we can begin to look and see what has been hidden there's been a secret a mystery and now it's been made plain for us Lord Jesus granite Lord you Justin I won't just be your time a waste of time where we just kind of come together and look at one another Lord but we want to see you tonight Lord Lord what what would tonight be what unless you would coming and and being I miss and so we welcome you when we invite you Lord and we open the door to you tonight or to come and be among us and sit among us and quicken the word to us we pray you that's all of our desire that's my desire Lord maybe even in my heart tonight I could be sitting on the front row and get something for myself Lord that I pray Lord that you'll just be welcome among us tonight we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now this I I think it's a kind of a familiar chapter to us Matthew 24 and I want to just take one word out of this little little scripture but we'll just start at 20 verse 25 and kind of read on down behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold is in the desert go not forth behold is in the secret chambers believe it not for the Lightning cometh out of the east and shine up even under the West so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered together immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors you may be seated the Lord bless his word now maybe just as a little background just to kind of set the stage a lot of those things that we're familiar with and you know some sometimes it kind of gets in our mind that you know the word gives us a warning to not not think that the rapture is way far off you know Paul said a lot of things when he wrote the books that we read in the New Testament about you know there's still a lot to happen that kind of sets the framework back then that there were some still things to come because he knew kind of the framework of what was going to happen and what had to take place but now we're at the time this decision there's a time for all things there's the time to different things that happen an hour we're at the place where the rapture is ready to take place so you know you get you in your head you start thinking well we got to wait many years for the rapture to come and you know we know all the framework of how it has to take place whether Rama said it there but there will be a there could be a little child somewhere that is their name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life and they'd have to grow up and come to a point where the gospel could be preached to them they receive it and then keep growing on up to maturity and then because we've all got to come to maturity we've all got to come together and everything has to kind of work into our harmony for it to take place but now you can see you can see where we are by looking at the scripture and seeing what scripture says about the day and the hour that we're living in you know looking at this scripture it says be careful of somebody says he's over here over there because you should be looking at the word to see where he is for the Lightning coming out the east shining even under the West so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be the son of man will will come just as just as brother Brendan's message circle the globe and it went as the message went from the east started off in Jerusalem and went to Greece and England and kept on moving around the world all the way over to the west that's how the coming of the Son of Man be and you can look at the times and see that the son of man the revelation of Christ in his fullness has gone around the world now and this scripture has been fulfilled now it's even going all the way around to this one little nation over in Japan where there's a few that are picking it up and it's going all the way around the world so be real careful when you begin to say in your mind well we've still got a long way off because the scripture is becoming fulfilled in your ears in your sight and then that next that next verse it says for were so ever the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered together and we know how the down through the church ages the four seals the lion ox and man an eagle have been fulfilled and now we're at the eagle time where the Eagle message has been preached and the Eagles and the Eagles have received a message have begun to realize what the message was about and beginning to see themselves in the scripture and beginning to preach I was listening to I like to listen to different ones and maybe that might be ill-advised but I just just kind of sit and listen I feel confident that that you know if something at this point in my journey that I would be able to kind of identify something with a little bit off or whatever but you begin to notice that that different ones are preaching things like ye are God then that and things like and elevated like a capstone revelation and because the bride all around the world is beginning to realize what's taking place we're not in like a little baby floor message anymore although some are some are you know where everyone when you know when you preach there's some that are that are kind of a different level there's a teenagers and moving on up at different levels you know because when you preach there's different audiences as unbelievers make believers real believers different ones that babies children teenagers mature Christians there's ones on the internet all around the world so you're really preaching to a lot of different things but the bride is beginning to catch old to who she is so I wonder you know you maybe maybe take this as a thought could you we think of the rapture as an event a place and it is if there's going to be a place where we step from time on into eternity but the rapture is happening right now so check up with yourself are you missing the rapture because the rapture is when the word begins to open up to you and you know that little Sunday School lesson I was talking about is savour the word savor get a get a revelation of what the word is doing and what is what it can do what it's there for and then give everything that you've got to the word because the word is what's going to take us out of here and if you miss the word if you miss the purpose of what's happening then you could be missing the rapture is my point then reading on on down these 30s digital verses that I just read immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened the moon shall not give her light and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory we know some of these scriptures they're speaking of different events and time and everything but you know we have seen that the cloud come down the picture of the cloud that hangs in many of our houses and we've seen this sign of the Son of man coming we've seen the side we've seen his appearing now I went what maybe to ask have you seen his coming we've seen the appearance of him but have you seen the coming of the Lord is he coming to you the opening of the word and he shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds which is what's happening right now from all around the world his elect or being together together you know think about this now because we're in a time now a treacherous time what the Bible says that the teacher the tears will be gathered together and what God does is he separates this and he separates that and he gathers off he starts to bundle these and bundle these together we're in a bundling time where he's bundling everything together in the way that it should be gathering together and he's gathering the Eagles around the word because that's where the Eagles will be gather together around the carcass where the carcass is the fresh kill you'll be gathered together now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh now see there's the other big example of looking at the time and the signs and things to see where we are we're right here at the hour you know brother branham priest years ago about looking at Israel and seeing when the fig tree put forth our bud years ago years ago when they first became a nation and they begin to blossom into a country and begin to make things so that they could harvest water from the air and and and put to just building their economy and now they're in a position in a place where you look over there you see how what else is there to do for them to become a nation what else what else can be left so that's a sign for us when we look over then we see Israel putting forth her buds you know that the time is not something is fixing to take place and I believe that all the bride around the world is getting ready she's more hungry and thirsting than ever I believe now we've heard the word so now is the time that we should be consecrated and dedicating our lives so that the word can be fully made flesh in us so that we give everything this is the time this is not the time to be babying around but this is the time to just fully dedicate your life to the word and then this last verse so likewise ee when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the door so I want to take for a topic tonight that word doors because you know there's in Scripture there's a lot of doors the whole scripture talks about gates and doors doors in and out doors opening a door shutting doors this way and that way and scripture is full of doors scriptures scripture talks about there's people around the doors there's porters and Watchmen and scare crows outside of the doors to keep you from going in the doors when you go out of a door God wants you to go into another one because doors represent all of these different things that I want to talk about tonight doors represent a transition that he's taking you from one place to another like from one room to another and in your in your journey you're going from this to this to this that he keeps opening a door I maybe want to what on one thing I want to talk about tonight is how do you get a door open because there's a secret if you know how to get the door open then you can keep progressing you can keep moving you come to a door and that's what happened in the old testament they would they would come to the door of the Holy of Holies and they look at see all of these they knew all of these things were these mysteries were back there that they could barely to comprehend they didn't know what it was for they held is the shewbread and all the things in the the tables of stone that they you know they were misinterpreted almost as just something they had to do to keep and they didn't quite understand what it was and they saw that the cherubims on the embroidered on the on the the curtain before the Holy of Holies and all those things but they couldn't get passed in there every now and then and every when that when the right time came when the right season came a feast or whatever all the different things and a priest could go back and taste of the manna once a year the the high priest could go back in there and do the things that he did but it was it was very sporadic it wasn't a continual way you didn't have a continual way to get back into there the Holy of Holies it was shut off from you it was blocked off how do you get in there how do you get into the promises of God how do you get into a door so you know going back to that thought of a transition God wants us to keep moving when we get to a little place in our life don't don't just stop and feel like you're that's where God wants you to be he always wants you to keep moving higher and higher and higher because you you get to a place in your life and there's all to a higher plane keep moving up moving up because you know if we kind of go back to the to the is realized down and easy up how they they they can't they kept moving through like what you would almost call rooms they were down in Egypt and that would be a room they were they were their pilgrimage of slavery and everything and then God took them into that room of the where they had to put the blood over the little of the door and the Death Angel came by and look to see where the life was with whether whether the life was shown the token was on that door and then he kept moving and he said now I'm going to take you from here now I'm going to take you over to the sea to the to the Red Sea and and they stopped there how we going to get across that's when the gods came down to Moses he said why cry speaker and you know all those things just hold your staff out and just keep moving so how did they get across the Red Sea how do they how did that door open up so that they could cross over well it opens up the same way that everything else opens up by faith because that's how you you won't that's the faith is the key to unlock the door and you know brother Bram said in one place I don't think I have this quote but he said you just believe and God will go before you and open up the door you just keep walking in faith believing and God will open up the door and that isn't that how the Israelites did with the Red Sea they just came to the Red Sea and and they believed and kept taking the foot a footstep and just kept marching on looking all around and maybe the whales swimming by everything my goodness but they just kept walking on walking on one step after another and before long and they went from that room into another room now they're in the wilderness but that's not where God wants you to stay either now you're in the wilderness and you've got the manna and all the different things of water coming from the rock but the goal is not to stay there the goal is keep moving and so they came out because because you know the pattern of the scripture is that God doesn't take you out to just just stop right there he takes you out to take you in if you come out and you don't go in then you've missed the whole point so many I feel like it maybe this is a little bit critical but so many have come out of denominations and everything I just kind of sat there in the wilderness we're going around and around and around and haven't fully gone in he doesn't take you out just think Duchess let you sit there but you got to go in so we're going to talk about that tonight how by going in how do you get in how do you get Christ in you so there they are in the wilderness and he takes him from that room he takes him on over ready to go on over into Kadesh Barnea now there's the big test they go from this room to this room to this room that's all right now here we come to Kadesh Barnea and they couldn't keep going on so doors are a transition right they mark off transitions you're moving from this place to this place to this place another thing a room is is a separator because when you go from this room to this room when they crossed over the Red Sea they look back in the Egyptians were gold they were dead the whole army was dead and that's what that's what the when you walk through the door of the new birth that old life is gone it's supposed to be going it needs to be gold if it's not gone go back and examine things a little bit more make sure that you really did go into the other room because you're supposed to look at supposed to separate you're supposed to make you not love the things of the world anymore it's supposed to make you have a different set of friends because the old set of friends used to want to do different kind of things it oscillates you from the other side and you're Jesus even talked about how that how that would make you an odds and ends with you're with your family with your with your mother and your father and your sisters and your brothers and everything because how can two walk together and let's say agree and that's kind of you know but the last sermon that brother Brandon preached was that communion sermon and that's really a lot in that communion sermon how can you really walk together unless you agree there's always going to be a little bit rubbing there thing when you get down and sit to talk with somebody then then you find out whether whether you're really inconvenient or not you know program said that's what communion is it's not a one-sided thing it's two-sided you you're talking and and in in the case of your communion with God God will speak back and we're not talking to just some kind of Idol or something we're talking to something that will speak back and so what do you speak to God you speak his word if you don't know the word then you don't have anything to speak to him you don't have anything to say to him and so that's what's community is a convenient Communion or this door is a separator it says when you go into the Holy of Holies when the high priest every year went into the Holy of Holies that separated him off so much from the rest of the congregation that in the Old Testament they had to put little bells hanging onto him so that they would know whether he was still alive or not because he was separated he was off to his own the light of that that behind that inner veil was what was giving him life so he could see he wasn't going by the light of the Sun of the moon or the things that they could set and rise every day but he had a constant light back in there with the Holy of Holies and that's what it does with a real believer it separates you from the things of the world so that you begin to see the things that are behind that that holy of holies the rod that budded the tables of stone in the side of the ark the manna you have access to all of those things because that's what happens to a seal a concealed life hidden in Christ Jesus it's not a mixture and you know another thing that a door does is that there's a secret in there and a door is like a keeper of secrets and you know brother Branham talked about that three rooms in a house I you have the the the little foyer there and then you go on into the kitchen and then then you go on into the bedroom and I know I know some some maybe even sitting here when I have you over to my house you're reticent or to go back with the brothers sometimes we'll go drink coffee stuff up in my bedroom and we'll sit around and talk about the word as some of you have said before well I don't like going and sitting around in bedroom why because it's a secret place it's a place where it's really just a man and his wife and and to some and you know really I agree what goes on in the bedroom is not supposed to be come out and shared with everybody but it's causes son between a man and his wife it's a secret thing and so what goes on between the bride and the bridegroom is a secret thing it's something that you can't even do you know that you're talking about secret things like that white stone you can't come out and say let me tell you about all the stuff that God has done for me and everything because it's a secret for you it's something that can't be this is not even supposed to be blabbed out to everybody it's a secret and that's what the root the door does it shuts off the secret from the rest of the world so the Royal it's not even for the rest of the world caps not your pearls before swine you're not supposed to be telling everybody about all the things that God has revealed to you because they'll just turn and ring you you tell them tell about the simple things of the gospel and get them convinced that Jesus died for their sins and letting them begin to grow up and begin to see the things that are that are here no secret things in the capstone you can't you can't tell a little baby about what's in the capstone because there's a quote what I said he'd kill them you got to come up the same way the chute is rolling up from a little baby on up up up until they can begin to receive it right and to access the secret you need a key you can't just come up to that door and walk in I presume but you got to have a key what's that key that we were talking about in the Sunday School lesson the key is is what is so misinterpreted and misquoted these days is that they say now the key is will I just believe that God sent a prophet well what did he say what did he say well that's that's fantastic to know that God sent a prophet but he came for a purpose he didn't just come so that we could see a grand show and everything and so they could clown around and everything but he came to deliver a man I wonder if maybe that's how sometimes we're getting off track a little bit of that we look so much at the profit and what he did in the pillar of fire and all those things that we miss what he came to do which is to bring a message and the message was given so that we can eat it like John took the book and ate it and it was bitter in his belly but because he had to live it in he didn't just it wasn't just something that he could read and see a nice little psychology about but it was something that he had to eat and become and sometime that because a little bit bitter that's a little bit hard to do sometimes you're going to suffer just as much separation offenses will come and all of those things and that's what bitter that's what's bitter but the message you was given so that we could receive it and become it I know what the message was about and then you have something to put you in communion with God well you can walk together because you know what the work said that you know who Jesus Christ is and you can see yourself in the word and you know the hour that you're living in and you begin to have an understanding of what's taking place so that's the key I'm talking about the key that unlocks the door is the word faith of the word how can you have faith if you don't have the word you don't even know what's what in the world you believe if you don't have the word of course you got to have faith but you can't have faith without the word I believe God send a prophet or what did he preach excuse me I don't mean to start squawkin so you need to understand I wonder if that kind of shoots over our head sometimes I don't need to understand I don't need to know nothing about the message I just need to I just need to come sit in church you know that's that quote that so often misinterpreted just it is ephesians 4 11 and 12 for the perfecting that lady asks the question she said should I listen to taste should I it's what I get perfected in church and Rama answered it because she was she was looking and if I go sit in church am I going to get perfected well the answer is no not if you just come in in church not if you just come sit into a home and listen to tapes either you got to open the door you got to open the door and then you'll be perfected by the blood of Jesus Christ that's what profess you so you need to understand you need to have an understanding of what the word is and then the door will be unlocked Oh Terrence I'm getting close to my my time because in Matthew 16:19 the jesus said I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven the key is to understand let's read that first quote and this isn't necessarily about keys specifically but this is what's getting on getting us on into thy father and he said we'll skip on down to that fourth paragraph in the face of faith of this I love the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapture in faith to be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight and all that you have seen heard the word that you have preached the signs and wonders that you have seen we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if that be God or not because you know there's a lot of things you can accumulate you can accumulate things that the work place and although all the knowledge from the world everything you can accumulate complexes you can accumulate all manner of things but what he's talking about this to take a rapture you need to accumulate just gather up to yourself more and more and more words why because the more words you have this is a very simple comforter it's a concept that I'm about to share the more words you have the more faith you will have if it drops from the air down into the are but if it's not in the head there's not even a potential for it to drop down a horse of course it's got to be in your head first that's it because s going to be mrs. 101 of course it's got to be in your head first before for it get it off down in your heart I say I don't need any understanding well once this dead brother brother branham just said here we need to be accumulating the word so that we can take because to take a rapture something that has never happened before it's going to take a great a grand amount of faith so to have a grand amount of face that's my word a grand amount a great amount you will need all of this word that has come down to this capstone ministry you'll meet all of that just eat it eat it up until you have that kind of faith and then you won't be confused is that that's that's what's keeping the door shut is our confusion is our confusion we don't we can't we got this one little doctrinal idea over here and another one over here and another one over here and we can't put it all together and so it creates this great big hodgepodge of confusion well we don't know what the word says and when I say we just rhetorically III made maybe believe that bold here I feel like I'm becoming less and less confused about what the Bible says by the grace of God so the word has to fit together into into a grand like like brother Brennan said it Christ is the door then it's like levers in there and the key faith unlock it moves all of those levers and they've all got to move and harmony and everything so that so that the door will open just like a king you put in a regular door it moves all the levers inside inside they're moving it so that the door will open and that's what your faith does you put your faith in the door just as an example I mean really that would almost be a very difficult picture to paint or something that how the door Christ says the door and all these little levers and things I don't know how you would draw that but just kind of a picture of the symbolism that of what's happening when you believe that moves everything so that the door and move it in order so that the door will open so that's how you get access to the mysteries that will give us rapture and faith because we're not called the bride is not called to be ignorant and unlearned we should there is no glory and be it agura and unlearn well I don't know what the Prophet said but I believe him and I want to have the right spirit well if you have the right spirit the right spirit will lead you to the word it would lead and guide you to all truth it would lead you to the word it won't lead you just to being a surreal real sweet person a real condo priest although that's part of it that's part of the picture because we need to have the life expressed the life expressed well where when lovely and kind and brotherly kindness to one another and we put up with one another but there's more to it than just being sweet and everything it's the Word of God being made manifest in you that's bless why I keep going back to the two evidences of faith let me see your revelation if you don't know nothing about the word and how do I know that you even know what it is to be a Christian faith show me your faith and then show me your works show your faith and your works because those two things and you know not necessarily works where everybody's just going around casting out Devils and things but living a godly life like like just sister Hedy right just that's nothing but the truth because when you get confronted in the word the works is expressed you agree with the word you're in communion with a word and it's on display where everybody can see that you are real Christian because you have a revelation of what the word says and you are living it if you're not living it do you really have a revelation of what the word says because a true revelation of who God is will produce the life of Christ in you that's what that's why the word is so important it's not just knowledge it's not just about being an election John not just about no one enough so that you can impress everybody but it's so that the Word of God can be made manifest in your members John 10 790 City on said then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by Me If any man enter in he shall be Schade saved and shall go in and out and fine pasture so you got that we got all these doors giving it going in different directions you got to get into him and in the same way he's got to get in you so you've got a door in you or doors door in doors the doors in door let me get right and he is the door and you've got doors that's why I said at the beginning there's doors all through the scripture doors going everywhere there's open doors down through the sermon seven church stages there's an open door opening Revelation chapter four and we'll get to that in a second so hang on so you got to get into him because it John 14:27 oh that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you if he is the door and you know that we all know the illustration of how in the India and the Middle East and everything over there when they were the shepherd would lay down in the door of the sheepfold so you couldn't get in without the shepherd knowing about it unless you were a thief or a robber and then you got a bigger problem as you're coming in to try to grab the sheep and try to trying to go in some other way than the door but now once you get in the door the Shepherd is there at the door so you can have confidence that nothing is going to happen to you that the shepherd don't want to happen to you now you can't maybe not necessarily say nothing bad is going to happen to you because there are a lot of bad things that happen a long last way that God allows to happen so that you'll grow and become a more mature Christian and one great example I was listening to other day two brother brown telling that's a testimony of how God allowed his wife hope and and Sharon rose to pass away now that that was a very hard part extremely difficult very painful part in his life but it allowed him to grow and and it changed the way from then on he was putting everything on God he was you know he'd never again would even consider saying I'm not going to go with that Pentecost to a bunch of people over there or however was they he explained that situation from then on he was headlong into the going after that group whatever had that group had and so when you get into that sheet fold out the Shepherd's got you he's got you protected your in he's got a like it like joke said i hedge around you and he's watching over you so you should have confidence in that that everything is going to work out in the right way to fulfil his perfect will for you in your life but I want to I kind of got off a little bit right there it took a little detour but going back to the the Christ is the door so when I mentioned earlier that when around a scriptural door you're going to have a lot of different characters a lot of different personalities because whenever God wants to do something whatever he begins to do something then the devil is always watching so you're going to have people on God's side porters and Watchmen and that kind of thing and then on the other side you're going to have people on the devil side it's scarecrows and things people stand in the door not letting others go in and that's where I in this day an hour that that's become the greatest hindrance to people around the message because they've seen scarecrows and so many things have been heard and everything they have been jab and things said that almost you're going to have a limit let me read this brother Brennan was telling about the old old brother Jonas telling his sons Peter and Andrew sitting in the boat before they even knew about Jesus tell them that there's gonna be scarecrows just be aware and don't don't let that get in the way because where there's a false there's also a true that should give you more confidence as that are true to begin with that's going to be stuff along life's way and he's brother did away brother Ram tells us he said my sons come near me he might have said it like this you know we people have looked for a messiah and we know he's coming I'm so longed to see him I thought surely he would come in my generation but it seems like I'm going to go before he comes I'm getting old but my sons don't be disturbed now just before his appearing there's going to be all kinds of fanaticism raised up around him now hadn't been that been true around the message there's been so much fanaticism we know there was so much fanaticism around Martin Luther and so much fanaticism about John Wesley I listened to a little radio show about some of the fanaticism about Martin Luther and I thought I knew about it before but my jaw was dropping after I heard some of the ridiculous things that people did saying that they believed the message of Martin Luther just maybe later I might have a chance to tell you some of it or maybe I send you the link to the little to the little radio show but it's just absolutely ridiculous and that's what's called so many people they see the ridiculousness of it and and then they're there they get diverted away from it but you know the real true believer like when when Jesus begins to tell them about you if you eat my flesh and blood and all those things the real true believer it would everybody else left there were some real true believers that were sticking around and see we're up here we go you got the word and that's what I'm interested in I'm interested in the word no matter what else no matter all the fanaticism and all the things if I have to get beat up and bruised and scarred or whatever to get the word then then let's go ahead and do it so Matthew 23 13 15 Jesus was kind of talking about the things these scarecrows and things around around the door we do it all right four times he said but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you shut up when we talking about the door now you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for you need to go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in and you know brother Branham made many comments about things similar to the scripture and here's one every 7 the rejected singing king he said what we need in the capital of this United States as a president what we need in Congress what we need in our halls of justice is a man who have consecrated their lives to God and are filled with the Holy Ghost and are led by His divine direction that's what we need and I all around all across the board is people that have consecrated their lives and given everything over to God but here we've got some that that don't even know like that scripture I was reading Titus 1:10 in Sunday school about there's many that are unlearned and you know Paul was Paul was very frank and straight in the way that he brought it he didn't kind of dilly daddle around he said there's a lot of people here I'm just kind of paraphrasing they don't know what in the world they're talking about and they stand at the door and won't let others go in and because they're standing on the door preaching doctrines of men commandments of man instead of the Word of God there's no way for the people to open the door if you don't have the word you can't open the door that's why false teachers bring false births because there's no there's no word to bring faith it's just fake stuff woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation now here's some more scarecrows people that are out there for the vanity of their own mind trying to just impress people instead of just being like brother instead of ministers should be a transparent person where you can see right through their life you know what they believe you don't have to ask anybody what they believe because they're preaching it you don't have to ask you to body what how they look if they're a Christian not because they're living in it's just right out there for you to see and brother understands the message influency said we must never get to that place we must always remember that God wants us to be humble the way up is down humble yourself and your exalted and if you exalt yourself you will be brought to a base in other words whatever God wants wants you to do just do it be satisfied with a lot that you have that God has placed you in life don't try to build yourself up with great big prayers and advertising how much money you're given and all those kind of things because all that does is make a stumbling block for people who are trying to go through the door and when you see somebody doing that don't be discouraged because where there's a faith there's a truth that's the greatest evidence that there's a true is a fake woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you can pass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he has made you make him twofold more the child of Hell than yourselves twofold more because it's coming brother I said in this quote here he said it's you can deal better with a street harlot and then I might add my own statement here I'm not quoting then a person like that he said you can deal better with us prostitute on the street or a drunkard in some dive than you can with some of these old Mossback so-called Christians that's exactly right they set down there and blow up like a toad frog eating buckshot and just carry on awful when they know no more about God and a hunting type news about Egyptian nice and there are twofold more child here because now it'll be twice as hard maybe maybe even more than that to get them to move they will open up the door and listen because there's the head is so stuffed with all of this knowledge and things you see that's that's real tough brother Brown brought it tough brother brother branham laid it out there I think I think sometimes we become too much as sissified Christians too many sissified preachers too many sissified Christians they don't know what they believe in the can run around tallest and we're not supposed to be plants that are raised in a house we're supposed to be able to take the wind and the rain and the storm and because it'll make us grow better it'll harden the hardness up right at the end time evangelism he said and if there's anything that's unrighteous and anything that's ungodly is to take an old Mossback church member that thinks they're so good and they can't see nothing through nothing but their own glasses he said that's the biggest stumbling block the sinner ever had they're expecting them people they call themselves Christians to live a decent life to be a different person that's an example that's a stumbling block that's a hypocrite that's ten times worse off than you ever was you'd be better off to be out there like you were you know all through scripture there's all these examples of these stumbling blocks for the people what may be one of the greatest examples was why did they choose Saul if you go back into the scripture and see why they wanted to elect the King was because that was a stumbling block samuel had two sons and he said well I'm going to make them judges and everything and they they just they weren't even really hypocrites everybody knew that they weren't living the right life they were just out there doing what you know taking the people's money and all kind of stuff and it became a stumbling block for the people there they were sitting in right there in the temple doing the job of the priests and Samuel the prophet Samuel was there dead and yet his two sons who are doing what they supposed to do so they began to think in their head well it'd be better for us to have a key than this I'd rather I'd rather have a king like all the other nations and it became a stumbling block and instead of looking at the Word of God they began to look at their own ideas and that's what that's what I'm getting at when you see all these stumbling blocks and things around don't let it get your mind off God off the Word of God but just keep focused on him that's the way that brother Branham taught us is just keep your eye on him and keep walking and put one step in front of the other and keep walking forward and if you keep your eye on him then he'll take you to the goal so my point around all of that was that Christ is the door and if you're trying to get in the door there's going to be all kind of people around the door people to help you people to hinder you people are a great big economy of commotion around that but ignore all that and just focus on him because within him within that door is everything that we're seeking for and if you can receive the word just get just enough word to be born again and keep moving on we're understanding the key to the door he said there's only one door two-piece and he talked about how you think you piece you have our piece when you have a lot of money and you go home and you lay down your bed at night and you don't have peace you'll find out real quick because the real peace comes from laying down on your bed and knowing that if you were to die right then that you would have a home in Hitler and there's only one door to peace brother branham said he is our healing in other words he's the door to our healing because the scripture says I'm the LORD thy God that heals all of your diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other door no other way but through Jesus Christ and now Jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now if Jesus is the door to all these promises of God faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God see it now see all these things that he was just laying out peace and I'll say joy and long-suffering and and the healing and the door to heaven and all those things that he put in that door you can have access to everything if you only know how to unlock it and you can unlock it as simply as just believe him just believe his word and you know we stumble over the quotes for brother and said you don't have to understand it to believe it just just believe and then God will give you understanding the fool the real revelation understanding and then you'll be able to go back and it will keep building on that keep building and building and you'll have the correct understanding you'll be able to have like brother Branham explain and demonology why demons don't leave you begin to have that understanding why things are hindering the church why things are hindering your own life why wait and as you grow like the in 2nd Peter it says without these virtues you cannot see you far off because I higher up you get it's like climbing a mountain the higher up you get the more you can see the more you understand the more you can see about what's the problem with the church what's the problem with your own life because what I though key if the key is faith and faith unlocks the door faith and locks all those blessings and all the mysteries and how do we get faith Romans 10:17 so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God so what do you need to have faith you need the word so you got to get in Christ and he's got to get in you and those are not necessarily two separate events because when he comes in you then you are connected back to the salt before the foundation of the world and you can look back by revelation and see how everything fits together you can see yourself in him how do you do that well just believe so he's got to get inside of you and brother brown talked about how the really the process of him getting inside of you is is a little bit difficult because you got to let go you got to die he talked about the like the little door to the right on the inside of the heart all the little doors and different messages he brought out different doors and this point was he's showing that that everybody's got all these things that you got to let go and with a greater that one of the chief most things to let go is when when somebody is talking to you about the word and you get in your head you've got all these others pride and ego built up that I can't admit I'm wrong because if I'm real I admit I'm wrong - that brother would have the upper hand or some such nonsense like that well the first step you got to do to becoming a Christian as you got to admit that you're lost you got to admit you're wrong you might as well start early and admit I'm wrong so that you can get on the right path so that may be one of the chief most doors one of our problems is that that Christ you know that that painting where he's trying to get in and you got to open the door so that he can come in come in he can't come in without you opening the door because he's a gentleman and he always goes where he's invited he won't come in unless you open the door to him and invite him in and he never breaks the promise he promised that he would give it to you if you open the door and let him in so it's both the easy and difficult just open the door just lay down all of your pride and your ego and your ideas and all these all these doors brother branham talked about the door of pride the door of selfishness it's for me and my group is for my little group over here but I'm talking about God don't deal with it groups he deals with individuals it's not going to be necessarily the church at Lula it's going to be each individual that he deals with each individual you know that's how we you know that's the problem in the message everybody says my group my group and everybody makes a little group and they want to know what group you're from what church do you go to so they can classify you I put you in another group but that's not how God deals with he just will to choose this group not not as the Gentiles he deals with us as individuals while within this group here that could be a lot of different ideas and different things and you just say that you're in this group does it draw what does that mean you sit here in uu one the seed that doesn't mean anything and all these other little doors the door a pride that we were just talking about I'm better than somebody else I don't want to let nobody know that I don't know about the gospel I don't want nobody know that I have a question you a complex pride makes complexes because you start thinking to some of her to my feelings and you you build up this complex and you you will be able to get any further until you drop that off drop it off inside the road and keep on going social standing I'm brother under said in one place somebody was saying I'm over those people talk about the Christians there the Christian the Pentecostals I'm over those people I don't want have nothing to do with them why because it pride gets in the way we make all these little cliques and everything the door of indifference now that's a bad one ended the door of indifference what we get so half-hearted we can't even hardly sit through a church service without keeping our letting our eyelids fall Clews lack of interested these are all things that butter and said lack of concern no empathy no concern for what's going on no concern for the word that's being preached but I tell you what if you get if you begin to savour the word and the word begins to be Quicken for you you get empathy real quick you will begin to run after that real quick you won't have any difference anymore you all be so half-hearted anymore but you'll run headlong bored because that's that's the Christian way God don't want us just to come to a church and sit there and not take party wants to be activated he wants us to be active in the service he wants to be active and and because we're we're not just sitting around but we're part of a living body of the body of Christ and there's some of some that our eyes the prophets some that are the mouth the preachers some that are that hear the people listening and some bit of defeat mover than the hands and the feet and all that but we're all part of this great body of Christ and we have a part to play the door of the private life you know brother and said that was something to resist that's what everybody gets offended at when you come to church and you start feeling like that maybe the word will just be gone out and God the spirit of God will be moving and addressing something in your life and you let your petty feelings get get in the way and you starting elissa preachers preach you know me he's curb my feelings and you can you go home and you got a little complex and maybe you take this maybe you take the CD and the tape you keep playing it over it's talking about me and you just let all these little petty feelings get in the way and what you need to do is just drop that let it go and keep going on sorry I start squawking again I lied to Lumos I'm wearing my time limit you start you start listening to a preacher start talking about talking about money for example they hear the Malachi 3 it says that if you give your tithes then they'll God will pour open the windows of blessing you know what kind of blessing would that be what's the greatest blessing of all the greatest blessing of all you give is the word the word that's the blessing that you get from paying your tithes if you're paying your tithes because you want a great big windfall you want to learn the world well and win the lottery you're not interested you're not even understanding the scripture right the blessing that you get is the opening of the word to you the word laying in your lap so you can eat it and receive it and of course when you start talking about tithes and things like that uh that's my money I made that don't talk to me about giving my money but the Bible says that's not your money the Bible says that's the money of course because now we get on that money and then of course the the biggest debate the major door the door of faith but God could get in that door when you just say Lord I've laid down all this other stuff I've laid down my pride I just want to hear I laid down my indifference I'm going to come to church even if I don't feel like it I've laid beyond my private life I'm going to lay my private life bare you can see everything I've laid down my selfishness I I don't care if this group seems like it's the wrong kind of group of this I've laid all this down and now it's time to just open up everything to God so that he can come in because you know God don't want to just come in and just kind of be put off and aside or anything he wants to be the lord and he wants to have total control over your life he wants to be like the son in the middle of the solar system controlling all of your senses all of your faculties controlling your memory your reasoning your consciousness your affection imagination everything every aspect of your life and the only way that you can do that is if you ladie so let me ask this question tonight will you open the door of faith to God tonight whether I said if Christ could come into the heart come into the door of faith now here's a big statement this is why I think this is why so there's so many problems going on people don't know which church to go to what to believe he said if Christ can come into the heart coming into the door of faith he will make you believe that all things are possible to them that believe so if you have a question tonight how do I know what's right I listen to all these voices all these ministries preaching atewa how do I even choose I don't know what's right I'm so confused well there's the answer to the dilemma first gets a new bird and then he'll do the believing for you brother Bob where is that in the box let me show you it says in Galatians 2:20 and this is one of the scripture you know everybody has a scripture this is my scripture because when I was born again I saw this scripture in a new way and it says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live now listen here's here we're talking about God putting his faith in you so that he does the believing and that that puts you that's what faith is that's why you got to be born again before you can start your journey up the stands of the perfect manner that should be like message 101 but I digress he said I live by the faith not in the son of God but of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so you have your little bit of faith and you you open up the door and and you're just like I know that you died for my sins I know that if I repent you gave the promise and then he steps in and doesn't believe it for you how can you even believe the message without the new birth how can you even preach this message without the new birth good what would you be preaching if you don't have the preacher in you to preach it to believe it get the new birth first and there that will answer all the questions about well who's preaching what and what's going on there because then you have the believer inside of you of course then you'll say well the comforter is the teacher so why don't need any teachers no more I'm brother Branham answer that question to it who were check out Canada he said I just want to get this real quick questions and answers number nine he said you say well glory to God the Bible said when the Holy Ghost has come you don't need any teacher he's the teacher his self oh brother how can you be so little from reading the scripture why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church they say I don't have to have anybody teach me the Holy Ghost teaches me it does to a teacher he says teachers in the church he said all are all apostle teachers are all apostles are all gifts of healing the Holy Ghost set these things in the church he operates them all and each one of them operates orderly so I believe it an understanding the scripture opening the word a part of that is understanding how God is going to bring the word to you now you know today there's this thing going around it well brother Branham fulfilled all of the fivefold ministry and and to that I would say maybe this will be a little bit hearts but let's see how that works out because there's so much confusion over you know you listen to it like for example the Feast of the trumpets and you get all sorts of confused without with all the dates and things and maybe that's kind of a bold things to say but prove to me that you have a revelation you need the five bowl ministries that help you along to have somebody that you can actually question to you need somebody that can hear something wackadoo coming out your mouth and say that's not right and show you in the scripture where it's not right and and guide you low you need like yes what I could do yeah you need like this like they in The Book of Proverbs that says we're like iron on iron sharpening each other and I you know like lose that a lot because sometimes the sharpening process can be difficult we sharpen and we sit and we argue or whatever we talk about it but we're sharpening one another because it's we're making each other well well I never heard that before let me go read that quote let me go look at this scripture net everything and it just builds one another we're all working in harmony towards the kingdom and and because brother Branham he laid down these great big nuggets that that to tie everything together takes a lot of study that's why brother and said don't let a businessman that his objective is making money and making business don't let a businessman get up behind the pulpit because you need somebody that's been studied in the word and been brought up and tutelage in the word that knows where everything fits together that the statute of a perfect man don't just fit over here by itself and the son of man don't just fit over here by itself and and over here there's the son of God but you know how everything fits together and every everything moves and so then you can present a picture to the church that the church can receive and she becomes the Bride of Christ so I am convinced that you need a fivefold ministry and I hold it so I hope y'all know where I stand on that so we're talking about doors and I'm just getting here to the close here for a second I I know I've kept you a long time and I appreciate your patience and it looks like everybody's nice in attendance so we talked about doors doors to Egypt taking you from one room to another doors the door to get into Christ he is the door the doors to get into you so that you have any interest into you but now I want to talk about the door to get out of this time up into into eternity because in the book of Revelation it says enter the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man should have he's got the right to open a door and shut he's got the right to give you a revelation or not give one if you open the door he'll give you a revelation if you shut the door because that's the way it works that no man openeth I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou asked a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name and we know of course we've been taught well that down through the seven churches the people would get all engrossed into their own ideas everything and alone would come a porter and the porter would give the people away to an open door he would preach a message to give them the word to escape the things of that age and they'd be called out of that age to receive the message for their day calling out into a broad age calling out into a but to be part of the word for their age and that repeated all down through the seven churches as a porter kept preaching the word he'd come at the end of the Asian and the people will be called out and and receive it and then that didn't go the door would be open just the same way as all the other doors that we've been talking about were open by faith they would hear the word and believe it a way of escape would be made for them and then that those things that they preached will be denominated and they go the people would go right back into kind of their own little system preachers will rise up and stand in the door and preach their old ideas and everything and then along would come another Porter and I had preached the open door he would preach his message and they kept moving on up and moving on up but now now we're at the time we read that scripture earlier how you look at the time look at the things that are happening around the earth the fig tree tree has put forth her buds there's not going to be another messenger so what's taking place now as a door a way of escape has been made for you and now where they had part word all through those seven churches they had a little here a little there now all of the word has been preached to you all of the word has been opened and so and the reason why that is so important is to give you understanding so that you can step through that door because this message wasn't given to us just so that we could have a little pity patty understanding that was maybe the same as all the other ages that we know that we need a new birth that we know that God sent a porter that he sent a messenger to this age it wasn't sent just just so that we could have an understanding of the basic things but it was sent to give an understanding so that we could take a body change to give us an understanding for example that we are as just did you're just as predestinated as jesus was that you have been justified in a way that you never did it in the first place that you have been purified by the blood of the Lamb that that you are able because the you have received the word that you are able to step from timing over the gap over into eternity to step over that breach I don't mean to squawking over into eternity and then you will be able to partake in the feast to the feast of it in a community and feast the feast of the trumpets after hearing the trumpets the sound are down through the seven churches the trumpet to the Gentiles declaring war now you have an understanding of who Christ is and who you are and you're able to identify who you are and you don't have it there's no more and it's eliminated the confusion so you don't have any questions now about why we are not a denomination or how to be born again or what the evidence of the new birth is or even if you are born again like so many have down what was that sister that had the dream of the statute of perfect meaning that the one sister Shepard that was wondering whether or not she has a new birth because now the word is open to you to identify the characteristics of the new birth so that you don't have to have questions like that anymore so what the statute of perfectman is what the bride tree was and how everything moves because the picture has been painted the masterpiece what the rapture is that the rapture is the word coming to the bride so that she becomes part of the bride and it's taking place right now that seventh seal mystery you don't have to there's you know they're still wandering around the messages the seven seals even open but I believe that we are we should know by now that the seven seals have been open it might not be open to you but it's available the word has been pray preached so they can be received by you if you'll open the door and receive it by faith all of these mysteries have been open so that you can have understanding so that you would have the key to faith to unlock the door and take a body change amen and Isaiah just kind of comparing this scripture in Revelation three seven eight the key of David with Isaiah 22 22 and he says in the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open the key of David because the key of David you know brother Branham explained that the key of David and we're talking about keys to unlocking the door and brother Evan said the key of David so it was typing the marriage ceremony of the bride and the groom in the in the eastern and so forth how that they would the bride would take her veil and place it on the shoulder of the groom signifying complete each ownership that she was his now and so that's what that key of David is that Christ has taken care of his bride he's given her everything that she needs and now he's provided a way to open up that door he said so the key of David signifies that it is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium so in this day the message has been preached the word has been open the door should be open to us a message for their day has been preached all down the seven churches and now the complete word has been preached so that we can take the rapture we should need somebody now to convince us that we need to go to church or that we need to read our Bible or that we need to seek God and all these little things but now is the time to come to a revelation of what's taking place amen and the musicians can go ahead and come I'm just going to finish here but when one door opens before you another door shuts behind you and as you keep going you know there's doors opening shutting and things as you keep moving forward and when this door opens in heaven that's going to be in there isn't it brother Branham is not going to come back and preach another message so that we can catch a last minute revelation that's going to be the redemption will be over and so because of that because Redemption will be over the door will be shut in the same way that Noah's Ark was shut and after Noah's Ark was shut that is when the rain began to fall then brother Brent said the church will be anointed when that door is shut and anointing will come upon the church and I don't have that quote in front of me so I'm kind of paraphrasing but when the door is shut the rain will fall amen I believe that so I want to let's just stand to our feet and you know I believe we all have little problems in their life that we're still trying to overcome so maybe let's just let's just open the door to him tonight to come in and and just deliver us by the revealing of his word from all the little petty things we've got in her life and if there's something something hindering you or something you've got against somebody or anything I pride all those different things that we talked about let's just give it all over the hill so will you just raise your hand and just just say Lord I want to open my door all I want to fling them all open to you tonight and we'll just go all in prayer tonight Lord Jesus you see every hand lift it up tonight Lord God Lord you've heard the word that I preach Lord Jesus I I believe it Lord God I believe Lord and if we'll open our heart that's written in your word if we'll open these doors that you will come in and abide with us Lord Lord we're lifting up our hands Lord Jesus to find the laws of gravity because we believe in Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll just come and help us Lord Jesus to yield is Lord in the coming week Lord in the coming months to yield ourselves more and more to draw closer to you so that we have true communion and true fellowship with you understanding the things that have been hidden in the scriptures understanding the things that have been veiled before our eyes for all these years but now Lord God will flinging the doors wide Lord Jesus that you could come and be the lord of our experience Lord of our heart Lord Jesus and then throwing yourself on our heart oh Jesus Lord God granted I pray that you'll come and be Lord of all Lord Jesus grant and I pray Lord that you'll just take the preeminence for the rest of this service Lord Jesus if anyone has a need Lord God and come for prayer Lord God got pray Lord it according to their faith Lord Lord that it be given to them Lord Jesus that you're little if they don't have faith now Lord God help them Lord Jesus to believe lord help them Lord Jesus that you're flinging the doors why no god I pray granted Lord Jesus is yours just be with brother Dale and by the ways and all the ministers Lord God I give brother brother Dale as many times as he's salt God for us Lord Jesus laboured for us Lord I pray that if there's anything that he needs tonight Lord God that we'll all join our faith together Lord God granted I pray that you minister to whatever his needs might be Lord we ask these things believe in Lord Jesus in your name Amy email family anybody have a need just remember open your heart [Music] open that door to him and he'll open to you you feel you want
