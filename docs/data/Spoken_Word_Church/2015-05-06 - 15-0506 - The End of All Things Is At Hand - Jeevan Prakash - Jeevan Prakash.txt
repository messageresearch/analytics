and uh sometimes I struggle you know even though I come here uh to this country since 31 years this is my 31st year coming to this country and just because of his grace praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so I I want to share uh something thing what uh in the country of India is going on and uh first of all uh you need to pray for me I am going through tough time because last year March 22 my wife she's gone to be with the Lord this May 12th will be 49 years our meing our our our wedding you know May 12th so I miss her and then U within few days you know same April 17th last year my sister-in-law only Sister to Sister Mary she was very young you know 50 52 and she's gone uh by the cancer you know and then uh in the month of March this year uh March 13th my mom she passed away my mother so you know how you know uh so you pray for me I need your special prayers I need God's grace praise the name of the Lord so anyhow the prophet of God said all our loved ones are gone and they are not going to come back but we are going to see them very soon face to face and I believe that with my whole heart praise the name of the Lord so precious brothers and sisters uh also uh at present we have a very bad government very very bad government um worst government in Indian history and uh they are with full majority they are in White House you say white house we got you know uh we call central government you know and and they are the rulers you know and they can do anything and um um at present they are very good our for our prime minister is in very good terms with Obama President Obama and he visited here uh few I think last year uh then um then he invited President Obama uh to as to India as a guest speaker on 15th of August 15th August is our independence day that's the time in 1947 15th August you know britishers left India and and we got freedom so he was a guest speaker there you know in um in Delhi President Obama and uh so you know how many people came with him to India 2,000 Americans 2,000 they came to India as a security you know so um this present prime minister uh is a wicked man because when you in every state we have uh uh chief minister and the governor so when he was a chief minister in Gujarat state state of Gujarat that is Northwest he killed thousands thousands of Christians when he was a chief minister so now is's in the central government in White House in India I don't know what is going to do but and uh he's trying to bring a funny laws and uh his people forcing lot of Christians uh back to Hinduism and uh so um they're trying their best to bring ban because uh you know they are all you know those who are in the parliament at present you know uh except opposition party you know they are all deadly against Christianity and I believe this is the squee time for Christians in India and not only in India all over the world so many Christians are getting killed you know killing and so uh remember uh as in your special prayers by the grace of the Lord God is keeping us and uh helping us blessing us and uh and we are we are working for the Lord and and uh because the Bible says when it is the day you know we must work you know the night is coming no nobody likes to work so uh by the grace of the lord we are doing our best to uh preach this gospel uh in tribal areas and wherever it's possible and also um uh we uh God is blessing us spiritually and uh in sik rabad where I am where P Sam is pastoring there we got uh about 300 people every Sunday by the grace of the Lord including children then Boaz is also uh pastoring two churches there you know and he's also having by the grace of the Lord 2 250 every every day every every Sunday so uh God is using my both the sons uh wonderfully praise the name of the Lord I don't know what I would do without them you know they are they are strong in the message of the hour and and preaching the gospel standing for the truth praise I'm very happy about them and also my daughter Joy and she also sends special greetings uh you know my son-in-law is also is a min pastor and uh uh so remember them also in your special prayers and uh so Lord is doing I'm very grateful to the Lord because my all the children and grandchildren you know they all love the Lord they all love this message and they all go to church and uh and I'm very happy about them praise the name of the Lord so remember them also I bring special greetings from um orphans old widows and the lepers and uh so by the grace of the Lord recently um I think last year you know uh uh two Brethren two two pastors came to us and they said uh we are financially in very bad shape and we and uh we want to send the children away you know and I said don't do that you know don't give up you know and uh so because I don't want the children to go in the streets and die there you know and so by the Grace of the Lord uh boy has also uh got another orphanage we are all working together by the grace of the Lord so all together we have in four places um all together 30 girls and 100 boys you know and and I am having 50 with me in the basement you know uh uh eight girls and uh uh eight girls and uh uh and rest boys you know so uh remember us in your special prayers and because of of your loving kindness we are feeding 200 lepers now I'm I'm I'm not counting their children because lapers they don't want the children to be separated from them you know so they want the children with them so you know but I'm just counting the laap brothers and sisters so Al together in four leapor colonies we have 200 leapers and uh then 1130 orphan children and then we have old widow's home so all together by your loving prayers and loving kindness you know and the sense in this country we are feeding about 400 poor every day three times I thank God for his grace and mercy because God knows how to multiply five bread and two fish fed thousands of people so I believe Jehovah Jara our Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord so remember this PO in your special prayers and also we we have uh every month ministers meeting meeting you know every month we started every month ministers meeting since last year and uh uh we have so many brotherr you know both a lot of preachers there you know they stay in the long distance you know and uh we can't we if we invite them you know we are financially in bad shape you know so but we get 40 50 uh ministers every month there's a pictures in the basement you know please have a look you know and uh uh we gave uh we gave uh clothings about 400 poor before New Year between 20 25th December and 1st January we distributed clothings to the orphans and the old widows and the lepers and the minister ministering Brethren and their wives you know we distributed about 400 people we gave them new clothings you know and uh so um so you can have a look the pictures and photos and uh if you like anything you have them you know so that's my request pra the name of the Lord and uh so uh God is doing great Miracles praise the name of the Lord and uh uh at the ministers meeting uh we uh sometimes I preach sometimes Sam sometimes boas you know after preaching you know we give them lunch you know we feed them and uh then we give them love offering whatever way whatever we can you know so we want our Brethren to learn the message of the hour we want our Brethren you know ministers to be strong you know firm for the message praise the name of the Lord you know true to the Lord you know so that's the reason we are having ministers meeting every month praise the name of the Lord also in once in two months uh we have uh a special meeting uh so in that meeting that's a uh mixed congregation Hindus Muslims and uh you know Janss Buddhas or whatever you say that India got a multiple Rel religions many religions so people come and when they are SI sick they come when the cattal is sick they come they ask for the prayers and they believe in the prayers when the Christians pray they get healed praise the name of the Lord so that's the mixed congregation we get and uh you know that's the time God gives us opportunity they give their heart to the Lord and we baptize 10 15 20 So within 3 months January February March uh within 3 months Lord helped us to baptize 61 people 61 souls in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all the glory and credit goes to him because he saved the souls we are just an instrument you know so praise the name of the Lord and uh um I'm very thankful uh to brother and sister gy you know they take special care of me and brought me long ways here you know and I when I when I see the traffic it was very bad you know but anyhow you know millions of thanks my precious brother West and sister you know so brother West really came U few few times to India and uh he was there for uh sister Mary's memorial service he came to Sister me you know Sister Mary's memorial service and I appreciate them and also U his dad you know uh Papa mro gy God bless them you know so uh I'm very thankful to them so um uh also I bring special greetings uh from the ministering Brethren uh in India and U uh see in 1954 when the prophet of God came to Bombay and uh with the mighty Miracles thousands of people got saved he challenged every religious leader and I when he was when he was there I was a little boy you know I was not knowing anything about Christianity or anything you know but now I I heard from the people who were present you know and most of them are gone you know and they dead and few are there you know sometimes I I hear from them you know great Miracles took place and thousands of people got saved and thousands of people got healed now the prophet was looking for a church Message Church there was no not a single message church but today by the grace of the Lord God heard the prayers of the prophet and there are hundreds hundreds of message groups hundreds of message churches you know in India praise the name of the Lord and uh you know and God is doing wonderful uh things there in the country of India praise the name of the Lord and uh um uh we we me and my sons and and the brethren we are standing for the truth there and preaching the word of God and uh now you know at present is not the safest place safest time because we have a very bad government and and his agents there are many agents in everywhere in the city in the town and they are forcing you know lot of Christians back to Hinduism but so far nobody came to us but by the grace of the Lord and uh God is protecting his bride praise the name of the Lord so remember you know this mission in a special prayers and uh I want to thank Brother Sam and each and every one of you this church is also one of the strong backbone for the mission in India and since many many years you know you are standing with us and supporting us we want to thank you on behalf of the mission in India praise the name of the Lord also we are Distributing free Bibles and Indian languages uh there are poor Christians not in a position to buy the Bibles so we buy from the Bible society in India in Indian languages and since 1986 we are Distributing by the grace of the Lord free of cost you know we give them and even Hindu men come Muslim come give we give them the Bible because this Bible is the wonderful book praise the name of the Lord it came down from heaven and this B without this Bible I would have been a gangster in the city of Bombay and um I would have been a killer and uh robber Thief so but thank God for the word of God thank God for this Bible it changed my life it saved my soul praise the name of the Lord thank God for this gospel thank God for this message of the hour thank God for everything what he has done for done for me in my life I was dying 51 years back I was dying on my death bed but I thank God the god Jehovah Rafa he healed me and saved my soul saved my life and you know so that's the reason since 51 years I'm standing for this truth I'm and preaching the gospel you know in every corner my my desire is to preach the gospel every corner in India amen and you pray for me praise the name of the Lord so this evening time if Lord helps me I would like to uh you know uh preach about the end of all things is at hand right and this is the end time you know that very well right when you see what is happening in the sky when you see what is happening in Israel when you see what is happening in United States when you see what is happening in you know Arab Middle East and India and all these places you see how the enemy is working and uh this is the end time and every all these things should be fulfilled before Jesus comes exactly huh people against people kingdoms against kingdoms you know and all these earthquakes and all these things in Nepal very near to India you know um uh of course you know they are they are with India you know if anybody comes for for for war with them you know uh then we have to go you know so uh there because of the earthquake almost about 6,000 people or 7,000 people died you know and uh you know all these things you know according to the scripture it is fulfilling and very soon we are expecting you know like the prophet said about California you know and there also you know very soon is going to happen so because our our Prophet is the great man of God and uh humblest person on this Earth uh God used him mightily praise the name of the Lord so I thank God for the prophet in our generation I thank God for the message of the hour I thank God for the revelation of Lord Jesus Christ I thank God for his grace praise the name of the Lord hallelujah in verse uh uh chter 4: 7 and9 says but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer right this is the time we need to be sober Glory wake up Christians we need to wake up in these last days wake up be sober and also here the word of God says watch unto prayer right huh Christians are very busy in this world this the prophet of God said we are in Satan's Eden so he's not going to give us time to pray right the devil is not going to give us time to read the word of God come on because this is his headen that's right and God had already warned us Prophet already warned us right we need to be in prayer we need to be sober how much time we are giving to the Lord let us examine ourselves today you know Muslims they pray seven times in a day they call Nam n a a a z Nam now Hindus every day they go to Temple if they don't go if if they don't have time to go to Temple they have you know you know small temple in the house in their own house and they worship you know morning and evening they worship without without worshiping their gods and goddesses they don't eat yeah huh what about Christians nowadays yeah huh lot of Christians they are not having time to read the word of God no time to pray amen huh no time to hear the prophet's voice no time they're busy keeping busy huh oh my we have to examine ourselves in this last days how much time we are giving it to the Lord huh how many Sundays coming to church in a year how many wetness days we are coming to church in a here yeah people take little little excuses I'm talking generally uhuh take it in a good spirit yeah huh I'm generally I'm talking huh how many witness days and how many Sundays we are coming to church yeah huh sometimes you know friends come they're at home huh if they are true CH children of God there if they are true Christians they must bring them to church no matter whoever come right they stay home I don't know how can they do that yeah one day with the Lord is thousand years right uh if if you're absent one day you know you are losing the blessings right precious brothers and sisters take it in a good spirit I'm generally talking you know lot of churches they stopped Church on wedness dayss no more Church on witness dayss only on Sundays because I'm traveling I travel a lot you know brother I'm brother prash here do I have church on wetness days no brother sorry only on Sundays yeah huh what about the other religious people huh they are always there you know we have we have some Hindus in India believe me 24 hours there in the prayer 24 hours I'm telling the truth uh 24 hours they are in prayer they're worshiping you know they're worship shipping their gods and goddesses huh what about us today what about the Christians huh we keep ourselves busy oh oh yeah but here the word of God says uhuh and above all things have for one charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of saints huh oh you verse seven but the end of all things is at hand but is therefore sober and watch un to prayer right prayer amen right without prayer it is impossible to overcome this world right amen without prayer it is impossible to live Victorious Christian Life without prayer we are helpless we can't do anything my precious brothers and sisters that's the reason lot of prayers are not answered because we are you know long ways away from God yeah long ways other religious people you know they you know shaking they come to you know the temples and you know do whatever they want they they want to do for their gods and goddesses but always remember my pre brothers and sisters our God is not made of mud or a dust our God is not made of gold or a silver right right right is not a statue made of wood or a tree right our God is Everlasting you know is is the king of kings and Lord of lords is almighty God he's the creator of Heaven and Earth huh how much respect we are giving to him how much respect how much time you are giving huh that's right to the almighty God that's right H let God help us today precious brothers and sisters this is the time we need to pray praise the name of the Lord hallelujah this is the time you know prayer is very important when I when I talk about the prayer you know I remember this you must have heard about the polycarb great man of God right the prophet of God preached in you know sman Church huh smna church church book cpt4 here is talking about polycarp the warrior of Faith right I like to read this because prayer is very important for Christians amen prayer is very important for the Christian people praise the name of the Lord hallelujah here using our god-given rule of choosing the messenger of for each Age We unhesitatingly declare that the irus was exalted by the Lord to that position you know irus Prophet talked about the irus he was the disciple of that great Saint and the warrior of Faith polycarp right and it is no doubt that he set at the feet of that great man he learned the Christian Graces that flowed from his consecrated life yeah for polycarp was one of the truly uh illustrious sense of all ages when weaved in the sight of a blameless life Glory also the prophet says here you will remember from your own reading that polycarp was mared he was mared for the truth he was mared for God I don't know in these last days if the sword comes on your neck how many are going to survive in other countries they're killing Christians who are you Christian finish H if you're Muslim get side you know huh how many are getting killed what about us today right that's what I always encourage the church in India be strong for the Lord no matter what comes don't worry about the death if not today tomorrow we must go but if we die let us die for Christ let us stand for the truth Glory oh my this man of God oh my here he gave himself up to death but before he did before he died he asked for and was granted permission to pray for 2 hours for his brethren in the Lord two hours 2 hours it hard for the Christians to pray 2 minutes right granted permission to pray for two hours for his brethren in the Lord for the governor for his enemies and his characters now what kind of love you say about this man got what kind of love now the prophet of God said if you want to go in the Rapture you need a perfect love that's right what is perfect love means yeah what is perfect love means it's not Brother Sam loves me I love him he respect me I respect him that's not the perfect love perfect love is unconditional right amen this man he was having a unconditional love perfect love that's the reason he took permission and he was granted to hours to pray and he was praying for his enemies yeah even Bible says love your enemy right if he's sick feed him if he's naked give him clothings if he's in the hospital go and visit him you know the word yeah do we have perfect love today in our lives precious brothers and sisters this is not my ction this is the ction of the Holy Ghost it's for you and for me also do we have perfect love do we love our enemies do we pray for our enemies I have three brother-in-laws maybe I told told maybe I shared with you sometimes but again I want to share it with you you know when I was a young man you know accepted Jesus Christ my mom and dad left me and I was very poor but my mother-in-law sister Mary's mother she was a prayerful woman and she got three sons and two daughters so God talked to her I met their Pastor in one of the convention and one of the meeting and then he invited me to preach in his church and that's the church Sister Mary and all they were belongs to that church and one one once I came and I was I preached there you know and uh you know and uh my mother-in-law decided if I want to give Mary I will give it to brother prakash she decided but my three brother-in-laws they were very proud people proud like a Kings H they were Rich that that time and they were going like a Kings on the motorbikes you know and no respect for anybody and when my mother-in-law told them that I'm going to give Mary my daughter to brother prakash and one day they they were all sitting there you know and I was standing there you know and when she said you

bent away from his body refusing to touch him the fire was refusing to touch him Lord Jesus is coming for this kind of people Glory let us stand firm for God for the truth let us not talk against the prophet let us not attack the message of the hour because this message never belongs to brother Bram this message belongs to the almighty God this message belongs to the is the Holy Ghost if you try to attack this message you are attacking the Holy Ghost you're talking against the Holy Ghost and Bible says there is no forgiveness here or there in the Old Testament anybody spoke against the prophet Moses it was death what about nowadays this is grace period yeah grace period especially the message people are taking advantage of this grace period and talking against the prophet huh talking against the prophet of God Bible says do not touch my anointed by word word or deed and they're talking against the prophet yeah and they're they're they're talking against this message they

advantage of the grace period oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord this man of God you know even the fire was refusing to touch him he was then pierced through with sword as this was done water gust out from his side drowning the Flames his Spirit was actually seen to depart in the form of white dove released from his bosom Glory let God help us to become like polycarp right Jesus Christ is
