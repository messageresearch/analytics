[1:43] that's where God lives
[1:44] so we'll understand what I mean good to
[1:48] see everybody in the house of the Lord
[1:49] if you'd like turning your Bible turn to
[1:51] Genesis 2 and then we'll go to Hebrews
[1:55] 11 Genesis 2 Hebrews 11 member the
[1:59] Valentine banquet starting Saturday
[2:04] making sure try to get everybody to get
[2:06] lined up to where they can 4 o'clock
[2:09] we'll get started and then we'll eat
[2:11] later
[2:11] you know as we go along so you've heard
[2:13] the announcements and all this rest the
[2:16] Lord would give us good weather and good
[2:17] times you know he always has before and
[2:21] we just think it we think everybody for
[2:24] working cleaning about the bottom of the
[2:25] basement out of water again it got back
[2:27] in it was in the other day and well
[2:29] Charlotte's had done vacuumed it up and
[2:32] everything we got here in time enough
[2:35] then to help her clean up today there
[2:37] was just too much for her but we
[2:39] appreciate her her doing her job and
[2:41] trying to help and all that was happened
[2:44] and not only with up running getting
[2:49] everything yet going because that's the
[2:51] way it is we want to make sure we get
[2:53] everything right ok
[2:54] any other announcements other than this
[2:59] banquet okay let's read your scriptures
[3:03] in from Genesis 2 now this is going to
[3:06] be a very odd message I warn you up
[3:09] front it's gonna be very very odd you
[3:12] know because I've had two weeks or free
[3:16] to just ponder what I'm talking about
[3:20] I said of the day she said you just
[3:23] haven't been studying like you been I
[3:25] said well what I do I just go in and sit
[3:27] down and read my notes I said get up and
[3:30] go back out the next day I go in sit
[3:32] down read my notes you know add a few
[3:35] words and next day I do the same thing
[3:37] so I'm studying it it'll run around
[3:41] alright Genesis 2 will start reversed
[3:47] for
[3:49] these are the generations of the heavens
[3:53] and of the earth when they were created
[3:56] in the day that the Lord God made the
[3:59] earth and the heavens now I wanna say
[4:03] something to you if you look at the
[4:07] scriptures and get them lined up right
[4:10] it's perfect but a lot of times that
[4:13] don't look perfect now man was created
[4:17] on what day six-day get if you read
[4:23] right above all right looks like he's
[4:24] created on the Sabbath and God blessed
[4:32] the seventh day and sanctified it unless
[4:33] there's works from the things but it's
[4:36] not see so don't get that in your mind
[4:39] say well it says seventh right third huh
[4:41] because that's what it says here these
[4:44] are the generations now he's explaining
[4:46] the whole makeup of creation he's not
[4:51] going day 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 see if you
[4:54] look at it that way it makes the Bible a
[4:56] whole lot more enjoyable all right in
[5:00] every plant of the field before it was
[5:03] in the earth and never herb of the field
[5:05] before a group for the Lord God had not
[5:08] caused it to rain upon the earth and
[5:12] there was not a man to till the ground
[5:16] but that went out of mist from the earth
[5:18] and watered the whole face of the ground
[5:23] and the Lord God formed man out of the
[5:26] dust of the ground and breathed into his
[5:29] nostrils the breath of life and he
[5:31] became a living soul you may be seated
[5:35] we'll get to Hebrews 11 in a little bit
[5:37] well go ahead I'll just read it for you
[5:40] know what it is God having provided some
[5:42] better thing for us that they without us
[5:45] should not be made perfect all right now
[5:49] as I said it's going to be a very odd
[5:53] way and that's my ways I attempted to
[5:58] preach on there some I mean the layout
[6:02] some year two ago when it didn't seem to
[6:07] seem to line up you know so you wait
[6:11] until you find out and everything and
[6:14] you find out well you know like sister
[6:17] Frieda said it needed to wait for her so
[6:19] okay that's all right but see when you
[6:24] we take something and you read it and
[6:27] you're looking for God to speak to you
[6:33] about the word and how perfect it is and
[6:35] if you will he'll speak to you he'll
[6:37] show you like I said it looks exactly
[6:40] like they're in the creation because it
[6:43] doesn't say man was created on the sixth
[6:46] day it looks like he was created on the
[6:49] seventh day see you say well I can prove
[6:51] it by the Bible no because when you get
[6:55] over to there then we read it and said
[6:59] and there was no man to tell us all
[7:02] you're already into the creation of all
[7:06] the things so don't get discouraged when
[7:11] you things don't match up the way you
[7:14] think okay best thing to do is just set
[7:19] it aside if that don't set up real good
[7:22] just set it aside and just pray and
[7:25] every once in a while go get that and
[7:28] read it you know and read it and you'll
[7:31] see then one day it'll all just come
[7:34] into view and God will perfectly line it
[7:37] up all right
[7:39] now here's my point I've been asking you
[7:44] the question for quite a while it's like
[7:46] I said months ago but mainly in the
[7:49] series asking you the question of what
[7:53] does it mean when it says there that
[7:57] they without us should not be made
[8:00] perfect we go in and spend our time
[8:08] trying to decide whether the creation
[8:11] was this or the creation was that order
[8:13] there you know or we go into the
[8:16] want to try to figure out how we got to
[8:17] here whatever and figured out all all
[8:20] this well and done but the question is
[8:26] still why does it say it now you got to
[8:32] admit that it means what it says and
[8:36] says what it means and without a profit
[8:39] then to give us the definition look
[8:43] where we would be okay now but to say
[8:48] they without us cannot be made perfect
[8:50] now here's the key if you'll listen okay
[8:54] everybody why would now what we've got
[8:58] to deal with to get an understanding and
[9:03] a lineup and I don't care I'll finish it
[9:04] Sunday and the next Sunday weights gonna
[9:06] be gone I'll have to then I ain't
[9:09] concerned about it but listen in Bible
[9:16] terminologies now if you can ever find
[9:20] something that was in existence it can
[9:24] be replaced again or whatever you want
[9:28] to call it renewed whatever you want to
[9:31] call the terminologies work all right
[9:34] now then why would it say they without
[9:37] us it seems to put a great emphasis upon
[9:42] the people and we know according to the
[9:45] Prophet that really the emphasis is
[9:47] placed upon the end time all right now
[9:52] I've been reading those things and
[9:53] saying them and it's dependent upon me
[9:56] and you and there's a reason for that
[10:00] it's very valuable and terminologies of
[10:04] the Bible and it's laid out so perfectly
[10:08] until it's sealed away from the eyes of
[10:11] the wise and prudent but reveal the
[10:12] babes such as we'll learn and if they
[10:15] you know
[10:18] but do you realize this whole thing came
[10:25] into being because God had a plan and a
[10:30] purpose is that the best way to state it
[10:32] and get started right on Christ revealed
[10:37] and I was not into flavors
[10:39] anyhow God had a plan and a purpose that
[10:46] he was going to achieve alright now this
[10:53] is one statement I like of myself I'll
[10:56] make it because you'll probably maybe
[10:57] find it in bread around somewhere but
[10:59] I'm making this as myself so this is a
[11:01] quote from brother Dale that if I can
[11:07] find something in the Bible I can depend
[11:13] upon that you know and I don't look at
[11:18] it like it was back there or over there
[11:21] or later I look at it as the present
[11:24] tense because remember I've always tried
[11:26] to preach it that away I always tried to
[11:29] preach the fact I was trying to get you
[11:31] to see present tense right now I am
[11:34] means ever-present for eternity right so
[11:40] then now here's the statement whatever
[11:44] the way that God started he cannot
[11:50] change from that way now the Prophet
[11:58] said there could be greater revelation
[12:00] to added or more to think what you said
[12:02] you can't add to the word but he said as
[12:04] time goes along things could develop a
[12:07] little you know but it won't add to the
[12:09] word so if you can ever find in the word
[12:13] what your point is then you can see hey
[12:20] maybe that's the way God wants it well I
[12:25] I just quoted it the Prophet said
[12:29] that God had a plan and a purpose
[12:33] that he was going to achieve alright now
[12:39] what we do cannot stop that plan and
[12:46] purpose a pretty good in road or an
[12:50] attack happened in the garden right when
[12:57] Adam and Eve but it didn't change God's
[13:01] plan you never looked down and said wait
[13:04] a minute now they they done that so I've
[13:06] got to change my way he knew that that
[13:09] was the way they were going to do it and
[13:13] he knew exactly what he was going to do
[13:15] that he wasn't gonna have to prop it up
[13:18] and and and do anything that he was
[13:21] going to just let them live out their
[13:23] lives and then he would just step on the
[13:28] scene because remember now as we cover
[13:31] with the Prophet and been at it many
[13:32] many years of what God doesn't a
[13:36] creation has no beginning I mean a new
[13:39] creation has no beginning and no ending
[13:42] so you'd have to start anything back in
[13:44] eternal life right or back before the
[13:48] foundation of the world so that'd be the
[13:49] best way of saying back in eternity so
[13:52] god back in eternity had a plan and a
[13:56] purpose and he was going to see that
[14:01] achieve now we thank Adam and he throwed
[14:07] him a great big block or a great
[14:10] stumbling block to create two problems I
[14:16] wish I'd have brought it earlier when I
[14:18] was looking at it to other day we wrote
[14:20] around him he's talking about you and I
[14:22] and he said don't you worry about it
[14:25] he said God knew exactly what was gonna
[14:28] do something to that degree see he knew
[14:32] exactly what we were going to do so why
[14:36] didn't he run in and you know kill them
[14:41] the day of Olin eye
[14:43] all of the things and he'd wind up with
[14:50] Adam right
[14:55] that would be worried wound up you see
[14:58] in me he'd wind up without him him and
[15:01] Adam was still been in the garden but he
[15:05] didn't deliberately make Adam and Eve do
[15:09] wrong he made them perfect now you tell
[15:19] me he didn't then we might as well just
[15:21] yet and go home because I'm not gonna
[15:24] talk to you in that line he made
[15:26] everything perfect he might not have
[15:29] made it eternal in the beginning but he
[15:34] made it perfect all right
[15:37] and God always has used examples all the
[15:42] Old Testament an example of the New
[15:45] Testament all right then brother branham
[15:51] said on the missions of serpent seed
[15:54] he's talking about the creation and he
[15:56] said that pure pure P you are a
[16:01] beginning it's not about the making of
[16:07] mankind and making you know he said that
[16:09] pure beginning now listen do you believe
[16:14] that God got a wedge thrown at him or
[16:19] had problems doing that or do you
[16:22] believe he was just sitting back waiting
[16:24] on everything to take place we think he
[16:32] went on vacation you know we use that
[16:35] statement as a point that he's not
[16:36] around but I don't think so I think he
[16:44] was are so close until he'd be well what
[16:51] I'm saying now I'm trying to get
[16:52] something to you as a thought of why it
[16:55] says
[16:56] they without us cannot be made perfect
[17:00] Adam was created perfect do you agree
[17:04] because God can't create something
[17:06] imperfect the devil wasn't created
[17:09] imperfect he was anointed cherubim stood
[17:12] beside the Lord he could not be created
[17:16] something imperfect I can't do that
[17:20] I forgive me to have to take a coffee up
[17:23] or something because every time I turn
[17:28] around today he's trying his best to
[17:30] work me over and I just laugh and say my
[17:34] standing I want to go this life and
[17:37] we'll devil we'll just get through this
[17:42] they don't matter
[17:43] you know you come on do what you want to
[17:46] you say well that's a poor example of a
[17:48] Christian you're supposed to be positive
[17:50] I'm positive
[17:51] but what about you right I'm very
[17:57] positive because see what I'm looking at
[17:59] let me tell you in one nutshell let me
[18:03] just say this is what will answer the
[18:06] question Oh without us they cannot be
[18:10] made perfect so whatever he created had
[18:13] to create it perfect now that's the key
[18:17] to the whole thing he had to create it
[18:21] perfect he couldn't created it imperfect
[18:23] and then made it perfect but he can
[18:27] because he allows in his great mind and
[18:30] existence that as things goes along he
[18:33] can come to positions that he can take
[18:36] that which is not perfect and make it
[18:39] perfect he could do that that's alright
[18:43] but just remember he won't change his
[18:45] word if he wanted to be a healer how is
[18:51] he going to get something to heal if he
[18:57] wanted to be a savior how was he going
[18:59] to get something to say right
[19:04] so then he figures out his planning
[19:08] purpose and he starts it off perfect but
[19:13] you know it's kind of odd that the first
[19:18] creation of God was a man named Adam all
[19:26] right I was looking in our minute ago
[19:29] just trying to pick it up but somewhere
[19:31] brother run says like he's he said Adam
[19:33] was God's perfect son I found a couple
[19:37] of others but that's alright listen
[19:43] looking at Adam now what does the Bible
[19:48] call him it calls him the first Adam 2nd
[19:55] Corinthians or something in there I've
[19:57] got the notes ok Jesus Christ is the
[20:02] first Adam second uh come on stay with
[20:09] me though listen see because your
[20:14] Creator was before the world there's
[20:18] your real first Adam now I'm just kind
[20:22] of get you to play with me a little bit
[20:24] and think about something maybe give you
[20:28] something to ponder for days so then we
[20:33] see it as you said when you come on over
[20:35] all right Adam is the first Adam okay
[20:38] that's natural but why does it say that
[20:44] Adam was flesh and it says which came
[20:49] first that that was physical or that
[20:53] that was spiritual and Corinthians he
[20:55] said that that was physical came first
[20:59] then that which was spiritual came later
[21:04] because he God was going he couldn't put
[21:07] Adam in the garden as a total perfect
[21:12] being
[21:15] you're listening he couldn't put in
[21:19] there as a total perfect being God how
[21:22] would he have got to be a savior
[21:26] how would he got to be a healer you
[21:30] realize that the fall didn't them didn't
[21:32] pulling us no wrong God it just made God
[21:36] a way to fulfill his original plan now
[21:45] when you can look back and drive that
[21:47] anchor down and you extend our look at
[21:52] it that was the most marvelous creation
[21:57] in the world God's own son that was his
[22:08] first son Jesus was his first begotten
[22:12] that was his first son don't you think
[22:19] that he would put in and design or
[22:23] whatever it is that with all in mind
[22:28] that every son he had he wanted it like
[22:34] that be careful God put into Adam what
[22:49] he wanted he brought him exactly the way
[22:52] he wanted him he wanted him that away
[22:55] and he brought him that away and let me
[22:58] tell you for we even get started that's
[23:00] the way it's going to wind up if it
[23:03] don't wind up that way we're all going
[23:05] to get old and go to the nursing homes
[23:08] and blur out here and wait until death
[23:12] takes us well we've been at it for 50
[23:16] years and they don't and that's what I'm
[23:18] telling you what I'm telling you and I
[23:22] don't back off I was preaching this here
[23:25] 40 years ago right here in this church
[23:29] trying to get to why do you think I
[23:32] don't go anywhere
[23:33] go see nobody wants to know what I'm
[23:35] talking about right they love me that's
[23:42] present but tell me if I hadn't preached
[23:47] in on these brothers in churches when
[23:48] they've ever won priest in this one I'm
[23:54] not throwing no songs I like it that way
[23:58] it's made me left alone it I don't have
[24:00] to argue with nobody I don't have to be
[24:04] put into no camp
[24:05] here's know you ain't wrong old enough
[24:07] but sister cleda and Larry and a few of
[24:10] them like that can remember when they'd
[24:15] say who do you follow long about - 68 69
[24:20] 70 what group are you in I just say I'm
[24:27] in the bride and I am kidding you I've
[24:33] been preaching that Jesus Christ was
[24:36] all-in-all Almighty God and that his
[24:39] laid out in the word his example for us
[24:43] to follow to come to the place to where
[24:45] he's at alright so there you see Adam
[24:57] created and God's original plan now I'll
[25:04] keep saying this cuz it's back to you
[25:06] it's not me I want you to know it's I'm
[25:09] putting it back to you do you believe
[25:12] that Adams plan was
[25:14] I mean God's plan was to bring Adam
[25:17] forth if you don't we need to just have
[25:21] a prayer line and pray for everybody no
[25:25] joke if you don't believe that God knew
[25:31] what he was going to do you need to go
[25:34] back to a good Baptist Church cuz they
[25:37] taught some of that
[25:41] and probably still do but what is it
[25:47] about Adam Adam is to be God's total
[25:51] original plan the everything that God
[25:56] wants he put it into Adam you said he
[26:03] wanted to fall come on how long do I got
[26:06] to preach on it for you to realize your
[26:08] profits when it said yes I did
[26:10] he said Satan didn't pull a thing over
[26:13] on God he helped him fulfill his plan
[26:18] right all right now so whatever you have
[26:25] in the original is the example right I
[26:32] mean you don't you don't start making a
[26:36] car and then you you get over the middle
[26:38] of it you know and I ain't making card
[26:40] I'm just talking you keep the original
[26:42] plan as long as it's selling then you
[26:44] might change over but what I'm getting
[26:48] at car had corn brakes right
[26:54] stirring wheel every one of them it may
[26:57] look entirely different but it's a car
[27:01] right see whatever you get put it down
[27:07] and spanker that now what I'm saying
[27:09] I'll keep saying that tonight anchor
[27:11] this point whatever God wanted Adam was
[27:17] ready but he got hindered what did that
[27:26] hinder God whoever did the garden you
[27:30] see what he's gonna do right so then
[27:37] think about it was Adam created eternal
[27:43] I know we've had a lot of problem trying
[27:47] to explain this long time ago and it's
[27:48] been there and I don't worry about it
[27:49] I've tried yet
[27:54] I'm gonna say it but I'm gonna back up
[27:58] Adam had eternal life in his soul will
[28:03] read that in a minute but his body and
[28:08] his spirit was not eternal
[28:24] now is that what God wants not stay that
[28:31] way but it evidently satisfies him for
[28:33] what he done because he took it and used
[28:36] it get my point to what we look for
[28:42] somewhere to begin this look at that
[28:45] point and see what that point really is
[28:48] and that point was a man that was a body
[28:52] a spirit and a soul but that wouldn't
[29:03] have been no good and just leave it like
[29:05] that so God would not have created it
[29:09] like that he didn't create Adam lost he
[29:13] didn't create a vlogs come on I've been
[29:16] through this way if you didn't agree
[29:18] with him he probably won't again but
[29:20] don't worry about it
[29:22] little random said Adam had eternal life
[29:25] so he said especially in to Adam and he
[29:34] said Eve was in Adam in theophany Hebrew
[29:41] series come on I'm on page 80 of the old
[29:44] book so what looks like what I'm getting
[29:51] that looks like when God started this
[29:53] see what it is said that Adam s that's
[29:57] who I want man
[29:58] I won't add him but I'm going to
[30:00] creating perfect he says I'm gonna give
[30:06] him eternal life I'm gonna put him in
[30:08] the garden and I'm gonna give him an
[30:11] eternal body and spirit and leave him in
[30:15] control in the body I mean in the garden
[30:18] oh yeah I've got to I've got to get even
[30:22] there so I'll just put even to Adam
[30:24] because I done made my six days creating
[30:30] right
[30:33] and he says I'll just give him a
[30:35] helpmeet but we know for certain that
[30:45] Adam was created body spirit and so as a
[30:50] natural human being that was God's plan
[30:55] and purpose you say how do you know it
[31:00] took place you wanna fuss
[31:04] I'll just keep saying it back to you it
[31:07] took place
[31:07] did you tell me what your problems are
[31:13] because you're not wanting to agree with
[31:15] the word being Ryan when God created
[31:22] Adam he didn't create him eternal
[31:27] because you can't create eternal so now
[31:34] what was Adam way to hold on here anyway
[31:41] 1:26 and 27 jump into 28 let us make man
[31:52] he made a special man Adams soul was
[32:01] eternal I'll read it to you in a minute
[32:02] okay but he didn't create him eternal
[32:17] he created him as a human being then he
[32:26] took the part that he had from the 1:26
[32:30] and 27 man don't let us and put that man
[32:34] into Adams soul now he's got what he
[32:41] wants he's got a man that can help him
[32:46] fulfill his plans and purposes not to
[32:49] just go up past the garden and plow up
[32:51] stuff and replant no he's got a man that
[32:56] can help him now so he can't never take
[33:03] away that he turn alive and we know we
[33:05] don't anyway right okay that would be
[33:06] settled it he can't take it away so he
[33:11] knows once he gave or made that man that
[33:18] whatever he does from their own would be
[33:20] an example now remember your first
[33:25] beginning creation whatever you only use
[33:28] the terminologies is what you want
[33:34] that's your plan in purpose it was not
[33:39] to for God to create something that was
[33:46] you know
[33:54] that was eternal so what was Adam mail
[34:05] quoted Adam was God in another form
[34:10] called Adam now may I sing get down okay
[34:18] don't don't don't
[34:20] everybody wait okay what are you if you
[34:30] are a child of God you have eternal life
[34:33] in your soul is that eternal life a new
[34:36] creation the Bible calls at that but you
[34:38] know the correcting way of the problem
[34:40] brought it not to correct the Scriptures
[34:42] meaning but he brought it to the truth
[34:49] God began in Adam to impart eternal life
[34:56] not create know he had that plan before
[35:05] the world was listening to him last
[35:10] night and brother Aaron was saying said
[35:11] if you would never back down you never
[35:13] will be back there so okay
[35:15] no we said problems the way we get back
[35:18] are we have all kind of little sayings
[35:20] and things to try to get a start
[35:22] well we've been 50 years trying to get
[35:24] there I think it's time to sit down
[35:29] settle the thing and to see what it is
[35:34] Adams soul was not created eternal he
[35:39] was an impartation of Almighty God into
[35:44] human flesh what are you
[35:53] you're an impartation of eternal life
[35:59] because it doesn't mean it when it said
[36:02] new creations and all like that we get
[36:04] those terms in our minds and we keep
[36:05] running around
[36:06] yeah but the new creation had a
[36:07] beginning the one that I'm talking about
[36:09] had never had no beginning that's what I
[36:15] was talking about it during the Bible
[36:16] study or not about it about Michael see
[36:20] Michael was God in another form call the
[36:24] word that's where Satan could never
[36:30] figure that out
[36:32] Satan was the anointed cherub that stood
[36:36] beside the Lord if anything was going to
[36:39] be done God was going to turn to Satan
[36:42] and say Satan go to this well we need a
[36:47] world created and about that time then
[36:52] it gets to he's visually I've been
[36:54] around now this God for you know for a
[36:57] long time and and I kind of know his
[36:59] vibes and it's doing and what he's
[37:01] getting revved up he's getting involved
[37:03] up so what's he fixing to do about that
[37:08] time out steps a little pillar of fire
[37:10] al oh gosh I'm quoting brother Branham
[37:14] ok and said steps out and says let there
[37:22] be see
[37:27] don't misunderstand what becoming
[37:29] ologies I'm sorry the father never
[37:32] created anything
[37:36] now come on you know what I'm talking
[37:38] about we'll keep it we'll run it down
[37:39] into the right line but who was the
[37:41] creator the son he was before the
[37:45] foundation the world with the father who
[37:49] was he the son not another God not God
[37:54] in another form or whatever that's the
[37:56] best you can do cut less human
[37:58] terminologies that word that was back
[38:01] very the logos the theophany
[38:03] was Almighty God in the form
[38:07] to be used that he could create Satan
[38:13] looks at that and he says I don't
[38:18] understand this guy come where'd he come
[38:19] from
[38:21] right you ever thought like that the
[38:24] devil he starts getting mad he gets all
[38:26] upset where'd this guy come from I'm
[38:29] supposed to be doing the creating I'm
[38:32] supposed to be delivering the word right
[38:41] and we see we must have a pretty good
[38:43] point lined up anyway I like it but see
[38:48] Adam in his creation was body spirit and
[38:51] soul but then God put his life into Adam
[38:57] and made him a living soul eternal life
[39:06] in the soul of Adam we get there he
[39:13] stands his body in spirit Oh get it take
[39:22] you see that new birth that you have is
[39:27] God in another form inside of you call
[39:35] the alive word so God had a plan and a
[39:43] purpose to get itself revealed well what
[39:50] was he going to reveal itself as me you
[39:52] realize if he reveals himself as healer
[39:54] they got to be something sick so he's
[39:58] gonna have to get to happen if you
[39:59] reveal the seven assayer they got to be
[40:01] something lost so all of this happening
[40:05] didn't come forth as a it came forth to
[40:08] manifest itself in the right way
[40:10] now here's my kids listen why does it
[40:16] say they without us
[40:22] now we'll go it tonight I know we won't
[40:24] get through but that's our day without
[40:28] us cannot be made perfect it's not
[40:35] statement so they're depending on us oh
[40:44] no know what that means is they without
[40:47] us that means that the Trinity of God is
[40:49] sitting over here somewhere two or three
[40:51] people floating around time we get all
[40:53] them together we'll have the US is
[40:55] together no I like what Oh Theo Erasmus
[41:00] preached that time we took the name
[41:03] Jesus Jes us he said if it wasn't for us
[41:08] his name would be Jess alright so here
[41:17] we get the man now standing here Briard
[41:22] oh you mean that's what God wants it
[41:29] evidently is because that's what he got
[41:32] right now I've kept emphasizing that you
[41:36] don't stumble around he don't stumble
[41:38] around and find out well I fell I failed
[41:40] somewhere so I got to find some other
[41:42] way now I'll have to run over here and
[41:43] run no no no no he could stand out
[41:46] looking at him and say there's my child
[41:54] there's my part of thee so that I am
[42:04] drilling in a man named Adam we get he
[42:09] left him with a body and a spirit in the
[42:15] world of perfection let's get this right
[42:17] now so we don't play the game of jumping
[42:19] he was put into a world of perfection
[42:21] had he stayed that way everything been
[42:23] alright okay I understand that so don't
[42:26] just jump away but he
[42:32] he said you know that's my example child
[42:37] no no no no no now Jesus was the example
[42:40] job okay I'll go way back for the
[42:46] foundation world Jesus was that word no
[42:50] problem I'll go that way we just won't
[42:52] go that way what you say what I don't
[42:57] understand your brother Dale said you
[42:58] get started on the message and then you
[43:01] just dry up I thought the Prophet said
[43:14] questions made a strong Church oh but
[43:18] the Bible says questions gender strife
[43:25] right that's the Bible so now watch
[43:29] brother I'm talking about he's talking
[43:35] about the same thing that Peter everyone
[43:37] said it unanswered questions is what
[43:41] gender strife not answers on answer to
[43:46] run you know wrong questions
[43:49] it's what gingers just right because you
[43:54] can't put it together because your
[43:55] prophet says that it makes a strong
[43:59] Church why when the church gets the
[44:03] answers not when they get over this
[44:06] brother so until he's preaching that and
[44:08] I like him and I was but I can't
[44:10] understand brother Dale brought you're
[44:11] like oh brother so-and-so so when I get
[44:13] through the night I go home I put him in
[44:14] pop and I said don't listen to him
[44:16] that's your business
[44:17] I didn't start this church off of that
[44:19] and won't end anyway that's your
[44:23] business
[44:23] the only thing I ask you to do give me
[44:29] the opportunity that you give to others
[44:36] you know they say things wrong you know
[44:41] they say things that are wrong
[44:43] what do you do with there wrong he said
[44:46] well brother Dale I can't find you wrong
[44:52] okay that's off the plate
[45:00] what do you realize and I'll come back
[45:03] through every bit of this because I know
[45:05] it's gonna take it that God in His
[45:15] creation brought his plan and purpose
[45:19] into being and he started it with what
[45:26] he wanted it in today no no no no he
[45:30] wants us in eternity come on you got
[45:34] enough sense and followed me long enough
[45:35] to know don't stumble off on silly stuff
[45:38] listen God started with a man his name
[45:46] was Adam he had a body that was not
[45:51] eternal because there was no way the
[45:54] fall could have come if his body it had
[45:56] have been eternal he had a spirit that
[46:00] was not eternal there's no way for the
[46:03] fall to come
[46:04] had there been a spirit that had not
[46:07] fallen you mean that's what he won't
[46:20] he wants a man that'll believe that God
[46:28] and come to that place Jesus Christ came
[46:39] to that place right see Jesus's body
[46:48] wasn't eternal Jesus his spirit wasn't
[46:53] he Tom it was his soul that was eternal
[46:58] okay
[47:01] am i right
[47:03] at least not holler screamer do
[47:06] something if it's right it's right do
[47:15] you see when the fifth when the point of
[47:18] the creation came on through we'll
[47:20] follow it coming through
[47:22] Enoch that was not will follow those
[47:27] signs will come to Elijah that was take
[47:31] another will come through all of those
[47:35] to show you God can be working there but
[47:39] there's always a reason that they could
[47:43] not reach what he wanted him to reach
[47:47] Jesus Christ walked on earth as a man
[47:51] right soul eternal because he was an
[47:58] impartation of eternal life he was not a
[48:04] second son that was when God stepped in
[48:10] to his son or his soul the word the
[48:14] being hmm that's when you got one guard
[48:19] outside that's you don't have it you
[48:20] still tighter than you trinitarianism
[48:22] and in your life at least I don't
[48:24] understand what he means me said
[48:25] trinitarianism
[48:30] but you see what's the point
[48:37] Adam was God's original plan and the way
[48:43] he wanted all to come was first made
[48:47] manifest in Adam come on I mean we we
[48:58] stay only here for a while
[49:01] Adam was God an original plan to take
[49:05] care
[49:05] but Jesus was God's own son which is not
[49:09] a son but God in another form called a
[49:12] son right this is my beloved Son in whom
[49:19] I'm pleased to dwell so you see what I'm
[49:24] getting at now and you'll you'll catch
[49:26] it and we'll go for a little bit and
[49:28] stop see then whatever God started with
[49:36] he's gonna have to finish with that or
[49:41] else he'll change his mind somewhere
[49:43] along the way and if you believe that
[49:47] tell you I don't so that's all right I
[49:50] have no control over you my family left
[49:53] they've got to make their own decisions
[49:55] they've got to have their own Holy Ghost
[49:56] they got to be their own people a wife
[50:00] is saying see it was not an atom of
[50:13] creation now listen carefully
[50:16] of eternal life that was his body his
[50:21] spirit it was the impartation into him
[50:29] of the Genesis 1:26 and 27 men would
[50:32] have said let us make man there he stood
[50:36] and brother branham said Eve was in Adam
[50:39] so we want to beat Eve too
[50:41] yes about everything why didn't God
[50:49] while she was dr. doing all that thing
[50:51] why didn't he just get him something
[50:52] just go we'll take care of that and I'll
[50:56] get another one
[50:57] lay down Adam will we get another rib
[51:00] not making a joke it's true he had to do
[51:04] something no what happened he just
[51:09] turned his head we couldn't see I'll be
[51:17] back when it's time I'll be back
[51:22] it'll take me six thousand years to get
[51:25] back but I'll have many examples all the
[51:29] way through of this one example that I'm
[51:32] given but now here's the catch to the
[51:36] story Enoch walked off the earth true
[51:44] nobody in the Old Testament had an
[51:46] eternal soul you said well that it was
[51:49] no that's the one that was a beginning
[51:50] career all beginning all new beginning
[51:52] creation starts with a full-grown
[51:55] potential day of Pentecost when the Holy
[51:58] Ghost was fully come it had to have a
[52:00] certain amount of doing when anything
[52:02] like that it's got to have that to be be
[52:04] right and when it does then he stands
[52:14] and looks at his own child and you
[52:20] remember a child of God is not another
[52:21] God he's just God imparted I like the
[52:25] way brother molt used to try to explain
[52:27] he turned a lot he said you think you've
[52:29] got eternal life straight said this is
[52:31] where it sounds to me said you take this
[52:33] big ol Apple and said you whack it up
[52:36] and you give it out in pieces that's the
[52:39] way you've got your doctrine he said I
[52:42] just remember one thing
[52:43] when you run out of pieces you run out
[52:46] of God right once you give away them
[52:51] pieces it's all gone
[52:52] but God ain't that away
[52:54] more God gives out the greater he is the
[53:01] greater is the more he could pass out of
[53:05] himself but listen I'm gonna say this
[53:10] and then leave it that's why this age is
[53:14] here to finish up God's original plan
[53:17] and everything from Darr back was
[53:22] waiting on something to happen a bride a
[53:33] bride
[53:36] Adam had worn at fight over the Old
[53:43] Testament had won at failure I was
[53:46] listening to prophet two other day and
[53:47] you could take it straighten out all
[53:48] these thoughts and ideas people got and
[53:50] he said Adams bride didn't fall what are
[54:01] you saying
[54:02] boy it took a while the scepter and
[54:05] think oh he done told him he said
[54:08] because she wasn't in the original part
[54:10] of it so that's why she couldn't match
[54:14] nothing to put it back come on you'll
[54:20] find out when he days what serpent seed
[54:21] means okay Adam was God's original plan
[54:31] that he wanted to come forward he
[54:35] started that out with a man that was
[54:38] body spirit and soul the soul was
[54:45] eternal the body was in a time element
[54:48] he could be beaten he could beat all
[54:49] things his spirit was in a another world
[54:54] but yet he could be tempted in that
[54:58] spirit huh
[55:00] but that's so you couldn't touch it
[55:08] when a bride comes back on earth again
[55:11] that they can say I and my father are
[55:13] one
[55:14] let me quote the rest of it and these
[55:17] other things the Prophet said it'll all
[55:21] be over when you see that man that was
[55:28] back Gaara come all the way through and
[55:33] can bring him into being let him do his
[55:38] works and then bring him into being in
[55:41] this day you'll see God's plan let's see
[55:50] just think about it now let me finish up
[55:52] the message we I'll try to finish the
[55:55] part of God then walls when he gave you
[56:04] the new birth that was his plan but he
[56:11] wants our body and our spirit to come to
[56:13] that position I mean everybody ought to
[56:15] know that we'll follow that line what
[56:19] see the only way we can do that is to
[56:21] follow God in his ways and see what he's
[56:25] talking about where he's going what he's
[56:27] leading our soul is made eternal by the
[56:33] new birth but we are waiting the
[56:37] redemption of the body so now in reverse
[56:47] order when you can find it and you take
[56:51] this man and you bring him down through
[56:55] time and he bring him in to the New
[56:58] Testament and he's the second Adam
[57:03] he's got the original plan and what he's
[57:08] gonna do is wait till that can be made
[57:10] manifest it's already here
[57:14] you realize that a brown said the
[57:17] baptism of Holy Ghost you have is the
[57:18] same Holy Ghost that was on the shores
[57:22] of Galilee same Holy Ghost it created
[57:24] and all of these things when are we
[57:27] gonna realize that that he's in our soul
[57:33] yes but brother Taylor I can do that it
[57:35] if we didn't have any trouble now you're
[57:37] out of the Bible
[57:38] okay solve that don't come to me and say
[57:42] nothing like that cause you're out of
[57:43] the Bible
[57:50] see Satan in the garden he looked at
[57:56] Adam he said that guy created him it
[58:08] looks pretty good then all that was here
[58:12] steps into another and then to be and he
[58:14] said oh that's just bride his wife he
[58:17] done a good job that couldn't probably
[58:20] done much better than that himself
[58:21] cuz he yeah that's what he wanted he
[58:23] wanted that thing all right hand man I'm
[58:25] illustrating that period to get you to
[58:28] see it he don't want to be I have never
[58:30] met a boss of any where I worked that
[58:36] wanted to be in charge he wants the vice
[58:38] president to be in charge but him get
[58:40] all the Pat's on the back right but see
[58:53] then follow this life statement when
[58:57] this Mex are circling comes back to here
[59:01] you'll find that everybody in between
[59:04] there one way or the other was connected
[59:16] one way or other everybody was connected
[59:19] on the day of Pentecost what did you
[59:21] have you had the bride of Jesus Christ
[59:24] with eternal life in their soul their
[59:29] body and spirit was still in time you
[59:33] had the great Apostle Paul and he was
[59:39] looking around that day when he said it
[59:41] he said they without us could not be
[59:42] made perfect in other words he plainly
[59:44] saying to them hey do you realize I'm
[59:47] talking to you without something to
[59:52] happen without something to take place
[59:53] without the message that God has given
[59:56] me to bring to you you can never achieve
[59:58] what you're wanting
[1:00:02] they just glory hallelujah this happy in
[1:00:08] do you finally counted it easier than
[1:00:10] others I just leave you alone they
[1:00:17] without us in other words they that
[1:00:20] started
[1:00:21] if one form and the us that we are is
[1:00:27] one form called the body and they're not
[1:00:32] perfect until we receive but one said
[1:00:35] the Old Testament not perfect without
[1:00:36] the new but he said now the New
[1:00:38] Testament is not perfect without the old
[1:00:40] right all right because that's what it's
[1:00:44] got to be what do you follow me just
[1:00:50] think about this until we get back only
[1:00:58] see Paul was standing there it's gonna
[1:01:05] hurt I got on the notes I see what I'm
[1:01:08] gonna say it anyway Paul was standing
[1:01:12] there at a place because of his new
[1:01:16] birth and his adoption in these
[1:01:18] teachings in time that Adam had lost you
[1:01:26] agree with
[1:01:28] you don't what did he do see he goes
[1:01:32] about trying his best to get everybody
[1:01:35] to that place of his message they're
[1:01:40] trying their best to get out the message
[1:01:45] when you see Adams standing on the earth
[1:01:48] again in the right way and I've just
[1:01:52] preached it to you so there it is what
[1:01:54] is Adams standing on earth in the right
[1:01:55] way
[1:01:56] soul eternal body not eternal spirit not
[1:02:04] eternal so we've got to have the
[1:02:07] adoptions of the the different things
[1:02:11] and see I'm going to put it this way
[1:02:13] what about when Enoch walked off the
[1:02:15] earth well boy he just he just had so
[1:02:20] much of God hey man hey man I don't
[1:02:23] misunderstand me
[1:02:24] but he never had any Turner life in his
[1:02:26] soul he said oh yes he did now show me
[1:02:30] where it's at
[1:02:33] when Elijah flew off in the chariots was
[1:02:36] it the Holy Ghost in his soul that took
[1:02:38] him or the anointing that was on him and
[1:02:46] it was the anointing on Enoch see the
[1:02:54] answer lays within the word when we
[1:02:57] return back to the original faith and
[1:02:59] the father's not just playing and
[1:03:03] talking about it would actually be in
[1:03:05] that then God can come on the scene and
[1:03:10] do sometimes the upholstery I try that
[1:03:16] day and he said now your Old Testament
[1:03:19] people said without us you can't be made
[1:03:25] perfect but like brother dick says one
[1:03:28] day he turned around and he was to us
[1:03:29] and he was in the grave that's all right
[1:03:31] but he set a stage don't forget this
[1:03:36] Adams center stage in the garden of what
[1:03:39] God wants this day
[1:03:41] a people that'll do like Abraham and
[1:03:48] believe the word and doubt their doubts
[1:03:53] and get away from there
[1:03:54] flim flam's and ideas and opinions and
[1:03:58] things get down to the word the Prophet
[1:04:02] said to bright he was coming after a
[1:04:03] word born bride
[1:04:07] he said Christ ministry would have to be
[1:04:09] in the church before the rapture well I
[1:04:14] don't believe that okay you're doubting
[1:04:15] the Prophet sorry you're doubting the
[1:04:20] Prophet you could at least say what he
[1:04:22] said
[1:04:27] I just don't believe it I don't see it
[1:04:30] you believe to see or see to believe
[1:04:33] which was in come on musicians I've
[1:04:39] reached a place that I believe is what I
[1:04:41] need for you to think about Adam was
[1:04:46] God's example child God wants every one
[1:04:50] of his children to be like Adam now he
[1:04:54] wants to be like Jesus well don't get
[1:04:59] all exalted in her setup he wants them
[1:05:02] to be like what he's made herself in
[1:05:05] Adam
[1:05:05] he gave Adam eternal life why did Paul
[1:05:10] say Christ in you the hope of glory cuz
[1:05:14] that's what it is the eternal life is
[1:05:18] not just a game or playing eternal life
[1:05:22] is the Word of God revealed to us what
[1:05:26] about it let's stand together brother
[1:05:31] Branham in the message called a serpent
[1:05:33] seed he said the Bible said that Adam
[1:05:35] was the son of God that pure beginning
[1:05:39] batdari Adam was God's Son that perfect
[1:05:48] beginning pure being
[1:05:51] why didn't let me ask you a question
[1:05:53] while you're thinking why did God make
[1:05:58] Adam just whammo body spirit and soul
[1:06:00] eternal he said well with no way to God
[1:06:07] oh now you got it you got it you know
[1:06:11] that God was going to allow that to
[1:06:12] happen
[1:06:13] there was no way for it to come forth if
[1:06:15] he stayed in that perfect position
[1:06:18] complete position and see you've see God
[1:06:24] coming down through his next step is
[1:06:27] Enoch ain't just flies off but he's
[1:06:34] waiting on us
[1:06:36] okay the next one he's Elijah he's
[1:06:42] waiting on us well why is he waiting on
[1:06:45] us to become that man right there right
[1:06:50] here well I just don't see that can
[1:06:53] never be doing you're a doubter
[1:06:55] forgive me you're a doubter well I don't
[1:06:59] see it done I just don't feel it why

[1:11:33] Jesus let me say this in the notes of
[1:11:40] carnal illustration I talked to brother
[1:11:43] Dean Gideon brother Harrison him about
[1:11:45] it because it kind of interested me
[1:11:46] about karate and this was their
[1:11:50] definition in karate
[1:11:52] you got a mentor a God that teaches you
[1:11:56] on but as you train in the karate you
[1:12:01] bind an oath of yourself that you never
[1:12:05] fight your mentor now you know that
[1:12:08] ain't kept you know better than that I'm
[1:12:11] just saying the the rules of coming in
[1:12:13] your binding never to fight your mentor
[1:12:16] you bow out because he taught you what
[1:12:22] you know but I also know this that they
[1:12:27] didn't know
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] a real true karate never tells you all
[1:12:33] he knows he's always got a little
[1:12:38] something a real true preacher don't
[1:12:42] always tell you everything he knows he's
[1:12:46] got some little things along the way
[1:12:48] that might appear so watch them you
[1:12:52] might see it as it appears among us
[1:12:56] because it is God and we believe it
[1:13:00] you're just me it's pray one for another
[1:13:03] [Music]
