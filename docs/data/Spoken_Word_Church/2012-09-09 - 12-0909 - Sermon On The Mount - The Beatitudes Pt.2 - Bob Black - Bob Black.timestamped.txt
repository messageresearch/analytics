[0:00] morning
[0:05] how's everybody doing wonderful
[0:08] good to be alive and back in that home
[0:12] yesterday yeah we did yeah amen I'm
[0:15] proud to give brother away to break
[0:16] after that good job
[0:20] they work hard yes they did and drove
[0:23] back and forth we didn't have a show
[0:24] first
[0:29] you had off
[0:31] that's your shelter then he had he
[0:35] volunteers
[0:37] I can't hear that I can't hear it what's
[0:42] it saying
[0:47] all right we're all Matthew 5 chapter
[0:50] five we're looking at the beginning
[0:57] Matthew chapter five
[1:02] let it come from around here
[1:06] Matthew 5. fine
[1:13] so last time we stopped at the first
[1:16] beatitude blessed are the poor in the
[1:18] spirit and we were talking about how
[1:21] Jesus this parallels um
[1:23] how Moses
[1:25] went up the mountain to get the
[1:27] Commandments in the Old Testament now
[1:29] that here in the New Testament Jesus
[1:31] goes up the mountain to deliver
[1:34] to make to magnify the law to deliver
[1:37] the Commandments to enter into a new
[1:39] kingdom and to and to set forth the
[1:42] character of the people that are going
[1:44] to be in the New Kingdom amen and I will
[1:47] act and uh this is just um as we go
[1:51] through the Beatitudes it's just kind of
[1:53] a mirror for her to look into and
[1:54] reflect back how our lives should be and
[1:57] examine our own selves and see if we
[1:59] measure up that gives us a
[2:04] it gives us kind of a measuring to how
[2:07] to enter into the kingdom
[2:09] so we um
[2:12] let's see let's go ahead and read from
[2:15] starting in verse one and seeing the
[2:17] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[2:19] and when he was sick his disciples came
[2:22] unto him
[2:23] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[2:25] saying and we last time we mentioned out
[2:28] people came from the East and West up to
[2:31] this mountain where the Commandments
[2:32] were delivered and he opened his mouth
[2:34] because the spoken word is the Original
[2:36] Seed and he was delivering his word for
[2:39] them to make to teach them how to enter
[2:42] into the Kingdom so that his word could
[2:44] be made manifest in their lives
[2:46] I mean he's saying further on the
[2:48] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that was
[2:50] back in chapter four The Kingdom of
[2:52] Heaven is repent for the Kingdom of
[2:54] Heaven is at hand the Kingdom of Heaven
[2:55] is the king of first the kingdom that
[2:57] will be in you because if you are part
[3:00] of the Kingdom by receiving the new
[3:01] birth
[3:02] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand because
[3:05] he was about to uh
[3:07] give his life for us so that we could be
[3:10] partakers in chapter act in the second
[3:12] chapter of acts so that we should enter
[3:14] into that Kingdom
[3:16] and all of these blessings are are
[3:19] paradoxes because
[3:21] to the world to the Natural Eye how can
[3:23] you be blessed if you're poor in spirit
[3:25] how can you be blessed if you're
[3:26] Mourning
[3:27] but to the spiritual when you become
[3:31] part of this Kingdom these things become
[3:33] a blessing to me
[3:37] so let's let's see we kind of finished
[3:40] on
[3:42] a foreign spirit
[3:45] that's interesting that just like in
[3:47] Revelation when Jesus
[3:49] speaking to the churches
[3:52] he doesn't start with any kind of
[3:54] condemnation but he starts with a
[3:56] blessing right blessed are the poor in
[3:58] spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of
[4:00] Heaven and the poor and spirit are those
[4:03] that come to a revelation that they are
[4:06] nothing that they uh there's no way in
[4:09] themselves that they can reach the
[4:11] righteousness that God requires right
[4:14] that they're hungry they begin by a
[4:17] revelation that God gives them calling
[4:19] it the other night bible study we were
[4:21] each of us kind of got to give a chance
[4:23] to give a little testimony of how God
[4:26] first started calling us
[4:28] and when God calls you you know you go
[4:31] through uh maybe go to church for a
[4:34] while and
[4:35] um hear the word but then there comes a
[4:37] point in your time in your life when God
[4:39] kisses a hold of you and starts pulling
[4:41] at your heartstrings and your your life
[4:43] you maybe you'll be going down the wrong
[4:46] path but all of a sudden when that
[4:47] happens right when God gives you a
[4:49] revelation
[4:50] of
[4:52] that you are poor in spirit then the
[4:54] direction of your life changes that's
[4:56] right
[4:58] when it's really something that only
[5:00] only God can do that um to give you that
[5:05] realization that there's nothing in
[5:07] yourself that will ever be able to
[5:10] um to meet the righteousness that God
[5:12] requires
[5:16] in Psalm 51 I'll just read this Psalm 51
[5:19] 16 17.
[5:22] um it says for thou desire it's not
[5:24] sacrifice
[5:26] else would I give it thou Delight is not
[5:28] and burn offering
[5:29] we talk about this a lot on the last
[5:31] time the sacrifices of God are our
[5:33] broken Spirit are broken and a contrite
[5:35] heart of God that ought not spies we
[5:38] know David was a man after God's Own
[5:39] Heart and David knew that the approach
[5:41] to God was
[5:42] um was through a right right attitude
[5:45] the right motives and objectives to do
[5:47] what God requires not just because the
[5:51] list of Commandments required in the
[5:53] list of things to do to come to church
[5:55] but because we have a motive to get into
[5:58] fellowship with God and look Beyond and
[6:00] sacrifice into the holy of holies and
[6:02] say God help me to get in there where I
[6:04] could fill the ship of God in partake of
[6:06] the
[6:07] um the manner that
[6:09] Ten Commandments of the
[6:12] um
[6:13] Rod that budded a new life
[6:17] and in uh
[6:20] Isaiah 66 1 through 2 he said thus saith
[6:25] the Lord that heaven is my throne and
[6:26] the Earth is my foot still where is the
[6:28] house that you build into me and where's
[6:29] the place of my wrist for all those
[6:31] things after mine the handmade and all
[6:33] those things have been said the Lord but
[6:35] to this man while I look even to him
[6:36] that is poured of a contrite spirit and
[6:39] trimless at my word
[6:42] so the poor and spirit rely on God
[6:46] not on himself not on anything that we
[6:49] can do not only anything that man can do
[6:51] and and uh James chapter 2
[6:55] if y'all want to just fall off
[7:20] now this was written Jane this is
[7:23] written to um
[7:26] to admonish the brothers that
[7:30] that the word is poor Spirit are you but
[7:33] the context is the same because instead
[7:35] of relying on God they began to rely
[7:37] look on people in the church there uh
[7:40] had a lot of money and influence so he
[7:42] said my brother have not the Faith of
[7:44] Our Lord Jesus Christ
[7:46] the Lord Of Glory with respect of
[7:48] persons for if they'll come under your
[7:50] assembly of man with a gold ring and
[7:53] goodly apparel and they're coming also a
[7:55] poor man of ballerina and he have
[7:57] respect to him that we're at the gay
[7:58] clothing and say unto him sit down here
[8:01] in a good place
[8:02] and say to the poor stand now there or
[8:05] sit under my footstool so
[8:08] he's talking about
[8:10] relying having our faith in God not
[8:12] anything that we can do that's uh the
[8:15] poor in spirit
[8:18] um
[8:18] when Jesus in Luke chapter two I'll just
[8:21] kind of talk through this God comes to
[8:24] the
[8:25] poor in the spirit that will believe in
[8:26] Luke Chapter 2 it came to the shepherds
[8:28] in the field that the
[8:30] um
[8:31] that that God knew you would believe him
[8:36] and I um
[8:38] I was just reading through uh John
[8:40] Wesley's testimony of Salvation he might
[8:43] not have ever heard it before but you
[8:45] know uh he thought that he had a
[8:47] relationship with God until he got on
[8:49] that ship and they started rocking to
[8:50] and fro and he was coming to America
[8:53] and he he saw the lives at the moravians
[8:56] lived and he knew something was lacking
[8:59] this is what he said
[9:00] in this refined way of trusting to my
[9:03] own works and my own righteousness
[9:06] I dragged on heavily finding no Comfort
[9:09] or heal there until the time of my
[9:10] leaving leaving England
[9:12] on shipboard however I was again active
[9:14] in outward Works where pleased God of
[9:16] his free Mercy to give me 26 of the
[9:19] Moravian brethren for companions who
[9:21] endeavored to show me a more excellent
[9:23] way
[9:24] but I understood it not at first I was
[9:27] to learn and too wise
[9:30] so that is seeing the foolishness under
[9:32] me and I continued preaching and
[9:34] following after and trusting in that
[9:36] righteousness whereby no flesh can be
[9:39] justified
[9:41] and then he goes on to talk about um he
[9:44] continued to seek the Lord and uh
[9:46] just as I went out open it again on
[9:48] those words Thou Art not far from the
[9:50] kingdom of God in the afternoon I was
[9:52] asked to go to Saint Paul's The Anthem
[9:54] was out of the deep have I called unto
[9:57] thee Oh Lord hear my voice so let that
[9:59] ears consider well the voice of my
[10:01] complaint if not Lord will be extreme to
[10:05] mark but there's none of this oh Lord
[10:06] who may abide it but there is Mercy with
[10:08] thee therefore Thou shalt be feared for
[10:10] Israel trust in the Lord for with the
[10:12] Lord there is Mercy and with him is
[10:14] plenteous redemption and he shall redeem
[10:17] Israel from all his sins
[10:19] so John Wesley came to a place where he
[10:22] knew that his own righteousness his own
[10:25] Works amen would not meet the
[10:27] requirement
[10:29] when brother Brown said in the Seal of
[10:31] God
[10:32] we can get down to a real contract
[10:34] broken Spirit where sin is mix that
[10:37] together and started old-fashioned
[10:39] crying out of a newborn child
[10:41] that's the kind that gets the Holy Ghost
[10:43] that's right no matter whether they're
[10:45] bad Methodist Baptist or Catholic or
[10:47] whatever they are when they get before
[10:48] that offer and cry day and night oh Lord
[10:51] God look at the sins of this city my
[10:53] heart can't rest I can't rest Lord to
[10:55] see these things going on
[10:57] oh God do something
[10:59] and then let's go to Matthew 5.
[11:04] 4
[11:05] blessed are they that more and they
[11:08] shall be comforted
[11:13] and um
[11:15] as we kind of go along you can see a
[11:17] little progression of the Believers walk
[11:19] through these Beatitudes first God
[11:22] reveals to you that you need to be saved
[11:24] that you're poor and spirit and you
[11:25] can't do anything and you begin to mourn
[11:29] no these things think about that message
[11:32] that brother Brown pretty steep calls to
[11:34] the Deep the Deep draws Us by calling us
[11:37] at first growing us up to Faith the
[11:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[11:40] continue to draw us amen through the
[11:42] Christian experience
[11:46] in uh let's go to Second Corinthians
[11:49] chapter 7.
[11:53] we're talking about morning
[12:09] now remember in First Corinthians
[12:12] Paul uh Paul wrote First Corinth is
[12:14] because he got a letter from Apollos and
[12:17] uh Chloe and the saints that correct for
[12:20] us saying there's some things going on
[12:22] here that need to be corrected and uh
[12:25] so he corrected him and now in the
[12:28] second Corinthians
[12:30] let's read what he said
[12:33] let's see verse one where the main point
[12:36] is we're going to get down to verse 10
[12:38] and 11. but just let's just kind of set
[12:41] the stage by reading the whole story
[12:43] having therefore these promises dearly
[12:46] beloved let us lend ourselves from all
[12:48] filthiness of the Flesh and spirit
[12:50] perfecting holiness in the fear of God
[12:53] receive us we have wronged no man we
[12:57] have corrupted no man we have the fraud
[13:00] in new man
[13:01] I speak not this to condemn you
[13:04] for I have said before that you are in
[13:06] our hearts to die and live with you see
[13:09] he's trying to say I'm not I didn't
[13:11] write those things or I'm not writing
[13:13] these things now because that I'm uh I
[13:15] don't like you or anything I want the
[13:17] best for you right
[13:19] the great is my boldness of speech
[13:21] towards you great is my glory of you I'm
[13:24] filled with Comfort I am exceeding
[13:25] joyful in all our tribulation
[13:28] for when we were coming to Macedonia our
[13:31] flesh had no rest but we were troubled
[13:34] on every side without we're fighting
[13:35] within our fears nevertheless God that
[13:37] comforteth those that are cast down
[13:39] comforted Us by the coming of Titus and
[13:43] not by his coming only but by the
[13:45] consolation we're with he was comforted
[13:48] in you when he told us your earnest
[13:50] desire your mourning your fervent mind
[13:53] toward me so that I Rejoice the Lord so
[13:56] he gave him a little uh a little rebuke
[13:59] but it Eternal and we'll see why in a
[14:02] second for though I made you sorry with
[14:04] a letter
[14:05] I do not repent though I did repent
[14:09] for I perceive that the same epistle
[14:12] hath made you sorry though it were but
[14:14] for a season so he may be at first he
[14:17] felt a little bad for his harsh words
[14:18] but then after he saw the effect right
[14:21] he didn't repent now I Rejoice not that
[14:24] you were made sorry but that ye sorrow
[14:27] to repentance you were made sorry after
[14:30] a Godly manner that you might receive
[14:33] damage by us and nothing
[14:35] Godly Soul or worketh repentance to
[14:37] Salvation not to be repented of but the
[14:40] sorrow of the world the work of the Dead
[14:42] Brother
[14:44] so there's two different kinds of sour
[14:46] there's sorrow there's Godly sorrow and
[14:49] their sorrow of the world the sorrow of
[14:51] the world is the sorrow that comes from
[14:53] not having from uh we're only put it
[14:56] this way from drinking from broken
[14:58] sisters right if you're drinking from a
[15:00] bubbling spring
[15:03] you've got Everlasting righteousness
[15:04] that's right that produces a Godly
[15:07] sorrow of repentance to Salvation not to
[15:11] be repented of like he said
[15:13] but Godly sorrow that where you
[15:16] you're trying to uh get away from
[15:21] let do you want to let the old man die
[15:26] as opposed to sorrow of the world right
[15:28] of those that know don't know God but he
[15:31] trust is in themselves right or in some
[15:34] arm of Flesh who rely on the happiness
[15:37] of the world
[15:41] in all things brother Graham said
[15:48] in the seven Church ages he said in 1954
[15:51] I tell you we're getting an
[15:52] old-fashioned Revival like we used to
[15:54] have down in the country when they laid
[15:55] on their face all night long not to
[15:58] carry on
[15:59] but when real goddess are
[16:02] and not go back to the Altar and stay
[16:05] but go out and make it right with the
[16:08] neighbors they had made it wrong with
[16:10] it and get straightened up I think
[16:12] that's such a powerful quote because we
[16:14] think
[16:16] well if we kind of uh
[16:22] you think well I've got this Godly
[16:24] sorrow I'll just stay at the altar and
[16:26] and that will be instead of getting up
[16:29] and doing what God requires they'll make
[16:32] it right with your neighbor
[16:33] um
[16:34] I'm struggling with how to say this um
[16:39] obedience is rather than sacrifice you
[16:41] do good do what God requires you know a
[16:43] lot of people say well if I have a
[16:45] sincere heart God will accept me uh even
[16:48] though I you know you can read in the
[16:50] words it says repent and be baptized in
[16:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:54] whoever if I go and be baptized in the
[16:56] name of Father Son and Holy Ghost that's
[16:57] good enough but God has required in his
[17:00] word for you to obey him right just like
[17:02] uh remember Abel abaded his Revelation
[17:05] that he had right and took the lamb
[17:09] instead of doing what seemed more
[17:11] beautiful and more uh righteous and holy
[17:14] like Cain did put all of his uh his uh
[17:17] the crops of the field on the offer
[17:19] instead of taking a bloody lamb and
[17:21] sacrificing that which is what God
[17:24] required God required Blood on the offer
[17:26] amen sometimes the writer what what is
[17:29] right what needs to be done right is
[17:31] more messy it's it's not comfortable
[17:35] it's not comfortable to get up to
[17:36] approach your brother and say I was
[17:38] wrong forgiving it's not comfortable to
[17:41] um
[17:44] God being misunderstood in 1961 and said
[17:48] what comes first
[17:49] repentance
[17:51] Godly solder for your sins
[17:53] then turn away and then be baptized in
[17:56] the name of Jesus Christ
[17:58] it's all right you've done all this for
[18:00] a mission of sins
[18:03] in 1963 just what just once more Lord he
[18:06] said but when it comes right down to
[18:07] putting what you say you believe into
[18:09] practice
[18:10] and willing to confess the role they
[18:13] don't do it it just isn't there
[18:17] and you can say what you believe all day
[18:19] long but we didn't really need to put
[18:20] what you believe into practice right
[18:22] that's that shows the difference
[18:25] they don't have it well that's real
[18:28] confection that's what we need we've
[18:30] long-lived that a long time ago and
[18:32] swapped it prayer and confession and
[18:35] conviction we swapped it for a motion
[18:38] shaking or jerking or jumping up and
[18:40] down that's the reason there's no
[18:41] holding tight because there's nothing
[18:43] there to hold them until you come upon
[18:47] the basis of God's word
[18:49] of Godly sorrow ready to repent and make
[18:52] anything right and do what's right ready
[18:55] to live right I don't care what the
[18:57] people say or anything else you live for
[18:59] your Jesus Christ and what he said then
[19:02] you take a church like that coming back
[19:04] there's a possibility of it coming but
[19:06] they're not willing to do it right
[19:10] and the scripture says blessed are they
[19:13] that mourn
[19:14] for they shall be comforted how will
[19:17] they be comforted
[19:19] let's go to John chapter 14.
[19:30] John chapter 14.
[19:36] let's look at verse 12.
[19:40] actually let's start it
[19:52] yeah verse 12.
[19:55] so after he had washed their feet and
[19:57] had taken his garments and was sat down
[19:59] again he said unto them no ye what I
[20:01] have done to you you call to you you
[20:04] call me master and Lord and you say well
[20:06] for so I am
[20:09] if I then your Lord and Master have
[20:11] washed your feet
[20:13] ye also ought to watch one another's
[20:16] feet
[20:17] for I have given you an example that you
[20:20] should do as I have done to you
[20:23] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[20:26] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[20:28] that is sent
[20:30] greater greater than he that sent him
[20:33] if you know these things
[20:36] happy are you if you do them
[20:44] well
[20:47] I'm reading verse 13. sorry chapter 13.
[20:54] Chapter 14 verse 12.
[20:58] verily verily I say unto you
[21:01] that believeth on me the works that I do
[21:04] shall he do also
[21:06] and Greater Works than these shall he do
[21:08] because I go into my father
[21:11] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[21:14] that will I do that the father may be
[21:16] glorified in the son
[21:18] if he shall ask anything in my name I
[21:21] will do it
[21:22] if you love me keep my Commandments
[21:24] and I will pray the father and he shall
[21:26] give you another comforter that he may
[21:28] abide with you forever
[21:30] even the spirit of Truth
[21:33] whom the world of this is this is going
[21:36] to tie up the spirit of Truth is going
[21:37] to tie into it when we get to hungry and
[21:40] thirsting for righteousness
[21:42] whom the world cannot receive because it
[21:45] sees him not that's right neither
[21:47] knoweth him but you know him
[21:49] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[21:52] you
[21:52] I will not leave you comfortable us I
[21:56] will come to amen so there's a scripture
[21:58] that if you say it's somebody else
[22:00] there's another person there's three
[22:02] different persons he said we will send
[22:04] you a comforter ride I'm coming to you
[22:06] yet a little while in the world see if
[22:08] me no more but you see me because I live
[22:11] you should live also and that day ye
[22:14] shall know that I am in my father and he
[22:16] and me
[22:17] and I and you
[22:19] the morning of the Holy Ghost for the
[22:22] morning
[22:23] like first she comes to realize the
[22:25] Revelation that you're poor in spirit
[22:27] you begin to mourn and you're being led
[22:30] to remember that someone on the mount is
[22:33] God Jesus is establishing his new
[22:35] kingdom a new kingdom is Christ in you
[22:37] so that the day that morning will be
[22:39] comforted because he will send a
[22:41] comforter to comfort us
[22:45] uh
[22:51] the morning is um
[22:53] and evidence of the Holy Ghost when we
[22:55] talked about um
[22:57] I'm just reading this real quick
[22:59] leadership chapters 1965. really are you
[23:02] a genuine Bible Christian full of love
[23:04] oh God remember the Bible said in the
[23:05] last days when this time takes place he
[23:07] said I'm marking Angel went through the
[23:09] churches went through the cities and
[23:11] sealed only those who sought and cried
[23:12] for the Abomination that was done in the
[23:14] city
[23:15] now pick out is your heart still
[23:17] concerned about the sinners and the way
[23:20] that the church and the people are doing
[23:21] to you can sign cry about it day and
[23:24] night if not so I'm wondering that's the
[23:26] scripture
[23:28] so uh in the last five minutes or so
[23:31] let's go back to Matthew
[23:33] five five
[23:35] listed on the Meech and are they showing
[23:39] here and here and
[23:45] okay
[23:56] now um
[24:00] meekness is um something that uh
[24:04] a lot of people maybe misinterpret for
[24:06] um being a pushover but now a real
[24:10] Christian that takes hold to the word of
[24:12] God is not a pushover that's right when
[24:15] it comes to believing God's word amen
[24:17] you can't push around a Christian and
[24:19] say that ain't right right
[24:21] if I was a Christian I'll take God's
[24:22] word and
[24:24] and the meat will inherit the earth
[24:27] so what is the earth in the Old
[24:29] Testament they uh
[24:32] went into tan and Titan was like
[24:35] obtaining the promised land was uh to us
[24:38] as a type of all the promises of this
[24:41] new kingdom the meat will inherit every
[24:44] promise of this new economy that God has
[24:47] set up
[24:49] foreign
[24:52] looking down through the the
[24:55] attitudes that we've looked at so far
[24:58] poverty of spirit I need God
[25:01] in your mourning over your lost
[25:03] condition you're starting to judge
[25:05] yourself your Sorrowing you're realizing
[25:08] that more and more that you need God
[25:10] you're drawing closer to God and then we
[25:12] get to humility and I'm just abandoning
[25:15] all pretenses at my own personal Merit
[25:17] and I'm Meek and lonely like Jesus I'm
[25:21] quiet gentle easily imposed on
[25:24] um mild submissive
[25:26] somebody can tell me where I'm wrong and
[25:30] I will
[25:32] take that to heart and try to do better
[25:36] and in the Old Testament uh the best
[25:40] example for me is no I'll just read this
[25:43] real quick numbers 12 1-3 and millions
[25:47] of minimum Marion and Aaron uh were
[25:49] speaking against Moses and speaking
[25:51] against Moses because of the Ethiopian
[25:52] woman who he had married for he had
[25:55] married an Ethiopian woman
[25:58] and isn't that just that opposite of
[26:01] meekness that after all the signs and
[26:04] wonders that had been wrought through
[26:05] Moses they had seen the serpent uh
[26:08] turned into the staff and the seed part
[26:12] of it and then now they're going to come
[26:13] and say well he married an Ethiopian
[26:15] woman that's just like a lot of us today
[26:17] you may uh yeah
[26:19] bring up a little uh try to find little
[26:22] faults after all the many miracles that
[26:24] we've seen
[26:27] for he had married an Ethiopian woman
[26:29] and they said half the Lord indeed
[26:30] spoken only by Moses
[26:32] has he not spoken also by us
[26:35] and the Lord heard it
[26:38] now the man Moses was very meat above
[26:42] all the men which are upon the face of
[26:44] the Earth
[26:45] and that's uh something to be said above
[26:48] all the people that are on the face of
[26:50] the Earth and what real true meekness is
[26:53] I believe is that you don't have
[26:55] anything to prove let God fight your
[26:58] bowels and that's that's exactly what
[27:00] happened with Moses this God
[27:03] God heard it it's not the Lord heard it
[27:05] and he came down and he fought Moses
[27:07] battles for you he'll he'll back you up
[27:10] around and said if I preach his word
[27:12] he'll back it up
[27:17] laughs
[27:19] and he turned Moses turned his back on
[27:22] worldly honors and Earthly reaches and
[27:24] he turns just like Jesus did he chose
[27:26] the life of a pilgrim over a Pharaoh's
[27:28] Palace because when Jesus came to Earth
[27:30] he could have he could have come
[27:33] with a big entourage and a big
[27:35] celebration that he came locally in a
[27:37] manger and Moses could have rolled up in
[27:41] a Pharaoh's Palace but he turned to the
[27:43] side
[27:44] aside from that and went into the
[27:47] Wilderness and found God
[27:50] and when in Exodus 3 11 after God had
[27:53] found Moses Moses said unto God who am I
[27:56] that I should go into pharaoh and that I
[27:58] should bring forth the children of
[28:00] Israel out of Egypt
[28:01] now maybe Miriam Manera would respond a
[28:04] little bit different yeah I'll be glad
[28:06] to go because I've got maybe all this
[28:09] education all of my My Flesh to back me
[28:12] up but Moses
[28:15] uh was relying he found that all he had
[28:18] to rely on was on God and God would back
[28:21] him up
[28:22] in Psalm 25 9 it says the meek will he
[28:24] God in judgment
[28:26] enemy will he teaches away because the
[28:28] meat can be taught
[28:32] in Matthew 11 29 Jesus said take my yoke
[28:35] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[28:38] and lonely in heart and ye shall find a
[28:40] rest into your souls
[28:43] now let's look at Galatians
[28:46] 6.
[28:51] Galatians chapter 6.
[29:12] just real quick
[29:15] a real true meekness
[29:18] is how we should approach our brothers
[29:21] and sisters if we find a fault
[29:24] Galatians 6 1-3 Brethren is from man be
[29:28] overtaken in a fall you which are
[29:31] spiritual restore section one
[29:33] in the spirit of meekness
[29:35] considering thyself lest thou also be
[29:38] tempted
[29:40] because meekness realizes that
[29:44] all of his strength comes from God and
[29:46] if it wasn't for God
[29:49] but where would we all be
[29:51] what none of us are better than the
[29:53] other right we have the Holy Ghost God
[29:56] sees us all the same we can all approach
[29:58] God to take advantage of his promises
[30:00] that he promised to us and the program
[30:04] said meekness was to let the other man
[30:06] have what he wants
[30:09] and the sudden secret going away to the
[30:10] church in 1958 he said what do we care
[30:12] what the world says a real Christian
[30:15] this is one of my favorite quotes what
[30:17] do we care
[30:19] oh sorry the next part is this this one
[30:21] is two but the next quote is one that I
[30:23] just have cherished all my Christian
[30:26] Life what do we care if we have to be
[30:28] despised and rejected blessed are the
[30:30] meat for they shall inherit the earth
[30:31] the Boston Center coming one day and
[30:33] we're going to do away except for what
[30:35] difference does it make to us to us if
[30:37] you love his appearance and in Hebrews
[30:38] chapter 7
[30:39] 1957 he said
[30:41] now you've noticed Abraham he doesn't
[30:43] fuss with a lot he said we are brethren
[30:45] we must not argue but you lift up your
[30:48] head and you go any way you want to go
[30:51] so he let God lock shoes first and if
[30:54] you go east I'll go west you go north
[30:57] I'll go south that's the Christian
[30:58] attitude we're willing to give the other
[31:01] man the best of the deal always present
[31:03] it to him let him take his choice for
[31:05] why
[31:06] what made Abraham do it
[31:09] he knew that he was promised by God that
[31:12] he would inherit the whole thing in it
[31:14] now
[31:15] so then a tent or a college why should
[31:18] we care the whole thing belongs to us
[31:21] and this attitude affects our how we
[31:23] treat other people listen this
[31:25] blessed are the meat before they should
[31:27] want to hear of the earth It All Belongs
[31:29] to us God said so so give the man the
[31:31] best of the choice if he wants to
[31:34] because
[31:35] maybe that's all he'll ever get right
[31:40] maybe that's all he ever did that's
[31:42] something to think about when you come
[31:44] across people through life is that maybe
[31:47] they've got a big fine mansion in this
[31:49] life because they won't have a mansion
[31:51] in the world to come that's right
[31:54] because they'll turn down the gospel let
[31:56] people uh
[31:57] treat people nice because this might be
[32:00] all they'll ever get right but it all
[32:03] belongs to you The Heirs of Salvation by
[32:05] promise and if it all belongs to you if
[32:07] you've got that Revelation that it all
[32:09] belongs to you that it shouldn't be that
[32:11] hard to treat other people
[32:14] that way let's uh let's stop right there
[32:17] amen that's it amen
