TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thanks to brother donny for taking last sunday and now brother joe's thing next sunday we will be at brother richard wilson's church no no no no pointing no i'd do the pointing you don't be still on all right let's turn to saint john one did anybody lose this it's been laying here for a while it's a versace eye glass cleaner okay i think john 1-1 and what we're doing is we're kind of doing a comparison to the son of god and some man and we brought god showing that he was like in the beginning and that light became flesh called the son of man so we're going to go back and read john 1. we're going to read it like the original greek or the original latin in your latin vulgate so you ready let's go everything's on in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him who this logos and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now he's telling how that now john is telling how this light gets introduced there was a man sent from god his name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light not the little l-i-g-h-t this is capital l-i-g-h-t the light the light the logos the light that was before the foundation of the world that all men through him might believe he was not that capital l-i-g-h-t but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighted every man that cometh into the world capital he was in the world the world was made by him and the world near not came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave me power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of the man but of god love means from so he's born from god all right and the logos was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now we see a word here begotten son of god is not begotten begotten is something that comes forth from you that creates a lineage begotten josh hannah whatever begotten they were begotten of us to bring forth something to you can say in our terminology perpetuate the species all right you know now we're sitting yesterday in the in the mall down at um discover meals just wasting time not wasting time we were going to pick up the wreath why would you waste time picking up the wreath we weren't wasting time we had extras we had extra time so so we so we spent extra time wasting it waiting on the rings so while we were there we bought a diamond ring for my sweetheart and our anniversary is wednesday so i want to say on the internet and all over the world the best woman that ever was walked the face of the earth right there 31 years in my sweetheart all right so this while we were sitting there we were sitting in the food court here's all these people and i was thinking on genetics and all the things of what we preached on regeneration at brother gerald hughes churchill how god regened us or regenerated us you know took us from our old genetics to our new genetics and that whole you know not belittling anyone to not make ourselves great at all not at all but the only generation that's gonna come out of that whole three or four hundred people if they weren't born again was going to be june and myself because we were regenerated from above they were all regenerated from the earth every person ugly pretty big little they all came from one act sex act okay down here on earth to make a natural genetics but if they're not re-gene from above if there's no regeneration then there's no perpetuation of our species as far as christians that's why that he become the only begotten melchizedek was not begotten melchizedek was that logos that just formed a body stepped into that body walked to meet abraham could not do any good to abraham except to prophesy and tell him what was coming all right because god changed his body we know that but then he died so that wasn't the total promise he gave the promise to abraham and his seed all right so and it wasn't isaac because isaac did the same thing as daddy did he give his wife away did the same thing his daddy did okay abraham so it wasn't a natural genetics but all those people that was in that mall yesterday their natural genetics they just you know they people go back and search their genetics here and some were tall some were short some were you know different shapes short waisted long wasted all the things of that what i'm trying to say is you ought to understand one thing when you're if you're born again today you are not of this world you are a totally different race of people and the world sees it by making movies and things about these extraterrestrials about people coming and living among us and they take on human bodies and they're of this super race this superman this superwoman all that types what's going on now right in the midst of the the greatest eden satan's eden that ever was god is birthing children just like he wanted to do when he was in this form because when in genesis 1 26 he created man in his image correct not flesh bodies theophany one theophany this guy right here that logos was that theophany and it was not just a light that was pulsating it was a human man the same man that walked ashore to galilee but it wasn't the same flesh he wasn't in flesh then he picked up the flesh because when he made this world that's where he got his flesh from that body yes he had a spirit body but then what we're trying to see is is the difference between this man and this man but there's not a difference it's just showing the i guess you want to say now the genealogy of god because this is the genealogy of god and you say well this hey look the all the old testament so and so forgot so-and-so so and so we got so-and-so so we got so-and-so all in these chapters of chronicles leviticus deuteronomy numbers and all that's what they did the number of people but god said okay you can have this natural genealogy but it's only going to type what i'm going to do in the spiritual form spiritual genealogy is what he wanted to start with because actually his genetics was what we're talking about when john picked this up and said in the beginning was the logos or the word and the word was god and that word with is a relationship it wasn't two people but it was god knowing all the children he'd ever have and he could glory i told you many times before if i was infinite if i was an infinite man and and i was going to have 100 children if i was infinite i'd know every one of them because i know who they are i know what their name was i know what they look like because they come from me and i would be infinite but us being finite we have to drop down like adam and eve through an act of of of sex or an act of of permission but it all works back to the same to the same thing god said okay you won't have a natural genetics but through that natural genetics i'm going to have a spiritual evil we got this one to this one this one to this one this one or this one to bring you but other than that all that natural genetics is going back to the dust they're just all that that was in that and sometimes it just makes you it never makes me feel exalted it always makes me feel so little that god would think so much of just me and her the only people and maybe three or four hundred people in that food court maybe great men that really thought a lot of their genealogy just dust bible says brute beast made made for destruction um i think of that often on the way down because you passed so many cars sure that have such a lot of people in you know and you get and you think that possibly you're the only one that believes what you do and i was reading shalom listening to shalom and brother branham says here but really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that we have never seen one another we hear each other speaking but we've never seen each other right that's right but god had to allow because of what happened in genesis god had to allow a natural seed genetic line to come to the earth to get you here like we were saying last night in bible study for those of you that weren't here i think of that many times what happened in the civil war because the civil war was was americans fighting americans and it wasn't like americans fighting germans it wasn't two genetic lines fighting each other it was the same genetic makeup we were all just one we all live together in the same city in the same farm a lot of times one sun would go fight on one side another sun and go fly on the other side but somehow down through there all of our lineages come down through there because unless you were you know born from another country okay which you had your war sister just to read the the island was populated some way some somehow and i don't know the total history i know some but still god brought something to that island to get her here this little island up in nowhere you know self-sustained itself for a while enough to bring her and brother keith and all the believers over there so god really cares about his children he really cares about his children why wouldn't you even as a natural father care about your children but so much god knowing where you'd be what you'd be doing how you'd get here and that's uh brother gary atkins and i talked a lot about you know the bible says the bed is undefiled and without that you'd have a question about how we all got here why god would use something like that to just speak in a little plane today but i think about it though about your natural being how you got here your mama may have been out in california daddy in new york she may have dropped her or her handkerchief while they were passing in an airport 50 years ago and he picks up the handkerchief and says here ma'am well you were inside that man but your mama had your body they had to come together to get you here the amazing stories of how and and and you know we don't want to spend a lot of time on on this natural part but god thoughts enough of it to get you here and then start regening you are regenerating you from that then you can say i'm not the son of charles and elle brown like brother brown did on community message not denying there's no way he was denying where he came from listen people he wasn't stupid he was a human he knew where his kids came from he wasn't denying that he said his father was a drunk they didn't even they weren't even religious didn't even go to church he didn't go to church i was reading the other day he said he polished his forward on sunday he said he polished it until he almost polished the paint off of it to keep from going to church but one day god got a hold of him but he wasn't a christian at that time he was about 18 20 years old somewhere in there and but how god brought him you think god would bring him and i like the question that ryan brought last night was why would god it looks like god would be a respecter of persons if he told brother around not smoke not to drink and he didn't do those things but it's like we all kind of conferred and and the point was and and the point i made was was that god was not protecting the man william branham he was protecting the gift that was coming right it was not protecting william branham if that case would be he would be a respecter of persons but he was he was he was holding that gift but the gift had to come through that man but now look people he tried to drink he tried to smoke he tried to commit suicide it wasn't that he never tried those things god allowed him to try it you know to try to do it not to drive but just trying to do it to show that he was human if those bullets would have went off he would have killed those kids and been a murderer right pointed the gun right out and pulled the trigger was going to kill him right was going to kill that man that poisoned his dog was put the gun to his head pull the trigger the gun didn't go off put it down the ground shot all six shots right on the ground he tried but god was not protecting william brown when he was protecting his guilt because when god was finished with him the devil got him that's right he was born with that gift exactly he wasn't born right he was born with a gift because gifts and callings are without repentance right you've seen times when i've seen times that people were out in the world just be a just be a total center but have a little gift to be able to tell things about people i'm saying it myself and you know somebody be a little a little bit well all those psychics what do they do brother brown said they pervert what god shows they pervert it they can enter a realm they can enter a realm where they can actually see look at the witch of endor she brought samuel right up out of out of paradise but brother brown said that was before christ died after christ died you can't do that anymore because they went straight into paradise they weren't in the bosom i mean they went straight into heaven they weren't weren't in paradise or the bosom of abraham so but this person that we're talking about that john brings the genealogy down and says this person is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now let's go to colossians 1. okay verse 15. very familiar scripture but we have to bring this down to the person who is the image of the invisible god in other words colossians paul is showing that the son of god that created all the heaven and earth was now embodied in the son of man the firstborn of every creature colossians 1 15. the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and they're in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist by who by this son the one who was the first born of every creature okay and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now let's go to revelation 3 god brought his family down through revelations 1 2 now look at number look at three the last church age sums it up 14. and until the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation of god now we know god cannot be created he's the one that does the creating but for our side this is for us dummies to realize that there had to be a beginning of our thoughts of what god was because we can't think eternal thoughts yet all right so there's a time we didn't know him all right the firstborn from the dead we know was jesus christ the firstborn from the dead and what did he do he resurrected if he had not resurrected he would have died like like um ryan asks another good question why was abel not in a genealogy if you don't bring four children you don't have a genealogy remember cain killed abel so abel's it says adam seth and right on down through they left amble out well there was a reason why they left abel and came both out he left kane out because cain had no national natural genetic line from adam his genetic line came from the beast natural abel's natural line come from adam but he didn't read gene or regenerate anybody adam begot seth and then seth had a child named enos so there he perpetuated his genealogy seth was killed remember i mean abel was killed remember so abel couldn't have a genealogy if you were killed before you had kids your genetic your genetic line stops right so that's why able was not putting any kind of in any genetic lineup because you didn't have children all right showing now what was able to type of christ abel and seth abel died i've gotten a man from the lord eve said brother brown said that was christ that was a type of christ dying and then seth being part of the resurrection bringing the species on out because this is the firstborn from the dead what did he do he resurrected that never happened before okay we know lazarus came for us but lazarus died again but this man we're going to go in isaiah and read for just a minute before we go about what this man did uh where it says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature now bring you back home i'm going colossians 1 colossians 1 15. the question is the first one of every creature for by him were all things created he's going to both that's before adam that's before and again but the firstborn of every creature the logos wasn't born was it no but jesus remember brother branham said that that god was not a creation but only in christ was he a creation remember this is our for our brain not for his god didn't god didn't die god can't die right the son of man the flesh man died to show brother brown said it was an actual play you don't die we think that ends everything no you don't die right right but the firstborn of every creature so the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature and actually scofield goes right straight to revelation 3 14. go right to revelation 3 14 the beginning of the creation of god jesus christ not the flesh man jesus christ created all things but remember in god's mind he had to be a baby we got to remember that remember god's not in a line everything to god's right here every present god can't be a day older than he was you know 57 billion trillion years ago he's not a day older so he knew that jesus christ would come be the firstborn of every creature he's the one who created it all right so everything what came forth from him right the logos everything came forth from that logo because it says even the creation whole creation came from this jesus christ because it says it says right here by him all things were created so it was all born from him anyway see this is talking about the whole world then he narrows it down verse 18 the firstborn from the dead firstborn from the dead what he died he rose again nobody's ever done that before and continued living so he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence everything was made by him everything begun from him that man christ the logos the the word the speech and it was god you can't make any difference out of that it was god but there had to be a time that it was born from his you know take a thought take a thought that thought had to be born in your brain somewhere right he had to be born he had to be in in its infancy then from that thought comes a lot of other things right a lot of things come from that little thought that you had about something and then it just evolved same way god is only pro the only problem we have is naturally we don't remember nothing and then we have a thought and it comes up god always knew but there had to have a time that god spoke something and right there is when it started was the earth is the earth eternal we know it's going to be made eternal right but it wasn't before all things there's only one thing that was before all things and that was this logos that we're talking about this right here this was before all things right the son the son the son is the one that done the creating but it's not another god it's him moving over in another form so we can understand him right people this is all this is nothing for god that's all for us that's right it's for us to be able to understand god already knows right he's all-knowing we can't we tend to forget that that that god did all this to remind himself of something no he didn't he's reminding us right of all this that's going on he's he's getting us to where we can understand how can you understand something a god how can one person understand a god that made everything every universe every star er all the sun and all the components of that sun and spoke and said that sun will never go will never stop burning who did that the human being's what amazes me that all the he made all the things sure that don't work this doesn't work that don't work what gets me is is when god starts with that one little seed and how do the how does my fingers know not to grow together i mean my armpit this this cell knows to grow to this one to put this together but why doesn't these little cells in here because the baby's not like this all the time he comes from little nubs and then it comes out then all of a sudden these cells start forming around some way somehow to me that's a mystery exactly i mean oh darn a mystery a mystery but god has made that mystery so simple now until we can understand because he started look at all the times in the bible he said the firstborn from the dead the firstborn from this in the beginning in the beginning what god don't have a beginning in the beginning of our understanding right of this eternal person he created the world in the beginning god created heaven and earth in what beginning he'd have a beginning if he had a beginning he ain't god so in our beginning of understanding god maybe that's what we ought to read in genesis in the beginning in our beginning of our understanding of god he created heaven and the earth in our understanding in our beginning we of understanding god we see this man come from here this man that we can't understand to this man that we can't understand mean to me that's the only way i know to put it in in simple terms but let's go like that flesh man easier than we can relate to that spirit man well absolutely absolutely because we but we've got to believe it because we never saw him in that human form that's right we never saw him in human flesh exactly you got to be a believer okay you got to believe that that man right there walked the shores of galilee and that man was in him that's right yeah but that man was limited by what that man could do because he had to breathe he had to eat he had to do the things of the world because he was the firstborn firstborn birth because he could be our brother there's no way milk has it can be our brother he wasn't born what right there's no way melchizedek could be our brother because he was created adam couldn't even be our brother that's why adam couldn't be our i mean our father he couldn't be our father because he wasn't a baby the bible says you got to be a kinsmen well we didn't all start growing we started as a baby let's go down to that 53 and we'll read that's where we'll begin in two weeks lord it's already october and then y'all gonna have a lot of november the 13th and the 21st and the 20th of 21st 13th and 21st y'all have substitute teachers i think 53 who has believed i reported whom in the arm of the lord revealed now we're going to break this down i'm going to read it fast give you a little seed to think about then we'll start over all right preacher grew up before him as a tender plant this isaiah is explaining jesus christ all right 2 000 years before he gets here or actually 1300 years before he got there all right all right actually i'm sorry 700 years before he got there he has no form of coming us and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with grief now as you talk about this man or this man this man he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he had borne our grief and carried our sorrow yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities which has ties one of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and afflicted yet he opened out his mouth he has brought us a lamb to the slaughter and the sheep before his sheer is done so he opened on his mouth now verse 8 isaiah is fixing to get ready to show us what's going on because he's fixing to separate the two men all right or the the way that we're going to be redeemed because actually if you'll read verse 3 through twelve that's your sixth full purpose of daniel okay finish the transgression make an end of sin look how many times says transgression iniquity sin all that right he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation there we go back to abel because isaiah knew let's interpolate just a moment isaiah's thinking isaiah thought verse 1 through 7 this guy must have to die because look what he's doing look at all that he was despised rejected wounded bruised he knew this man wasn't gonna make it this man wasn't gonna make it right but he said who shall declare his generation now generation is what genealogy isaiah knows he's cut off from among his people in other words they're gonna kill him he cannot regenerate himself in the grave for he was cut off out of the land of the living all right he's going to die for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with a wicked with a rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any of the seat in his mouth now here's where he's going to declare his generation yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he has put him to grief but thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed now when you see seed you've regenerated when he shall see his seed in other words when when i became a father and saw josh i knew my generation at least would go one more time but here's a god has put his soul on the line all right we need to stop right there but he put his soul on the line he shall see his seed prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify a minute where he shall bear their iniquities therefore will that divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide his poor the strong because he hath poured out in his soul unto death not in death you cannot kill us all right but he poured it out unto death and we'll we'll just think look up that word unto it may help you a little bit all right let's go up front thanks for being here uh
