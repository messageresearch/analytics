[9:28] you this morning Reverend
[9:30] all these people with these Ties on look
[9:32] hey no ties no ties no
[9:35] ties bless you somebody Benny says I had
[9:39] on my pajamas but I'm going to tell you
[9:41] something the Bible doesn't say we're
[9:43] going to wear ties in heaven it says
[9:45] we're going to wear
[9:49] robes so we're going to be wearing robes
[9:51] so get used to
[9:54] it for those of you that have a problem
[9:56] with the not wearing a tie this is
[9:58] called a baron and there's nothing wrong
[10:00] with a
[10:03] baron it's comfortable brother Lis has
[10:06] got a one too that in the Philippines
[10:08] this is considered a a sharp dress
[10:11] tuxedo almost you know so
[10:15] um yeah they're catching
[10:17] on them ties are yolks of bondage is
[10:20] what I call them so I don't like any Yol
[10:23] of bondage that's for sure but uh in an
[10:26] environment when it's hot you don't want
[10:28] to wear it tie over there because buddy
[10:30] you will overheat so uh you'll notice on
[10:33] one of the videos that I did wear it one
[10:35] or the slide I did wear it one time and
[10:38] I was soaking wet when I finished so I
[10:40] quit wearing the tie I uh sister Gail
[10:44] gave a bunch and we left them over there
[10:46] and they wear them but uh most of the
[10:48] time you'll see them with these things
[10:51] on so good to be in the house of the
[10:52] Lord good to be back good to see all of
[10:54] you here if you have your Bibles let's
[10:56] turn to the book of Ephesians I was
[10:57] trying to find something to read morning
[10:59] that would um that would be helpful
[11:03] maybe to uh to kind of forward what I'm
[11:06] what we're going to speak on today so
[11:09] and we're not going to really speak on
[11:10] anything we're going to read this one
[11:11] scripture and then we're going to go to
[11:13] the U to the
[11:15] presentation um I want to thank you all
[11:18] again uh very much like brother Dale
[11:20] said you took care of the needs over
[11:23] there you took care of my needs
[11:26] financially while I was gone because I
[11:28] didn't work so all the money that you
[11:30] poured in that come from all the
[11:32] different places was used for the glory
[11:34] of God it was not used feverously and it
[11:36] was not used for junk it was used for um
[11:41] gas
[11:43] travel you know helping the brothers out
[11:45] with u meals and uh if you'll notice we
[11:49] ate at several places and and you know
[11:52] me I I'm like brother Dale I don't
[11:54] announce anything so I just I would go
[11:57] in their kitchen and while there's
[11:58] nobody there and i' I'd put a th000
[12:01] pesos under something so they'll find it
[12:04] when I'm gone you know instead of
[12:06] instead of finding it then I just either
[12:08] tack it on a refrigerator or slide it
[12:10] under a a fruit jar or something and
[12:13] when we'd leave they'd find it later on
[12:15] so it helped them out their exchange
[12:17] rate is 44 to1 so it's 44 pesos to one
[12:21] of our dollars so 1,000 pesos is uh it's
[12:26] a good wage for them their their average
[12:28] wage is about about $10 a day
[12:31] American average
[12:34] $10 not good but you know what they
[12:38] survive God takes care of them so before
[12:41] we get started let's uhu let's bow our
[12:43] heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord
[12:45] today that you would be the preeminent
[12:46] speaker in this service Lord that you
[12:49] would be the one that does the hearing
[12:51] also Lord and may the brothers and
[12:54] sisters of this congregation and that
[12:56] are watching online Lord that you would
[12:59] bless them Lord and show them today that
[13:02] the money that that sometimes is hard
[13:05] even excuse me hard for us to find in
[13:08] America that it does go to a good cause
[13:12] and what little we do put together is
[13:15] big in other places we seem like
[13:18] sometimes we're insignificant Lord but
[13:21] you said the least in the kingdom is
[13:22] greater than John the Baptist so the
[13:23] least that we give Lord is greater in
[13:26] the kingdom of God we ask just bless
[13:28] today be with us sanctify us for this
[13:30] journey bless us take care of us heal
[13:33] the sick bless the ones that are not
[13:35] here the ones that are that are sick be

[13:39] care of each one father just raise us up
[13:41] for your honor and glory in Jesus name
[13:45] amen Ephesians 6:1 we'll just read this
[13:48] to to maybe get us started finally my
[13:51] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[13:53] the power of His might put on the whole
[13:55] armor of God that you may be able to
[13:57] stand against the Ws of the devil for we
[14:00] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[14:03] against principalities and against
[14:04] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[14:06] this world against spiritual wickedness
[14:09] in high places wherefore take unto you
[14:12] the whole armor of God that you may be

[14:32] shield of Faith where with you shall be
[14:34] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[14:37] the wicked and take the helmet of
[14:39] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[14:41] which is the word of
[14:43] God praying always with all prayer and

[15:56] you how many of you got the um the
[15:59] overview from Brother Vernon uh if you

[16:29] emailed back and said they're going to
[16:30] be watching in so it's 20 minutes till
[16:34] 11: at night over there so you got to
[16:37] remember it took me about 3 days for my
[16:40] body to get used to because at 12:00
[16:42] during the day here it was 12:00
[16:43] midnight over there so it takes your
[16:47] body just a little bit of time to um uh
[16:50] to get acclimated because when I arrived
[16:53] it took about 3 days and on about third
[16:55] third or fourth day I crashed and uh
[16:59] then I got caught up and everything was
[17:00] fine so the same thing when I got back
[17:02] here so thank you again for for giving
[17:05] your support your money and most of all
[17:08] your prayers amen and taking care of
[17:11] June while I was gone so that's the
[17:13] longest we ever
[17:15] been longest we've ever been apart from
[17:17] each other sister Gail since we've been
[17:18] married so uh I think the longest was
[17:21] like 10 days in Jamaica was the longest
[17:22] we'd everever been away from each other
[17:25] so uh and then I don't know if she might
[17:27] have been with me those 10 days that we
[17:29] that we went to uh to Jamaica but um it
[17:33] was a wonderful trip um upon arrival
[17:36] most of you know my luggage got lost it
[17:39] just didn't get stuck it got lost and
[17:42] thank god sister Mila wherever she is
[17:46] helped to find the thing cuz they had I
[17:49] had to describe the luggage they had to
[17:51] find it put a tag on it I got it 6 days
[17:54] later so um but that's all right I got
[17:57] it and that's really where all this came
[17:59] about because brother Dale there you go
[18:01] brother Dale he had got three or four of
[18:05] these Baron when he was over there well
[18:07] they were in that suitcase so we had to
[18:09] go to the mall and everything's a mall
[18:12] over there it's there's no Standalone
[18:14] stores everything's in like a four deck
[18:17] or six deck Mall there's 400 and
[18:19] something shops in those malls 10 and
[18:21] something restaurants and one
[18:23] mall so we went to a mall and bought
[18:26] these uh Baron and uh and used them so I
[18:31] got so used to them I didn't care if I
[18:32] got my luggies back
[18:34] tonight cuz they had all the ties and
[18:36] all that Yol of bondage and all that
[18:38] stuff in them
[18:39] so some of that stuff I really didn't
[18:41] want to see again but um uh before we
[18:45] get started I know that um uh brother
[18:48] Joe and some of the others and I have
[18:49] been talking and um cuz he's the one
[18:52] that that pretty much set this up for me
[18:55] cuz uh I can't do it all like that but
[18:58] he's he's real good he and brother Luis
[19:00] and all those brother I just thank God
[19:02] for all of them that that can do that
[19:05] but the one of the questions was and I
[19:07] want to get to get started I want to
[19:08] tell you that you're going to see these
[19:11] four Central churches that are brother
[19:14] roels brother Nester brother Danny del
[19:17] mundo now they've all been here and
[19:20] brother um Vernon their churches are
[19:23] going to be the nice big churches all
[19:26] right but now remember they are in
[19:29] what they call Metro Manila where
[19:31] there's 15 million
[19:33] people 15 million people listen I will
[19:36] never complain about the Atlanta traffic
[19:39] ever
[19:41] again we come in one Friday night Regina
[19:45] Marty ain't got nothing on these people
[19:48] you know Marty you see Marty going by
[19:49] Atlanta every once in a while there
[19:51] might be 30 40 people on it there's 400
[19:53] people in each one of them cars and it
[19:55] looks like they got their face masked up
[19:57] against the and and then we were driving
[20:00] along and I looked down and there was a
[20:03] a white line was right in the middle of
[20:05] brother Vernon's car and I said are you
[20:07] in a lane he said
[20:11] somewhat it was five Lanes of traffic
[20:14] but there was five Lanes but there was
[20:17] six Lanes of
[20:19] cars then sister Anna there was
[20:23] motorcycles weaving in and out of every
[20:26] one of those cars I'm telling you those
[20:28] guys could run a road course over here
[20:30] and win every race they never hit a car
[20:34] we never saw one accident and they don't
[20:37] believe in turn signals or traffic
[20:41] lights I asked one guy that was driving
[20:44] for me I
[20:45] said John that that light was
[20:49] red he said what
[20:54] light I said John that light was red he
[20:56] said oh that means go
[21:04] so but you have and I mean you have to
[21:06] be an aggressive driver I told him I
[21:08] said the two things if I ever lived over
[21:10] there I would be a brake mechanic and a
[21:12] horn and somebody work on Horns cuz
[21:14] that's the two things they use the most
[21:16] is horns and brakes cuz if you may be
[21:19] those six lanes over if you need to be
[21:21] over here well you'll eventually you're
[21:22] going to get over there so you just
[21:24] drive yourself over there you know
[21:25] people stop and usually they don't blow
[21:28] the horn like we do over here in America
[21:29] and give them the one finger wave
[21:31] usually that is I'm coming through you
[21:35] know be cautious I'm coming through so
[21:37] they they beat but but these four
[21:39] churches there's 15 million people in
[21:43] metro Manilla and that's about the area
[21:45] of 285 in Atlanta now we know the
[21:48] traffic in Atlanta is bad and there's
[21:49] only like a million people in Atlanta
[21:51] probably two or three million maybe in
[21:53] the perimeter but you put 15 million
[21:56] people in one place place they told me
[22:00] they said when I got there asked brother
[22:02] burner and I said how far is it to
[22:03] brother so and so's church he said well
[22:05] it's only about 20 km which is close to
[22:08] 10
[22:10] miles I said he's that close he said no
[22:13] brother it take an hour and a half to
[22:14] get there 10 miles you literally run 10
[22:18] miles an hour and that's basically the
[22:21] only time we ever didn't have traffic
[22:22] was at 12:00 at night and it was about
[22:26] like Atlanta then but most the other
[22:28] other time it's it's horrible traffic is
[22:32] terrible but they're used to it I mean
[22:34] they're used to it and their churches
[22:35] can be 20 mil apart and have 400 people
[22:38] attend the church and you never have
[22:39] they never cross CU you can't get from
[22:41] one Church to the other for you know a
[22:44] couple hours traffic so these four
[22:47] Central
[22:48] churches to me I I was I was trying to
[22:52] explain to some people because you're
[22:53] going to see those churches are really
[22:55] nice churches and they've got several
[22:57] hundred people in their Cong ation then
[22:59] you're going to see some churches that
[23:01] are smaller churches that are um some
[23:05] are bamboo some are made out of tin some
[23:08] are made out of just curtains but if you
[23:11] didn't have those four Central
[23:14] churches that were so mission-minded
[23:16] like brother Danny and brother Vernon
[23:18] brother roel and brother Nester they
[23:22] they take what they have and they
[23:23] forward the gospel from those four
[23:25] churches and they're kind of the pillars
[23:28] of
[23:29] of uh you know if you didn't in other
[23:30] words if you didn't have them you may
[23:33] not have those churches out in the
[23:34] outskirts because they are very
[23:36] mission-minded they they do not live
[23:38] above their means they uh uh a lot of
[23:42] them live in the building where the
[23:44] church is like brother Danny he lives
[23:46] underneath his church and brother Nestor
[23:50] lives in his church you know the church
[23:52] is up here in his house is behind so um
[23:58] some of the the other ones I didn't get
[23:59] to go to brother Vernon or brother roels
[24:00] but they're you know they're all very
[24:03] frugal with what they do so you're going
[24:05] to see four churches that are nice
[24:08] really nice but they have to
[24:11] be in order to number one accommodate
[24:14] all the people that go to the church but
[24:16] even if you have four or 500 people go
[24:17] to your church over there you got to
[24:19] remember that a church this size in
[24:21] America would there would be more net
[24:24] tithe in a church this size than there
[24:28] would for 400 people over there cuz if
[24:30] their average rate is $10 a
[24:33] day if they pay tithe on $10 a day
[24:37] that's only $50 a work week that's only
[24:41] $5 okay so it's not like us that make
[24:44] you know four five 6 7 $800 a week where
[24:46] we can forward more than that our 10% so
[24:51] they do need help they they need help
[24:53] but you know there's one thing for sure
[24:55] I know brother Dale and I have been to
[24:56] different places uh in other countries
[24:59] and not one time in the Philippines not
[25:01] one did anyone come to me and say I have
[25:05] a need I need this I need that because
[25:07] in other places you go to a meeting
[25:09] especially with 40 or 50 or 60 pastors
[25:12] and they're always wanting something so
[25:14] that did not happen in the Philippines
[25:16] they they sure we're going to present
[25:18] some needs but it was always presented
[25:21] from the pastor or from someone working
[25:24] in that area not from a lay member
[25:26] coming up and say hey I need $20 for
[25:29] food they do they do eat okay I eat a
[25:32] lot of rice and then when I got finished
[25:35] and tired of eating rice we ate
[25:38] rice then I thought one day Christine we
[25:42] were going to eat
[25:44] dessert we had rice
[25:50] pudding it was
[25:53] flavored but it was more like
[25:55] [Music]
[25:57] eating um
[25:59] the cocking around the windows so but it
[26:03] was good I mean it tasted good but you
[26:04] just had to it lasts a long time it's
[26:07] almost like chewing gum you know you can
[26:08] chew it for a little while but but you
[26:10] know what though that's that's what they
[26:12] raise they raise a lot of rice and rice
[26:14] is is a staple over there and um and I
[26:18] did eat
[26:21] squid and turtle we not say any more
[26:24] about
[26:25] that and we did eat duck
[26:29] and several other things there were some
[26:32] things that they were very well brother
[26:34] brother Vernon's wife uh helped me one
[26:37] day because I saw something that looks
[26:39] so good and I said man I want some of
[26:40] that she said no you don't want that I
[26:43] said really I said looks good she said
[26:46] brother it was cooked in
[26:48] blood so it was it was not it looked
[26:51] good but it wasn't it wasn't going to be
[26:52] good when I tasted it she said you
[26:54] really don't want that so we went some
[26:56] got something somewhere else so they
[26:57] really took took care of me I was not
[26:59] sick one moment the whole three
[27:05] weeks but when I got off the plane I had
[27:07] diarrhea for three days
[27:10] so but that's all right I asked God to
[27:12] take care of me over there you know so I
[27:15] asked him to uh for me not to be sick
[27:18] and and and we were mindful of things
[27:20] you know that brother Joe Green helped
[27:22] me a lot uh and brother do Jackson CU
[27:26] they had just returned from there in
[27:27] December and they said don't drink the
[27:29] water which I knew not to do that we
[27:31] drank bottle water but they made a
[27:34] mistake one day and they drank a fruit
[27:39] drink but the ice was the ice from the
[27:45] tap of the house it was the ice and it
[27:48] made him sick so you kind of have to be
[27:50] mindful and and you always ask them is
[27:52] this filtered water and they'll say yes
[27:54] or no cuz they'll tell you they don't
[27:56] want you to get sick I mean they they'll
[27:57] tell you that
[27:58] and I'll tell you I'll give you a
[27:59] testimony to the Lord I uh got in a
[28:02] motel that night first first night we
[28:05] arrived brother Vernon got me in the
[28:07] motel and of course you know all of us
[28:09] we brush our teeth you know we get our
[28:10] teeth and then we tap water you know you
[28:13] get a glass of tap water and you wash
[28:15] your mouth out and then you drink the
[28:16] rest of it well stupid me well no
[28:19] ignorant me cuz this is a story behind
[28:21] this ignorant me goes into into the uh
[28:24] bathroom and brush my teeth fill a full
[28:27] glass of water up out of the tap in the
[28:30] bathroom and drank every drop of
[28:33] it
[28:34] so I walked into into the uh into the
[28:39] room and I sat down and I said what did
[28:41] you just
[28:43] do you just drank what they told you not
[28:46] to drink out of the tap at a at a
[28:49] motel so I said Lord there was a time in
[28:52] the Bible that there was an ignorance
[28:54] offering a sheo in the book of
[28:57] Deuteronomy I think or Exodus there was
[28:59] a sheo offering for ignorance so I said
[29:02] I plead ignorance on this one and
[29:05] brother uh brother Vernon or one of them
[29:07] he I told him that the next day he said
[29:10] well he said if you'd have done it twice
[29:11] he said that would have been stupid and
[29:12] he said there's no offering for
[29:17] stupid or stupidity he Ain call me
[29:20] stupid there's no offering for stupidity
[29:22] he there is an offering for ignorance
[29:23] but there's not an offering for
[29:24] stupidity so I didn't do it twice I just
[29:27] did it one time and and it never
[29:29] bothered bothered me a bit so so
[29:31] everything went everything went really
[29:33] well uh but those four Central churches
[29:37] are the biggest economy they're in the
[29:38] biggest economy areas and let me just
[29:40] tell you a little bit about the economy
[29:42] before we get started we were and I got
[29:45] two services to do this so if I bore you
[29:46] you can sleep and then we'll finish it
[29:47] this
[29:49] evening but we go to this place called
[29:52] Jolly Be and jolly be is the same as a
[29:54] McDonald's but it's a it's Philippine
[29:56] owned it's a hamburger joint all right
[30:00] and so we walk up to the porch and
[30:02] there's like 30 people look look to be
[30:04] probably 20 years old sitting so we go
[30:07] right through them and everywhere
[30:08] there's security guards everywhere
[30:10] there's a security guard I mean there's
[30:12] even a security guard at the sock
[30:14] counter at at the place where we bought
[30:16] our socks but um we go right on in and I
[30:19] asked the brothers I said what are these
[30:21] people waiting on are we in line you
[30:23] know were they in line did we break the
[30:24] line you know and brother royel said no
[30:28] brother
[30:28] said they're waiting for a job
[30:32] interview you have to have a 2year
[30:36] college degree to
[30:41] even to even be considered to work at a
[30:45] place called M like
[30:47] McDonald's all those 30 people had a
[30:50] 2-year college degree and was looking
[30:53] for a job making $10 a
[30:56] day they won't consider no one else no
[30:59] one else you have to have a 2-year
[31:02] college degree that's why they all look
[31:03] like they were 20 years old cuz they
[31:04] were in two years college and they would
[31:07] take them in five at a time and
[31:08] interview them and um so you know that's
[31:11] the economy over there sure there are
[31:13] some good things God does take care of
[31:15] his own kids
[31:17] amen and that's why you're going to see
[31:19] that those four Central churches or the
[31:20] bigger churches they have the more
[31:22] teachers and security guards and people
[31:25] like that doctors that can that can take
[31:27] take care of some of the offering that
[31:29] goes out in the other places if you
[31:31] didn't have those four Central locations
[31:34] then it would be worse than it is so we
[31:37] thank God for those four brothers and
[31:39] and the four pillars I call them of the
[31:42] uh of the Philippines and I know there's
[31:43] more people over there but those four I
[31:46] know are mission-minded and they do they
[31:49] forward the work of the mission all
[31:51] right so uh the accommodations you know
[31:54] you saw some of the accommodations they
[31:55] were very good they were very very nice
[31:58] and uh we did get to go to a bee farm I
[32:01] know you may saw some of that but got
[32:03] talk to a beekeeper for a couple hours
[32:05] and learned some things from him and and
[32:08] all that so but the first place we went
[32:11] to we come up here to this is the
[32:14] arrival and uh for those of you that
[32:17] don't know who these people are that's
[32:19] me that's brother Danny del mundo he's
[32:22] been here before now he has one of the
[32:24] churches this is Brother Royal Sano he's
[32:27] Christine's cousin and brother Nestor
[32:31] Espanola and this is Brother dendo this
[32:34] this is the one that I sent back and
[32:35] told him he worked for a mental hospital
[32:38] well he does not work for a mental
[32:39] hospital he works for a medical hospital
[32:41] he's in the security department so I was
[32:43] making a joke and sister Cynthia
[32:45] corrected me on that and said well I
[32:47] don't think he works for mental hospital
[32:48] and I was making a joke that he was
[32:50] there because of our
[32:51] mentality he was there to help us try to
[32:54] keep us out of the mental hospital and
[32:56] then brother Vernon's one that took the
[32:58] picture we start here and we're actually
[33:01] going to end up right here this is where
[33:03] we're going to end up but we all got
[33:04] together and kind of mapped out the plan
[33:08] of of where we were going to go and what
[33:10] we were going to do and it worked out
[33:13] very smooth they gave me a lot of time
[33:15] to uh to recoup and U but toward the end
[33:19] I promise you ain't no place like home I
[33:23] don't care America can be the dump of
[33:25] the of the world but when that security
[33:29] officer when when that uh um passport
[33:32] guy stamped my passport and he said
[33:34] welcome back home I said you ain't
[33:41] kidding he said I see you've been in
[33:43] manella for the Philippines for a few
[33:45] weeks he said what'd you do I said
[33:47] Mission work he said they need Mission
[33:48] work he said but welcome back to the
[33:50] United States and I said you ain't
[33:51] kidding buddy ain't no place like
[33:55] home but here was the arrival and we had
[33:58] a couple of days that kind of you know
[34:00] gold sightseing and first one thing
[34:02] other but the first church service was
[34:04] Sunday morning at brother Vernon's now
[34:07] brother Vernon's Church they call it the
[34:10] mega
[34:11] church because I didn't give the picture
[34:13] but behind that is two huge Towers this
[34:16] is shangala hotel is a five-star
[34:19] hotel and the reason that this came
[34:23] about was they all I think we going to
[34:25] brother nestor's
[34:26] church this this group of
[34:29] people that you'll see some of them they
[34:31] were all security guards in the shangala
[34:33] hotel brother Vernon was the head I
[34:35] believe he was the head of security
[34:38] there at the at the hotel well they got
[34:40] to share somebody shared the message
[34:41] with them then they got to sharing the
[34:43] message with their people then they got
[34:45] to share in the message well all the
[34:46] heads of security of the whole place
[34:49] come in the message at the same time all
[34:51] right so you know brother I think
[34:54] brother Nester was kind of you know he
[34:56] kind of said hey why are you driving
[34:57] hour and a half you know find a place
[34:59] and have church over
[35:00] there so the shangala hotel said
[35:04] well you can have it for x amount of
[35:07] dollars one of our U ballrooms and you
[35:10] can have it every Sunday now they may
[35:11] have to move because of some of the
[35:13] scheduling because they have a lot of
[35:14] weddings and a lot of stuff at this at
[35:16] this hotel but they have church there
[35:18] every Sunday and uh and the price is so
[35:22] cheap till you really can't go and and
[35:25] find another building so it's really
[35:27] nice if you'll go to the next
[35:29] slide this is their U musicians most of
[35:33] their musicians in most churches are
[35:35] young people most I did not see hardly
[35:38] any if you'll see some of these they're
[35:41] probably in their early
[35:43] 20s they do a very wonderful job um
[35:46] these brothers got together one night
[35:48] when we were at a sister's house and
[35:49] they were playing there uh also but uh I
[35:53] tell you something about their music
[35:56] their music is not they don't sing
[35:58] traditional songs they don't have a a
[36:00] song book like we do they sing more
[36:02] they're influenced a lot by and I don't
[36:05] say the people but the LA fontains a lot
[36:08] of their music a lot of the music from
[36:10] Brother bis's Church uh brother Donnie
[36:12] Reagan's Church uh the Y brothers and
[36:15] and lenel and some of those some of
[36:17] their songs they sing them so they sing
[36:20] more bride songs as far as you know
[36:24] updated they don't sing a lot of I let
[36:27] them in a Amazing Grace one night and I
[36:28] think that's the only time they sang A
[36:30] tra what we call a traditional song all
[36:32] the other songs are songs like I said
[36:35] that were written by others and that's
[36:36] okay I mean I'm not saying anything
[36:37] about it I'm just telling you a little
[36:38] bit about their
[36:40] tradition and their influence um they
[36:43] are uh they're good at what they do the
[36:46] the Filipino people are uh very service
[36:50] oriented um a lot of a lot of the people
[36:53] a lot of Filipino people that can't find
[36:55] jobs in the Philippines they go to Hong
[36:58] Kong or they go to different places in
[36:59] the world and they are the service
[37:02] oriented type people and also nurses so
[37:06] they they really um they take care of
[37:11] you make you
[37:14] feel but that's the church that's the
[37:17] mega
[37:18] church brother Vernon's probably got a
[37:20] couple hundred people maybe a little bit
[37:22] more cuz the church goes all the way
[37:23] back over here and you'll see the uh
[37:26] part of it in a minute there's no Pastor
[37:28] study so that's not me sleeping I'm over
[37:31] there praying or doing something I'm not
[37:32] sleeping that's for sure but um and
[37:36] you'll notice you'll notice two boxes in
[37:39] every
[37:40] Church they're not Catholic that's not
[37:43] bones of a priest that's a tithing box
[37:47] and an offering box they don't collect
[37:49] tithing like we do when they when they
[37:53] give the when they give the um uh time
[37:56] for you to give your tith an offering
[37:58] you actually physically go up there and
[37:59] put it in the Box all right so they
[38:01] don't uh they don't go around asking for
[38:05] you know go through the crowd they just
[38:07] start singing a song and people file up
[38:08] and either put it in the tithing tithing
[38:11] box or the offering box so you'll see
[38:12] two boxes at every Church they all do
[38:15] the same thing so this is and he has a
[38:18] lot of young people um a lot of young
[38:21] people in his church and um now let's go
[38:25] to the next slide
[38:28] they all have projectors it doesn't
[38:30] matter if what the churches back up in
[38:31] the mountains they all got a projector
[38:33] they all got a screen and they all sing
[38:35] off of those screens I didn't see a song
[38:37] book I don't think in any church that I
[38:39] went to except maybe maybe one but uh
[38:44] all right go to the next
[38:46] slide this is U this is this Head song
[38:49] leader I think his name is brother Danny
[38:50] he was a professional singer in
[38:53] bars and the Lord got a hold of him and
[38:56] saved his soul and and
[38:59] now he's singing for God not the world
[39:04] so that's that's him there you'll see
[39:06] him in several he he's a good brother
[39:07] real good brother but you see all the
[39:09] people here go ahead next
[39:13] slide this is Sam more saying go ahead I
[39:16] gave this brother I hope he's not
[39:18] watching I gave this brother my camera
[39:20] and I said take a few pictures he took
[39:24] 112 so I had to I had to sh shift
[39:27] through him cuz he's what and I kept
[39:29] seeing him go he you know I'm standing
[39:31] right here he'd go around over here and
[39:33] I'd see him walking he's like and I said
[39:35] what is this guy doing well he's taking
[39:37] 10 pictures at a time every time he goes
[39:40] around so go to the next one this is
[39:43] tell it brother
[39:44] Vernon's that's all that's all of us
[39:46] singing see all these young people there
[39:48] that's
[39:49] uh um that's his wife right there and
[39:52] his daughter Indy somewhere but and his
[39:54] other daughter is over here running the
[39:56] U running the computer most churches um
[40:01] a girl or a sister runs the U runs the
[40:05] computer part like we have the the
[40:07] brothers in the back so go you see that
[40:09] Bron that think that's a nice one there
[40:10] I like that one that one's blue it it's
[40:13] it's nice I like that one I like the
[40:15] material on the it better than I do this
[40:17] one but uh go ahead to the next
[40:19] one this is more of them singing and
[40:22] praying Church goes on back around over
[40:24] here now this is Brother Vernon go ahead
[40:26] this is Brother Vernon now most of you
[40:28] met him he's been here at the church and
[40:30] U he's U very um security minded because
[40:35] he was head of security for a f-star
[40:37] hotel so he couldn't make many
[40:39] mistakes but he would never let me go to
[40:41] the motel unless the door was shutting
[40:43] before he left he wouldn't let me get
[40:45] out of the car and walk to the motel he
[40:47] walked to the door with me made sure the
[40:50] door was closing and then he left
[40:52] so and they all did but he was always
[40:55] either walking beside me or behind me
[40:58] making sure there was nothing going on
[40:59] and he's pretty good siiz guy he's
[41:01] almost my size but um he's um his church
[41:05] is
[41:06] growing um it hasn't been there a long
[41:09] time you know just a few years so he
[41:11] really didn't have an anniversary
[41:12] meeting he has his later on in the year
[41:16] so we didn't do this was just a regular
[41:18] church service on Sunday morning go the
[41:20] next one that's where he introduced me
[41:22] so that and you see I've got a
[41:24] microphone in my hand in a few minutes
[41:26] you'll not see a microphone they said
[41:29] they could hear me loud enough so I put
[41:30] the microphone
[41:32] down Paul said I speak
[41:35] boldly of course you can say loudly if
[41:38] you want to go ahead next slide and this
[41:41] is getting started see there's a two
[41:43] boxes that's his daughter there that's
[41:45] his wife this is everywhere you went
[41:50] everywhere you went there was deacons
[41:52] and preachers somewhere around that
[41:54] Pastor always always in support and this
[41:59] is the Deacon here and this is the
[42:00] Deacon here now I don't know any of
[42:01] their names I can't I wrote a bunch of
[42:04] them down but I can't remember all that
[42:07] all right go to the next one and here we
[42:09] started and we spoke on the uh I I think
[42:13] maybe we spoke here before on
[42:16] the brother Brown said this messenger of
[42:18] Malachi 4 will do two things one turn
[42:20] the hearts of the children back to the
[42:21] fathers and then the second thing
[42:23] literally
[42:24] turned and we spoke on that how that
[42:26] literal means not a type and they really
[42:28] enjoyed it because we're not a type
[42:31] right everything types us everything in
[42:35] this Bible types the Bride of Jesus
[42:37] Christ you said well yeah well we do
[42:40] type Jesus Christ to a degree but still
[42:42] remember he's male right you can only go
[42:44] so far he's the male we're the female so
[42:47] we got our own distinct order and and
[42:51] everything types us so they really
[42:53] enjoyed that so you keep
[42:55] going on through this is still brother
[42:57] Vernon this is getting
[42:59] started very attentive very they
[43:01] listened I
[43:04] mean and then she did a good job cuz she
[43:07] pulled up most of the quotes that I had
[43:08] already go ahead that's his s that's his
[43:12] daughter somebody asked him why are they
[43:14] all smiling well I'm I made some kind of
[43:17] funny I guess I know what it is but
[43:20] it'll take a while for me to tell
[43:22] it cuz I told the people I told the
[43:24] people that um
[43:27] you know that the bride was on
[43:30] display not the
[43:32] groom and I told him I said you know in
[43:34] 1979 when June and I got married I said
[43:36] all this was up
[43:38] here you know I was had all my hair and
[43:41] and I thought I was the one that they
[43:42] was coming to look for you know cuz I
[43:44] was standing up at the altar first I
[43:46] said but when they started playing that
[43:49] Wedding March and them doors open they
[43:51] didn't care where I was they was looking
[43:54] for the bride so that's why they were
[43:56] laughing at me to tell in that story so
[43:57] go
[43:59] ahead keep going see there's the two
[44:01] there's the tithe and offering box I get
[44:03] close to
[44:05] it okay keep going I'm out in the crowd
[44:08] talking to them about something go
[44:11] ahead go back that brone looks good I
[44:13] like that thing that's a nice looking
[44:15] outfit that's I like
[44:17] that all right go
[44:21] ahead and then that's the finish of the
[44:23] service I'm telling them that the Bride
[44:26] of Jesus Christ is on display and that's
[44:29] what God wants he doesn't want to him he
[44:32] knows who he is he knows who he is he
[44:35] wants us to realize who we are amen so
[44:40] that was the uh the theme of the that
[44:42] guy kind of got it started with
[44:44] everybody and obviously they enjoyed it
[44:46] because of the what brother Vernon said
[44:49] um in his um trip overview so let's go
[44:53] now this is all this is this is the one
[44:56] that took the 100 and something
[44:58] pictures I had to hold him closer he'd
[45:00] have took another
[45:01] one but this is the Deacon this is
[45:04] Brother Vernon see he's
[45:06] almost I tell you if if they thought I
[45:09] played
[45:12] basketball I said no I could I've played
[45:14] football and baseball but I ain't big
[45:15] enough you ain't big enough to play
[45:17] basketball now if teren or or somebody
[45:19] them would have been over there they'd
[45:21] have been head taller than anybody cuz
[45:23] most Filipinos are about that size right
[45:26] there
[45:27] so I you know I'm a good four to six
[45:29] inches taller than they are and they
[45:31] thought I was a big guy but these are
[45:34] all deacons that's the song leader but
[45:35] these are all his deacons you saw
[45:37] everywhere he went you had all these
[45:38] people around brother Vernon
[45:42] so he's a good one well they all are
[45:44] good one
[45:46] but brother Vernon's conscious of a lot
[45:49] of things maybe that that other people
[45:51] are not conscious of because of his
[45:53] background and the same way with brother
[45:55] Dale he'll tell you he took care of him
[45:56] also right so let's go to the next one
[45:59] now we traveled then this is Brother
[46:01] nestor's church now brother nestor's
[46:05] Church excuse
[46:08] me Jos see you get me some water if you
[46:10] don't mind um no ice is it
[46:16] filtered and I tell you you really have
[46:18] to be careful cuz brother Joe Green told
[46:19] me he said they gave him a bottle one
[46:21] day of of water and he took it and he
[46:25] turned it and it didn't pop
[46:27] pop somebody had refilled it so if it
[46:31] didn't pop you just handed it back to
[46:33] them cuz they would refill it for them
[46:34] which it doesn't matter to me but it
[46:37] would have been water that wouldn't have
[46:39] been uh very
[46:41] desirable to drink and not to say that
[46:44] their water's dirty but it's just
[46:45] they're used to it where we're not used
[46:48] to it like when we went to TM
[46:52] Island they told me not to eat the fish
[46:55] because the the water is a freshwater
[46:57] lake and it's right in the middle real
[46:59] close to Manila and a lot of things get
[47:01] into that water that don't need to
[47:03] be and they eat it and enjoyed it so
[47:06] they bought me some
[47:07] chicken at McDonald's McDonald's has
[47:11] chicken over there just like Kentucky
[47:13] Fried Chicken but this is Brother
[47:14] nestor's Church it is actually in the
[47:17] old part of Manila kind of like Central
[47:20] Manila brother Dale didn't go to this
[47:22] one uh he was in another building when
[47:25] when Dad was there but this they've been
[47:27] in this building like 3 years now we
[47:29] think we have problems with our
[47:32] post this thing's about 3 foot oh
[47:36] wow and you'll see these people right
[47:38] here if I'm talking over here you'll
[47:41] they'll all be
[47:42] leaning cuz they're trying to look
[47:44] around the pole you know this Pole right
[47:46] here and there several other cuz it's an
[47:47] old
[47:48] theater and the stage is right here and
[47:50] this is an old theater well the the
[47:52] church goes on around and then the
[47:54] church goes on around this way then they
[47:56] have a b and he go to the next
[47:58] one thank you there's the uh sound
[48:02] system and that's part of it then it
[48:04] goes on around but
[48:07] these that they have monitors everywhere
[48:09] too but this Pole right here you see how
[48:11] thick it is that Pole right there it's
[48:14] about 2T by 2T so and there was
[48:18] probably 300 350 people there that night
[48:21] once this was his 27th anniversary
[48:24] meeting go the next one this was his 20
[48:26] this is the song leader they're all like
[48:28] I said most of them are young people
[48:31] this is the stage of the church all
[48:33] right and then the church goes on around
[48:35] over here so it's in a theater it's in a
[48:38] round setting like this really nice I
[48:41] like this setting of this
[48:43] church all right go ahead that's some of
[48:46] the Believers all dressed nice no one
[48:48] was no one was uh Dressed strong they
[48:51] all had on their long dresses and very
[48:55] conservative very very
[48:58] modest all right go to the next one this
[49:01] is the murderer's row
[49:03] here I told Brother Nester he's going to
[49:05] have to learn how to
[49:07] smile but that's brother Nester brother
[49:09] Danny brother Vernon and myself uh
[49:12] brother Royal was not able to make it to
[49:14] this meeting uh he came to the ministers
[49:16] meeting the next day so this is at
[49:19] brother nestor's church so and he's 27
[49:22] years he's been having his anniversary
[49:24] meeting so all right let's go to to uh
[49:27] to the next
[49:30] one next wake up uh there's all the
[49:34] young people uh musicians and they would
[49:38] you know they would get there some these
[49:41] these guys were there an hour before the
[49:45] service started and they would be
[49:47] practicing songs and then they stayed 20
[49:49] or 30 minutes afterwards practicing on
[49:51] new songs so they were really good
[49:53] stayed in key everything was fine
[49:57] so go to the next one but they're all
[50:00] young young
[50:02] Brothers here's a problem brother Nester
[50:04] speaks to Gallo so he's speaking to
[50:08] Gallo he introduces me well I don't know
[50:10] what he's saying I just hear him call my
[50:13] name so he he smiles and says come here
[50:16] well I walk over there I don't have my
[50:18] Bible don't have my notes or nothing I
[50:20] don't know what he's doing so I don't
[50:22] think I put it on the next one see this
[50:23] guy smiling right here cuz I'm I'm
[50:25] walking over I'm like what do you want
[50:28] he said I want you to preach
[50:30] brother so go the next
[50:34] one finally brother Dany brings my Bible
[50:37] brother
[50:38] Dany forgets his
[50:41] glasses so I happened to in my briefcase
[50:44] I've got on my contacts but in my
[50:45] briefcase I've got a pair of reading
[50:48] glasses well he has to put their reading
[50:50] glasses on and he interprets for me and
[50:52] does a really wonderful job so uh go to
[50:55] the next one
[50:58] and there's some of the
[51:00] congregation really pretty place I I
[51:02] like that high ceiling had real good
[51:05] acoustic go
[51:07] ahead and I spoke on a statue of perfect
[51:10] man and I it was less than two hours but
[51:12] they didn't care they really don't once
[51:14] you get in to start preaching you know
[51:15] they really don't care they really
[51:17] enjoyed it uh brother Danny did a real
[51:21] good job
[51:22] interpreting because brother nestor's
[51:24] crowd see it brother Vernon's you didn't
[51:26] see interpreter his people are more
[51:28] young people so they know English
[51:30] brother nestor's congregation since he's
[51:34] uh you may see this but the old man of
[51:36] the island he's the Elder Bishop of the
[51:39] island he's older so his congregation is
[51:42] older so they speak more to gallo and
[51:44] you had to have an interpreter I'll tell
[51:47] you a story about this a little bit
[51:49] later on but go ahead to the
[51:51] next listen very intense you can see now
[51:53] that the people are are over here now
[51:55] they're back up in here all the way
[51:57] around up in the top and back into the
[51:59] uh cuz there's a kitchen area right here
[52:01] that's separated by a
[52:03] wall sisters you think you have a
[52:05] problem feeding 100
[52:08] people they fed 350 people there that
[52:11] night at brother Danny's they fed 600
[52:16] people at brother Roy's they fed 400
[52:19] people in the morning and 700 people in
[52:21] the evening same day and did it just
[52:24] like that just like that
[52:27] that okay so I'm using this little girl
[52:29] for an example and you can't tell her
[52:31] face is red cuz she's brown but
[52:35] um okay go to the next one and then
[52:39] that's finished you see the chart's done
[52:41] so so we're finished there and and
[52:44] praying they really enjoyed it all the
[52:47] ministers these are all Minister
[52:49] Brothers here we're going to see some of
[52:51] these brothers in some of the other
[52:53] slides but we um I love that song um
[52:57] Christine I'd like for you to get that
[52:58] song I fought a good fight Paul I fought
[53:00] a good you know you know what talking
[53:01] about that one is a wonderful song that
[53:05] that they sing I don't know who wrote it
[53:07] you know who wrote is it one of their
[53:08] songs no it is one of their songs but
[53:12] I'd like to get that and let's learn it
[53:13] because Paul was talking about fighting
[53:14] a good
[53:16] fight and kept the faith and all these
[53:18] things so there we are at the end of the
[53:22] anniversary meeting and like I said we
[53:25] preached on the you of a perfect man now
[53:28] at the end of this service I don't see
[53:31] the brother over there but brother Alvin
[53:34] you'll see his church in a minute
[53:36] brother
[53:37] Nester took up money to put a roof on
[53:41] his church we'll see his church in a
[53:42] minute but they not only ra they raised
[53:46] enough money for the roof and I didn't
[53:48] think they'd get it but they got it it
[53:50] was it was up into the thousands of
[53:52] dollars Filipino and uh we as a church
[53:56] gave $200 American dollars to to finish
[54:01] the uh roof on the church and you'll see
[54:03] the church in just the just a little
[54:05] while so this is in central Manila this
[54:07] is now the next day ministers meeting
[54:10] and I told them I got to speak just I
[54:12] just did an introduction on uh on
[54:15] Ephesians
[54:16] 4 and I told him I said you know what I
[54:19] said you as ministers when you look out
[54:21] in your congregation I said all the
[54:23] Sinners sit in the back
[54:27] so they all moved up to the front I
[54:28] don't have a picture of that but they
[54:30] all started migrating to the front
[54:31] brother neer's right here you know and
[54:33] he's like well uh you might have made
[54:36] somebody mad I said really I don't care
[54:38] but I didn't want them back there I
[54:39] wanted them up here so preachers are
[54:41] just the same as lady they like to sit
[54:43] in the
[54:44] back so we brought them all up here so
[54:46] there was 70 ministers some of them
[54:49] drove eight to 9 hours just to get to
[54:52] the
[54:53] meeting and uh it was an all day meeting
[54:56] they fed them
[54:58] too and
[55:01] uh there the couple of topics were how
[55:04] do you witness to Muslims cuz there's a
[55:06] real big Muslim population down in menow
[55:09] and in the lower parts of of the
[55:12] Philippines there's U Muslim communities
[55:14] and they were trying to uh find a way to
[55:18] witness to the Muslims and they brought
[55:21] out some good points but we won't get
[55:22] into that and then there was one um
[55:26] Minister I asked a question about where
[55:28] their dinosaurs on the
[55:32] ark and I leaned over to brother I I was
[55:36] sitting right up here in the on the
[55:38] balcony where we were at the other day
[55:39] when you saw the picture the day before
[55:42] and uh brother uh Vernon or one of them
[55:45] was sitting there you know and I I said
[55:47] really it don't
[55:49] matter but come to find out and I want
[55:52] I'm telling this as a story because they
[55:54] have the same things to deal with that
[55:56] we have to deal with all right this
[55:58] Minister asked that question so he could
[56:00] get up for 30 minutes speak in English
[56:04] which I would thought was weird speaking
[56:06] English and he spends 30 minutes drawing
[56:09] all these charts about different things
[56:11] hardly ever says anything about
[56:12] dinosaurs so come to find out he's kind
[56:14] of like a um a lawyer and he does
[56:17] YouTube videos they were videoing him
[56:18] well he was not doing it for anything in
[56:20] the ministers meeting he was doing it
[56:21] for
[56:22] hisself so he could put it on YouTube
[56:25] and he asked this question kind of like
[56:28] a an attorney asked a leading
[56:30] question he had the answer or he didn't
[56:32] even want the answer he just wanted to
[56:34] be able to get up and talk about it so
[56:37] they have they work you know I told them
[56:39] I said y'all got the same Spirit on
[56:40] preachers that we got on over here they
[56:43] try to forward their own they're not
[56:45] really asking a question because they
[56:46] don't know the answer see when you we
[56:49] ask a question it needs to be a question
[56:50] that you don't know the answer to that's
[56:52] why I question but if you ask a question
[56:54] knowing the answer to it and and then
[56:56] you get up for 30 minutes and put your
[56:58] view into it and you really don't say
[56:59] anything about dinosaurs on the ark you
[57:02] have an agenda that's a little bit
[57:03] different so all the all these ministers
[57:06] knew that and uh and they talked among
[57:09] theel afterwards and we we had a good
[57:11] little good little chuckle about it cuz
[57:13] they ask about how is it in the United
[57:15] States I said well basically it's about
[57:17] the same way I said but the brother that
[57:19] moderates SS brother Tim Calhoun he
[57:21] wouldn't put up with that but one
[57:24] time they said well how do you how do
[57:27] you how do you stop that I said you know
[57:29] what I do if a preacher asks me a
[57:31] question and I'm going to write it down
[57:32] like is the dinosaurs on the ark I'm
[57:33] going to say do you know the answer to
[57:35] that question and if he says yes then
[57:37] I'll say we're going to something else
[57:39] because you already know the answer to
[57:40] it we know what you want to do but if
[57:42] you ask a question not knowing the
[57:43] answer then yes we'll forward that cuz
[57:46] there are answers to questions in these
[57:48] ministers they're all good ministers
[57:50] real good solid ministers they're not
[57:53] uh they're not um they're not babies in
[57:56] the gospel that's for sure not a lot of
[57:58] them are but that was my whole theme
[58:00] over there was trying to trying to help
[58:03] them become a little more mature in the
[58:06] gospel and and and I think maybe we
[58:08] accomplish that to a
[58:10] degree all right let's go to the now
[58:13] this is this is a this is called a jeepy
[58:17] now dad saw a million of these now what
[58:19] happens was in the in the Philippines in
[58:22] the ' 40s you know they were taken over
[58:24] by Japan in the war
[58:27] and then America goes over and liberates
[58:29] helps Liberate the Philippines they had
[58:31] a real big part in it too it wasn't just
[58:33] the United States but there's a big
[58:34] United States influence over there not
[58:36] as much now because we closed a lot of
[58:38] our military bases but we had The Old
[58:41] Willis Jeep Remember The Old Willis Jeep
[58:44] well this is made on basically the same
[58:46] style and they call it a jeepney there's
[58:49] a row of seats right here and the row of
[58:50] seats over here and Robbie there's no
[58:53] seat
[58:54] belts and there's be 10 or 15 sitting on
[58:57] this side 10 or 15 on this side three or
[58:59] four hanging right here two or three
[59:00] sitting up here and about four or five
[59:04] right back here hanging on to the back
[59:06] right and then they stop and pick up
[59:08] more
[59:10] people but these things are built on the
[59:13] style of the the Willis Jeep of the
[59:17] American Soldier or the American Army
[59:20] but they do build these in the
[59:21] Philippines and that is their model it's
[59:23] not a you know it's not a redo they
[59:26] actually make these and that's some of
[59:27] them's made out of stainless steel some
[59:29] of them I didn't show pictures of cuz
[59:31] they didn't have good graphics on the
[59:32] side of them if you understand what I
[59:35] mean and a lot of them was you know had
[59:37] G picture of Jesus and a picture of the
[59:39] Pope and picture of all these things on
[59:41] it so I kind of took one that was a
[59:42] little clean that uh there was no
[59:44] graphics on but that is a big part of
[59:47] their that's their taxi cab and and like
[59:51] I said it's uh it's over full most of
[59:54] the time and they probably
[59:57] 10,000 of them just in
[1:00:00] Manila cuz that we went he went by a
[1:00:02] place and cuz they pointed they said
[1:00:04] your dad saw that place right there and
[1:00:06] they were just lined just you know
[1:00:08] several hundred of these things that
[1:00:10] were either being repaired or bought or
[1:00:13] wasn't driving that day cuz they rotated
[1:00:15] them out so it was hundreds of them
[1:00:16] sitting in a field just hundreds of them
[1:00:18] just lined up just like you'd see that
[1:00:20] place down in Toyota place down in
[1:00:21] Commerce just lined up waiting to be
[1:00:24] driven but that's a lot of their
[1:00:26] transportation cuz most of them don't
[1:00:27] have cars that's a lot of their uh their
[1:00:31] transportation and it's pretty cheap but
[1:00:32] they make good money those those jeepy
[1:00:34] drivers do do pretty
[1:00:37] well and uh man they're full most of the
[1:00:41] time go ahead so this is where we were
[1:00:44] heading to a place called dingalan now
[1:00:47] dingalan is up north it's a beautiful
[1:00:50] place this is where brother Dale was at
[1:00:53] he and brother Ernie and brother Vernon
[1:00:56] drove up there to see the landslide
[1:01:00] there was a um a landslide that killed
[1:01:04] several hundred people destroyed
[1:01:06] homes um they literally just took
[1:01:09] bulldozers and pushed the stuff out in
[1:01:10] the ocean and let it sink bodies and all
[1:01:14] cuz brother Danny said they were selling
[1:01:15] fish real cheap after that and I said
[1:01:17] why are they selling fish cheap he said
[1:01:19] you'd open them up and they'd have body
[1:01:20] parts in
[1:01:22] them so that's what I mean they just
[1:01:24] pushed everything out in the ocean and
[1:01:26] let it go because it was so much
[1:01:28] destruction and brother Dell saw that
[1:01:31] and you're going to see how that in 10
[1:01:32] years that it all grew back up now this
[1:01:34] is the first brother here here's this is
[1:01:37] we drove for close to 4 hours
[1:01:41] actually I'm
[1:01:43] sorry we got an hour and a half out of
[1:01:46] the first thing that I want to that I
[1:01:47] want to tell you that happened I you
[1:01:49] know I asked the Lord to do something in
[1:01:51] during this trip that would um that
[1:01:54] would help me
[1:01:56] y need help as much as the rest of you
[1:01:57] do but when we were beginning this trip
[1:02:02] brother Nester where's he at he may be
[1:02:05] the one taking the picture but that's
[1:02:07] brother Jojo that brother is the one
[1:02:09] that drove daddy around yeah right there
[1:02:12] and daddy put a roof on his on his house
[1:02:15] brother Danny there's brother NY right

[1:02:31] Deacon and song leader and he does an
[1:02:33] outstanding job this is John this is my
[1:02:37] bodyguard I won't show it but his arms
[1:02:39] is about as big as that spoon right
[1:02:41] there so it shows him doing this you
[1:02:44] know I said John if you going to be my
[1:02:47] bodyguard I said you just stiffen up and
[1:02:50] I'll use you as a baseball
[1:02:53] bat cuz he was a little old bitty thing
[1:02:56] but he drove me around and uh I I gave
[1:02:59] him a th000 pesos one day and he about
[1:03:02] cried yeah he was that's only uh how
[1:03:05] much is
[1:03:06] that 44 to one that's not much so he he
[1:03:13] but he drove me around a lot but anyway
[1:03:15] he was driving brother nestor's van and
[1:03:17] I didn't get a picture of the van but
[1:03:19] that van needed some help when we
[1:03:22] started so we started from Manila we got
[1:03:24] an hour and a half we got on a toll road
[1:03:26] and it started running hot that was the
[1:03:29] hottest day we had it was
[1:03:31] 98°
[1:03:33] Fahrenheit and uh 30 something Celsius
[1:03:36] but um it was
[1:03:37] 98° that day and the van started
[1:03:41] overheating started boiling water out of
[1:03:44] the radiator so we were standing on side
[1:03:46] of the road before we got to brother
[1:03:48] Val we were parked on side of the road
[1:03:50] trying to get the temperature back down
[1:03:53] and uh and they were all it's like
[1:03:56] and I'm going to tell this because
[1:03:57] brother royel told this this is how
[1:03:59] these people are in the Philippines he
[1:04:01] said you can wipe out their whole house
[1:04:04] you can just destroy their business you
[1:04:06] can take everything they got and he said
[1:04:09] you'll see them floating down the street
[1:04:11] in a tub taking a selfie
[1:04:14] going and they've lost everything
[1:04:17] they're just that you know they're
[1:04:18] resilient people and so you know they're
[1:04:21] they're not worried about this van and I
[1:04:23] mean we we we're an hour and a half in
[1:04:24] our journey
[1:04:26] we've got another two and a half hours
[1:04:28] to go to get to
[1:04:29] dingalan
[1:04:31] so I got concerned cuz I like air
[1:04:34] conditioning we had two cars brother
[1:04:36] Danny's got a new car um so I was riding
[1:04:39] with them but all these other brothers
[1:04:41] was riding in the van and uh they had to
[1:04:45] cut the air conditioner off cuz it
[1:04:46] started overheating well I just leaned
[1:04:48] up against the van and obviously you
[1:04:50] know what I was doing I was praying and
[1:04:53] brother brother Nester said by way do
[1:04:55] you you sick you know CU I was leaned
[1:04:57] over the van like he said you sick not
[1:04:58] feeling good I said no I'm praying leave
[1:04:59] me
[1:05:00] alone and uh he said oh okay so I prayed
[1:05:04] that we'd get back and you know we did
[1:05:06] we got back that we had to fill it up
[1:05:07] with water a couple of times but we made
[1:05:09] the 2 and 1 half hour trip and I mean
[1:05:11] this guy this brother V is up on a
[1:05:13] mountain uh in a Military Reservation
[1:05:16] and uh we made it all the way to
[1:05:17] dingalan two and a half more hours sure
[1:05:20] we had to put some water in it but we
[1:05:21] made her back home so God blessed us
[1:05:24] with that uh
[1:05:26] with that opportunity to pray for that
[1:05:28] because they were they were like well we
[1:05:30] can't go back home and because we're an
[1:05:31] hour and a half that way call somebody
[1:05:33] to come get us or whatever you know I
[1:05:35] said let's just try to fill it up water
[1:05:37] and brother Jojo he's a mechanic too so
[1:05:40] he started filling it up with water and
[1:05:42] you know we made it all the way up there
[1:05:43] and back so God blessed us on that that
[1:05:46] 4H hour trip so uh so the first visit we
[1:05:50] go to is brother B now this brother here

[1:07:43] he couldn't drive on the interstate
[1:07:45] because it's too low of CCS he had to

[1:08:17] is down in the bottom all right keep
[1:08:21] going that's us it they always want to
[1:08:23] have a picture taken at the pull pit
[1:08:24] with the you know with the pastor okay

[1:08:45] every 2 or 3 years so he's building
[1:08:46] along a little at a time um his that's
[1:08:50] home now go to the next
[1:08:53] one brother Nester told me
[1:08:56] he said brother the way you should have
[1:08:57] never had your picture took of that nice
[1:08:59] Motel he said you should have your
[1:09:00] picture took of
[1:09:03] this cuz brother Nester told me he said
[1:09:05] brother the way don't you know there's a
[1:09:06] blue book and a red
[1:09:08] book The Blue Book you don't ever show
[1:09:11] anybody the red book is what you show
[1:09:12] everybody you show you show everybody
[1:09:14] this and and I have one picture of me
[1:09:16] standing there and this thing is wire
[1:09:19] and my head's up about here That's how
[1:09:20] little that thing is my head's right at
[1:09:22] the
[1:09:23] wire so this is his deacon's house
[1:09:26] house that's a home that's where
[1:09:28] somebody
[1:09:30] lives all right
[1:09:35] next I showed you these for a reason cuz
[1:09:38] two of them are not with us
[1:09:43] anymore I brought them back with
[1:09:46] me they were
[1:09:48] good but I told Brother Val he he raises
[1:09:51] them see all the different age groups
[1:09:54] and I told him I said I like Duck cuz
[1:09:56] I'd eat duck over here before I said I
[1:09:58] like Duck he said okay he said I'll
[1:10:01] bring you some next brother Danny's
[1:10:03] meeting so two of them are not with that
[1:10:06] picture anymore I don't know which two
[1:10:07] so I'm not going to I'm not going to
[1:10:09] judge but they were
[1:10:11] good so they were
[1:10:13] sacrificed but uh he raises these ducks
[1:10:16] as a side business also and sells them
[1:10:18] so go ahead that's the back of his house
[1:10:21] now right here go to the next one
[1:10:26] that's their men and women's bathroom
[1:10:28] wow men and
[1:10:34] women yeah there's no petition there I'm
[1:10:38] not holding anything
[1:10:40] up that's the
[1:10:43] bathroom and they're just as happy as a
[1:10:46] lark to have that and actually I told
[1:10:48] them I said there's only one place I Saw
[1:10:51] toilet seats and that was in the
[1:10:53] motel nowhere
[1:10:56] somebody bought them one one time like
[1:10:58] brother Jackie Benton or somebody I
[1:10:59] think bought him one and they got
[1:11:01] insulted that they bought them a toilet
[1:11:04] seat so or they felt you know they felt
[1:11:06] you know that we didn't think it was
[1:11:09] good enough for us to use that but
[1:11:11] that's their bathroom I think they are
[1:11:12] going to make a petition eventually but
[1:11:14] this is all kind of new but this is the
[1:11:16] back of his church and that's mainly all
[1:11:20] of uh churches have this facility for
[1:11:24] their for their for their bathrooms so
[1:11:27] all right go
[1:11:28] ahead now we're at the church now the
[1:11:31] reason I didn't take any pictures
[1:11:32] outside is because when we left brother
[1:11:34] BS we went to a Brother Ray
[1:11:37] quare and I didn't put a I I don't know
[1:11:40] if I lost the pictures or not and then a

[1:11:44] churches before we got there to the
[1:11:46] dingalan church when we did it was dark
[1:11:49] so we were going to stay there overnight
[1:11:51] and then I was going to take pictures
[1:11:53] later so this is the church
[1:11:55] that brother Dale 10 years ago gave
[1:11:58] money to to build and I'll give you the
[1:12:00] story behind that when we see the

[1:17:38] congregation but they were sitting out
[1:17:40] here I'll show you in a minute they were
[1:17:42] already overflowing out of the building
[1:17:45] and sitting over here well now sister
[1:17:46] prey's house is right here so the the
[1:17:49] the Widow's house is right here the
[1:17:50] pastor's house now is over on this side
[1:17:52] and then they built houses around that
[1:17:55] and brother Dale and another brother
[1:17:56] from Germany are the ones that built
[1:17:59] this brother um gird you remember
[1:18:03] brother remember the German brother that
[1:18:04] preached for
[1:18:06] us Becker Marcus Becker his pastor and
[1:18:10] Dad help build this church all right so
[1:18:12] go to the next one this is the inside
[1:18:15] they were all there were more seats out
[1:18:17] that night that we were there and this
[1:18:20] is the next day afterward there was a
[1:18:22] big old green lizard run right across
[1:18:24] through there I'm talking about a big
[1:18:26] old not an iguana but it was a big one
[1:18:29] cuz I told Brother Vernon he said I saw
[1:18:31] it I said I was I was hoping that maybe
[1:18:34] it would fall down and it' have a
[1:18:36] Revival up there in the front but they
[1:18:39] didn't but that thing stayed right up
[1:18:41] here and run around through there and he
[1:18:43] said yeah I saw it so anyway this is the
[1:18:45] inside of the
[1:18:46] church now this is the pastor of course
[1:18:49] brother Nester brother Vernon brother
[1:18:51] Danny and myself at the pull pit there
[1:18:53] the next day so now
[1:18:58] next that's the pastor's
[1:19:00] study that's the pastor's
[1:19:05] office kind of crude
[1:19:07] huh and right behind it right over there
[1:19:10] past that petition is another one of
[1:19:12] them one hole bathrooms all right so
[1:19:15] this is the pastor's study go to the
[1:19:17] next one they about outgrown their
[1:19:20] building so what they're wanting to do
[1:19:21] is now this is sister prey's house this
[1:19:23] is her that's her little U thing the
[1:19:26] road's right there so they're not far
[1:19:27] off the highway but the people were
[1:19:30] sitting all out in here that night
[1:19:31] they've grown to something people in
[1:19:33] that little building so what they want
[1:19:35] to do is is enclose to here enclose that
[1:19:38] take this wall out put a door right here
[1:19:42] and uh it's going to cost about I think
[1:19:43] brother Vernon said about $3,000 to
[1:19:46] finish all that plus make him a study
[1:19:48] back here in the back that we just saw
[1:19:50] and put another bathroom facility cuz
[1:19:52] there's only one bathroom there
[1:19:55] so that's that was a need that was
[1:19:56] presented not to me but I asked them how
[1:19:59] much it would be cuz they were talking
[1:20:00] about you know expanding they do all the
[1:20:03] work their yourself any material cost
[1:20:05] that would be all material cost they
[1:20:07] have no labor everybody in that church
[1:20:09] does the work so there's
[1:20:11] no contractor fees or or anything labor
[1:20:15] wise that's all materials all right so
[1:20:18] this is that's the church in dingon that
[1:20:20] they want to try to expand this is the
[1:20:22] side of it this is sister prey's house
[1:20:24] here but this is the side I just want to
[1:20:26] show you the depth of it they want to
[1:20:28] come on out about another 15 or so feet
[1:20:30] this way and uh take out this wall and
[1:20:33] have more space to uh to worship but as
[1:20:36] far as the church
[1:20:37] structure go far as the structure it's
[1:20:40] really good I mean it's built well uh
[1:20:42] the sides are built strong it's a really
[1:20:45] nice building if it was painted it look
[1:20:47] it look beautiful but all they need is
[1:20:49] just lver it on the Windows they don't
[1:20:50] need any no air conditioning all right
[1:20:53] go to the next one that's the uh this is
[1:20:56] the
[1:20:59] shower and that's the toilet shower in
[1:21:02] the
[1:21:04] toilet that's it right there you just
[1:21:06] run you some water in there you take
[1:21:07] that thing right there and and then you
[1:21:09] either if you do it real slow if you
[1:21:11] just like to trickle or you can do it
[1:21:12] real fast you can do this but that's the
[1:21:14] shower that's the shower stall and
[1:21:16] that's the toilet all in the same room
[1:21:18] so and they're just as happy to have
[1:21:21] that running water as as anybody so
[1:21:25] if your uh if your uh nice little shower
[1:21:29] ever goes out just
[1:21:31] remember we can go back to the bucket
[1:21:34] and I'm sure some of y'all some of you
[1:21:36] old daddy I'm sure remembers that old
[1:21:37] bucket with the standing in that bucket
[1:21:40] and first time I went to Jamaica that's
[1:21:42] how I took a
[1:21:43] shower took it in a tub like that with
[1:21:46] cyan water which was a little
[1:21:50] brown so anyway so we come from there um
[1:21:54] we come back to another brother's church
[1:21:58] and we ate again let's go to the next
[1:22:00] slide this is Brother Alvin's church now

[1:22:57] just it's humped up and all got grass
[1:22:59] and everything in it but they're working
[1:23:00] on a little at of time and uh trying
[1:23:04] their best to get it done so they can

[1:23:08] this was from dingalan we went
[1:23:10] back got home safe in that same van that
[1:23:12] we prayed for the day before we got home
[1:23:15] safe and then we went to brother Dennis
[1:23:17] credito this is his song leader went to
[1:23:20] his church
[1:23:23] on uh
[1:23:26] Thursday we had Thursday night service
[1:23:28] there and he's building a new church
[1:23:30] that brother Joe Green and some of the
[1:23:32] others have helped purchase the land and
[1:23:34] it was so dark I could not take pictures
[1:23:36] I couldn't get my iPhone to to flash but
[1:23:40] he has Church down a back street that's
[1:23:43] just wide enough for a motorcycle to get
[1:23:45] down and uh but they're just as happy as
[1:23:48] they can be so go to the next one and
[1:23:50] that's us getting ready we're getting
[1:23:52] ready to go there and then now
[1:23:55] again that's brother Dennis he's the
[1:23:57] pastor of the church uh we preached on
[1:24:00] um the book of books how that we were
[1:24:03] the book The open book and really
[1:24:05] enjoyed it didn't get a picture of the
[1:24:07] congregation there was probably 40 or 45
[1:24:09] people there and
[1:24:12] um I I got the one God thing down you
[1:24:16] see many of the pictures I got one
[1:24:17] finger up the only
[1:24:19] one all right go ahead and that's where
[1:24:22] we're preaching on the book
[1:24:25] and then this is his house this is the
[1:24:26] wall of the church the church is here
[1:24:28] and you just go right around and you go
[1:24:29] into his house and it's just a probably
[1:24:32] from here to there
[1:24:34] long and he had this is his two children
[1:24:37] really sweet
[1:24:38] wife and uh and brother Dennis their
[1:24:42] church is up on a hill about maybe not a
[1:24:45] quarter of a mile from where they're at
[1:24:47] brother Joe Green helped them by the
[1:24:49] building and let tell you something
[1:24:51] about that the owner this the owner of
[1:24:55] the property there's an existing
[1:24:57] building in it
[1:24:59] burn well for about a year they were
[1:25:01] wanting to brother Dennis and them were
[1:25:04] wanting to purchase it the owner
[1:25:07] wouldn't let them purchase it didn't
[1:25:09] even want to sell
[1:25:10] it well supposedly people started going
[1:25:14] by because the street goes down like
[1:25:16] this and the the the house is right here
[1:25:18] and it's pretty good size bank but the
[1:25:19] house is right here people started
[1:25:21] seeing ghost in the house
[1:25:28] the guy sold it to him for
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:33] nothing I told him I said it was a ghost
[1:25:35] all right it was a holy
[1:25:39] ghost but people kept and it's right it
[1:25:42] an intersection and you look up and they
[1:25:43] said they started they'd see lights and
[1:25:45] people you know somebody moving through
[1:25:46] the house and cuz it was burned down it
[1:25:48] was just nothing but a shell and um we
[1:25:51] went up there and look they've dug out
[1:25:53] for the basement already got the
[1:25:54] basement dug out but they don't have
[1:25:56] enough funds to finish the building yet
[1:25:58] but I think brother Joe Green's working
[1:26:00] on that and I'm going to talk to him
[1:26:01] about it a little bit later and see what
[1:26:03] U see how much they got on it but he's a
[1:26:05] real good brother um I think he's a part
[1:26:09] of the one of the mystery Expos I think
[1:26:11] I think he is they can correct me on the
[1:26:13] internet if they're watching in but I
[1:26:15] think he's a product probably 50% of the
[1:26:18] people I met were products of the mix
[1:26:20] mystery Expos that they started back in
[1:26:23] 2004 with brother Ernie and brother roel
[1:26:25] and all those that that uh did a lot of
[1:26:28] work back then but that mystery Expo
[1:26:30] you're going to
[1:26:31] see um tonight cuz you're not going to
[1:26:33] see it today I'm going to finish it's 10
[1:26:35] minutes till 12 this is about half way
[1:26:38] through so but this was a rest day this
[1:26:40] was Fort Santiago brother Nestor took me
[1:26:43] there and it was built in the 1500s so
[1:26:47] it's a lot older than brother
[1:26:51] dick found something older
[1:26:54] this fort was built by the Spaniards in
[1:26:57] 1500s it's been occupied by everybody
[1:26:59] even Japan occupied it in World War II
[1:27:02] America came in and and helped the
[1:27:04] Philippines liberate but one before they
[1:27:06] liberated them there was 10 and
[1:27:08] something people back over in here that
[1:27:10] were prisoners of the Japanese and the
[1:27:13] Japanese killed them and buried them in
[1:27:15] a hole before the Americans and
[1:27:18] philipinos could find them so a lot of
[1:27:20] sad history with that but also that was
[1:27:23] a fort that that's kind of in central
[1:27:25] part of Manila and it's a historic site
[1:27:28] there was
[1:27:29] a uh brother and I like brother Nester
[1:27:32] because I told him I said you're you're
[1:27:35] old enough to know some of this
[1:27:37] history so he was a good tour guide we
[1:27:39] went to the National Museum before we
[1:27:41] went to here so we got to know a lot of
[1:27:45] history of the Philippines and um a
[1:27:47] wonderful history uh back from the
[1:27:50] Spaniards for 3 or 400 years and then
[1:27:52] others came in mellin if those of you
[1:27:55] that know anything about history mellin
[1:27:57] I think he was killed over there and but
[1:28:00] he was one of the ones that that come to
[1:28:02] the island and it had a real big Spanish
[1:28:05] influence for a long time so that's Fort
[1:28:08] Santiago and there was a man named Jose
[1:28:11] Ral and uh he was a he's their national
[1:28:15] hero just for a second I'll tell you
[1:28:17] about him but they they kind of type him
[1:28:19] with Jesus Christ not that he was a very
[1:28:21] religious man but he went against the
[1:28:23] Catholic Church church he wrote two
[1:28:25] books and I got him at home they they
[1:28:27] they found them for me in English and um
[1:28:30] he wrote two books and they more of a
[1:28:33] it's more of a parable of what the
[1:28:36] Catholic church was doing to the people
[1:28:39] on the island he was writing uh an under
[1:28:43] a parable an underlying meaning he was
[1:28:45] telling what they were doing and there
[1:28:47] was a big Revolt came up uh he didn't uh
[1:28:51] he did not incite any riots or any
[1:28:54] revolts but the people caught what he
[1:28:56] was saying that the Catholic church had
[1:28:58] suppressed him and done all these things
[1:29:00] to him and um um they had a Revolt well
[1:29:05] when they brought when rile came back to
[1:29:08] the to the
[1:29:09] Philippines they tried him and convicted
[1:29:11] him of treason and shot him executed him
[1:29:14] not too far from here they kept him in
[1:29:16] here in this prison then they walked him
[1:29:18] out and uh shot him in a firing squad um
[1:29:22] the Catholic Church says he handed
[1:29:24] before he died
[1:29:28] but he didn't but they've got a monument
[1:29:31] for him over here and he he was he was
[1:29:34] he's a national hero now so I got to
[1:29:36] learn a little bit about him he I'm I'm
[1:29:38] getting started on the book that he
[1:29:40] wrote but he was very smart man he was
[1:29:42] an optometrist he an eye doctor and he
[1:29:44] traveled around the country and uh then
[1:29:47] now here we are at the same rest day we
[1:29:49] go over to brother uh Vernon's family
[1:29:53] this is you see all this right behind it
[1:29:56] here and behind it over here are big
[1:29:58] tall buildings but what happens is they
[1:30:01] have a lot of their uh a lot of our call
[1:30:04] centers are over there because when it's
[1:30:07] midnight over here it's daylight over
[1:30:09] there and vice versa so there's a lot of
[1:30:11] people go to work at midnight because
[1:30:14] it's 12:00 during the day here they go
[1:30:16] to work and have all the call centers
[1:30:18] well what happened was there's no place
[1:30:19] for them to eat all the restaurants were
[1:30:20] closed so they started a what do you
[1:30:23] call call it a plaza this is a plaza
[1:30:26] this is a bunch of restaurants and what
[1:30:27] they do is at 10:00 at night they bring
[1:30:30] all their street food from the different
[1:30:33] local restaurants and they put them and
[1:30:35] they have like this this right here is
[1:30:37] one section and that's where I saw the
[1:30:39] the the meat that was cooked in blood
[1:30:42] it's back over here but there's probably
[1:30:45] 30 restaurants we see they they service
[1:30:49] those two buildings till 4:00 in the
[1:30:50] morning then they take every bit of this
[1:30:52] up and it's a parking lot for the
[1:30:54] daytime
[1:30:55] people but man I'm going to tell you
[1:30:57] something I wanted some street food this
[1:30:59] is street
[1:31:01] food this is chicken on a
[1:31:04] stick and something else on a
[1:31:06] stick and something else in that pot
[1:31:09] right there but you could get whatever
[1:31:12] you wanted but these right here are
[1:31:13] mango shakes and if you'll look see them
[1:31:15] straws they're huge there's Bigg around
[1:31:18] bigger round of my thumb because it's
[1:31:20] got chunks of
[1:31:21] mango that you couldn't get up through
[1:31:23] the straw if you had a normal straw so
[1:31:24] this is full of mango and it's only like
[1:31:27] a dollar American it'd be about $10 over
[1:31:30] here for that much mango juice but um
