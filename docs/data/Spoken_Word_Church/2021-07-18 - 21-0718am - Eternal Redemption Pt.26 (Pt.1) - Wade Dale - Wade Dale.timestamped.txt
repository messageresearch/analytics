[10:28] amen all right hebrews 9 verse 11 says
[10:31] but christ being coming high priests of
[10:33] good things to come
[10:35] by a greater more perfect tabernacle not
[10:37] made with hands that is to say
[10:39] not of this building neither by the
[10:41] blood of goats and calves but by his own
[10:43] blood he entered in once
[10:45] into the holy place having obtained
[10:47] eternal redemption for us
[10:49] and him entering in as i read the
[10:51] scripture on grace
[10:52] we can now enter in cambodia to the
[10:55] throne of grace
[10:57] now let's go to amos 3 verse 7.
[11:00] and 8 surely the lord will do nothing
[11:06] everybody got that this is the lord
[11:08] saying
[11:09] he's going to do nothing
[11:12] but he revealeth his secrets unto his
[11:14] servants the prophets
[11:15] so he's got to have a prophet that he
[11:17] can speak through not
[11:19] not 40 different
[11:23] as we're going to look in just a minute
[11:24] not 400 prophets of baal that went up to
[11:28] i mean you know come on now there was
[11:30] one elijah stood on that mountain by
[11:32] himself
[11:33] amen amen all right his servants the
[11:36] prophets the lion hath roared who will
[11:37] not fear the lord god hath spoken
[11:40] who can but prophesy and let's read
[11:42] revelations 11 verse 3
[11:44] and i will give power unto my two
[11:46] witnesses they shall prophesy a thousand
[11:48] two hundred
[11:49] three score days for those of you that
[11:51] don't know that's 1260 days
[11:53] clothed in sackcloth you may be seated
[11:55] in the lord as blessing
[11:57] the reading of the word now what we're
[11:58] going to do just for a moment
[12:01] is we're going to cover i we talked
[12:04] about this you know a couple weeks ago
[12:06] in the jubilee
[12:07] and we wonder sometimes why things
[12:10] happen
[12:11] everything happens for a purpose and
[12:14] there's nothing new under the sun
[12:16] there's nothing that that got god all
[12:19] nervous he knew exactly what was going
[12:20] on before the foundation of the world
[12:23] and have you ever thought about this
[12:27] we would know nothing of a man named job
[12:31] until god brought his attention
[12:34] to the devil
[12:38] nothing was written of job except well
[12:41] we had a family and he had
[12:42] you know had animals and but nothing
[12:46] happened to job until god brought his
[12:49] attention
[12:50] to the devil that's what i was trying to
[12:53] think you know we were
[12:56] many times a couple of weeks ago we were
[12:58] bragging a little bit you know
[13:00] and we were only bragging on god you
[13:02] know that
[13:04] but it brought the attention to the
[13:05] devil i'm sure
[13:09] he said they're bragging a little too
[13:10] much
[13:12] god said well okay have you considered
[13:15] my
[13:16] spoken word church up there in lula
[13:17] georgia amen
[13:21] but remember whatever happened to job
[13:24] christ came on the scene
[13:28] elihu came on the scene the fourth man
[13:30] in the fire
[13:32] not the three accusers i'm not going to
[13:33] worry about them
[13:37] but illegal came on the scene and he
[13:38] said listen to what i'm saying
[13:40] and job stood up and he job finally said
[13:43] i know my redeemer lives
[13:46] and the end of job remember was greater
[13:48] than the beginning
[13:50] he was restored two-fold amen so let's
[13:53] take that as
[13:55] not having the spirit of fear right
[13:58] but of love and a sound mind i like
[13:59] brother ernie always quoted that
[14:01] scripture
[14:02] not having the spirit of fear
[14:06] and we're going to continue on as we are
[14:09] amen try not to skip a beat
[14:13] we'll do the best we can with what we
[14:14] got but
[14:17] we like to brag on god amen
[14:20] and bragging on god sometimes you have
[14:23] to prove it
[14:25] and that's what we're doing now amen
[14:28] we're proving
[14:29] that we know who our redeemer is and
[14:32] christ did come on the scene
[14:35] and if you'll read there where christ
[14:37] tells job all the different things he
[14:39] tells him then you can see that that's
[14:40] christ talking to me and you
[14:41] i don't have time to go through that i
[14:42] just wanted to interject that and also
[14:46] we were looking at the jubilee now the
[14:49] jubilee was two
[14:50] weeks ago in the 50th year
[14:53] so let's turn to leviticus or they'll
[14:55] pull it up on the screen i kind of want
[14:56] to bring this out i've been impressed
[14:59] to speak on this also but i just want to
[15:01] put this in as a snippet this morning
[15:05] we always talk about the jubilee year
[15:07] what all the different things will
[15:08] happen i'm going to cover it just a few
[15:09] minutes if that's okay
[15:11] because this part of redemption anyway
[15:13] now look leviticus 25 verse 8 it says
[15:16] thou shalt number seven
[15:18] sabbath of years unto thee seven
[15:21] times seven years because real short
[15:24] in the old testament there was a release
[15:27] every seven years you worked six years
[15:29] in its seventh year
[15:30] there was a release but it was not a
[15:33] release to where everything went free
[15:36] only certain things there were
[15:38] requirements you had to meet
[15:40] in the church ages or in the seven years
[15:43] amen
[15:44] certain requirements that you had to
[15:46] meet if
[15:48] and and they're all you can read them in
[15:49] there if you marry a wife but if he
[15:51] gives you a wife she's got to stay
[15:52] because see you can't take your family
[15:54] out totally until that 50th jubilee
[15:58] now think about that think about what we
[16:01] in two weeks ago
[16:02] what we entered we entered the jubilee
[16:05] not the seven
[16:06] sevens we entered the golden jubilee the
[16:09] 50th year that has never been before
[16:13] it has never been um in israel
[16:16] or in the jewish part they've never had
[16:18] a 50 jubilee
[16:20] they've never they've done the seven
[16:21] sevens but listen let's watch this
[16:24] and that shall be forty and nine years
[16:26] so every seven years there was a release
[16:28] it was a partial release though not a
[16:30] complete release
[16:32] if i got that say amen stay with me just
[16:34] a minute
[16:35] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[16:38] jubilee to
[16:39] sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[16:41] month
[16:42] in the day of atonement shall you make
[16:44] the trumpet sound
[16:45] throughout all your land now look
[16:47] leviticus 25
[16:48] 10 and you shall hallow the 50th year so
[16:52] 7-7-49 you got to go that one more
[16:55] year to celebrate that jubilee now
[16:58] remember
[16:59] that jubilee though let me show you what
[17:01] happens and he shall hallow the 50th
[17:03] year
[17:04] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[17:06] land and to
[17:07] all the inhabitants thereof it shall be
[17:10] a jubilee unto you
[17:12] talking about the jewish people and you
[17:14] shall return
[17:15] every man unto his possession right
[17:18] whatever the devil
[17:20] took away from you god's going to bring
[17:21] back because watch what happens
[17:23] and you shall return every man
[17:27] unto his family you didn't have that
[17:30] promise under 7
[17:31] 7. you could partially go
[17:35] how many times have we claimed our
[17:36] family how many times are we
[17:39] still claiming our family well
[17:42] maybe we were under a 49 and they
[17:44] couldn't go free
[17:48] but we're not under 49 anymore
[17:51] a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be
[17:54] unto you you shall not sow
[17:58] neither reap that's what's growth of
[18:00] itself nor gather the grapes
[18:03] and it of thy vine undressed in other
[18:05] words
[18:06] you're not going to plan anything you're
[18:08] going to live off what you had
[18:11] the previous years
[18:17] for it is the jubilee it shall be holy
[18:19] unto you you shall eat the
[18:21] increase thereof out of the field
[18:24] so whatever's been planted in this
[18:26] church for 50 years we're going to live
[18:29] off of that
[18:30] amen that's what we're living off of
[18:33] we're going to live off
[18:34] that what's already been planted
[18:38] listen i can't bring you nothing new you
[18:40] can't bring another preacher in here and
[18:41] bring you nothing
[18:42] new they hadn't already been preached
[18:45] all right you shall eat the increase
[18:47] thereof of the field in the year of this
[18:49] you
[18:50] jubilee you shall return every man
[18:53] unto his possession everything
[18:57] brother branham said they would watch on
[18:58] top of that mountain and said
[19:00] jubilee he said you throw down your hole
[19:03] you go get your family and you go back
[19:05] to freedom
[19:08] in the seven sevens you had to leave
[19:10] somebody there or you had to leave part
[19:12] of your possession there's all that
[19:13] leviticus and exodus all those different
[19:15] ones
[19:16] you can read that but let's read this
[19:19] just a little snippet and we'll get
[19:20] started on eternal
[19:21] redemption look in leviticus 25 54 says
[19:24] if he be not redeemed in these years
[19:28] then he shall go out in the year of do
[19:30] you believe both
[19:31] he and his children
[19:35] with him now if you've claimed your
[19:38] children all these years
[19:39] this is the year you're going to see
[19:42] them come
[19:43] you better believe that because that is
[19:46] our year of jubilee where everything can
[19:49] go free
[19:49] well mike there you go with your laundry
[19:52] list
[19:56] my kids can't because well they probably
[19:59] said the same thing about you your mom
[20:00] and daddy but no they didn't they said
[20:02] no i'm
[20:02] these are my kids
[20:06] so let's look at that all of us we all
[20:08] have
[20:10] kids that have been put in bondage
[20:14] under that 49 that's been put in bondage
[20:17] but here we come we give a promise
[20:19] that the 50th year that you can take all
[20:21] your children and go free
[20:24] but let me warn you about something too
[20:28] let's go to the book of exodus exodus 21
[20:31] verse 5 if you want to just stay the way
[20:33] you are
[20:35] if you just want to stay the way you are
[20:37] you didn't have to go out in that 50th
[20:39] year
[20:40] [Applause]
[20:42] you made a choice on that 50th year
[20:46] whether to go free
[20:48] or what and if the servant shall plainly
[20:50] say i love my master
[20:52] my wife and my children what did jesus
[20:54] tell us
[20:55] he said if you can't forsake father
[20:58] mother
[20:59] sister and brother you'll have no part
[21:01] with me now not to do away with them you
[21:03] understand but do not put them first you
[21:05] put god first
[21:06] then you claim your wife you claim your
[21:08] children you can't claim your wife and
[21:10] children if you don't have god first
[21:13] you got to have the baptism of holy
[21:14] ghost you got to have something to feed
[21:16] off of
[21:17] you got to have something for god to
[21:18] come to
[21:20] the new birth don't claim your children
[21:23] when you need to be claimed yourself
[21:26] i know that hurts but shake it up folks
[21:33] see that's what's happened when this
[21:35] jubilee you say well no
[21:36] no yes yes i believe we're in that 50th
[21:39] jubilee
[21:40] where we can claim everything we got and
[21:42] we can go free
[21:43] now look what happens though i will not
[21:46] go out free
[21:48] then his master shall bring him unto the
[21:50] judges and he shall also bring him to
[21:51] the door
[21:52] unto the doorpost and his master shall
[21:54] bore his ear through with an awl
[21:57] and he shall serve him forever
[22:00] let's don't go back let's don't stand
[22:03] say this is status quo this is good
[22:05] enough yeah we
[22:06] we're going to be status quo as far as
[22:07] running the church and all the different
[22:09] things
[22:10] because that's the way it's been set up
[22:13] but let's don't say this is the end this
[22:15] is we're done we're finished no we're
[22:17] not
[22:17] this is the jubilee go free from that
[22:21] old master
[22:23] and claim your family and and it didn't
[22:25] say he claimed his family
[22:27] and then they came later turn it back
[22:30] down to the next one
[22:31] i mean the one before that
[22:36] if he not be redeemed his years then he
[22:38] shall go out in the year of jubilee
[22:40] both he and his children with him
[22:44] he grabbed his family and he took them
[22:47] out from under that bondage and they
[22:48] went free
[22:49] and they were able to be restored
[22:53] and that's what i'm looking for folks
[22:56] i'm looking for a restoration
[23:00] of whatever god wants to bring us if he
[23:03] wants to bring us gifts
[23:04] prophecy he's already brought us good
[23:06] preaching
[23:07] we've got a good foundation the jubilee
[23:10] year is on folks it's not that we're
[23:12] going to have
[23:12] some new something but we're going to
[23:16] eat of the old corn of the land we're
[23:17] going to eat what's already been
[23:18] established here
[23:20] and that's the way we're going to eat
[23:22] and we're going to eat that way from
[23:23] sunday to sunday
[23:25] until brother dale's ready to come back
[23:26] in here
[23:28] and put the harness on hey man
[23:31] and that's just the way it is if you
[23:33] have any questions or comments
[23:35] there are some things that that we may
[23:37] do i'm thinking about maybe bringing
[23:39] some
[23:40] ministers in maybe once a month to just
[23:43] kind of help us with some outside
[23:45] you know bring some outside people in a
[23:46] little bit brother hyatt's coming this
[23:48] week
[23:50] brother andrew glover's coming in
[23:52] september so we may just do that but
[23:56] we'll take counsel i want you to
[23:58] remember the deacons elders and
[23:59] ministers of this church are all
[24:00] together in one
[24:02] amen and we'll stay together amen and if
[24:05] there's anything that needs to be
[24:07] um any something hard or harsh it needs
[24:10] to be taken care of
[24:11] we still got a pastor
[24:15] god will give us the right
[24:19] thing to do amen so let's not have the
[24:21] spirit of fear let's just pray for
[24:23] brother dale pray for all of us
[24:25] and we'll continue on and listen we're
[24:27] in a jubilee year
[24:30] listen we're not going back if you go
[24:32] back you're gonna get bored in the air
[24:33] and you're just gonna get bored
[24:35] that's right hey man it's just it's
[24:38] gonna bore you
[24:40] but let's just not let it borrow us okay
[24:42] amen
[24:43] if you have any questions or concerns
[24:46] just
[24:47] please feel free to uh to contact us or
[24:51] we we're praying for brother dale
[24:52] praying for mom that and kind of keep it
[24:55] to where he can recover and
[24:59] we can already see that that he he's
[25:02] here
[25:04] all right so let's turn to the book of
[25:05] revelations and as we were talking
[25:08] i just want to kind of get that out of
[25:09] the way because i don't want
[25:11] there's always you know there's a devil
[25:13] there he's always throwing stuff in your
[25:15] mind
[25:17] and sometimes you say why well i don't
[25:20] think job
[25:21] job might or not said why
[25:24] but when he got to the end i'm sure job
[25:26] said man i know i had to go through that
[25:29] for god to give me what he gave me he
[25:31] gave me my life and gave me twice
[25:34] what i had before so so where i'm
[25:36] looking for a double portion are you not
[25:38] looking for a double portion
[25:40] i'm looking for a double porsche
[25:42] whatever god's got
[25:43] double it and that what elisha asked for
[25:47] when elijah left he said i want a double
[25:49] portion now brother brown said he lies
[25:50] to top the bride
[25:51] so the bride needs to call for a double
[25:54] portion
[25:56] to be on us it's listen it's going to
[25:57] take that double portion to get us out
[25:59] of here remember grace grace
[26:01] it's going to take grace grace to get us
[26:02] out of here amen
[26:05] so now let's continue on i've been
[26:09] studying a little bit more and like i
[26:11] said before there's been some
[26:13] new ones with questions and that's great
[26:14] and wonderful i really enjoy that
[26:16] it makes the church bind together more
[26:20] even when certain things happen and and
[26:22] people have questions and
[26:24] as i wrote if you'll pull back up let's
[26:26] pull back up amos and read that again
[26:29] surely the lord god will do nothing now
[26:31] look he'll do nothing
[26:33] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[26:36] servants the prophets
[26:38] so like i said before the prophet we
[26:40] know the
[26:41] prophet's the lord jesus christ the
[26:44] prophet's the word of god
[26:46] but it has to speak when you bring a
[26:47] prophet on the scene he has to speak
[26:51] right every prophet you've you've seen
[26:54] in the old testament they've had to
[26:55] speak something
[26:57] they didn't just come on the scene well
[26:58] now here's elijah
[27:06] elijah died
[27:09] what would that have good done any good
[27:11] no elijah
[27:12] shows up and starts prophesying
[27:16] we had nothing else of him in the past
[27:18] either like job you didn't hear him
[27:19] nothing until he comes up and says
[27:21] elijah the tishbite walks up to the
[27:24] woman and says give me some of that meal
[27:28] and some of that flour but he revealeth
[27:31] his secret
[27:32] unto his servants the prophet the lion
[27:34] hath roared who will not fear the lord
[27:36] god hath spoken who can but prophesy
[27:38] so now let's go to exit let's go to
[27:40] revelations one
[27:43] we know that's the seven church ages and
[27:44] the seven golden candlesticks
[27:46] so let's go down to verse 20 for save
[27:48] time
[27:50] we're going to continue on this this
[27:51] afternoon
[27:53] and try to get down to a place the
[27:55] mystery of the seven stars which i saw
[27:57] to my right hand and the seven golden
[27:59] candlesticks the seven stars are the
[28:00] angels
[28:01] of the seven churches in the seven
[28:02] candlesticks was thou south
[28:04] are the seven churches so there has got
[28:06] to be
[28:08] after the death of jesus christ there is
[28:10] a gentile bride taken out
[28:13] and there is seven church ages and seven
[28:16] spirits that are given
[28:21] prophets stars
[28:25] messengers from god if you want to look
[28:26] at the greek lexicon when you look at
[28:28] those stars it's a messenger
[28:30] from god now see you can have
[28:35] as i there's a lot of contention not in
[28:37] not in the message you're not not the
[28:39] true message believers but it's just
[28:40] contention now that they say that
[28:42] brother branham fed off clarence larkin
[28:44] and he used this and he used this one
[28:46] and he
[28:47] he fed off of this one well so do we
[28:52] listen the difference in clarence larkin
[28:54] listen i believe god spoke to clarence
[28:56] larkin just
[28:57] like he spoke to dwight moody just like
[28:59] he spoke to calvin
[29:01] finney all those different great men god
[29:03] spoke to them because they were
[29:06] part part of the ministry of the age
[29:11] but they weren't confirmed prophets that
[29:13] you could put in the bible
[29:16] you see clarence larkin had a message
[29:18] from god because listen
[29:19] the baptist had the word of god when in
[29:21] the beginning when the smith brothers or
[29:23] whoever it was
[29:24] started there's always been people
[29:27] wonder and
[29:28] say why do you have to listen to what a
[29:30] man says
[29:31] every denomination
[29:35] every thou 13 000 domination started by
[29:39] what one man said
[29:43] so why should it be so strange that we
[29:45] listen to this one that we listen to
[29:48] because he was vindicated in the word of
[29:51] god
[29:53] clarence larkin was not right he was
[29:56] under the age of ministering or being a
[29:58] minister of the gospel
[30:00] and could get revelation from god
[30:03] yes dwight moody brother brown said put
[30:06] millions into the kingdom
[30:10] luther wesley
[30:14] but there was no one
[30:17] clarence larkin had a revelation but he
[30:20] didn't have a message
[30:22] that was tied to the bible personal
[30:26] because you're going to read it right
[30:27] here malachi 4.
[30:31] behold i will send you elijah the
[30:33] prophet
[30:34] before the coming of the great and
[30:35] dreadful day of the lord
[30:37] and there's something he's going to do
[30:38] see like i said didn't you send elijah
[30:41] and
[30:42] silence no no and he shall turn the
[30:46] heart of the fathers to the children and
[30:47] the heart of the children to the fathers
[30:49] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[30:52] curse so it wasn't malachi
[30:56] 3 and the first part of malachi 4 was
[30:58] john the baptist we know that right
[31:00] because the great and dreadful day of
[31:01] the lord did not come
[31:04] back when jesus was here and then we
[31:06] read last sunday we'll read it again
[31:07] matthew 17
[31:09] and his disciples ask him saying why
[31:10] then say the scribes that elish or
[31:12] elijah
[31:13] must first come they're looking for
[31:15] elijah over in in
[31:17] jerusalem because of malachi 4.
[31:23] because that's their last book in their
[31:24] bible they don't have a new testament
[31:27] and jesus answered and said unto them
[31:29] elias or elijah
[31:31] truly shall first come and restore all
[31:34] things
[31:36] the first elijah we'll read it in just a
[31:38] minute in kings we turn to it now
[31:41] the first elijah had to restore an altar
[31:46] the third elijah was to what
[31:49] to proclaim the coming of the messiah
[31:54] the fourth coming of elijah is to
[31:56] restore
[31:57] all things because remember when the
[31:59] fifth elijah goes that doesn't restore
[32:01] all things that only restores jerusalem
[32:04] so we had to have a gentile prophet
[32:08] hello somebody a gentile prophet for all
[32:12] nations
[32:13] that's why even i was reading yesterday
[32:15] brother branham so much wanted to go to
[32:17] israel to take that sign
[32:20] he'd have broke every scripture in the
[32:22] bible if he would have went over there
[32:24] the rapture would have took place for
[32:26] the jews if he'd have went over there
[32:29] god said no you can't go it's not
[32:32] ready yet but i think maybe he whispered
[32:35] in his ear and said
[32:36] you're not going physically but i'm
[32:37] going to send your message over there
[32:39] amen i'm going to send your message over
[32:41] there
[32:42] and he was satisfied with that amen but
[32:45] let's look in first kings
[32:46] let's read this it's kind of long
[32:47] reading but
[32:49] it's okay i like reading the bible and
[32:52] elijah son of the prophets of baal now
[32:54] this is elijah this is the restorer this
[32:56] is the first elijah
[32:58] the pattern elijah remember you always
[33:01] got to have a pattern elijah the first
[33:03] elijah was the pattern elijah and elijah
[33:06] said under the prophets of baal
[33:09] 400 of them
[33:12] it took 400 of them they thought
[33:16] to get bail on the scene to get all them
[33:18] denominational oh nevermind
[33:22] because they were all false choose you
[33:26] one bullet for yourself in other words
[33:27] elijah didn't jump
[33:28] and say look i'm the man of the hour
[33:30] i'll choose the bullock i'll choose
[33:31] where it goes no he said
[33:32] issues you choose to battle ground
[33:37] you choose for yourself and dress it
[33:39] first for a year or many
[33:42] 400 of them 400 preachers standing on a
[33:45] mountain
[33:47] against one man
[33:51] kind of like them 300 preachers in
[33:52] chicago
[33:55] stood up to elijah one time and had a
[33:58] mount carmel experience calling the name
[34:00] of your gods
[34:01] gods but put no fire under
[34:05] and they took the bullock which was
[34:07] given them and they dressed it
[34:09] called on the name of baal from morning
[34:11] till noon
[34:12] saying oh baal hear us but there was no
[34:15] voice
[34:17] their prophet had no voice
[34:21] they're trying to call something on the
[34:23] scene that has no voice
[34:25] has no message think about this
[34:30] and they dressed it up and called on the
[34:31] name of baal from morning till noon
[34:33] saying oh they'll hear us but there was
[34:34] no voice
[34:36] nor any of that answered
[34:39] and they what leaped on the altar
[34:42] which was made in other words by the
[34:45] time they got finished with this thing
[34:47] it was a bloody mess because remember
[34:48] we're going to read they started
[34:49] slitting each other and they started
[34:51] bleeding and they started stomping the
[34:53] altar what they got kind of mad i guess
[34:55] i'm sorry
[34:56] their god didn't show up and it came to
[34:59] pass at noon that elijah mocked them
[35:02] and said cry loud for he's a god
[35:07] either he's talking or he's in other
[35:08] words he's someone's on vacation maybe
[35:10] you need to find a college secretary
[35:12] or he is in a journey or pre-adventure
[35:14] he's asleep
[35:16] and he must be awakened and they cried
[35:18] aloud and cut themselves
[35:20] after their manner with knives and
[35:22] lances till the blood
[35:24] gushed listen
[35:27] at least there was one thing for sure
[35:30] they were dedicated amen
[35:34] give them that much credit they were
[35:35] dead they took their denominational idea
[35:39] to the extreme
[35:43] would you but you don't have to
[35:47] and it came to pass when midday was
[35:49] passed
[35:50] and they prophesied until the time of
[35:52] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[35:55] so has to be in the evening time it's
[35:58] when god's going to show up
[36:00] there was neither voice nor in other
[36:02] words there was silence for all day
[36:06] nor any of it regarded and elijah said
[36:08] unto all the people
[36:09] now remember there was 400 prophets and
[36:11] then there had to be people
[36:15] because remember at the very end of this
[36:16] thing they take them 400 prophets down
[36:18] to the book kidro
[36:19] brook kidron and kill every one of them
[36:22] wow okay so they had to be herded up
[36:26] by what the congregation that saw who
[36:28] was right and who was wrong
[36:31] and elijah said unto all the people come
[36:33] near unto me
[36:35] and all the people came near unto him
[36:36] and he repaired the altar
[36:38] see there's the restoration he repaired
[36:40] the altar
[36:42] he put the stones back he put the wood
[36:46] in order watch and elijah took 12 stones
[36:48] according to the number of the tribes of
[36:49] the sons of jacob remember he was a
[36:51] prophet in the old testament unto whom
[36:53] the word of the lord came
[36:55] saying israel shall be thy name and with
[36:57] the stones
[36:59] what's the stone thrones of revelation
[37:03] he brought he restored the revelation
[37:05] back to the way it was supposed to be
[37:07] and with the stones he built an altar
[37:09] in the name of the lord not baal and not
[37:13] in the name of lords
[37:16] am i shouting too hard for you okay
[37:19] and with the stones he built an altar in
[37:21] the name of the lord and he made a
[37:22] trench about the altars greatest would
[37:23] contain two measures of seed
[37:25] and he put the wood in order he's
[37:28] putting everything back in order he
[37:30] he's not just gonna walk up and say well
[37:31] this is a bloody mess but i'm gonna call
[37:33] the lord
[37:33] no he put everything back in order he
[37:35] restored it
[37:36] to where it looked like before they when
[37:39] they first walked up there
[37:40] all right so in other words that elijah
[37:42] was a restorer of the word a restorer of
[37:45] the stone
[37:45] and the wood he cut the sacrifice in
[37:49] pieces
[37:50] laid him on the wood and he said fill
[37:52] four barrels with water
[37:54] and pour it on the burnt sacrificing on
[37:55] the wood and he said do it a second time
[38:00] first pull second pull
[38:04] hallelujah
[38:07] and they did what he said here's the key
[38:11] somebody what the prophets of baal i'm
[38:14] sure they're standing over there trying
[38:15] to clean themselves up after
[38:17] cutting herself to pieces they're not
[38:19] over there helping elijah
[38:20] it's the congregation that got a
[38:22] revelation that maybe this guy elijah
[38:25] has something about him that them 400
[38:27] pieces of preachers denominational
[38:28] preachers don't have
[38:31] do it a second time and they did it the
[38:33] second time he said do it a third time
[38:37] it took the third pull they did it a
[38:40] third time
[38:41] and all the water talk about washed by
[38:44] the water of the word
[38:45] that water run all the way down they
[38:48] want no fire nowhere to be seen i'm sure
[38:50] the bales are
[38:51] prophets of bale are going how many
[38:53] gallons of water
[38:54] is he going to pour on that
[39:00] it came to pass at the time of the
[39:02] offering of the evening sacrifice
[39:05] so now we're in the evening time that
[39:09] elijah the prophet came there
[39:13] he came to me and you because he said
[39:14] behold i send you
[39:16] elijah the prophet he said lord god of
[39:19] abraham isaac of israel
[39:21] and of israel let it be known this day
[39:24] that thou
[39:24] art god in israel not god's
[39:29] and that i am thy servant look and i
[39:31] have done all these things
[39:33] at thy word
[39:36] brother preach the sermon after our word
[39:39] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[39:43] may know that thou art the lord god and
[39:45] that thou hast what
[39:48] turned their heart
[39:52] back again
[39:56] did malachi 4 say amen malachi 4 had
[39:59] turned heart of the fathers to the
[40:00] children children to the fathers here
[40:02] elijah said lord that thou has turned
[40:04] their heart
[40:05] back again in other words away from
[40:07] those prophets of baal
[40:09] because they're fixing to take them as
[40:10] you continue to read on which we're not
[40:12] going to read on
[40:14] the congregation takes those 400
[40:16] prophets
[40:17] down to the brook and kill all 400 of
[40:22] them
[40:25] so you can take bail all you want to
[40:28] i'll take god
[40:30] i'll take god in the prophet that he
[40:32] sent that turned my heart back
[40:34] because look malachi 4 read it again
[40:36] behold i will send you elijah
[40:38] the prophet before the coming of the
[40:39] great and dreadful day of the lord now
[40:40] talk about this elijah
[40:44] it's obvious this is the first one this
[40:47] is back in the old testament
[40:48] but he's sending this prophet before the
[40:50] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[40:51] the lord
[40:52] folks if you don't know the coming of
[40:53] the lord's near
[40:57] you're deceived right
[41:01] listen
[41:04] every day we get closer to the coming of
[41:08] the lord whether you believe it or not
[41:12] and he shall turn the heart of the
[41:13] fathers to the children
[41:15] the heart of the children to their
[41:16] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[41:20] with a curse
[41:23] there's our prophet that's going to turn
[41:27] us back
[41:29] lord thou hast turn their heart
[41:32] back again to what to the faith that was
[41:35] once delivered to the
[41:36] saints to the original there was no
[41:38] doctrine
[41:39] besides the doctrine of god in the first
[41:42] two or three ages there was no
[41:43] denomination sure there were spirits
[41:47] but there was no baptist on this corner
[41:49] methods on this corner and pen
[41:50] they can't all be right god can't be
[41:53] that confused
[41:54] if not he would have took him 400
[41:56] prophets and says okay you go set you up
[41:58] a church over there and you take about
[41:59] 20 of them you go search your church
[42:00] over there
[42:01] you take about 20 of those and you get
[42:02] you a leader and you're going to set you
[42:04] 20.
[42:05] uh-uh elijah said i only
[42:09] i only am a prophet i only am thy
[42:12] servant
[42:13] sent from god and what about elijah
[42:17] then we know what he'd done all during
[42:18] his life he restored the shunamite woman
[42:21] in elisha
[42:22] and jezebel was cursed so we know the
[42:25] two women
[42:27] that malachi or the prophet elijah had
[42:30] to deal with we already preached on that
[42:31] so let's go to number one
[42:33] and read it we got to get to the two
[42:36] prophets somewhere but see we got to
[42:37] establish
[42:39] we got to establish that profits are
[42:41] what we need
[42:44] go back to amos he'll do nothing
[42:49] nothing until he reveals it to his
[42:51] servants the prophet first
[42:53] he's got to give it to them first that's
[42:55] right even in my even in revelations 10
[42:58] 7 he had to give it to the revelations
[43:01] 10 7 had to say but in the days of the
[43:03] voice of the seventh angel when he
[43:04] begins to sound
[43:05] the mystery of god to be finished and
[43:07] then john takes the book
[43:10] there had to be a voice of a prophet in
[43:13] the end time
[43:14] there's a voice of a prophet in every
[43:16] age
[43:17] but like i said before clarence larkin
[43:19] some of the different ones they had
[43:21] pieces
[43:24] okay that's not bad
[43:27] it come from god
[43:30] but he didn't he wasn't identified just
[43:32] like we can identify
[43:34] this prophet william branham
[43:37] in the scripture and the life that he
[43:40] had
[43:41] was totally the life of elijah
[43:45] a woodsman he hated women bad women he
[43:48] didn't hate good women he was married to
[43:50] one i don't see how people understand
[43:51] stuff like that
[43:53] well he hated women no he married one
[43:58] and then that one died he married
[43:59] another one it wasn't he was so against
[44:01] women
[44:02] had a couple of girls himself i don't
[44:03] see why people don't
[44:05] it was the bad one it's always the bad
[44:08] he didn't rebuke a congregation up there
[44:10] he rebuked him 400 prophets of baal
[44:12] right right right that's right now this
[44:16] message of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7
[44:18] is going to do two things one according
[44:19] to malachi 4 i just read he will turn
[44:21] the hearts of the children
[44:22] what children pentecostal babies to the
[44:24] fathers in other words restore us back
[44:26] to where there was no denomination
[44:29] there was no denominational idea in
[44:31] peter james john
[44:32] paul all the different apostles in the
[44:36] new testament
[44:37] they didn't have a denominational idea
[44:41] it was developed because it became a
[44:44] saying a deed and a doctrine we
[44:46] understand that through the seals
[44:48] and that's how satan he goes in real
[44:50] slow
[44:52] a saying well i don't know if he was out
[44:55] there hunting
[44:56] on the day he was supposed to be or not
[44:58] i don't know
[45:00] i don't know that cloud you know they
[45:02] said maybe it was a
[45:03] you see what i mean but see what that
[45:05] goes to though
[45:07] that goes to a doctrine saying deed
[45:10] doctrine and when it becomes a doctrine
[45:13] people take that as a doctrine then they
[45:14] go away
[45:15] because they have to they can't take the
[45:16] real doctrine
[45:19] give me listen he was a word prophet
[45:22] he revealed the word of god to me and
[45:24] that i do not it doesn't matter like
[45:26] brother dick addison said one time he
[45:27] said
[45:28] i don't care if they find out brother
[45:29] adam had 12 wives
[45:33] and the reason he said we know it didn't
[45:35] but that's an extreme
[45:36] but he brought the word to me that
[45:38] nobody else brought
[45:40] he was a word prophet he brought the
[45:42] word to me and i can understand it
[45:45] and and and we don't have to
[45:48] dwell on all the human things if we
[45:51] dwell on all of our human things we're
[45:53] not going to go anywhere anyway
[45:55] according to malcolm 4 he returned the
[45:57] hearts of the children to the fathers
[46:00] in other words what he said time to
[46:01] loose ends what were the loose ends
[46:04] denominational ideas in other words like
[46:07] i said he said lutheran
[46:08] loose sin is like brother paul you got a
[46:10] cord you got a long cord
[46:13] which is the word of god it's eternal it
[46:15] can't be broken
[46:17] satan comes in and goes there's a
[46:19] trinity
[46:21] there's an eternal hell women
[46:25] it's okay for you to cut your hair well
[46:26] that's just old testament stuff
[46:29] no it's not it's a new testament you see
[46:32] what i mean
[46:32] satan kept cutting those cords of the
[46:34] word he couldn't do away with it he
[46:35] could cut the cord
[46:36] what lose this effect so the loose ends
[46:38] would hang down
[46:40] so what did it take it took a restoring
[46:43] profit
[46:45] not a larkin or a moody they were
[46:48] reformers
[46:49] right it took a restoring profit to what
[46:52] tie the loose ends back together and
[46:56] make it one long cord again
[46:59] so there's no idea that somebody else is
[47:01] i well i have this idea
[47:03] that's okay to have an idea but if it's
[47:05] contrary to the word of god it's just an
[47:07] idea
[47:09] amen so two i hope this is okay it's
[47:13] kind of a refresher course for us but
[47:16] but you know what have you ever sat down
[47:18] and tried to understand why god sent you
[47:19] elijah the prophet
[47:21] you need to sit down somewhere and say
[47:23] why'd you send him to me lord
[47:25] why because we were part of them loose
[47:27] ends actually we were hung by them
[47:35] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[47:36] seven thunders in revelation 10. let's
[47:38] don't get all
[47:40] everybody okay don't say unto trumpet
[47:45] in a minute he will reveal the mysteries
[47:47] of the seven thunders
[47:48] look that's just revelations 10 which
[47:51] are the revelations
[47:52] contained in the seven seals which is
[47:54] not a mystery it's
[47:55] it's written jesus preached them in
[47:57] matthew and you can read them in
[47:58] revelations what
[48:00] six five whatever six some six
[48:03] so you can read them but it took
[48:05] somebody to interpret that
[48:07] because god said also that he would hide
[48:09] it
[48:10] from the wise and prudent but reveal it
[48:13] unto babes such as we'll learn
[48:15] such as will learn
[48:18] it will be these divinely revealed so
[48:21] it's going to take
[48:23] god not a man's idea
[48:27] it will be these divinely revealed
[48:29] mystery truths that literally turn the
[48:30] hearts of the children to the
[48:32] pentecostal fathers exactly so
[48:35] everybody all right with that
[48:39] let's go to number two feast of the
[48:42] trumpets brother brown said now he's
[48:44] been revealed through the church ages
[48:45] now watch through the church ages
[48:47] as the son of god now what did this let
[48:50] me explain this real quick
[48:52] the son of god is a revelation
[48:55] to give you the new birth to change your
[48:59] soul
[48:59] from a sinner to a saint that's what he
[49:02] said he'd do i'll send back the
[49:03] comforter
[49:04] and he will not just come with you he'll
[49:06] come in you all right
[49:08] now that's the son of god he said i will
[49:11] he said you know all the different
[49:12] things he said i'll never leave you i'll
[49:13] never forsake you
[49:14] the world will see me no more but you'll
[49:16] see me all these different things
[49:17] i'll send the comforter back in my name
[49:19] and he'll what leads you and guides you
[49:21] into all truth
[49:22] everybody got that but there was still
[49:25] some loose
[49:26] ends that god winked at the ignorance of
[49:29] man
[49:33] let satan cut the cord to see what you
[49:35] do with it
[49:36] right exactly that's the way i can i can
[49:39] explain it
[49:40] god allowed satan to cut the co and
[49:42] started god never started the
[49:44] denomination
[49:45] ever right right but he allowed satan to
[49:48] do that
[49:50] he just did he allowed him to do it what
[49:52] to see what man would do
[49:56] god being a spirit the holy spirit he
[49:58] revealed himself in the church ages
[50:00] in the congregation as the holy spirit
[50:04] among the people so now we find in the
[50:06] laodicean church age this is revelation
[50:08] 3 14.
[50:13] that remember he said behold i stand at
[50:14] the door knock he was put out of the
[50:16] church
[50:18] why god can't stay in
[50:21] a denominational situation because
[50:24] it's false god's not where false is
[50:28] god's where truth is and he's trying to
[50:31] get back in
[50:33] to the church and they won't let him in
[50:35] no way listen
[50:37] if you let him back in we're gonna have
[50:38] to come on
[50:41] we're gonna do away with our
[50:42] denomination we're gonna have to do away
[50:43] with this we've got to do away with
[50:45] being able to smoke a little bit and
[50:46] drink a little bit and party a little
[50:47] bit and wear what i want to wear not
[50:48] what i want
[50:49] you understand what i mean
[50:53] it's like i said about grace this
[50:55] morning it's the grace of god
[50:59] that i don't do the things i do that i
[51:01] used to do
[51:04] it's the grace of god
[51:07] because you know what yeah be real with
[51:10] yourself
[51:11] sometimes your old self wants to do it
[51:12] again
[51:16] brother boyd put his finger up i think
[51:18] i'll put mine up too i think brother
[51:20] john oh okay right right but it's that
[51:23] tie post it's that thing down inside of
[51:25] you that says
[51:27] amen the things i used to do
[51:31] i do them no more why because there's a
[51:35] different person
[51:36] inside now that's the change i want
[51:39] first
[51:40] then that's going to take me to a body
[51:43] change
[51:44] within the layout of cnas because they
[51:46] said you're rich have need of nothing
[51:47] see you can't talk to people in this age
[51:49] you can't hardly convert get anybody
[51:51] converted or even listen to you
[51:54] hello why because they know it all
[51:59] they got google
[52:08] and know it not i'm reading the bible
[52:10] now this is not man's idea
[52:11] that you're miserable poor
[52:15] naked and blind and don't know it
[52:20] he was put out of the church age then
[52:23] according to luke 17 30
[52:24] he said as it was in the days of sodom
[52:26] lord have we not got one of them
[52:27] conditions here
[52:30] got transgender people running the
[52:31] country and
[52:34] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[52:36] of man now he was reading the same
[52:37] genesis that we read now notice that
[52:39] sodom
[52:40] remember what happened in sodom
[52:43] now let's go to the next one now what is
[52:45] the sign
[52:46] of the son of man because we need that
[52:48] sign of the son of man because in the
[52:49] church ages he was the son of god
[52:51] but the son of man revelation let's go
[52:53] to the next one
[52:55] queen of sheba 1960. jesus said as was
[52:58] in the days of sodom
[53:00] so shall be in the coming of the son of
[53:01] man look at that angel down there to the
[53:04] church
[53:04] elect what he done
[53:09] nobody understand what he's talking
[53:10] about he came to elijah
[53:14] melchizedek and the two angels came to a
[53:16] lot came i'm sorry came to abraham thank
[53:18] you
[53:19] came to abraham right he stayed with
[53:22] abraham
[53:24] now what was that melchizedek was not a
[53:27] spirit
[53:28] that was a man that was god that had put
[53:31] on a little human flesh
[53:33] and talked to his elect abraham what
[53:36] happened to the two
[53:38] prophets
[53:41] they went to israel
[53:45] no they went to the they went to the
[53:46] world he said a modern
[53:48] billy graham and oral roberts see there
[53:51] a lot of people have bashed them too but
[53:53] i'm telling you they're identified in
[53:55] the scripture too they're not major
[53:56] prophets
[53:57] but brother brown said they were come to
[53:59] pray to blind the eyes of the gentiles
[54:02] right and bring in listen these people
[54:05] were saved and gonna be in the
[54:06] in in the in heaven that was converts of
[54:09] billy graham and oral roberts
[54:13] he sure got lot and his wife out part of
[54:15] the way his wife but he sure got them
[54:17] out of sodom
[54:18] right the two the two prophets that went
[54:20] down there
[54:22] what are you trying to say listen we we
[54:25] harp on
[54:26] we don't heart but we know that william
[54:27] brown was a prophet but he was a prophet
[54:29] to a bride
[54:31] because everybody else that turned him
[54:33] down he's condemned them
[54:35] it's condemnation to turn it down
[54:38] but now i don't mean that you're damned
[54:40] to hell
[54:44] there's going to be people being given
[54:47] eternal life
[54:49] if you'll really think about it there's
[54:51] going to be if it's one in a million
[54:54] look how many more people that's going
[54:56] to be on this earth
[54:58] not as bride but as eternal people
[55:00] there's going to be way more than they
[55:02] are us
[55:03] way more by millions no by billions
[55:08] by billions there's going to be more
[55:10] people that are given eternal life
[55:12] or that are justified and died you've
[55:13] got children that don't make it to the
[55:14] age of accountability
[55:16] man the world's going to be populated
[55:17] that city is where you and i are going
[55:20] to live just for the bride
[55:22] and it's a very small part of the earth
[55:24] amen so let's don't think we're so great
[55:26] now yeah we are great because god told
[55:28] us we're great but we're not the only
[55:29] ones that's going to be there it's not
[55:30] us for
[55:31] no more what are you saying brother
[55:34] these people i'm not damning nobody
[55:37] that's not my job
[55:39] i'm just telling you that me and you
[55:41] though have been given a grace
[55:43] i have been given an opportunity for god
[55:45] to open the word up that he's never
[55:46] opened to anybody else
[55:50] and he knows you'll take it or not he
[55:53] knows you'll take it or not
[55:56] he said look down here at this
[55:57] generation what he's doing now they'll
[55:59] receive a sign
[56:01] but they won't believe it there you are
[56:04] but it come just the same and evil and
[56:06] adulterous generation will seek after a
[56:08] sign
[56:09] and they'll have it it'll be given to
[56:11] them as jonah was in the belly of the
[56:12] whale three days and three now what
[56:14] resurrection
[56:16] the sign that we were given in the end
[56:18] time is a resurrection sign
[56:22] nobody had ever been able to stand
[56:27] night upon night for 30 years
[56:31] and tell the people what they did two
[56:33] years ago
[56:35] what doctor they went to what color
[56:37] clothes they had on
[56:38] what house number they lived at nobody
[56:42] was able to do that now maybe in
[56:44] part people prophesied but there was a
[56:47] man stood there
[56:48] in a prayer line and he said i saw you
[56:51] yesterday sitting on the side of a bed
[56:52] you had on a red dress
[56:54] and the doctor was blond-headed and had
[56:55] on glasses now what was he looking at
[57:01] god had inhabited a man so much
[57:09] god had inhabited a man he had moved
[57:11] over so much
[57:13] to where one day even in a prayer line
[57:15] remember
[57:16] he said this is not the voice of william
[57:18] branham
[57:23] but it was there was no change in the
[57:27] voice
[57:29] listen to your tape it's like 1959.
[57:32] he's in a prayer line or or they're
[57:33] praising the lord he said this is not
[57:36] the voice of william branham this is the
[57:38] voice of god
[57:40] but it never changed it didn't go this
[57:42] is god
[57:43] talking now no it was brother brown's
[57:46] voice he had moved over so much
[57:50] so we got a resurrection signed where a
[57:52] man say you've got cancers on your left
[57:54] breast
[57:56] and you saw a doctor yesterday you live
[57:58] at one two three four
[58:00] west so-and-so street
[58:03] amen oh i see you
[58:06] you're with a man and he's got a
[58:08] headache
[58:10] and he's got cancer and they know y'all
[58:12] you're praying for your son and your
[58:14] son's got so-and-so and he's over at the
[58:15] hospital
[58:16] heavenly days nobody's ever done that
[58:19] except jesus himself
[58:22] our resurrection sign that you can do
[58:25] that too
[58:26] [Music]
[58:27] you can do now listen there was one sign
[58:29] that he had
[58:30] that he could stand there night after
[58:32] night and declare
[58:35] that god was there he said i can't do
[58:37] anything until he comes
[58:39] well there was a prophet of the hour
[58:40] they had the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:43] a manifested son of god and he still had
[58:45] to wait on something right
[58:46] he had to wait on an anointing he had to
[58:49] wait on that anointing of what
[58:51] he's here because he's the one that's
[58:55] going to talk to you
[58:56] right i'm just going to move out of the
[58:58] way
[58:59] he said it's a gear remember he says the
[59:01] gear that i get in
[59:03] well you know what it's a gear to get
[59:04] out of the way we need to get in that
[59:07] gear
[59:09] but the resurrection will be the sign
[59:12] now remember
[59:13] we see jesus when he was here he said i
[59:16] am the resurrection and the life
[59:18] never went to a funeral i wonder how
[59:19] many people were raised from the dead in
[59:21] brother brown's ministry and there's no
[59:22] telling how many
[59:24] there's so many ever how many documented
[59:25] cases but how many that's undocumented
[59:28] why he the son of man was there
[59:32] it was god in human flesh now remember
[59:33] brother brown wasn't the son of man we
[59:36] spoke that again he was a son of man
[59:38] yielding himself so that this son of man
[59:40] could take over
[59:42] and remember it was never wrong
[59:47] never wrong always was right
[59:52] never missed it when i owed them you
[59:54] remember that one time somebody was
[59:55] talking about
[59:56] that after brother brown declared this
[59:58] woman lived at a certain
[1:00:00] street you remember somebody telling
[1:00:02] someone one of the brothers was telling
[1:00:03] about that
[1:00:03] remember that he said oh now brother
[1:00:05] ma'am you missed that said that woman
[1:00:07] lives at so-and-so
[1:00:10] they went back to the woman the woman
[1:00:11] said i moved yesterday you didn't know
[1:00:13] about it
[1:00:14] but god did hallelujah god knew about it
[1:00:17] the woman had moved one day before and
[1:00:19] the man didn't know that the woman moved
[1:00:20] so he thought brother brown that's wrong
[1:00:22] that's where she used to live she said
[1:00:24] no i moved yesterday
[1:00:26] god's never wrong folks if god's wrong
[1:00:28] we need to find somebody else
[1:00:30] to serve but the resurrection will be
[1:00:34] the sign
[1:00:34] and the resurrection this sign is given
[1:00:36] to the church
[1:00:37] in this last day the angel of the holy
[1:00:40] spirit in the meetings
[1:00:41] showing the same thing doing the same
[1:00:43] thing across the nation
[1:00:45] proving that jesus christ is raised from
[1:00:46] the dead just the same yesterday today
[1:00:48] and forever
[1:00:49] that's the generation that will receive
[1:00:52] it
[1:00:54] are you that generation so let's go now
[1:00:58] everything is then
[1:00:59] is based everything we have is based on
[1:01:01] resurrection
[1:01:03] so we have a resurrection look
[1:01:04] resurrection is a state of having passed
[1:01:06] completely through death
[1:01:07] and having risen from the dead
[1:01:11] to be in resurrection is different than
[1:01:12] to be alive
[1:01:14] to be alive is the original state
[1:01:16] without having passed through death
[1:01:17] self-explanatory look to be in
[1:01:20] resurrection
[1:01:21] is to have passed through death and to
[1:01:24] have been raised up
[1:01:26] now jesus christ did that
[1:01:30] because everybody else that has been
[1:01:32] resurrected lazarus and all them people
[1:01:34] that resurrected in brother battle's
[1:01:35] ministry
[1:01:36] they probably have already passed on
[1:01:39] but the lord jesus he passed on and then
[1:01:41] he came back and he never passed no more
[1:01:43] on so it's based on that somebody
[1:01:47] resurrected from the dead
[1:01:50] and he still as the bible says alive
[1:01:53] forevermore amen
[1:01:56] because that way you and i can have
[1:01:59] confidence i can't have confidence in
[1:02:00] lazarus
[1:02:02] lazarus is gone he died that's right i
[1:02:06] can't have confidence in all these other
[1:02:07] now listen
[1:02:08] i'm not gonna say i don't have
[1:02:09] confidence in william branham okay but
[1:02:11] he's done passed on
[1:02:12] my confidence is in jesus christ
[1:02:15] my confidence is because he's the only
[1:02:17] one
[1:02:18] that died rose and he don't have to die
[1:02:20] no more
[1:02:22] but now remember too all those that have
[1:02:24] passed on
[1:02:26] they're in that same situation now
[1:02:30] they'll never die again and they're not
[1:02:32] dead now anyway
[1:02:34] they're more alive now than they ever
[1:02:35] have been
[1:02:38] first corinthians 15 verse 12.
[1:02:42] we'll get to the two prophets this
[1:02:43] afternoon if that's all right
[1:02:45] now christ be praying i've been trying
[1:02:47] two services donnie so help me
[1:02:49] now christ be preached that he rose from
[1:02:50] the dead how say some among you that
[1:02:53] there's no resurrection of the dead
[1:02:58] pharisees and sadducees that's who he's
[1:03:00] dealing with
[1:03:01] but if there be no resurrection of the
[1:03:03] dead then his christ not risen in other
[1:03:06] words he wasn't there
[1:03:08] he was somewhere and if christ be not
[1:03:10] risen then is our preaching vein
[1:03:13] and your faith is also vain
[1:03:16] everybody got that all right
[1:03:19] resurrection revelations 20 verse 4.
[1:03:24] and i saw thrones and they sat on them
[1:03:25] and judgment was given now look see
[1:03:28] look at the revelation you and i have
[1:03:29] now see when we see this what do we see
[1:03:33] we see us setting in judgment
[1:03:37] not at judgment right
[1:03:41] because see it's been a revelation look
[1:03:43] and i saw
[1:03:44] thrones now
[1:03:47] the denominations don't see it that way
[1:03:51] they see a throne and everybody's got to
[1:03:54] stand in
[1:03:55] before them not so it took a profit
[1:03:59] not a larkin not a moody because you
[1:04:01] know what they probably died under that
[1:04:03] same anointing
[1:04:04] that they were going to have to go
[1:04:05] through a tribulation or be resurrected
[1:04:07] and have to give an account at the
[1:04:08] great white throne this is the great
[1:04:10] white throne you will not
[1:04:11] hit this if you're born again today
[1:04:14] you'll be the part of the thrones
[1:04:18] now look there's not gonna be millions
[1:04:20] of thrones who are all gonna be sitting
[1:04:21] like this that's why i'm sitting here
[1:04:24] you're at the throne right here you're
[1:04:27] the throne room you are the
[1:04:29] throne of grace so there's going to be
[1:04:32] people and sure they sat upon what
[1:04:36] in judgment and judgment was given
[1:04:40] unto them not to them read that
[1:04:43] scripture
[1:04:46] in other words here you judge the people
[1:04:52] is that that's what it says judgment was
[1:04:54] given
[1:04:55] unto them not to them see what that
[1:04:58] little word makes a big difference
[1:05:00] because it wasn't judgment thank you
[1:05:04] was given and they're all going to know
[1:05:06] it was given unto them in other words
[1:05:08] you judged because the bible already
[1:05:09] told us the saints will judge the earth
[1:05:13] and judgment was given unto them and i
[1:05:14] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[1:05:16] now watch look at this now
[1:05:17] that we're beheaded for the witness of
[1:05:18] jesus for the word of god and which had
[1:05:20] not worshipped the beast
[1:05:21] neither his image neither had received
[1:05:22] his mark upon the forehead or in their
[1:05:24] hand and they lived in the reign of
[1:05:25] christ a thousand years
[1:05:26] he's talking about the people that are
[1:05:27] standing on a throne
[1:05:36] because we're going to live and reign
[1:05:38] with christ a thousand years
[1:05:41] he's talking about the bride but the
[1:05:44] rest of the dead
[1:05:45] lived not again until the thousand years
[1:05:49] were finished
[1:05:50] this is the first resurrection blessed
[1:05:53] and holy
[1:05:55] is he that has part in the first see i i
[1:05:57] don't know where the where they get the
[1:05:58] doctrine that
[1:05:59] the first resurrection is not gonna do
[1:06:00] you any good i guess
[1:06:04] if you've got to go to the white throne
[1:06:05] judgment because it says right here
[1:06:07] blessed and holy is he that hath part
[1:06:09] in the first resurrection on such the
[1:06:12] second
[1:06:13] death hath no power
[1:06:16] but they shall be priest of god
[1:06:19] and of christ and shall reign with him a
[1:06:21] thousand years
[1:06:23] that's us not in judgment
[1:06:27] with judgment the judgment is with us
[1:06:32] not against us that's right you've
[1:06:35] already been judged if you're born again
[1:06:37] oh please understand that
[1:06:41] first thessalonians 4 we'll stop right
[1:06:42] here
[1:06:44] we'll start right here this afternoon
[1:06:46] but i would not have you ignorant
[1:06:48] brethren
[1:06:48] okay today
[1:06:52] brethren i wouldn't i have you ignorant
[1:06:58] concerning them when you're asleep
[1:07:01] that you sorrow not even as others
[1:07:07] oh i hope i make it oh i hope mama made
[1:07:10] it
[1:07:12] oh i hope something made it
[1:07:16] i like what brother mike said you can
[1:07:17] start out with hope but you can't stay
[1:07:19] at hope
[1:07:21] hope has to go into faith amen
[1:07:24] you can't hope you're saved right
[1:07:28] you got to have faith that god's already
[1:07:29] saved you
[1:07:31] for if we believe
[1:07:35] are we believers today for if we believe
[1:07:38] that jesus died and rose again
[1:07:40] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[1:07:44] will god bring with them for this we say
[1:07:47] unto you by the word of the lord
[1:07:50] paul being a prophet that we which are
[1:07:53] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[1:07:55] lord shall not prevent them
[1:07:58] which are asleep so what are we looking
[1:08:01] for first like i said before we're
[1:08:02] looking for
[1:08:03] the dead in christ to rise first
[1:08:06] not a rapture not even a body change we
[1:08:09] got
[1:08:10] to get the dead saints out of the ground
[1:08:12] first
[1:08:13] this is the order that's why we're
[1:08:15] trying to go through this this whole
[1:08:16] thing that i've been preaching has been
[1:08:17] in order
[1:08:19] it's an order of what's happening in
[1:08:21] eternal redemption it's an
[1:08:23] order and we've not got we've only got
[1:08:25] to to the dead in christchurch first
[1:08:27] the the we haven't got to the two
[1:08:30] witnesses
[1:08:31] hopefully we'll get to them this
[1:08:32] afternoon because you've got two
[1:08:33] witnesses you've got the battle of
[1:08:34] armageddon you've got us coming back in
[1:08:36] the millennium you've got us living a
[1:08:37] thousand
[1:08:38] years you've got the battle of gog and
[1:08:40] magog you've got the future home or
[1:08:42] then you've got the white town judgment
[1:08:43] then you've got a future home all these
[1:08:45] different things we haven't covered we
[1:08:46] ain't even gotten a future home yet
[1:08:48] but it's part of eternal redemption for
[1:08:50] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:08:51] heaven with a shout
[1:08:54] the world's looking for that i'm
[1:08:56] assuming we've already had it
[1:08:58] amen god hiding himself
[1:09:02] in simplicity but revealing himself
[1:09:06] in the same.
[1:09:10] you believe god's revealed the message
[1:09:11] to you then you've heard the shout
[1:09:14] watch the show hey
[1:09:18] what is it i'm presenting you behold
[1:09:22] i send you elijah the prophet with a
[1:09:25] message
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:28] the voice of the archangel
[1:09:32] and with the trump of god and whose
[1:09:33] archangel christ himself we know that
[1:09:35] and with the trump of god
[1:09:38] speaking the dead in christ shall rise
[1:09:43] first then
[1:09:46] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:09:50] caught up there's the rapture together
[1:09:52] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[1:09:54] in the air so shall we ever be with the
[1:09:56] lord now listen
[1:09:57] we're not going to start here and you're
[1:09:58] going to see us going up through the
[1:10:00] clouds
[1:10:03] remember it's sacred the world's not
[1:10:05] going to see us leave
[1:10:08] brother brown said 500 people could
[1:10:10] leave the world and nobody ever knew it
[1:10:14] and if there's only going to be a few of
[1:10:15] us alive and remain
[1:10:17] they ain't going to be millions and the
[1:10:19] world's not even going to know it
[1:10:22] wikipedia won't even know you're gone
[1:10:26] some of you got that some of you did so
[1:10:28] anyway paul did so anyway
[1:10:32] wherefore comfort one that's why you're
[1:10:34] sitting right here wherefore comfort one
[1:10:36] another with these words do we comfort
[1:10:37] ourselves knowing that we've heard the
[1:10:38] shout
[1:10:39] out everything watch this look keep
[1:10:42] going let's go a little bit further
[1:10:43] let's go one more and then we'll close
[1:10:44] right here
[1:10:46] first corinthians 15 51 favorite
[1:10:49] scripture
[1:10:50] behold i show you a mystery
[1:10:55] now in the days of the voice of the
[1:10:56] seventh angel when he begins to sound
[1:10:58] the
[1:10:59] mystery of god should be finished
[1:11:02] listen there's only one mystery left
[1:11:04] folks and that's how god can change your
[1:11:06] vile body
[1:11:08] and not have to get you another one
[1:11:12] that's the mystery because listen the
[1:11:14] whole world don't believe that
[1:11:16] that's right the whole world believes
[1:11:19] you gotta
[1:11:20] die and leave your body where it's at
[1:11:24] because it's vile
[1:11:26] and god's going to give you a brand new
[1:11:28] one that's not
[1:11:30] resurrection that's replacement
[1:11:33] listen that would be easy to do
[1:11:38] but god don't like easy
[1:11:41] because he's hiding it
[1:11:44] because listen i'm telling you 99.9
[1:11:48] of the world believes that there's
[1:11:51] nothing good about this
[1:11:54] it's never going to be good and you're
[1:11:55] going to have to put it away
[1:11:57] in a grave leave it there
[1:12:02] and god's going to just there you got a
[1:12:04] new one
[1:12:06] no no resurrection is not replacement
[1:12:09] resurrection is bringing up what went
[1:12:11] down
[1:12:14] did jesus grab a new body
[1:12:17] and leave that other one in the tomb and
[1:12:19] grab him a new one and then just come
[1:12:20] walking around
[1:12:22] listen they won't be an empty one with
[1:12:25] ray gabriel they won't be an empty one
[1:12:27] i mean there'll be an empty tomb with
[1:12:29] all of you that have lost your loved
[1:12:30] ones
[1:12:32] because god's going to bring that body
[1:12:33] up
[1:12:35] how in the world would he do it and then
[1:12:36] not do it for the rest of us
[1:12:38] he's the first fruits is that what the
[1:12:39] bible says he's first fruits
[1:12:41] empty tomb now is it going to look like
[1:12:44] where you go and you look down and you
[1:12:45] look
[1:12:45] in and like the what was the
[1:12:49] i ain't even gonna say it never mind
[1:12:50] somebody had a video where people were
[1:12:52] coming up out of the graves you know
[1:12:53] uh secret folks secret catching away
[1:12:58] listen if you're gonna have a glorified
[1:12:59] body and god's gonna change your body
[1:13:01] and make it young again and make it
[1:13:02] glorified you're not going to have to
[1:13:03] dig
[1:13:04] dirt to get out
[1:13:09] you see all this though see how that the
[1:13:11] world is so deceived
[1:13:15] because i've had them tell me one day
[1:13:17] the graves were just going to open up
[1:13:21] huh that ain't secret
[1:13:24] jesus is just going to come park the
[1:13:26] park park the clouds and come down
[1:13:28] through the
[1:13:29] eastern sky that's what i told the
[1:13:31] brother i said when you see that
[1:13:32] he was a brother i and he wasn't in the
[1:13:35] message but he's a pentecostal brother
[1:13:36] he said oh i just can't wait so i just
[1:13:38] keep looking at the eastern sky just
[1:13:39] waiting for the
[1:13:40] cloud to part and jesus i said tommy you
[1:13:42] i said brother you're going
[1:13:44] i said you done missed it according to
[1:13:45] the bible because my bible says that
[1:13:47] we'll
[1:13:48] go as a thief in the night nobody will
[1:13:50] ever know it that coming will be
[1:13:52] judgment
[1:13:52] right that coming when he comes down and
[1:13:55] every eye shall behold
[1:13:57] that's judgment folks that's you better
[1:14:00] watch out
[1:14:01] you don't because listen when you see
[1:14:02] that you're gonna be running that way
[1:14:05] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[1:14:07] all sleep
[1:14:09] but we shall be changed in a moment in
[1:14:11] the twinkling of an eye
[1:14:12] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:14:14] sound we've heard that
[1:14:18] and the dead shall be raised
[1:14:19] incorruptible and we shall be
[1:14:21] changed for this corruption was put on
[1:14:25] incorruption
[1:14:25] and this mortality mortal must put on
[1:14:29] immortality all right we're going to
[1:14:32] stop right we're going to read
[1:14:33] revelations 4 1 because that's the
[1:14:34] rapture and then we're going to stop
[1:14:35] right there
[1:14:37] and after this i looked and behold the
[1:14:38] door was open to heaven listen folks
[1:14:40] this is real
[1:14:41] this is the rapture of the church this
[1:14:43] is the word that's not even in the bible
[1:14:46] it's always catching away or caught up
[1:14:49] so let's don't look for a rapture it
[1:14:51] will happen when these other things
[1:14:52] happen
[1:14:54] all right let's go by scripture
[1:14:56] resurrection
[1:14:59] got it change
[1:15:03] you changed in a moment twin club an eye
[1:15:08] then catching up rapture whatever you
[1:15:10] want to call it culmination
[1:15:12] okay you okay you might have to wear
[1:15:15] earplugs
[1:15:16] after this i looked after what after the
[1:15:18] church ages
[1:15:20] revelations one two and three is what
[1:15:21] church ages
[1:15:23] right right so after this
[1:15:26] after this i looked and behold a door
[1:15:28] was opened in heaven
[1:15:32] open book open door
[1:15:35] if a book's closed if the door's closed
[1:15:37] how in the world you're going to get in
[1:15:38] it
[1:15:39] and you know what jesus is so nice he
[1:15:42] could
[1:15:42] he's still knocking on that door
[1:15:48] but not for us we opened the door and
[1:15:51] let him in
[1:15:53] and then that we did that he opened the
[1:15:55] door
[1:15:57] to the bible and then he opened the door
[1:15:59] in heaven
[1:16:01] and after this i looked and behold a
[1:16:02] door was opened in heaven and the first
[1:16:04] voice which i heard
[1:16:05] was that it were a trumpet what a
[1:16:07] message
[1:16:09] talking with me which said come up
[1:16:10] hither and i will show thee things which
[1:16:13] must be
[1:16:14] hereafter because listen when we're when
[1:16:16] we're gone from here we're in a marriage
[1:16:18] supper for three and a half years
[1:16:19] waiting on israel to get there
[1:16:21] to get their atonement so there's a lot
[1:16:24] more to happen
[1:16:25] even after we're resurrected and
[1:16:26] raptured okay
[1:16:28] and immediately i was in the spirit
[1:16:30] behold now see
[1:16:31] one throne
[1:16:36] see we're not in judgment we're going to
[1:16:39] meet our
[1:16:40] savior we're going to meet our husband
[1:16:42] we're going to meet our god and there's
[1:16:44] only one of them
[1:16:46] and if you're if he's sitting on the
[1:16:47] throne of your heart it's going to
[1:16:49] connect with that throne up there
[1:16:52] amen it's going to be the same guy
[1:16:54] sitting on it it's not two guys sitting
[1:16:55] hello it's the same guy sitting on this
[1:16:59] throne in that drone
[1:17:00] only god can do that and behold the
[1:17:03] throne was set in heaven
[1:17:04] and one not three
[1:17:09] one set on the throne let's stand to our
[1:17:11] feet
[1:17:12] musicians come one
[1:17:16] standing in the midst of the golden
[1:17:18] candlesticks
[1:17:19] one god
[1:17:24] and his name is what lord jesus christ
[1:17:28] what a revelation
[1:17:36] listen folks by no means am i belittling
[1:17:39] the world
[1:17:41] but there has to be a separation
[1:17:45] if we live like the world we're of the
[1:17:46] world and we get their condemnation
[1:17:50] i'm just sorry like brother brown said
[1:17:52] you know i hate segregationalism but
[1:17:53] god's a segregationist
[1:17:55] the prophet of god said he was born i
[1:17:57] tell you about somebody standing up and
[1:17:58] saying that in the 60s
[1:18:00] that was pretty rough but he said god's
[1:18:03] a segregation that's why he told israel
[1:18:04] he said don't you go over there and play
[1:18:05] with them people
[1:18:06] don't you go over there with those ice
[1:18:08] and start playing with them well i'm
[1:18:09] telling you don't be playing with the
[1:18:10] heights out in the world
[1:18:12] you're a segregated group of people if
[1:18:14] your bride he has put you in a place
[1:18:17] he has if you put yourself in a place
[1:18:19] you're in trouble
[1:18:20] but if he puts you in the place he said
[1:18:22] now i call you bride
[1:18:24] under the voice under the shout and the
[1:18:26] trumpet i call you bride
[1:18:29] then you have been pulled away from the
[1:18:30] world and segregated
[1:18:32] away from the world into what a new
[1:18:36] world
[1:18:38] i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man
[1:18:42] old things are passed away i've been
[1:18:45] born again

[1:22:05] christ anymore
[1:22:10] you know there's a difference the whole
[1:22:13] world
[1:22:14] as that song says every knee shall bow
[1:22:17] and every tongue shall confess but you
[1:22:21] know what
[1:22:22] we do it willingly
[1:22:25] we do it now because we know he's our
[1:22:27] lord
[1:22:28] amen but some that are going to have to
[1:22:30] get way over there
[1:22:33] and have to be in judgment that's going
[1:22:34] to have to literally get on their knees
[1:22:38] and say that's the lord and never be
[1:22:41] able to make it
[1:22:43] but they're going to confess that they
[1:22:46] missed it
[1:22:48] lord please don't do that people
[1:22:51] if you don't know the lord get to know
[1:22:53] him
[1:22:54] they ain't a thing in this world that's
[1:22:56] worth
[1:22:57] there's nothing worth not knowing the
[1:22:59] lord
[1:23:01] you say oh i'm just this is too hard for
[1:23:04] me and
[1:23:06] no it's not why would god make it hard
[1:23:10] for his children we make it hard
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:15] we make it hard in our humanity god's
[1:23:18] not gonna make it hard
[1:23:22] if you'll get god inside of you it's
[1:23:24] gonna be real easy
[1:23:27] you'll see the world in a whole
[1:23:28] different perspective
[1:23:31] you'll see the word of god in a whole
[1:23:33] different way you'll see
[1:23:35] things that go on around your life i
[1:23:37] hope that that
[1:23:38] this year i i told you at the first of
[1:23:40] the year whatever you got inside you let
[1:23:43] it out i don't care if it's bad
[1:23:44] at least you're letting it out get it
[1:23:47] out of you but if you got god inside of
[1:23:49] you give it to somebody else
[1:23:52] live your life like it's the last day
[1:23:55] you're going to be on earth
[1:23:56] what the prophet told us amen
[1:24:01] but let's give it away amen
[1:24:05] the very thing that we cherish so dear
[1:24:09] you get the new birth you'll want to
[1:24:10] give it away you'll want people to have
[1:24:13] what you have so bad amen

[1:24:19] sure we struggle anyway
[1:24:23] as human beings we struggle we have
[1:24:24] strife and feelings and emotions and
[1:24:27] this and that and the other but there's
[1:24:30] one type post that'll help every one of
[1:24:32] us if you'll get born again
[1:24:34] like i said before it will not take away
[1:24:36] your problems but it will make your
[1:24:38] problems easier to handle
[1:24:40] now is that not true christian friends
[1:24:43] it won't take away
[1:24:44] your problems you think it's a flower
[1:24:45] bed of easy being a christian you're in
[1:24:47] bad shape

[1:24:51] all
[1:24:51] life situations jesus lord amen all of
[1:24:54] them i don't care you name one and
[1:24:56] god will help you do it but you've got
[1:24:58] to make the move to open that door to
[1:25:00] let him in

[1:25:03] of your house
