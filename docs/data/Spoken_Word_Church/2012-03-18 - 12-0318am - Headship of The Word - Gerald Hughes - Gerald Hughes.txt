the way you know exactly but you know philip didn't know that he knew right that's right so sometimes we can know and and just not uh realize that we know right exactly uh this is not a message quote but i think they say it's a something like a chinese proverb this comes to my heart so i'll share it with you before i let you be seated i think it goes something like this he who knows not and knows not that he knows not he's a fool shun him right yeah shun him right now he who knows not and knows that he knows not he's simple right yeah teach him yeah right he who knows and knows not that he knows is asleep wake him wake him he who knows and knows that he knows his wives follow him yeah that's right amen and the wise shall know their god amen amen let's bow our heads for word of prayer just before we read the word heavenly father we're thankful this morning that we can come with joy in our hearts and thanksgiving lord to have the joy of our salvation the assurance of eternal life in our souls and lord to see this fine congregation here this morning smiling faces and lord ready to honor you and serve you and lord if there be some here that needs deliverance yes lord body solar spirit lord a little uh maybe this is a little bondage or maybe just a little loss of the joy of their salvation perhaps lord god you're not satisfied until everyone is happy and rejoicing we remember your servant and prophet's word how that you said that you want us to get learned to get happiness out of life right and lord life is a joy at thy right hand lord amen and the full in the presence of the lord is fullness of the of joy at thy right hand are laid up pleasures so lord may we find our fulfillment in thee this morning grant it dear god and lord may we seek your fulfillment your good

our pastor here lord brother dale brother wade lord and they're each one lord brother colley who's reading the scripture this morning and lord the musicians the the deacons lord and the trustees and

you bless them father may we all together serve you with joy grant these things we ask now in jesus christ's name amen a real short reading of scripture just before that you're seated and uh i want to read from saint john chapter 19 and verse 25 saint john 19 25 and then we'll also read from ephesians chapter 5. real brief reading this setting is at the cross and in one place brother graham said there's only two of the disciples really that made it to the cross uh he's stressing here about john and mary and i want you to notice each one of these are a type of the bride in this our day but here they are at the cross verse 25 now they're stood by the cross jesus mother and his mother's sister mary the wife of cleopas and mary magdalene when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple now that was john standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her into his own home amen i want you to notice the lord jesus placing mary is um under john's hitship right exactly and um after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst ephesians 5 21 now uh 5 and verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body amen i want to speak this morning by the grace of the lord on the subject of the headship of the word amen the headship of the word and you if you'll shake your neighbor's hand behind you or in front of you or beside you say god bless you then i'll let you be seated be sure and give them a big smile and then you can be seated thank you for the deal amen i feel good you pray for me i'll pray for you amen that is the way god's bride will do and amen right right i feel good and you know we don't go but feelings but feelings sure do help them hey amen that's right uh you know what physically i don't feel that great be honest with you i had a fall i shared a day a little bit earlier i didn't want to bring attention to it yesterday or anything don't want to today but uh just to give a little brief testimony wednesday of this past week last wednesday and i was due to minister some of the saints down in buford there and i was helping brother keith for the job uh it's a column of brick about six foot high i had to tiptoe to see the top of it and uh but a fellow backed into it messed it up it was the corner column of a kind of a pickpocket plantation there is a show house and uh where they have the tours and so forth and so he was under the gun and he asked me to come down and help a little bit and then to minister for him on wednesday night well i had the the brick replaced you know i chiseled out the bad ones and straightened up the pier and got it all sealed back and so forth and and up on top of this six foot high or so porch was a a rail a wood rail wood wooden rail and uh this last brick that i put in place i had to get up on top of the porch and bend over this rail to dress that put a little grout in it a little uh cement you know a little mortar just finishing it off you know and so forth but as i was leaning over that rail you know on top of the porch that whole ten foot section of rail gave away and man i go about i didn't die and i fell i fell there was no doubt you know it died it was kind of a control something there was no control but i'm glad the lord had control and i it could have broke my neck but i i got one little bitty um a quarter inch scratch and it didn't even draw the blood but just on my finger a little bit and oh lord i was reaching feeling for blood yes my glasses had broke a bit down and so forth and thrown off the side of my head and i thought my talk about jordan of life that it and uh i didn't break any bones you know and i'm so thankful for that i shook myself a little bit i crawled over i was there by myself uh under the shade of the truck it was hot that day and the sun shining and so i i just kind of recuperated a little bit and i just thanked the lord you know that nothing and but then i thought well i sure don't need me checking anything out further i went back to work and uh i was just almost finished i thought but then i had to work another two hours to replace that rail railing you know and so anyway uh then it was friday night then we have at our little home church uh which by the way for some of you who don't know me uh uh i pastor i pastored the same church this next year will be 40 years is a little church that brother branham was instrumental in helping us establish he come to colombia twice and then in in that brother arnett asked him in 1965 if we should start the work and so the work was started in 66 and brother brown said yes get a building feel led to the lord follow the leading of the lord you know so we got the building in 66 for iverson how many of you ever remember brother uh i think came out of the presbyterian church and uh he had was our first pastor and brother palmer had asked me to come down into this part of the country in those days brother dale i was supposedly you know kind of rumored to be at least the youngest preacher in the message now i'm almost the oldest not quite and he just turned 70. he just turned 70 right 71. six anyway next year will be 40 years i've been pastoring the same church it brother palmer had asked me to come down and speak for him over here in macon and then he took me on over to colombia my first time to be in columbia south carolina in 72 and then they after brother did resign they asked me to come back and pastor i said well i'll come and minister for you for a few months i ministered for him six months and then i said i'll give you opportunity to vote and that way it don't it's not a dictatorship you know it's a sovereignty of the local assembly well so i uh and believe it or not last two years i gave them an opportunity to vote again and they're still putting up with me and but by the grace of the lord now we have an associate pastor and i'm able to get out a little bit more and he's bearing the burden this morning at home and so uh gives me a little opportunity to do more missionary work and so forth too man so i want to say this to you before i forget it i appreciate the generous offering that you all gave me yesterday the lord richly bless you not only the church but the different ones that was here nice offering and i appreciate that but backing up now i'm going to use some of that cash probably to pay the the uh a chiropractor how many knows brother brown said the lord used his car crap i'm going a long way around my elbow to get back to my thumb my mind you know runs in circles but we have there in our home church we have one two three four four services a week two on sunday wednesday night uh ministering preaching and so forth as well three services preaching and then on every friday night we have a great big eight by ten screen that we pull down and we have the table and it's continued kicks and we have not only the words of the message but we hear the voice of the prophet amen and we come to hear that a tape every friday night and so this past friday night we was finishing up the third part of the invisible union and as i was sitting back toward the back and um when it comes to that was telephone hookup you know on that particular message and uh brother branham said now uh and it seemed like he was talking referring to the telephone hookup somebody out there he's making the altar call and so forth and there's a a pastor standing up with his hand up and that just somehow struck home with me i can't explain it but i stood up and i lifted my right hand and when i did i uh i i heard on you know what i i don't want to be a halfway christian you know there's a pastor with his hand up right right i said well if i identify i want to be wicked so when i put my hand up just as high as i could brother dale in my in like the inner sound of your ear right cloak right clunk and i knew then that i'd knocked that shoulder out of kilter i pulled it out of socket when i fell you know and so uh you all pray for me amen all right it's still not right but i've got i just haven't had time to make it my wife had told me now show you how the lord works through your wife sometimes she said you need to go to chiropractor and i said no i i'll be all right well then that night you know with the lord spoke to me and showed me what it was something out of socket here right right when you get them clunks and planks you know it's not quite right like a cuddly not quite right but i'm thankful that i had the rotary and everything it could have been just shattered and i've got a little sore spot on my head and a little sore spot on my left hip but uh i was able to get up this morning finally get get to moving and got a hot shower you know that's right and uh but i'm faithful amen that's right and i appreciate your prayers and so um the lord is just so good to us now i want to speak this morning um i want to speak about the headship of the word and you forgive me maybe i started to say something didn't complete my thought but uh let's go right into the word of the lord now i'm not we're not here to talk about ourselves or our bruises i'm sure each one of you have bruises physically and probably some spiritual faces uh i enjoy induced a little bit earlier with brother dale and brother wade and then brother marlo and uh different ones and uh i tell you what it's hard for me to pull away from that good sweet fellowship you know but we have to concentrate on the word amen and uh you know faces of christ amen amen you know right brother brahman said that jeremiah was christ to the people of jesus christ amen didn't say it was jesus but christ means anointed one right amen moses was christ to the people of his day and today we must see that is christ in bright form right amen christ in you right no hope of glory amen that's right so then uh we want to remember brother black that the lord is uh calling us as individuals to represent him and here's a beautiful thing nobody period can take this is god's love to you nobody can take your place in the accompaniment that's right man sir i said nobody absolutely nobody can take your place in the economy of god god's got a place for you and the body of christ amen that's his love to you everybody nobody hey if you try to be somebody else who's going to be you all right amen right brother see somebody's got to be you that's right oh god and see now you all forgive me and i know you wouldn't know who i'm thinking about here when i say this but perhaps you've seen it yourself some preacher that'll get the maybe the pastor or some popular minister spirit of them come on and they act just like them sound just like them turn just like them or whatever you know right and all this happened said we need to get the holy ghost right not you know man's killers we get one another spirit sometimes instead of the holy spirit but we don't want that right we want the spirit of christ is that right amen and so may the lord help us we want to talk this morning about the headship of the word right amen amen right now remember luther see um back up just a little bit here we look at um daniel's vision or the king's vision and daniel you know interpreted it um he's seen this hint of gold right and then the rest of uh silver and then come on down to brass uh and then on down to the feet right of iron and clay satan kind of in reverse yeah but god builds his from the feet up all right amen and so we see the headship of the body now coming to uh the body right the church and uh luther wesley pentecost coming on up see from the feet right on that brother in one place said right and the last thing he said now we're in see it was the toms speaking and so forth and he said now we're in the seeing age see the seer amen all right but he said the last thing then to come into the church is what right the intelligence there's nothing moves above the eyes you can maybe wiggle your ears a little bit but your eyes in most cases a little bit higher than the ears if you're looking up all right you're looking down your ears might be higher all right but the last thing that moves in the body is the eyes that seem right right but in behind those seven horns and behind those seven eyes there's an intelligence and that handshape is coming right i'm quoting now from the message um christ the mystery of god revealed that's right in that glorious message oh to me that's one of the most powerful messages there is yes sir but in there he said the headship and the body has h.a.s become one unit all right man amen what's he saying say christ coming down time and eternity blended right right yesterday we stopped about we talked about god stopping time and i read four or five quotes to you where brother brown said god's reached his mighty hand out and stopped time right another place he said he's holding tight right right otherwise he said we're past time right and god is just waiting holding or until the church can get in their position right right amen black he stopped the sun so in that first ephesus joshua paralleling ephesians in the new testament they could get in there and take their inheritance get placed position adoption see now so today he's waiting for the adoption right to quit the redemption amen everything has to come out and you must know your place right your position in christ and let the headship of the word come into your heart the handship of the living word i believe in saint john 6 63 jesus said the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are light amen you cannot separate god from his word when he's in his word his word is anointed amen and the words that i speak they are spirit and their life we read the quote yesterday where he also said we're not feeding up on a man right exactly hallelujah that's right luther was the carcass for his day wesley was the carcass for his day the message they had right and so forth but at pentecost for their day but now see the full word the full body word of god is here right for rapturing faith and it brings the very intelligence of god in to the bride right amen amen all of us in god he poured into christ all that's in christ he pours into the bride not into one individual right but into the body and if we're feeding on the body word right that's it we're not feeding on a man but we're feeding on the body word of the son of man amen amen what was that what is that the carcass amen the body the latin word carcass you know like corpus christi right you know it's the body of christ all right then if it's the body word it's the word in the body and the government shall be were up on his shoulder all right family where is his body amen man hey where's the headset on the shoulders right right amen and his body is his earthly strength amen but now all that was in god he pours into christ so you must know that it's christ in bright form you must see the faces of christ you must discern the body of christ that's right amen amen all right we can't take communion properly until we deserve that right right you can't see because you're not communing you're not feeding right spiritual communion is when you recognize christ that's right there's earning the carcass discerning the word in body form right right amen see feeding on the body word right there's the true five-fold minister sorry man where's god took his man but not his spirit all right he took the major prophet but he didn't take the faithful ministry all right right amen right and he he took amen his servant because and he prophesied ahead of time he was going listen to the message shalom there he said when the music reached low in this great symphony and he said it freaks out the end of the life of william branham in this earth he said i'll go down with the music right yep yeah he said but it'll be high again right amen that's right i'll come up with the music right here amen yes sir and then how can i overcome at least the message there brother said they're more privileged than we are all right the ones who pass on brother dale right and go by the way the grave are privileged above the ones who are alive remain right we thought it was the other way around right but no they're privileged above the watcher library made for one thing they rest from all their labors and they're the first ones to come forward right there could be no rapture till there's a respect yesterday what difference does it make what time the rapture is going to take place right if you're not ready for it right amen so the main thing is be ready for the rest right second kings the the sons of the prophets plural not sons of the prophet singular right but the sons plural of the prophets plural right see all right they knew the very day that elijah was going to be raptured yep right sure and they tried to show it to elisha myself said i don't want to hear it i know that but you know i you know i want your revelation of it right right yeah they knew the very day that elisha was going to be raptured take it up no it's telling up my head's going to be taken from me this day they were in touch know something about the times right but they wasn't part of it right right they stood it far off and watched both elijah and elisha cross jordan yeah and they watched elisha come back right and they wanted to look for elijah even is it right we're looking for him in the mountains and so forth the revelation of the rapture was not perfect it was not complete even though they knew the day right man the more important thing is to be ready for it right you'll know the day when the day comes right true bro whole mind right lord help us right if we're under the headship of the word right man see now let me just um i'd like to try to blend this with yesterday's message if we could because it's a it's a blending of time and eternity yeah amen now god has reached out in stop time for what purpose why was the question yesterday why did he stop time right yesterday i believe we learned that it was for the readiness of the church waiting for us to as it was when he stopped the sun and the moon right in the days of joshua that first ephesus now where ephesus means beginning see we're going back to the beginning now right we've run the full cycle of the seven we're back to the uh eternity now right at eight amen when you receive the holy ghost you pass from time to time all right you stepped into that hey man you know absolutely there's no beginning you know right now what's time time is a loop perfect circle right now this is all time is this is a simple thing listen real close and i've got a quote right here but i'm just going to take and paraphrase it and you can get it from the message perfection 56 but brethren said time all time is is a perfect uh eternity's a perfect circle and time is a little loop right like a little hickey like a little loop in that side see you've got a perfect circle going like this all of a sudden there's a little loop down the bottom satan calls that yeah yeah so it calls it but jesus come down from time into eternity to make that blood streak back across that little hickey that little loop all right see oh praise the lord and he's here now amen to stop time right and blend time with eternity right right oh praise the lord thank you lord and god and his people now are blended together amen as time and eternity is blended right christ and his people right right our blend yes sir amen that's the that and the whole thing then is restored right amen the whole thing is being restored this is the age of restoration right right see it's a restoration and um um i'm gonna be referring to this message now um christ the mystery stay with me in there he said um christ the tree of life you know was made flesh right right let me back up just a little bit god's whole purpose before the foundation of the world was to share his eternal act with you amen yes sir that's god's whole purpose yeah right that's right uh you know what let me say it like this i have to be careful um how many ever sat down and enjoyed it nice steak or a nice meal i mean by yourself and you probably didn't have to watch your manner so much because you're just really enjoying it you know by yourself nobody's watching no cameras on you okay that's good you enjoyed it but whenever you can share that with your wife right all right or a friend that's right now that's real fellowship all right it tastes better doesn't it man that's right right what would life be if you was the only one who had like yeah right right what would like be if you was the only one who existed in the universe if you was just elohim let's say right come on right god's whole purpose of existence is huge family see what i'm saying spiritual save gene of god the whole picture is so simple it's god materializing himself glory man he couldn't think in terms of being any greater any higher he was already the highest he couldn't think in terms of ascending he was already the highest but he could only think in terms of condescending right all right coming down coming down becoming material see and that's when the word was made flesh right in christ amen he was the beginning of the creation what are we the continuation of the same creation right right god made you pay for your sins at calvary right right god had not yet separated from adam the bride from the groom at calvary brother put it like this god made you pay for your sins account right living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins and didn't have any of his own right right bro carried my sins forward now if god if he was cursed stay with me three times in the book of genesis the tree of life is mentioned three times in the book of revelation in all six places it's speaking of the person of jesus christ amen but that tree of life had to come down and be made flesh before god could share that eternal life and before man could truly protect the tree of life it was ordained of god that that tree of life be made flesh right now amen only through that channel could we be a partaker that's right my blood is drinking deep in my flesh right here's me indeed right right amen stay with me we've got five kingdoms as it were i know there's many offshoots from that different branches my five main kingdoms earthly um mineral kingdom the botany kingdom plant life trees grass etc flowers mineral kingdom the botany kingdom the animal kingdom right and then the kingdom of man yeah and then the kingdom of god right right let's just look at from that that standpoint for just a few moments here all right now look it always takes something from the higher kingdom to reach down into the lower kingdom to transform part of that lower kingdom into the higher kingdom right plant the acorn see a seed had to be planted in mother earth right mother earth didn't produce anything without seed right exactly but when the seed was planted we've got a great big old tree i can't reach maybe about halfway around that thing right beside our house somebody said er won't you cut that down so close to your house it's not real close it's about 15 feet away i said that's the reason i built the house here because of that nice oak tree right it's a good healthy tree right it produces shade it's an air conditioner itself you know and so forth and an atmosphere about it's it's a living entity right but see that stared at one little acorn hallelujah and that anchor taking a transformation living on the minerals transformed that mineral kingdom into the botany kingdom how did it become that big when it was all that big it was a transformation of pulling out of the lower kingdom into the higher kingdom amen look at the grass it feeds on the mineral kingdom and then the higher kingdom the animal kingdom comes down and eats the grass all right our kingdom reaching down to the lord kingdom pulling the grass or the deer loves the acorns you know and they'll take that into themselves and we come along then the higher kingdom and kills the deer right put it on the table or the beam right amen what is it the mineral kingdom the botany kingdom has to die something has to die every day for the higher kingdom to live right now as we eat the beef or the venison their uh mineral kingdom minerals and vitamins and everything and the botany kingdom seed is uh from the animal kingdom comes into the kingdom of man and we live by dead man right but now we come to a little dilemma try sitting down see in a number three wash tub and grab the bales and pick yourself up yeah or see if you can pick yourself up by your own bootstraps so it takes always a higher source to come down amen hallelujah everybody and god came down amen christ see god amen oh my all is in god right and him dwell dwelleth not just dead or will but now present tense to wealth glory all the fullness right and he is now in the black right right he's here he's here elijah's god is here he's with us today that's right now so we see that when he came down some 2 000 years ago and that word was made flesh to do away and bring a blood streak across that hickey of time yeah see time is actually like a perversion of eternity exactly it's exactly all it is just a little perversion of eternity but god comes to blend everything back in perfection right see now when christ came down then what was it it was the tree of life being made flesh but he had to be cursed right now that's a that's a cruel thought in a way the tree of life right the most precious person the most precious source the only source of eternal life had to be cursed right what was it when that tree of life was made flash they chopped him down hung him on a cruel roman tree right yeah curse this every man hate on the tree the bible says right now think about the tree of life for a moment being cursed because of god's love for you all right bro god thank you lord who is the tree of life amen become accursed what for to redeem us who were under the gospel under the curse right amen of the fall right right amen and under the curse of the law that's right and so forth all right but see now watch them with that oh my this is you will get this in the message crash the mystery brother that makes this statement and all i listen to it now i'm just going to paraphrase it instead of taking time to read it i've got it here but i'm just going to paraphrase you go listen to the message yourself right i think that's a good challenge right in this message brother branham says now then when he was uh this tree of life was cut down cursed hot on a uh roman cruel tree yeah see public shame strip naked then we see that through that he brings forth the bridegroom all right all right yes sir right god had to put the first ever sleep to bring the about right god had to put the second adam asleep right as we born the image of the earthly that was the first animal right this is in the image of the first animal that's why it's the diamond right yeah that's why death wars and sin even warriors remember right it wasn't your body got born again right it was your soul right man is that right right the body didn't change it was the soul that changed hallelujah that nature of the spirit had to be changed right hallelujah that old man has to die but we see how that when that tree of life was cursed amen he brings forth through that a bride tree which will be the tree of life restore right that's the prophet's words that's god's words to you i am the prophet right right now watch this real close the tree of life cursed see through that bringing forth the bride tree which will be the tree of life right restored right sure amen amen did you all ever stop to think about the tree of life needing restoration right yeah i didn't until i come to the light of this message exactly the tree of life in need of restoration right right do you know brother brahm said that we are leafs on the tree of life right did you know jesus said i'm the mind and you're the branches right amen did you know the whole purpose of the bride is to reproduce the group did you know we are fruit of the tree of life did you realize that we are the fruit of malachi 4. right yes and did you realize that malachi 4 was exactly what david the prophet was prophesied about in the first psalm right the greatest thing you think to write about in the first thing that he could think to write about and the most precious thing was the tree of life oh yes and then his son solomon must have picked it up also because over at 11 30 he said the righteous the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life right right amen amen oh i'm going to say something all right listen the fruit of the righteous now and when god give us the divine interpretation of psalms chapter 1 you know he shall bring forth his fruit in his season right that's right he said if you'll notice there's two jesus there yeah he said his fruit god's fruit in the season of the prophet exactly right he shall not see his leave shall not win right amen right amen he shall bring forth his fruit in his season oh my amen what is it it's a restoration time right right now all right right here we find ourselves right yeah see god no longer stop thinking about this just a moment i know you might think somebody i'm going in circles but just stop and think about this one place the prophet put it like this he said elijah now remember he took a rapture right yes enoch he took her after yeah enoch elijah even the great apostle paul never dreamed of the opportunities that we have today all right that's right brother glory amen all right enoch elijah even the great apostle paul never dreamed of the opportunities that we have today amen god's even stopped time for us yep right right waiting for us to recognize our opportunities and who we are amen who he is right what our responsibilities are right oh my god help us amen the handshape of the word is here exactly we have the answer to the devil's questions that's what the world is and the world counts the churches and everything's being formed for us right right to try to shut us up that's what the devil's howling about right that's why everything is happening the way it's happening because god has slipped down into satan's eating just like satan slipped down into god's eating right amen in the garden yep i am impregnated eve before the first adam can get to her yeah so likewise jesus christ has slipped down into satan's even after six thousand years impregnated a bride and under no circumstance at all can she be deceived right amen under no circumstance at all because the spiritual womb is sealed right man no other sin can take place right brother amen the head ship of the bro of christ coming to the church in an invincible union right i'm talking about the living word now which is the hemoglobin of god the pure all things are pure stay right right see i'm talking about the resurrecting christ becoming one with his church right amen amen him taking the preeminence all right amen somebody told napoleon one time said he was a little tired you know and they bring him into a table where he's going to feed him and and uh it's a long table because it's room for all his generals and you know his staff and so forth and uh they had a head chair set up there he got about middle of table sit down oh no uh bonaparte mr napoleon sir the head of the table is up here he said anywhere i said it's the hidden table right amen exactly anywhere on the side right yeah it's the head of the table all right and if christ is in you yeah wherever you sing that's right do you hear what i said see he's got the preeminence in you all right exactly you don't have to sit behind the table right you're not trying to lift yourself up all right he's he's got you in a position where he has the preeminence he's the preeminent one thank you lord see it's christ in you that's right not christ in somebody else his identification is always with you right oh brother sister glory when the devil tries to shut us up that's when god's going to take us out glory to god you ought to rejoice and look up because right and we see the squeeze coming now there might be uh some uh listeners sitting right in here from satan's eating right you know taking inventory they've got access to the internet or you know take recording whatever they yeah they know what we're talking about but they don't understand it okay man it's not for them all right all right they could understand they'd be part of they'd be fellowshipping yesterday they had fellowship in the mystery they'd be in here all with themselves they left this tree of life right let me feed on this tree of life right glory they're looking for it yeah they're trying to reverse old age yeah yeah that's right brother you know they're trying to spot the uh the atom and all this and then smash it and you know find that matter that you know right beginning of creation and what caused creation if they could ever tap into that but the devil cannot create nobody can only pervert right right but he sees now that in the ranks of the bride there is this creation because squirrels have been created right and he knows the power of the word to degree right he just don't understand this mystery right that's it amen brother man said he just don't understand it right that's it correct he don't know this secret exactly now there is a secret folks uh and this i think it's the same message i was referring to christ's mystery brother brown said he just don't understand it and uh he said now but it looks like a contradiction but where the contradiction appears to be that's where the revelation lies right amen where he says there's no secret that they can hide from thee right all right that was the covering chairman he was god's right-hand man to fellowship with he trafficked in true revelation right yeah sure he trafficked in true revelation but he was exalted above measure by the abundance of that revelation right see god allowed it but he wouldn't allow it with paul right and he wasn't right right but see now satan the bible says there's no secret that they can hide from me right commanding satan sure another place commending satan it says thou art wiser than daniel right that's right and daniel was found to be about seven nurses so times wiser than all of nebuchadnezzar's biases right exactly right but they aren't wiser than daniel right yeah but see there is no secret they can keep from being right but god can keep it from exactly amen that's right we don't have to keep the secret from the devil the lord has fixed it to her he just can't see it he'll make three gods out of them every time he is or two right yeah he can't see this mystery of christ revealed exactly he can't understand this tree of life right exactly oh brother now what was i i think we're supposed to be talking about the hit ship of the world yeah amen but i i know it's a long ways around but we're coming back to it see now here the higher kingdom always feeding on the lord kingdom but when it comes time now for christ the tree of life to come he doesn't kill and feed on the lord kingdom right he dies for the lord kingdom right amen right is that right the creator become part of his creation amen and then said except you eat my flesh and break my blood amen my meat is my flesh is meat indeed right my blood is drinking right now it's spiritual right he paid the supreme sacrifice and the blood cell of jehovah was broken amen see lord form of life couldn't do it under the law they could offer a lamb but that lamb the life of that lamb could not come back upon the adulterer right even though he was forgiven to change his nature but now the higher form of life the holy ghost blood cell jehovah was broken right right wasn't the blood of a jew blessed in the blood of a gentile acts 20 28 says take heed to be the flock of god we're with the holy ghost that made the yours here right which god capital g.o.d had purchased with his own blood right amen amen the blood of god right and when the blood cell of jehovah was broken it loosed the life of that blood come back right and how does he do it through it by the word amen spirit and word right sure the handshape of the word comes in glory to god yes see you can't separate god from his word now sorry remember that now all right so we see the headship of the word coming we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved everything that can be shaken shall be shaken hebrews 12 right but we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved amen and the prophet of god put it like this he said our kingdom is the headship of the word right our kingdom is the headship of the word right then you better get that word in you now we're all looking for our bridegroom to come right we're going to meet him in the areas the climax of what's already begun right the rapture is in process but we're looking for the climax how will she the bride recognize her husband the reveal word unless she's constantly in that world right exactly amen like that's where he says we must continually and constantly be feeding on that word don't tell me you're in love with this isaac unless you're listening to his love letters right you're listening to him whisper his secrets into your ear that's right amen you say you're going to be caught away to a marriage supper oh but are you reading the love letter amen brother gemini dalton then they asked brother brown said you know we're happy to be your hunting buddies and give us a little inside line here to get closer to god give us the secret how do you do it brother branham he said all right here it is are you ready pray and read your bible every day glory pray pray and read your bible every day right all right oh that's too simple brother brown yeah yeah that's it feed on the word amen die down to the living word right glory do you realize that it took elisha ten years and the message second hand wrote brother brown said it took elasha ten years to die down to fit the robe the mantle what about you dying down right diving down feeding on nothing but the word right glory oh glory to god so happy to hear sister brenda testified yesterday brother dale yeah at the table and she was talking about that a little bit naturally and so forth but then the lord spoke to her and said that's the same way you do it in the spirit right hey man i tried absolutely just feed on the right thing come on but you know what we're too busy sexting or texting yeah you know we're doing this this is the text we need right here amen and uh right here if we get this text yeah yeah amen but everything satan's eating see they made everything so convenient for him to look at some television or something no wonder it's driving them insane right yes that's right brother amen i've already sell the member to turn the thing on even in the motel room or where we're visiting we went in yesterday evening and there was one in every room yeah the lord had provided us a nice room the church here didn't have to pay for it but this little north of here i better be a careful called hollywood don't you call me a hollywood television there you go but there was a television in every room yeah it's two bedrooms a nice kitchenette and it's condominium like it a good friend of ours provided it in so uh first thing i've done one of them had you know the fold the doors that fold over it kind of like entertainment doors you know and we folded those doors i went and got towels and covered up the other two but you're not even tempted to turn on for the news because if you're not careful when you turn i'm not trying to be legalistic now just i'm just saying be careful i'm not saying it's sad to watch the news or anything like that but i was up somewhere here sometime back and i turned it on and and something else looked a little interesting you know i thought well that's just kind of clean you know and i'll just you know and first thing you know man i spent an hour or so yeah yeah and then when i finally got the or maybe longer and i finally got it cut off anyway my mind is going in a circle now and i know all those things are just acting and putting on but it's in my mind and all those things that whatever you know even whenever you're going down the street you better turn your head and look at the cross right there because once you see something your mind takes a mental picture of it right and then you've got to have your mind sanctified right to melt all that stuff away it takes the blood of the lord and that thing no wonder brother said these televisions are preparing your little children and so forth for a blast from hell and he said it's driving them insane insanity that was 50 60 years ago we need to be careful we need to diet down right david said i'll set no wicked thing before my eyes all right that right what are you reading see this is a true love story magazine or something where's the bible right see our did you realize that pornography has become more popular in the last few years and it outsells the bibles yeah bibles used to be the number one salary right but now pornography yeah and not only in the book form but now they've got it on the internet and everywhere just make it so real they'll just pop right up to you all right turn your head sons of god right amen daughters of god turn your head feed on the word set your heart and affections on things above right fall in love with isaac your jesus hallelujah our joseph jesus is that right fall in love with him let him whisper his secrets to you right he's fixing to come be on guard brother brown said watch and pray right right let's stand guard and watch for the coming of the lord it could be just any day now time and eternity's planning together all right the headship of the word has already come right right already exactly the bride here's the secret is this brother em said the word is in the bride as it was in murray she has thus saith the lord right she has the mind of christ she has the word of god and she has the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the world amen amen old devil you better look out tonight because that's the word of the lord amen i shared with brother dale earlier this morning how brother brennaman a message said now all god means prayer how many believes the prophet's prayer is anointing yeah sorry man oh god he said help us lord god to use your faith which you told us is ours yep exactly god help us to use your faith which you told us is ours right then he goes on that same prayer and he prays on down there a little bit and he quotes romans 8 as many as he four knew right he also did predestination and so forth he didn't justify he didn't predict me and then they'll he whom he justified he also glorified amen and he said god the father you foresee not foreseen or are or he said you foresee right exactly right now yeah oh my i i can i read right here those who he justified he was already glorified and the father in his own faith right amen kept god's faith failed listen to me now you might doubt i'm going to give you all permission right here this would be a little strange to you perhaps do you know it's okay to doubt yeah sure i'm gonna give you all permission to doubt just a little bit this morning brother branham was quoting brother bosworth brother bosworth said it's okay to doubt if you doubt your that's doubts only thing you're permitted to do exactly he's your own mouth okay all right he must have the pre-events right right the bible says casting down imaginations and every thing that would exalt itself against the knowledge of christ right exactly and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ the world all right see the greatest battle being fought it's being fought right now in your mind it's been fought right now in your heart the greatest battle is not armageddon your greatest battle is going on right now and it's between faith and doubt right it's between love and fear right hallelujah hallelujah but faith brings you to rest love god leads with love but that will drive with fear right exactly is that right all right man amen oh my brother my sister think about this just a moment the handshake of the word glory coming into you right right to help you to believe every word when you believe every word don't question your god right right god sends a guide vindicates that guide and you get out in the wilderness somewhere and say i think we ought to go over this mountain get back to camp yeah yeah well i think we want to stay a little longer the god says hey this the snow coming this storm let's get out of here right right we got to get out of here or it's going to be dead right you better listen to your guys exactly you better not question your gut right you and i are not subjects to make the decision right we have to follow the guy right glory to god i feel good that's right when god sends a servant a law of receiving a servant must kick in and the only way that you and i can serve god on earth is to receive that servant right exactly and we can only serve god and please god as that servant interprets the word of god to us right now amen to god we've received a vindicated interpretation in this hour right that which is perfect is god amen that's right the perfect interpretation of the word of god with divine indication right as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of saint paul that's what he's restored what is it it's the mind of christ amen what is it it's the kinship of the word right it's something you can hang your eternal destiny upon right right like i talked about that chain you know it's only strong since weakest link but we're trusting in a chain that every wink is strong every link is vindicated right you can hang on it you can stake your eternal destiny on this word it didn't come from man right it didn't come from the assemblies of god it didn't come from the world against the churches it come from the mind of christ amen it's part of the plan of his redemption he stepped right down into time right the stop time and the blend time with eternity and to blend us back with christ hallelujah the tree of life coming down hallelujah but in this message restoration brad tree brother brown says bride and groom one tree of life right right quick right stop thinking about that i know that's strong meat but bride's time for brad recognize who she is right yep at nate calvary brother brown said the greater works he said can't you see that he said the greater works is to impart spiritual eternal life right that's the greater works think about this what's the brightness what's the bride to do reproduce the groom right now man how can you do it apart from receiving his seed that's right sure amen but when you rest now a lot of us here maybe we might need to go and adopt something if we can't produce nothing right brother brown said just get that adopted faith to start with that all right sure uh you can't now i'm speaking spiritually to the church not just to the ladies you know that can't have any children but brother ma'am said it's been proven then that if a mother can't conceive maybe she just got over anxiety and so forth she's going to do it so bad she you know and that's where we want to be we won't serve christ right we want to produce right what what god's called us to reproduce right all i just want to produce the life of christ holland's going to produce a christian without slaughter blemish but you can't do it oh exactly all right i said you can't do it all right but you can receive something right man that will do it right right you say oh it's hard brother hughes to live this message it's impossible right without christ right right it's not only hard yeah it's impossible right right but when you receive him right he's the overcomer and it don't matter what you got to overcome as long as you know how to overcome as long as you got the overcomer inside you right and you know he's already done it right you just follow him then yeah right hallelujah follow that example let me set it for you right oh hallelujah i feel good just to think about this just to think about what god's doing in this hour and to be a part of it and then to thank you good folks here would invite us over to share these things with you yeah that makes me feel even better right oh my i'm one with you right you might see something i don't see her i might see something you don't see or whatever you know some of us relate bloomers but the main thing is that we're we're blooming and we're going through this right is it right and we're all connected to the tree of life right whoa ah we should love one another right right don't hear something evil against your brother don't imagine evil in your heart against your neighbor all right man they will try to come in here and upset you and boy i've got to get to my messaging my original text here that i take it of course it's the hitchhike of the word i want you to see this one thing right quick before we close okay yeah all right it's 10 minutes until 12. it's okay if we go 12. yeah all right now i certainly feel a real good spirit here a real freedom man so you know it's that when it's that way it's a pull right now we become common with one another when we rub shoulders with one another but let's look here just a moment at mary and john at the cross now let's look at mary yesterday we talked about mary having that responsibility to receive conceive give birth to nurse and bring that word to maturity right right and then i told you that each one of you have that same responsibility right you have the same responsibility that joseph had to bring that word provide for the word do you know that's what you're doing right here when you're obeying the simple message of coming and being faithful right not failing to attend church not forsaking the assembly of yourselves together you're faithful in your tithes your offerings your prayers did you know that's part of the intricate part of the program of god right these simple things going with the same simple message you said all right this was part of god's program or brother brown wouldn't have said everybody needs a church home right someplace where you go you call it your church yes sir is that right absolutely right and where you pay your tithes and your offerings you call it your church you support it with your prayers your attendance and so forth and your offerings well look here jesus believed in church order right he's the origin of church organization that's right he believed in the fivefold ministry he wouldn't have a ministry but he imparted his own ministry to the 12th yep after the 70 yeah and he ended up with 11 when it was all over but then he got paul to replace students is that right and all right we see now that 24 hours have to be there in their place right now but look here at john and mary at the cross jesus the headship of the word amen the lord of the harvest fixing to go away all right now mary had been responsible to bring that word to maturity but then she come also under the headship of that word right because here she is following the word all the way to the cross all right amen she and john made it to calvary right you can't have a mount transfiguration experience until you have a gethsemane and a mount calvary experience you've got to come to the cross first there's got to be a death before there can be a resurrection and a rapture right right and so here is mary and john at calvary hallelujah born again there's really been a change in me right out of glory born again just like jesus said born again all because of calvary oh i'm so glad so glad i've been born here they are calvary and we see jesus giving instructions to mary to get under the headship of john right right jesus didn't leave murray without hitship right right let me say this too brother in one place he said it's possible he's talking about the five full ministry it's possible for a man to have more than one of those gifts sure that's what he said all right now here we see the apostle john who's one of the 24 elders right that's right john's the apostle handpicked by jesus vindicated to be one of the 24 elders 12 apostles 12 patriarchs right all right now yet we see that this same john become a pastor of the greatest church of the new testament right and he was also a scribe yeah is that right right right john pastored the church at ephesus the greatest new testament church there is one didn't need much correction all right man amen all right now look and we see then that when jesus here it is now listen close jesus put mary under the headship of john john led mary to the upper room amen exactly everybody mixing the clothes considering the end of their conversation the bible says listen closely right man said nothing all morning long get this listen close john led murray to the upper room where she received that same word that she had conceived some 33 years before he received it in his heart into her heart right right he is now with you he said but he shall be in you the word that she had once conceived in her world nourished and seen brought to maturity and crucified and ascended right condescended now right into her heart and then john took her with him to ephesus right a gentile church yeah took her out of jerusalem yeah took her out of nazareth joseph perhaps already died remember he was old whenever they got married when she was six to 17 years old he was already in his 40s brother said right so at the cross he was probably already he'd been whipped and he's 70 50 was still alive yeah but now he was one of the overcomers so uh nonetheless we see that under the handship of john mary ended up over in ephesus yeah and you know what she's doing she's doing the same thing she'd always done she was helped bring that word to maturity amen but she had transitioned from the john the baptist age and the law age now over into the age of grace and the baptism the holy ghost and now she's under the headship right under john right and they're working together to compile all of the epistles of paul and they're working together to take the uh gospels matthew mark and luke and compile them together in a canon of the scriptures and that's why that john was put on the isle of patmos for the word of god saying exactly the devil didn't want that word put in order but holy ghost amen you're still here putting the word in order hallelujah amen what is it it's the mind of christ and you right when you read the bible when you pray when you hear those tapes yeah the holy ghost is there right they put it in order for you yeah yeah oh is that okay figured out but god's already got it figured out you don't have to figure it out you believe it right glory to god what is it it's the headship of the word yes exactly there is a true church of the living goddess but she might be few hallelujah jesus said she would be here a little in there a little every kinder nation tongue tribe language and people right yep closing with this thought hear about about a month ago my son-in-law ben david i'd ask him if he'd go and help us because we had some youth meetings to minister down in uh arakipa way south of lima and uh one of the original inca from descendants from those incas had come and accepted the message and it invited me to come down and want me to come and so uh brother ben david was he prayed he felt led to the lord but see he had to meet me in lima i had to go through bogota in colombia and he was to make me a lima but so he's flying myself i picked up my interpreter down in um or our interpreter uh down in florida brother tony cepeda he goes for the keister chill some of you know him very outstanding you know real introvert and so anyway uh he's flying in the plane brother ben david is and he gets his testimony uh down in peru you know and so he said lord i i i i i know you know you're i feel as you're leading but i just like a little more confirmation and here he is and he looks in the the front of the seat okay and there's a uh in the back you know of the airplane seat in the front there where the fray table somebody talked about tracer right in behind there a little place where they carry the magazines and stuff and i think it was a safety instructions and in that it was rev it said that's what stood out to him he got his attention rev 10 and um eight or eleven let me just see right quick what that is i don't wanna um but he said now i knew that was probably you know uh speaking about being revised rep you know it's a revised from maybe um 2010 or something like that you know it's what that meant because it was the safety instructions of the airplane but he said bless strange seem like the lord might be in that so he got the he said i didn't even know there was a ten hey there are 10 11. i knew it was ten one through seven yeah yeah now he's a young minister you understand right so you don't have to have it all figured out that's right and uh here though he um he uh he goes to 10 then and it was 11 i think the yeah the 11th verse it was 10 11. listen to this and he said now he's wondering about whether or not he should go do this missionary work okay he still wants a confirmation he felt led to the lord he moved by faith right but he's wanting a little more confirmation sure this is his thoughts all right and so here the lord gives him this scripture then right in front of him you know you can't see nothing about that yeah all right and it's revelations 10 11. listen to this and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen amen amen and then he he got to study in the whole chapter then and a lot of that yeah and he realized hey right john wrote the book right and that was said to john john is the type of the bride and the american embryo the type of the rapture that's right yes sir what is it what do you say brother hughes revelation 10 1 was christ 10 7 was the prophet's ministry yeah but we have a ministry amen that's right the bride is a prophetic i'm not talking just to the five-fold ministry that's right but the bride herself is a prophetic class of people and the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy that's right the bible declares that the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy right when you're testifying about this message you're prophesying amen when you're given testimonies of what god has done in this day and what he is doing it's prophecy coming through you and through the bride and the prophet he'll confound the world right they can't receive it but it still has to be preached in every nation for a witness whether they receive it or not right it's got to go into our nation for a witness that's right didn't say all the nations would accept it right right up here in rutherford north carolina here some time back we had a great meeting and one of the brothers from india come up and uh his brother um i won't call the names but he said i speak the word for all of india to be saved it's okay to speak the word but you got to speak according to the word god didn't promise all india to be saved right right you understand what i'm saying right right so be careful as long as you're speaking one with the word you have a will right this is the word revealed will of god yeah all right i'm closing see and uh we must speak accordingly all right you can't go do your own thing but and only as he inspires you right according to what he's already confirmed right it's the word revealed will of god glory you understand not your mind or your imagination oh i'm going to do this i'm going to do that oh be careful now that's right brother man it's got to be under the direct leadership of the holy spirit the only way we'll know that is through prayer right right amen what's going on heavenly father we're so thankful this morning such a reverent hungry little group of people that are how you come among us lord we believe it lord you've shown your headship of your word and what you're here for the intelligence christ no wonder the devil don't know what to do with us no wonder as your servant and prophet said their fellow province up in alaska where they'll take these people with these peculiar beliefs these little odd beliefs give them a little promise try to separate them oh god we know that though we're in satan's eden we're in the world but not of the world and there's no way lord that they have any strings attached they can only do what you permit them to do they we have the same mindset that you had you can do nothing except it be giving you of my father you can have no power over me whatsoever except be given of my father because i've come into an invisible union with the headship of christ he's my husband i'm in love with him lord made each one of us here this morning re-examine ourselves and uh as we fellowship this morning in the mystery of what you're doing lord and the headship of the word having common and invisible union to the bride a marriage already taking place here we only go to the supper there then lord help us each one individually to be sure that we're letting you be lord of all yes lord not just our savior but lord we want you to be a please lord not just to be lord but we want to be able to hear you say well done yes thou good and thou faithful servants enter thou into the joys of the lord lord i thank you for the faith and the simple simple faith and the uh just for the opportunity lord the confidence the vote of confidence that is shown lord and we feel such a liberty here this morning to preach your word and father not to hold back as paul said lord i thought that shawn declared me the whole counsel of god lord it's wonderful to be able to fellowship in the mystery of what you're doing in this hour lord we pray that we're in our understanding it's dark and that you'll clear away all
