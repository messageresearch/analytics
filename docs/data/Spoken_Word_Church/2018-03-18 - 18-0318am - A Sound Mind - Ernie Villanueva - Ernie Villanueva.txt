let's just sang open the eyes my heart his brother Ernie Villanueva comes to bring us the message today and you pray for him the Lord bless and give him strength giving the words we have to hear amen you know because faith comes by hearing is right you can't buy it there's nothing you can't work yourself into it and just sit down and listen and let God speak to your heart amen amen so open the eyes of my open the eyes of my heart I won't [Music] in the [Music] amen a blessed year this morning we've seen that song holy holy I think that's the ultimate destination that each one of us wants to live we want to live in that holy of holies don't want to live in the outer court or the inner court want to live in that holy of Holy's brother Branham says have you ever met somebody who's been there it doesn't matter if it's Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday or doesn't matter always sweet always kind always gentle and when you're when you're in that presence nothing else nothing else matters it's a it's a supreme supernatural experience that is that is reserved only for the bride of Jesus Christ you know oftentimes people they think that that we're a human being and we've come to earth to have a spiritual experience but in reality and if you really go back to the essence of what brother Branham brought about we are a supernatural being and we've come to earth to have a human experience and our mandate in our mission and our passion is to overcome that human experience which means our eyes or ears or taste or touch or smell and then our conscience or memory or imagination our reasonings and affections and let the Holy Ghost take control of the control tower and just steer you and we have to you know God has put us on free moral agency and the greatest power he gives a human being is the power of choice and so we have to be careful everything we do every hour of the day we make choices indecision thousands of them we ride down the road we make a decision go this way go that way stop four and so our mind is constantly in motion and so we've got to be careful the choices that we make what we allow to go in to our eyes and ears because once we allow it whether it's a book we read or a mag zyne or whatever once it goes into the eyes or ears it takes a journey instantaneous journeys of the back road of your mind and there is produced a thought and those thoughts become words and words produces actions actions form habits and habits produces character and character determines our destiny and God puts that choice in front of us what a powerful choice and I'm just so thankful that that God has chosen us to receive this this this message and take us on a supernatural mystical journey and we can go with transdimensional travelers friends we live in a natural world but anytime we want we can just close our eyes and make a decision to go into that supernatural world and just meditate on the Word of God and let God saturate our being with who he is and who we are amen I want I want you a special request I am I have a desire to go to the Philippines and I want to go next month and they have a ministers meeting the first the first of every month and brother Vernon has asked me to be there for that ministers meeting the first week in May and I haven't been for several years and I cannot tell you how you know how much in excitement and anticipation and expectations of God I've been there 27 times but every time I go there it's like the first time and the Filipino people they have a they have a nature and a culture and and they just they have a sincerity and a humility and a respect that that you very very seldom find in the world and so please pray that that God will make that way for for me to go and so I know each one of us we have prayers we have needs on our hearts and I pray today that something will be said in the word that will help you to meet that need that you have and we're going to asked you to turn in your Bibles to the second chapter a second book of Timothy chapter one and verse seven and this morning I would like to speak on a subject called a sound mind second Timothy one will start reading at verse one before you read let's pray father this is your sacred supernatural book and we know that that revelation is a sovereign act of God we know Lord that only you can impart revelation so many people they have lots of knowledge but they don't have wisdom to operate the knowledge because they have not received the revelation and lord only you can cut through all of our mental faculties all of our emotional needs and and go right down and just reach us right at the core of our being Father and Lord we want that core of each one of our beings to be stimulated today we pray Lord that that that your word will be spoken and your word will be heard and your word will be acted upon by your children father it's a serious a sobering time an hour that we are living in father we love to enjoy our faith we love to enjoy our company in the believers Lord but there comes a time when we come to your word and Lord I pray that the sacred time the short time that we'll spend this morning it will be encouraging and edifying to your bride and we ask these blessings and your precious and Holy Name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so Paul is speaking to Timothy says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my dearly beloved son now this was not Paul's son as you all know but anybody who Paul personally witnessed to that received Christ Paul considered them his son so said Timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of the in my prayer night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelleth first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in the also this is the the the scripture the key scripture I want to focus on and Paul is saying wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou steer up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting out of my hands for God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God who hath called us and who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began amen god bless you boy that is that that is a mouthful that Paul just spoke and if you can see if we can take Paul's you know Paul's thoughts he's speaking to Timothy and in the day that they're living in it was a very dangerous time to be a Christian because Nero was on the throne and Nero he was a madman you've all heard that you know the the idiom that Nero fiddled while Rome burned and he blamed it on the Christian well Paul he knew that Timothy was just a young he was just a young minister and he was trying to encourage him he said you know don't don't let fear and we know that fear is a four-letter word it's f.e.a.r false evidence appearing real or false education appearing real now to the world they want to f.e.a.r forget everything and run they just want to turn tail but but a Christian is a warrior a Christian they know the weapon of their warfare and you know it's time it's time that people they stop becoming a victim you know there's victimology now everybody think well you know I do I got a problem and I don't have this and I don't have that we need to concentrate on the things that we do have and not the things that we don't have people love today they love to have pity parties and pour me parties and what was me and nobody's got it so rough as me and nobody understands me you know the human being we have five basic needs all of us number one we all want to be loved number two we all want to be needed we want to feel like there is a purpose for for our life we all want to be understood because there's nothing worse than being misunderstood and and we we all have a big sign on our back it says please make me feel important and you know we don't advertise that but in reality we all want to feel like we have a part to play we want to be loved we want to be needed we want to be understood and and so we want to be we want to feel important and there's nobody that can fulfill all those needs like God can God loves you God makes you feel important God lets you know that you're needed and there's nobody that can understand you like God does you know many people will misunderstand you and in the Bible the men who brought the Bible the prophets of the Old Testament they were all misunderstood and most of them were killed by the very people that God sent them to to minister and so in in that word if you go into the amplified bible that scripture in 2nd timothy 7 the amplified says now god has not given you a spirit of fear but of power and of love he has given you a mind that has been delivered rescued revived salvaged protected and brought into a place of safety and security so that it is no longer affected by the illogical unfounded and observed thoughts that Satan wants to put in your mind a sound mind yeah you know brother branham he talks about people who did not have a sum he talked about Elvis Presley he said Elvis Presley had to have four or five psychiatrists that traveled with him just to keep him on stage now just recently one that died not too long ago Michael Jackson here is a man his mind you think about the demons that were rolling around in his mind he could not go to sleep they had they had to give him anesthesia every night that doctor had to come in and take that propofol and they had to put him under for him to go to sleep for him just to get some rest but God has given you an eye a sound mind he's given us the weapons of our warfare you know if you read the message the greatest battle ever fought if you want to keep a sound mind and you want to be balanced and know who you are you need to know how to fight and brother branham this is not all in one paragraph but he says about the devil how to fight the devil he said cut him chop him wacom slice him maim him kill him kick him out now this is not playtime this is real these demons if you're a son of God belong to this message you've got a bull's-eye on your back when you wake up in the morning every demon in that area that's a sign to you they know your name your address your email address your cell phone number they know every mistake you've ever made they know your weaknesses and sometime they will come and they will gang up on you yeah a whole bunch of demons will come and try to you know to get you into an area or try to set a trap for you to walk into see we need to know brother Branham says we need to know our own weaknesses and we need to keep them covered you can you can sense when those demons are coming you can sense them their presence mille to just to take positive action some of the greatest things we can do is speak the name of jesus prayer praise righteousness all these these are weapons brother Branham says when the weakest Christian gets on his knees the devil begins to tremble now we've got to be aware of that we also need to be aware that when we were born there was an angel assigned to us and that angel has been with us every step every day the angel has been with us through the good the bad and the ugly he's seen it he's watched it but he's there to protect us we're never to people say well I'm lonely how can you be lonely if you have a revelation and the understanding that you have an angel and I believe those angels they like to be recognized they like to well I'm thankful like you how many times I can think of where where I should have been dead in a car accident and and and it just seemed like you met just by just by a little fraction you know you miss a horrible accident and that was that angels just take that thing and just push a car out of the way for you to survive I've had accidents where a guy hit me my car flipped twice and rolled three times and you know all the when I was going through that all as I was saying was Jesus helped me and when the car stopped I jumped out of the car had to kick the door open jumped out of the car and I ran because I didn't know if the car was gonna blow up and after I ran and and you know they found out I had had ribs that were all cracked I was as sore as possibly could be but I know that that angel of God was there with me that the the policeman that came they looked at that car and I cannot believe that you're walking I cannot believe you're standing I said well it's not me it's the God that I served that has prison that has preserved every one of us we have a mandate and that mandate is to be a shrine for the Holy Ghost no you're not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost and you know every part of our body I was talking to brother Wade the other day and every winter time I get little cracks right here on my thumbs and I was talking to brother Wade says do you have any of that any any of that honey products or bee products that you can put on there and I went to the pharmacist and I asked the pharmacist I said don't you have some kind of thing that can repair those creamy buddy else get cracked right there and your thumbs you know what he told me he said get some superglue and put some superglue on it he's that'll hold it together and it won't crack and then after a summer time you can just kind of get a file and just file it off but you know when one little part of our body when it gets out of what maybe it's a how many have ever hurt your toe oh and when you hurt your toe that's all you can think about is my toe or your wrist or or knee whatever it is see in this body it works super naturally in harmony that the mystery and the wonder of the chemicals of our body the digestive system the respiratory system the nervous system I mean it's just a wonder to behold we are fearfully and wonderfully made and we are made to prosper and thrive in the realms of the supernatural we're the only ones that can do that you know here in Georgia there's out tens of thousands of churches that will gather today and there's men who have studied and maybe they're going to give a good sermon about the Bible and people come to church and they expect to hear a man of God and and it'll hear sermons but I can tell you out of all the thousands of churches that are going on right now there is not going to be one single true new birth take place in any of those churches outside of a message Church it's impossible it's impossible because I'm talking about a new birth with the baptism of the Holy Ghost because brother Branham said there's only one true evidence that a person truly has the genuine Holy Ghost and that is that if you can receive the message for your hour and manifest the life that's the key many people can quote this message many people they love to argue the message then they got a a warrior spirit on them but they they argue about the wrong things you know I love when I when I read things in the Bible and and and it's just personal to the bride purse and in things that other people can never see I love her brother branham you know what when they were talking about the seals there was a great debate is the seals open is this the seven sea is it open is it not open well I read where brother Branham said that now remember some people the only exercise they ever get is jumping to conclusions right now I don't want you to do that I will hear me out the brother branham said the Seventh Seal is not open to the public but it is open to the private special bride of Jesus Christ brother Branham one time you know people talk about you know being saved by the blood saved by the blood saved by the blood brother branham said you're not saved by the blood the people's uh-huh what I'm not saved by the blood brother said no you're kept saved by the blood but you were saying before the foundation of the world you're in the mind of God and God knows every step that you're going to take you know people you know people can talk about you know foreknowledge and they believe that but when you talk about predestination I mean it stumbles oh yeah I said well do you believe that God knows how many hairs are on my head right now they said yeah I said do you believe he'll know how many hairs would be on my head next week yeah he'll know but they cannot believe that God knew before the foundation of the world who he would call who would serve Him what their life was going to be so we are predestinated to prosper in this realm of the supernatural revelation is the definition of revelation is a supernatural multiplication of inspiration and revelation for communication with God we are linked up with am nipa tense linked up with emissions linked up with this omnipresent but we have to be aware of it many people are slumbering that they're walking or and sometimes you go to churches and people there like spiritual mannequins and sometimes you see people you know and they move a little bit and I said well there's been a quivering of the corpse but no real movement yet and and weird to me the Bible says we are lively stones maybe we forgot there were lively stones maybe we forgot how to say amen maybe we forgot that you have a responsibility to enter into the service you have a responsibility to help brother Sam help brother wait any minister to stand behind here we are depending upon you now what if I get up here and say well today we're going to talk about the Seventh Seal you know it reminds me of a story this Baptist minister he was up there and he was preaching and he looked down and he saw brother Lee was sleeping so he said to brother Smith he says brother Smith he said you go over there and wake up brother Lee and brother Smith says no you put him to sleep you go wake him up and so we need to be aware when we come to church we don't come to church to be a bump on a log we come to church to be on the edge of our seat to be waiting for God to reveal something about our nature something about our future something that we don't know to be able to read between the lines I said yesterday brother branham's are we sufficiently impressed with what God has done amongst us you know I want to tell you a story I don't know how it happened but I wound up at PTL Bible School Jim Baker's Bible school 1981 they had a commercial on television you know when they had television had just become satellite network and they had the TV in and they had Pat Robertson's 700 club and Jim Baker and I was like it was like bedside baptist 24 hours a day you know you could turn that television on and so you know I had a desire and and I felt the call in my life and I was going around the Full Gospel businessman giving my testimony and and I saw the the effect that it was having people were coming and getting saved so I had a desire but in those days you thought well I don't have I don't have time to go to four years a Bible School a theology school and back then if you didn't have a degree you didn't have a certificate you couldn't preach anywhere I'm not talk about message Church I'm talking about denominational churches you had to have a Baptist degree or a Presbyterian degree or some kind of a degree where you went to Bible School and you were trained before you could get behind their Pope something by you know an even Assembly of God they had Assembly of God school I was thinking about going to that school and they come on television they said we have a boot camp we have a 11-month boot camp for ministers and you don't have to go to four years of college you'll be busy from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed at night time you'll be in the jails you'll be in the rest homes you'll be out ministering and something grabbed me and I got an application sent that in got accepted and went there I had the most wonderful awful year of my life it was it was it was akin to organized insanity is what it was like and I was a little bit older than most of the students that were there so they they elected me to be the president of the student body and every week I had to go and meet with Jim and Tammy on Friday afternoon after the broadcast and it was it was just like a tradition you know we went and they they they sat there and they asked question but you know there was no real depth to it and you know you I gotta say you think Tammy Faye if any you ever saw her on television you think she looks scary on television you should have saw her in person and and and everyday they had they had one of these shock jocks on the on the FM radio and they had everyday they had a little section about PTL and about Tammy and Jim and his and you know it like three or four minutes and one of them was that they got these t-shirts and the t-shirt looked like a painter just taking just splash paint just like you should and so on the back of the t-shirt that said I ran into Tammy Faye in the malls today but there I was in the middle of that and anybody who was going to be on the television show at 11 o'clock they had him at the chapel service at 8 o'clock getting warmed up we heard every kind of a doctorate every kind of a theory and and one would come one day next thing he would come and contradict what the guy said before and so I mean it was it was it was something and so finally I graduate from PT a-- but I want to tell you Jim Baker he was a marketing magician so he went to Israel one time and he saw the place the factory where they made the little widows mites and so he was intrigued by it now I talking about and he said he said can you mass-produce these just oh yeah yeah we is it any amount no matter how many our yeah yeah we can so he got the idea to bring those widows mites and he had a beautiful little case to put him in and he had the scripture I mean it was a beautiful display I think it cost him seventeen cents for the two widows mites and and the little package again and and I remember that he said now folks he says we have an incredible offer for you he said right from Israel you're going to have the opportunity to have two of the original widows might just like the Widow's mite and and you know and and they had the higher fifth the more storage places just to put the mail in for the for the mailman to put it in and they had to hire a hundred more people to count the money when it was coming in now brother branham he says that that whatever a voice goes it never disappears you know it's out there somewhere now could you imagine if one of these TV evangelists one of these guys if they could ever get the voice of let's say Moses Moses voice out there when he came down from the mountain with the Ten Commandments I can just imagine they said well you know folks we have an incredible never before offer we have the very voice of Moses as he was coming down the mountain with the Ten Commandments and for an offer this is a very limited offering and for only $1,000 you can have eight eight that they had tapes back you can have a tape of the voice of Moses and I'll tell you friends they would that millions would come in but we have 1100 plus tapes of the voice of God every message brother Branham preached it was a masterpiece he didn't preach any sermon that was not a masterpiece because it was Jesus Christ it was inspired by God could you imagine you know what I got really locked down to this message when God gave me an absolute it was when brother Branham I hear it is now sister you don't know me and I don't know you but there is one here who does know you and doesn't know me it says now when he and his spirit comes in me and my spirit goes away and he gives me a temporary resurrection in my spirit and he wants to use my body and I'm so happy loan it to him now when a person gets that understanding they can they can divide the a son of man from the Son of Man the Son of Man wanted to come in and use a son of man could you imagine what that was like her brother branham's there and all of a sudden he his spirit gets ejected and Jesus moves in and Jesus tells who what when where why and all of a sudden you know he's finished and brother branham gets lamb back into his body you know he said it's all like a dream to me now but whatever he said you do it when I when I got that when I understood what God had done in my generation and brother branham was the elijah prophet of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 I mean to say I was enthusiastic it'll award enthusiasm it comes from the Greek word in Theo's en th e OS and it means God within or like God so enthusiasm and in 2nd Timothy it says you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and that word power comes from the word Greek word Dunamis and that's where they get the word dynamite from and so the you can take him paraphrase that you shall receive dynamite after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you should be exploding upon the scene every day everywhere you move a son of God is an action a daughter of God is in action with a mandate with a precision decision to serve God to find that perfect will of God you know we were not looking for the message nobody was looking for the message we didn't even know that was a message before coming to the message friends I was like a spiritual skeleton I hadn't no I had no meat on my bones talking about Revelation I had doctor and I had customed I had rich oral traditions theory I had these things but when I came to the message God began packing on pounds packing on pounds until finally you become aware of your destiny you become aware of your origin you become aware that you're an eternal being you never had a beginning you never had an end like God said to job Joe where were you before the foundation of the world when the sons of God shouted for joy and Joe after he had been making all of his talk to God and then he says I hope I've said enough and he closed his mouth said Lord I said enough and so here we are as children of the Most High God you know what happened went went when Moses when Moses was raised up what what a destiny had he was he was born at a time when all the children should be killed his mother and father they had confidence that he was the deliverer the random said they were praying for God to send a deliverer and Moses mother and father they prayed that Moses would be the deliverer they were praying specifically and so when when the danger was their brother arrested they put a little ark and they put Moses in that Ark and just put him down the Nile River and he floated down the Nile River all the crocodiles and alligators in there but he had he had a purpose and a predestinated destination and miriam share and she she's walking along gonna see what what's happened to her little brother Moses and God just directs that Ark right into Pharaoh's daughter's camp and she looks at the baby she said oh it's one of the Hebrew children it's one of the ones that my daddy says must die but I'm gonna keep him right I'm gonna raise him up oh my god knows how to do it and raises him up powerful man intelligent man brilliant genius military strategy living a life of luxury living a life that we cannot even begin to imagine all the while my mom said remember you're the deliverer who meant remember your place remember you call it he's a don't worry mom I'm studying and you know I'm studying about warfare I'm studying about how to be a soldier and when the time is right I'm gonna lose I know I'm a deliverer and we wound up with one dead Egyptian one dead stinking Egyptian and then the next day he's still in that moment he sees two two two his rails who Jews arguing he's a Brothers what are you doing arguing and they said Oh Moses what are you gonna do you gonna kill us like you killed that Egyptian yesterday and that was it a fugitive 40 years on the run taking care of dirty stinking could you imagine the tortured mind of Moses having to go from the lifestyle he had out to the backside of a desert and then getting a wife that nag nag nag nag nag nag nag oh my and then after that you know Moses now he's 80 years old the thought of God ever using him was the furthest thing from his mind and God comes and God just happens to come in the burning bush and Moses he got excuse itis he gave God every reason in the world why he couldn't do it he couldn't go he couldn't be the man and God said okay yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get your brother I'm gonna get Aaron and Aaron he'll be your mouthpiece and and you'd be God to Aaron Aaron will be your prophet now he hadn't seen Aaron for 40 years and Aaron just happens to come walking around the block just comes walking around the mountaintop Oh Moses where have you been all these 40 years and mo what we got a job to do and you know we don't have to go into detail but Moses went in there and he rocked that that that that that that Egyptian Kingdom like it had never been rocked before and finally they come out and finally you know the last-ditch favor you know what happened Pharaoh's wife after you know Pharaoh changed his mind every time a plague come Affairs okay you can go and then the Bible says God hardness no you can't go you can go no you can't go and finally when they left Moses wife said why you little wimp you Patsy you choose gonna lose gonna make bricks for us who's gonna take care who's gonna wait on us so favor one more time one ditch he gets the army and he goes out there and they all wind up dead now they're on the other side the children are on the other side and they're dancing and at the tambourines going everything's good but now there is a major issue to be handled this is a desert you've got two million people that's that's adult plus the children plus all the animals that they brought with them and they all had to eat every day and they all had to drink every day and it was God's opportunity to show his children that he was Jehovah Jireh now so God he begins he begins to pour out his blessings first of all and and I've done some some work on this every day it took four thousand five hundred tons of manna to feed those people every day and I'm sure the first day it was there all it tastes good I'm healthy you know no sickness shoes don't wear out clothes don't wear out oh my was wonderful but after a while it become common to them every morning a manner run go to go out there you know to pick up the man and just pick it up and bring it after a while no thought of where this manna came from they shouldn't be manna I mean manages appears and they lost a supernatural aspect of what God was doing and after a while they begin to complain about the man you know if you take it you take it all the way out to 40 years it was 65 million tons of manna that God provided for those children in Israel now a ton is 2,000 pounds so take 65 times 2000 65 million times 2000 that's a lot of manna friends but they got tired of the man and so God started sending him quail now you've got three million people and so that means that each month that had to be 90 million quail had to appear out of the sky and just drop down and so they made a quail run after a while essence didn't bother them that they shouldn't be quail out here in the desert didn't didn't think about where it had come from all they were thinking about was their problems you know brother branham said they were never more than a day's journey from the promised land but for 40 years they marched around and they were grumbling and complaining and they were gossiping and feeling sorry for themselves and complaining about Moses complaining about manna complaining about the quail in the meantime God is doing one of the most sovereign supernatural acts on a daily basis but they're numb dull desensitized frozen immobilized paralyzed to the supernatural and many today are paralyzed to what God has done and the man 1,100 sermons plus are laying their manna for us to feed upon to get strong to enter into that supernatural essence that we are designed for you know you are what you eat and many people are not eating the word I was talking to brother Sam and brother Sam was talking about and we had something in common how many people he thought had never read the seals book from cover to cover from cover to cover and and one time I was in a church and I just asked how many people have never read a church age book from cover to cover all the young young children are looking around see see who's gonna raise their hand so finally a whole bunch of the and some seniors adults raised their hands too I said well how am I never in a seals book from cover to cover hands went up so the pastor and the Deacons they had some church age books and seals books shipped in and they started passing them out and I encouraged them I said you know if I was a parent and I had a child and the child could you know could read and understand I would bribe them if I had I would bribe them I'd pay them whatever it took to read a man sent from God read a church it and make sure they give you a good book report you want to know what they learned in this chap you know and pay them whatever it takes what what is it worth if your child receives an understanding and gets baptized with the Holy Ghost what's it worth if a man one time had Spurgeon he said he said when your children to Christ when they're young and they'll be your friends for the rest of your life you won't have warfare in your home you won't have to worry about them getting involved with the wrong crowd you know I know I know a little bit about the wrong crowd when I was young that was me I was the wrong crowd there's nothing positive going on you know and the guys that I was running around with it was you know eat drink and be merry that's that's all that's all it took but if you win your children to Christ when they're young my what with all the problems that you avoid the atmosphere in your home the love that's in your home it makes it so easy for God to flow it makes it so easy when you go to the message and you have an understanding of what God's purpose is for a mother and a father and a family and how to operate the Bible the the the the the Lord's Prayer thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven wouldn't that be great if that was our home that the will of God was being done in our home every day as it's being done in heaven I want to go a little bit further now how many have ever seen the rock the rock that Moses had you see this little rock it's about this big and it's got a little trickle a little trickle of water coming out of it anybody ever seen that well I Got News for you that rock it had to supply 100 million gallons of water every week for the children and the animals and the adults now I tried to multiply that by 40 years and my computer wouldn't go that far so in that rock I mean it was a gusher a gusher and they didn't have to have a dolly to pull that rock around that rock just followed them wherever they went the rock just went with them could you imagine I mean I mean how could you not understand God if you got a rock following you and this rock is producing a hundred million gallons of water every week to keep everybody a lot keep everybody hydrated God knew how much hydration that they needed and and so now we talked about just a minute victimology you know we know that Satan is our enemy but the Bible talks about Jesus triumphing over the enemy triumphing and and you think about in the old in when the Philistines and in in the the Hittites and the jebusites and all those and when the army would go out there and the army of God would have to go out and fight those people and they were going to war and there were women that were losing their husband for a while and children lose their daddy for a while and they would go out to war and they would come back maybe some of them were wounded some of them were bruised but when they came back whoa a procession you've got the king the noble righteous King he's riding on that Steve coming back and all of his soldiers that went with them they're sharing in the glory coming back riding and then in back of that you've got hundreds of carts load of the booty all the gold all the silver anything that was worth anything they put it on carts and that was a part of the procession and at the end of the procession the crowning glory of the procession was the unrighteous Philistine or the unrighteous he died and he's there and he's got chains on his legs chains on his arms and he's just kind of walking like that and the people are looking at they say you mean this is the guy this is the one that caused all all those problems and you see that that's where we are Satan is a defeated foe the paradox is the battle goes on every day but the war has already been won and we have got to act you see in in in Satan's Eden there are Victor's and victims you have to decide which one you're going to be you need to be the hero of your own story God has ordained you God has equipped you to become a hero he's equipped you know we were in Murfreesboro one time and one of the brothers came up had a t-shirt brother Wade and it said it said I survived Laodicea and my pastor brother Bisco he said well he said that's good he said but next time you pretty shirt put I overcame Laodicea and that's what we are we are more than conquerors friends we are overcomers [Applause] we're getting rid of the clothes just just in a minute now but I want to take you in in Acts yesterday we talked about about a fool for Christ and if we can go into Acts this is going to be a last scripture for today and we'll pick up pick up tonight but if you can go to Acts chapter 25 and Paul now has been rescued Paul now Minh freedom and now he's he's before Festus and and he's preaching to Festus and and after he preaches to him Festus is shaking you know he's shaking like this and he says to Paul I will hear you at a more convenient time and he walked away my you know he was shaking like that at the gospel that had been preached to him he was vibrating with fear he knew it was true but he knew he couldn't live it and then they take him and he goes from there and he goes you got Festus Felix and Agrippa one of them says I'll hear you at a more convenient time the second one said Paul much learning has made thee mad he said I'm not mad I just got the mind of Christ and the third one Agrippa Agrippa sitting there and Agrippa says Paul almost persuade us now me to become a Christian let's let's stand to our feet friends could you imagine these men they had the Apostle Paul the the first church age messenger personally preached to them but the three different responses one of them says I'll hear you at a more convenient time second one says you don't mad you're crazy you're a nut I've had a lot of people tell me I'm a nut I said I might be a nut but I'm screwed to the right boat I am screwed - thus saith the Lord I am screwed to eternity I was telling some of the brothers I've decided what my next vehicle is going to be it's going to be a travel like a thought vehicle that's gonna be my next new vehicle that I get oh my water day that's going to be friends and we're going to look we're going to look Jesus in the eye we're going to see him he's going to say to his bride well done good and faithful servant enter into the kingdom prepared for you but to others he's going to say depart from me you workers of iniquity iniquity is doing something that you know you're not supposed to do or not doing something you're supposed to do depart from me and they're gonna what Lord didn't we do this and didn't we do that didn't we he says I never knew you I never became intimate with you we never had relations you never became pregnant with my spirit the Holy Ghost did not dwell in you it didn't lead you it didn't guide you it didn't direct you to the place where you needed to be depart from me you workers of iniquity you know brother Branham went when he preached about the great white throne judgment if you've never heard this friends I want you to hear it today he said that great white throne judgment when a person walks up now the bride's going to be there and the whole world's going to be there everybody's going to be looking and that person that walks up there brother Branham said their whole life is gonna flash before them like a great big screen and they're gonna see their whole life and brother Branham said now we're not going to be able to judge Paul's Church H and Paul's Church age are not going to be able to judge our church we're going to be able to see the people who we live the people who we spoke to the people who we witness and they're never going to be able to say Lord how come you didn't tell me how come how come I didn't get a check how come I didn't know about the message that's on us that's on you that's on me brother Branham said he was talking to his wife it he asked as well he said honey yet what is true value and and then he answered his own question he said nothing but souls is the only thing that's got any value in it money passes away homes decay and go away everything in the earth moves away the only value lasting value he said I'd rather have one soul in glory that I won to Christ and to know and see that that this is powerful deep that light of God circles around that soul throughout all eternity my name to be associated with that he said I'd rather have that than to have every penny of money in the whole earth because I'd have to lose lose it all but what'd you send up there it's eternal and that's why we're trying friends there's a world out here friends brother Branham said when Jesus was on the earth only 1% of the people on the earth knew that God had visited the earth he said in our generation it's going to be 1/100 of 1% of the people in the world will ever know about the message you're a blessed people Framus yesterday we talked about Paul and everything he went through if you've got problems check your problems against Paul Paul was the son of God he was a man just like we are a human being just like you and I are and God personally visited him has God personally visited you do you have access to the divine library the supernatural library are you utilizing it are you growing are you learning are you cultivating that supernatural nature that's going to cause you to act like God would to do like God would do let your hands do what God's hands would do let your feet go where God's feet would do let your mouth speak what God's mouth would speak let your heart be what God's heart would be let's bar his friends Lord sometimes we just we just run to a point we want to go further we just put a comma Lord and just pick it up at the next service Lord I feel that enough has been said today and I pray that you would internalize into the hearts of your children what a sound mind is a sound mind is the mind of Christ Christ living in you Christ thinking for you Christ living for you Christ overcoming your problems your angel guiding you directing you father let the let the essence of the supernatural drop down in our congregation right now father and let this be a red-letter day let this be victory day father for somebody here that's gonna say Satan you have lied to me long enough you have deceived me you have trapped me you have tricked me but no more devil I'm burying you I'm putting rest in peace over your gravestone and every time you come and lie to me I'm going right to that grave don't say devil you are a liar you my father kicked you out of heaven and and now it's my responsibility to keep you under my feet we had a prophet tell us how to deal with the devil father we had a devil talk about the weapons of our warfare how to live in this world of insanity equip us today Lord I pray my friends if you're here today and you say Lord I need I need more of a sound mind I don't I don't want to be nervous I don't want to be frustrated I don't want to be confused I don't want to be depressed I need I need to make a precision decision today that the word is going to be my absolute the word is going to be my guide the message is going to overcome for me as I read it as I internalize it if that's you friends and again you know I don't care I never I never opened my eyes I just say if that's you friends and you want to say God just lift your hand up just a little bit and just drop it back down but just just enough brother Branham said that that's the supernatural act when you raise your hand it's a decision that you made and God sees your hand and I pray if you did raise your hand and if you want to let today be the springboard into your future eternal life you want to have that supernatural existence here on earth you want to be part of the super Church the super race of people part of God's super idea and you want to manifest the character and the love of God it's your privilege to do that so Lord you know the condition of every heart I pray that you had just fertilized their desire and give them passion to live the life that you have them to live we ask in Jesus name Amen you know a lot of people we talked about reading the church ages from cover
