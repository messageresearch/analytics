[1:00] Lord just give us what we have need of
[1:02] today we commit all things to you in the
[1:05] name of Jesus Christ amen amen this
[1:09] morning I take a thought on communion
[1:11] and uh I want to read from Genesis
[1:14] chapter
[1:16] 14 and beginning at verse
[1:20] 16 and speaking of Abraham and it says
[1:23] he brought back all the goods and also
[1:26] brought again his brother lot and his
[1:27] goods and the women also in the
[1:31] people and the king of Sodom went out to
[1:33] meet him after his return from the
[1:35] slaughter CH Lamar and of the kings that
[1:38] were with him at the valley of Shava
[1:40] which is as which is the King's Dale and
[1:43] mzc king of Salem brought forth what
[1:46] Bread and Wine and he was the priest of
[1:48] the most high God and he blessed him and
[1:50] said Blessed Be Abram of the most high
[1:52] god possessor of Heaven and Earth and
[1:54] blessed be the most high God which hath
[1:56] delivered thine enemies into thy hand
[1:59] and he gave ties of
[2:02] all and so this morning I want to I I
[2:05] believe that's the first time we we see
[2:07] the Bread and Wine mentioned there in
[2:09] the scripture talking about communion
[2:10] but uh brother BR speaking in the in the
[2:14] message remembering the Lord and this is
[2:17] a a quote I caught my attention I I I
[2:21] just like this and uh brother Ram says a
[2:24] communion with the Lord is like an oasis
[2:26] in the desert it's like the spring
[2:28] underneath the pond where the traveler
[2:31] coming by stops and drinks the water
[2:32] till he quenches his
[2:34] thirst he says Contin on coming by the
[2:38] order of his table we're the passing
[2:40] Pilgrim that's so journeying here on
[2:42] Earth with us together that we can come
[2:44] by his Table and there drink of His
[2:48] blessings and of his grace and of his
[2:49] word and fellowship around his word
[2:52] until our thirsty souls are satisfied
[2:55] then we are then when we leave the place
[2:59] of worship refreshed satisfied going out
[3:01] to meet the desert's problems again the
[3:04] problems of life's desert yes an oasis
[3:06] in the desert refreshing ourselves
[3:09] making
[3:10] ourself when we're
[3:12] thirsty he said it is with every true
[3:15] worshipper that they long to get
[3:18] together there's something about the
[3:19] fellowship that's Divine it's ordered of
[3:22] God it's holy it's sacred and the
[3:24] righteous are thirsting after it and
[3:28] then he was speaking of David you know I
[3:31] thirst after God like the heart for the
[3:33] water broke and you know just having a
[3:36] desire to get to that
[3:38] water and this morning you know I was
[3:40] thinking about communion and many times
[3:44] brother Brown talks about we we put the
[3:47] emphasis on the on the bread and the
[3:49] wine but you know brother R said it it's
[3:53] communion is to have fellowship and it's
[3:56] to have have to talk to God and have him
[3:59] talk to us and and that's real communion
[4:03] and when you speak about the
[4:06] communion when he starts to talk about
[4:09] having
[4:10] Fellowship brother brand talks one time
[4:13] he says he said we are Kings and Priests
[4:15] tonight and he was talking about Jesus
[4:19] being the son of man and he said the you
[4:21] know the birds have nest and the foxes
[4:23] have Den but the son of man has no place
[4:24] to lay his head and you know but but he
[4:28] knew who he was
[4:30] he had a he had a because of who he
[4:33] was he knew what his commission was what
[4:35] God had called him to do because he was
[4:37] God made flesh and and you know when he
[4:40] was here and brother R says he we're
[4:41] Kings and Priests tonight just like he
[4:43] was he said what different does it make
[4:46] whether we have or whether we
[4:48] haven't he said as long as we got
[4:51] God he said we are more than conquerors
[4:55] he said we are more than
[4:57] conquerors he said we sit in the
[4:59] presence of God In The Fellowship of the
[5:02] Holy Spirit taking spiritual communion
[5:05] from the hands of him that
[5:07] testified he said I was he that was dead
[5:10] and live again and I alive forever more
[5:15] he said sitting together in Heavenly
[5:16] places in Christ Jesus Oh blessed be the
[5:19] holy name he said what difference does
[5:21] it make and you know so I I want to look
[5:25] at that this morning and and maybe look
[5:28] at it some more and in the future but
[5:30] you know it's it's having communion with
[5:32] God and having this fellowship and and
[5:35] and thinking about you know we
[5:37] we look at the scripture there in in
[5:40] Genesis when it when it talks about
[5:43] Abraham and Abraham went forth to uh go
[5:47] after lot when when his brother was
[5:51] taken and you
[5:53] know something just stirred up inside of
[5:56] Abraham to go after his brother
[6:00] and you know he had a desire to go to
[6:01] restore his
[6:03] brother and you know to bring him back
[6:06] into
[6:08] Fellowship brother BR talked about you
[6:10] know he said if we don't have that
[6:12] desire to go after the ones that have L
[6:15] that's been gone that walk
[6:18] away he said you know we ought to be in
[6:20] the
[6:21] altar if we don't have that desire to go
[6:23] after our brother that's not in
[6:26] fellowship if we because you know here
[6:28] he was and you know it was by his lot's
[6:31] own choice to do that it brought him to
[6:34] that place but you know what lot didn't
[6:35] say well we'll just forget about
[6:38] him you know he's he's made his bed his
[6:40] line in
[6:42] it but lot but Abraham didn't have it
[6:45] didn't have that that thought he didn't
[6:47] act that way about it he knew that was
[6:50] his brother and he was in in a place
[6:53] that he needed to be restored from he
[6:55] needed to be
[6:57] rescued and he went after him
[7:00] and you know when when you look at all
[7:02] you all the the Kings and the the battle
[7:05] that was going on and here's here's
[7:08] Abraham but he had this desire to go
[7:10] after his brother and it was him and 318
[7:14] men and it's like you know it's like
[7:17] this great battle's taking place these
[7:18] Kings have come this armies have come to
[7:21] battle and Abraham's out there with
[7:24] 318 it's like well that you know that's
[7:27] a that's a great that's of great
[7:30] odds you've got these almost
[7:33] insurmountable odds of this great battle
[7:35] that you but you know what Abraham
[7:37] went and it's like well it looks really
[7:40] bad but you know that that doesn't
[7:42] change the fact that if that if we are a
[7:45] part of God if we have a brother or
[7:47] sister that's Fallen you know no matter
[7:48] what condition they're in you know what
[7:50] as long as they're still drawing breath
[7:52] then you know what there's still Mercy
[7:54] there's still Grace there so no matter
[7:56] what the condition is it's our it's our
[8:01] responsibility to lift them up to go
[8:03] after them you know and to those that
[8:06] have fallen by the because you know what
[8:08] we've all Fallen by the wayside we've
[8:10] all stumbled we've all failed we all
[8:13] needed to be uh restored yes right you
[8:18] know and and it because many times we
[8:21] look at people in the condition that
[8:23] they went through it's like there but
[8:25] for the grace of God go
[8:26] I that that I see the condition that
[8:29] people are in and I want them to be
[8:31] restored I want them to be the at the
[8:33] best place that they can be at what God
[8:35] has for
[8:37] them and it takes you and I to come in
[8:40] to be in
[8:41] Fellowship to come to that
[8:44] place and you know one of the things
[8:47] that and so you know here he is when he
[8:49] returns you know mzc meets him and
[8:51] brings him the uh the oil and the wine
[8:54] or the bread and the wine and he comes
[8:56] and you know he has fellowship and He
[8:57] blesses Abraham
[9:00] but you know it when when you see this
[9:04] taking
[9:05] place you know it it it has
[9:08] to um have you have to have Fellowship
[9:12] to come together we all have to be one
[9:16] right you know one one of the things I
[9:18] was I was reading that and one of the
[9:21] things I I was thinking about was you
[9:23] know you know when it comes to
[9:28] communion and communion has in
[9:32] fellowship and you here where brother
[9:33] Brown talks about us coming to the table
[9:36] and eating well this morning there's a
[9:38] table spread where we're eating this
[9:40] morning right we're having spiritual
[9:42] communion this morning with
[9:45] him and you know and
[9:50] everybody what what struck me was you
[9:52] know lots of times people's like well
[9:54] you know I can I can do it on my own I'm
[9:58] okay and it's like no you're no you
[10:00] can't right and you know when you look
[10:04] at all the times when he talks about
[10:06] having communion even brother speaking
[10:08] here you know even when Jesus had all
[10:10] the disciples together at the table and
[10:12] they were eating when he broke the bread
[10:15] you know it was it was they had to come
[10:17] together to do that and and mzc come to
[10:21] Abraham and you know it's like because
[10:25] you can have Fellowship but it's so
[10:27] important to come together
[10:30] amen because you know what you can't
[10:31] have communion by
[10:35] yourself you know because when when
[10:37] because even in the communion scripture
[10:40] when when you read that and you see
[10:43] where it says you know when we come
[10:45] together and we T together we t with one
[10:48] another in the in this communion because
[10:51] it's not it's not something that you do
[10:53] solo it's not something you do by
[10:56] yourself now I know I know we commun
[10:59] with God on a in a in at times where
[11:02] it's just you and him it's just you and
[11:05] God and you're
[11:07] fellowshipping but you know what you
[11:09] can't you can't forsake the assembling
[11:12] amen it you it requires all of us to be
[11:16] together and you know it's like all of
[11:19] us having that desire to come together
[11:21] to Fellowship to have it we're we're
[11:24] here together because you know when you
[11:27] when you miss out
[11:29] it really it takes away from because you
[11:32] can listen to the
[11:34] sermons and it does and I've been
[11:37] blessed by it but you know what there's
[11:40] nothing that'll take the place of being
[11:43] here with your brothers and sisters
[11:45] being in this
[11:46] building and being in the house of God
[11:49] and fellowshipping one with
[11:51] another because you know what you you
[11:54] gain strength from one another when you
[11:57] bring your lick of fire and and I bring
[11:59] my lick of fire then you know what we
[12:01] know that God we'll hear from God this
[12:04] morning why because he said whether two
[12:06] or three are gathered in my name he said
[12:08] I'm they're in the midst
[12:10] right and so when we commune see we want
[12:14] to talk to
[12:15] God but you know this morning I many
[12:19] times we we
[12:21] pray and I'm guilty of this myself you
[12:24] know we pray and we just want to talk to
[12:26] God it's just like we just want to
[12:27] unload
[12:29] and then when we get empty we feel like
[12:31] well I've got that off my chest and then
[12:33] we
[12:35] stop and you know it's you know how how
[12:40] difficult it is or how terrible it is if
[12:42] you have a relationship with somebody
[12:45] and all you want to do is talk the whole
[12:46] time and you never want to
[12:50] listen you know because if you if you're
[12:53] if you're married and and and your and
[12:56] your husband does all the talking and
[12:58] and you you never and and you like well
[13:00] you know what why don't you be quiet for
[13:01] a minute so I can
[13:04] talk and it feels like you know because
[13:06] they're not they're not important
[13:09] because you don't take the time to
[13:10] listen to what they have to
[13:13] say and sometimes it's the wife you know
[13:16] she's just because things build up and
[13:19] it's just
[13:20] like I want to
[13:23] listen I want you to listen to what I
[13:25] got to
[13:26] say and sometimes you know because
[13:29] when we pray it's just like you unload
[13:32] and it's like well I'm done and we
[13:34] failed to take the time to say well Lord
[13:36] what you got to say to
[13:39] me it's like look I I want to I want to
[13:43] communicate I want to speak to you but I
[13:45] want you to speak to
[13:47] me and sometimes it's very hard because
[13:50] when you go through difficult situations
[13:52] and times and you know you you just feel
[13:54] like you got so much to unload and you
[13:56] get all this off your chest and when the
[13:58] Lord speaks to you sometimes the Lord
[14:00] tells you things that you don't want to
[14:02] hear and it's just like do I hear that
[14:06] right it's like why
[14:10] Lord and it's just like we we feel like
[14:12] we're we get so burdened but overloaded
[14:16] but you know God knows what he's doing
[14:20] amen and he has and he has the best for
[14:22] us and sometimes you know we don't see
[14:24] we don't see
[14:26] everything but you know if we just trust
[14:29] in him when he speaks to us he always
[14:31] speaks the right answer
[14:33] amen see it's to talk it's to
[14:36] communicate to speak
[14:38] back he said that's communing is being
[14:42] able to speak to one another and so he
[14:45] was speaking of the of the the bread and
[14:48] the wine see he said it's the real
[14:52] communion is the holy spirit speaking
[14:54] back to us he said when you ask him then
[14:57] he speaks back back that is correct
[15:01] communion to be able to commune and let
[15:03] him speak
[15:05] back and talk
[15:07] to and have him talk back to us to speak
[15:11] he said I think that's some of the Bless
[15:13] The Most Blessed time of the
[15:17] services he said every hour of our life
[15:20] ought to be a communion when he is
[15:22] speaking back to
[15:26] us and and this is from possessing all
[15:29] things brother BR says not to commune
[15:31] you commune as you eat with one
[15:34] another he said just commune with God
[15:37] the communion is not the bread not the
[15:38] wine he said the communion is talking
[15:41] back and forth with
[15:44] God he said
[15:47] see he said this is the symbol that we
[15:50] take that we believe in his death broken
[15:52] body his burial his resurrection we
[15:54] believe in the presence of the Holy
[15:56] Spirit and we believe that he has give
[15:58] us eternal life and we cannot die we
[16:00] have passed passed from death into life
[16:02] and someday when we separate from one
[16:04] another here we'll rise again in the
[16:06] resurrection with each other joined
[16:08] together with Christ Jesus as a
[16:12] body so he's amen upon this basis and
[16:15] upon the confession of my sins he
[16:18] said we take these
[16:21] articles of these things because we we
[16:25] know that based on this we're communing
[16:27] with each other but it's not just the
[16:29] Bread and Wine but we eating the
[16:31] together
[16:33] here and we we take these things that
[16:35] are given to us in
[16:38] Fellowship brother R says communion
[16:41] communion also means
[16:43] Thanksgiving giving thanks to God for
[16:45] the things that he's
[16:47] done and he says because he he was
[16:50] talking here in in the message the key
[16:52] to the
[16:53] door and he was talking about you know
[16:57] the Catholics taking
[16:59] communion and you know they're they're
[17:01] hoping for something because they're
[17:04] they're hoping that something takes
[17:06] place but you know what a Believer
[17:09] shouldn't no one should be taking
[17:11] communion unless they've passed from
[17:13] death into
[17:14] life right and see when when see they're
[17:18] he said they're taking communion praying
[17:21] for and hoping that something's going to
[17:23] take place that they that this is going
[17:25] to happen but we take communion as
[17:30] commemoration that you know what we have
[17:31] passed from Death unto life that's
[17:34] something that he's already something
[17:36] that's already been done for us and we
[17:39] see this because it's it's a
[17:41] commemoration of what he's done for us
[17:43] but it's a commemoration of what takes
[17:45] place should be taking place every
[17:47] single day that we commune with him that
[17:50] we're eating the bread of life because
[17:52] he is the bread of life and we should be
[17:55] eating of that every single day and
[17:57] brother r speaking here and he was
[17:59] talking about being
[18:01] Beggars he said we're all
[18:04] Beggars he said it's just like this he
[18:06] said one is a beggar hoping that
[18:08] everything's all right see the other one
[18:10] is a beggar thanking God for what's
[18:12] already been done he said they're both
[18:15] Beggars not one is begging hoping but
[18:17] one is begging hoping he'll get it the
[18:19] other beggar knows he's got it and
[18:21] thanked him for giv it to him he said no
[18:24] there's the difference that's communion
[18:26] yes sir one is hoping that he's forgiven
[18:28] the other one knows he's forgiven and
[18:30] giving thanks for it why because we were
[18:34] Beggars we didn't have anything in this
[18:36] life everything that we have came from
[18:39] God but you know what God brought us to
[18:42] the place we are
[18:43] today and to have true communion is to
[18:46] give thanks to God for what he's given
[18:48] us where he's brought us to what he's
[18:50] brought us
[18:52] from see we have communion with
[18:56] him he says
[19:00] speaking of of mesic see he said after
[19:03] after this battle is taking
[19:07] place so you there's an overcoming that
[19:10] has to take place in your life he said
[19:13] when you when you come to that place
[19:14] then you receive communion with
[19:18] God and you know I know many times
[19:20] brother BR talks about communion when
[19:22] this when this battle Earthly battle is
[19:23] all over with but you know when there's
[19:26] there's a battle that you have to fight
[19:28] to
[19:30] overcome and when you overcome you got
[19:33] to press your way into the kingdom the
[19:35] new birth is a battle and you've got to
[19:38] fight your way in but he said after that
[19:41] you receive he said he gives you a part
[19:43] of himself he said become the communion
[19:47] because communion is part of Christ he
[19:49] said after the struggle is after you've
[19:51] done got yourself whed out then is when
[19:54] you partake of Christ become part of his
[19:57] being
[19:58] you see it so then there is that part of
[20:01] it when you've battled it out there's a
[20:03] battle that takes place inside of you
[20:05] that you've got to
[20:06] overcome and then there's communion with
[20:09] him that he comes to you that you become
[20:12] you receive a part of him well if you've
[20:15] received a part of him then when we take
[20:17] communion that is that is showing that
[20:20] we've
[20:22] overcome and that we have taken a part
[20:24] of him that we've received a part of him
[20:27] through that overcoming just as Abraham
[20:30] did we've wrestled it out and we've
[20:32] become a part of God and then we are
[20:36] able to partake of that
[20:39] communion when the battle is over and
[20:42] the Victory is won see then we able to
[20:45] come out and receive a part of him we
[20:47] have communion that's the way that we
[20:49] have communion with
[20:52] God and brother R talks about the wine
[20:55] coming into fellowship with God
[20:58] see he says the wine he said wine gets
[21:02] stronger better and stronger as it gets
[21:04] older he said it never loses its
[21:07] strength so when we receive that you
[21:10] know praise God it never gets it never
[21:12] gets weaker it only gets stronger it
[21:14] only gets better he said the blood of
[21:16] Christ doesn't sour and spoil it but it
[21:18] gets older as it gets older it gets
[21:20] stronger and better as the days go by to
[21:23] the believer and he says he said it is a
[21:27] literal wine and bread communion bread
[21:30] should be made by those that is
[21:33] dedicated to themselves and consecrated
[21:36] themselves but see the wine gets better
[21:38] it doesn't lose in strength because it's
[21:40] a type of the blood of Christ and so it
[21:43] doesn't as it never gets weaker the
[21:46] blood will never lose its power what
[21:49] it's all what it's been able to do in
[21:51] the past it will always be able to do
[21:53] amen and it and the believer it ought to
[21:56] get better and stronger
[21:59] and so when you see how the the the
[22:00] bread was a broken body showing the body
[22:03] was broken for
[22:04] us that bread was broken even in even in
[22:08] the Old Testament brother M talks about
[22:09] the shoe bread in the Old Testament he
[22:12] said there was three pieces of bread
[22:13] there and he said that middle piece was
[22:15] broken and the shoe bread and he said
[22:18] that that middle piece was broken
[22:19] showing that Christ was broken because
[22:22] he had to come between us and God and
[22:24] there was a piece that was
[22:26] broken why because that piece
[22:28] represented the the chasm that was
[22:31] between us that was something that had
[22:32] to cover between us to bring us back
[22:35] into Fellowship there was one that was
[22:37] broken for us to bring us back and we've
[22:41] come back into Fellowship see and we see
[22:44] it's a broken body it was he was broken
[22:46] at Calvary to be our prici for our sins
[22:50] he said through his righteousness we
[22:51] might become his righteousness he said
[22:54] because he became our sin that we might
[22:56] become his righteous
[22:59] he said brother that's purely Grace so
[23:02] when we see what God has done for us how
[23:05] we've come it back he's brought us back
[23:07] into Fellowship through the through his
[23:11] work at Calvary what he's done and now
[23:14] we've been able to receive that yes the
[23:17] very life of Jesus
[23:19] Christ you know and and so if you have
[23:22] received that that you want to have
[23:24] fellowship with
[23:26] God and how can how can you not have
[23:29] fellowship with God and not want to have
[23:31] fellowship with your brothers and
[23:33] sisters want not you know to have
[23:35] Fellowship to be here and to Fellowship
[23:38] around the word
[23:40] right because that's that's the greatest
[23:43] thing that we can
[23:45] do if we want to draw closer to God then
[23:48] how can how can we get closer to God if
[23:50] we can't get closer to our brothers and
[23:53] sisters and see that's that's where the
[23:56] devil wants to try to hinder us
[23:58] is to get in and try to hinder your
[24:01] brother or sister try to hinder you
[24:03] always try to put something between you
[24:05] and your brother always something
[24:07] between you and your
[24:08] sister and see you can't have you can't
[24:10] have right fellowship with God if
[24:13] there's if there's a
[24:15] problem the scripture tells us that you
[24:17] know if we know our brother's got an ALT
[24:19] against us you know we need to go take
[24:21] care of that
[24:23] right even even if somebody even if we
[24:26] think there's a problem
[24:29] you know not not to let something just
[24:31] just build up and and let somebody let
[24:33] something
[24:35] faster it's like well if if you've if
[24:38] you've been wrong and you don't ever try
[24:40] to to clear that up if you don't ever
[24:43] try to take care of that you know the
[24:44] devil stays right there and it always
[24:46] plays in your mind with that one thought
[24:49] and he will always hinder you with
[24:52] that and you know and the thing is is if
[24:55] if your brother or sister has a has a
[24:57] all again you and whether whether you
[24:59] done anything wrong or not I always
[25:01] appreciate brother brother Dale always
[25:03] saying you know he said if you ever come
[25:04] to me and you got a problem he said I'll
[25:06] apologize whether I done anything wrong
[25:07] or not right why because you know it's
[25:11] just easier to do
[25:13] that and you know it's like well I'm
[25:15] sorry if if I if I offended you in some
[25:17] way then you know what I don't mind
[25:19] taking care of that because you know
[25:20] what it it'll it'll help me and
[25:24] you and then you know we can we can have
[25:27] communion with with God because as long
[25:29] as there's something that lays there
[25:30] that's always going to be a problem
[25:32] you're never going to get beyond that
[25:34] point that's always going to be
[25:35] someplace that's going to hinder
[25:39] you but you know if we if we know how to
[25:43] he said if you and this is from faith is
[25:46] our Victory he says he said oh you can't
[25:49] purpose anything of God's promise in
[25:51] your heart without finding the reality
[25:53] to it he said if your soul has been
[25:56] tormented by sins and doubts and ups and
[25:58] downs and frustrations and there's
[26:00] something down in you that's telling you
[26:03] that there's somewhere that you can
[26:05] overcome
[26:08] that and we'll have the let the
[26:10] musicians come on come forward he says
[26:12] why don't he said why do you float
[26:14] around then from church to church and
[26:15] from place to place he said just deal

[27:08] right Spirit about
[27:10] it whether I agree with it or not that's
