========================================

God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen and we had a wonderful time yesterday and uh youth meetings are for The Young and the old one one day we're going to go to the a youth meeting in the air and we're it's going to be we we'll be young again see all these gray hairs and everything they'll all be gone I'll be taken care of Amen let's go to the Lord in prayer before we get into our study Lord we're so so thankful for your for your word thank you Lord for the that the prophet's message that we were just listening to to restore our hearts back to the original faith I pray God that you'll prepare our hearts this morning for the word that you have in store for us today we come expecting Lord Jesus we come expected to receive something help us Lord Jesus we pray in your name amen so we've been kind of meditating on what is what is that Jean seed um cuz that was the topic of the last Minister's meeting and just kind of Tak taking that and just wanted to meditate on it for a few Sundays and uh thinking about um that scripture in Romans chapter 9 verse 13 that says Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and uh which is Paul's quoting from Malachi chapter 1 that says I have loved you sayith the Lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his her is Wass for the dragons of the Wilderness and brother brandham would lay lay lay the framework for these things that that this is a an eternal thought that God we know the thoughts of God they're not changing like our thoughts that you know one day you can think of a different I think I I think I'll apply for a job over here I think that I need to do this one day but God's thoughts are permanent and unchanging and his thoughts of of of if if you've got eternal life today or you ever will have eternal life it's not even just a thought like a thought that we would have but it's an actual and attribute of God it's part of him and so he expresses that he expresses these attributes by the Spoken Word by speaking it out and so you think about that the spoken word uh that we're hearing is actually expressing the thought of that he had before the foundation of the world of you that that you would have eternal life and that you would be conformed to the image of the Son of God and that you would be conformed to maturity and so the word that we're hearing is actually bringing us back to the thought that God had and so you know we think of think about sit up on the mountain top and think about that sometime sit under the old Apple Tree amen sit open your Bible in the morning with your coffee or whatever and think that God knew you before the foundation of the world and it's not just something something that just popped into his mind no sir but he always knew that you would want it and he had in his in his mind uh just the same way that he knew that one day he would die on the cross the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and that same way that he knew that was going to happen he knew that you would want the word and you would respond to it and it was something that was it didn't pop into his head it was always there so much that it's actually a part of him now when we think about part of him we're talking about like you know your your your jeans are you know uh the jeans that you're expressing your hair color your your skin color your characteristics all of those things are part part of you and you're expressing those those genes as as you're born as a little baby in the natural and you keep growing up you you you express the characteristics of your mother and father so God is expressing you are actually an expression of a part of God as you hear the word you're actually expressing the thought that or the attribute the thing of God that he wanted to express in this world that's a that's a pretty big that's a pretty big thought to think about amen it's almost mindblowing in Isaiah 46 it says that's this is a wonderful quote to hang on to scripture remember the former things of old for I am God and there's none else I'm God and there's none like me declaring the end from the beginning now you think about the characteristic of God that he knows everything that's ever going to happen he's sitting outside of time and can observe the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure so so what that means that put yourself in there that he knows the day and the hour that you're living in he knew what uh what kind of a sermon to preach for you to kind of you feel that like brother R was just saying the Deep call into the deep amen yeah and and and and and for you to respond so improving his word he said his forn knowledge know what you would do so let's kind of examine that what that means is his forn knowledge allows him to understand people's characters their inclinations and their responses to Divine matters even before they are born so we're framing up like Jacob and Esau he knew Jacob would would rather have that uh the birthright than the bowl of M suit so forn knowledge includes knowing who will bear the character of Christ and who won't so maybe just step back look over the banister of time like God and and and and it's like him peering down through all of history and and all the different people all the different possibilities and he sees you and I know you're going to want it y so thereby knowing that looking at it by for knowledge then he can predestinate amen then he's going to have a an angel in the the seventh Church age then he's going to have a a Ministry he's going to have a church waiting for you all those kind of things he can he can organize I'm I'm going to put this person in this family I'm going to have this person maybe they don't know anything about the Lord so I'm going to have them marry this person and everything is arranged because he's looking at your character and and then it all works out like that by for knowledge he knowed what you would do by for knowledge he knew see now that he's looking at the characteristics of the individual now frame it up like this because he knew Jacob and he knew Esau he knew that you wherever you put Jacob he's always going to respond and I like like brother Brown said if if he uh if you want to know how you would respond in any other Church age look how you respond in this age how you responding right now because it's it's who you are so if you put Jacob in the days of Malachi or the days of Daniel or the days of Micah or whatever it's as who he is he's always going to respond amen my for line is he knew that Esau was a Shyer and he knew that Jacob would respect that birth right now it you ever stop to just Ponder these things like Esau what are you thinking you'd rather have a bowl of little soup yeah than the birthright right the birthright tying in to one day that you're going to bring forth the Messiah amen that that line one day that that that the Messiah is going to come forth and and restores back to all things and everything and he'd rather have that bowl of L soup and the moment it seemed good like God looking down from eternity knew that Esau would rather have that bowl of little soup so he he knew he knew how he was going to respond and what a strange thing too now just just Ponder on these things that Esau looked outwardly like the he he took care of his daddy he was like the better son the the good he was the good one yeah and Jacob was like a little mama's boy what what do you you know so many things that you would look at his life and like what it looks like Esau in the natural is is better but Jacob had so many faults in things but yet what God was looking at do you do you want it do you want do you want to be tied into the into the manifestation of the attribute of God Amen so so there's where jaob value was is he he was he was a he manifested the thought of God that God had about him before the foundation of the world so we got all these scriptures I know they're a little bit small but I'll just read through them in Romans 8 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate amen and there's there's that scripture that we preach that's your purpose if you want to know what your purpose is you were because you were forone you're predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son well I don't know what I'm doing here there's there's your scripture I don't know what I'm I don't know why I'm coming to church that's it right there Ephesians 1: 14:5 says according as Heath chosen us us in him before the foundation of the world but that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself so so he knew that you would want it and so therefore because his attributes are Eternal that you're part of him so therefore you're chosen in him because you're always you always were part of him so when he manifested himself on the earth and died then he those attributes that were always in him could be expressed now but before the foundation of the world you're already you're chosen in him you're part of him in 2 Timothy 1:9 who ha saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to your works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ when before the world began in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 says but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so we're we're we're living out in time right now what God always knew would happen we're we're manifesting in time an eternal truth that that you always were Eternal because God always knew that you you want it it's it's not something that it's like going to slip away oh I better better be careful I'm going to lose this one no he said I'm not going to lose one Lord nobody nobody's going to slip out of his grasp it's a it's a constant thing that God now aren't you glad of that kind of assurance that if he thought of you he's not going to lose you that's why in John 6:37 we've got that promise that all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out so uh these attributes of God it's you know they can be expressed in a book it's like and that's the Lamb's Book of Life a section of the book of life that's Eternal because it it's like a list a list of names and and if you want to find out if your name if your name is in the book then you look back to the book because the book is actually expressing those names that's why when we read these stories of Ruth and and and and Esther and we we start identifying ourself with the word that's how we recognize our we recognize that we're in the book not that not that your name is right like Jacob it it'd be nice if your name was listed out like Jacob Jacob Bob have I loved way have I loved something like that but it's not it's not expressed like that in the word but you can still identify yourself because you go through the same Journey you go through the same uh experiences you can identify yourself when when you read when you read about Daniel crying on his bed at night you read you read about Solomon you read about all these story they're expressing attributes and characteristics that you can identify with and you you've been through the same thing when you read about on the day of Pentecost and the journey of the Believers in Acts and signs and one's follow wonders following you begin to identify yourself with that amen and it's it's it's God actually showing you and revealing to you that because as you hear the word and you're you become the word expressed and you identify yourself back with the word he show he's he's revealing to you that you're part of it in 2 Timothy 1:9 who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given in Christ before the world began so so God's thoughts are not just abstract or fleeting ideas but rather the very Foundation of all reality that's God's thoughts are the starting point of everything in existence he thought it then he spoke it the sun came into the existence he thought it and he spoke it and this the galaxies were spun off and he thought it and he spoke it and now and there's a quote he thought it he spoke it and now here you are he thought it and he spoke it and here you are so the we're coming in church is not just in vain but it we're actually as you hear the word is actually something Supernatural is taking place that Eternal thought that God had about you from before the foundation of the world is now expressing in you right now so so then we can identify ourselves that the life the supernatural life that we're living right now is that thought that God had before the foundation of the world that's and that positionally places us and that gives us identity and when you can start identifying yourself with the word and that gives you confidence you don't you don't have you don't have anything to prove anymore you you know maybe maybe early on in your spiritual journey you you had a lot to prove I I want to prove that I'm born again I want to prove that I'm called I want to prove this or that I want to prove I'm in the right church I want to prove this and that but when you begin to get placed you don't have nothing to prove anymore because it identifies you back and you can see I I I I know I know where I stand amen amen so so uh those who are part of God's Eternal plan those who have eternal life are not just mere thoughts but attributes of God they are reflections of God's Eternal nature and purpose brother R would say and sir we would we would see Jesus he said in the beginning God was not even God he was the great Eternal and in there was attributes attributes was his thoughts and then he become a word like this and a word expressed well a thought expressed is a word a word expressed is a thought and then remember if if you ever wasn't God's thinking you'll always be there amen if you've got eternal life you are the expression of the attribute of his thought for this age amen there's only one eternal life and it always existed and you and his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks is what God Eternal you always was see in his thinking now now that's not that's not a quote that to fall asleep on that's a quote to get excited about that when I read something like that I that that makes me happy that's right amen amen yeah when you get down you you you start thinking about that in the shower in the morning or when you when you know every the world's ganging up on you God always had me on his mind and the identification of Christ in all ages he said man I break it down in the beginning was the eternal he wasn't even God God our English word is an object of worship but he there wasn't nothing to worship him he was just the Eternal in him was attributes anyone knows what an attribute is in other words in him was his thoughts just thoughts that's his attribute then is word and a thought expressed is a word in the beginning was the word before it was even expressed it was a thought attributes now see what he's trying to frame up in our minds is to get away from that thought that God has thoughts like we do yeah well I'm thinking about this I think it'd be a great idea to save brother Ryan I think it no it's not like that it's it's constant so much that his thoughts about of you those Eternal thoughts of the the eternal life that you're going to receive here in time are a constant they're part of him amen right and I keep reiterating that so that so that yeah I hope we'll we'll kind of get it it impress upon us and brother R want say think of it before Jesus was ever born 4,000 years before he came on Earth and several thousand years before you come on Earth Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world and the Book of Life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world and brother brother R you can go read it how did he put your name on The Book of Life he spoke it that's the Bible truth see your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world before anything was anything happened your name was already inscribed in the in the in in the Eternal attributes of God it was it was part of him and and and so being that is eternal then it's already finished it it it's already it's already done like he thought of it he thought of Jesus of himself coming down and expressing himself in flesh and DED on the cross well it's already done in Revelation 13 it says all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the L Book of Life of the lamb slain from before the from the foundation of the world so the view from eternity is always that a Christian does not become God's child at the moment of your birth but I'm talking about the view from eternity amen I got this we're swimming in deep water here a little bit good good but the new birth manifest in time like it it expresses right in time what was spiritually true all the way from the beginning now now that's why that's why Paul could say because you are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father amen because from the view from eternity you're already sons and that's why he could say before the foundation of the world Jacob have I loved and Esau have I ha it because it's already the scroll is already unrolled out in God's mind you think you think in God's mind he's not just looking up to Le osia he's looking all the way to the white Throne judgment we're looking all the way past that all the way past that all the way past past past amen everything he sees it's already done in his mind amen amen so in John chapter 10 he could say my sheep hear my voice and I know them oh you think you know we come to church and the word's being preached and the minister doesn't know who's going to going to respond or whatever but God already knows to the point when God was manifest in flesh and he he went around calling philli and Nathaniel and Peter he knew that they would respond to the point he he knew who he could walk up to I'll make you Fishers of Men he he could call and and brother there's a statement where he said that he he could call them by name because he knew he knew there that they were his Sheep amen and he said I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand now now keep in mind the context of what we're talking about we're talking about what what is that Jean seed when brother R said down in your soul you've got something it always was there and the thing in man's filter it always was there you what it is that that there's something that's tied to you there's the thought of God is always thinking about you and there's a potential in your life that you are going to come to and you cannot Escape it because it's who you are God is looking at your characteristics just like he was looking at Jacob and you're going to come to that potential that he saw before the foundation of the world am and that potential is manifested by hearing the word amen so you hear the word he knew that one day you would hear the word and you would receive the word and the word that you heard would Quicken and Blossom into life and what's it quickening the thought that God had before the foundation of the world now is expressed and now it's a reality and that's why brother R said talking about the woman at the well he said there was that predestinated seed down in there and he said what is it it's the thought of God the thought of God that God had before the foundation of the world now it it's it's uh you you begin to meditate on these things and you realize that sometimes the things that brother Ram said are difficult to understand but really there's no other way for him to say it that's right when it's all said and done he said it so perfectly to express this this thing that it's almost how are you going to explain it any other way right Jesus going around calling his disciples he saith unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men he knew exactly he would respond so what's the summation of the matters we're about to close just here in a few minutes you as a child of God or an Inseparable part of the genes of God and the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he said before there was even a moon stars or a molecule you are Sons and Daughters of God for you are the are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning amen now there there's an identification when you begin to recognize that what you're living out right now that the eternal life in you really does tie back Amen to the thought that God had before the foundation of the world Amen that right now you are expressing what God thought of Amen that all all of these things that we read about in the scripture in Malachi that that one day that there's going to be a people that are their hearts are turned back that there's going to be a people that can tell uh in in the last days can discern the true and the false all these things that are written of in the scripture now you are expressing that that's why in Christ is revealed in his own word he said if we are Sons and Daughters of God then we are attributes of God Amen now there's the if if if we're Sons and Daughters of God if we've got that eternal life in us then we are attributes of God then we got eternal life and God is the only eternal life there is amen then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were a part of him then amen there you are amen when that's in there there is no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the ti poost of the Soul why did he say no devil no powers can never move it yeah Jesus had Jesus had power over the devil cuz he knew who he was and so your identity gives you power over the devil so that's why this is so important when you know that you are the manifested expressed thought of God then it gives you power over the devil because you can stand like Jesus did who is the word and you can say I I listen devil you can't tell me that I'm not born again and and As We Roll Along you can't tell me that I'm not an adopted manifested son of God you can't tell me that I'm not the Fulfillment of what the word says the bride will be in this last day you can't tell me and that's that that's that's we're coming to Identity so what what is a gene a gene is like all these characteristics that now are expressing we talked about that I'm going to skip past that so um here's that quote and we'll stop on this when brother R said in the in this church age that it's not the person here's another quote that's kind of worded in an odd way what does this mean it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and neither was born and neither had done good or evil that's right I thought we just got through saying that you're predestinated eternally but now think about this yeah that you as an individual you ain't you ain't nothing without the word it's the word the Eternal thought the attribute that God thought of before the foundation of the world and God knew that one day you would hear that word and the word you would drop down in your heart and that would be predestinated eternally but you just as a an individual floating alone in your sinful condition you you're without the word you're not predestinated eternally but when the word drops in your heart then in that now you're CAU up to what God thought of and now you continue along that trajectory so we could say that it's the seed word that comes predestinated eternally but when that seed lives in a person the person is part of God's plan and you're caught up into the Eternal and we'll stop right there God bless you [Applause]
