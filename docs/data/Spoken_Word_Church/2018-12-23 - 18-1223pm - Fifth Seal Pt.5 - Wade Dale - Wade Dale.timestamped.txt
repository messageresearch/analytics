[19:28] something for us hey man if you got your
[19:30] Bibles let's turn to the Book of
[19:31] Revelations and get started and I'm
[19:36] gonna background a little bit for the
[19:38] for the sake of our of our dear brothers
[19:41] and sisters that come over all the way
[19:43] from there from Arizona New Mexico to be
[19:46] with us so well and that's okay so many
[19:49] of you said you enjoyed Wednesday night
[19:50] I thought I kind of muddled it up a
[19:52] little bit but I some of you some of
[19:54] you've already come in about enjoying it
[19:56] so we're gonna kind of cover a little
[19:58] bit more today but there's more to that
[19:59] fifth seal than just the fifth seal Jude
[20:01] that's why I said that once that seal
[20:04] opens that when the seal comes off it's
[20:08] okay to know what that seal was but I
[20:11] want to know what it sealed up it sealed
[20:14] up something that we couldn't previously
[20:16] see like I said the last week and the
[20:19] week before last this is the
[20:22] and we've been going in you see what
[20:26] it's got us we're still here we need to
[20:30] go in that direction it's not Mama's
[20:34] walking on the streets to go with Jesus
[20:35] now no she's in the sixth dimension
[20:37] she's in a theophany and she's waiting
[20:39] on us to bring her back here
[20:41] hey ma'am we're not floating on a cloud
[20:44] playing hearts amen well that's what we
[20:48] thought here no matter what we thought
[20:50] father son Holy Ghost was the right
[20:52] baptism Trinity was right and the first
[20:58] seal was the Holy Ghost now every bit of
[21:01] that was not right going in that
[21:04] direction we got to go in that direction
[21:06] we got to change our way of thinking
[21:09] just like I told you many times about
[21:11] all the you praying for the sick and all
[21:14] that and that's fine but it's what's it
[21:17] got us we're still here we need to do
[21:23] something and yet say well you gonna
[21:25] trying to manufacture something I'd
[21:26] rather have a little fire the property
[21:29] God said then no fire at all because I I
[21:32] don't know about you but when somebody
[21:36] like brother Lyle that I've known for 30
[21:38] years or longer brother dick now they've
[21:41] come down to the last part of their
[21:45] journey and you see brother I'll have to
[21:48] walk up here with a walker that gets me
[21:51] people right here that don't get me in
[21:54] my spirit realm that gets me in my soul
[21:56] that makes my soul when our soul starts
[21:59] longing after these things and groaning
[22:02] and travailing waiting for the
[22:03] manifestation of the sons of God will
[22:06] quit drinking milk will start eating
[22:08] some meat amen
[22:09] it's good day it's good to drink milk
[22:12] milk it's okay Danny of milks okay I've
[22:15] never eaten one I've never drank milk
[22:16] with a snake and eagles don't eat don't
[22:21] drink milk Eagle starts out eating meat
[22:25] mommy eagle just got to chew it up so
[22:28] they don't choke but it's still meat so
[22:31] I think we need to eat meat
[22:34] every meal revelation 6 verse 1 verse 9
[22:38] we're going to start on the fifth seal
[22:39] this is part 5 but we got to get a few
[22:42] things out of the way before we can
[22:45] start and we'll start a little bit with
[22:46] the Thunder underneath this seal but
[22:49] we're gonna have to cover this will be
[22:52] transgression part 2 because there is a
[22:54] place where Israel fell from - from a
[22:59] place to a place when we read that
[23:01] Sunday but we're I mean Wednesday but
[23:03] we're gonna read it again if that's all
[23:05] right we're gonna do a lot of Bible
[23:07] reading today and I hope that's alright
[23:10] man cuz like brother Dale said we we got
[23:14] to see all these things come to pass
[23:15] they've been written on paper for 1,500
[23:18] years they've been in the mind of God
[23:20] since he turned sins back and for
[23:22] eternity before the eternal but they've
[23:26] got to be literally you know what Jesus
[23:28] stood as a lamb slain before the
[23:29] foundation of the world right but he had
[23:32] to literally come down here and do it if
[23:35] it stay in the mind - God wouldn't do us
[23:37] any good he had to come down here in
[23:38] this dimension die the death do exactly
[23:41] what the word says and he's doing
[23:44] exactly what the word says now so let's
[23:46] see revelations 6 and let's pray before
[23:49] we get started this 15 the Lord thank
[23:52] you for the day think for the hour that
[23:54] we're living thank you for the greatest
[23:56] people that ever walked on the face of
[23:57] this earth they sitting in this building
[23:59] tonight father I pray that you just be
[24:02] with us now be the active participant in
[24:04] this service you do the speaking you do
[24:06] the revealing because without you Lord
[24:08] it'll be just a meeting of minds father
[24:11] just be with the ones that are sick
[24:12] raise them up for your honor and glory
[24:14] Lord we know sometimes our body gets a
[24:16] little bug and it has to get rid of it
[24:18] we know that the Prophet told us that
[24:20] many times but Lord you're the healer
[24:22] you're the one that does that but you're
[24:24] also the protector you're the one that
[24:27] as we prayed this morning that will keep
[24:28] it from coming on us Lord I pray this
[24:31] you'd just be with us now and just cover
[24:33] this congregation with the veil of the
[24:35] Holy Ghost then our minds and our
[24:37] thoughts will be on you just for this
[24:39] little season a little time Lord that we

[24:50] they are speaking to father bringing
[24:52] back safe just bless each one thank you
[24:55] Lord for the ones that are here today we
[24:57] actually just be with us during this
[24:58] season Lord that we not forget we know
[25:00] that you weren't born on December the
[25:02] 25th but Lord that was the day when you
[25:04] got born again in my heart and you came
[25:06] inside and that was my Christmas Lord

[25:09] inside me called the baptism of the Holy
[25:12] Ghost Father we pray now that you just
[25:13] take care of us lead us and guide us by
[25:15] your Holy Spirit and further min of this
[25:17] service amen
[25:18] and when he had opened the fifth seal
[25:21] bowed Annie's gonna get to think when we
[25:24] read I saw under the altar the souls of
[25:26] them that were slain for the word of God
[25:27] and for the testimony which they held
[25:28] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[25:31] how long O Lord holy and true dost thou
[25:33] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[25:34] that dwell on the earth in white robes
[25:37] were given unto every one of them and it
[25:39] was said unto them that they should rest
[25:41] yet for a little season until their
[25:42] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[25:44] that should be killed as they were
[25:45] should be fulfilled you may be seated
[25:48] the Lord had his blessings reading the
[25:49] word thank you buddy
[25:53] thank you brother
[25:59] thank the Lord for brother Danny ten
[26:04] years ago he couldn't walked up here
[26:06] like that
[26:06] amen that's right but thank God he can
[26:13] do it this is good weekend go hunting
[26:16] everything you know something god I will
[26:19] restore you know you keep that oh you
[26:21] keep patting your heart because he'll
[26:22] restore you he will restore your your
[26:25] thinking and all the things that you
[26:27] need in life he will restore it for you
[26:28] so let's get started here real quick
[26:31] just be patient
[26:34] maybe a little bit a little bit longer
[26:36] today than usual but I got to get to
[26:38] this point so now we're going to review
[26:41] the seals just for a second bring them
[26:44] up on the board that's what we did this
[26:45] Wednesday night but we're gonna do it
[26:47] again we've already been through seal
[26:50] one steel one we started back in
[26:52] February of last year so yeah I am so
[26:54] slow but it's meticulous and if he's
[26:58] it's like it's like we were talking at
[27:02] the post office one day this week they
[27:04] were talking about the kids line and I
[27:08] told you all the other day about the
[27:09] kids line I said well why are you
[27:12] flipping cuz their line you told them
[27:15] the biggest liars ever been told right
[27:19] and you know what we told it Sloan we
[27:22] believe it
[27:23] the whole world believes in Santa Claus
[27:27] right but it's a lie we told them they
[27:31] didn't get it on their own somebody had
[27:35] to tell them so listen if I take maybe
[27:36] if we turn that around and if we tell
[27:38] you the truth long enough you'll believe
[27:40] it it's the truth and there ma'am that
[27:43] it's not a lie that it is the truth amen
[27:46] so now what we were talking about in the
[27:48] seals just for just for a moment we see
[27:52] that the seal that seal had something
[27:56] covered up right membrane says brother
[27:59] Branham showed in the illustration this
[28:01] is the way they used to have a book it
[28:03] wasn't like this it was in a scroll and
[28:07] it had a seal on it had a seal right
[28:09] here and that book was sealed
[28:12] with a seal now you can't read what's
[28:14] inside that with this seal on it so when
[28:19] brother Branham came the Prophet came in
[28:21] God through William Branham toward the
[28:24] seal back this says the wild horse rider
[28:27] is now the Antichrist and then it always
[28:31] what it always was and of course it
[28:32] wasn't it was the Holy Ghost and it
[28:34] turned into Benton oh it always was the
[28:36] Antichrist man had just what went in
[28:41] this direction when the Prophet came he
[28:44] turned us in that direction because when
[28:46] he pulled that seal off the seal showed
[28:48] that this seal was that the what was
[28:52] covered up was sealed by the Antichrist
[28:56] the white horse rider but now underneath
[29:00] there though there was something written
[29:03] that's the Thunder that's what I want to
[29:06] know once that seals broke it's broke
[29:10] Jesus broke him 2,000 years ago
[29:13] preaching them in Matthew 24 we just
[29:16] didn't realize what he was doing to a
[29:18] God sent a prophet hey Ben they're right
[29:21] so it's not something new but what's new
[29:24] is is the Thunder that's underneath that
[29:26] seal and then the Thunder listen
[29:29] underneath that seals what's going to
[29:31] change our body the tunnel is underneath
[29:33] our seals like what brother Joe said
[29:35] it's going to what teach us how to be a
[29:37] better Christian teach us these things
[29:39] that we should have known before but
[29:41] what we've been going in this direction
[29:45] right here and then while horse rider is
[29:49] the Holy Ghost
[29:49] no the wild horse rider is the
[29:51] Antichrist and this is what's covered
[29:53] under that seal you had to turn
[29:55] completely 180 because remember what
[29:58] does repent mean turn around and go
[30:02] another direction not go back in that
[30:07] direction going another direction all
[30:09] right so we got to bring our mindset to
[30:12] this direction to where that we
[30:15] understand obviously folks this is the
[30:18] way God's always wanted us to go
[30:22] but when this I was thinking yesterday
[30:25] you know brother branham talks about the
[30:27] seals he talks about the first seal when
[30:29] they saying went out well see that's how
[30:32] the Santa Claus thing got started a
[30:34] saying went out a saying went to a deed
[30:37] a deed went to a doctrine it was all
[30:42] false the saying was false the deed was
[30:47] false and the doctrine was false father
[30:51] son Holy Ghost said listen folks
[30:52] Mollison hold those baptism though it
[30:54] was accepted by 99% of the world never
[30:57] was right it's always been wrong God has
[31:02] winked at our ignorance for going in
[31:04] that direction because man has kept
[31:06] telling us all of my life I'm gonna take
[31:09] what Jesus said and you ever heard that
[31:12] before
[31:12] I have jesus said baptizing them father
[31:15] son Holy Ghost oh that's what we're
[31:16] gonna do you just can't get them to see
[31:18] that what jesus said and what Peter said
[31:21] is the same identical thing so that's
[31:24] why brother Branham had to come to
[31:26] restore us back to the faith of the
[31:29] fathers restore all the doctrines back
[31:33] restore us all the way back to work the
[31:36] right kind of worship conduct order in
[31:38] doctors in church or everything he
[31:40] turned us back right ain't know what's
[31:44] supposed to turn our heart back turn
[31:48] you've heard that we're turning our
[31:50] heart back in other words we were going
[31:53] in this direction and the Ministry of
[31:55] Elijah turned us
[31:58] amen so now as we were looking at the
[32:03] seal seal number one is the wild horse
[32:06] riders the Antichrist
[32:07] that's all rights a man but underneath
[32:10] that seal we see that there was a white
[32:12] righteous church already working in the
[32:15] first three Church ages is that Alright
[32:17] work can't say man that's better when
[32:23] y'all open Crescent presence day after
[32:25] tomorrow you're gonna be going let us
[32:29] say Amen just a few times if you don't
[32:32] let's practice
[32:34] hey man thank you thank you you can keep
[32:40] saying if you want dude it's all right
[32:41] they gonna bother me like brother Brown
[32:44] said that don't not scare you say hey
[32:47] man I'm not scare you
[32:49] hey man so ceiling up thank you that's
[32:53] enough sale sale number see that good
[33:00] thank you
[33:02] so seal number one is the white horse
[33:05] riders Antichrist right but in the first
[33:08] three Church ages there was a what there
[33:10] was a white righteous church working in
[33:13] the first three Church ages we bring
[33:15] through this everybody ought to say Amen
[33:17] to this cuz we've done been through this
[33:18] since February of last year all right
[33:21] now the second seal when it opened it
[33:24] showed a Red Horse is that correct say
[33:26] man and then we saw the Red Horse being
[33:29] the killing of 68 million Christians the
[33:34] seal was that that saying became a deed
[33:37] that deed became it became a doctrine
[33:39] that doctrine became a person all right
[33:42] in this age right here in the Catholic H
[33:43] all right seal number three is the black
[33:47] horse which the black horse rider was
[33:50] what the man aged the lion ox man and
[33:53] the eagle is that Alright say man
[33:56] all right lying ox man and Eagle that
[34:00] all right all right this age was what
[34:03] this was white red black and pale which
[34:08] is everything mixed together in this
[34:11] fourth age
[34:12] line aged ox man in Eagle Lian Li Owen
[34:15] not lying
[34:16] lion ox man and Eagle we see these first
[34:19] four seals when they break they show us
[34:24] then the plan of redemption
[34:27] not just the anti cross not just no no
[34:31] it reveals Jesus Christ and when that
[34:34] revealed Jesus Christ to the to the
[34:36] prophet of God
[34:37] the Anti Christ had to ride away here
[34:41] stands a lamb tonight with a book in his
[34:43] hand and there goes a while or something
[34:45] had left that prophet what what had left
[34:47] him them old ideas that he had we read
[34:52] this I'm gonna read it again remember he
[34:54] said it changed my thought process why
[34:57] he thought - while horse rider was holy
[34:59] go this direction now the wild horse
[35:03] rider was the Antichrist he had to turn
[35:05] in his own self at the turn and going
[35:09] this direction
[35:10] second sealed third seal fourth seal
[35:12] even in the fifth seal we're gonna read
[35:14] it he said this is against all my
[35:16] thinking he thought them souls under the
[35:21] altar was what the Christian Church that
[35:23] had died what direction is that the
[35:26] wrong one he had to turn and see that it
[35:31] was a totally different group ma'am
[35:32] dead okay so as we type this and we see
[35:36] the Thunder under the seal the Thunder
[35:38] under the seal shows what quiet
[35:41] justification red is always
[35:44] sanctification the statue of a perfect
[35:47] man what cleaning the trash out all
[35:50] right then we see the fourth seal which
[35:52] is a new birth you say what's that got
[35:53] to do with black listen if you're not
[35:55] dead today if you're not dead today you
[35:59] don't have the new birth amen if you're
[36:03] not dead I've said before you can't
[36:07] divorce your old man your old man's got
[36:10] to be dead before you can marry somebody
[36:12] else
[36:13] hey man natural and spiritual so you
[36:17] can't divorce you men hang them up in
[36:18] the closet why so these not dead
[36:22] listen we're bribed we're female we
[36:25] can't have a living husband to living
[36:27] husband right you know I got one
[36:30] what other one's got to be dead so your
[36:33] first time who's got to be dead amen
[36:35] so the new birth seal number three types
[36:37] of new birth or adoption which is we're
[36:40] going up to a higher plane folks we're
[36:42] not down here at the bottom where the
[36:43] babies are a man you stay a baby it's
[36:48] your fault right your fault you stay a
[36:55] baby my fault if I stay a baby but you
[36:59] sit in this church long enough if you're
[37:02] a baby
[37:02] here's your fault that's my Christmas
[37:07] gift to you still number four is what
[37:11] it's all the three seals wrapped
[37:14] together right white black red mixed
[37:20] together makes a pale horse well what
[37:23] does justification sanctification the
[37:25] baptism the Holy Ghost do it makes you
[37:27] the word made flesh but you've got to
[37:31] have all three the three completes the
[37:35] birth remember you can be justified
[37:36] without being Saints five Saints fine
[37:38] without being justified but you can't
[37:40] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[37:42] not be justified in sanctified you can
[37:45] have an anointing that's the whole
[37:47] problem and our message we got a lot of
[37:48] anointings
[37:51] but when you become the Word made flesh
[37:54] Jesus Christ wasn't just anointed he was
[37:58] God now he was anointed for his message
[38:01] if for his ministry for his three and a
[38:03] half years
[38:05] I'm gonna give you a Christmas present
[38:08] maybe you'll remember less when we get
[38:10] into the seventh sale I just thought
[38:11] about this other day I want you to chew
[38:13] on it I give you something to chew on
[38:14] every once in a while that okay now the
[38:18] Seventh Seal when the Seventh Seal
[38:19] breaks their silence in heaven for a
[38:21] half an hour that's thirty minutes right
[38:24] all right that's thirty minutes and who
[38:28] is the Seventh Seal Jesus Christ
[38:31] right he is that seal silence in heaven
[38:35] for thirty minutes or a half an hour how
[38:42] old was he when he went to the river
[38:43] Jordan it was thirty you remember they
[38:48] called that from his birth to 30 of the
[38:50] silent years just think about I'm
[38:55] mulling something around a little bit
[38:57] Lord maybe maybe we'll find out what
[39:00] that half-hour silence is you know what
[39:02] though he wasn't dead he was doing
[39:04] something the world didn't know a thing
[39:07] about it he just pops up at 30 years old
[39:09] starts his message hmm hmm he just pops
[39:13] up in 30 minutes and starts his message
[39:16] okay so I'll let you think about that
[39:18] because we got a long way to go we're
[39:19] still in still number 5 but just think
[39:20] about that that's why they call it the
[39:23] silent years maybe you said well silence
[39:26] in heaven nothing was going on well God
[39:28] wasn't in heaven shut per se he was on
[39:30] the earth during that time hmm unless
[39:35] you think Jesus wasn't God whatever
[39:38] anyway see you number 5 that ain't right
[39:48] that's right amen I probably never
[39:53] preached nothing like that the Lord
[39:55] Jesus didn't either so now when we come
[40:02] to the fourth seal when it opens from
[40:04] brother Brown said the fourth seal opens
[40:06] the rapture takes place under the fourth
[40:10] seal amen the rapture takes place under
[40:15] the fourth seal I'm quoting of what he
[40:16] said so don't look at me cross-eyed like
[40:18] I don't know
[40:19] but I read you the quote the bride goes
[40:23] up after the fourth seal because when
[40:25] the fifth seal opens it opens in a
[40:28] totally another another dimension there
[40:31] are no combat beef there are no line ox
[40:34] man and eagle which is what the holy
[40:36] ghost in the church ages in the
[40:39] believers and then so if you don't see
[40:42] it on the fifth fifth seal then there
[40:44] must be something happen
[40:46] we took a rapture we go up God comes
[40:52] down and starts dealing with Israel so
[40:54] when the fourth seal opens when we get
[40:57] the rebel let me put it that way when we
[40:59] get the revelation of that fourth seal
[41:01] then that's going to hopefully change
[41:04] our body but we must have sealed number
[41:07] five because if you take seal five six
[41:09] and seven and put them well that's just
[41:12] to the Jews well that's okay but it
[41:16] ain't just it's to the Jews but you got
[41:21] to bring seal number five back over just
[41:23] grief there's a handle on the bottom of
[41:27] that somewhere you got to have seal five
[41:29] six and seven because when we go in the
[41:32] rapture it's went to me is when the
[41:35] seventh seal culminates because who
[41:39] takes a rapture you me I thought Christ
[41:43] come back for itself the bride they
[41:46] ain't no two people I'm telling you the
[41:49] more I see it the more I see it there's
[41:52] people in this message or tunas they man
[41:56] they're tunas well Jesus is over yonder
[41:58] doing something and I'm over here
[42:02] 2,000 years ago Paul said it was Christ
[42:05] in you the hope of glory so we can stand
[42:09] on the in the end time and say I and my
[42:12] father are one
[42:14] not I and my father one I'm pointing to
[42:17] my natural father but I am my father or
[42:20] one I came from God and I'm going back
[42:24] to God amen not only excite you
[42:29] that don't stir you so yes
[42:32] bones fill out your bowl anyhow I like
[42:38] what Aaron says so the fifth seal now
[42:41] wants the fifth seal the fifth seal to
[42:43] me and as we see the seal open what is
[42:47] the fifth seal well it's it's the souls
[42:50] under the altar card how long fifth seal
[42:52] Jew but now what's that got to do with
[42:54] me and you there must be a thunder or a
[42:56] revelation underneath that that tells us
[42:59] something about ourselves if not then we
[43:01] just leave five six and seven alone
[43:02] let's go to the house no five six and
[43:06] seven two mirrors of the motive the most
[43:07] important for our body change you heard
[43:11] what I said for our body change because
[43:13] seal 1 2 3 & 4 happens to your soul at
[43:18] the new birth then you turn right back
[43:21] around and start up the statue of a
[43:23] perfect man who put that chair there
[43:25] justification sanctification baptism of
[43:27] the Holy Ghost then what then we start
[43:32] with a headstone these seals have never
[43:37] been broke to anybody but you and me
[43:41] come on brother brown told him on the
[43:45] seat seal he said you're not getting
[43:46] this it's not even for you I read you
[43:51] the quote 20 times so who's it for
[43:56] everybody
[43:58] dude through what we did Wednesday take
[43:59] your finger and go it's for that person
[44:05] you're pointing that I can say it for me
[44:07] I don't know if it's for you a black
[44:09] says for me like brother Dale said
[44:10] that's my Bible I love what brother
[44:13] Brown said he said garden he said God
[44:15] gave me this eye he said God gave me
[44:16] this eye he said now it's mine it's my
[44:19] eye so when God gave me the Holy Ghost
[44:21] it's mine it's not yours it's mine
[44:24] it's not even God's anymore no it's mine
[44:27] you know what he's pleased to dwell in
[44:31] you
[44:32] I hope so now as we go through the seals
[44:35] I don't know there's a glare on that but
[44:38] still we got Church ages
[44:41] once the church agents are over we leave
[44:44] a man who's talking about it downstairs
[44:48] this morning we're that wild olive
[44:51] branch that was grafted in we'll get
[44:54] into that in just a few minutes like I
[44:56] said I may be a little bit longer today
[44:57] but you know what you ain't got nothing
[45:00] else to do this afternoon will stand
[45:01] downstairs for two hours and talk so
[45:03] maybe we'll just do it up here so seal
[45:06] number five then seal number four one
[45:08] two three and four covers the church
[45:10] ages is that Alright say ma'am covers
[45:13] the church ages gets us in a rapture a
[45:15] body change in a rapture and gets us out
[45:18] of here but I'm still number five you
[45:20] gotta laugh it back and put it back in
[45:24] your experience listen this is not
[45:26] church ages this is you this is you you
[45:31] go through justification sanctification
[45:33] baptism the Holy Ghost to be the Word
[45:35] made flesh that's you all those other
[45:38] church ages are already gone their past
[45:41] they passed away their ideas are in the
[45:46] sixth dimension with them and I don't
[45:47] mean ideas what got them there their
[45:49] revelation got them into the sixth
[45:52] dimension and they're waiting on
[45:54] somebody one more time they're waiting
[46:06] on somebody to get this revelation it's
[46:10] always been there it's in the Bible
[46:13] we've been reading scripture after
[46:15] scripture after scripture where did
[46:20] brother Branham get it oh he just pulled
[46:22] it out of the air no he got an alibi
[46:23] ball but he didn't get it like man's
[46:27] tradition said he got it straight from
[46:30] the mind of God and it can't be wrong it
[46:35] cannot be wrong the Prophet preached it
[46:39] right and he preached it right the first
[46:42] time
[46:42] he ain't got to come back and preach it
[46:44] again hey ma'am is that the old me or an
[46:48] amen amen
[46:49] okay so now the fifth seal
[46:54] we must see now the fifth seal God is
[46:58] going to give eternal life to a group of
[47:01] people it doesn't want it didn't want it
[47:08] didn't know anything about God or Jesus
[47:10] Christ all they knew about was Jehovah
[47:12] and they worried you write that okay you
[47:17] didn't carry anything about Jesus Christ
[47:19] when you as a sinner so he give eternal
[47:23] life to you the same way the only the
[47:28] only difference is is we accepted it and
[47:31] we got it here the fifth seal Jew
[47:33] they're gonna get it because of
[47:35] something God did he blinded their eyes
[47:39] so that we could come in so the fifth
[47:43] seal then is going to cover we talked
[47:45] about last Wednesday listen it says
[47:49] souls under the altar now look this is
[47:54] not the altar that God is talking about
[47:58] when brother Brennan went across the
[48:00] curtain of time he didn't walk up to an
[48:02] altar
[48:05] the Bible has always wanted the altar to
[48:09] be where take your finger and go like
[48:12] that again right here's where the altar
[48:14] God didn't walk he didn't want brick and
[48:17] mortar and wood he wants right here
[48:21] listen that's what he came for he didn't
[48:23] come to build a building he didn't come
[48:26] to build a wooden Ark he didn't come to
[48:27] build a brick Ark or or a metal arc he
[48:31] came to build a heart with flesh flesh
[48:36] heart what is saying is Eko he said a
[48:39] new heart well I give you I'll take your
[48:42] stony heart and give you a pliable flesh
[48:47] heart so that I can deal with you
[48:49] because you know what if your heart God
[48:50] can't deal with you but if you got a
[48:52] little bit of God can deal with you
[48:57] thank God our hearts are not made out of
[48:59] stone it wouldn't work but God comes
[49:03] down to the altar so what were we
[49:05] talking about last Wednesday the altered
[49:07] is not and I had that big old word and
[49:10] I'm not gonna pronounce it again but the
[49:12] altar is not the altar what an altar is
[49:16] is that you are in a position and you're
[49:19] looking to Calvary for what Christ did
[49:22] for you and you're in a place knowing
[49:26] that God died for you at Calvary and
[49:29] that's under the altar so you're under
[49:31] what somebody that made an atonement or
[49:35] a perpetuation for you they're above you
[49:37] and they've made that atonement and
[49:40] that's the altar
[49:42] remember when brother Brandon went
[49:43] across the curtain of time he said I
[49:45] want to see Jesus the angel said he's a
[49:48] little higher what he was in another
[49:51] dimension he was in the seventh
[49:52] dimension where he had a glorified body
[49:56] is that okay but they were also
[49:59] remembered the sixth dimension when
[50:02] brother Brown went across the angel said
[50:04] these are souls under the altar now
[50:06] brother Branham put the two together and
[50:07] thought it was the fifth seal fifth seal
[50:11] sold on the altar cry how long how long
[50:15] ducks that was this way that was not the
[50:21] souls under the altar that he saw in the
[50:23] sixth dimension hey man
[50:25] they'll go to sleep on me German
[50:28] chocolate cake I'm fixing to get
[50:29] something my birthday's in a few months
[50:32] Thank You Aaron but this way that fifth
[50:37] seal Jew is not even close to what he
[50:40] thought didn't line up with what he had
[50:46] but when God turned him and he thought
[50:48] oh my listen let's go to number two the
[50:54] fifth seal
[50:54] you stole back now I get on them
[50:56] subjects we just talk on and on and on
[50:58] the people around the walls standing
[51:00] halls rooms and so forth we came to get
[51:03] a church falling maple stand around the
[51:05] walls Auriemma freezing so I'll get
[51:07] right straight to the message now I want
[51:09] to give thanks to him along the present
[51:10] and that today not knowing one thing
[51:13] about that fifth seal it came in that
[51:15] same mysterious way this morning a man
[51:18] just about an hour before now keep going
[51:21] number three
[51:25] number three please now notice in the
[51:27] ninth verse souls under the altar now
[51:29] here's where I'm gonna get some real
[51:31] disagreement why because of what he
[51:34] thought of his life all theologians
[51:38] thought that was two souls under the
[51:40] altar of the of the dead that was in
[51:42] Christ all right I thought that - I
[51:49] thought that - my thought process was
[51:52] that was the souls of the of the early
[51:56] church but it didn't come that way I've
[52:00] always thought that these souls under
[52:02] the altar with the martyrs of the early
[52:04] church and I'm sure that dr. your eyes
[52:06] Smith and every one of them says it is
[52:07] but I thought so myself but when the
[52:12] Holy Spirit shows the vision to it it
[52:14] wasn't it isn't the souls
[52:15] what brother Brown thought he thought it
[52:17] was the souls of these people that have
[52:19] been through the church ages right that
[52:22] that was the souls under the altar that
[52:24] were souls under the altar they're not
[52:26] crying how long do avenge our blood
[52:27] though two different totally different
[52:29] people
[52:30] because look the fifth seal Jew is not
[52:33] even under this church ages they're over
[52:38] here they're a special group of people
[52:41] right here - fifth seal Jew they're not
[52:47] over here in the church ages brother
[52:49] Brown said that I thought the same thing
[52:51] [Music]
[52:52] we said now you say well I don't know
[52:57] about that well now wait just a minute
[52:58] these are not the souls of the bride
[53:01] Church now what's the bride church the
[53:03] bride comes from seven church ages and
[53:06] then not the bride church not at all we
[53:09] thought that was the bride church
[53:13] waiting their souls under the altar
[53:15] crying how long how long let me read it
[53:17] again so he reads it and I keep going up
[53:18] see the Word of God testimony which they
[53:21] held and I don't move from there just a
[53:22] minute how long how long Lord how long
[53:24] wholly intrude us now judge and avenge
[53:26] our blood on them that dwell on the
[53:28] earth and he reads the rest of the
[53:29] scripture and they go to the bottom now
[53:31] for they at this time if you notice this
[53:33] fifth seal being open the church is gone
[53:37] so there are no souls under the altar of
[53:40] the early church amen
[53:43] hello I'm just waking them up in the
[53:47] back all right well I mean you know what
[53:53] they leave the through your soul where
[53:55] it won't one of the thing it just can't
[54:00] be the souls on an early church why look
[54:02] because all these have been caught up we
[54:04] are actually in another dimension up
[54:07] here at the wedding supper out of the
[54:12] way of any of this we're over in another
[54:16] dimension
[54:17] enjoying the wedding supper while this
[54:20] is going on now watch he just can't be
[54:25] the soldier under the other church now
[54:26] please if you ever did give this
[54:27] attention now because this is a great
[54:30] controversy so I want you to listen real
[54:32] close now you got pen and paper write it
[54:34] down and I want you to notice these
[54:36] cannot be them Souls because the souls
[54:38] of the righteous martyred the righteous
[54:40] people the church the bride has done
[54:42] been took up so they wouldn't be under
[54:44] the altar they'd be in glory with the
[54:47] bride now watch for they are gone in two
[54:48] wraps on the fourth chapter of
[54:50] revelations they are taken up all right
[54:53] so now let's go to the next part we want
[54:55] to talk about just for a second then
[54:57] then we know for one thing's for sure
[54:59] the first four seals the the Thunder
[55:02] underneath those seals happens right
[55:04] here in this dimension amen happens in
[55:10] this dimension right here but now the
[55:13] fifth seal can't happen in this
[55:15] dimension John had to look into another
[55:18] dimension to see those souls under the
[55:20] altar put into place I don't know where
[55:22] you want to put them but they're
[55:24] actually in a place they're theophanies
[55:27] are in a place and that the Alpha knees
[55:30] are so alive till they are talking to
[55:33] John talking to John and they must have
[55:39] their memory because they're going how
[55:41] long how long to avenge our blood they
[55:44] knew how they were killed sister Jeanne
[55:45] in this dimension they knew that carried
[55:47] right over into that dimension wherever
[55:49] there
[55:51] right will read it in just a minute but
[55:55] now brother Branham will let me skip
[55:57] through this real quick brother branham
[55:59] I always thought that he could talk to
[56:01] brother Neville but not shake his hand
[56:03] we read the quote last Sunday that they
[56:05] were just wait a minute what sitting on
[56:07] a cloud playing a harp we'd be in
[56:09] trouble because I can't even play
[56:11] through spoons but don't look at me all
[56:16] you candidates can play anything look at
[56:19] me like that
[56:20] hey wait a minute what will we talk
[56:22] we're gonna sit on a cloud and we're
[56:25] gonna play a harp
[56:30] now we real people touch see hear them
[56:38] talk to them hug them they're real
[56:43] they're more real than you are that's
[56:47] our whole thinking we tell all they've
[56:49] they've died and went on and you're
[56:51] going they died one oh well please
[56:55] they're brand-new
[56:57] and you're still sitting here and you're
[56:58] dead old stinking body so who's got the
[57:01] problem
[57:03] that's our thinking thinking poor thing
[57:09] not what you know what they're over
[57:11] there six dimension they're going poor
[57:13] thing poor thing what brother branham
[57:16] didn't want to come back I got it right
[57:18] here
[57:18] he said do I have to go back down there
[57:20] and getting that thing they're more
[57:29] alive than we are folks they're eternal
[57:32] as the God Almighty is eternal there is
[57:34] eternal and right now you are not fully
[57:37] eternal I'll promise you I see a lot of
[57:39] gray hair even brother Daniel getting a
[57:43] little bit of gray hair unless he hides
[57:47] it
[57:49] but now when brother Brown goes across
[57:51] the curtain of time I don't pull these
[57:52] quotes up brother Brown says he when he
[57:54] went to heaven he said there's no
[57:55] explaining it he said I could touch them
[57:57] people I could feel them I could see
[58:01] them they talked to me I talked to them
[58:03] they weren't up here playing harps you
[58:05] know I'm floating buying and you know
[58:07] hold your hand up old you know
[58:08] you know this is what he thought well
[58:10] don't even touch me this is what he
[58:11] thought I can't shake their hand
[58:14] NoHo they grabbed him and probably
[58:16] squeeze the breath out of him my
[58:19] precious brother and he says right here
[58:25] well I cut it out of this which you know
[58:28] what he said he said they were all
[58:29] hugging me millions of them he said all
[58:31] those nights of oh woe is me while he
[58:35] was he wouid in other words like brother
[58:37] jewel says he said all them went away
[58:39] when I saw them when that angel turned
[58:42] and said you see that woman right there
[58:44] she was 90 years old when she received
[58:49] Christ in your meeting and he said no
[58:51] wonder she said my precious brother oh
[58:54] well there's no way could recognize her
[58:57] the last time he saw her that's what
[58:59] gets me the last time we saw Robert
[59:00] Tatum we'll never see that again yeah
[59:03] anybody you want to see Richard they're
[59:07] young Jesus they're so full of Oh
[59:11] eternal life and we go that's alright
[59:19] though we're getting this thing changed
[59:21] we're heading in the right direction I
[59:22] believe we've turned you know I think
[59:26] another day brother Brad said only the
[59:29] Prophet can turn a corner anyone can
[59:32] build a wall and man anybody can build a
[59:35] wall but when you come to a place to
[59:38] have to turn you have to have a prophet
[59:41] on the same people the Prophet never
[59:44] left us no he's here the Prophet is
[59:55] right here so we have to look in the
[59:57] spirit realm look at these theophanies
[59:59] in the fifth dimension cuz that is the
[1:00:01] fifth seal Jude there by all right with
[1:00:03] that say man all right so now let's go
[1:00:05] to the seal let's read the seal again
[1:00:09] this is where brother Branham when we
[1:00:11] read to seal go to the next one please
[1:00:13] and when he had opened the fifth seal I
[1:00:15] saw under the altar the souls of them
[1:00:16] that were slain for the word of God and
[1:00:19] for the testimony which they held and
[1:00:21] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[1:00:22] long O Lord they're talking how long O
[1:00:25] Lord holy and true dost thou not judge
[1:00:27] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[1:00:28] on the earth and white robes were given
[1:00:30] under every one of them and it was said
[1:00:32] unto them that they should rest yet for
[1:00:34] a while or a little season until their
[1:00:37] fellow-servants also and their brother
[1:00:38] should be killed as they were should be
[1:00:40] fulfilled all right so that can't be
[1:00:43] anything to do with a born-again
[1:00:45] Christian because number one you're not
[1:00:48] gonna say how long do avenge our blood
[1:00:50] you're gonna say God forgive them amen
[1:00:54] but who are these souls under the altar
[1:00:56] we know who they are they're the fifth
[1:00:58] sealed you people that were killed under
[1:01:00] Eichmann and Hitler and during the time
[1:01:02] of the Gentile dispensation then all
[1:01:04] right okay and the Word of God they held
[1:01:08] now it wasn't we look in another
[1:01:10] scripture and we may try to find it but
[1:01:12] you can read it yourself
[1:01:13] the Bible says the testimony of Jesus
[1:01:16] Christ they didn't have the testimony of
[1:01:18] Jesus Christ they had two testimony
[1:01:20] which they held which was what where
[1:01:22] it's you were God's people plain and
[1:01:25] simple
[1:01:25] where'd you were God's people and we're
[1:01:27] under the promises of God to the Jews
[1:01:31] that's all they got and then judge and
[1:01:36] avenge our blood and we know for one
[1:01:38] thing's for sure they must have went
[1:01:40] across the curtain of time with a little
[1:01:41] temperance they didn't get rid of theirs
[1:01:44] on this side to judge and avenge our
[1:01:47] blood what they could remember what
[1:01:48] happens what happened was they got
[1:01:50] killed just because they were Jews
[1:01:52] plain and simple just because they were
[1:01:54] Jesus how it's why they got killed
[1:01:56] there's no other reason there's not and
[1:02:00] white robes were given to them wherever
[1:02:04] they are and they're supposed to rest
[1:02:06] for a little season until their
[1:02:08] fellow-servants and brethren are killed
[1:02:10] in other words the ones that are going
[1:02:11] on because remember like we said
[1:02:13] Wednesday
[1:02:14] John had this vision of Patmos vision
[1:02:17] about right here right
[1:02:20] so they weren't actually killed yet it
[1:02:24] was a prophecy because that they were
[1:02:27] killed most of them the biggest portion
[1:02:29] were killed right here Eichmann and
[1:02:30] Hitler were killed they all got killed
[1:02:32] right here I don't say all but I say a
[1:02:34] big portion of them did 6 million of
[1:02:35] them did but Paul's I mean joins on the
[1:02:39] Isle of Patmos and those souls are under
[1:02:41] that altar telling him what's going to
[1:02:43] happen right and then they gotta wait
[1:02:48] for their fellow servants now who are
[1:02:50] their fellow servants and their brethren
[1:02:53] Jews we're not their fellow service
[1:02:55] we're not their brethren we're Gentiles
[1:02:58] we're dogs remember but you gotta wait
[1:03:01] till they're killed like they were
[1:03:05] should be fulfilled so that like brother
[1:03:08] Dale said now there's your example their
[1:03:10] scripture in the Bible and it has not
[1:03:13] been fulfilled yet not all of it okay
[1:03:17] it's been written on a piece of paper
[1:03:19] but in actuality it has not come to pass
[1:03:22] yet amen so it's got to though because
[1:03:25] it's in the Bible God saw it already
[1:03:27] happened so it's got to be fulfilled
[1:03:28] alright so now let's go to the
[1:03:30] transgression we're gonna I apologize
[1:03:34] for some of the words that I got to use
[1:03:36] but I'm just reading the Bible okay that
[1:03:38] all right so pay attention because
[1:03:40] remember
[1:03:43] God was married to Israel Israel was his
[1:03:47] first bride hey man
[1:03:50] Israel was his first bride well if you
[1:03:55] don't believe it I'm fixing to read it
[1:03:56] to you the Lord said unto me in the days
[1:03:59] of Josiah the king just saw you don't
[1:04:01] know you just king did you well I guess
[1:04:02] you did you're 18 you think he delivered
[1:04:04] that's now saying that which backsliding
[1:04:06] Israel have done
[1:04:07] she has gone up upon every high mountain
[1:04:10] and under every Green Tree
[1:04:11] maybe it'll wake you up a little bit
[1:04:13] there have played the harlot and I said
[1:04:16] after she had done all these things
[1:04:17] turned down to me but she returned not
[1:04:20] and her treacherous sister Judah saw it
[1:04:22] now remember Wednesday night Israel and
[1:04:25] Judas split their Kingdom for a little
[1:04:28] while they had a little feud between
[1:04:29] each other and they they split the
[1:04:31] kingdom but God didn't split them God
[1:04:33] said you both the same all right and I
[1:04:37] saw and went for all the causes whereby
[1:04:39] backsliding Israel committed adultery I
[1:04:43] had put her away and giving her a bill
[1:04:46] of divorcement see now look he can't she
[1:04:51] can't remember marriage and divorce he
[1:04:54] can't she can't woman commits adultery
[1:04:56] against you you can put her away give
[1:04:58] her a bill of divorcement and marry
[1:05:00] again
[1:05:01] but you women can't do that according to
[1:05:04] according to marriage and divorce you
[1:05:06] can't do that you can't give your
[1:05:08] husband a billing of divorcement and go
[1:05:10] marry again your husband's got to be
[1:05:11] diedie dead all right so I said about
[1:05:16] being born again if your husband was not
[1:05:18] dead you can't married again if your
[1:05:19] husband's dead you're free to marry the
[1:05:21] man put her away giving her a bill of
[1:05:25] divorcement yet her treacherous sister
[1:05:26] Judah fear not but went and played the
[1:05:28] harlot also so they're both in the same
[1:05:30] bed together no pun intended and it came
[1:05:33] to pass through the lightness of her
[1:05:34] whoredom that she defiled the land keep
[1:05:38] that in mind that's gonna cover that in
[1:05:40] just a little while defiled the land and
[1:05:43] committed adultery with stones and with
[1:05:45] stalks in other words they built her own
[1:05:46] sacrifice altar and yet for all this her
[1:05:49] treacherous sisters you two have not
[1:05:50] turned unto me with her whole heart but
[1:05:53] faintly saith the Lord and the Lord sent
[1:05:55] unto me talking
[1:05:57] Germa the backsliding Israel have
[1:05:59] justified herself that doesn't that
[1:06:02] sound like a Jew it ain't my fault all
[1:06:06] right
[1:06:07] the backsliding Israel had justified
[1:06:10] herself more than treacherous Judah go
[1:06:13] and proclaim these words toward the
[1:06:14] north and say return thou backsliding
[1:06:16] Israel in other words he divorced her
[1:06:18] but he didn't kill her he put her away
[1:06:22] she's still alive she's still alive but
[1:06:27] she'll never be her hurt and she'll
[1:06:31] never be his wife again cuz once you get
[1:06:34] a divorce you're not supposed to marry
[1:06:36] your wife again if she goes and commits
[1:06:38] adultery with somebody else
[1:06:39] the lands been polluted that's what the
[1:06:41] Bible says okay pretty plain and I will
[1:06:44] not cause my anger to fall upon you in
[1:06:46] other words return backsliding Israel
[1:06:48] come by look at the grace God's God I
[1:06:51] told brother Daniel I told him I said
[1:06:54] man there's no way man could come up
[1:06:56] with the word grief we have no grace for
[1:06:59] nobody because that's what you've done
[1:07:02] to me and I remember what you did to me
[1:07:04] and you did to that one and I did to
[1:07:05] this one and this happened to you and
[1:07:06] you didn't look at me right and a car
[1:07:08] didn't shake my hand this morning and
[1:07:10] you didn't shake my hand this morning do
[1:07:12] you say what I mean I mean now into her
[1:07:16] mind she's going well it was his fault
[1:07:21] see there's no greater than that but
[1:07:25] remember that's but grace is unmerited
[1:07:27] favor it's not one mark of anything you
[1:07:30] did to get grace not one if there was
[1:07:32] one you got to go over here put it under
[1:07:34] a column called works right because
[1:07:38] there's something you did to merit it
[1:07:42] grace is unmerited favor nothing you did
[1:07:46] now what you do afterwards there's works
[1:07:50] what you do afterwards James is right
[1:07:52] show me your faith by your works and
[1:07:58] then works his faith Express brother
[1:08:00] Brown had to preach that he had to
[1:08:02] correct get all that correct because
[1:08:04] everybody's saying what works works
[1:08:05] works works worse no it ain't works but
[1:08:09] now it is works after you get
[1:08:11] again it's what you do going up that
[1:08:14] statue of a perfect man is your works
[1:08:18] but it's not but it's not to determine
[1:08:21] whether you're born again or not no no
[1:08:24] you get born again before you even start
[1:08:26] up the statue of a perfect man a man
[1:08:28] only acknowledged on iniquity say you
[1:08:33] did it
[1:08:34] repent that thou has transgressed
[1:08:37] transgressed against the LORD thy God
[1:08:39] and has scattered the ways to the
[1:08:41] stranger under every Green Tree and you
[1:08:43] have not obeyed my voice saith the Lord
[1:08:46] turn old backsliding children saith the
[1:08:48] Lord for I am married unto you and I
[1:08:51] will take you one of a city until the
[1:08:53] family and I will bring you to Zion
[1:08:56] let's go to Ezekiel now this is going to
[1:08:58] be a little bit long reading but it's
[1:09:01] only 25 after we good
[1:09:08] now when I pass by the and looked upon
[1:09:11] thee behold now this is this is gone
[1:09:14] through Ezekiel this is let me let me

[1:09:29] watch watch what he did now when I pass
[1:09:33] by the and looked upon thee behold that
[1:09:35] time was the time of love and I spread
[1:09:39] my skirt over thee and covered thy
[1:09:42] nakedness yeah I swear unto thee and
[1:09:44] entered into a covenant with thee saith
[1:09:46] the Lord and thou became his mind oh how
[1:09:51] beautiful
[1:09:51] amen for a moment then washed ivy with
[1:09:58] water yeah I washed away thy blood in
[1:10:03] other words I sanctified you and I nor
[1:10:06] did you with oil
[1:10:09] I clothed the also with bra dude works
[1:10:13] he didn't spare no expense shoddy wood
[1:10:17] badger skin and I girded the about with
[1:10:20] fine linen and I covered thee with silk
[1:10:23] he didn't give him a feed sack to put on
[1:10:26] right he loved these people loved him I
[1:10:32] date thee with ornaments and I put
[1:10:34] bracelets upon your hand and chain on

[1:11:41] you that are younger there sitting in
[1:11:43] here that's not this is all an allegory
[1:11:46] I mean all the children the Bears will
[1:11:49] didn't become prostitutes physically but
[1:11:53] when you when you are married to Jehovah
[1:11:56] and then you come over here and you say
[1:11:59] well I'm gonna sacrifice to this God
[1:12:02] you've committed fornication and you've
[1:12:05] become what unclean you've become an
[1:12:07] adulterer because you have two husband
[1:12:09] or you have two people that you're
[1:12:11] claiming to be God thereby okay that did
[1:12:13] they explain enough for everybody
[1:12:14] so it's not that they while all them
[1:12:17] women know if men we're all included a
[1:12:21] man
[1:12:22] and of the garments now just taking deck
[1:12:24] it's not high place with many colors and
[1:12:25] place the harlot thereupon in other
[1:12:28] words what did they do they took
[1:12:29] everything God gave them all the gold
[1:12:31] all the silver all the things that they
[1:12:32] had and they turned them right over here
[1:12:34] and started sacrificing to Moloch and
[1:12:36] debayle and right they took what he gave
[1:12:40] them and did that that makes it worse if
[1:12:47] he can be worse the the light things
[1:12:49] shall not come neither shall it be so
[1:12:50] now that's also taking the fair's fair
[1:12:53] jewels of my gold my silver and which
[1:12:58] I've given the invaders to these images
[1:13:00] of men and did us commit whoredom with
[1:13:03] them not a natural man a God and took a
[1:13:09] style broader garments and cover us them
[1:13:11] and thou have set my oil and my incense
[1:13:14] before them my meat also which I give
[1:13:17] the fine flour and oil and honey
[1:13:19] wherewith I fed thee thou hast even said
[1:13:21] it before them for a sweet savour that
[1:13:24] was supposed to be for his wife and
[1:13:27] she's giving it to another man saith the
[1:13:31] LORD moreover thou has taken thy sons
[1:13:33] and thy daughters whom thou has borne
[1:13:34] unto me and these has to have sacrificed
[1:13:37] unto them to be devoured is this of thy
[1:13:40] whoredoms a small matter that they'll
[1:13:42] have slain my children and delivered
[1:13:45] them to cause them to pass through the
[1:13:46] fire and in all thine abominations and
[1:13:49] all thy whoredoms thou has not
[1:13:51] remembered the days of thy youth when
[1:13:54] thou was naked and barren was polluted
[1:13:56] in thy blood memory back up in the first
[1:13:58] when he found her and it came to pass
[1:14:00] after all that wickedness woe woe unto
[1:14:03] thee saith the Lord God the talents also
[1:14:05] built under the in imminent place and
[1:14:07] has made the in high place in every
[1:14:08] street in other words built altar
[1:14:10] thou has built the high place at every
[1:14:12] head of the way and has made thy beauty
[1:14:14] to be abhorred it has opened thy feet
[1:14:16] and we understand as adults we know what
[1:14:18] it is to everyone that passed by and
[1:14:20] multiplies the them now let's also
[1:14:23] committed fornication with the Egyptians
[1:14:25] their neighbors great of flesh and
[1:14:26] that's the increased on whoredoms to
[1:14:28] provoke me to anger behold therefore I
[1:14:31] have stretched out my hand over thee
[1:14:34] and have diminished our ordinary food
[1:14:35] and deliberately unto the will of them
[1:14:38] that hate thee he's giving him over to
[1:14:42] people they didn't hate him thou has
[1:14:46] played the whole also with the Assyrians
[1:14:47] because that was insatiable yet thou has
[1:14:50] played the harlot with them and you
[1:14:51] could have not be satisfied
[1:14:53] now that's moreover multiplied by
[1:14:55] fornication in the land of Canaan and
[1:14:57] the child dia and yet thou was not
[1:14:59] satisfied in other words they not
[1:15:00] satisfied with any of that how weak is
[1:15:02] thine heart staff the Lord God seeing
[1:15:05] thou doest all these things the work of
[1:15:07] an imperious woman you would
[1:15:11] think if grapes didn't take over he
[1:15:14] would have killed her right if grace
[1:15:17] didn't take over he would have killed
[1:15:19] her
[1:15:19] in that thou built this non imminent
[1:15:22] place in the head of every way and make
[1:15:24] us the high place in every street and
[1:15:26] have not been as a harlot and has not
[1:15:29] been as an harlot as now scorn is higher
[1:15:31] but as a wife that committeth adultery
[1:15:33] which taking strangers instead of her
[1:15:36] husband they give gifts to all
[1:15:38] but thou give us our gift to all the
[1:15:40] lovers and hire us them that they may
[1:15:42] come into the oh never side for that
[1:15:43] them is that enough he's put her
[1:15:48] away thus saith the Lord God because dye
[1:15:51] filthiness was poured out in thy
[1:15:53] nakedness discovered through thy
[1:15:54] whoredoms with all thy lovers with all
[1:15:56] the idols of thy abominations and by the
[1:15:58] blood of thy children which they'll just
[1:16:00] give unto them behold therefore I will
[1:16:02] gather all the lovers with whom thou has
[1:16:05] taken pleasure and all them thou have
[1:16:06] loved and with all that thou has hated
[1:16:09] and I will even gather them round about
[1:16:10] against Eve what are they now they're
[1:16:12] compassed about Jerusalem what everybody
[1:16:17] that Israel played the harlot with at
[1:16:18] this moment today present hate them
[1:16:22] Egypt Syria demand
[1:16:25] I ran Iraq they want Israel to be just
[1:16:28] done away with they want them to if they
[1:16:29] disappeared right now they would not be
[1:16:32] crying in the Middle East well that's
[1:16:35] what it is right there
[1:16:35] God has gathered all the ones that she
[1:16:39] had pleasure with with whom thou has
[1:16:42] taken pleasure in all them to has loved
[1:16:44] with all that was hated I will even
[1:16:46] gather them
[1:16:47] roundabouts against thee and will
[1:16:49] discover thy nakedness under them that
[1:16:51] they may see all thy nakedness and I
[1:16:52] will judge thee as women that break
[1:16:55] wedlock and shed blood are judged and I
[1:16:58] will give thee blood in fury and in
[1:17:01] jealousy that's pretty that's kind of
[1:17:04] far fetched to come back from don't you
[1:17:05] think but thank God for God's grace and
[1:17:12] mercy Book of Isaiah 49 verse 14 but
[1:17:15] Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me and
[1:17:17] my Lord has forgotten me can a woman
[1:17:20] forget her sucking child that she should
[1:17:23] not have compassion on the son of her
[1:17:25] womb yay they may forget yet I will not
[1:17:28] forget them they may forget yet I will
[1:17:34] not forget thee behold I have graven the
[1:17:37] upon the palms of my hand
[1:17:39] the walls are continually before me amen
[1:17:45] you know I was graven in the palm of his
[1:17:46] hand too and the Romans put a nail
[1:17:50] through it that's okay
[1:17:53] my name is still there hey man my name
[1:17:55] is still there your name still there
[1:17:57] zekiel eighteen therefore I will judge
[1:17:59] the old house of Israel everyone
[1:18:01] according to his way to set the Lord
[1:18:03] repent and turn yourself from all your
[1:18:05] transgressions so iniquity shall not be
[1:18:07] your ruin cast away from you all your
[1:18:10] transgressions whereby you have
[1:18:11] transgressed it looks like he's trying
[1:18:13] to what bring Israel by companies and
[1:18:15] make you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:18:17] for thou they will for why will ye die o
[1:18:23] house of Israel for I have no pleasure
[1:18:25] in the death of him that died saith the
[1:18:27] Lord God
[1:18:28] wherefore turn yourself
[1:18:33] and live Ezekiel 36 therefore saying to
[1:18:41] the house of Israel thus saith the Lord
[1:18:43] God now this is the Lord speaking I do
[1:18:45] not this for your sake o house of Israel
[1:18:48] but for mine holy namesake which you
[1:18:51] have profaned among the heathen whether
[1:18:53] you win and I will sanctify my great
[1:18:56] name which was profaned among the
[1:18:58] heathen which you have profaned in the
[1:19:00] midst of them and the heathen shall know
[1:19:02] that I am the Lord saith the Lord God
[1:19:04] when I shall be sanctified in you before
[1:19:08] their eyes for I will take you from
[1:19:11] among the heathen and gather you
[1:19:13] remember he dispersed them remember he
[1:19:17] dispersed Israel he dispersed them
[1:19:19] several times actually and but he's but
[1:19:22] what what happened in the 40s there 49
[1:19:25] 50 where brother Branham saw the the
[1:19:27] movie where they come in on the wings of
[1:19:30] an eagle well from that time till now
[1:19:32] that what they keep coming back because
[1:19:33] the land is theirs for I shall be thanks
[1:19:39] finding you for that for I will take you
[1:19:41] from among the heathen and gather you
[1:19:42] out of all the countries and will bring
[1:19:44] you into your own land then will I
[1:19:47] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[1:19:49] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[1:19:51] them from you all your idols will I
[1:19:53] cleanse you a new heart also will I give
[1:19:56] you in a new spirit will i put within
[1:19:58] you now this is this is us but these
[1:20:00] talking to Israel they're gonna receive
[1:20:04] the holy go listen let's just be real
[1:20:07] real clear these people that get white
[1:20:09] robes they get some kind of cleaning
[1:20:12] God's not gonna put his spirit in
[1:20:16] something that's not right he's got to
[1:20:19] make them right even the fifth seal Jews
[1:20:22] that that white robe what is our white
[1:20:24] robe somebody say what is our white robe
[1:20:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:29] so if white robes were given unto them
[1:20:31] it's just that we get it on this side
[1:20:34] it's called salvation
[1:20:38] there's this called grace a new heart
[1:20:41] will I give you a new spirit what I put
[1:20:43] in you and I will take away the stony
[1:20:44] heart out of your flesh and I will give
[1:20:46] you a heart of flesh and I will put my
[1:20:48] spirit within you and cause you to walk
[1:20:50] in my statutes and you shall keep my
[1:20:52] judgments and do them and you said dwell
[1:20:54] in the land see their promised land
[1:20:59] Abraham wherever the soles of your feet
[1:21:02] walk that is your property that's your
[1:21:05] land and you should dwell in the land
[1:21:07] that I give to your father's why do you
[1:21:09] think the Millennium the Millennium is
[1:21:11] not going to be in Luther Georgia the
[1:21:15] Millennium is going to be in Israel in
[1:21:18] Jerusalem because that's their land I
[1:21:22] still think it's just an absolute apex
[1:21:26] of a revelation for a prophet to walk up
[1:21:29] to a platform one day and say Abraham
[1:21:34] when he took communion with Melchizedek
[1:21:38] out there on the plains of Mamre he said
[1:21:41] he was looking for a city that whose
[1:21:43] builder and maker was God he said that
[1:21:46] city will rise from the same spot that
[1:21:50] Abraham took communion with Melchizedek
[1:21:53] sister Jeanne he was looking for a city
[1:21:56] and he was standing can we be the same
[1:21:59] way we're looking for something we're
[1:22:02] already standing on it can we are we
[1:22:08] doing this are we doing that because you
[1:22:12] know what if you would have told Abraham
[1:22:13] at that time Abraham you're standing on
[1:22:16] the city he'd go what are you talking
[1:22:18] about but now he just might know where
[1:22:22] that cities that being in that dimension
[1:22:24] where he's at he might be going man I'm
[1:22:26] standing on top of that thing all the
[1:22:28] time
[1:22:28] that's the city he was looking for he
[1:22:31] went looking for a city brick mortar
[1:22:32] knowest not what he was looking for that
[1:22:34] what brother Brown said that
[1:22:35] pyramid-shaped mountains gonna push
[1:22:36] right up out of the ground Oh hallelujah
[1:22:41] thank God for a prophet that could do
[1:22:43] that and you should dwell in the land
[1:22:46] that I give to your fathers and you
[1:22:47] shall be my people and I will be your
[1:22:48] God I will also save you from all your
[1:22:51] and cleanness now God's telling them
[1:22:53] this and I will call for the corn and
[1:22:55] will increase and lay no famine upon you
[1:22:59] looks like he's doing something for them
[1:23:01] huh right Jeremiah 31 32 says behold the
[1:23:07] days come saith the Lord that I will
[1:23:10] make a new covenant with the house of
[1:23:12] Israel and with the house of Judah not
[1:23:15] according to the Covenant that I made
[1:23:17] with their fathers back over here in the
[1:23:19] days that I took them by the hand to
[1:23:21] bring them out of the land of Egypt I
[1:23:22] broke that covenant they broke that one
[1:23:26] God don't deal with broke covenants hey
[1:23:29] man we'll see that in just a minute
[1:23:32] nor the coordinates coming they're made
[1:23:34] with the followers in the day that I
[1:23:35] took them as lavalla hand and brought
[1:23:36] him out of the land of Egypt which my
[1:23:38] covenant they break although I was a
[1:23:41] husband unto them saith the Lord now we
[1:23:47] should never have to cover this again
[1:23:48] God was mad Joel was married to Israel
[1:23:50] at one time okay and he had to give her
[1:23:53] a writing of divorcement to get me and
[1:23:56] you right but this shall be the covenant
[1:23:58] that i will make with the house of
[1:24:00] israel after those days saith the lord
[1:24:02] look look at me after those days after
[1:24:07] those 2000 years I got put the Gentiles
[1:24:09] in here I will put my law in your inward
[1:24:12] part and I will write it in your heart
[1:24:15] and I will be their God and they shall
[1:24:16] be my people and they shall teach no
[1:24:19] more every man his neighbor and every
[1:24:20] man his brother saying know the Lord for
[1:24:22] they shall all know me from the least
[1:24:26] and to the greatest of them saith the
[1:24:28] Lord for I will forgive their iniquity
[1:24:30] and I will remember their sin no more
[1:24:37] man it looked bad at one time didn't it
[1:24:40] and brother Elias written in the word
[1:24:43] they didn't look bad but it's also
[1:24:46] written in the word that you look bad
[1:24:47] right we can say due particular but what
[1:24:54] did he do he wiped all that out he wiped
[1:24:58] all of it clean through what
[1:24:59] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:25:01] of Holy Ghost he wiped you clean if
[1:25:04] you're not cleaned today you don't have
[1:25:05] the new birth
[1:25:06] one spot one speck one black speck in
[1:25:09] your soul you don't have any birth a man
[1:25:11] neither do they neither and they're not
[1:25:14] they're not gonna be given eternal life
[1:25:15] but he said I will forgive their
[1:25:18] iniquity and I will remember their sin
[1:25:21] no more
[1:25:24] Jeremiah 50 verse 19 I like what brother
[1:25:27] Ray says that's what he said cuz you
[1:25:30] know what God is gonna back his word up
[1:25:33] if he said it that's what he's going to
[1:25:36] do it's not like me and you say
[1:25:38] something then three days later we're
[1:25:40] gonna Nile better not do that no God
[1:25:42] didn't do that I will bring Israel again
[1:25:45] to his habitation and he shall feed on
[1:25:47] caramel and Bashan and his soul shall be
[1:25:50] satisfied upon the mount ephraim and
[1:25:52] Gilead in those days and then that time
[1:25:54] saith the lord the iniquity of Israel
[1:25:57] shall be salt far and there shall be
[1:26:01] none look bad for a while brulee but not
[1:26:06] right now
[1:26:07] it shall be sought for but it won't be
[1:26:10] found and the sins of Judah and they
[1:26:14] shall not be found for I will pardon
[1:26:17] them whom I reserved amen
[1:26:24] now let's cover this real quick right
[1:26:26] here then all right we got you know
[1:26:29] brother Dale can preach for an hour and
[1:26:31] a half and he slide it in you got like
[1:26:32] boy late' he didn't preach 30 minutes
[1:26:35] and I go about an hour and 10 minutes
[1:26:38] and everybody's going I think it has to
[1:26:44] do a lot with wisdom and what he does he
[1:26:46] runs it right under there and he hour
[1:26:49] and a half and you everybody's going oh
[1:26:50] that was good just saying just saying we
[1:26:58] all right amen got to have a little fun
[1:27:02] all right look we got to cover the
[1:27:04] captivity though because they went into
[1:27:06] captivity but I want you to see it
[1:27:08] remember I told you last Sunday that it
[1:27:10] all tied with Daniel 70 weeks and
[1:27:12] brother Brown said we had to get Daniel
[1:27:14] 70 weeks out of the way so we could get
[1:27:15] into the seals
[1:27:16] I didn't say that he did and that fifth
[1:27:20] seal is a total example of this because
[1:27:23] you got you got to know where to place
[1:27:25] them you got to know where to place I
[1:27:28] was telling them in Sunday school this
[1:27:29] morning you got there the Jews have
[1:27:31] several places there's a bosom of
[1:27:34] Abraham Old Testament back here from
[1:27:37] Calvary back right there's a bosom of
[1:27:40] Abraham that the Jews were in right
[1:27:42] people we're puttin in reserve until the
[1:27:46] blood was shed then you've got Jews that
[1:27:50] are bright there is Jews that are bribed
[1:27:53] because the first 120 in the upper room
[1:27:55] were pretty much Jews right so you've
[1:27:58] got Jews that are bribed you've got a
[1:28:01] fifth seal Jew that's going to be giving
[1:28:03] eternal life then you've got when we
[1:28:05] leave you got 144,000 Jews you got a
[1:28:09] deal with then over here at the white
[1:28:13] throne judgment that you could be given
[1:28:15] eternal life for being good to the bride
[1:28:17] so a man they're all you can't do away
[1:28:19] with the Jew just like God said he said
[1:28:21] how can a suckling woman forget her
[1:28:23] child she birthed the kids she ought to
[1:28:27] know where is that and when she had it
[1:28:28] right so now let's look at the captivity
[1:28:31] can we do this just for about another
[1:28:33] hour man y'all lonesome y'all might
[1:28:38] steal our chocolate
[1:28:40] Germans honky gate absolutely if you
[1:28:45] don't know what I say when I say Germans
[1:28:47] talking Kate people get excited about
[1:28:48] Germans or Kate so if I say German
[1:28:50] chocolate cake
[1:28:50] maybe I shot you for a minute all right
[1:28:55] now look let's look at this just for men
[1:28:57] is that okay because we we got to cover
[1:28:59] this and that way I want and I'll be
[1:29:01] speaking Wednesday night too so I want
[1:29:02] to cover something else moreover now
[1:29:04] this is Jeremiah now remember what
[1:29:06] Daniel did look at me for me Daniel when
[1:29:08] he was talking about the captivity
[1:29:11] because remember when Daniel wrote The
[1:29:12] Book of Daniel they were in captivity
[1:29:14] and they were getting ready to go out of
[1:29:16] captivity he said I looked at books read
[1:29:20] Daniel 9 he said our rif in other words
[1:29:23] in other words he did exactly what
[1:29:25] brother Branham said a prophet did what
[1:29:28] does the prophet do looks back to the
[1:29:30] previous
[1:29:30] profit so Daniel sitting here looking
[1:29:33] back at Jeremiah and he's actually in
[1:29:38] the prophecy of Jeremiah so he knows by
[1:29:41] books that in two years he's going out
[1:29:44] and Lord what are we gonna do when we
[1:29:46] get out because look the Daniel 70 weeks
[1:29:49] 70 weeks that are we're talked about
[1:29:52] here it's already past they were in
[1:29:56] captivity seventy years right right so
[1:30:00] that's already gone but it's an allegory
[1:30:02] of what's happening now because remember
[1:30:04] seventy weeks are determined and it goes
[1:30:07] all the way to the consummation that
[1:30:09] okay all right we've been through
[1:30:11] Daniels ten weeks a lot here so you
[1:30:13] ought to know where we're going with
[1:30:14] this moreover I will take from them the
[1:30:16] voice of mirth and the voice of gladness
[1:30:18] the voice of the bridegroom and the
[1:30:21] voice of the bride the sound of the
[1:30:22] Millstone and the light of the candle
[1:30:24] and this whole land shall be a
[1:30:27] desolation and an astonishment and these
[1:30:33] nations shall serve the king of Babylon
[1:30:35] seventy years all right and it shall
[1:30:39] come to pass when seventy years are
[1:30:41] accomplished then I will punish the king
[1:30:44] of Babylon and that nation says the Lord
[1:30:46] for their iniquity in the land of the
[1:30:49] Chaldeans and we'll make it a perpetual
[1:30:51] desolation remember that because that
[1:30:53] has an allegory there that has an a
[1:30:56] parable and underlying meaning because
[1:30:58] remember if we're going to talk about 70
[1:31:01] weeks of Daniel then at the end of the
[1:31:05] 70 weeks of Daniel there's got to be
[1:31:06] some kind of destruction of nations
[1:31:11] right what we'll cover
[1:31:14] okay that all right we'll cover and it
[1:31:19] shall come to pass when seventy years to
[1:31:21] accomplish so this is Jeremiah given the
[1:31:22] prophecy now let's go to jeremiah 29:10
[1:31:25] for thus saith the lord that after
[1:31:27] seventy years be accomplished at babylon
[1:31:30] i will visit you and perform my good
[1:31:32] word towards you in causing you to
[1:31:35] return to this place coming right back
[1:31:38] to what where they started okay for I
[1:31:42] know the thoughts that I
[1:31:44] towards you saith the Lord thoughts of
[1:31:46] peace and not of evil whoa
[1:31:49] now it wasn't peace a minute ago right
[1:31:52] he was pretty ill at this horsewoman
[1:31:55] that he's talking about but he's going
[1:31:57] to restore a bite now he can't restore
[1:31:59] back his bride because she's been
[1:32:01] polluted but he can bring her back as a
[1:32:05] servant he can bring her back under all
[1:32:07] these things the fifth seal Jew all
[1:32:09] that's covered under that then shall you
[1:32:12] call upon me and you shall go and pray
[1:32:14] unto me and I will hearken unto you and
[1:32:16] you shall seek me and find me when you
[1:32:20] shall search for me with all your heart
[1:32:21] and I will be found of you saith the
[1:32:24] Lord and I will turn away your captivity
[1:32:27] and I will gather you from all nations
[1:32:29] does that sound familiar gather you from
[1:32:31] all nations whether I have driven you
[1:32:34] he's one who drove him out he's the one
[1:32:37] that dispersed them right and I will
[1:32:40] bring you again into the place whence I
[1:32:42] caused you to be carried away captive
[1:32:45] then all right say ma'am
[1:32:47] all right now let's read Daniel 9 and
[1:32:51] let's look at something here for a
[1:32:52] minute
[1:32:52] and he informed me and talked with me
[1:32:55] and said Oh Daniel I am now come forth
[1:32:57] to give thee skill and understanding at
[1:32:59] the beginning of thy supplication the
[1:33:01] commandment came forth and I can am come
[1:33:03] to show thee now this is Gabriel talking
[1:33:05] to Daniel that all right Gabriel is
[1:33:08] there the angel talking to Daniel for
[1:33:11] thou art greatly beloved and therefore
[1:33:13] understand the matter and consider the
[1:33:15] vision seventy weeks are determined upon
[1:33:18] thy people who is Daniels people Jews
[1:33:22] and what is the holy city Jerusalem to
[1:33:26] do six things they got that to do six
[1:33:32] things now remember we may do this later
[1:33:36] but right now we won't because remember
[1:33:39] six things finish the white
[1:33:41] transgression make an end of sins to
[1:33:45] make reconciliation for iniquity bring
[1:33:50] in everlasting righteousness seal up the
[1:33:53] vision and prophecy and to anoint the
[1:33:55] most holy
[1:33:57] now brother Brown covered that is the
[1:33:58] six fold purpose so whatever brother
[1:34:02] Daniel whatever restores Israel back to
[1:34:05] its rightful place then six seals
[1:34:08] finishes our Redemption because the
[1:34:14] seventh seal is the seal okay but six
[1:34:17] seals finishes Redemption
[1:34:19] six fold purpose finishes the Jews
[1:34:22] Redemption the six fold purpose in our
[1:34:25] in our seals finishes the Gentile
[1:34:28] dispensation amen
[1:34:30] that all right so we can parallel them
[1:34:33] later on but what he's got to do is is
[1:34:34] we got to go through this and look
[1:34:36] finish the transgression make an end of
[1:34:37] sin and make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:34:39] bringing everlasting rights to this seal
[1:34:41] up the vision and prophecy and to anoint
[1:34:43] the most holy
[1:34:44] now listen before we get started
[1:34:49] none of Daniels 70 week time element is
[1:34:54] in the Gentile dispensation
[1:35:01] because let me show you something
[1:35:05] gracious because seventy weeks are
[1:35:10] determined so here we're going to start
[1:35:12] right here here's the captivity there
[1:35:14] seventy weeks and then that's the end of
[1:35:17] it now if there had been no Gentile
[1:35:19] dispensation that's the way Daniel
[1:35:22] seventy weeks looks continued all the
[1:35:26] way through they would have accepted him
[1:35:28] at Calvary and they would have took a
[1:35:31] rapture till they're promised to be
[1:35:35] restored right but there had to be a
[1:35:42] wild olive branch graft it in that come
[1:35:48] out and broke up the seventy weeks of
[1:35:53] Daniel if you look on the chart brother
[1:35:59] branham drew that's exactly the way it
[1:36:00] looks
[1:36:01] amen know therefore and understand that
[1:36:04] from the going forth of the commandment
[1:36:05] to restore and build Jerusalem in other
[1:36:09] words during as Renier my Cyrus this
[1:36:12] time they're coming back they didn't
[1:36:17] build the city over in Cyrus's Kingdom
[1:36:19] no he sent them back to Jerusalem right
[1:36:24] to restore and build Jerusalem until the
[1:36:28] Messiah the prince now who's the Messiah
[1:36:30] that's Jesus Christ right here we're
[1:36:32] gonna put this cross here because that's
[1:36:34] that's his time right the Messiah when
[1:36:38] he died at Calvary okay
[1:36:40] until the Messiah the Prince shall be
[1:36:43] seven weeks and what's three scoring two
[1:36:50] well sixty-two yeah that's 62 everybody
[1:36:56] got that same am clears mud or clears
[1:37:00] crystal clear as crystal all right look
[1:37:04] it's just so simple everybody
[1:37:07] and I'm gonna make a statement here if
[1:37:10] brother Branham makes a quote contrary
[1:37:13] to the Bible he's not a prophet right
[1:37:19] Bibles right first so what he says has
[1:37:23] got to fit the Bible I believe that - I
[1:37:26] don't believe brother Branham made a
[1:37:28] statement and wanted the Bible to fit
[1:37:30] that cuz here's where you going to get
[1:37:33] this big controversy over whether
[1:37:34] they're seven years left or whether
[1:37:36] there's three and a half years left
[1:37:37] the Bible says they're seven I don't
[1:37:39] have another quote from a prophet I
[1:37:41] don't need a quote from the Prophet I
[1:37:42] got the Bible the street shall be built
[1:37:46] in the walls evil in trouble it's time
[1:37:47] so during this time right here now watch
[1:37:49] 62 plus 7 69 69 69 weeks from what the
[1:37:58] building to the Messiah and after 62
[1:38:04] weeks just right in this little gap
[1:38:07] right in here the Messiah be cut off
[1:38:10] what was he cut off he was cut off from
[1:38:12] among the Jews he was killed mm-hmm my
[1:38:19] side shall be cut off but not for
[1:38:20] himself he didn't die for herself he
[1:38:23] died for us in the Jews amen he died for
[1:38:27] all but he knew who would come and who
[1:38:28] would know shake yourself just for a few
[1:38:33] minutes won't be long now watch and the
[1:38:37] people of the prince that shall come
[1:38:39] shall destroy the city in the sanctuary
[1:38:42] who was that Titus the general in AD 70
[1:38:47] from from ad 30 to AD 70 remember Daniel
[1:38:53] 9:24 since when you see the abomination
[1:38:55] coming get out of the city brother Brian
[1:38:59] said they wasn't a Christian in that
[1:39:00] city but the Jews that got left in that
[1:39:02] city eat their own kids because they
[1:39:05] didn't listen to what God said because
[1:39:09] word he cut him off when they said let
[1:39:12] his blood be on us and our children
[1:39:13] right here right at Calvary God stopped
[1:39:17] dealing with the nation of Israel
[1:39:20] I said the nation of Israel right the
[1:39:26] print shall come and destroy the city in
[1:39:28] the end of therefore she'll be with the
[1:39:29] flood remember the blood run out the
[1:39:31] streets right that's kind of awful that
[1:39:34] much blood when they opened up the gates
[1:39:36] that they killed so many people inside
[1:39:38] that city to the blood run out and until
[1:39:40] the end of the war desolations are
[1:39:42] determined in the end of the war alright
[1:39:47] so right here this is all what this is
[1:39:49] all the seven Church ages got it this is
[1:39:53] Gentile hey man sixty-nine weeks has
[1:39:58] already been according to the Bible not
[1:40:02] 67 and a half because that's why people
[1:40:06] in the message preached it that's wrong
[1:40:08] it's this way and he shall confirm the
[1:40:15] covenant this is where it is right here
[1:40:17] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:40:19] many for one week
[1:40:20] who's that he
[1:40:23] because from there no no that he's the
[1:40:27] Antichrist because look he shall make a
[1:40:33] cover man for one week and in the midst
[1:40:35] of the week he shall cause the sacrifice
[1:40:36] and oblation to cease in other words he
[1:40:39] breaks the covenant God never breaks the
[1:40:41] Covenant this he is the Antichrist now
[1:40:47] let me ask you a question
[1:40:48] are we here when that covenants made are
[1:40:52] we here when that covenants made no we
[1:40:55] are not here brother Branham yeah better
[1:40:58] not be
[1:40:58] that's what brother Graham said we
[1:41:00] better not be here well so when is the
[1:41:02] covenant made when we go in the rapture
[1:41:04] right here hey alright with that then
[1:41:09] right here he shall make a one how many
[1:41:15] a half nope one week which is seven
[1:41:18] years there's one week left after the
[1:41:22] rapture or seven years I don't care what
[1:41:24] nobody says
[1:41:25] I do not care because the Bible's
[1:41:29] telling me he shall confirm the covenant
[1:41:31] with many for one week who is he making
[1:41:33] the covenant with the Jews right here
[1:41:35] for one week after the rapture and in
[1:41:41] the midst of the week what's the middle
[1:41:45] of seven three and a half he's gonna
[1:41:49] break it cause the sacrifice and
[1:41:51] oblation deceased for the overspreading
[1:41:53] of abominations he shall make it
[1:41:54] desolate even unto the consummation and
[1:41:58] that determined shall be poured out upon
[1:42:02] the desolate so there's one week left
[1:42:05] after the rapture according the Bible I
[1:42:07] just read it to you right now now hold
[1:42:15] on a minute now the Jews now the Jews
[1:42:16] are gonna get a three and a half year
[1:42:18] message 1260 day message from two
[1:42:23] prophets and what's that going to do
[1:42:26] that's gonna save the hundred and
[1:42:28] forty-four thousand amen Bojo roll that
[1:42:33] back up down up whichever one go
[1:42:36] toward that way keep driving there you
[1:42:39] go
[1:42:40] seventy weeks are determined upon by
[1:42:42] people and the holy city right the
[1:42:48] people and the city if I got that say
[1:42:53] man it split it now let me ask you a
[1:42:58] question to finish the transgression
[1:43:01] make an end of sin may reconciliation
[1:43:03] for iniquity stop right there
[1:43:06] that's the redemption of Israel the
[1:43:09] people right come on people that's
[1:43:13] that's when they get saved
[1:43:14] that's 144,000 right here so the first
[1:43:21] three one two three happens right here
[1:43:27] cuz look they go in a rapture after
[1:43:33] they're killed 144,000 now how in the
[1:43:38] world in the name of the good Lord are
[1:43:40] you going to bring in everlasting
[1:43:41] righteousness we're gonna get four five
[1:43:45] and six all jumbled into let
[1:43:47] three-and-a-half years it don't bring in
[1:43:50] everlasting righteousness that's in the
[1:43:52] Millennium seal up the vision and
[1:43:55] prophecy that's not though I don't the
[1:43:57] most-holy nope there's a three and a
[1:44:02] half year message 1260 days when they
[1:44:06] accept it their iniquity is finished I
[1:44:09] just read you the scripture their
[1:44:10] iniquity is over with their captivity is
[1:44:13] over with they receive a new heart and
[1:44:17] they go in the rapture now they're still
[1:44:21] three-and-a-half years left to finish
[1:44:24] the seventy weeks of Daniel not to
[1:44:27] finish Jesus's ministry because he
[1:44:30] preached three-and-a-half years right
[1:44:31] here and he preached three and a half
[1:44:34] years right here
[1:44:37] pretty simple bringing everlasting
[1:44:41] righteousness seal up the vision and
[1:44:42] prophecy in our North the most holy this
[1:44:45] else yours in what the Millennium
[1:44:49] brother Branham says that knowing the
[1:44:51] most holy is us coming back to the
[1:44:54] millennium and walking into the temple
[1:44:57] now cannot happen around here cannot
[1:45:01] happen right there see how man's ideas
[1:45:06] you take a profit brother Brown says oh
[1:45:07] no it's the the last high for the three
[1:45:09] and well that is the last height for the
[1:45:11] Ministry of Jesus Christ that's the
[1:45:14] first half of his ministry that's the
[1:45:16] last half brother Branham breaks all of
[1:45:19] 70 weeks down into seven years three and
[1:45:24] a half years he preached here three and
[1:45:26] a half years he's going to preach
[1:45:28] through two prophets and there's your
[1:45:30] Daniel seventy weeks the whole thing
[1:45:31] they're gonna prophesy the last half of
[1:45:34] that Messiah week they're gonna prophesy
[1:45:36] but that's not the last half of Daniel
[1:45:38] seventy weeks that's where the problem
[1:45:40] people get because you got to take the
[1:45:42] Bible first the Bible says and he shall
[1:45:47] make a covenant with many for one week
[1:45:49] in one week equals what seven years you
[1:45:53] can't change the Bible brother Branham
[1:45:56] didn't change the Bible they just
[1:45:57] totally misunderstood what he was
[1:45:59] talking about hey man yeah okay I'm
[1:46:03] gonna read you one more can I read you
[1:46:04] one more just for a minute
[1:46:05] cuz I want to tell you what happens here
[1:46:07] everybody Romans 11 I don't think they
[1:46:09] have this but if you pull out Romans 11
[1:46:13] this is so beautiful how Paul brings
[1:46:16] this thing in and shows in Romans 11 and
[1:46:21] I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings
[1:46:22] but I'm telling you that's Bible truth
[1:46:24] right there that's not that's not the
[1:46:28] idea of a man except that man and he's
[1:46:33] always right
[1:46:34] he wrote the Bible I didn't so 70 weeks
[1:46:39] are determined if we can just read the
[1:46:40] Bible the Bible will give us our answer
[1:46:44] can you pull that up brother Roman 11th
[1:46:46] Romans 11
[1:46:48] one I say then hath God cast away his
[1:46:52] people now look
[1:46:53] watch me has God cast away his people
[1:46:55] god forbid can't forget her
[1:47:00] god forbid for I also AM an Israelite
[1:47:04] Paul puts his hips right in the middle
[1:47:06] of it all I man is right seed of Abraham
[1:47:10] tribe of Benjamin God hath not cast away
[1:47:15] his people which he foreknew what you
[1:47:18] not what the scripture saith of a life
[1:47:20] how he maketh intercession to God
[1:47:22] against Israel say Lord they've killed
[1:47:25] all that prophets and digged down thine
[1:47:27] altars and I am left alone how many of
[1:47:29] you felt that way while you as you move
[1:47:31] I'm the only one going through this
[1:47:33] problem but God said shut up shut up he
[1:47:41] answered and shut him up I have reserved
[1:47:44] to myself Elisha 7,000 men that are just
[1:47:49] like you that have not bowed the knee to
[1:47:52] the image of bale now watch even so at
[1:47:54] this present time also there's a remnant
[1:47:57] according to the election of grace now
[1:48:00] look right here let's take this and
[1:48:03] let's take this there's an imminent
[1:48:06] according to the election of grace but
[1:48:10] you and I are the bride alright now
[1:48:14] watch and if by grace it is no more
[1:48:21] works otherwise grace is no more grace
[1:48:24] but if it be of works then it is no more
[1:48:27] grace otherwise works is no more work
[1:48:30] what then Israel have not obtained that
[1:48:34] which he seeketh for right here they
[1:48:37] didn't obtain it he was married to him
[1:48:39] he wanted them to take all these
[1:48:41] promises he wanted them to be his chosen
[1:48:44] but they turned him down they cut him
[1:48:46] off amen and he had to put them away to
[1:48:53] get a Gentile bride that all right but
[1:48:56] the election hath obtained it
[1:48:59] and the rest were blinded here we get to
[1:49:02] this fifth seal the fifth seal is a
[1:49:04] blinded group of people guard literally
[1:49:10] put his hand over their eyes so he
[1:49:12] therefore being a just God he had to
[1:49:14] give them eternal life because he's the
[1:49:17] one that blinded them see now if you
[1:49:19] willfully blind yourself that's your
[1:49:21] problem
[1:49:21] point that finger like this but if God
[1:49:24] willfully blinds you he's got a place
[1:49:26] for you not for you but for the fish
[1:49:28] sealed you all right look the rest were
[1:49:30] blinded the coordinators written God
[1:49:32] have given them the spirit of slumber
[1:49:33] that's what he gave them spirit of
[1:49:35] slumber that they should not see and
[1:49:37] ears that they should not hear unto I
[1:49:41] say not just that day Paul I say this
[1:49:44] day what we're at right now because they
[1:49:49] haven't accepted the Messiah they
[1:49:50] haven't accepted Christ yet they can't
[1:49:53] will we leave and David says let their
[1:49:57] tables be made of snare in a trap and a
[1:49:59] stumbling block and a recompense them to
[1:50:01] them let their eyes be darkened that
[1:50:03] they may not see and bow down their back
[1:50:05] alway I say that have they stumbled that
[1:50:10] they should fall god forbid god forbid
[1:50:16] god forbid but rather through their fall
[1:50:20] all I don't to make you run through
[1:50:22] their fall salvation come to you through
[1:50:26] their fall right here you get to be the
[1:50:30] bride of Jesus Christ salvation is
[1:50:35] coming to the Gentiles for to provoke
[1:50:37] them to jealousy
[1:50:38] now if the fault list is list now if the
[1:50:41] fall of them be the riches of the world
[1:50:42] and the diminishing of them the riches
[1:50:45] of the Gentiles how much more their
[1:50:48] fullness for I speak to you Gentiles in
[1:50:53] as much as I am the apostle of the
[1:50:54] Gentiles I magnify my office if by any
[1:50:58] means I may provoke to emulation them
[1:51:01] which are my flesh who was him Jews and
[1:51:03] might save some of them Paul saying I'm
[1:51:07] not kicking the Jews out even though
[1:51:10] there's a door open and I'm a Gentile
[1:51:13] profit I'm not shutting the door back
[1:51:16] I'm gonna bring some of my people in
[1:51:20] amen for if the casting away of them be
[1:51:23] the reconciling of the world what shall
[1:51:26] the receiving of them be but life from
[1:51:29] the dead because he knew that all that
[1:51:32] dead tradition they were dead if they
[1:51:33] stayed there for if the first-fruit be
[1:51:37] holy the lump is holy you were just now
[1:51:41] called a lump by God I mean by Paul well
[1:51:47] God through Paul because look who's the
[1:51:49] first fruit Israel Israel is the first
[1:51:53] fruit people you're the lump I'm just
[1:52:01] telling you what God said and if the
[1:52:03] root be holy sore the branches now
[1:52:05] here's my whole point that I was making
[1:52:07] this morning in son school it's kind of
[1:52:10] odd we preach this and then we had this
[1:52:11] in Sunday school this morning cuz we're
[1:52:12] going through the book of Romans and if
[1:52:14] some of the branches be broken off and
[1:52:15] thou being a wild olive tree now what
[1:52:17] happened right here this is a pitiful
[1:52:23] example of a tree but this is the olive
[1:52:25] tree and this is Israel right now some
[1:52:30] of the branches got broke off and God
[1:52:33] came and grafted in a Gentile Brides
[1:52:38] that's what that whole when I made that
[1:52:40] mark in that mark this is the engrafting
[1:52:43] of the Gentile but you can't kick away
[1:52:46] this because where's the life the life's
[1:52:49] in the roots the life is holy the life
[1:52:54] goes up here now God put in a Gentile
[1:52:58] branch and it grew off of that life so
[1:53:02] if the first fruit be holy the lump is
[1:53:04] also holy and if the root be holy store
[1:53:07] the branch listen God didn't grasp the
[1:53:09] Gentile Church in a dead tree it was
[1:53:14] live
[1:53:16] now if some of the branches be broken
[1:53:19] off and thou being a wild olive tree
[1:53:23] work grafted in among them and with them
[1:53:27] partakers of the root and fatness of the
[1:53:29] olive tree boast not against the
[1:53:32] branches but if thou boast bearish not I
[1:53:36] mean barest thou bear'st not the root
[1:53:39] but the root thee in other words
[1:53:40] Gentiles didn't say well we ain't gotta
[1:53:42] do we can't no this is our root our
[1:53:49] whole religions built on what happened
[1:53:51] the Old Testament can't do away with it
[1:53:54] we actually have to feed off of that
[1:53:57] same tree so we can't go we're good
[1:54:02] they're bad no they got it first they're
[1:54:05] the first fruit we just was called a
[1:54:08] lump they'll wilt say then the branches
[1:54:13] were broken off that I might be grafted
[1:54:15] in hmm well because of unbelief they
[1:54:21] were broken off and thou standest by
[1:54:24] faith be not high-minded but fear for if
[1:54:29] God spared not the natural branch take
[1:54:31] heed lest he also spare not thee in
[1:54:36] other words it says in the church ages
[1:54:38] remember it says if you keep going the
[1:54:41] way you're going I'm gonna take your
[1:54:42] candlestick out a little I'm taking your
[1:54:43] lamp out and I'm turning your light off
[1:54:45] right so let's don't boast that we're so
[1:54:48] much better than Israel we're so much
[1:54:50] better than a juice look this whole
[1:54:52] thing is working together it's a that
[1:54:55] see look that's the whole plan of
[1:54:57] redemption for Jews Gentiles 144,000 v
[1:55:03] cells you and then even over here to
[1:55:05] watch on judgment where the 104 I mean
[1:55:07] we're the please we're the first virgin
[1:55:12] how can I know why I never think of
[1:55:13] foolish virgins we're the foolish virgin
[1:55:15] will be given eternal life that's the
[1:55:17] full plan of redemption for if God
[1:55:20] spared not the natural branch I'm sorry
[1:55:22] I'm taking long took heed lest he also
[1:55:23] spare not thee behold therefore the
[1:55:25] goodness and severity of God
[1:55:28] on them which fell severity but toward
[1:55:31] thee goodness in other words he severed
[1:55:34] that word means sever he severed them
[1:55:37] from God which is the Jews but toward
[1:55:40] thee goodness if thou continue if
[1:55:42] they'll continue in his goodness
[1:55:44] otherwise thou shalt I'll also shall be
[1:55:48] cut off and they also if they abide not
[1:55:52] still in unbelief shall be graffed it in
[1:55:54] for god is able to graff
[1:55:55] what ho he's able to what graft them in
[1:55:59] again graft them back for if thou wert
[1:56:07] cut out of the olive tree which is wild
[1:56:08] by nature and wert graffed contrary to
[1:56:12] nature into a good olive tree that's
[1:56:14] what happened to us how much more shall
[1:56:18] those which be of the natural branches
[1:56:21] shall be grafted back in hold on a
[1:56:26] minute let's include these people
[1:56:32] probably not brethren this should be
[1:56:35] inert of this mystery lest you should be
[1:56:37] wise in your own conceits that blindness
[1:56:40] in part is happened to Israel until the
[1:56:43] fullness of the Gentiles be come which
[1:56:47] is right here then he's gonna graph back
[1:56:50] in that good tree and so all Israel
[1:56:54] shall be safe now not every person but
[1:56:58] all predestinated Israel as it is
[1:57:01] written there shall come out of Zion the
[1:57:03] deliverer and shall turn away
[1:57:04] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[1:57:08] covenant unto them when I shall take
[1:57:10] away their sins well we go into the
[1:57:15] Millennium we're not gonna go a bunch of

[1:58:21] ever was and I made it let me tell you

[1:58:42] weren't told on this side like you're
[1:58:45] being told amen we're being told the
[1:58:50] plan of redemption or exactly step by
[1:58:52] step by step by step the plan of

[1:58:56] standing in that dimension going we're
[1:58:58] Jews we're juice and you better put a
[1:59:03] period there because that's about all

[2:00:45] tore off it was a lot in there as a lot
[2:00:50] in there see brother Daniel that's the
[2:00:53] thunder the thunders not the seal
[2:00:56] remember we read that that's - so
[2:00:58] totally separate things brother Brown
[2:01:00] said two separate things that steals one
[2:01:02] thing when that seal come off now we can
[2:01:04] put every bit of this together and that
[2:01:07] is the Thunder that's the voice of God
[2:01:09] when the seal broke the voice of God
[2:01:12] told me this right here the voice of God
[2:01:14] told you that the voice of God told
[2:01:16] William Branham laughs amen so let's
[2:01:19] just bask under the light of of the age
[2:01:23] we're living in we're living in an age
[2:01:25] that nobody nobody's ever lived like
[2:01:27] this before sure it's an evil ages the
[2:01:29] dark age it's the worst age that ever
[2:01:31] was but he put the best in the worst he
[2:01:35] put the best people in the worst age hey
[2:01:37] man let's bow our heads anybody has the
[2:01:41] need just raise your hand we won't we
[2:01:45] won't sing a song we'll just go in
[2:01:46] dismiss but if you got a need we need to
[2:01:48] pray for the ones that are not here
[2:01:50] brother Terrence and some of them would
[2:01:51] need to pray earnestly for them but if
[2:01:54] you got to need just lift your hand up
[2:01:55] pray right in your seat that's the way
[2:01:57] we believe it we believe that God will
[2:02:00] heal you without being touched you don't
[2:02:02] need to be touched by nobody but the
[2:02:03] Great Physician
[2:02:04] the only father we pray Lord that today
[2:02:07] what we've said would be pleasing to You
[2:02:08] Father and as we always say Lord give
[2:02:12] your people something though we be tired
[2:02:15] weary worn Satan comes in and like a
[2:02:20] roaring lion seeking to destroy Lord we
[2:02:24] know your word is always true your word
[2:02:27] is that type O
[2:02:29] your word is what we look to regardless
[2:02:31] as the Prophet said sunny days doesn't
[2:02:34] mean gods for you but cloudy days
[2:02:37] doesn't mean he's against you that's
[2:02:39] just part of nature in this first
[2:02:41] 3-dimension father we must look to your
[2:02:43] word as the Jews look to your word and
[2:02:46] said we are Jews we have a promise of
[2:02:49] God Lord we were Gentiles we didn't have
[2:02:54] anything we just had one thing and that
[2:02:56] was faith that you died on a cross faith
[2:03:00] that you sent your word and healed us
[2:03:02] faith that you sent your word through a
[2:03:05] little prophet in the end time to put
[2:03:07] these things together faith that we're
[2:03:11] standing here today because you saw us
[2:03:15] here you predestinated by your
[2:03:19] foreknowledge that a group of people
[2:03:22] would have enough revelation to stand
[2:03:25] one day and not just say old death where
[2:03:29] is your sting but o death you're
[2:03:32] destroyed we'll take a body change and
[2:03:35] we'll leave this place and then the last
[2:03:39] one week of that Daniel seventy weeks to
[2:03:42] get them back will be fulfilled after we
[2:03:47] get out of here father just forgive us
[2:03:48] of our sin sorry we took so long we have

[2:04:31] father just give us this day our daily
[2:04:33] bread and Jesus name we pray amen
[2:04:36] you know let me say one more thing you
[2:04:38] know we we talk about seventy weeks of
[2:04:40] Daniel and 70 weeks is seven years so
[2:04:45] seventy times seven so I 490 right it
[2:04:50] was it Peter said Jesus how do I forgive
[2:04:54] my fellow man seven times what do you
[2:04:57] say what do you say what'd he say you
[2:05:03] know what he's telling them it's gonna
[2:05:05] take 490 years to get forgiven he was
[2:05:12] talking to the Jews he said you gonna be
[2:05:15] you're gonna be and see they weren't
[2:05:17] when you say captivity they were in
[2:05:19] physical captivity during that 70 year
[2:05:22] time but they've been the under bondage
[2:05:25] for all this whole they're even under
[2:05:27] bondage now you know while they're under
[2:05:28] bondage they don't have a messiah there
[2:05:31] listen they every year a priestess
[2:05:35] before every year they take a cup called
[2:05:40] the cup of Elijah and they walk in and
[2:05:44] they have their say tour they sit down
[2:05:46] and they eat matzah and all that other
[2:05:50] stuff but they put that cup right here
[2:05:54] because the Jim knows Elijah has got to
[2:05:57] come back before Jesus can return they
[2:06:01] know that you know why because Malachi 4
[2:06:08] they take Malachi 4 as their Malachi
[2:06:12] coming because before the great great
[2:06:14] and dreadful day of the Lord they miss
[2:06:16] that that's our Elijah but they're
[2:06:19] Elijah they've set a cup there they
[2:06:21] opened the door when they get finished
[2:06:23] and they look down the street this way
[2:06:24] they look down the street this way and
[2:06:27] if they don't see Elijah walking down
[2:06:28] the street you see how literal they know
[2:06:30] Elijah's got to come back if they don't
[2:06:32] see a man walking up they step back in
[2:06:35] they grab that cup and they put it on
[2:06:37] the mantle and they say until next year
[2:06:40] and then they go about their duties but
[2:06:43] they know that's why that Moses and
[2:06:45] Elijah has got to be the ones going to
[2:06:48] the Jews they know that when they say
[2:06:50] that Elijah ministry come out they're
[2:06:54] gonna go no man the Messiah is coming
[2:06:57] but I'm gonna read it next Wednesday
[2:06:59] night remember in Zechariah our
[2:07:02] Zephaniah or Zechariah he says where did
[2:07:05] you get those scars this 140 this two
[2:07:09] witnesses are going to tell this 144,000
[2:07:12] he's not coming
[2:07:15] he came back here and you missed him and
[2:07:19] they're gonna what they're gonna go into
[2:07:21] their house shut the door and they're
[2:07:23] gonna weep for days knowing that they
[2:07:26] missed the coming of Christ but them to
[2:07:30] witness they're gonna say don't fear
[2:07:32] he's here now to that same Jesus who you
[2:07:36] crucified is fixing menhir so alive he's
[2:07:40] gonna go into your heart and he's gonna
[2:07:42] we're gonna take a rapture so God's not
[2:07:44] gonna forget him he's gonna save them
[2:07:47] when they said let his blood be us own
[2:07:49] us and our children sure that cut them
[2:07:51] off literally from getting anything in
[2:07:53] the church ages but God's gonna take
[2:07:55] that thing right there and pull it right
[2:07:56] back together and he's gonna give the
[2:07:59] Jews the baptism of the Holy go 144,000
[2:08:03] them god bless you on your way home
[2:08:04] drive safe
[2:08:06] love you with the love of the Lord
[2:08:07] you're dismissed
