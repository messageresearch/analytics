Description:
6) «  298-3       †        PHILADELPHIAN.CHURCH.AGE  -  CHURCH.AGE.BOOK  CPT.8
    In order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in "behold I set before you an open door, and no man can shut it," we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age. There is an overlapping, a melting or fading into, rather than an abrupt end and a clear cut start. This age particularly flows into the next age. And not only does this age overflow into the last age, but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age. The seventh age (a very short age) gathers up into itself for one quick work, all the evil of every age, and yet all the reality of Pentecost. Once the Philadelphian Age has about run its course, the Laodicean Age quickly comes in, bringing both the tares and the wheat to harvest,

«  40       †        Now, if we notice, the salute to this church; as we're going to start now on the 7th verse, the messenger of Philadelphia. The true Church in the--true Church in the professing church. It was a true Church in the professing.
... to the angel of the church of Philadelphia write;... 
    I have called your attention to the lapping over, each one, now. Now, you'll get here, the angel... if you'll watch the way he brought in the age of the... Methodist age lapping on, and will run over into a little bit of the Philadelphian... or to the Laodicean, Pentecostal age. Then, tomorrow night, the Pentecostal messenger comes back to rebuke these for falling, just as this age rebuked them from falling back here in Sardis (in the Lutheran age), the lapover.

«  111       †        The reason I'm saying this this way, so you can see what I mean by the lapover. See? It's from the missionary age of the door. But, you see, He had--He had told them He had the key ...

Holy Holy Holy Holy you Lov him holy holy holy he truly is risen holy and I want to see you amen and amen and amen and amen amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Revelations 3 and then we'll go back to Malachi 4 to pick up our thought from this morning uh today would have been the children's day you know the the youth having the services but because some missing they wanted to move it over to next Sunday so it be the next Sunday for the we're doing that okay uh remember the announcements that have been made and remember now that at the end of the month July the 31st brother royel Serano will be here August the 7th brother Quinn will be with us August the 10th on a Wednesday brother Reed will be with us and August the 14th brother Nester will be with us so remember that amen so you got it Revelations 3 and Malachi 4 and father we love you we thank you for everything Lord thank you for the day and the grace that we have the time Lord that you've allowed us to be able to receive and we need you so much because we know and realize that there's nothing with our within ourselves that could make anything but we rest in you and we ask you to come down speak to our hearts and our lives and Lord just forgive our sins and lead us and teach us thy ways that we may walk there in Lord we know and realize there's many sicknesses Among Us and many afflictions and you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you and we thank you guide each and every one Just Have Your Way forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of andr these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God all right we're going back to Malachi because remember what we said as it starts in Malachi 4 verse4 he tie together the entire Old Testament coming up and that's why he would say remember ye the law of Moses my servant see because that's who the word come to that's the whole Old Testament is proof of one thing from the old Old Testament look what is to do and it stands and looks forward to see the entire journey of mankind and it tells you how it's going to take place so remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him and wh for all Israel with the statutes and judgments now watch behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of now notice not Hearts turn the heart there's one heart there all right heart of the fathers to the children that was the Old Testament Saints to the New Testament message and bringing Calvary and bringing in the New Testament the kingdom all right right and then there's to be an end time to happen to what and the Heart of the children babes in Christ you remember we're still on the statute of perfect man remember we're still on Peter add to your faith see virtue all right so then we're still back with that same thought now and the Heart of the children it doesn't call them fathers that right because it's not in the end time what is to do take the children and turn them back okay take babies in Christ cuz you're not born again as adults you're born again as babies in Christ all right and to turn the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing you understand why we're using those things that to me you know to me the entire Bible ties together and makes a beautiful picture that no matter what you're at or the point you're thinking about they like I said why would he come all the way through and then summing it up and say Remember You The Law of Moses then makes his statement of the future coming see and wants to take place and showing you all the way through the complete Plan of Salvation to mankind to bring it from the the B the point of the book of Acts and the children and in the Old Testament people turned to the New Testament message all right now is to take those children that we are because we're not born again as adults right right we're born again at Faith starting our journey and now turn our hearts back to the original father's message which would cover then the entire B Bible because it would cover then as we were talking this morning that what did the prophet do he came not as he said he it's not in the beginning of his ministry but in the winding down when he begin to declare his message see now that message has come forth to you and I and that way it will turn our hearts back and what did he say on 327 of the church age book this messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 will do two things turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers you know the seven the the teachings of the word right he had to go back and pick up that to bring us to the faith of the fathers then when we get to the faith of the fathers you can start talking about the message the prophet brought amen now that's the conten that I've made from 40 years or more preaching on it to you to try to get you to see that see that's why you've got so much Scruples and problems is because you got a bunch of novices that's right you know I'm not making them unregenerated I said novices that are trying to interpret the word of God to us when they don't even know what the word is saying themselves they have Haven experienced it like I've said illustrating it all right I've got one two three three computers in my home we have a slew of them here in the building but the computer is the most damaging thing you could ever think of to this end time people because you can just pull up anything you want to instantly of what is being said and you don't you don't see the ministers that spent the 20 30 years of their lives like I had to do to study the message to search for months for a quote you know just one little thing to search and search through the message they're not familiar with the message nor the Bible that's right because they you know they're just not concerned but uh okay I'm sorry about this morning if you think I was I just kind of had a point and you'd have to know me uh all day yesterday it was there uh last night at the fellowship meeting it was there uh this morning got up with it there come here this morning with it there and when you do then uh it may sound like you're just jumping around fumbling for something but no I want you to know one thing for sure we have had a message we are not looking for a message to come we are not searching for another messenger we are not trying to find somebody else that can interpret this for us we have the Holy Spirit no matter if it's just a birth it's still the Holy Spirit as I was saying the other day why is the trouble when you know the people in the Dark Ages they gave their life for the gospel and the prophet said the same Spirit they had is the Same Spirit in us to just overcome daily well which one would be the worst looking like it look like that's a horrible time back there and it was they physically gave their lives but now you got to live daily and walk in the word of God trying to you know in this day to overcome see if you ask those people said what you know if you could show them both illustrations of where to live here or where to live here and they'd say give me the Gallas you know because that would just be something you could walk up and do but we've got to overcome what lady oia and overcome the uh sorry for wording but the Antichrist moving among the people of the message to uh pervert it to where you cannot be certain amen about what you believe you know because this quote quote quote quote quote all right but see the computers I said it's damaging because people can use it but it's also wonderful that we can use it to the benefit of being able to search out things in a hurry so forgive me if you thought well what was he doing this morning I'm telling you I didn't know that I would change the message until this morning so I had the burden yesterday had it all last night and different things and uh I just tried to drive one thing this morning we're not looking for something else to come this message is the the message that will change us from Mortal to immortality if not we you going to get it this message I believe brother Brandon's message now I'm talking about the message I explained the messenger is not in avable he made mistakes and said things wrong and different kind of things but the message is infallible all right then that message is The Headstone amen what else are you looking for was the Cornerstone the revelation of Jesus Christ we still we read that in the Baptist we studied that we talked about it now why would the headstone be some kind of other something right we'll see that in a minute when we get down to the point of trying to bring out the understanding so you know if you thought well I wonder what was he doing uh one of these days you'll understand me cuz I don't understand me okay all right what was our dealing this morning we were talking about how and Wednesday night we were dealing with it how the messenger comes at the end of the age it always comes at the end of the age we showed you the drawing Wednesday you make your choice you can say well the End of the Age brother could this be this that that's all right I showed it to you Wednesday the end of the age you can come down on the bottom and run out to here top and run out here you come to the same place I showed that Wednesday night all right but if you go one way you're going to lose a lot of the Bible you say well what does it matter just so long as we get there you're not going to get there right you mean God has spent all of this time of trying to get you and I back to the word and he's going to allow us in and let us finish up no this was just part word I don't think so it'll have to be the pure unadulterated word amen all right now we showed this morning and bringing it down how that brother Ram says in the Rapture message not in the time when he begins to sound the but when he's not when he starts out but when he he begins to sound see not when he starts let me restate it right not when he starts but when he begins to sound his message so this message came forth then by somewhere right in there about 62 you can see him driving especially when he gets to sge is this the time he begins to bring it down and laying it in and then he starts going and that's when youve seen the people start turning away from him cuz they knew what he was saying they was accepting him as a prophet and doing this that and the other until he began to say I my father's one well I didn't hear Brother R say that no I didn't hear Jesus say that but that's what he said that's why they killed him because of him saying what he was right well when around and begin to lay it down and say Malachi 4 was supposed to do this here it's done and in the message of Malachi 4 they would be the taking up all the Loose Ends and bringing it down then you see him taking up all the Loose Ends and it would Proclaim to the Rapture of the church and you see him preaching us on the way to the Future home so if you don't follow it that way I'm sorry that's just just the way I am you remember where we were talking about on the end time messenger where he said this message could not have been preached 40 years ago that's right no amen there was no way cuz you you got to have a foundation amen you got to do the first work of Malachi right right before you can do the lies part right CU look what you'd be dealing with you got to turn and they did the Old Testament Saints turned at Calvary coming in Jesus Christ from there to the New Testament message all right but see you and I had to have a restoring of the New Testament message before you can talk about the end time to turn us back to the faith of the fathers I told you don't take it I'm off a stature of a perfect man cuz that's what we were doing we've seen the statue of perfect man is the very point that turns us from what the new birth Faith to back where the disciples were and there's your faith in the fathers but have also said this for 40 years and this may sound stupid and crazy but this is the way I think I guess every wor person in the world 7 billion this day could have the new birth right it would not be the change of the body right be wonderful world H it everybody in the world could stand at the faith of the fathers be a Wonderful World there wouldn't be no change of the body cuz all you got among the disciples is a prophecy of that change the W drink the line Etc so you see where we got to get to yes it's not to just talk about these virtues to find out what they are right it's for us to strive for them to be made in their our lives by the opening of the word to where we could return to the of the fathers but where do you hear that in the message we don't need that anymore we up here in this we're over here we got this all figured out so I yeah we we got all that great Revelation that seven seal is polygamy and they got it figured out Ain you but ain't nothing you and I can do about that and I ain't concerned about it cuz I'm concerned with you and I those who want to hear yes to come to a place to where we can be changed I'm not excuse me worried about anything else I'm not worried about internet welcome to internet we have people out there that even count this our church their church and sin tith are ween we count them that's part of us but to the rest that's you but yet welcome do the best you can but let's move on in God to where we can see things but you see like I said now on the internet today I said it this morning on the internet today and the preachers around the message they're preaching about the great horrible thing that is happening in Russia brother Joe ran it all far to show where they're voting these things you know what they're voting that you can't have church in a home how many of you live in a subdivision especially built the last 20 years when you signed a covenant in that subdivision you know what you signed that you cannot have a religious service in your home with over a certain amount of people but you think we're safe do you know in this community you cannot put a church in this community this city of Lula without it being recognized and associated with a church that is in this community and established that is their law you want to go right over here we can get a witness to it he was the he was up in the and he couldn't get this church right here because one downtown wouldn't allow him to come under their Charter part he had to go over here and get a Pentecostal Church to allow him to come in this community come on Church we're saying well well look at these horrible things happen in these other places look how simple it's coming Among Us okay you don't keep up with those things do you know that in 1974 there was a law passed in Georgia that you couldn't travel over 25 miles to church how many of you came over 25 miles get here today okay 99% here but see we we don't look at that we look at it's horrible happening somewhere and it's just closing in that's right okay take it from there you see why that I'm hard and strong and talk the way I do okay but let's get into something now this afternoon from the point of what we've been dealing with about the messenger always comes at the end of the age all right the messenger coming at the end of the age is the most marvelous scriptural um what would you say for a prophet it would take a prophet to understand the statements that he made about the end of an age and I ask you the question you know end of what age right what is the end of the age to you every messenger brother around said come at the End of the Age we'll read we'll read it he said never at the beginning but was at the end of the age he said Paul came at the end of the age well if Paul came at the end of Ephesus how' he bring the message to Ephesus right then we'll let brother brandham we've let him do it but we let him do it again where he resets the things that puts things in perfect order to where that you and I can see but watch this thing that or this part that we talk about that what we're looking at so let's start reading we'll read fight this afternoon look what he says on the 70th week of Daniel he's talking about Al come Wesley and age and you know Wesley and age is called Philadelphia the greatest age age of Love ever had to Philadelphia age and John Wesley's time he went out in Pentecost he went out in come Pentecost and that was lukewarm then we go back and find out what kind of a message would come to the Pentecostals at the end and remember each one's come at the End of the Age St Paul came at the end the rest of them come down at the End St irenius all they all come at the End of the Age so we established that now we got to establish where the ends at you say well we you've already read this over and over to it right deliberately to where we could bring this message and watch the message unfold of the Prophet now watch don't pull up the overlap picture yet brother Joe but pull up the other one we was using or Brother Anderson brother Joe okay everyone's using bring up the one we was using Wednesday night that shows the entire thing of the church agent you know we we redone this in a little bit we'll see another one this one we've used for many years we used it many years we've been using this for many years all right see showing the church ages The Messengers and the length of time as I said this morning I gave it to you don't get caught up in well these Messengers this is one of those one somewhere in here Columba he died in 597 died before the age ever started don't get into that but what did we give you this morning what did Brother around say paragraphs or page 76 Ephesian Church age which is church age book The Death of Paul before the Revelation was given does not at all know the fact that he was a messenger to the Ephesian Church age for the messenger to ever age regardless of when he appears or goes is the one who influences that age for God by means of a word manifested ministry and Paul was that man all right but now we' got to establish did Paul come at the end of the age or did he come right hereen right did he come at the ending of Pentecost amen huh which way did he come go remember now when we get over here there's no Messenger to this age brother Brown says it no Messenger to the lady of s he said the Holy Ghost came himself now you said what's this drawings so but let's think about it so go ahead now remember the drawing the messenger comes at the end of the age and the overlap which is an overlap is an Open Door that's what brother Bown says and got it on in here it's okay we just keep reading but to think about it and see you got the porters we used that years ago in the message remember the porter stands at the door open the door right the shepherd brings the Sheep out and he border can close the door that's in Jesus's ministry right okay now watch so let's just think about it let's read one go ahead now and pull up number two is this the sign of the end sir in Jeffersonville so remember what he said remember the quote we just used go back go back to number one we need it P number one okay look and remember each one's come to come at the End of the Age St Paul at the end rest of them at the end watching come down to the end St irus and all the rest of them the other ones age carried over to the other one lapped over now we'll show in a minute where brother R said there is never an a direct start or an Abrupt end no that's right to an age so we're letting him say it lapped over watching and he taken it up and went on to the next age with it remember you're talking about the body of Jesus Christ right through the seven Church ages the body of Jesus Christ go ahead now number two is this a sign of the end sir he's talking about the seal tore loose Paul was the first messenger we found what did he do declared war on what what did Paul declare war on if he come is where you're saying the End of the Age like on over you know what did he declare war on Paul didn't declare war on the age of Ephesus he brought the message to Ephesus right so watch what he says he AG had his messenger Paul was the first messenger and when the first trumpet sounded and the first seal was Troke loose remember this is when he was bringing the ages The Messengers before the F seals broke Paul was the first messenger find out what did he do declared war on what not the first church age he declared war on the Orthodox Church for not believing the Messiah sign that Jesus had produced to them are you reading who did Paul rebuke the Pentecostals from getting away from the Messiah sign of the Lord Jesus Christ or the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ living among us who did he do right declared war on what now watch it a messenger rebukes the previous age brings a message to his age okay so who did Paul declare war on the Orthodox Church not the first church age right okay how about it now watch he bring in something that will be very helpful if you'll listen and think about it going to number three this is taken from the lest in church age that's preached in 60 121 I do that because Church age book is I'll always say Church age book I Define it all right the angel of this lady is in age to end it up now he will be at the End of the Age like the rest of them like the Bible come on at the end of it because the angel always comes to rebuke for them for what they done to the the angel of the Church of ladyo seea write these things Paul in the first church age rebuked them for getting away you want to read it Revelations 2 and 4 we rebuke them from getting away from their first love he's rebuking Pentecost watch him he comes to rebuke to the angel of the Church of Samar write these things each one is to the angel at the End of the Age Paul the end of the age and on down End of the Age the lap over now End of the Age End of the Age that's what makes it lap what makes it lap because the messenger comes to rebuke backward and and bring his message forward he's in the overlap what is the overlap we're going to get to it in a minute where brother R said is what it's the open door which is a revelation of Jesus Christ Paul had a message right unto the angel of the church at Ephesus he rebuked the Pentecostals right for getting away from their first love and brought the message to the church in Ephesus right now watch him see it makes a lap over to the angel speaking what was this laps over here to the angel in the end of that age see picking up right here making the lap like stair steps going up in the seven Church ages a lap over between every age it's hard to draw you'll have to look real careful go ahead brother Joe and pull this up cuz I asked them back there to do a lot of impossible things but they always do it and get it up for me so go ahead and pull it up what we tried to draw if you'll see what we done we pulled them together where the other had to do it like this but now you can see it better here cuz you can't see it over there in the dark look here there's your overlap there overlap between every age there never an Abrupt end of Ephesus a start of samna God never does anything like that I love him for that the one that really caught me to show his grace is when brother brandham said God dealt with Israel 40 years after Pentecost you said we did he give them the Holy Ghost no they had to come up in the church to do but he dealt with them he didn't stop dealing with them until after Titus come in and Destroy Jerusalem 40 years that God was dealing with him after they had rejected him what a wonderful God you and I serve watch this as we catch the overlap now see you say where did Paul come right here which was Pentecost right here Iranians Falls Martin Columba and an overlap God makes an overlap but what is the overlap well it's just this one age running into this age no it's not remember this statement until Wednesday there has never been a bride in an age show it to to me we're in lady OA yes physically speaking it's out here but we're supposed to be born out of the age well no we still in the age boy you really I thought the new birth called us out of the age right Y into Christ right so then remember the lifeover now it'll be between each one never an ending of one age and a start of another you would not have the lap over if you done that you got to let one lap into the other that's right you realize in the days uh let's see can I quote I'll get names wrong so I won't try somebody wanted brother brand this is a story told you probably heard it one brother Rand would go talk to their father I believe it was he's up in age brother Ram goes to talk to him and he's in ner life in and having a big time when he comes out they ask him what about it said your daddy is in another age amen you realize God is so great until he didn't tell it to all the lutherans that when Wesley started his message that all you people are lost that don't take his word right now it was years back there before the message could spread from one place to another so it's an overlap overlap the overlap is not just age that's why your messenger stand there overlap is a revelation of Jesus Christ that's where your messenger stands in that revelation of Jesus Christ rebuking the ones getting away from it bringing the message forward okay go ahead let's pick it up he said that's this lap over here he said that's what makes it lap that the Messenger stand in a position so go ahead to number four it makes him stand in a position in what just standing somewhere where is the messenger standing in Jesus Christ right that's his message it's an Open Door amen it's a leftover Paul had the message of Jesus irenius had the message of Jesus yes right your lap over is the Revelation that's right TimeWise it's a man standing with the message that's why that if you look back at the drawing you can't figure out by the date of the age of the person was and put it in the place right Columba was that was dead years dead before the age ever started now your's where I was this morning do you realize what a prophet is have you ever thought about it yes a true prophet of God you realize what he is we talk about him as being what God's mouthpiece right the one who speaks for God so now John on patmas right he wrote the message to each Church age right yes now was that God doing that we have to agree right God placed the ages with the churches that was there around in that area and placing it to John right God placed the ages your Prophet said the one closest to the truth why did he not choose go to your church age book and read it brother R spoke twice as much of polycarp as he did irenius read your church hbook took tce as much time talking about polycarp but what did he say he said polycarp lent to organization he said and that was the reason he was rejected as the messenger you know what he's saying you ever thought about that who rejected what to do what he said and that was the reason he was rejected you know evidently brother Brown probably had him wrote down is the Angel right come on why would he say it that away he said polycart was rejected so he probably had it wrote down Paul polycarp and God says no son that's it's not here it's ireneus and Paul brother R went back and checked out polycarp's life I read a little bit out of the pren in fathers polycarp had a great Revelation the only thing brother R City could find was he lent towards organized religion you understand what I mean brother Ram was probably going to put polycarp there course there's no name to the ages F the holy spirit said uhuh who put Martin there who put Columba who put Luther Wesley and who put the holy ghost coming on the day of zusa Street in the fullness of the baptism it's what your Prophet said we're going to read it we've done read it over and over right who put him there who picked the messengers was it brother brandham that's the point I'm trying to get you to see John wrote the ages and the who it's too you know Ephesus samna per brother brandham had to be in the same spirit that John had right y and then he put Paul irenius Martin Columba don't you think brother Ram knew that Columbo wasn't even born in that age he done a lot of research so was the age over here or was the age over here was it matter because no bride no Born Again believer fever is in a church age my brother brandom could say lady yosia is over then need say lady oia will end when the bride is taken out then he'll say lady osia the 7th will go all the way through the Millennium he knew what he's talking about it's us sit down right you so what's the importance of that I want to make sure I'm in that overlap right if we're not in the overlap we're not called out of the church now may I remind you of something that own the drawing in your of the where it was draw out at Jeffersonville you better believe there's no bride in an age if you don't you got a lot of trouble the blackness in there was not the bride have you got that much sense the Blackness was not the bride you know what the last age was brother random said I left a little light he said because it went into total darkness if you can't look out turn now and see how dark lady yourself is you're you're sure spiritually blind right but you see the bride was never in that age you said we're in the bride age every age at a bride age right amen there's a great meaning to that we'll get on it Wednesday what are you looking at it I want to be in the overlap I want to be where the messenger at don't you come on is that right the scripture said we got to go out under him he was crucified outside the camp well I you stay in the camp no no that's not Bible it's Bible to go out of the camp to where he's at out of Lady OA into Christ well what you mean we're still in let you see it I hope you got sense to realize I got a little sense and can can look around the AG is there but we're supposed to be called out of the age that's right that's why the scripture would say love not the world and the things of the world because that's the age okay I'm slow but listen let's go ahead I want to make sure that CU we're going to deal a lot with this overlap even we have to cut some others but look at number four we've been over this one in the first seal brother brandham explains the church ages and look what he says then Along Came the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they cabbaged down on that yeah there cannot be no more a ages that's all of it listen that's the philad r not the that's the lady oan age and we found in the study of the scripture that the messenger come to the end come to the age Messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time Paul came come at the End of the Age we find out at renius at the End of the Age Martin at the End of the Age look Luther the end of the Catholic age there is no Catholic age of the seven Church ages but it's a Catholic age because it's a Dark Age the Thousand Years of Darkness of the Catholic church and Luther comes out of that Darkness stands in the overlap what is his overlap the revelation of the just shall live by faith that's what made the overlap yeah that's right he stands in the Revelation look at him Luther at the end of the Catholic and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age so now he's telling you Wesley comes at the end of Luther's age all right now that's what he had to say Wesley we think that what Wesley came at the end of Luther's age he didn't come up here he come at the end of Luther's age and he overlap come on read your message and then what did he say took place and Pentecost at the end of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost so at the End of the Age of Wesley come who oh Elijah came hold on be a point look and at the end of the Pentecostal age the Holy Ghost came we're going to reread that one right at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word now you know what Pentecostal age Pentecostal AG is Lady OFA right you're not talking about back there in the Bible it's the Pentecostal age is the lady OFA and age I got to quote if you need it and we're supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight not to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church now where did Brother randam come into being at then all right where would it take place we'll get back to it in just a minute but I was trying to find it I've got it in here it's in the the questions and answers on the seals I got on one of the other he said no Messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came in his fullness onusa street but see everybody in the message well zusa Street didn't have nothing brother R said it had the fullness of the Holy Spirit the fullness of the baptism he calls it another great prophet but we don't may I quot it this way Paul said I become your enemy because I tell you the truth have I become your enemy because I can remember and have read cuz I was reading this and teaching this before the computer ever come into being amen you know for me right I was teaching this in the the late 60s and early 70s right no problem all right we'll get to that in a minute but just remember if you need it I'll be glad to find it in in my message somewhere if not we can find it in a hurry see why because the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost ausa Street Pentecost now back onusa street the Holy Ghost came himself so what your Prophet said I've give it to you two or three times if you need it brother Joe if you can find that part I had it in my notes and I got it laying here in my Bible somewhere and if you need it I can find it in here CU I don't say nothing and I can't prove the prophet said it okay okay we got it paragraphs is paragraph 52 on questions and answers on the SE paragraph 52 and you see each one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit I watch you that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age the oneeyed black man was not listed as one of the ear early as one of the church age angels you only have seven angels brother Brown calls him the messenger right but he's not one of the Angels why because it's the Holy Ghost himself look that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no matter Messenger to the age cuz the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of his baptism I surely don't hope you think that's brother brandham go here but at the end of the age as it always ends upon the others we F find there then the messenger sin and all of these Scruples and things right so you're a prophet know what he was talking about but we said no zeusa Street didn't have nothing they just oh they just didn't have nothing he called it the fullness of the baptism okay that's paragraph 52 questions and answers on the seals 1963 okay I want to get this overl go ahead to number five Philadelphian Church age the angel appears right at the end time just at the end times to rebuke the church for it for losing its first love and how it's got away from God like they did that's Paul rebuking Pentecost for losing his first love Orthodox church we read that a minute ago like they did down through there the ages and that time the Rapture comes to take the church home the church goes up just at the time of the message what message brother Run's message right I thought it was to reveal the secrets same thing tonight what the angel messenger comes to back going up we're reading down here to rebuke them each age like that for what they had done so that makes a lap over in each one of the church ages just lap right back over there one another like that is climbing up like a steps it's laying it makes a over laap okay I got a lot more here let's drop over where does this laugh over take place drop to number nine brothers we're going to have to get fast cuz time's running out number nine this is the Philadelphian Church age reveals himself the open door between the two ages now watch it it wasn't in the lady youan age neither was in this other one the Philadelphian age but it was between the lap over because I'll prove it in just a few further down and you'll get it you'll see it makes it so rich what about it not this this lap over is not in the Philadelphian age it's not in the Lan age it's in between what was that lap over that was your isusa street Holy Ghost it came in his fullness do you realize that the name of Jesus is what we're talking about we're going to read it you know the name of Jesus begin to be restored between the sixth Church age and the seventh one the name of Jesus began one that's never started until about 19 and 11 10 11 12 right in there with the name of Jesus you mean brother Dale the name of Jesus had to be restored that's what your Bible says your Prophet says it well what did they call him in between Charlie Joe Kim John who what oh you're smart what does it mean when you say the name has to be restored it's not that you lost the name it's the meaning of the name and the meaning of the name was the person an Open Door let's read it next one we'll get it going to the next all right number 10 excuse me wait a minute let me see we may still be in number nine yeah stay on number real I said what is the open door he reads the scripture set before the inopen door what is the open door the open door comes in the lap lap over right not in Philadelphia not in lady oia now come on church then you'll see why the Holy Ghost came himself on the day of Pentecost go has got to all back into the age of Wesley and begin to bring the truth and come on out into the age of Lady oia watch him what is the open door the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ what did he say to his first church back there back in this age he said I am am he that was which is shall come I'm the first in the life right message to the first age I am the almighty he said it three different times made himself deity to the first church here before he went into the last Church age he said I set before you an open door and if you want to see the Revelation here is where he would build his church and the only way that he could take his church is back to the revelation of what he is it's not a messenger standing between time that's why you don't even have to be in the Age part it's his Revelation come on Paul and them I mean uh West and them were trinitarians right but you want to read some of the little books M I've got about you want to read how he bragged on Jesus for being God but then when he finalized it up he said but said he is the third third person of the Trinity because he didn't know the Revelation right and God begin to restore the name and it was lost and couldn't be found the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ begin to be restored where between the sixth age in the seventh in the lap over right Amen in the open door that's right come on folks if you missed the whole rest of the message remember this Prophet that we speak of Elijah of this day we he knows the Lord Jesus Christ but he had to have a man to work through do you realize he stood between man and Eternity in the open door do you realize his message is the open door you realize his message opened heaven to where we could go right am his deity if you want to see it go ahead to the next one that was a Philadelphia that was paragraph 140 uh 1- 143 this is paragraph 128 the Philadelphian church now what door was opened about Jesus between these two ages see just between 1906 about when the Methodist age and the Dwight Moody of them and them faded from the scene there come forth A Break Forth there come forth they break forth of the people receiving the Holy Ghost speaking with tongues and things come back into the church that's about right in about 1906 along in there all right what took place then after that begin to come along the first thing you know they organized now he even names of people that started doing it they organized the old General Council which went in which went in now called the Assemblies of God what see out of the church out of that church that was lapped over and what took place to them he said an Open Door a revelation of his Supreme deal is the open door the revelation of Jesus Christ coming back to the church the name of Jesus being restored we've got out of our Hope from looking at laugh over and ages and things and thinking about a man standing put him standing there in the Revelation that he's got you realize in this messenger stood where no man has ever stood between Time and Eternity in the overlap which is an open door between the ladyo see and age and Eternity putting him coming at the end of the age to bring the message end of what eight age of Time Eternity is not an age he stood between to bring the message in the lap over the open door what about it Church see that's what makes the lap over an Open Door what makes the lap over watch what he says go to 10 now let him say to you where you won't be fuss and we be about it this is the message of baptism of the Holy Ghost 1958 but he said Just Between the Methodist and Pentecostals going out you know going out of Methodist coming into Pentecostal I have set an open door before you there you are the name restored again I have set an open door but I'm the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father except through me what is it that Open Door you realize that you and I right now by the revelation of God are standing in an open door not in Philadelphia not in lady oia the revelation of this message has called us out of the age into Jesus Christ and he's the word so the prophet's message then is what the headstone amen let's see if I can think of the quote in the something he's a Cornerstone in the full Church he's The Headstone that's a direct quote on the last part I know in the church like you know he was the Cornerstone but said in the entire bride he's the headstone this is the age excuse me this is the age when the entire revelation of Jesus Christ is to be brought forth it's not just talking about ages and buildings and places and doings is to illustrate to try to show where we're at see we're supposed to be called out of the age but you know what our biggest problem is we're L we're uh too much spiritual to be worth a lot natural because of what we're thinking about well we're too much natural to be very much spiritual right cuz we still are in the age time is out here but we're supposed to be in Jesus Christ and when God looks down and sees his bride in the end time he sees her standing wrapped in his robe of righteousness the revelation of Jesus Christ what is the message of this age how much greater could any man have ever spoke about Jesus Christ than this Prophet messenger amen but yet I ask you how many of you ever read this church age book I ain't asking for no raising hands afid it might be embarrassing cuz you know you go I got half of it how many of you ever read to seal a book how many ever read all the books we got one hand back there that says she's read every book and I believe her yeah she may not have all the books I have but she's read all she's got but she may have more than I've got but I've read every book that I have why because if I'm going to believe this message to be the end time message I don't have to worry about trying to find anything else I'm not concerned with Russia doing this or this doing that you know there was somebody telling me who was it that brother this morning telling me that they're saying that Obama is the King of the South and and Putin's a king of the north boy they got a good Revelation none of that ain't got nothing to do with the Antichrist that's right oh yeah both of them's Antichrist that's no problem but that's that's not what you're talking about see I don't mind preaching to people that know what the prophet has said because you at least got to admit that I'm bringing what he said amen well you've left this out bring it to me bring it to me something I've left out and I'll read it to you because I want to be right but you see church it's not natural things or overlaps or places or what it's a revelation of Jesus Christ I thought brother brandham said that that was what the new birth was off of Christ of mystery that it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well then what would he say in Christ of Myster what is The Headstone y it be the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you in the highest high highest height of where it's supposed to go to why wouldn't you want to know about Jesus but yet you know all about everything else and world right they life at any and I because we can't you know we can't even order something off of a computer we're computer illiterate I use mine for what I need but yet you know all about that but do you know about the seals do you know about about the restoration of the Bri tree do you know about Daniel 70 weeks we proved that in the talking to the ministers yeah out of 30 ministers maybe five or six of them had never read the book of Daniel 70 weeks but yet they could tell you how wrong you are never read the book A lot of them didn't even have a book but they can tell you all how wrong you are at least church we ought to be the most Jehovah Witness reading room people that has ever been and I'm not making lie to them to have a great thing they sit down and read and they get get it all figured out and when they come to your house you say so and so they say so and so you say so and so they say so cuz why cuz they trained right you ask the people this man I don't really know like one preacher said one time he said now he said that adoption is simple but he said that stature of perfect man is deep well I thought that's what it was I thought the statue of prect man told you I to come to adoption we're going to get to that we're heading that way I thought that's what told us how to become adopted what about it come on brothers let's just quit I for out my heart to you I told you I had a burden last night and I had to get it off this morning off of that part to try to bring the the things into the right place and to make sure cuz you see now they're going to start moving in because they've got to and do you think that the Believers of this message won't turn you in they think they're doing God a service you think all these on the internet claiming brother Brown was wrong you think they're not trying to say they're doing you a service to save you from this cult what about it but do you see why there is an overlap because listen it's one Revelation overlapping into the next one all right this is coming forth the next messenger goes back overlaps his message and carries it right on May I quote brother R all of the prophets in the bible what did they do they made an illustration I'm not saying he was wrong I'm just saying I doubt a lot of he knowed each other but what's he saying he said no Prophet would bring his message until he checked it with a prophet before him that's paraphrasing but it's close enough he checks his message by the prophet before that's how Daniel knew that he was going to be out of there in two years because he lefted it back to the other one you look at those Church ages Paul coming in there with that great Revelation listen and brother Brandon says the pure unadulterated word lasted for ages then it began to deteriorate you realize Paul when ireneus come along he looked back to Paul when Martin came along that R around on credits as being the greatest of all never hardly a meeting that he didn't have signs and wonders in Martin's life but he look back to the one before him and said I'm lined up what about brother brandom standing looking all the way back oh he bypass Luther and wesle him because didn't it now you better believe one thing for sure if you got the Holy Ghost today you ain't going to reject Luther's message of that just shall live by faith that's right now he's teachings of other things the godhead and thing but remember God winked at those ignorances but he don't wink anymore right that's right right he commands all men to repent the scripture say we have no excuse would you see I could stand and Shake Martin Luther's hand and say thank God for the message you brought of the just shall live by faith and I ain't going to look down but now you just kind of a little mixed up you know now you ain't up here where we at oh I left it laying and N thing where Joe ran it off when something to similar if you think you're something you just going to find out you ain't nothing that's the best way to say it do you understand then we'll go into the bride age and then we'll pick up another message or two that is the messenger would come at the end of the age he would rebuke the people of the previous age from getting away from their messenger and then he bring the message brother Ram what did he say he said to paraphrase but he says the the Baptist can look the if I get them wrong put them you put them in the right place he say like the Baptist can look at the Methodist and and tell them they're wrong and he said the Pentecostals can look at them and tell the Methodist said wrong I'm paraphrasing but very close he said but I can look back and tell them all they're wrong you know little a prophet stands before no one that's why all these goofballs think they're doing something you can't correct a prophet amen we talking about it last night what do you think about the prophet that was told to go marry a prostitute and have children bu now that's contrary to the Bible isn't it right how is God going to condemn that Prophet when he told him to do it right it was contrary to the word to go do it come on I got a lot of questions that I love to ask people those are things that maybe we don't have to figure out they're there that's right what is he going to judge Everybody by the word for the age he's not going to judge the Baptist by the Methodist message he's not going to judge the the Methodist by the Pentecostal message he's not going to judge you and I by Methodist Baptist Pentecostals or whatever he's going to judge us by this message that has been brought to you and I and judge us because we haven't made ourselves available to the message well brother D we just don't have time I got to do this that and the other my mother would get up in her day and she'd cook breakfast before we got out of bed when we went to the field day lot we got up we watered and fed the mules or whatever was going to work that day and went on to the field by 9:00 mama was in the field it didn't matter what we were doing doing she was there working
