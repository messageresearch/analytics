[2:54] we can do it but we really appreciate
[2:56] the lord appreciate the day and the hour
[2:58] that we're living if you'd like turn in
[3:00] your scriptures turn where we've been
[3:02] reading from from romans 7
[3:04] and we'll continue our thought
[3:07] on the
[3:08] the message we've been trying to bring
[3:10] unto you and pray that the lord will
[3:12] bless you i've asked you to read the
[3:14] message of the prophet where he was
[3:16] preaching on the invisible union
[3:18] and you know keep on reading that
[3:20] because you may find a lot of good
[3:22] things in it
[3:24] that you didn't find the time before
[3:27] in doing that amen let's pray father we
[3:30] thank you
[3:31] for your loving your grace and to us we
[3:33] thank you for the hour that we have the
[3:35] time lord upon the earth that we can
[3:37] actually even just
[3:39] bow our heads and pray unto thee in
[3:41] public form
[3:42] lord that we could let our light shine
[3:45] to the world to that they could see that
[3:48] we believe that jesus christ is raised
[3:50] and living among us and lord
[3:52] our love in our heart is for one thing
[3:54] and that's for your word
[3:56] and for your people
[3:58] we pray that you would just bless each
[4:00] one remember the sick among us
[4:02] remember those lord the lords of the
[4:04] loved ones and just be with each and
[4:06] every one have your way with each one
[4:08] guide us now
[4:10] more of anything else forgive our sins
[4:12] because we want to stand complete in you
[4:14] in the atonement have your way now as we
[4:16] read your words you come and speak to
[4:18] our hearts and our lives in jesus name
[4:21] amen
[4:23] romans 7
[4:27] through six
[4:29] no ye not brethren for i speak to them
[4:31] that know the law
[4:33] has the law hath dominion over a man as
[4:35] long as he liveth
[4:37] for the woman which hath and husband is
[4:39] bound by the law to her husband so long
[4:42] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[4:44] she is loose from the law of their her
[4:47] husband
[4:48] so then if while her husband liveth she
[4:51] be married to another man she shall be
[4:53] called an adulteress
[4:54] but if her husband be dead she is free
[4:56] from that law so that she is no
[4:58] adulteress
[4:59] though she be married to another man
[5:02] now watch what he's saying wherefore my
[5:04] brethren are therefore or listen now
[5:07] my brethren you als you also are become
[5:11] dead to the law
[5:13] by the body of christ that you should be
[5:15] married to another even to him who is
[5:17] raised from the dead
[5:18] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[5:20] god for when we were in the flesh the
[5:23] motions of sin which were by the law did
[5:26] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[5:28] unto death
[5:29] but now we are delivered from the law
[5:31] that being dead wherein we were held
[5:34] that we should serve in the newness of
[5:36] the spirit
[5:37] and not in the oldness
[5:39] of the letter you may be seated the lord
[5:41] add his blessing to the reading of the
[5:44] word
[5:46] i think brother aaron said he had three
[5:49] three kids sick this morning so his wife
[5:52] and the two boys so remember them
[5:54] and keep them in your prayers
[5:57] now
[5:59] we've been on this topic for quite a
[6:01] while now of
[6:03] speaking of marriage and divorce trying
[6:05] to cover the scriptures and the things
[6:06] you know and the things the prophet has
[6:09] said
[6:10] about marriage and divorce and
[6:12] we won't be dealing in that we've come
[6:14] through the series part
[6:16] and we've got over to the point of
[6:18] trying to speak on the invisible union
[6:21] and i pray that if you haven't heard
[6:23] these messages you know that you would
[6:26] listen to the things
[6:28] but now that you would listen as we're
[6:29] trying to go into
[6:31] an understanding now of a deeper depth
[6:36] because that's what we want to do we
[6:37] want to keep on going until it unfolds
[6:40] and keeps unfolding
[6:42] you know down the line unto us to where
[6:44] we can see
[6:46] christ and see what was to what's to be
[6:49] in our day
[6:52] now
[6:52] we've gonna be speaking in
[6:55] on this and and you know i've got a long
[6:57] title written across mine so you don't
[6:59] have to put all of that because i got
[7:01] marriage and divorce where we keep up
[7:03] with where we're going
[7:04] and then got the thought is we're on the
[7:06] invisible union
[7:08] and i'm asking you to keep studying that
[7:10] message
[7:11] and then what we're going to speak of
[7:13] today in the two services and then
[7:16] probably next sunday morning
[7:18] will be on a threefold revelation
[7:22] to be received from
[7:24] a reading of the invisible union
[7:26] you know a three-fold it doesn't mean
[7:30] it's threefold means that it's showing
[7:32] you
[7:33] uh the same basics of anything but
[7:37] showing it in a threefold manner or
[7:39] covering it because the whole bible is
[7:42] um the new birth
[7:46] all right that's what we'll be dealing
[7:48] with this morning
[7:49] then the the grace of marriage and
[7:52] divorce
[7:53] we'll be dealing with that the lord
[7:54] willing this afternoon
[7:56] and then uh speaking on
[7:59] as paul was covering about law and grace
[8:03] all right and the prophet says this is a
[8:05] greater portion
[8:07] of marriage and divorce it's not just uh
[8:09] just speaking on that part it goes into
[8:11] a deeper depth and understanding but i
[8:15] want to speak on it to where we can get
[8:16] a a good understanding
[8:19] because
[8:21] we read from here in romans that a
[8:24] woman's husband must be dead
[8:27] uh there is no scriptural grounds
[8:29] in the bible that you can find for the
[8:31] woman to be able to divorce her husband
[8:34] now there is a
[8:36] case or two because jesus gave it that
[8:38] if man puts away his wife except it be
[8:40] for fornication
[8:42] you know then he's in trouble so it's
[8:44] not a lot in there about being able to
[8:46] just do this or do that you know
[8:48] it's got to be
[8:49] laid in the correct order
[8:51] but paul says the woman's husband must
[8:54] be dead
[8:55] and he's typing it or illustrating you
[8:58] know showing it an example
[9:01] of how that her husband must be dead
[9:04] before she could be married to another
[9:06] man all right and then he goes to show
[9:09] that that it's speaking of christ in the
[9:11] church
[9:13] see because that's what we've got to do
[9:15] we've got to see our old husband
[9:17] dead
[9:19] all right now you'll find it in each one
[9:21] of these threefold manner that we'll be
[9:23] speaking on or threefold revelation
[9:25] whatever you want to call it
[9:28] that each one will be dealing with the
[9:30] death of the old husband
[9:33] all right because that's is he in the
[9:36] body of christ
[9:37] we are feminist
[9:39] no matter how much masculine you think
[9:41] you are in the body of christ you better
[9:43] hope and pray to god that you're you're
[9:45] feminist because that would make us the
[9:47] bride of jesus christ and we certainly
[9:49] want to be that we don't want to be
[9:51] something to try to make ourselves to be
[9:54] the wrong thing so in doing that we're
[9:56] going to have to be dealing with the
[9:57] death of the old husband
[9:59] you know you say well now brother dale
[10:02] uh you know i i never was
[10:05] uh you know i've
[10:06] i've been a good person all my life well
[10:09] great
[10:10] that's commendable
[10:12] but are you born again
[10:14] see that was the first doctrine
[10:17] of the lord jesus christ
[10:19] in other words the first
[10:21] doctrinal thing that he began to deal
[10:23] with was there in john 3 you must be
[10:27] born again
[10:29] because if we're not born again the
[10:32] bible doesn't apply to you and i
[10:36] we say it's my bible that's right she
[10:37] paid for it
[10:39] but that's
[10:40] that doesn't make it belonging to you
[10:43] see the word of god comes only to the
[10:45] children of god
[10:47] it is not written to the world now it is
[10:49] to the basis that the world can take it
[10:51] and become christians
[10:53] but the writings in the bible is not to
[10:55] a sinner
[10:58] it's the and you look at each one like
[11:00] romans in ephesians to to
[11:03] the ones in christ jesus
[11:05] see
[11:06] that's that's the ones it's written to
[11:08] because it's a sinner can't understand
[11:10] the bible that's where the trouble is at
[11:12] it's people trying to understand it
[11:14] without having the new birth
[11:16] all right see then you you come forth
[11:18] within just any kind of a thought or an
[11:20] idea
[11:22] and you think it's well i'm telling you
[11:24] what the word says
[11:25] yeah and it's like the prophet said that
[11:27] time you know the bible says judas says
[11:29] carrot went and hung yourself you go
[11:31] over and pick up another scripture and
[11:33] says go do likewise all right i don't
[11:35] told you two scriptures what are you
[11:36] going to do about it
[11:38] well see i didn't tell you two
[11:39] scriptures i put my thought in between
[11:42] to inject a thought to it and i didn't
[11:45] tell you what the bible said
[11:47] but yet i gave you the letter of it
[11:50] that's why paul tells us that the letter
[11:52] killeth
[11:53] he said but the spirit giveth life
[11:56] the in in it and the scriptures plainly
[11:58] tell you jesus said no man can call
[11:59] jesus a christ or a curse you know is
[12:02] the point there but you can't call jesus
[12:04] a christ unless you're born again
[12:06] he said well i can say it with my mouth
[12:08] that's good
[12:10] that's wonderful you might have even
[12:12] could have been there people stood there
[12:13] and looked at him what about the people
[12:15] that were around him that seemed the
[12:17] dead raised the sick healed the things
[12:19] take place and turned around and
[12:21] crucified him
[12:22] the very religious people that were
[12:24] supposed to be
[12:26] the ones that would believe him when he
[12:27] would come
[12:29] they were the ones that killed him
[12:31] because he was contrary to what they
[12:34] thought
[12:35] but yet he come exactly according to the
[12:37] word but it wasn't the way they had it
[12:39] figured out
[12:41] so then when we try to figure it out
[12:42] some other way than what god says about
[12:44] it or we approach it even in some other
[12:47] way
[12:49] how are we going to get there
[12:51] see everybody wants to know about
[12:52] marriage and divorce or grace of
[12:54] marriage and divorce you know
[12:56] because they got marital problems
[12:58] they want to know how to get them
[12:59] straightened out or something
[13:01] well
[13:03] if you're not born again why are you
[13:05] worried about it
[13:09] right right
[13:10] come on you're not born again why worry
[13:13] about anything
[13:14] eat drink and be married because
[13:15] tomorrow you die
[13:18] amen
[13:20] so then my point is trying to drive it
[13:22] hard if you and i are not born again why
[13:24] do we worry about anything
[13:26] well i'm concerned about this is any way
[13:28] i can straighten this up
[13:30] if you're not born again you can't
[13:32] because it's not even in the lineage
[13:35] it'd be like me running around saying
[13:36] i'm a jew
[13:41] no i'm not
[13:42] i mean i don't fit in the category
[13:44] all right but now i get the point of
[13:46] what we're trying to do
[13:51] is we're going to talk on
[13:53] a threefold manner which we will use the
[13:55] same message
[13:57] quote scripture etc
[13:59] in three messages of the basis
[14:03] and in doing that then i'm wanting you
[14:05] to see that it's what it's applying to
[14:09] all right so let's take it as a first to
[14:11] the point that if jesus said you must be
[14:13] born again
[14:16] all right
[14:17] because there's no need as i said to
[14:19] deal with anything else
[14:21] until we're born again
[14:23] oh boy i believe we're in the end of the
[14:25] world well what's good to us if we're
[14:27] not born again
[14:28] it just means we're fixing to get
[14:30] annihilated
[14:31] right
[14:33] and that's not too happy of a point
[14:36] but think about it now
[14:38] see taking the message to understand our
[14:42] journey
[14:45] and i believe that the entire bible is
[14:48] telling you about the new birth
[14:51] all right
[14:52] now telling us how to be born again
[14:54] telling us we must be born again all
[14:56] right i believe the entire bible then
[14:58] will be covering in marriage and divorce
[15:00] to straighten out our marital problems
[15:02] and our situations of life
[15:05] all right and then i believe that it
[15:07] climaxes with an understanding
[15:10] about separating from law and grace
[15:15] he said what i need to know about law
[15:16] and grace i'm born again
[15:19] well
[15:22] you sure got a lot of bible to
[15:24] understand
[15:25] to go with that
[15:26] that's where we just have to take it and
[15:28] gradually go along and i know i'm slow
[15:31] but
[15:32] that's the way i'm mate
[15:34] but and i know i repeat myself a lot
[15:38] i do
[15:39] i deliberately do
[15:41] because at least repetitive can be
[15:43] remembered
[15:44] one time you
[15:46] can hear it and get about a third of it
[15:48] and
[15:49] and remember some of it but if you just
[15:51] keep saying it over and over
[15:53] i always say in school it got boring one
[15:55] plus one equals two
[15:58] one plus one equals two got into first
[16:00] grade you know that was it second grade
[16:03] one plus one equals two
[16:05] you finally get up about the fifth grade
[16:06] in our day and you finally got to two
[16:08] plus two
[16:09] because everybody now you know there's a
[16:10] whole lot quicker than we was but you
[16:13] know we was a little slower because
[16:15] we didn't get to come to school too
[16:16] often we was all farmers out plowing the
[16:19] mules you know and so the teacher
[16:21] realized well they hadn't been here for
[16:23] the past two weeks so we better go over
[16:25] one plus one equals two you know or
[16:27] something like that but you know just
[16:29] honest you know
[16:31] comical way of saying it but honest
[16:34] i like to keep repeating myself
[16:37] it may be boring to you but paul said
[16:40] it's needful that i say these things
[16:42] unto you again all right
[16:45] now in doing that then let's talk about
[16:47] the new birth
[16:50] see and then we can see that the whole
[16:52] bible
[16:53] will relate around it and if we just
[16:55] have to deal with a new birth today in
[16:57] both messages that's no problem
[16:59] but
[17:02] see the reason we must be born again
[17:06] he said well we're good people you know
[17:08] we're
[17:09] raised in church well that's good
[17:12] the jews lived in the church
[17:14] i mean those pharisees that's just where
[17:16] they lived at
[17:17] they was there all the time
[17:20] but that's the one jesus was talking to
[17:24] when he said you must be born again
[17:27] now
[17:30] it'd be kind of hard to try to tell
[17:32] people that's
[17:33] been taught all of their life that
[17:35] they're righteous and and holy and don't
[17:37] need anything else and they are the
[17:39] people of god
[17:40] so you can see that jesus really did get
[17:42] into a lot of trouble with him
[17:44] as he began to try to tell him you must
[17:46] be born again
[17:48] nicodemus he calls him the teacher which
[17:51] would mean the greatest of all
[17:54] in the original translation he was the
[17:56] teacher of israel
[17:57] the greatest man of all you know the
[17:59] height of any knowledge you needed you
[18:01] would go to nicodemus
[18:04] and he said you must be born again and
[18:06] nicodemus said
[18:07] i don't understand you
[18:11] i've been born right i'm a jew i'm
[18:14] circumcised i've got everything right my
[18:16] lineage is perfect or i wouldn't be
[18:17] standing here and that's true
[18:20] that's right
[18:22] he wouldn't have been in the position he
[18:23] was if
[18:24] if his lineage just hadn't been right if
[18:26] everything hadn't been in place
[18:29] but yet when jesus said you must be born
[18:31] again the the only part he could go back
[18:34] to you mean i go i got to go back to my
[18:35] mother
[18:37] and i got to come again
[18:41] and jesus told him said if i tell you of
[18:43] these things here
[18:45] how in the world do you think you're
[18:46] going to understand heavenly things
[18:48] when you can't understand i'm not
[18:50] talking about i'm
[18:51] you're to know i got enough sense
[18:54] to not to think you can go back to mama
[18:56] and come out again
[18:58] because that wouldn't do nothing just
[18:59] make you twofold child of hell that
[19:00] wouldn't do you no good you'd be in
[19:02] double trouble all right
[19:04] but see
[19:05] when it come to the point then he
[19:07] couldn't comprehend
[19:11] now get the point and this will be all
[19:13] the way down through the messages to
[19:14] understand
[19:16] the problem with those pharisees
[19:18] was
[19:19] their old husband
[19:23] was not dead
[19:28] he said their old husband yeah
[19:32] but they had to log to the letter
[19:36] and would kill you for not believing the
[19:38] prophets
[19:40] right
[19:42] but yet
[19:44] their old husband was still alive
[19:49] now how could you tell people that how
[19:52] can you tell people today maybe that
[19:53] point
[19:55] when they think all of their life
[19:57] they've been in church they've been in
[19:58] this message a lot of you kids here was
[20:00] born and raised in the message as we
[20:02] call it
[20:04] and
[20:05] thinking that
[20:07] what do you mean we need to do this we
[20:09] need to do that
[20:12] in other words thinking you're saved
[20:14] just because you're in the message well
[20:16] did that make the children of israel
[20:17] saved
[20:18] because they were following
[20:22] the prophets
[20:25] the things
[20:27] they could tell you every word those
[20:29] prophets said it was even told that they
[20:32] could take a scroll and stick a pen
[20:33] through it and tell you what letters at
[20:35] that because they'd studied it so much
[20:38] but the letters that pen would go
[20:40] through
[20:42] you just think all of your life and
[20:43] nicodemus is probably an elderly
[20:45] gentleman
[20:48] and there he was
[20:49] he couldn't understand
[20:52] he just couldn't comprehend
[20:55] a new doctrine
[20:57] a new thought
[21:01] because he'd never thought about that
[21:05] but yet all the way through
[21:07] the old testament it was spoke of
[21:11] all the way through that it was spoke of
[21:13] that he would have to come and die for
[21:15] the sins of the people
[21:18] all the way through it was spoke of like
[21:22] who was it
[21:24] talking about that
[21:26] you know
[21:28] the spirit of god joy coming upon us
[21:32] now i'll give you my spirit
[21:35] and i'll put my spirit in you
[21:38] all of that was spoke of
[21:41] but yet the man that was supposed to
[21:43] understood
[21:46] was not capable of understanding it amen
[21:51] and he just couldn't see that he was
[21:52] lost
[21:56] right
[21:59] he couldn't see that this man is
[22:00] standing here now he says
[22:04] we know you're a man come from god
[22:07] he's because no man can do these things
[22:09] unless god be with him
[22:13] he wasn't arguing with jesus about the
[22:15] things
[22:18] see
[22:20] but he just couldn't understand
[22:24] why
[22:26] because they're in the garden what was
[22:28] it that it says i'll put enmity
[22:32] between thy seed
[22:33] and the seed of the woman you know
[22:35] genesis 3 15.
[22:39] see that enmity is the carnal mind paul
[22:42] explains
[22:45] and he said to be carnally minded is
[22:47] what
[22:49] death
[22:51] but to be spiritually minded as life
[22:56] so then
[22:57] those that were supposed to understood
[23:01] were the ones that crucified
[23:04] the savior
[23:07] now i wouldn't do anything like that now
[23:12] i'm just
[23:13] too blunt i guess
[23:17] but if we was back there we'd do the
[23:19] same thing they done under the same
[23:20] condition
[23:22] no i i love the lord jesus
[23:27] they loved his healings
[23:29] they loved his feeding you know
[23:32] right
[23:33] but they didn't love his doctrine
[23:36] because he come with a new doctrine
[23:39] a new thought
[23:41] that had never been
[23:43] you know that always was something
[23:44] flaring up you remember they was telling
[23:46] how that that many times someone would
[23:48] claim to be the christ and raise up and
[23:50] go out and you know and and do and
[23:56] but see here comes a man saying you must
[23:58] be born again
[24:03] well now
[24:05] but
[24:06] brother dale i've i've accepted jesus
[24:09] christ as my savior
[24:12] well now don't you believe that
[24:14] nicodemus kind of had a little bit of a
[24:17] an acceptance of christ i mean he put
[24:19] his life on the line he put his job on
[24:21] the line
[24:23] he did get to him
[24:26] and he wanted to listen
[24:29] but he just couldn't understand do we
[24:32] understand
[24:35] do we understand you must be born again
[24:38] do we even understand paul coming over
[24:40] there about it about acts 19 i guess
[24:43] where he says have you received the holy
[24:45] ghost since you believed
[24:47] he was talking to people in there you
[24:49] remember in the 18th chapter that
[24:51] apollos was proving that jesus was the
[24:53] christ
[24:55] and didn't even have the new birth
[24:59] come on read your bible paul said have
[25:01] you received the holy ghost since you
[25:02] believed
[25:04] he was a good believer
[25:06] he went through water baptism he went
[25:08] through sanctification and those things
[25:11] believing
[25:13] but he wasn't born again
[25:16] could we be that away
[25:20] see when we get down to talking about
[25:22] law and grace
[25:23] we're going to get down to to the carnal
[25:25] mind that much more
[25:29] because see the carnal mind is anything
[25:32] that we have contrary to the word of god
[25:37] and there's no way the carnal mind can
[25:38] have anything correct
[25:42] because satan won't let you
[25:45] explain language
[25:46] but see why then nicodemus
[25:49] you must be born again
[25:52] he said yeah but i'm in church i've done
[25:54] this all my life i've been here i'm
[25:55] circumcised i've been a jew i follow the
[25:57] laws i do everything
[26:01] but jesus said you must be born again
[26:05] see the original translation says you
[26:07] must be born
[26:08] from above
[26:12] in other words he was telling nicodemus
[26:14] you must be born from where i was born
[26:17] from
[26:19] right
[26:20] well i i remember mary
[26:24] yeah but you know there was a story told
[26:26] that
[26:27] mary was a virgin birth child
[26:31] no credit of joseph for anything else
[26:35] so
[26:36] he said you must be born from above
[26:42] we must be raised up and to be able to
[26:43] paul called it sit in heavenly places in
[26:46] christ jesus
[26:50] not what our carnal mind can conceive
[26:54] because in that carnal mind you're
[26:55] sitting there now trying to figure out
[26:57] what i'm talking about
[26:59] you're sitting there trying to figure
[27:00] out whether lunch is going to be ready
[27:02] or not
[27:03] you're trying to figure out well it's
[27:05] too hot the one next to you saying it's
[27:07] too cold
[27:09] one's fanning the others covering up
[27:11] with the sheets
[27:13] right
[27:15] see that's the carnal mind
[27:17] and that's death
[27:21] i would to god that i had in my head my
[27:25] my brain
[27:27] the thing that's been revealed in my
[27:29] heart
[27:30] he said well they're in your brain
[27:32] no there's a revelation inside of you
[27:35] that that brain can't comprehend
[27:39] all right with that in mind now this we
[27:41] won't lose the brothers or whatever what
[27:43] we're talking about
[27:47] see then
[27:49] you and i our problem
[27:51] was we were born in satan's domain
[27:55] right
[27:57] in the garden
[27:59] because of the fall in the garden it
[28:02] brought us into satan's domain
[28:05] lost
[28:06] and needing a savior
[28:10] abel
[28:12] needed a sacrifice just as well as cain
[28:16] made a sacrifice
[28:17] but you know cain made a sacrifice he
[28:20] made it he he was from his heart
[28:22] he got out and worked himself to death
[28:24] as we'd call it
[28:25] to get forth to bring fruit
[28:29] to try to
[28:33] do an offering do a sacrifice to a god
[28:36] that required one
[28:38] but able by faith in the blood
[28:44] see because he could see where he come
[28:45] from
[28:47] whereas cain couldn't follow it
[28:51] abel could see that he was born in his
[28:52] mother's blood you know from his
[28:54] father's blood and
[28:56] you could see that's where you come from
[29:00] and see once we're born you're born into
[29:02] satan's domain
[29:06] kin folks to the devil
[29:08] amen whether you like that or
[29:10] not what else you gonna call it
[29:14] we'll get into it this evening on the
[29:16] book of ruth
[29:18] you remember in the book of ruth
[29:21] boaz wasn't the nearest kin
[29:24] there was one near again
[29:28] boy has had to deal with that before he
[29:29] could redeem ruth
[29:31] or naomi to get roof
[29:34] see then we're born kin folks to the
[29:36] devil
[29:38] and i know you don't like it and i don't
[29:39] like to say it cause you know how i love
[29:40] little kids
[29:43] i mean everybody knows how i love little
[29:45] kids and little kids know how i love
[29:46] them
[29:48] but stealing that baby's born
[29:50] it's born in sin shaping and iniquity
[29:53] the spouse of his mother's wound a liar
[29:58] come on i'm quoting scripture is that
[29:59] what paul said i mean
[30:01] david and psalms said it
[30:04] solomon
[30:08] wonderful little baby there
[30:11] but yet it's a product
[30:17] see of not creation it's a product by an
[30:19] act that took place between mom and
[30:21] daddy
[30:22] amen
[30:23] and that puts us born in the domain of
[30:25] satan
[30:27] lost
[30:30] no matter how much you go to church what
[30:31] you do
[30:33] you're still lost until you're born
[30:34] again
[30:38] see then that domain that we're born in
[30:40] this out here
[30:41] this is not god's domain
[30:45] this is satan's domain
[30:50] he offered it to jesus didn't he
[30:53] right
[30:53] didn't he tell him he'd give him
[30:55] everything he showed him the kingdoms
[30:56] the bible said show devoted russia china
[30:59] united states and all the great glorious
[31:01] things
[31:05] he said i'll give them to you
[31:07] jesus never said it didn't belong to him
[31:10] he just said get behind me
[31:12] he even offered to give them to him
[31:18] right
[31:19] said you just fall down worse i'll give
[31:21] you a bit of this
[31:23] an opportunity to bypass death
[31:27] right because jesus was beginning by
[31:29] that time to realize he come to die
[31:33] that's the only way this thing could
[31:34] ever be straightened up was for almighty
[31:36] god himself not a second person or a
[31:39] third person of a trinity that wouldn't
[31:41] work because it ain't even in the bible
[31:44] but to know that he would have was
[31:46] coming to have to die
[31:48] to give his life that you and i could
[31:49] live
[31:54] you see then born in satan's domain
[32:00] that's why we have so much trouble
[32:04] that's why paul is we were bringing the
[32:05] other day and the romans so he said the
[32:07] things i would i do not the things i do
[32:09] i wouldn't in other words i don't want
[32:10] to do this but i do it
[32:15] and he said it's sin that dwelleth in
[32:16] this whole body
[32:20] but he never said he had to sin that's
[32:22] not what he taught
[32:25] he was just saying we're plain old human
[32:26] beings
[32:28] you know
[32:29] and by being human beings how good we
[32:31] think we are we're still a bunch of
[32:33] garbage cans
[32:37] that don't make no difference we're all
[32:39] that
[32:40] born that away
[32:41] all right
[32:42] now
[32:43] then in doing it we've got to be able to
[32:46] get out of that domain
[32:48] to get into
[32:51] the domain of god
[32:55] and see the new birth
[32:57] only deals with the soul of the
[32:58] individual
[33:01] that's why we have to cover the things
[33:03] later of the marriage and divorce the
[33:05] different things and in the scriptures
[33:06] part
[33:08] but the new birth only deals with that
[33:10] individual with the soul of that
[33:11] individual
[33:13] when you were born again the day you
[33:15] were born again it didn't change your
[33:16] body
[33:18] it just put with inside of
[33:22] you the new birth
[33:25] that would work back out to that spirit
[33:27] part of you or in memory reason
[33:29] conscience etc
[33:32] and bringing the body under subjection
[33:36] right
[33:38] but you know because i got born again
[33:40] didn't mean i quit eating
[33:44] but yet i show you the bible that says
[33:47] if you come and eat this bread you'll
[33:49] never want no more bread
[33:51] right
[33:53] if you enter into my rest you don't have
[33:54] to worry about resting you'll never have
[33:56] to go to sleep you don't never have to
[33:58] go to bed you're just all going to be so
[34:00] wonderful
[34:02] now that's not exactly the scriptural
[34:04] terminology right
[34:07] all that happened was was that soul of
[34:09] that individual
[34:12] by accepting jesus christ as their
[34:14] savior
[34:17] and him coming and living in us because
[34:18] that's the point
[34:20] we can accept him
[34:24] and that's what our people do they come
[34:25] to the altar they accept him as their
[34:27] savior you see thousands of conversions
[34:30] we call it millions of them around the
[34:33] world
[34:34] but it's like billy graham said
[34:37] that i have ten thousand come to an
[34:39] altar
[34:41] he said i go back a year later and i
[34:42] might not have ten or thirty or
[34:44] something
[34:48] well they put on record every one of
[34:49] them was born again
[34:52] they give you little cards and a lot of
[34:53] churches and things you know
[34:55] little pens and whatever
[34:58] but does that make you a christian
[35:04] the question i've always asked to you
[35:06] and i is one thing
[35:07] as the prophet of god said it one day
[35:09] like this
[35:10] he says has he accepted you
[35:18] then you'll see the bible wouldn't it
[35:20] all be saved right
[35:23] but everybody's not going to be saved
[35:27] and god by his foreknowledge knows who
[35:29] will and who won't
[35:33] he knew them people in acts 18
[35:35] that were firm believers in jesus christ
[35:39] under apollos even proving that jesus
[35:42] was the christ
[35:44] he knew there's something wrong with him
[35:47] so he let paul go by there
[35:52] and say have you received the holy ghost
[35:54] since you believe
[35:56] well i just believe
[35:58] so does the devil now where does that
[36:00] put him
[36:01] that's right
[36:03] as a matter of fact it says the devil
[36:04] believed in one god we were all
[36:06] believing in the trinity that we heard
[36:07] the truth right
[36:10] the bible says the devil believed in one
[36:12] god and trembled
[36:15] he's scared about that
[36:17] he's scared about you and i
[36:20] and we're coming to a knowledge of
[36:21] understanding
[36:24] that he ain't nothing but a bluff
[36:28] everybody's afraid of the devil why are
[36:30] you afraid of the devil i ain't afraid
[36:32] of the devil i'm afraid of you
[36:36] devil ain't gonna hurt me you
[36:39] that's right
[36:40] he can make you hurt me but he ain't
[36:42] gonna hurt me
[36:45] people scared as i tell you the other
[36:47] day don't tell your kids the booger
[36:48] man's out in the yard don't go out in
[36:50] the yard you're just scaring them four
[36:52] kids to death for nothing
[37:00] the devil's not out in the yard
[37:04] if he's out in the yard i'd be happy
[37:08] you know where he had on me right here
[37:11] beating me to death in my brain
[37:14] saying them people they don't want to
[37:15] hear what you're talking about shut up
[37:17] and go on
[37:19] but listen
[37:21] so then by understanding the the
[37:24] situation that made us lost
[37:29] then we can understand why we need to be
[37:30] saved
[37:33] all right
[37:35] see take it on up into
[37:37] if we don't understand why we need
[37:39] marriage and divorce to pre-preach then
[37:41] there's no need of preaching it
[37:44] and we take man's ideas and say well
[37:46] it's all right
[37:48] everything's all right and even people
[37:51] say and say well you know if you get the
[37:52] new birth everything's settled
[37:56] well
[38:00] if just getting the new birth settled
[38:01] everything then we need to rip out a lot
[38:03] of the bible and throw it away
[38:08] all right
[38:09] but you see what i want us to do is to
[38:11] take the message
[38:13] go through the new birth then go through
[38:16] the grace of imagining four then an
[38:18] attempt to understand
[38:20] law and grace
[38:26] because the law is not as i told you the
[38:28] other day law is not just ten
[38:29] commandments that's what we call it
[38:32] paul said the law is spiritual
[38:36] but i'm carnal he said
[38:38] sold under sin
[38:41] but then he turned around and said the
[38:43] thing i thought was life
[38:47] i found to be death
[38:50] right
[38:52] see he thought because he didn't break
[38:54] the law because he kept the law to the
[38:57] letter because he'd done everything it
[38:58] said do and everything it said not to do
[39:01] that he was righteous
[39:05] and you know what he wasn't guilty
[39:08] right
[39:09] he wasn't guilty of breaking it
[39:15] and if he wasn't guilty of breaking then
[39:16] why didn't he need to be born again
[39:19] there must be more to that
[39:21] so that's why we're going to break it
[39:22] down
[39:23] and understand it to try to understand
[39:25] and let's just read a few quotes that
[39:27] the prophet of god
[39:28] had to say to us to just line up what it
[39:30] was saying
[39:32] and taking it from the invisible union
[39:34] that's why i'm asking you to read that
[39:36] book over to hear that
[39:37] over and over and over
[39:40] because we're going to be using the same
[39:42] quotes
[39:43] to go higher and higher and higher and
[39:45] higher
[39:47] and you'll see what he was doing in that
[39:49] message
[39:53] to stand there and talk about an
[39:54] invisible union
[39:58] but at least you would even read the
[39:59] title
[40:02] to show you it's not just
[40:05] a new birth situation that he's speaking
[40:07] of
[40:10] the title of the message is the
[40:12] invisible union
[40:16] of the bride of christ
[40:25] see then that will tie together all
[40:27] threefold revelations to come out to be
[40:29] a beautiful picture
[40:32] this you and i becoming one together
[40:38] that's the invisible union that's why
[40:39] it's invisible
[40:41] see the world can't understand that
[40:45] but see we want to just take a message
[40:47] and just go do it but go like the future
[40:49] home
[40:50] where in the future home he covers a
[40:51] threefold revelation
[40:54] first of your soul
[40:57] then the bodily parts of us in the world
[40:59] even to be
[41:02] fully redeemed
[41:05] often the same scripture that he would
[41:07] read
[41:08] but he just takes the thought higher and
[41:10] higher and higher
[41:16] but just think about some of the things
[41:17] go ahead brother let's start with number
[41:19] one
[41:20] we'll go as far as we can and then we'll
[41:22] quit
[41:22] take up this evening
[41:24] these will all be basically if not i'll
[41:26] call it out
[41:27] but it'll be basically from the
[41:28] invisible union priest 1965 11 25
[41:33] in shreveport louisiana paragraph 206.
[41:37] life is a sacred thing to god and is
[41:39] recorded in a book
[41:41] and god is the author of life
[41:43] do you believe that everybody oh amen
[41:48] our natural life here we have is just a
[41:50] perversion
[41:52] it really should be the right life to
[41:54] begin with see if it hadn't been a fall
[41:56] in the garden it would have been the
[41:57] right life right
[41:59] now
[42:00] but it's perverted by the natural birth
[42:05] the first life of your first union you
[42:08] were joined at birth
[42:11] by nature a natural act
[42:16] so that's going to put everything we're
[42:17] in it's going to be natural
[42:21] because it's a natural act
[42:22] it was an act between mom and daddy that
[42:24] brought us forth right
[42:27] an act that god says okay it's fine to
[42:30] do that but it's wrong to start with
[42:34] we shouldn't have come that way
[42:36] we should have come by spoken word
[42:39] but instead eve got ahead of the plan
[42:42] right
[42:43] and brought us into a natural world
[42:45] satan's domain see a natural human being
[42:48] associated man and woman together
[42:51] associated together in sexual afire
[42:54] which brought your first life here and
[42:56] that's associated with sin and death
[42:59] how can you miss seeing the seed serpent
[43:02] seed
[43:03] no
[43:04] how can you miss seeing the serpent see
[43:06] how can you miss seeing what happened in
[43:08] the garden
[43:12] i know i'm carnal
[43:13] and i know i say things that are carnal
[43:16] but if you don't know what happened in
[43:18] the garden i'd suggest you go get you a
[43:20] playboy magazine and read it
[43:25] he said you shouldn't talk like that
[43:26] well why not
[43:28] they seem to know about about it and the
[43:30] preachers do
[43:33] preacher says we eat an apple
[43:36] well you've got your belly ache
[43:41] right
[43:43] and how come adam and eve would put on
[43:45] clothes
[43:46] why didn't they get them a
[43:48] handkerchief or something to wipe their
[43:50] hands with or throw the apples away
[43:55] see what church
[43:57] we're born natural
[44:00] by being born natural we're lost
[44:05] doomed and on our way to hell right
[44:08] go ahead to the next one
[44:10] paragraph 2 12.
[44:13] that was nature associated with death
[44:15] and watch him
[44:16] your first husband that had rule over
[44:18] you
[44:19] was your nature by natural birth
[44:23] now that's men and women see we can set
[44:25] men say that ain't me because i'm a man
[44:29] now remember
[44:32] where paul says in romans 7
[44:35] that the man is
[44:37] born bound by the law
[44:40] mankind
[44:42] which means woman and man right okay all
[44:45] right
[44:46] so now no matter who we are
[44:48] we had a first husband and that's our
[44:50] trouble
[44:53] that's our trouble we had a first
[44:54] husband
[44:57] all right
[45:00] your first husband had rolled over you
[45:02] was your nature by natural birth that's
[45:04] right
[45:07] naturally you love the world because you
[45:09] are the world and part of the world
[45:11] that's right congregation says amen
[45:13] your desires was by nature to love the
[45:15] world which you're a part of you're a
[45:18] part of nature
[45:19] you believe that amen and that's your
[45:21] natural things what
[45:24] that's the reason you have to be born
[45:27] again
[45:29] you have to be separate you have to
[45:30] separate you have to die to that first
[45:34] husband
[45:36] that's right so now each one of them
[45:38] each one of the threefold we're going to
[45:39] be dealing with is going to be dealing
[45:41] with the death of the old husband
[45:46] because
[45:48] he's got to die
[45:51] you can't live with it
[45:53] you just can't say well look i'll
[45:55] divorce him and hang him up out here in
[45:57] the
[45:58] uh up here till occasion
[46:01] that's what a lot of people say i
[46:03] i know i don't need to sin but i just
[46:06] can't help it
[46:08] right
[46:09] why because the old husband's still
[46:11] alive
[46:13] i mean if my wife run off with a man and
[46:15] then come back and told me well honey
[46:17] i'd forgive her but then she come back
[46:19] the next day and told me the same story
[46:21] while i'm gonna get where i'm gonna
[46:22] forgive her
[46:24] right
[46:25] because she's digging that old husband
[46:27] up
[46:30] right
[46:31] she's flirting around with something
[46:32] else all right now but that's the reason
[46:35] you have to be born again
[46:37] you got to die to that first husband
[46:40] you can't divorce him no sir no riding a
[46:44] divorcement he dies
[46:47] the nature of the world has to die every
[46:50] speck of him has to die you have to be
[46:53] reunited again
[46:55] with another nature
[46:57] now is that a simple way of explaining
[46:58] the new birth
[47:02] is that a simple way of explaining
[47:04] how that we must be born again
[47:09] now how could you have explained that to
[47:11] nicodemus
[47:13] right
[47:17] what do you mean
[47:20] my old husband
[47:22] i'll have you to know
[47:24] i am a circumcised israelite
[47:30] i've always believed since i come in
[47:31] this message and heard the prophet
[47:33] explain serpent seed
[47:35] i've always believed those
[47:37] pharisees and things knew about what
[47:39] happened in the garden
[47:40] because they told jesus said we weren't
[47:42] born like you
[47:45] right
[47:47] because they thought he was illegitimate
[47:48] born and to them an illegitimate born
[47:50] child was
[47:54] no good see couldn't come in the
[47:55] congregation for one or 400 years
[47:59] now
[48:00] i believe those pharisees believed that
[48:02] when they were circumcised that done
[48:04] away
[48:05] with this sin curse in the garden
[48:08] you may not believe that that's all
[48:09] right that's my thoughts what i've
[48:10] always believed
[48:12] why because they laid on that so much
[48:15] why did paul say a pharisee of the
[48:17] pharisees circumcised on the eighth day
[48:22] see they put all that confidence and
[48:23] that trust in that what they had read
[48:25] and believed that god gave abraham
[48:29] the sign of circumcision which it was it
[48:31] was a sign that would come later to be
[48:34] the baptism of the holy ghost to you and
[48:36] i because that's what it was speaking of
[48:38] that's what i said all of the things as
[48:40] we're talking a minute ago about
[48:41] nicodemus all the things that nicodemus
[48:44] knew
[48:47] of all of those things and what they
[48:48] would be speaking of
[48:50] but yet
[48:52] he couldn't comprehend
[48:58] he never thought he had an old husband
[48:59] it was wrong
[49:03] what about you and i
[49:07] there's a lot of people that never been
[49:08] married twice
[49:10] you know you know what i'm talking about
[49:11] naturally
[49:15] but how many times was he engaged
[49:19] you see the no well that engagement
[49:21] don't count you got to have a wedding
[49:22] you know you got no
[49:24] we've done been through that
[49:28] joseph fear not to take unto thee mary
[49:29] thy wife the bible said there was a
[49:31] spouse the bible calls it his wife
[49:36] all right
[49:38] but you see what i'm trying to get to
[49:42] watch what we was when the prophet talks
[49:45] about she
[49:46] through the invisible union he's talking
[49:48] about the people right men women and all
[49:51] the people all right go to the next one
[49:54] go to number two
[49:58] paragraph 134
[50:00] going to 135.
[50:03] she was born or married connected with
[50:05] her first husband
[50:07] the first adam
[50:13] what
[50:15] by the adulterous wife
[50:17] of eve
[50:19] because the bible says and adam all die
[50:22] eve was the problem but adam by taking
[50:25] eve
[50:27] took her sin and throwed us into sin
[50:31] by taking her to himself
[50:34] if he just said no get out of here
[50:39] but he didn't sure he loved her
[50:41] that's fine
[50:42] you know what i'm glad he did because we
[50:44] probably wouldn't be here
[50:48] i'm sure glad that them jews didn't
[50:50] accept jesus christ when he came
[50:53] aren't you
[50:55] well you know we wouldn't be here
[50:58] let's see the whole story's got to be
[50:59] fulfilled but once
[51:02] she was born and married connected with
[51:04] her first husband the first adam my
[51:06] adulterous wife of eve adam's first wife
[51:09] you say adulterous she sure was but all
[51:12] she claims that this adam
[51:15] this first adam is dead
[51:18] oh sure he died a long time ago
[51:22] i'm born again
[51:26] she said
[51:27] and i'm certainly married to the second
[51:30] adam christ the word
[51:33] now is that what everybody says
[51:35] you talk to them about the new birth
[51:39] i'm married
[51:40] to the second adam
[51:42] my old husband is dead
[51:45] the bible speaks of the first adam and
[51:47] the second adam right
[51:49] first adam was made a
[51:50] living being the second adam was a
[51:52] quickening spirit
[51:56] but you see what he's saying about her
[51:58] old husband
[52:04] that old husband that we have is our
[52:06] natural nature
[52:13] that's why we act like we do
[52:16] that's our nature that's our ways that's
[52:18] our husband
[52:24] all right
[52:25] but see then we've got to be born again
[52:27] and to do that
[52:29] that first husband's got to die
[52:31] that's what nicodemus could've never
[52:33] caught on to
[52:36] he said if i can't explain these things
[52:38] to you i talked to you about you need to
[52:39] die
[52:40] wouldn't that been something to infer it
[52:41] to nicodemus
[52:44] he then told him he must be born again
[52:45] he couldn't comprehend that what if
[52:46] jesus said you must die
[52:49] yeah
[52:51] plow you know did that help anything
[52:57] but that's what he was explaining
[53:03] you and i no matter who we are
[53:06] we were born
[53:08] in sin
[53:10] shapen in iniquity
[53:12] and a spouse from our mother's wound a
[53:14] liar
[53:16] right
[53:17] you get these little kids oh they're
[53:18] wonderful you know i love them
[53:20] but you take a two-year-old kid
[53:23] you know he's standing there he got
[53:25] cookie all over his face it's just
[53:26] running everywhere he got cooking in his
[53:28] hand and you say did you get that cookie
[53:33] you got no cookie
[53:34] you got a cookie you got cookie all over
[53:36] him
[53:37] who taught him to lie
[53:41] mama don't lie daddy don't lie
[53:43] who taught him how to lie
[53:48] the nature is born under
[53:51] we try to lie out of everything don't we
[53:54] that's the easy thing to do and
[53:58] then we do like who was it reagan
[54:01] he said i can't remember
[54:04] see then we blame it on old age you know
[54:07] i can't remember
[54:09] ain't much you can do with a guy
[54:11] if he said well i might have done it but
[54:13] i don't remember you know how could that
[54:15] person you know prosecuted him
[54:17] but now listen
[54:20] there's got to be a spiritual death
[54:24] physically die won't take us to heaven
[54:26] right
[54:28] see but there's got to be a spiritual
[54:30] death in other words it got to be a
[54:31] death to you
[54:34] your nature and your ways
[54:38] all right even though the bible says
[54:40] ezekiel 18 4 i think it is that all
[54:42] souls are mine
[54:45] and when god created
[54:47] that baby
[54:48] now
[54:50] that baby was created perfect
[54:53] now listen to the wording not eternal
[54:58] right
[54:59] perfect
[55:01] all right the body it used to be but not
[55:04] always deteriorating used to be a
[55:06] natural baby had such a
[55:08] immune system built into it in 40 years
[55:10] ago until it was almost virtually immune
[55:13] from sickness for
[55:15] six months or something because it had
[55:16] that
[55:18] was built into the human body
[55:20] so when god created that he created it
[55:22] perfect
[55:25] he gave you a perfect spirit nothing
[55:27] wrong with it
[55:29] he gave you a perfect soul
[55:33] he couldn't give you a soul that was was
[55:36] the devil the devil can't give you one
[55:39] he can't create
[55:43] and see god couldn't give you a dirty
[55:45] soul
[55:46] where'd he get it from
[55:49] so he made you perfect
[55:52] see
[55:53] god never put us in the pawn shop as we
[55:55] call it
[55:58] the devil starts on that little child as
[56:00] quick as he's born in the hospital room
[56:02] and little fella don't even know nothing
[56:04] but looks up and there's the nurses and
[56:06] the doctors cussing and raising cane
[56:08] the poor little thing starts off in life
[56:13] but don't worry about it if you took it
[56:14] and put it in the perfect beautiful and
[56:16] nobody never said a word wrong the
[56:18] little kid's still winding up be a liar
[56:23] why because that's the way he's born
[56:28] we blame the kids or to blame the
[56:30] parents for a lot of it but still we're
[56:32] born in sin
[56:35] we come into the world a liar
[56:38] that's our old husband you understand
[56:40] what i'm trying to make
[56:42] that baby is born with a husband
[56:46] that is the nature
[56:48] or ways
[56:50] of the old adamic nature of us as we
[56:52] call it
[56:55] that the best we can do
[56:58] would be nothing in the sight of god
[57:02] the holiest we could live what does the
[57:03] bible call it about your
[57:05] self-righteousness
[57:08] our righteousness is filthy rags the
[57:10] bible says the best we could do i've
[57:13] never done that
[57:14] so i can stand here and say i never
[57:16] drank
[57:19] i can i can say that because i didn't do
[57:21] it
[57:22] but does that make me more righteous
[57:24] than you that slopped into gutters with
[57:26] it no
[57:33] the one that has done more is easier to
[57:35] forgive a lot of time
[57:38] all right
[57:39] but now listen
[57:41] you she was born or married
[57:45] did you read that one go back over that
[57:46] number two because you're gonna hold
[57:47] these words as we go through
[57:50] and then we're gonna take these words
[57:51] married and we're gonna move them up in
[57:52] another step come back to number two
[57:58] see
[58:01] she was born or married
[58:04] what does married mean
[58:07] joined
[58:09] together
[58:12] right
[58:14] and you and i joined
[58:16] in my wife we got married we were joined
[58:18] as one
[58:20] right
[58:21] but see in your natural nature when he
[58:23] was born
[58:25] he was born ken folks to the devil
[58:29] he was born in his domain
[58:34] nothing righteous about us if it was
[58:35] jesus christ died in vain
[58:40] was he married
[58:42] connected with your first husband
[58:47] now you see why marriage and divorce
[58:49] will go right on and true then as you're
[58:51] picking it up
[58:54] that old husband
[58:56] has got to be dead
[58:59] she claims we were reading there
[59:02] i'm born again
[59:05] my old husband is dead
[59:09] now do you need the quotes that goes on
[59:11] down through
[59:12] or have you read the message or listen
[59:14] to the tapes
[59:18] he says you say you're born again
[59:20] and yet you're going out living
[59:25] and he said cutting your hair and
[59:26] painting your face
[59:30] living in adultery and
[59:33] drinking corrosion everything
[59:36] and you say you're christians
[59:42] now
[59:45] whether you like it or not i didn't have
[59:46] that understanding of christianity
[59:48] before i heard of this message
[59:52] i don't think some of you had that
[59:54] understanding did you
[59:56] i mean sister gail did you think because
[59:58] you was born again you could go out and
[59:59] live like the devil
[1:00:01] no you you maybe didn't know a lot of it
[1:00:03] was the devil but you still didn't
[1:00:07] right
[1:00:08] why because we used to be there used to
[1:00:10] be good people in the world
[1:00:14] that by their new birth it did do
[1:00:16] something for them
[1:00:19] it made them live right
[1:00:24] i didn't have to come into this message
[1:00:26] of the hour to learn it was wrong to
[1:00:27] drink or commit adultery or
[1:00:30] smoke or gamble or something i didn't
[1:00:32] have to learn that after i come in the
[1:00:33] message
[1:00:37] i thought the new birth was supposed to
[1:00:39] take care of that nature
[1:00:46] well see the way most people are they
[1:00:47] come like well
[1:00:49] well i i know i drank corrals and run
[1:00:51] around adultery and everything but i
[1:00:53] didn't know that was wrong but i was a
[1:00:55] born-again christian
[1:01:00] well
[1:01:01] i'm sorry to bust your little bubble i
[1:01:03] don't think he was
[1:01:08] because god don't live like that
[1:01:11] now small things that you didn't
[1:01:13] understand yes
[1:01:16] because it wasn't preached by the
[1:01:18] preachers that it was wrong to cut your
[1:01:20] hair paint your face or do something and
[1:01:22] you went on doing those things
[1:01:24] but then when you first heard about it
[1:01:26] what happened
[1:01:32] come on any more women
[1:01:34] my mama and them they wouldn't
[1:01:38] they wouldn't cut their hair
[1:01:40] and even those that did start cutting
[1:01:42] their hair later on
[1:01:43] they'd put a hat on when they went to
[1:01:45] church
[1:01:46] you remember
[1:01:48] because they believed they needed a
[1:01:49] covering
[1:01:51] and somebody told them a hat was a
[1:01:53] covering
[1:01:57] lying preachers right
[1:01:59] but get on with it now
[1:02:02] see your first nature
[1:02:05] he was born
[1:02:07] you know it was put in the book of life
[1:02:10] it's called the bible
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:15] and it's there to face us
[1:02:19] my name's not written in there
[1:02:22] no
[1:02:23] but your nature is
[1:02:26] right
[1:02:26] the bible tells you what nature we're
[1:02:28] supposed to have
[1:02:31] that's what he was trying to tell
[1:02:32] nicodemus what about telling the man
[1:02:34] that never done never did never thought
[1:02:35] about because he he just kept himself
[1:02:37] locked in
[1:02:41] and yet you're trying to tell him he's
[1:02:42] lost
[1:02:48] you see why it's so hard to try to
[1:02:49] preach to people in this message
[1:02:54] because they all think i know i'm born
[1:02:56] again because i've come into the message
[1:03:00] i approved it
[1:03:03] well have you received the holy ghost
[1:03:05] since you come in the message
[1:03:10] but that don't go over good
[1:03:14] well see we've got to have something to
[1:03:15] happen
[1:03:16] going down to number three we're
[1:03:17] bypassed too hey
[1:03:21] let's read what the prophet said about
[1:03:23] this must happen to you and i
[1:03:25] progress 216.
[1:03:27] you see when you were separated from
[1:03:28] that union by spiritual death now your
[1:03:31] union was your old nature they damnit
[1:03:33] the old husband the new birth
[1:03:37] is a spiritual death
[1:03:40] right
[1:03:41] right
[1:03:42] okay your natural desire is to cut your
[1:03:46] hair that's natural you're born that way
[1:03:49] your natural desire to wear shorts paint
[1:03:51] your face your natural desire to be is
[1:03:53] to be intellectual
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:56] smart man know something better than the
[1:03:59] other
[1:04:00] ain't that in the message
[1:04:02] i got this first
[1:04:05] i was the first one to taught on this
[1:04:08] okay
[1:04:09] yeah
[1:04:10] that's what he wanted he said
[1:04:15] intellectual
[1:04:17] and doing it
[1:04:18] but you see there's got to be a
[1:04:19] spiritual death
[1:04:22] that's why you must be born again
[1:04:26] and to do that means you've got to die
[1:04:31] or why would it be talking about born
[1:04:32] again
[1:04:33] you know
[1:04:34] you got to die
[1:04:36] you got to die to your thinking
[1:04:39] you've got to let the holy ghost come in
[1:04:41] and
[1:04:42] cleanse out that sin and repent
[1:04:46] and we call it justification
[1:04:50] which means that you repent of what
[1:04:51] you've done chops off your sins and does
[1:04:54] nothing to the rest of you
[1:04:57] then you start dealing with
[1:04:58] sanctification
[1:05:00] that's why we believe firmly in what was
[1:05:02] taught down through the ages i believe
[1:05:04] what luther taught of justification the
[1:05:06] truth of it
[1:05:09] i do i believe that just shall live by
[1:05:11] faith
[1:05:13] i believe john wesley when he come
[1:05:14] forward preaching sanctification
[1:05:17] i believe in that
[1:05:19] why because i've experienced it
[1:05:22] i believe in a cleansing and setting
[1:05:24] aside of that vessel that's with inside
[1:05:27] of me called the soul amen
[1:05:32] we see there's where the trouble's at
[1:05:36] because at that stage of sanctification
[1:05:39] you get these new desires and your
[1:05:40] thoughts you want to go to church you
[1:05:42] want to do right you quit cutting your
[1:05:43] hair you quit painting your face you
[1:05:44] quit doing these things
[1:05:47] you think you're
[1:05:48] saved
[1:05:50] that's a dangerous stage
[1:05:58] because see
[1:06:00] all you've done is what jesus said
[1:06:03] when you're sanctified that's what he
[1:06:04] was preaching
[1:06:06] he said the unclean spirit goeth out of
[1:06:07] a man
[1:06:09] seeketh rest and findeth none come back
[1:06:11] and finds the house swept and garnished
[1:06:14] entered back into the house
[1:06:16] and the state of the man is seven times
[1:06:18] worse
[1:06:22] right
[1:06:23] and you know what the prophet said one
[1:06:25] day about that
[1:06:26] he said religious demons come
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:33] religious preachers gets up in the
[1:06:35] pulpit
[1:06:38] and they talk about how that will you
[1:06:40] come into the message that no that means
[1:06:42] that you've got to be born again
[1:06:45] well the devil did so he beat us there
[1:06:53] i said brother you just need to preach
[1:06:54] sweet and soft stuff to us and get us
[1:06:56] born again
[1:06:58] can't get you born again you realize you
[1:06:59] lost
[1:07:03] when you realize you're lost you'll do
[1:07:05] something about it
[1:07:07] you go on your life thinking you saved
[1:07:09] and wind up at the end find out you're
[1:07:10] lost
[1:07:12] well yes you went to church you've done
[1:07:13] everything
[1:07:15] look at the apostle paul all of his life
[1:07:17] he had spent in that church
[1:07:20] right
[1:07:22] probably on up in his age by the time he
[1:07:23] got converted nobody
[1:07:26] knows i know he wasn't 18 because he
[1:07:29] wouldn't
[1:07:33] but yet he said what i thought was life
[1:07:36] i found to be death
[1:07:40] he said then i died
[1:07:43] that christ may become alive in me
[1:07:46] in the life that i now live in the flesh
[1:07:49] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:07:53] see he went through a conversion
[1:07:59] he went through a death to paul
[1:08:02] paul seen that old husband died
[1:08:05] when he wrote it in romans
[1:08:11] he said it was dead
[1:08:14] anything dead ought to be buried
[1:08:17] you know
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:22] but you see church
[1:08:25] you're going to have a spiritual death
[1:08:29] a death just to that soul
[1:08:33] you know
[1:08:34] a dying to yourself and your ideas
[1:08:37] a cleansing comes and jesus said drives
[1:08:39] that unclean spirit out
[1:08:42] but then the holy spirit's got to come
[1:08:44] in
[1:08:46] that's why joel said
[1:08:47] i give you a new heart
[1:08:51] and a new spirit
[1:08:54] or ezekiel let's get the right one on it
[1:08:57] i'll give you a new heart a new spirit
[1:09:01] he said then i put my spirit in you
[1:09:04] see the new heart and the new spirits
[1:09:06] you can't stand yourself with your old
[1:09:07] spirit that's right
[1:09:09] the only way you can get along with
[1:09:11] anybody is for them agree with you you
[1:09:12] know better than that
[1:09:16] they could agree and we don't get along
[1:09:17] with them
[1:09:18] you can't even agree with your own self
[1:09:20] the old ways
[1:09:23] but see then things changes
[1:09:26] and he give you a new spirit
[1:09:29] he sanctified you cleanse you
[1:09:33] makes you want to go to church make you
[1:09:34] want to live right and do right and that
[1:09:36] right
[1:09:39] you know it always amazed me that the
[1:09:40] women of the united states and the
[1:09:42] things like the prophet would say
[1:09:45] he said you preach to them all you can
[1:09:47] you go back the next year and they're
[1:09:48] getting worse and worse
[1:09:50] but he said go to africa and preach one
[1:09:52] message and said they get born again and
[1:09:54] said there's blanket natives nothing but
[1:09:57] a little small cloth down at the bottom
[1:09:59] nothing up at the top and said they
[1:10:01] accept jesus christ and he said they
[1:10:03] immediately fold their arms and get up
[1:10:05] and walk out
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:07] and said when they come back they got on
[1:10:09] clothes
[1:10:14] but yet we think it's better to take
[1:10:15] them off
[1:10:17] right
[1:10:22] but church listen
[1:10:24] if that new life don't come in what good
[1:10:26] is the vessel
[1:10:29] and you'll see why
[1:10:31] that if now what i was saying a while
[1:10:32] ago
[1:10:33] you accept him as your savior
[1:10:37] that's wonderful
[1:10:39] but has he ever accepted you
[1:10:43] see he accepted abraham's believing
[1:10:46] right
[1:10:47] and he gave him this sign of
[1:10:49] circumcision is that scripture now
[1:10:52] he done something for abraham
[1:10:54] right
[1:10:56] all right now has he circumcised us
[1:10:59] you know our hearts and our lives
[1:11:02] that new birth coming in
[1:11:05] like he covers in the future home he
[1:11:07] said it'll burn out every telltale sign
[1:11:10] of satan that's in that soul
[1:11:16] burn it out
[1:11:18] die to yourself
[1:11:21] but that's why most people don't get it
[1:11:23] see they won't never come to the place
[1:11:24] they'll come to sanctification
[1:11:27] and they go to church and they want to
[1:11:28] do good and they become preachers and
[1:11:30] they become great deacons and and
[1:11:32] everything come
[1:11:36] why didn't god accept them
[1:11:41] are you with me
[1:11:43] you accepting him is one thing but why
[1:11:45] is it god don't accept people
[1:11:50] there's got to be something wrong
[1:11:52] if he accepted you
[1:11:54] right
[1:11:56] come on he accepted you why didn't he
[1:11:57] accept everybody else
[1:12:00] there was something wrong the way they
[1:12:02] were believing
[1:12:03] and a lot of times the way you're
[1:12:05] believing is what you've been taught
[1:12:09] so that's why you see me hollering about
[1:12:10] that the preachers preach will you come
[1:12:12] into the message that proves you got the
[1:12:14] holy ghost
[1:12:15] i told a man one time i said i used to
[1:12:17] read six books a day and listen to two
[1:12:19] tapes but i said i'd done that when i
[1:12:21] wasn't even born again he said what do
[1:12:23] you mean
[1:12:25] i said i mean i've lost
[1:12:29] i mean i wasn't born again
[1:12:32] yet i was a deacon at 23 years of age so
[1:12:34] you know the life had to be there
[1:12:39] but yeah it's two years in this message
[1:12:41] before i receive the baptism of the holy
[1:12:42] ghost
[1:12:46] we don't all have to be like you i agree
[1:12:48] with you all of you ain't as dumb as i
[1:12:50] am
[1:12:51] no problems with that
[1:12:56] but there's one thing about this old boy
[1:12:57] that all of you know
[1:12:59] when i get a hold i get a hold
[1:13:02] and you don't have to worry about it
[1:13:05] you don't see me all these doctrines and
[1:13:07] ideas that's floating around the message
[1:13:09] why because something got a hold of me
[1:13:14] but you see you accept jesus christ but
[1:13:16] has he accepted you
[1:13:22] come on you go to the altar you repent
[1:13:25] you get converted you get sanctified
[1:13:28] then the preacher tells you you're okay
[1:13:30] you're a good christian
[1:13:33] and you listen to that it stops god from
[1:13:34] ever making any any more dealings with
[1:13:37] you about giving it to you
[1:13:38] see
[1:13:40] a pardon not a pardon unless received as
[1:13:42] a pardon but you've got to receive it
[1:13:44] but then the pardon's got to be from
[1:13:46] somebody else
[1:13:49] it ain't your pardon
[1:13:52] you got to receive it but if he don't
[1:13:55] give it
[1:13:57] and remember they shot the man
[1:14:02] that that story is about
[1:14:04] why
[1:14:06] because he didn't take the pardon
[1:14:11] are you with me
[1:14:14] but you see church what the prophet is
[1:14:16] trying to get at we must be separated
[1:14:17] let's get one more then we're going to
[1:14:19] have to quit we'll take this up this
[1:14:20] evening look at number four this is
[1:14:22] paragraph
[1:14:24] 222.
[1:14:27] i'm just rolling on that brother
[1:14:30] well you separated from your first union
[1:14:33] by spiritual death
[1:14:37] now you are are born again
[1:14:40] are remarried again
[1:14:46] now
[1:14:48] to the new spiritual union
[1:14:52] and he's explaining the new birth
[1:14:55] right
[1:14:58] of not your natural life for the things
[1:15:00] of the world
[1:15:01] but of eternal life
[1:15:03] that germ that was in you at the
[1:15:05] beginning
[1:15:06] found you
[1:15:10] that representation of predestination
[1:15:13] not something stamped inside of you know
[1:15:18] your representation of predestination
[1:15:20] that god knew you'd want to be saved
[1:15:25] oh but i was born with this gene in me
[1:15:28] you know then the message they teach
[1:15:30] that you don't even need to be born
[1:15:31] again because you was born eternal
[1:15:34] how many doctrines you want on that
[1:15:38] i don't say something i can't back up
[1:15:42] i've heard these or i wouldn't tell you
[1:15:43] that
[1:15:46] he was born with this gene in you i come
[1:15:48] into the world eternal life well what
[1:15:50] did jesus christ die for
[1:15:54] come on that is your old husband that's
[1:15:57] still alive
[1:15:58] that's that guy that needs to be killed
[1:16:03] that's that guy you need to die to
[1:16:07] we need a spiritual birth
[1:16:09] to do that we got to have a spiritual
[1:16:11] death
[1:16:13] and die out to ourselves
[1:16:17] and let jesus christ come in and you
[1:16:20] know he don't always come in all at once
[1:16:22] does he brother gary
[1:16:24] the brother gary talked to him about it
[1:16:26] because he was about a year in seeking
[1:16:28] god
[1:16:30] well i got it well i just got it when i
[1:16:32] believed
[1:16:35] well what'd you believe
[1:16:38] if you were the good old baptist and got
[1:16:40] it when you believed you just believe in
[1:16:41] the trinity
[1:16:43] oh oh
[1:16:45] now we got into something didn't we
[1:16:49] good believing god was three but yet you
[1:16:51] got saved
[1:16:52] i'm not going to tell you you didn't
[1:16:56] i'm going to tell you the nature
[1:16:58] now will prove whether or not it's right
[1:17:03] i'm going to say this
[1:17:05] because i've said it for many years
[1:17:08] i'm going to say it in a way that's hard
[1:17:10] and stern
[1:17:13] a lot of you know the marital situations
[1:17:15] you're sitting in
[1:17:21] and i've even said that if you keep that
[1:17:23] natural situation as a problem
[1:17:25] you're not going to be there for the
[1:17:27] change of the body i didn't say and i
[1:17:28] never have taught you wouldn't go in the
[1:17:30] rapture in the bride now you know that
[1:17:32] so don't go off and say anything
[1:17:36] but that bride that stands there and
[1:17:37] changed in a moment of twinkling of an
[1:17:38] eye she's going to be pure
[1:17:40] and all of them old husbands is going to
[1:17:42] be dead but if that makes you mad
[1:17:46] if that upsets you to say that you think
[1:17:48] brother dale has said i've got to die i
[1:17:51] can't be changed then there's something
[1:17:52] wrong with you
[1:17:56] it's not wrong with what i'm saying
[1:17:58] because i said it right
[1:18:00] i've always said it right
[1:18:04] you seek god
[1:18:06] for a revelation
[1:18:08] of whether or not you're free
[1:18:13] if you get upset with me to say brother
[1:18:15] dale's throwing off on me and you leave
[1:18:17] you're leaving on your own blood that's
[1:18:18] not me it's free of me
[1:18:22] because i have never drove nobody to
[1:18:24] hell about a marital situation
[1:18:30] we're going to go by the grave because
[1:18:32] of our own natural carnality of our
[1:18:34] minds
[1:18:36] until somebody sees this word correctly
[1:18:39] and then they're going to stand on it
[1:18:40] and say death you're annihilated my old
[1:18:42] husband is gone i'm free from marriage
[1:18:45] and divorce i'm free from the new birth
[1:18:47] i'm in the new birth i'm free from the
[1:18:49] law and grace
[1:18:53] if you think i'm throwing off on you
[1:18:56] you better remember what i told you one
[1:18:58] time
[1:19:00] this man was allowed what time
[1:19:03] to walk back in my body
[1:19:06] and look out of my eyeballs
[1:19:09] and see you
[1:19:11] the way god saw you
[1:19:18] i don't back up
[1:19:21] but i'm not responsible if you won't
[1:19:23] take what's said to you
[1:19:27] if you won't do nothing about it then
[1:19:28] there is no hopes
[1:19:30] there is no hopes of being saved if you
[1:19:32] won't do anything about it
[1:19:35] you can shout glory hallelujah how
[1:19:36] religious i am and all of that now i
[1:19:38] believe the message you can do every bit
[1:19:40] of that
[1:19:41] and still be lost
[1:19:45] you've got to be born again
[1:19:47] if you've got the new birth i ain't
[1:19:49] worried about the body
[1:19:51] there'll be things made right
[1:19:54] somewhere
[1:19:56] i've never t nobody to hell
[1:19:58] marriage and divorce is not black it's
[1:20:00] not to blaspheme the holy ghost but to
[1:20:03] turn down the word when the word is
[1:20:05] brought to you is blaspheming the holy
[1:20:07] ghost
[1:20:08] because you're attributing the works of
[1:20:09] god to the devil you're saying that
[1:20:11] person is not saying what i believe
[1:20:14] you can seal your own doom by your
[1:20:16] thoughts
[1:20:19] i'm not against nobody i love everybody
[1:20:20] and i want everybody to be there
[1:20:22] but i gotta tell it like it is whether
[1:20:24] it's my family my kids my grandkids my
[1:20:27] whatever
[1:20:29] i've got to preach it like it is because
[1:20:32] that way it's on me if i don't
[1:20:35] and you know i don't take no stands no
[1:20:37] other way
[1:20:40] come on musicians
[1:20:43] but have you received the holy ghost
[1:20:44] since you believed
[1:20:49] i'm a believer wonderful
[1:20:51] but has god accepted you
[1:20:55] if he has then he gave you the sign of
[1:20:57] circumcision the new birth
[1:21:00] and if he gave you the new birth come on
[1:21:03] listen folks why don't you get it right
[1:21:05] the new birth to receive the new birth
[1:21:07] don't set everything automatically free
[1:21:09] why do you need the statue of a perfect
[1:21:11] man
[1:21:12] you mean you were born up here or was
[1:21:14] you born down here which which one one
[1:21:16] is it according to peter you was born
[1:21:17] again at faith
[1:21:19] according to the prophet she was born
[1:21:20] again at faith
[1:21:23] we weren't born with everything in us
[1:21:27] that's why we're being peter says
[1:21:30] born again by what by the incorruptible
[1:21:33] word of god
[1:21:36] and only by the way we hear it
[1:21:38] and how can we hear without a preacher
[1:21:40] and how can he preach unless he be sent
[1:21:45] right
[1:21:46] so what are we go ahead brother let's
[1:21:48] stand anybody have a need we just got
[1:21:50] three minutes till 12 and then we'll
[1:21:52] quit
[1:21:54] you have a need come and let's think
[1:21:55] about it talk about it pray about it
