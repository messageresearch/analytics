[2:59] turn around shake somebody's hand and
[3:01] you have just seen god
[3:06] good to have you out here tonight
[3:14] all this global warming that's going on
[3:16] around here
[3:18] we'll uh
[3:21] have to revisit that i think
[3:26] i think the almanac said we were
[3:28] supposed to have a warm winter i think
[3:29] they got the mcdonald's almanac from
[3:31] down in jamaica
[3:33] when they figured that one out because
[3:35] they're calling for up to an inch or
[3:37] more snow here tonight so we're gonna
[3:39] try to get finished a little early and i
[3:40] did not promise eight o'clock
[3:44] i don't know where he when he gets older
[3:46] he starts
[3:48] hearing voices or something i don't know
[3:50] but if you have your bible turn to the
[3:52] book of matthew 17
[3:56] we will uh
[3:58] kind of continue a thought from what we
[3:59] were
[4:00] what we're doing in sunday school class
[4:02] but uh
[4:04] i just realized
[4:06] uh
[4:08] yesterday that uh
[4:11] we're being watched
[4:13] so brother
[4:15] joseph just gave us a uh update on who's
[4:19] watching the uh videos
[4:21] that's going out of here
[4:23] downstairs too so brother donny and
[4:25] brother joe
[4:26] just
[4:27] you're being watched
[4:29] joyce you're being watched
[4:31] we were watching her last night and
[4:32] brother dick was doing something she was
[4:34] sitting away she took her arm and run it
[4:35] down
[4:39] so i think 175 people saw that
[4:43] so
[4:45] watch what you're doing
[4:47] we're being watched but no in all
[4:49] honesty uh we've had over 28 000 hits
[4:54] just on the video
[4:57] and we went through and looked at some
[4:58] last night and i had not really looked
[5:00] on it before brother joe sent me an
[5:01] email yesterday morning and said we're
[5:03] being watched
[5:05] so we thank god for that
[5:07] um
[5:08] we don't try to uh
[5:10] we're not a ministry to the world but i
[5:13] do believe we got a ministry that maybe
[5:15] is a little different than most
[5:17] that uh and we'll try tonight maybe to
[5:19] uh
[5:21] to show some of that and
[5:23] in what we're speaking on it'll be on
[5:26] the same line of the
[5:27] son of god and son of man
[5:30] but we're going to speak tonight on
[5:32] risen again
[5:34] because he said here in matthew of what
[5:36] he
[5:37] what he's saying here risen again from
[5:39] the dead
[5:40] because i believe that
[5:42] that we're in the end time
[5:44] we're in the son of man revelation but
[5:46] that does not mean
[5:48] that you got it
[5:50] there was millions of people in jesus
[5:53] day the day that the son of man one man
[5:56] the son of man walked on the earth in
[5:58] human flesh and brother brown said they
[6:00] didn't 100 people know who he was
[6:03] that's the same thing that's going on
[6:04] now and that was
[6:07] to the most religious people in the
[6:09] world that he came to but matthew 17
[6:12] verse
[6:13] nine and let's bow our heads truly
[6:15] remember uh brother claude he called
[6:16] last night brother jess is not doing
[6:18] well his blood pressure went from to 60
[6:20] over 40
[6:22] and that's not good
[6:24] and his mother's in the hospital when
[6:25] you moan you heard that but just uh
[6:28] um
[6:29] bless his heart he called me last night
[6:31] and he said i just wanted to hear a
[6:32] pleasant voice he said it's hard out
[6:34] here they're getting eight inches of
[6:35] snow today so that's not gonna help
[6:38] either so
[6:40] you get uh
[6:41] cabin fever like they always say when
[6:43] you get shut in like that and they've
[6:45] been they've been shut in so let's just
[6:46] keep them in our prayers and in our
[6:48] hearts dear heavenly father we pray
[6:49] tonight that you will come among us lord
[6:51] just one more time
[6:54] that you would speak the words father as

[7:00] whether you can live lord through this
[7:02] person and speak to the people father
[7:05] that we would all die out to ourself and
[7:07] our feelings and our ideas and our
[7:09] doctrines and our little petty feelings

[7:14] will lay all that aside lord and not
[7:16] worry about trying to get home lord or
[7:17] not worrying about

[7:59] you quicken it to our hearts father in
[8:01] jesus name we pray
[8:02] amen
[8:04] matthew 17 verse nine you've got the uh
[8:08] the jest of what's going on here it's
[8:09] the
[8:11] after six days jesus took peter and
[8:13] james and john on the mountain and he
[8:14] was transfigured
[8:16] and there was moses and elijah was there
[8:19] with him
[8:20] and then as they come down off the
[8:21] mountain in verse nine it says as they
[8:24] came down from the mountain jesus
[8:25] charged him saying
[8:27] tell the vision
[8:29] to no man until the son of man be risen
[8:32] again
[8:34] from
[8:35] the dead
[8:36] and his disciples ask him saying why
[8:38] then say the scribes that elias must
[8:40] first come see they even know now
[8:42] brother gary that elijah's supposed to
[8:44] show up before this coming of this of
[8:46] this man this prophet man
[8:48] this um
[8:50] this prophet's got elijah's got to come
[8:52] before jesus come all right and his
[8:54] disciples said why should the scribes
[8:56] say life must first come and jesus
[8:58] answered and said unto them elijah truly
[9:00] shall first come and restore all things
[9:03] now we know for a fact who that was that
[9:05] was the prophet in the end time
[9:07] the um
[9:08] forthcoming of elijah through the
[9:10] prophet william branham and restore all
[9:13] things because john the baptist did not
[9:15] restore all things
[9:16] john the baptist came to introduce the
[9:18] one that was going to restore all things
[9:21] but i say unto you that elias has come
[9:23] already now see he switched right around
[9:25] and told him that john the baptist was
[9:27] there identifying who that man was
[9:30] and they knew him not but have done unto
[9:32] him whatever they listed likewise shall
[9:34] also
[9:35] the son of man suffer
[9:38] of them you may be seated in the lord as
[9:40] blessing to them
[9:41] the reading of the word
[9:45] i like what brother joe forney says
[9:47] thank the lord for the reading of the
[9:49] word
[9:52] we can go home now and be just fine
[9:55] but we're not
[9:58] now
[9:58] as we see this come
[10:00] in this part of matthew
[10:04] josh wanna how about get me some water i
[10:06] didn't do my deacon duties and get my
[10:07] own water
[10:08] usually i do
[10:10] thank you
[10:11] but we see the order of his coming
[10:14] and listen to what the prophet said on
[10:15] the patmos vision 1960
[10:19] 1204
[10:20] now notice before jesus returns to the
[10:22] earth now this is a little ahead of time
[10:25] but the spirit of elijah will return
[10:27] back to the earth and turn the hearts of
[10:29] the children back to the fathers
[10:31] the bible said so jesus saw him
[10:34] there the apostles saw him there the
[10:37] order of the coming of the son of man
[10:39] glorified
[10:41] he is to be glorified and coming back
[10:44] amen the first thing before they saw him
[10:47] was what
[10:49] elijah
[10:51] then what moses
[10:53] which was a type of israel returning
[10:55] yonder the law keepers and then the
[10:57] glorified son of man amen hallelujah do
[11:01] you see the order of his coming the
[11:02] spirit of elijah or the witness of the
[11:04] last church age
[11:06] coming in power to manifest him
[11:09] so there he's identifying that that son
[11:11] of man has got to come back in the end
[11:13] time not the spirit of john the baptist
[11:16] elijah that was to introduce the son of
[11:18] man
[11:19] to bring him to a death
[11:22] the first time
[11:24] and then he's to
[11:26] raise again or if you are dead and you
[11:29] raise
[11:30] one time and here he says that he rose
[11:32] again from the dead amen all right
[11:36] now we know for a fact this is not a
[11:38] physical killing but it's actually worse
[11:41] right
[11:42] it's worse
[11:43] because it's a spiritual killing
[11:45] you can be alive and be dead the bible
[11:47] says the if the light in you be darkness
[11:50] how great is that darkness in other
[11:52] words you think it's light but it's
[11:54] nothing but darkness right all around
[11:56] thank you
[12:01] so we see that now we see elijah coming
[12:03] to the gentiles moses to the 144 000.
[12:06] we know elijah and moses are both going
[12:08] but elijah's got to first come here
[12:10] and he did through the prophet to bring
[12:12] us a message to the gentiles
[12:15] to turn us back
[12:18] to take us out of here and then come
[12:19] back to the jews all right
[12:22] now where is he going to rise again the
[12:25] first time he rose from the dead he rose
[12:27] physically out of a grave amen all right
[12:30] we're going to go through and do it one
[12:32] two three four five down the line and
[12:34] show
[12:35] how this son of man
[12:37] was killed again or
[12:40] was put down by the people but he rose
[12:44] again not
[12:45] physically
[12:47] but he rose again where in the hearts of
[12:49] the people
[12:51] not one person
[12:52] exactly all right he rose again as the
[12:55] son of man
[12:58] as one person but when he come back on
[13:00] the day of pentecost he left that flesh
[13:02] and came on
[13:04] the people in the baptism of the holy
[13:06] ghost the son of god dispensation or the
[13:08] spirit god but we'll get to that in just
[13:10] a second but watch god tonight
[13:14] right up to this hour that we're we're
[13:16] living today today tonight amen all
[13:18] right because if not then we've left the
[13:21] god somewhere else
[13:23] and he's a dead god if we leave him
[13:25] somewhere right so he's not a dead god
[13:27] he's an alive god he's an alive god
[13:30] because you brought him here tonight
[13:31] because you're still alive right all
[13:33] right so now let's go back and look
[13:36] because there's a dispensation of the
[13:38] son of
[13:39] god that had to come first because god
[13:42] was first elohim our spirit
[13:45] all right
[13:48] was spirit
[13:51] elohim self-existing right right
[13:55] spirit god amen
[13:58] not a spook like a like a uh you know
[14:02] casper the friendly ghost when we think
[14:04] of spirit uh i said to of course i work
[14:07] with
[14:08] several hundred hispanics and they're
[14:09] all several hundred of them catholics
[14:11] when they want to be
[14:14] and
[14:15] just for your information if you have an
[14:17] iphone if you're a catholic you can now
[14:19] go on your iphone and get an application
[14:21] that lets you
[14:22] um
[14:24] do your
[14:25] confessions over your telephone
[14:29] that's the truth and josh we
[14:31] pulled it up on in our iphone and you
[14:34] can app mom and him were there dad was
[14:35] there you can actually go on your iphone
[14:38] and if you've committed a sin or an
[14:39] adultery or killed somebody you can
[14:41] immediately get on your phone
[14:43] and contact the priest and let him of
[14:46] course you got to send him a little
[14:47] money but he will say a prayer for you
[14:50] and intercede
[14:52] so and it's foolishness you know it's
[14:54] just the foolishness of man
[14:56] but
[14:57] there's a real god
[14:58] amen right
[15:00] they may worship that one but there's a
[15:02] real one right there's one that's alive
[15:04] never died right never will die
[15:08] but that self-existing elohim
[15:11] came in the form of the son of god
[15:14] the first
[15:15] form
[15:16] that he comes into us this is elementary
[15:18] but it we got to go somewhere with it
[15:23] logos or theophany the spirit god he was
[15:26] not in human flesh at that time
[15:29] all right
[15:30] but he did start on his way
[15:34] to human flesh amen
[15:36] because he created the earth to get it
[15:38] from
[15:40] because had there not been a fall
[15:43] guess what would have happened
[15:46] that son of god would have been
[15:48] god in human flesh right all right
[15:53] you say you how do you know that well
[15:54] that's what it's going to end up right
[15:57] and we got to go back to that we can't
[15:59] get out of the book of genesis and make
[16:01] it something different when we get over
[16:03] to the book of revelation
[16:05] all right
[16:06] so that son of god that logos theophany
[16:08] spirit god it wasn't that he didn't have
[16:10] a form he was a human man because in
[16:12] genesis 1 26 he said let us make
[16:15] man in our image and in our likeness
[16:18] that was the first time god was
[16:20] declaring how he was going to make more
[16:23] sons amen
[16:25] right and daughters that's right let us
[16:27] make man and let them have dominion over
[16:29] the sea
[16:30] the fish and the fowl the air and all
[16:32] the things that's why i love that that
[16:34] scripture it just it comes so alive to
[16:36] know that
[16:37] that god had made a place for us amen
[16:40] and that you know jesus even came and
[16:42] said now i go to prepare a place for you
[16:44] well he prepared it before the
[16:45] foundation of the world he didn't wait
[16:47] till he got there on earth and then
[16:49] started preparing a place for the people
[16:51] right now he started when he started
[16:53] saying let there be he was preparing a
[16:55] place for you and i to live
[16:57] all right
[16:58] he did not wait till he came the first
[17:00] time
[17:01] to to create anything and now he when he
[17:04] said let there be let there be let it be
[17:06] it was all brother mark for you and i
[17:08] right
[17:08] it was not for him he's not a selfish
[17:10] god
[17:11] that's right all right
[17:13] so in genesis 1 26 he's he's declaring
[17:16] how he's going to make more sons he said
[17:19] multiply and replenish the earth and we
[17:21] were not in any sexual form to do that
[17:25] it was a spirit man a man that was not
[17:28] created and set aside no it was god just
[17:33] expanding himself
[17:35] showing that he was because he was still
[17:37] let on him remember we've read in
[17:38] scripture many times and this may be a
[17:40] little more for them for maybe the
[17:42] people that are there watching but but
[17:44] god in in genesis 1 there 30 times the
[17:47] word god is used and that's the elohim
[17:50] self existing even after genesis 1 26
[17:53] where he said let us you think that's
[17:55] plurality or and in god it's not because
[17:58] god when when he looks at his bride he
[18:00] looks he sees one man
[18:02] when you look at your wife do you see
[18:03] four or five
[18:05] no you see one
[18:07] if you got a problem with that then you
[18:09] got a problem with that if you look and
[18:11] see four or five
[18:13] but that's what god wanted to do and
[18:15] that's what he begun to do because then
[18:18] he took a piece of that genesis 1 26 and
[18:20] put it in a man called adam and there
[18:23] was
[18:24] god in human flesh
[18:28] amen that's how he got started
[18:31] god in human flesh right
[18:33] in adam
[18:35] adam even had so much control over the
[18:37] things till he was the god of the earth
[18:41] and as we say all right well then adam
[18:44] lost it
[18:46] but i'm going to read you a quote in a
[18:47] few minutes if i can get to it where
[18:49] brother brown said the son of man is the
[18:51] heir of the earth
[18:56] see the son of man will never be
[18:57] singular anymore right right
[19:00] he will not and i'll read it to you in
[19:02] just a minute he will not be saying
[19:03] there was one son of man walked on the
[19:05] face of the earth that was god almighty
[19:07] pure and human flesh glory all right
[19:11] but now he didn't come just to make that
[19:13] was his way
[19:14] to not go around but that was his way to
[19:17] get through that genesis to back to that
[19:19] genesis 1 condition
[19:22] genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity between thy
[19:25] seed what he had to come in human right
[19:27] flesh
[19:29] human seed form
[19:30] to take the sin away
[19:32] so that we can go back right all right
[19:34] so adam was the first one in flesh right
[19:38] we'll hurry through this that's number
[19:39] three and i only got about
[19:42] number 16.
[19:45] but in the fall
[19:48] god had to hide
[19:50] itself amen right but he couldn't hide
[19:52] itself in human
[19:54] flesh anymore
[19:56] right
[19:58] he had to withdraw from that because
[20:00] that human being had
[20:02] caused a condition to happen to where
[20:05] god couldn't get inside that man again
[20:09] not saying he never will because that's
[20:11] his purpose
[20:12] was to have man in his own image and in
[20:15] his likeness and to have rulership over
[20:17] something
[20:18] all right
[20:20] but god had to then in the old testament
[20:23] he had to hide in the form of clouds
[20:25] right and fire
[20:29] and burning bushes amen that's right
[20:32] everybody understand see amen amen all
[20:35] right
[20:36] holy of holies
[20:39] badger skin could only contain god for a
[20:42] time
[20:44] god wanted to get back in man when he
[20:48] screamed brother dean in genesis 3 15
[20:50] when he screamed that out that was the
[20:53] way he was going to do it and that's the
[20:55] way he made for us to come back
[20:58] so there's nothing we do
[21:01] it's what he does
[21:03] genesis 3 15 i'm going to bring you
[21:08] back
[21:11] right i'm going to go through the old
[21:12] testament though
[21:16] and i'm going to rest on a group of
[21:18] people
[21:19] but i can't dwell in that group of
[21:22] people
[21:24] right
[21:25] right he would anoint moses he would
[21:27] anoint
[21:28] even ezekiel i was reading in ezekiel
[21:30] where i think in ezekiel about 60
[21:32] something times god says son of man
[21:36] prophesy
[21:37] right all through the old testament but
[21:39] it's son of man prophesy amen son of man
[21:44] prophesy
[21:45] all right what was he doing he was
[21:47] coming down for a moment in human flesh
[21:51] speaking
[21:52] what he was going to do
[21:54] right what he was going to do amen
[21:57] all right
[22:00] so the son of god rested on a group of
[22:02] people the prophet said
[22:04] with faith
[22:07] abraham had faith
[22:09] and god honored that faith right
[22:12] moses had faith
[22:14] and god honored moses faith
[22:17] but yet they were not
[22:19] what god wanted to rest in
[22:24] because he couldn't get to him
[22:26] because of the badger skin because of
[22:28] the veil that was put there by me and
[22:31] you
[22:32] unbelief
[22:33] but in ezekiel 1
[22:36] read that for yourself to save time but
[22:38] in ezekiel 1 he says son of man
[22:41] prophesy right actually we got a few
[22:44] more let's go to ezekiel 1.
[22:47] because you watch this group of people
[22:49] jeremiah ezekiel and watch what's going
[22:52] to happen i told the brother the other
[22:53] night when brother uh smith was here
[22:55] talking about the interval
[22:57] you know there was
[22:59] church ages in the old testament
[23:01] remember we proved that we we drew it up
[23:03] on the board and showed how moses could
[23:05] be would be the pattern messenger and
[23:07] and how that the last messenger to the
[23:10] seventh age would be john the baptist to
[23:13] introduce who jesus christ just like it
[23:15] is in the end time but remember there
[23:17] was an interval between the old
[23:18] testament and the new testament
[23:23] from malachi
[23:25] to john
[23:26] there was 400 years there was no prophet
[23:30] there was no priest there was no they
[23:32] just lived their life day to day did the
[23:35] sacrifice and then all of a sudden here
[23:37] you see john the baptist come on the
[23:38] scene god was doing something though
[23:40] during that time god is never idle all
[23:42] right ezekiel
[23:43] 1
[23:45] look at verse
[23:47] to me here we go again back to parallel
[23:50] revelations and uh you know and what
[23:52] what brother dale's been bringing out it
[23:54] has been become more real
[23:57] because
[23:58] i look in ezekiel and i read chapter one
[24:01] looks just like revelations four yeah
[24:04] now it came to pass thirteenth year
[24:06] fourth month by the river chi bar that
[24:08] the heavens were open
[24:09] and i saw a vision of god where was the
[24:11] open door revelations four right all
[24:14] right and then ezekiel goes up through
[24:16] that door into heaven caught up
[24:19] and watched what he saw look at verse
[24:21] four
[24:22] and i looked and behold a whirlwind came
[24:24] out of the north a great cloud
[24:26] and a fire
[24:28] and a brightness and out of the mix with
[24:30] the color of amber what was that that's
[24:33] revelations 1 where john is describing
[24:36] jesus christ glory
[24:38] and also look at verse 5 and also out of
[24:40] the midst thereof now where did he see
[24:44] the son of man in revelations 1 in the
[24:47] midst of the golden candlesticks also of
[24:50] the myths thereof came the likeness of
[24:52] four living creatures now who are those
[24:54] four living creatures given to
[24:56] the bride of jesus christ
[24:58] all right
[24:59] because the prophet saw there in
[25:00] revelation where the uh in this fourth
[25:03] seal in the fifth seal he said you don't
[25:06] see the the the uh living creatures
[25:08] anymore he says therefore the rapture
[25:10] took place in the fourth seal
[25:12] because those four combat beasts are
[25:14] given to me and you to combat the devil
[25:18] four living creatures and this was their
[25:20] appearance they had the likeness
[25:24] of a man
[25:25] revelations one john turns and sees in
[25:28] the midst of the golden candlesticks
[25:30] which is what
[25:32] the church ages right the living
[25:34] creatures he sees a man standing in the
[25:37] midst in the midst
[25:39] just like he saw there in revelation
[25:41] chapter one and if you'll read all the
[25:42] way through there you'll see the
[25:44] absolute same thing
[25:46] revelations four and five you see one
[25:48] over there in verse 26 you'll see one
[25:51] sitting on the throne
[25:53] and upon the likeness of the throne with
[25:55] the likeness as the appearance of a man
[25:58] had to be a man now look at chapter two
[25:59] he starts off right here
[26:02] and i say unto you son of man stand upon
[26:05] thy feet and i will speak unto thee
[26:08] if you'll go through there you're going
[26:10] to see
[26:13] that ezekiel
[26:15] remember in the old testament
[26:17] they used scrolls
[26:20] right
[26:22] but now john was told in revelations 10
[26:25] to take
[26:27] a book
[26:28] man
[26:29] we have books in the end time right
[26:32] they had scrolls back then
[26:34] all right
[26:36] ezekiel 2 verse 9 when i looked and
[26:38] behold a hand was sent unto me and lo a
[26:41] roll
[26:42] of a book
[26:44] was therein
[26:45] and he spread it before me and it was
[26:47] written within and without didn't
[26:49] revelation 5 say there was a book sealed
[26:51] on the what inside and the outside
[26:53] exactly and there was written there in
[26:55] lamentations and mornings and woes what
[26:58] was that there's your seven seals
[27:00] moreover he said unto me verse three or
[27:02] chapter three verse one more ever said
[27:04] unto me look at that capital s that's
[27:07] not the beginning of a sentence right so
[27:09] that's not just talking to ezekiel
[27:10] that's talking to the son of man
[27:12] all right eat
[27:14] that vow find us
[27:17] what do you tell john to do in
[27:18] revelation 10 about 8-9 he said eat that
[27:20] book
[27:21] eat this roll and go speak unto the
[27:24] house of israel
[27:27] so i opened my mouth and he caused me to
[27:29] eat that roll
[27:31] and he said unto me son of man caused
[27:33] thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels
[27:36] with this roll that i give thee
[27:38] then did i eat it and it was in my mouth
[27:41] what
[27:42] as honey
[27:43] for sweetness
[27:45] right and he said unto me son of man go
[27:47] get thee into the house of israel and
[27:49] speak with my words
[27:51] unto them for thou art not sent to a
[27:54] people of strange speech out of an hard
[27:56] language
[27:58] but to the bride of jesus
[28:00] christ if you want to say that that's
[28:03] not changing the word of god i believe
[28:04] we're the house of israel spiritually
[28:06] don't you
[28:07] but you see how parallels when i was
[28:09] looking at the son of man i went back to
[28:11] ezekiel like i said about 60 something
[28:13] times
[28:16] god is speaking through ezekiel then you
[28:18] see that son of man becoming so real
[28:23] that you can't separate them but then
[28:24] you have to separate them because they
[28:26] were not the son of man
[28:29] they were not the son of man the son of
[28:31] man is the lord jesus christ
[28:33] all right so let's not get that mixed up
[28:35] ezekiel was not a born again believer he
[28:37] was not a he was not a
[28:39] a son of god by a birth because they
[28:42] couldn't be birthed in the old testament
[28:45] because jesus hadn't died to release the
[28:47] life to birth them with
[28:48] all right that's just so simple but a
[28:51] lot of people in the message have a real
[28:52] hard time believing that right
[28:54] and i don't see why
[28:56] and it's not degrading i believe
[28:58] abraham's the son of god
[29:01] i believe ezekiel's the son of god
[29:04] but not by birth
[29:06] not in the original creation
[29:10] you and i are we're born again we're in
[29:12] the original creation amen right all
[29:15] right these others are allowed or are
[29:18] given eternal life by the faith that
[29:20] they had right right that's it because
[29:22] brother branham was saying he said look
[29:24] at all them great people of faith right
[29:26] not even born again shouldn't we be
[29:28] ashamed of ourselves
[29:29] that moses could call fleas clouds and
[29:31] frogs under the blood of bulls and goats
[29:33] and we can't even have faith for a
[29:35] headache
[29:36] amen
[29:40] you love the lord amen well i do too
[29:42] more than ever
[29:45] but these people in the old testament
[29:47] were not just floundering floundering
[29:49] around not doing anything they were
[29:51] actually
[29:53] putting a a platform or a place for the
[29:56] son of man to rest on
[29:59] right
[30:00] because what did they do they built that
[30:02] body for the son of man to rest in for
[30:04] the son of god to rest in to make him
[30:06] the son of man which is god in human
[30:09] flesh
[30:10] but that was they were put there to
[30:12] introduce one man right
[30:15] all those prophets in the old testament
[30:18] were there to introduce one man
[30:20] now he said boy you really narrowed it
[30:22] down now in that man is all this bible
[30:26] in that one man was all this eternal
[30:28] life right
[30:30] in that bible where you and i sitting
[30:31] here tonight if you're born again come
[30:33] on
[30:34] so let's just don't say well it was all
[30:36] in one man and that was it
[30:38] no it was all that one man but he didn't
[30:40] want to stay that way right
[30:43] he did not want to stay that's that one
[30:45] inside of him was wanting to release the
[30:48] life
[30:49] that's what he came to do
[30:51] right right right that's what he came to
[30:54] do i come to do my own will that's not
[30:56] what he said
[30:57] i came to do the will of the father the
[30:59] son of god the spirit inside of him that
[31:03] said let there be light amen thou art
[31:06] the christ the son of the living god we
[31:07] know you're the creator god somewhere
[31:09] inside of that man right exactly
[31:13] because no man can do these things
[31:15] except like nicodemus said say it except
[31:17] he come from god right amen
[31:21] okay
[31:22] but now nicodemus didn't go a step
[31:24] further
[31:25] and take that god and put it in his
[31:27] heart right
[31:28] that was the problem he had
[31:31] is that the problem we have
[31:33] because i hear people talk of the son of
[31:35] man sure this is the son of man
[31:36] dispensation brother branham brought the
[31:38] son of man this is the son of man
[31:40] ministry
[31:41] i'll promise you one thing
[31:43] i'm telling them downstairs in the sunny
[31:45] school class i'm getting a little ahead
[31:46] of myself but that's okay
[31:49] if you're born again tonight
[31:51] you have a revelation of the son of god
[31:53] right
[31:54] because if you're born again you have to
[31:56] have a revelation to get born again
[31:58] so you have a revelation of the son of
[32:00] god amen the son of god is the new birth
[32:03] is the spirit god the logos the
[32:05] theophany that came to you and changed
[32:08] your life right amen
[32:11] but that's not the son of man revelation
[32:16] but just cause you live in this age i'll
[32:18] read it in just a few minutes but not
[32:20] sure this generation will receive it but
[32:22] it's because of luke 17.
[32:27] in this day
[32:29] is the reason we're getting it right
[32:32] all right so just keep that in your hat
[32:34] for a minute and then and chew on it a
[32:36] while we'll get to it in just a moment
[32:38] maybe about 8 30 we'll be done
[32:42] now when they introduced
[32:45] god in human flesh the prophets built
[32:47] the body
[32:48] a body that has prepared me in hebrews
[32:50] 10 i believe it was believe it is
[32:53] there was a body made by creation
[32:58] and that son of god stepped into that
[33:00] body
[33:01] called the son of man
[33:03] which was god in human flesh one man
[33:05] there was nobody else on the face of the
[33:07] earth when jesus was on earth that had
[33:10] that
[33:11] capacity or that office right all right
[33:14] he was the only one
[33:17] now listen to what brother branham said
[33:19] it's kind of
[33:20] i just found this quote just a few
[33:22] minutes ago
[33:24] listen to what we we always think of the
[33:26] son of man and just say well that was
[33:27] jesus the
[33:29] you know the the sacrifice the one to
[33:31] give his life you know but listen to
[33:32] this
[33:33] because i believe one thing and and i
[33:35] beat this scripture to death but when
[33:37] jesus said all power in heaven earth has
[33:38] been given unto me that was the son of
[33:40] man
[33:42] right
[33:43] that was god in human flesh
[33:46] but now listen
[33:47] in revelation chapter 1 1960-1204
[33:52] he was son of man prophet amen
[33:55] he was son of man sacrifice priest
[33:59] he son of man as king amen
[34:03] the son of david sitting on the throne
[34:05] of his majesty
[34:07] son of man
[34:08] god manifested as son of man he came
[34:11] down and became man to take sin away
[34:13] from the world he became man as a
[34:15] prophet
[34:16] he became man as a priest he became man
[34:20] as a king
[34:21] king of heaven amen king of saints
[34:26] the eternal king always was king
[34:30] always will be king
[34:32] eternal king he said that was the son of
[34:34] man amen
[34:36] we always think well that's just son of
[34:38] man and just jesus christ right there in
[34:39] human flesh
[34:41] all that all the attributes that are in
[34:45] jesus christ
[34:46] is just what i said now there's offices
[34:48] that he that he proved when he was on
[34:50] earth priest
[34:52] king prophet
[34:54] sacrifice
[34:56] but it was still god in human flesh
[34:58] and it's not any different now it's just
[35:00] any mini member body right
[35:03] so now
[35:05] this baby that was born that grew up
[35:09] inside of that
[35:10] child
[35:12] was the son of god amen right
[35:17] believe it or not
[35:19] most people in the message don't
[35:23] but he was born
[35:24] lord the christ
[35:26] the son of god
[35:32] but he was the son of man that's right
[35:35] we're the son of god inside of it
[35:37] not two different people
[35:39] one person
[35:41] all right
[35:43] and i think that's the mystery that we
[35:46] and i want to say this in a in a light
[35:48] form
[35:49] sometimes we think that
[35:51] we're born again so there's another
[35:53] person
[35:55] don't get me wrong
[35:56] it was it was god
[35:58] but when god comes in brother branham
[36:00] made a statement one time he said this
[36:02] is my eye
[36:04] he said god
[36:06] gave it to me and now it's mine right
[36:10] god gave me the holy ghost and now whose
[36:12] is it it's mine right
[36:14] we ain't in there fighting together
[36:16] right
[36:17] it should be one
[36:19] man
[36:20] not two
[36:21] if you got two in there it's the devil
[36:24] excuse me so this person that walked on
[36:27] the earth and i'm saying this in a form
[36:29] i want you to see
[36:31] this son of man was motivated by the son
[36:33] of god
[36:34] amen
[36:35] right exactly he was motivated by the
[36:38] son of god
[36:39] he said i do nothing
[36:41] now that didn't mean that he didn't live
[36:42] in human life and do the things of human
[36:44] life god didn't have to tell him when to
[36:46] eat and god didn't have to tell him
[36:47] that's not true
[36:50] i believe that he was all the time god
[36:52] but he was all the time human amen
[36:55] all right uh some people say well he
[36:57] spoke this and he spoke that well that's
[36:58] okay you know if he was speaking to the
[37:00] disciples and said you know i'm hungry
[37:01] go get me something deep maybe that
[37:03] wasn't prophecy that we needed
[37:05] but
[37:06] it was still god talking
[37:08] it was still god speaking it was still
[37:10] god motivating it was not someone else
[37:12] motivating someone else if you do then
[37:15] you got two people brother gary and
[37:16] you've got two persons
[37:18] all right so no you've only got one
[37:20] person
[37:21] now but now this man was not completely
[37:26] here we go
[37:28] he was not complete
[37:31] until he come to the river jordan to
[37:33] receive something exactly
[37:36] not another son of god
[37:40] not another holy ghost
[37:44] but what was in him was anointed
[37:47] for a job
[37:48] amen it was just a girl that something
[37:51] came from somewhere else and
[37:53] and this other person now resides no
[37:56] he was gone all the time
[37:58] he was son of man son of god you read
[38:01] the prophet what he said here he was
[38:03] king priest prophet the whole thing
[38:06] and then something came upon this man
[38:09] amen
[38:11] that come from god
[38:14] father spirit amen
[38:16] that had not been given to him before
[38:20] exactly it was a message
[38:23] a way to get me and you out of him amen
[38:28] that's the whole thing that is the whole
[38:30] nutshell that is the whole message in a
[38:32] nutshell
[38:33] god brought
[38:35] this flesh alive onto the face of the
[38:38] earth
[38:39] with us bottled up inside of him
[38:42] and there was no way for us to get out
[38:46] unless he did it in a spiritual form not
[38:49] a natural form
[38:51] so it had to be the spiritual word of
[38:54] god
[38:56] come out of that man's mouth
[38:58] amen
[38:59] that we now read called the word of god
[39:03] matthew mark luke and john every how you
[39:05] want to say it that three and a half
[39:06] year message
[39:08] but out of that three and a half year
[39:09] message you and i were quickened out of
[39:12] our dead works
[39:14] into a living word the son of god came
[39:17] down and quickened that word in your
[39:19] heart
[39:22] and made you a son of god
[39:23] right
[39:24] right
[39:26] now
[39:28] but he was anointed at jordan for a
[39:30] message
[39:32] we hear the son of man speaking
[39:35] i do nothing
[39:37] unless i see the unless i see it first
[39:39] and the father shows me
[39:40] right that's what he was saying
[39:43] but
[39:45] what about the same man that walked up
[39:47] one day and said destroy this temple
[39:50] right
[39:51] and i know my father will raise it up in
[39:53] three days
[39:55] that's not what he said
[39:58] he said
[39:59] you put it in the ground
[40:00] and i'll bring it back up
[40:04] i'm gonna tell you something
[40:06] whatever happens in that resurrection
[40:09] believe has got to be tied to what's
[40:11] going to happen in this resurrection
[40:13] because it can't be any different
[40:16] it's the same man standing doing the
[40:18] same thing right
[40:20] just in a many members body not in one
[40:22] person
[40:28] that's just how much i believe that god
[40:30] was in that flesh doing the work
[40:32] and you couldn't separate that man in
[40:34] that flesh i mean that god in that flesh
[40:40] and brother branham would give the
[40:41] illustration he'd say you know the lady
[40:43] said well jesus wept
[40:46] he said sure he said when he walked by
[40:48] that tree
[40:49] and he needed something to eat and he
[40:50] looked at that tree and it wasn't
[40:51] bringing forth fruit he just cursed it
[40:54] he said was that a man
[40:56] or was that god right
[40:59] he said surely he was man when he went
[41:01] to the grave of lazarus he cried
[41:03] he said when he throw them little
[41:04] shoulders back
[41:06] and called a man that had been dead for
[41:08] four days
[41:09] called his spirit back from wherever it
[41:11] was and put it back in that flesh and
[41:13] didn't just put it in that flesh and
[41:15] keep it rotten it took that flesh and
[41:18] restored it back to when it had died he
[41:20] said that's more than a man
[41:22] but now guess what
[41:24] that man didn't go anywhere
[41:26] that man is still here
[41:28] all right
[41:30] so now
[41:33] this man they put him on a cross and
[41:35] they killed him
[41:37] they killed the son of man because he
[41:38] said the son of man is going to have to
[41:40] go and give his life amen okay the son
[41:43] of man so it wasn't the son of man's
[41:45] life he gave and then they got another
[41:47] another life somewhere else
[41:50] um
[41:51] no
[41:51] because when he went to the garden of
[41:53] gethsemane that had that had that had
[41:56] what had protected him all those years
[41:58] for that three and a half years
[42:00] that ministry that anointing that power
[42:02] that he was given because remember when
[42:03] he was on the cross he said he said he
[42:06] said in other words where are you
[42:08] father where are you at yeah
[42:10] you know in my words it'd be like if if
[42:13] i had this superhuman anointing and here
[42:15] i went through life for three and a half
[42:17] years and nobody couldn't touch me i
[42:18] could walk through people you know right
[42:20] through the crowd and they wouldn't know
[42:21] me and and i could go do this and i
[42:23] could go do that and i could just
[42:24] command people to be healed and all of a
[42:26] sudden they got me hanging on a tree
[42:29] where did it go
[42:32] my god my god why is thou forsaken me in
[42:35] other words what you
[42:37] if i was to give josh everything in the
[42:39] world and all of a sudden i left him
[42:40] somewhere in the desert that'd be the
[42:42] same thing you'd say to me he said
[42:44] father why have you forsaken me why have
[42:45] you left me out here
[42:47] with nothing to do but it wasn't his
[42:50] will
[42:51] he gave that will up in gethsemane
[42:53] remember the prophet said that he had
[42:54] more he fought it out in gethsemane the
[42:57] cross was just what he did to to
[42:59] consummate but in the garden of
[43:01] gethsemane because what left him that
[43:03] same anointing that came on him there at
[43:05] the river jordan that anointing for his
[43:07] message
[43:09] left him right remember he didn't have
[43:11] nothing else to say after gethsemane
[43:13] right he didn't have anything to say a
[43:15] pilate would say something to him he
[43:16] said you say
[43:18] you say unto this end i was born he
[43:20] didn't have a message anymore he was
[43:23] finished that message was done but the
[43:25] the job wasn't finished right
[43:28] he had already sown that message and
[43:30] that message was now in the hearts of
[43:31] those disciples
[43:33] right amen they were in the hearts of
[43:35] their disciples he had sowed the seed
[43:37] word somewhere
[43:39] and then he had to die to release that
[43:41] life to quicken that word that they held
[43:44] all right
[43:45] now same thing happens to me and you
[43:47] you got to hear the word of god before
[43:49] you can be born again amen you can't
[43:51] just holler and scream i'm in the
[43:53] message you got to hear the message amen
[43:55] it's not just the message come on
[43:57] brother all right
[43:59] so he died the son of man now that's
[44:01] when he was on the
[44:02] mountain in matthew 17 he said the son
[44:04] of man until he be risen again right so
[44:08] he died the first time a natural
[44:10] death
[44:12] there was no life in that flesh when
[44:14] they put it in the tomb right
[44:17] right right
[44:18] not a bit of life nowhere come
[44:20] on
[44:22] but the son of god just removed himself
[44:25] from that shell right and continued his
[44:27] work right because he had to go to hell
[44:30] he couldn't go to hell in human flesh
[44:32] he had to go to hell as the son of god
[44:34] back in the old testament
[44:36] because who did he go to
[44:38] he went to the souls that were lost in
[44:41] noah's age
[44:42] all those people that billions of people
[44:44] that died during the flood he was down
[44:46] there saying hey i'm the man right
[44:49] but there was no difference from that
[44:50] man laying in the grave except for the
[44:52] age because when he opened the door of
[44:54] paradise remember what abraham said he
[44:56] said sarah that's the man that we ate
[44:58] calf with right ezekiel the same ezekiel
[45:01] right here said oh that's the wheel in
[45:02] the middle of the wheel what jesus
[45:04] christ amen he was in spirit theophany
[45:06] form in the old testament so they knew
[45:08] who he was they identified with him by
[45:11] the way they saw him in that old
[45:12] testament right
[45:16] then he carried them up and then come
[45:18] back
[45:20] down
[45:22] to live
[45:24] for 30 40 days with the people right
[45:27] but in matthew 28 18
[45:30] he said all power in heaven and earth
[45:32] right has been given unto me
[45:36] and he said go into all the world in
[45:37] other words let me rephrase that he said
[45:40] all power heaven that's been given to me
[45:41] but in about 10 or 11 more days you're
[45:43] going to get that power all right but
[45:46] what you're not going to do is you're
[45:48] not going to get the mystery of who this
[45:50] man is
[45:52] this son of man
[45:53] all right because in acts 1 remember in
[45:56] acts go turn to the book of acts and
[45:58] let's read that real quick
[46:02] in acts 1 remember while he was still
[46:04] alive they were still asking him
[46:06] questions about what are you going to do
[46:08] you're going to leave us here you're
[46:09] going to restore the kingdom what are
[46:10] you going to do
[46:13] jesus told him he said what go and wait
[46:15] right go and tarry but you shall receive
[46:17] verse 8 power after
[46:19] after
[46:21] exactly
[46:22] we are powerless without the holy ghost
[46:24] folks
[46:26] we are powerless
[46:28] amen without the word of god alive in
[46:30] our life
[46:33] but you shall receive power after that
[46:35] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[46:37] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[46:39] jerusalem and judea and samaria and here
[46:41] we are unto the uttermost part of the
[46:43] earth amen
[46:44] and when he had spoken these things
[46:46] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[46:48] cloud received him out of their sight
[46:50] that was the son of man leaving
[46:53] right then the human flesh son of man
[46:56] jesus christ was coming
[46:59] up off the earth
[47:01] right
[47:02] and you're not going to see that part of
[47:04] that man in that form
[47:06] until what the millennium and we're
[47:08] going to see him in the air all right
[47:10] but he's not going to come back down on
[47:12] this earth in that physical form one man
[47:16] until the millennium right right all
[47:18] right
[47:18] but
[47:19] that doesn't mean
[47:22] because remember he said go to jerusalem
[47:26] and i'm going to give you this power
[47:27] right
[47:28] so he didn't just take it with him donny
[47:32] he sent it back
[47:33] glory
[47:34] and while they looked steadfast toward
[47:36] heaven as he went up behold two men
[47:38] stood by them in white raiment and white
[47:40] apparel which also said you men of
[47:42] galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[47:45] heaven right
[47:47] why do we pray why does all them ball
[47:49] players when they do something good they
[47:51] go
[47:54] all right
[47:56] because they think there's a god well
[47:58] i'm on video
[48:00] they think there's a god up here
[48:05] and i and i'm not i'm not criticizing
[48:07] people there's a lot of people pray like
[48:09] this
[48:10] but he's not up there right
[48:15] he said
[48:16] the men say why stand ye gazing up into
[48:19] heaven
[48:21] they're asking the people a question
[48:24] this same jesus which is taken up from
[48:27] you this same jesus
[48:31] which is taken up from you into heaven
[48:35] shall so come in like manner as you have
[48:39] seen him go
[48:41] into heaven
[48:43] now
[48:45] that to me has two parts
[48:47] one part is
[48:48] every eye is going to see that man one
[48:50] day
[48:51] coming in the clouds of glory like they
[48:53] all say you know the old baptist said to
[48:55] me one time he said i'll be glad when
[48:57] that old eastern sky splits back and and
[49:00] god and you know jesus walks out of that
[49:03] cloud just walks right down on the earth
[49:05] and just takes over
[49:06] and i just let him go i should have said
[49:08] well that you missed it if you see that
[49:11] you missed the real coming that he
[49:13] wanted you to see
[49:14] because the real coming is when he come
[49:16] again remember
[49:18] he said when the son of man is risen
[49:20] again
[49:20] come on
[49:22] that's when he'll come back in power and
[49:24] authority
[49:25] all right
[49:26] so now
[49:28] here we go in number 12 we're about
[49:30] we're okay
[49:32] the holy ghost is the son of god
[49:36] understanding
[49:37] right we we say
[49:40] we sing i want to see you
[49:43] c means to understand right you're
[49:45] really singing you want to understand
[49:47] him
[49:48] because look we will not see him in
[49:51] human flesh like they saw him on the
[49:53] earth 2 000 years ago until we meet him
[49:56] in the air so let's don't look for jesus
[49:58] christ in one literal form to to come
[50:02] appear among us
[50:05] he is now and always will be
[50:09] multiple
[50:10] foreign that genesis 1 26 and 27 has now
[50:14] been made manifest right
[50:18] when he come on the earth he was one man
[50:21] that genesis 1 26 and 27 that theophany
[50:24] was right there with that man jesus
[50:25] christ
[50:28] and that's why
[50:30] that when brother branham said we walked
[50:32] with him on the shores of galilee
[50:34] we were inside of him
[50:36] that was the eternal life that man had
[50:38] you were not in there as a little seed
[50:40] or a little germ or a little bitty
[50:41] theophany running around in his body
[50:43] somewhere
[50:44] you were in seed form in the word that
[50:47] he was amen
[50:49] seed form in the word he was not from
[50:52] the loins of man anymore it's from the
[50:55] spoken word
[50:56] and that's what he was doing he was
[50:58] speaking the word
[50:59] because what called you right what
[51:02] called you to repentance
[51:04] something jesus said or something the
[51:06] apostle said that jesus said
[51:09] that's what brought you to repentance
[51:12] you saw a god that came and died for
[51:14] your sins
[51:16] that was the word calling your name
[51:19] back to the predestination right that's
[51:22] what called you and you accepted it
[51:24] right
[51:25] all right but here we come down through
[51:27] the church ages now in revelations 1
[51:30] let's go to revelations 1.
[51:35] everybody all right
[51:44] see i can see more and more now brother
[51:46] nick how we used to talk before about
[51:48] saying jesus jesus did not get anything
[51:51] right
[51:53] we always like to throw that off
[51:56] kind of sad that we kind of throw things
[51:57] off on denomination
[51:59] we really shouldn't
[52:02] jesus jesus was with his own disciples
[52:05] with his own people and one of them is
[52:07] one that portrayed him that's right okay
[52:09] so let's don't throw off and say well in
[52:11] plural denominations and that's true and
[52:13] i've been accused of doing that and i
[52:14] apologize
[52:15] because god can work in many mysterious
[52:18] ways
[52:19] all right but
[52:20] when you come down to it
[52:24] you can be in this message and say jesus
[52:25] jesus you're not getting anything amen
[52:28] because when god moves from that son of
[52:30] god dispensation over in the son of man
[52:32] dispensation
[52:34] and that's going to be an individual
[52:36] thing it's not going to be 1994 2010
[52:39] 2011.
[52:41] when you say dispensation everybody said
[52:43] well that's from the 40s to the 50s or
[52:44] the 50 no in god it's an individual
[52:47] affair
[52:48] you can be sitting here tonight and if
[52:50] you're born again tonight listen if
[52:51] you're born again tonight you do have
[52:53] the understanding of the son of god
[52:55] because you understood that what
[52:57] happened to that man
[53:00] god
[53:01] was in that man that man died for your
[53:04] sins amen that was almighty god and some
[53:07] way brother and this is a quote brother
[53:08] brown said some way he got back down in
[53:10] your soul
[53:13] because i was unredeemable
[53:15] and so were you
[53:17] but some way god came down through there
[53:20] and birthed himself into me amen
[53:24] and that's the son of god revelation
[53:27] and that's the son of god understanding
[53:28] so down through the seven church ages
[53:30] that's what they got
[53:32] but
[53:33] that didn't leave the son of man out and
[53:35] everybody's like well the son of man
[53:36] only appeared in this generation
[53:39] well now in revelations chapter 1 verse
[53:42] 13 it doesn't say in the midst of the
[53:44] seven golden candlesticks one like unto
[53:46] the son of god right
[53:50] god was in human flesh the whole time
[53:52] amen
[53:53] paul peter james john amen all the
[53:56] church age messengers that was the son
[53:58] of man working in the people because
[54:00] they were god in human flesh but they
[54:02] didn't have the understanding for that
[54:05] right
[54:05] luke 17 30 had not been fulfilled yet
[54:08] god can't go past his word once he said
[54:11] in luke in the days and you know in the
[54:12] days of just like it was in noah's day
[54:14] just like it was in sodom's day just
[54:16] like it was in lots day
[54:18] that day hadn't started yet right
[54:21] and it wasn't a day like a 24-hour day
[54:24] it was a day that you and i stepped into
[54:26] it
[54:27] okay everybody understand it's the day
[54:28] that you're living in now
[54:31] we're sitting in the son of man
[54:33] dispensation but you may not be
[54:37] but if you're born again you at least
[54:38] have a revelation of what that eternal
[54:41] god did for you
[54:43] and that will birth you into the body
[54:45] god just claps his hand and says thank
[54:46] you i'm going to put you away
[54:49] not put you away like divorce you but
[54:51] put you away and protect you amen
[54:53] because i'm gonna put you in the grave
[54:55] and i'm gonna let your body rest for a
[54:57] while
[54:58] but that soul is gonna be a part of mine
[55:00] i'm not ever gonna lose it jesus told
[55:02] him he said whatever the father's got he
[55:04] won't lose one right
[55:06] what that genesis 1 26 man amen he went
[55:09] out and found that genesis 1 26 man
[55:13] on the earth and that's what he's doing
[55:15] now right he's finding those people
[55:18] and he's bringing him back to what to
[55:20] that one form not that we're going to be
[55:22] just one big theophany no he wanted us
[55:24] remember he wanted us to be male and
[55:26] female created he
[55:29] him right
[55:30] he created them
[55:32] male and female that's the way he wanted
[55:35] it
[55:36] all right
[55:37] but he couldn't do it because what
[55:38] happened in the garden but he's doing it
[55:40] now amen
[55:41] so it was the son of god understanding
[55:43] down through the church ages but it was
[55:46] not just the son of god working because
[55:48] we see in revelations chapter 1 verse 13
[55:51] says in the midst of the seven
[55:52] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[55:55] man
[55:56] so it was god in human flesh working
[55:58] through those people
[56:00] amen doing a work
[56:02] so you can't say well all they had was
[56:04] just the son of god revelation they did
[56:06] only have that
[56:08] but it was the god in human flesh you
[56:10] can't do away with the god in human
[56:12] flesh that's why i like this quote when
[56:14] brother brown said he was son of man
[56:16] prophet
[56:17] he was son of man sacrifice he was son
[56:20] of man priest
[56:21] he son of man king
[56:26] son of david sitting on the throne
[56:30] son of man god manifested that son of
[56:32] man he came down and became man to take
[56:34] sin away from the world he became a man
[56:37] as a prophet
[56:38] man as a priest man is the king king of
[56:40] heaven king of saints eternal king
[56:42] always was king always will be king
[56:44] eternal king
[56:45] that's the son of man he'll never lose
[56:47] that flesh right that flesh will always
[56:49] be there
[56:51] so he didn't lose it through the church
[56:52] ages what was lost right
[56:54] the son of man revelation was taken away
[56:57] from the church because of one thing
[56:59] you and i were not there right
[57:03] that'll either humble you or it'll blow
[57:05] your head up and if it blows your head
[57:06] up then
[57:08] you don't have the one inside of you to
[57:10] keep you
[57:15] listen queen of sheba 1960.
[57:18] brother branham said jesus says as it
[57:19] was in the days of sodom so shall it be
[57:21] in the coming of the son of man
[57:23] look at that angel down there to the
[57:25] church elect to what he done look at
[57:27] jesus what he's done in his generation
[57:29] look down here at this generation what
[57:31] he's doing now they'll receive a sign
[57:33] but they won't believe it right
[57:35] there you are but it
[57:37] but it comes just the same an evil and
[57:39] adulterous generation will seek after a
[57:41] son
[57:42] and they'll have it
[57:43] it'll be given to them as jonah was in
[57:45] the belly of the whale three days and
[57:46] three nights so the son of man will be
[57:48] in the heart of the earth three days and
[57:49] three nights but the resurrection will
[57:51] be the sign
[57:52] and the resurrection sign is given to
[57:55] the church in this last days amen
[57:58] and the angel of the holy spirit in the
[58:01] meetings in the meetings showing the
[58:03] same thing doing the same thing across
[58:05] the nation proving that jesus christ is
[58:07] raised from the dead just the same
[58:08] yesterday today and forever
[58:10] that's the generation that will receive
[58:12] it right
[58:13] all right let's continue on watchmen
[58:15] what of the night 1967-22
[58:18] oh you morning stars rise and shine it's
[58:19] time to shine the coming of the lord is
[58:21] at hand reflecting his presence
[58:23] reflecting the oncoming sun
[58:25] giving the same sign jesus said as it
[58:27] was in the days of sodom it'll be the
[58:29] same thing in the coming of the son of
[58:31] man
[58:32] the same ministry that the sun went down
[58:34] in
[58:35] s-o-n
[58:36] this s-o-n the same ministry
[58:39] so there it went down again
[58:42] down to the church ages what happened
[58:45] they eat away and eroded the word of god
[58:48] so much to where there was just enough
[58:50] light for people to squeeze in
[58:54] and get that son of god revelation that
[58:56] that was jesus christ and that man died
[58:58] for his sins and that had to be god
[58:59] because he rose again
[59:02] and he rose up and he come back to give
[59:04] you and i eternal life that's the life
[59:05] they had right right
[59:07] everybody with me okay
[59:09] not to do away with the son of man but
[59:11] that's the only revelation they had was
[59:12] to come as the son of god
[59:14] to give the people eternal life but he
[59:17] says the same ministry that the sun went
[59:19] down in
[59:20] the same light he went down in
[59:23] is coming again in the resurrection
[59:26] power and the morning star is reflecting
[59:28] that light
[59:30] then we cry watchman
[59:32] one of the night
[59:34] so what happened was down through the
[59:36] church ages
[59:37] he was buried under denominational
[59:39] creeds
[59:41] and our ideas amen
[59:45] that's what buried him
[59:47] but he was promised to come back in the
[59:49] end time because the son of man
[59:51] according to matthew 17 has to be risen
[59:54] again to see that vision which is what
[59:57] elijah moses and the son of man
[1:00:00] glorified amen
[1:00:03] only in this day do you have those three
[1:00:05] on the scene at almost the same time
[1:00:08] you have who you have elijah through
[1:00:10] brother branham bringing the message
[1:00:12] then you have elijah and moses going to
[1:00:14] the jews then you've got the glorified
[1:00:15] son of man which is his bride
[1:00:18] in that time
[1:00:19] glory you can't glorify the son of man
[1:00:21] if he's dead
[1:00:24] does everybody understand that the
[1:00:25] people that are in the grave right now
[1:00:28] from this present moment back
[1:00:31] got a revelation of the son of god
[1:00:34] that that man died for their sins and
[1:00:37] they are eternal now
[1:00:40] their flesh is in the ground but their
[1:00:42] soul is in the sixth dimension does
[1:00:43] everybody understand that they did not
[1:00:45] get the revelation of the son of man
[1:00:48] because the son of man cannot die
[1:00:51] he died one time the bible says for
[1:00:55] all right
[1:00:56] and the bible cannot
[1:00:58] duplicate itself or god can't go over
[1:01:00] his word
[1:01:02] and say well no i'll do it no he did it
[1:01:04] one time amen
[1:01:06] but we killed him
[1:01:08] in the spiritual form
[1:01:11] we killed that son of man revelation
[1:01:13] they just it just went down with all
[1:01:15] these creeds you don't have to do but
[1:01:16] what happened now
[1:01:18] all right we're at number 15.
[1:01:21] brother branham when he came
[1:01:24] i'm setting all this as a basis because
[1:01:27] a lot of people in the message and i
[1:01:29] don't some of you sitting here may be
[1:01:30] the same way
[1:01:32] do not see the importance of the seals
[1:01:36] but you have to have a revelation of the
[1:01:38] son of god first god's not going to
[1:01:40] speak to you any other way
[1:01:43] then what's inside of you
[1:01:45] but the revelation of the son of god is
[1:01:47] going to put you in a grave
[1:01:50] let's just be plain let's just talk
[1:01:52] plain tonight okay
[1:01:54] and just because you hear the message
[1:01:56] and you hear brother adam say son of man
[1:01:58] son of man you hear everybody preaching
[1:01:59] son of man son of man that's okay
[1:02:02] but unless that revelation comes to you
[1:02:07] then you're gonna go you're gonna die
[1:02:09] right
[1:02:10] you're gonna die you gotta die
[1:02:12] because you don't have enough revelation
[1:02:14] to bring that body to a change come on
[1:02:17] that's it
[1:02:19] and i said revelation right exactly okay
[1:02:21] to bring that that's why folks that and
[1:02:24] i'm and i was and i didn't go into
[1:02:26] detail like i did tonight with the with
[1:02:28] a sunday school class but if you don't
[1:02:30] get the son of god the difference
[1:02:32] between the son of god and the son of
[1:02:34] man dispensation or revelation i hate to
[1:02:36] say dispensation because that everybody
[1:02:38] puts things in a slide
[1:02:40] i just say revelation
[1:02:42] without the son of man revelation we're
[1:02:44] all going to die i don't care what your
[1:02:46] name is that's right
[1:02:49] that's why brother branham had to spend
[1:02:52] all the look at all the years he spent
[1:02:54] from 47 to 63 restoring back that son of
[1:02:59] god revelation pure enough
[1:03:02] to where god could come on the scene as
[1:03:04] the son of man and do the work
[1:03:07] just like the old testament prophet
[1:03:08] spent all those thousands of years doing
[1:03:10] what getting this earth ready for the
[1:03:13] son of man to come on the earth
[1:03:15] right
[1:03:16] they built the body they're the ones
[1:03:18] that set the platform brother brown said
[1:03:20] they they laid that foundation for that
[1:03:22] son of man to come on
[1:03:24] the whole old testament
[1:03:27] so it is now folks
[1:03:30] the son of man died one time amen but we
[1:03:33] killed him in our own ideas
[1:03:35] we killed him in our own denominational
[1:03:37] thinking
[1:03:39] and now
[1:03:42] let's declare that he's risen again amen
[1:03:45] but you can't just say it because that'd
[1:03:47] be just like ezekiel
[1:03:50] prophesy
[1:03:51] son of man right man
[1:03:54] what's he doing he's saying it's gonna
[1:03:56] happen to somebody else
[1:03:59] when you prophesy it's happening
[1:04:01] somewhere else
[1:04:03] but when you become the prophecy see
[1:04:05] jesus said this vision
[1:04:07] tell this vision in other words brother
[1:04:10] dean they were there in that vision
[1:04:13] and he was telling them he said tell
[1:04:15] this vision to no one
[1:04:18] right until the son of man be risen
[1:04:20] again
[1:04:21] peter james and john could have went and
[1:04:23] told that to a million people they would
[1:04:26] not have understand understood what
[1:04:28] happened on that mountain that day
[1:04:30] even peter saying now i got a more sure
[1:04:32] word of prophecy he stepped in that son
[1:04:35] of god revelation and saw that that was
[1:04:37] something going on but he couldn't put
[1:04:39] it together like we put it together
[1:04:41] he could put it together like this
[1:04:42] little prophet that brought this word of
[1:04:44] god and opened our eyes exactly
[1:04:49] but he spent turn to luke 17 and we'll
[1:04:51] finish
[1:04:52] he spent
[1:04:54] all that time
[1:04:56] because he had to bring back
[1:05:00] a group of people
[1:05:03] to the pure revelation of the son of god
[1:05:06] right
[1:05:08] exactly because part of it had been lost
[1:05:10] in father son and holy ghost baptism in
[1:05:13] eternal hell that they preach and all
[1:05:15] those things
[1:05:16] that was still under the son of god
[1:05:18] dispensation but in chapter you know we
[1:05:20] always read luke 17 30.
[1:05:24] but did you read the whole chapter
[1:05:27] because the whole chapter actually
[1:05:28] starting at verse 20
[1:05:30] and if you'll go back in your mind in in
[1:05:33] luke uh
[1:05:34] 17 20
[1:05:36] this actually even schofield doesn't
[1:05:38] pick this up that actually parallels
[1:05:40] matthew 24.
[1:05:42] yeah
[1:05:43] because you go to matthew 24 it says
[1:05:45] what
[1:05:46] low christ is here don't go because you
[1:05:48] know where he's at right then he says
[1:05:49] where the carcass is the eagle will be
[1:05:51] gathered right right talking about the
[1:05:53] son of man going from the east to the
[1:05:54] sunshine from the east to the west
[1:05:56] that's matthew 24.
[1:05:58] let's listen to this and see if this is
[1:06:00] not the same thing this is luke's
[1:06:02] part of it
[1:06:04] and when he was demanded of the
[1:06:06] pharisees when the kingdom of god should
[1:06:08] come
[1:06:10] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[1:06:12] god cometh not with observation
[1:06:14] neither shall they say lo here or low
[1:06:17] there for behold the kingdom of god is
[1:06:20] within you amen
[1:06:23] pretty strong statement but that's
[1:06:24] exactly what matthew 24 was saying
[1:06:27] lo here is christ remember they say lo
[1:06:29] here is christ over here over the sea
[1:06:31] but don't go there because he's not
[1:06:32] there you should know where he's at
[1:06:34] if you don't know where he's at you're
[1:06:35] going to go looking for it right all
[1:06:37] right
[1:06:39] that's why the foolish virgins were
[1:06:42] caught outside
[1:06:43] they went to look for something they
[1:06:45] didn't have
[1:06:46] all right
[1:06:47] and he said unto the disciples the day
[1:06:49] will come when you shall desire to see
[1:06:52] one
[1:06:55] of the days of the son of man and you
[1:06:57] shall not see it right
[1:07:01] and they shall say to you see here or
[1:07:03] see there go not after them nor follow
[1:07:06] them same as matthew 24
[1:07:08] for as the lightning that lighteth out
[1:07:10] of one part under heaven shineth unto
[1:07:13] the other part under heaven so shall
[1:07:15] also the son of man be in his day now
[1:07:16] remember matthew 24 says as the sun
[1:07:18] shineth from the east to the west right
[1:07:21] son of man revelation started in the
[1:07:23] east he was the son of man that's where
[1:07:25] he started
[1:07:26] then he come all the way to the to the
[1:07:28] west to where we're at now but first
[1:07:30] must he suffer many things and be
[1:07:32] rejected of this generation
[1:07:35] but and as it was in the days of noah so
[1:07:38] shall it be also in the days of the son
[1:07:40] of man now he's not talking about him
[1:07:42] standing there because there's not a
[1:07:43] flood coming
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:46] listen to this
[1:07:48] look at number 27. i want you to look
[1:07:50] pick up something
[1:07:52] they did eat
[1:07:53] they
[1:07:55] they married
[1:07:57] wives
[1:07:59] plural
[1:08:01] they didn't marry women
[1:08:03] they were marrying other people's wives
[1:08:06] plural
[1:08:08] now that's happening now
[1:08:10] in this day
[1:08:13] they were given in marriage until the
[1:08:15] day that noah entered into the ark and
[1:08:17] the flood came and destroyed them all
[1:08:19] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:08:21] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[1:08:23] they sold they planted they build them
[1:08:25] same as today but the same day that lot
[1:08:28] went out of sodom it rained fire
[1:08:29] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:08:31] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:08:34] when the son of man
[1:08:37] is revealed and that day he which shall
[1:08:39] be upon the house top and his stuff in
[1:08:41] the house let him not come down to take
[1:08:43] it away and he that's in the field let
[1:08:45] him likewise
[1:08:47] not return back right now we know what
[1:08:49] happened to that literally jesus was
[1:08:51] telling them
[1:08:52] to get out of the city right remember
[1:08:54] when titus was coming around the city he
[1:08:57] said don't you know he said in other
[1:08:58] words
[1:08:59] whatever you're doing your flight not be
[1:09:01] in the wintertime or you you know your
[1:09:02] women be pregnant and all that stuff
[1:09:04] that's what he's literally telling them
[1:09:05] but he's also telling us something all
[1:09:08] right remember lot's wife whosoever
[1:09:10] shall seek to save his life shall lose
[1:09:12] it whosoever shall lose his life shall
[1:09:14] preserve it
[1:09:16] i tell you in that night
[1:09:20] now brother brown said that was the
[1:09:21] darkness of night this this age i'll
[1:09:23] read the quote in just a second
[1:09:25] i'll tell you that in that night there
[1:09:27] shall be two men in one bed one should
[1:09:28] be taken the other shall be left
[1:09:30] two women shall be grinding together one
[1:09:32] shall be taken one left
[1:09:34] excuse me two men shall be in the field
[1:09:36] one taken one left and they said unto
[1:09:38] him
[1:09:39] prayer lord
[1:09:42] and he said unto them wheresoever the
[1:09:45] body is
[1:09:47] see there were the eagles
[1:09:49] together together now schofield picks
[1:09:51] that up like uh brother dale was talking
[1:09:53] about that
[1:09:54] says to see it armageddon
[1:09:57] but wheresoever the carcass of the body
[1:09:59] is therefore the eagle
[1:10:01] will be gathered together in other words
[1:10:03] in this day in this hour brother branham
[1:10:05] and abraham restored in long beach
[1:10:06] california in 1961 he said notice
[1:10:09] what was it god in human flesh
[1:10:12] and god would represent himself again in
[1:10:14] human flesh just before the coming of
[1:10:17] the son of man
[1:10:18] what flesh
[1:10:20] your flesh
[1:10:23] my flesh
[1:10:25] god coming now did you catch what he
[1:10:27] said
[1:10:28] let me read that again and god would
[1:10:30] represent himself again in human flesh
[1:10:33] just before
[1:10:36] the coming of the son of man right
[1:10:40] what flesh
[1:10:41] your flesh my flesh god coming down from
[1:10:44] heaven god longing for fellowship
[1:10:46] how people it seemed to be like there's
[1:10:48] so much mental theology about it you
[1:10:50] fail to get the discernment
[1:10:53] of the spirit now let me read one more
[1:10:55] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:10:56] and forever grand perry grand prairie
[1:10:59] alberta 1961.
[1:11:02] what did our lord say as it was in the
[1:11:04] days of sodom so shall it be in the
[1:11:06] coming of the son of man what the
[1:11:08] evening lights promised to the gentiles
[1:11:11] the same god that manifested himself
[1:11:13] there in a human body and disappeared in
[1:11:16] a moment that same god would manifest
[1:11:18] himself in a people
[1:11:20] human flesh in the form of the holy
[1:11:23] ghost
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:26] you can say the holy ghost in the form
[1:11:28] of human flesh
[1:11:29] right
[1:11:30] he said human flesh
[1:11:32] in the form of the holy ghost
[1:11:34] of believing people in the last days at
[1:11:37] the evening light jesus said so what to
[1:11:40] the gentiles the seed of abraham
[1:11:42] which was many nations
[1:11:45] jesus in the gospel had four titles we
[1:11:47] brought that out son of david air to the
[1:11:49] throne so of abraham the royal grant son
[1:11:51] of man heir of the earth son of god heir
[1:11:53] of all things the royal grant
[1:11:56] and the old testament property could not
[1:11:58] be held any longer than 50 years it
[1:12:00] could not be annihilated from its
[1:12:02] original owner but 50 years and on the
[1:12:04] 40th day he paid the price on the 50th
[1:12:07] day the redemption and the power that
[1:12:09] belonged to the church that was lost in
[1:12:11] the garden of eden
[1:12:14] right
[1:12:16] was redeemed back and sent to us by the
[1:12:18] baptism of the holy ghost on the 50th
[1:12:21] day
[1:12:22] all right
[1:12:24] so now
[1:12:26] a few things you bring the son of man
[1:12:28] dispensation
[1:12:29] bursts you into the body
[1:12:31] gets you into the kingdom of god
[1:12:35] but now there was a time
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:40] we must
[1:12:42] and i don't want to say move on from
[1:12:44] that but we need to move on from that
[1:12:50] not
[1:12:51] forgetting the foundation
[1:12:54] right but building on it and moving on
[1:12:56] right man
[1:12:58] we went around this mountain too many
[1:13:00] times
[1:13:02] i think it's time that we ought to be
[1:13:05] looking at the son of man in a
[1:13:07] revelation
[1:13:09] not like we've seen before yeah
[1:13:12] the seals came in 1963 i believe christ
[1:13:15] did come down in a cloud
[1:13:17] like those two men told the people said
[1:13:19] hey
[1:13:20] you see this man going up
[1:13:22] the only way you're going to see him is
[1:13:23] when he comes back in the cloud you saw
[1:13:25] him go up the cloud you're going to see
[1:13:26] him come back in the cloud
[1:13:27] see they missed that coming you and i
[1:13:29] are the only people that gets that
[1:13:30] coming but it's still we can say that
[1:13:34] we can say that
[1:13:37] but the revelation of those seals is the
[1:13:38] only thing that's going to change you
[1:13:40] know
[1:13:41] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:13:43] change our literal bodies brother brown
[1:13:45] said malachi 4 is to do two things
[1:13:47] remember one
[1:13:48] do just what i said bring the son of god
[1:13:51] dispensation back into power where all
[1:13:53] things are lined up straight
[1:13:55] where god can work in his church again
[1:13:57] amen all right but then what bring the
[1:14:00] mysteries of the seven thunders the
[1:14:01] things that man had never looked into
[1:14:03] and then that would literally turn us
[1:14:05] back
[1:14:06] remember preach that
[1:14:08] literal doesn't mean
[1:14:09] prophecy
[1:14:11] or prophesying of something it means you
[1:14:14] are it amen
[1:14:17] when it says literal that doesn't mean
[1:14:18] there's something coming
[1:14:20] that doesn't mean like a metaphor or or
[1:14:22] something that we're using as a type
[1:14:25] because you and i now
[1:14:27] if we're types
[1:14:33] because remember
[1:14:35] satan
[1:14:37] types after god
[1:14:40] and that's exactly what he's doing now
[1:14:42] and i wrote down the last thing
[1:14:45] please god don't let this be just head
[1:14:47] knowledge right yeah
[1:14:50] even born again
[1:14:51] i ain't talking about just sitting there
[1:14:53] without the new birth i'm talking about
[1:14:54] even born again let's don't let this be
[1:14:56] head knowledge
[1:14:58] because we're all getting older
[1:15:02] the fight's getting stronger
[1:15:05] but god's not getting any weaker right
[1:15:08] we may think he's gone but i think he's
[1:15:10] here
[1:15:12] but let's just not let this be head
[1:15:14] knowledge
[1:15:15] glory let's take this and look at it in
[1:15:17] a light we've never looked at it before
[1:15:20] i told the sun to class i said look i
[1:15:21] said i'm pretty plain most of the time
[1:15:23] and i'm going to be very plain if you're
[1:15:25] going to come to the sunday school class
[1:15:27] come every time
[1:15:29] if you're not don't
[1:15:31] because i'm not going to back up and
[1:15:32] have to review
[1:15:34] i've only got 30 minutes
[1:15:37] and i it's hard to review and then start
[1:15:38] over something and i'm not saying that
[1:15:41] but let me tell you something brother
[1:15:42] brown said one day your job will not be
[1:15:43] important right
[1:15:46] your job that's what he said
[1:15:48] your job won't even be important if your
[1:15:50] job gets in the way of the word of god
[1:15:52] then you need to get rid of your job
[1:15:54] got to give you a job
[1:15:56] i promise you he will he'll give you a
[1:15:57] job something will open up
[1:16:01] but what do we do
[1:16:04] what do we do
[1:16:08] we do the same thing we've been doing
[1:16:10] we just don't stop
[1:16:12] remember in the in the bible study if
[1:16:14] somebody was saying oh sister trudy was
[1:16:15] saying something she'd done and somebody
[1:16:18] was watching her and you know she's
[1:16:19] backslidden hey we all backslide brother
[1:16:21] i'm saying we backslide every day
[1:16:24] but if we do something wrong the the
[1:16:26] test of a true christian is is and you
[1:16:28] may have a lot of jobs accusers out
[1:16:30] there that see you fall
[1:16:32] but what they don't understand is is
[1:16:35] when you come back the next week
[1:16:37] and you're not doing what you did before
[1:16:40] right but you're have a repentant heart
[1:16:42] and you're thanking god for forgiving
[1:16:44] you your sins you know it's kind of hard
[1:16:46] i told the people one time
[1:16:48] one of the people at work i said you
[1:16:50] know man
[1:16:52] the kind of job that i do is
[1:16:55] very stressful and it's very thought
[1:16:58] invoking you have to think all the time
[1:17:01] because i'm actually doing three
[1:17:02] different jobs
[1:17:04] but
[1:17:05] i enjoy it
[1:17:07] but still
[1:17:08] if you make one mistake man is ready to
[1:17:10] fire you
[1:17:12] but
[1:17:14] if you make a mistake
[1:17:16] in god
[1:17:18] or it's like i told them i said you know
[1:17:19] you counsel people that are murderers
[1:17:21] and
[1:17:22] adulterers and
[1:17:23] and god forgive them
[1:17:26] i said we can't forgive somebody for
[1:17:28] writing a number down wrong
[1:17:30] i said but yeah you're going to church
[1:17:32] every day asking god to forgive you
[1:17:33] those hideous sins that you do and
[1:17:35] you're condemning a boy for writing a
[1:17:37] you know flipping the numbers from one
[1:17:39] to two it should have been 2-1
[1:17:42] i said what do you mean
[1:17:44] what kind of importance are we putting
[1:17:46] on all this
[1:17:47] i told them and i was just plain one day
[1:17:49] i said look all this that y'all think so
[1:17:52] important
[1:17:54] is one day gonna be
[1:17:56] dust and when this thing goes under
[1:18:00] it don't matter how much money you got
[1:18:02] it ain't gonna be worth nothing
[1:18:04] it's just a piece of paper
[1:18:07] so you can't serve god
[1:18:09] and man
[1:18:11] at the same time
[1:18:12] but we can understand
[1:18:14] going forward let's stand
[1:18:16] going forward
[1:18:19] let's
[1:18:21] let's realize
[1:18:22] that we need to know more about god
[1:18:26] excuse me let's realize that you know
[1:18:28] what
[1:18:29] there's more of god to know
[1:18:31] and let's realize that a prophet brother
[1:18:33] branham has already brought
[1:18:36] all that we need
[1:18:40] because let me give you a little key
[1:18:43] it really helped and that you know and
[1:18:46] uh
[1:18:47] sometimes you know you
[1:18:49] you think back on things and brother
[1:18:50] dean told me one time when i first
[1:18:52] started
[1:18:53] coming back to church he said you need
[1:18:55] to listen to those seal tapes
[1:18:58] he said that's a good foundation for you
[1:18:59] to start on he said you've got a good
[1:19:01] knowledge of the word he said in so many
[1:19:03] words we were talking to hunting you
[1:19:05] know
[1:19:05] before and i think god kind of
[1:19:07] vindicated us seeing deer and stuff
[1:19:09] anyway it was just something private
[1:19:10] between us
[1:19:12] but he said you know he said you need to
[1:19:13] listen to them those steel tapes you
[1:19:16] need to get a foundation you need to get
[1:19:17] some way to start
[1:19:19] and you know the first seal
[1:19:24] there's one mystery
[1:19:27] that's a mystery of iniquity
[1:19:29] that's knowing to do
[1:19:31] something
[1:19:32] right
[1:19:34] and you don't do it or knowing you're do
[1:19:36] some doing something wrong and you won't
[1:19:38] do something about it you can't go no
[1:19:40] further as a christian
[1:19:43] than that first field
[1:19:45] you can't go no further than that i've
[1:19:47] that stayed with me for for all these 10
[1:19:50] or 11 years that i've you know been a
[1:19:52] christian and in my walking god but you
[1:19:54] know what
[1:19:56] just be honest with you you try to talk
[1:19:57] to people about that and without a
[1:19:59] foundation they'll cut you off
[1:20:03] they don't know what you're talking
[1:20:03] about right
[1:20:06] well what do you mean the first seals
[1:20:08] when the seal was pulled back there was
[1:20:10] the antichrist riding riding away and i
[1:20:12] thought i thought yeah it ain't rolled
[1:20:14] away from you yet right
[1:20:17] born-again christians people i'm i want
[1:20:20] that to get that in your head
[1:20:21] we're not de-christianizing anybody
[1:20:25] right if you're if you have a revelation
[1:20:27] of the son of god and you're born again
[1:20:29] you're just as eternal as god is
[1:20:31] but you are going to die a natural death
[1:20:34] right somewhere somehow
[1:20:37] some way
[1:20:38] let's just look this thing right in the
[1:20:40] face
[1:20:41] unless we get a revelation of the seven
[1:20:44] seals and that thing becomes alive i sit
[1:20:47] alive in our life
[1:20:51] then we're going to have a lot of dirt
[1:20:52] pulled up
[1:20:56] sorry
[1:20:59] isn't that right people i mean that's
[1:21:00] the truth
[1:21:02] we know it's the truth in this church
[1:21:03] we've been taught
[1:21:05] but now it's time for us to live it that
[1:21:06] mystery of iniquity though can be done
[1:21:08] away by one thing
[1:21:10] confession amen
[1:21:12] and then move on to the next
[1:21:14] and then move on to the next and then
[1:21:16] move on to the next let's bow our heads
[1:21:18] just a second
[1:21:20] dear heavenly father we
[1:21:22] pray lord that as we sing the songs of
[1:21:25] zion that you'll come down lord and
[1:21:28] and not be just an onlooker lord but be
[1:21:30] an active participant in the rest of the
[1:21:32] service father
[1:21:33] we asked and pray that you would just
[1:21:35] keep the storm clouds back as we worship
[1:21:37] you lord and not have to worry about the
[1:21:39] roads being wet or
[1:21:41] or anything lord and all of us get home
[1:21:43] safe but i pray now that you would come
[1:21:46] among us lord in a special way that you
[1:21:47] would bring your power
[1:21:50] that scripture just keeps
[1:21:52] rolling in my head lord when you stood
[1:21:54] one day a mortal man
[1:21:57] that they went from mortality to
[1:21:58] immortality you were standing on the
[1:22:00] face of the earth right in the middle of
[1:22:02] satan's eden and screamed all power in
[1:22:05] heaven and earth's been given unto me
[1:22:08] and now i give it to a bride a church
[1:22:10] a people
[1:22:11] a people that i've longed to see father
[1:22:13] you've longed to see this day when you
[1:22:16] can reveal yourself in the most pure
[1:22:18] form
[1:22:19] not that you're not pure lord but our
[1:22:21] understanding sometimes have not been
[1:22:23] pure
[1:22:24] and the things that we've done in our
[1:22:26] life lord may it be a cleaning time that
[1:22:29] truly there won't be any iniquity in our
[1:22:31] heart
[1:22:32] there won't be anything lord that even
[1:22:35] father you told us that if we couldn't
[1:22:37] love our enemies
[1:22:39] that we couldn't get into your kingdom
[1:22:41] and father we pray lord that you would
[1:22:43] just bind all the powers of the
[1:22:45] principalities of the devil
[1:22:48] all the things that we do during the day
[1:22:50] that
[1:22:51] lord we need to ask forgiveness for that
[1:22:54] sometimes we let little things slip and
[1:22:56] slide and
[1:22:57] and see things maybe sometimes we're not
[1:22:59] supposed to lord we can't help the
[1:23:01] thoughts coming through our mind but
[1:23:03] lord jesus take them out and burn them
[1:23:06] lord send that cherubim that seraphim
[1:23:08] that seraphim down lord and let him burn
[1:23:10] that thing out of our mind lord
[1:23:13] cover us by your blood father we still
[1:23:15] need your blood until you come off that
[1:23:17] mercy seat father we still need the
[1:23:19] blood of jesus christ to cleanse us from
[1:23:22] all sin
[1:23:23] the father just blessed this group lord
[1:23:25] as we've seen it over the years people
[1:23:28] grow up lord we we sure lord want to see
[1:23:31] all of our children lord
[1:23:33] all of our brothers and our sisters and
[1:23:35] our family and our husbands and wives
[1:23:38] lord bound together by you lord not by
[1:23:41] a court of of discord or or some other
[1:23:45] thing that's come among us father we
[1:23:47] pray that that'll not happen lord that
[1:23:50] that we'll bind together in you father
[1:23:52] and get behind the pastor and be be good
[1:23:54] deacons and elders and and just be good
[1:23:57] people sitting in the pew father
[1:23:59] because we're the ones that operate your
[1:24:01] gift lord when the minister's standing
[1:24:02] here lord
[1:24:04] you're the one lord that that are
[1:24:06] standing here willing but sometimes we
[1:24:08] are not
[1:24:09] wanting maybe you to come in a service
[1:24:11] or we're got something in our mind to
[1:24:13] get somebody or against something or
[1:24:16] father i pray that when we come into a
[1:24:18] service from now on lord that we clean
[1:24:19] all those things out
[1:24:22] that will absolutely come in here with a
[1:24:24] heart that wants to learn lord that
[1:24:26] something that we want to absolutely
[1:24:29] with the adoration of our heart we want
[1:24:32] to learn more about you father and not
[1:24:34] it just be head knowledge lord you know
[1:24:36] as i wrote that last
[1:24:38] sentence down on the paper lord
[1:24:41] father i pray that it will not be head
[1:24:44] knowledge
[1:24:46] it'll be something that when
[1:24:48] when our
[1:24:50] eyes look at the word of god that
[1:24:53] we'll see you lord
[1:24:56] and not see just a bunch of words on a
[1:24:58] page or
[1:24:59] or
[1:25:00] something in a book or or
[1:25:03] god forbid to say brother branham said
[1:25:06] this and said that
[1:25:08] but lord let it be something that's
[1:25:10] alive in our heart
[1:25:12] because you didn't say if brother
[1:25:13] branham spoke to the mountain you told
[1:25:15] us if we spoke to the mountain
[1:25:18] that it would be move father
[1:25:20] you know lord that in my heart i don't
[1:25:23] say that as being meaningful toward
[1:25:25] brother branham he was the great prophet
[1:25:27] that came to bring us this lord but he's
[1:25:29] gone now
[1:25:31] and we have his voice now among a group
[1:25:33] of people
[1:25:34] and father you told john to take that
[1:25:36] book and eat it
[1:25:38] and oh it would be sweet as honey when
[1:25:40] we ate it but oh when we tried to live
[1:25:42] it it'd be real hard and bitter in our
[1:25:44] belly lord
[1:25:46] but you told us and we took the book and
[1:25:48] we did eat it
[1:25:49] father there's a group of people i
[1:25:51] believe standing on the earth today
[1:25:52] that's going to see that coming that you
[1:25:54] were talking about lord that you're
[1:25:56] going to come among the church so
[1:25:58] visible
[1:26:00] that you're going to raise the dead and
