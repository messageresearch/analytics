[13:46] guide us now in Jesus name
[13:51] amen Romans I mean Matthew 19
[13:57] 3-9 and then we'll go to Romans 7
[14:01] 1-6 and the Pharisees came unto him
[14:04] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[14:06] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[14:08] for every cause and he answered and said
[14:10] unto them have you not read that he
[14:13] which made them at the beginning made
[14:15] them male and female and said for this
[14:17] cause shall a man leave his father and
[14:19] his mother and shall cleave to his wife
[14:21] and they shall be twain shall twne they
[14:25] twine shall be one flesh wherefore there
[14:27] are no more twine but one flesh what
[14:29] therefore God ha joined together let not
[14:32] man put a
[14:35] under and they say unto him why did
[14:37] Moses then command to give a writing a
[14:39] divorce and to put her away he saith
[14:42] unto them Moses because of the hardness
[14:44] of your hearts suffered you to put away
[14:46] your wives but from the beginning it was
[14:48] not so and I say unto you whosoever
[14:51] shall put away his wife except it be for
[14:53] fornication and shall marry another
[14:55] commit adultery who so Marth her which
[14:58] is put away way does commit
[15:01] adultery all right go to Romans
[15:05] 7 verse one know ye brethren for I speak
[15:08] to them that know the law how that the
[15:10] law which law ha dominion over a man as
[15:13] long as he liveth for the
[15:16] law watch the law as long as he liveth
[15:19] for the woman which hath an husband is
[15:21] bound by the law to her husband so long
[15:24] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[15:27] she is loose from the law of her husb
[15:29] husband now that this is written Paul
[15:32] see you got the
[15:33] law that had dominion over a man that's
[15:36] the natural all right then you got this
[15:39] is a law of the marriage and wife see
[15:43] all right everybody following me see
[15:45] verse Two for the one which ha a husband
[15:47] is bound by the law to her husband now
[15:49] that's that's fine with the law bound
[15:52] with it but it's really the law of bound
[15:54] or husband that's more stronger than the
[15:57] the natural law of the land you know all
[16:00] right so long as he liveth but if the
[16:02] husband be dead she is loose from the
[16:04] law of her husband so then if while her
[16:06] husband liveth she' be married to
[16:08] another man she shall be called an
[16:09] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[16:12] she is free from that law so that she is
[16:14] no adulterous though she be married to
[16:16] another man wherefore my brethren ye
[16:20] also are become dead to the law now he's
[16:23] coming right back over to the art part
[16:25] of the law right by the body of Christ
[16:28] that you should be married to another
[16:30] even to him who is raised from the dead
[16:32] that you should bring forth fruit unto
[16:34] God for when we were in the flesh the
[16:37] Motions of sin which were by the law did
[16:39] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[16:41] under death but now we are delivered
[16:43] from the law that being dead wherein we
[16:45] were held that we should serve in
[16:47] newness of spirit and not in the oldness
[16:50] of the letter you may be seated the Lord
[16:53] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[16:56] word now we're going to be covering a
[17:00] large area this
[17:03] afternoon and if I get down so far and I
[17:06] see that it's going to take too much
[17:08] time we will just cut off and go uh and
[17:12] wait until finishing it wind state but
[17:16] now we're going to have three things in
[17:21] mind all right now that's the reason I
[17:23] ask you to read the marriage and divorce
[17:27] and to read The Invisible ible Union all
[17:30] right now especially in the invisible
[17:33] Union you will find three things that
[17:37] brother brandom is
[17:39] covering all right he is going to be
[17:43] covering the new
[17:45] birth how that you must be born again
[17:51] right he does a covers a lot in that all
[17:55] right then he will be covering
[17:59] and using the illustration there that
[18:01] you must be dead to be born again you
[18:03] must die and come forth you know all
[18:06] right then he goes into the illustration
[18:08] of like the grace of marriage and
[18:11] divorce right how that your old husband
[18:14] must be
[18:15] dead you know before you can be married
[18:18] to uh the second husband and it' be okay
[18:22] and be legal about it cuz he's speaking
[18:25] about the church or for the women see to
[18:28] do basically on the line but the men are
[18:31] covered in it but now all right then the
[18:33] L is what he calls and we'll read it
[18:35] here in just a moment he says that this
[18:38] Romans 7 is a greater
[18:42] portion of marriage and divorce all
[18:46] right a greater portion of marriage and
[18:50] divorce which I've told you this morning
[18:52] and I've always preached it this way
[18:54] since many many years ago and seeing it
[18:57] that you know most everybody can talk
[18:59] about the grace of marriage and divorce
[19:01] for the natural act and things and they
[19:03] think that that's all they need right
[19:06] well uh you know I don't I believe that
[19:09] as I said this morning you have Moses
[19:11] giving the natural then you had Paul
[19:14] giving a natural and spiritual
[19:17] application applying it typing it and
[19:20] then you had brother Brandon to come in
[19:22] with the point of the uh spiritual part
[19:26] picking it up and taking it back to a
[19:28] natural point to carry us into the
[19:33] millennial Reign and eternities and
[19:34] herea see in a glorified this glorified
[19:38] body not a new body not something else
[19:41] is this because we're going you know we
[19:44] have to see that that's capable of being
[19:46] redeemed all right now so then if we
[19:48] covering it this afternoon remember that
[19:52] thought and when we're reading keep your
[19:54] mind let it go with the thought I'll try
[19:57] my best to to
[19:59] emphasize uh the point going through of
[20:03] what's being said but uh you know I want
[20:05] you to think of it that way that you'll
[20:08] hear Brother random talking about that
[20:09] we've got to be dead to the world right
[20:12] all right and that's that's that's good
[20:15] because that's the new birth that's
[20:17] right all right we have to cover that
[20:19] away all right next he will be speaking
[20:21] of our old denominational husband
[20:25] right that even after we were born again
[20:28] we were still tied up in organized
[20:31] religion you know and maybe it still are
[20:34] today because if our old husband is
[20:36] still
[20:36] alive then uh you know uh it has to be
[20:40] dealt with right and then he's covering
[20:44] the the natural of marriage and divorce
[20:46] because he covers that that that husband
[20:49] you know the old husband has got to be
[20:51] dead before the woman can be married
[20:53] again right so keep these things in your
[20:55] mind and just kind of watch it as you go
[20:57] through and if you if you you miss it
[20:59] then you know just pick it up and and
[21:01] say well okay we're in one of these
[21:04] stages cuz each one will be related
[21:07] that's why I've tried to to figure out
[21:10] which way and for many many years I've U
[21:14] tried to preach on this and have many
[21:16] times but uh you know trying to find a a
[21:20] way to present it to a word that can be
[21:24] understood yes you say well we just we
[21:27] just accept the grace of Mar and divorce
[21:30] well what about the old husband the
[21:31] denomination that's right what do you
[21:34] mean I left that a long time ago brother
[21:37] R said
[21:38] not to divorce him or hang him up in a
[21:42] closet that's right
[21:45] right he got to be
[21:48] dead right yeah but Brother D I never
[21:51] was in a organization or a denomination
[21:54] he's born
[21:55] one that's right solves a problem right
[21:58] no matter where you ever went to a
[22:00] church or what you born
[22:03] denominationalism we were born to our
[22:05] adulterous parent Eve amen and her acts
[22:09] and the things of what took place all
[22:11] right so then the best thing to do is
[22:13] just to to listen and then say
[22:16] okay now this is what is want I'm
[22:19] wanting to get right here and let me
[22:22] understand all right cuz like we were
[22:24] talking about this morning a
[22:25] supernatural
[22:26] Revelation all revelation is
[22:29] Supernatural now I made a statement they
[22:32] said at the end which I didn't mean to
[22:34] make it that way but two sisters said I
[22:37] did so okay I said that Cain had a
[22:40] supernatural Revelation well I didn't
[22:42] mean it that way if I meant Cain had a
[22:46] revelation because he had a revelation
[22:49] like the denominate Nations has got a
[22:50] revelation they got a revelation of the
[22:52] Trinity yes right but it ain't no true
[22:55] Revelation it's not a supernatural
[22:57] revelation right I was trying to do and
[23:00] if my mind see when you're up here your
[23:02] mind's going to and your brain and your
[23:04] head and you're trying to get it all
[23:07] together and and trying to bring it down
[23:09] to where people can follow it so if I
[23:11] said that statement in there and I'm
[23:13] sure I did because they called it to my
[23:15] attention I meant to say that Cain got a
[23:19] revelation but not a revelation from God
[23:23] right see if he had got it from God it
[23:26] would have been a supernatural
[23:27] Revelation right all right because all
[23:29] Revelation then is Supernatural right
[23:32] the reveal word of God but what we think
[23:35] is a revelation see people say I like I
[23:38] said this more people say why it's been
[23:39] revealed to me there's a
[23:42] trinity well where did it come
[23:44] from it had to come from the devil
[23:47] that's right it's surely not a
[23:49] supernatural Revelation out of the word
[23:50] of God because there's no such thing in
[23:52] the word of God
[23:53] Amen see you say but brother Dale you
[23:56] you mean I didn't have I well
[23:59] why you upset you know watch the what
[24:02] you know the flutter of the you know of
[24:07] the being back when somebody says
[24:09] something that sometimes it proves that
[24:11] we we're wrong you know and we need help
[24:14] all right but see a supernatural
[24:17] Revelation the word of God being
[24:20] revealed unto us is a supernatural
[24:24] Revelation it brings a supernatural God
[24:27] we read this morning to Earth into the
[24:31] individual to be with us as a
[24:33] supernatural God in a supernatural
[24:35] people and you know that's what we are
[24:38] by the new birth we are the supernatural
[24:41] people of God all right now try to get
[24:45] that and then we'll go on but remember
[24:47] now I want to keep stating it see we're
[24:49] going to have to be dealing with three
[24:52] things so if I cross over somewhere in
[24:55] it he you know try to get it in the
[24:58] right place and talk to me later about
[25:01] it and so you say well brother D you
[25:03] said so and so well I was applying it to
[25:06] this you know and and this is what I
[25:09] talking about here number one see all
[25:12] you're thinking on number three and and
[25:14] see it it'll go backwards and forward so
[25:16] forgive me I I've been trying to find a
[25:19] way for I said for 40 40 years to
[25:23] express into human
[25:26] terminologies what a prophet was trying
[25:28] trying to do of of telling us about
[25:31] these things all right
[25:33] now this came to pass on this part of it
[25:36] because a question was asked that I said
[25:39] I would try to cover
[25:40] today that a question was asked that we
[25:43] didn't cover this past Wednesday and the
[25:46] question is how do you
[25:49] know that you
[25:51] know that your denominational husband is
[25:56] dead now how you
[26:00] know that your old denominational
[26:02] husband is
[26:04] dead
[26:06] okay now how do you
[26:09] know that you're free in the grace of
[26:12] marriage and
[26:18] divorce how do you know that you're born
[26:21] [Music]
[26:24] again see they all have to tie together
[26:27] to make a beautiful picture that's right
[26:29] one can't be going this way and another
[26:31] one that way and that's just you know it
[26:33] has to come together to make a beautiful
[26:36] picture amen because it's just in other
[26:40] words if if you got the new
[26:43] birth and you
[26:46] know that that old nature and old things
[26:49] is dead and
[26:51] gone all right and you're born
[26:54] again then you're capable of moving up
[26:57] to the next step that's right which
[26:59] would be into the basis of of a
[27:02] spiritual condition see to find out how
[27:05] you're old denominational husband see
[27:07] that's where people thinks they think
[27:09] the day they got born
[27:12] again that that covered
[27:15] everything but it doesn't that's right I
[27:18] was trying to find a quote last night I
[27:19] know brother R made it but it's you know
[27:21] how it is with the computer you got to
[27:23] get the exact wording but one time he
[27:25] made a statement like this he said we
[27:27] are free by the blood of Jesus
[27:30] Christ he said but we're Bound by our by
[27:33] our Creeds and ideas and doctrines or
[27:35] something my that right that's right
[27:38] brother you said oh no I'm
[27:41] free well why is the old husband showing
[27:44] up every once in a while right you
[27:47] know I mean if he was naturally married
[27:50] you know and you had an old husband and
[27:52] he started coming back every a while and
[27:53] the neighbors could see him you know
[27:55] they'd say well hey you know you got a
[27:57] problem problem because that was the guy
[28:00] that you divorced or something he keep
[28:02] showing up well if that's the way it is
[28:04] in the natural what about in the
[28:07] spiritual how do we know we're born
[28:12] again how do we know that her old
[28:15] denominational husband is
[28:18] dead how do we know the grace of
[28:21] marriage and divorce is applied to
[28:25] us now you see why I was putting the
[28:27] emphas this morning on his Supernatural
[28:29] Revelation yes right all right but the
[28:33] emphasis was upon hoping you was getting
[28:35] it one thing that you say well brother
[28:38] Brandon said it was a supernatural
[28:39] Revelation because of the opening of The
[28:41] Seven Seals All right but was that
[28:44] something contrary to the
[28:47] Bible no it had to be what the Bible was
[28:49] talking about it had to be in the word
[28:52] that's right you know when he T cut the
[28:54] top off the pyramid and looked down in
[28:56] there and he saw things that light had
[28:57] never shine
[28:59] don't but it had to be part of the word
[29:02] they said brother ROM you can do this or
[29:04] do that he sit there trying to trap me
[29:05] he said cuz you can't add to the Bible
[29:09] That's So then now the point that I was
[29:11] making this
[29:14] morning people as I said they'll hold up
[29:17] a spoken word hold up a marriage and
[29:19] divorce but boy bless God I believe the
[29:21] grace is right here in this book where
[29:23] the Prophet said it but now I don't
[29:26] believe it's other things he said
[29:32] well now where are you at
[29:35] right now we look at that as
[29:38] denominationalism and things out there
[29:40] right and I just finished the series
[29:43] preaching on the the doctrines and
[29:45] things among the people of this
[29:48] message that I didn't agree
[29:51] with but see I don't see how in the
[29:54] world you can take a two Soul Doctrine
[29:56] and come out with a an an understanding
[29:58] of one true and living God that's right
[30:01] how can you take a two Lord Doctrine and
[30:04] come out to be an understanding of one
[30:06] true and living God that's right how can
[30:08] you take the uh that Jesus wasn't God to
[30:10] the River Jordan and stuff like that how
[30:13] can you do that and come out with an
[30:15] understanding of one true and living
[30:17] God so then the the people are denying
[30:20] what brother Ram
[30:24] said and see their old husband is still
[30:26] alive amen CU her old husband was the
[30:29] doctrin just like the two Souls is a
[30:31] Mormon Doctrine I proved that 40 years
[30:34] ago there is a Doctrine come down from
[30:37] the Mormon Church down and filtered into
[30:39] the message not from Brother random no
[30:41] way
[30:43] right and see then you see all of these
[30:45] brothers coming out with their own
[30:46] Doctrine their own ways then it goes to
[30:49] prove that their old husband's not dead
[30:51] right but now that's no problem of mine
[30:54] you know what right you know what I'm
[30:56] concerned about
[30:58] is my old
[31:00] husband that's right right
[31:03] see you know cuz it'll it'll come down
[31:07] that you'll see our old husband is just
[31:09] her own ideas that's right I hope that
[31:12] gets to you it's just our own ideas
[31:15] amen see that becomes denominationalism
[31:18] just as M much as it would be if we had
[31:19] a great big steeple out front out here
[31:21] and had our nebor the call you know
[31:24] whatever but see now that's what I'm
[31:26] wanting you to see and what we want to
[31:28] get started on so it's so you'll see the
[31:30] point okay brother Anderson pull up to
[31:33] the number one on the quote now there we
[31:35] got a lot in here I think I have eight
[31:39] pages and some of this is all is a and
[31:42] when you see you don't see it on there
[31:44] but what I'm looking at says when I look
[31:46] and see it when that line is on the side
[31:49] that means it's a continuation of
[31:51] reading paragraph after paragraph after
[31:54] paragraph see all right so then you know
[31:57] we'll we'll cover so look what he said
[31:59] this is taken from paragraph 35
[32:02] invisible Union right of
[32:05] Christ preaching 65 11:25 and basically
[32:09] almost every quote except three today
[32:10] will be out of that all
[32:12] right Paul is given an illustration in
[32:16] our scripture now he's read Romans
[32:18] 7 coming down in his thought all
[32:22] right about the law and Grace and
[32:26] illustrating it black marriage and
[32:29] divorce now watch it this passage is
[32:33] very seldom preached
[32:35] on because it more or less pertains to
[32:39] like marriage and
[32:41] divorce all right
[32:44] now but it also pertains to a greater
[32:48] portion of marriage and
[32:51] divorce a greater
[32:56] portion so then this that we're going to
[32:58] get on here is going to be a greater
[33:02] portion that's all
[33:06] right so if if marriage and divorce was
[33:09] a great portion what is what is
[33:11] invisible Union that's right right right
[33:14] and I like the title you know you ever
[33:16] thought about it the invisable union of
[33:19] the bride of Christ
[33:22] amen doesn't say the invisible Union of
[33:25] the bride with Christ that's right
[33:29] am it's the invisible Union of the bride
[33:32] of Christ right coming together
[33:36] here before we go there all right but
[33:38] look what he says but it also pertains
[33:41] to a greater portion of marriage and
[33:44] divorce of how that he's trying to set
[33:47] in order here that we as as a church can
[33:51] no be no can no more be married to the
[33:54] world and to Christ at the same time and
[33:58] and be legal and lawful about it then it
[34:00] can be for a woman to be living with a
[34:02] husband while she's got a living husband
[34:05] and I have my own thoughts of that
[34:07] remember he was out in Louisiana when he
[34:08] was doing this uh preaching it so he
[34:10] said I have my own thoughts of that and
[34:13] I believe that what the Bible says is
[34:15] true but now I believe also is to my
[34:19] belief that it unfolds one of the great
[34:23] mysteries of
[34:25] prophecies now look at that
[34:29] and I hope that the Lord will help us
[34:31] tonight as we deliver this to our
[34:33] waiting people across the country p r o
[34:37] p h e c
[34:42] y
[34:46] prophecy p r o p h e s y is
[34:54] prophesy okay
[34:57] prophesy is speaking it right right
[35:04] prophecy is a setting in order of
[35:06] scriptures
[35:08] right that's what I said 40 years ago
[35:10] I'm still even looking back at my notes
[35:12] time I still have them matter of
[35:16] fact and Richard then working on putting
[35:19] the entire message that we preached from
[35:22] here that's been brought from here since
[35:25] 882 onto the internet
[35:28] amen so then you'll see if you want to
[35:30] go back there and check to see if I'm
[35:31] right you'll find out I preached
[35:33] marriage and divorce probably about five
[35:34] times since then at least at many all
[35:37] right well look then it unfolds one of
[35:40] the great mysteries of
[35:42] Prophecy one of the great Mysteries of
[35:46] the word of
[35:48] God being
[35:52] unveiled setting in order the scriptures
[35:58] and bringing it to a place to have the
[36:01] word of God that was supposed to be
[36:04] right see that's not prophesy that's not
[36:07] de it's prophecy it's the setting and
[36:10] Order of scriptures bringing it to a
[36:12] position to see and understand what
[36:16] we're talking about but get to point now
[36:18] as we go along because we'll we'll keep
[36:20] referring back this is a greater portion
[36:22] of marriage and divorce
[36:25] right all right you say well boy bless
[36:27] God I thank God for the grace amen so do
[36:30] I but there was a lot more happened that
[36:32] day than what people was thinking about
[36:35] right amen the day the prophet gave the
[36:38] grace of marriage and
[36:40] divorce you know we know it was not him
[36:43] it was God speaking through him to the
[36:46] people no more than it was Moses it was
[36:48] God in it was Christ in Moses that was
[36:51] speaking to the people the grace of
[36:54] marriage and divorce it was Christ in
[36:56] Paul that was speaking in the grace of
[36:58] marriage and divorce and it was Christ
[37:00] and brother random to bring that to the
[37:02] church all right but just think about
[37:04] what he could stand there and
[37:07] see and see like I said most everybody
[37:10] they just want the
[37:12] part of where he said that you know I
[37:16] can read it to you he
[37:19] said I'm free well
[37:22] amen but now what about the invisible
[37:24] Union of your old husband well now leave
[37:27] that alone
[37:29] cuz there was a lot of people in this
[37:31] message and I can call names that when
[37:33] brother around passed away a lot of the
[37:35] people that you hear Brother randam
[37:37] calling their
[37:39] names wound up back in organized
[37:44] religion no literally went back to
[37:46] organize religion
[37:48] amen after all he said about those
[37:53] things that he calls them brothers
[37:59] right so listen Church which is which is
[38:02] the part that we
[38:04] need what just need the grace just tell
[38:06] us about the grace brother Dale I now I
[38:09] want to just ask you a question this is
[38:11] just simple old brother Dale but this
[38:14] is this is what's bothered me for 40
[38:17] years so I want you to express
[38:20] it and I'm
[38:24] serious what happened
[38:29] in the marital
[38:32] situations what actually took place
[38:35] there when the prophet said I say go on
[38:39] as you
[38:44] are what literally took place right
[38:51] right what did God do
[38:59] you never thought of that I guess I'm
[39:02] the only one that's made that
[39:06] way like I've always said I will not put
[39:08] my mind to working on cars or anything
[39:11] because I will tied up into that and I
[39:14] would just set it to do that to do that
[39:17] to do that you know and everybody knows
[39:20] it works with me I I don't talk when I'm
[39:24] working because I'm thinking and hard
[39:27] for me to think and
[39:30] talk now that's not hard for a lot of
[39:32] people to do seemingly but it's hard for
[39:35] me to work and think and I'm up on a
[39:38] ladder and timbo's down on the ground
[39:41] and he's talking away to me and I
[39:43] measure a Bard is 36 and
[39:46] 3/4 most of you that records in there
[39:49] you don't have to worry about it don't
[39:50] with me I'm sorry I come down off the
[39:53] ladder I'm thinking about what he said I
[39:55] come down was that 33 and 3/4
[39:59] 3 back up the ladder I
[40:04] go and I take me a piece of
[40:08] board no I'm sorry that's just the way I
[40:11] am I'm sorry cuz I have a one track mind
[40:13] that's for wife she'll tell you in a
[40:14] hurry she's shaking her head on you turn
[40:17] around her look at her if you want to
[40:18] she's Shing her head
[40:20] on
[40:21] but I think like
[40:24] that but you know better than to tackle
[40:27] me on what I'm thinking on that point
[40:29] because on that point I got it right you
[40:31] know I'm in the in the right mood on
[40:33] that point see so then you know let's
[40:37] don't lock down now
[40:39] church on one
[40:42] thing and not move on into
[40:46] others and the people have done it
[40:48] literally on saying the grace of
[40:50] marriage and divorce and they never
[40:52] thought that he was talking anything
[40:54] about their old husband of organized
[40:56] religion
[41:00] all it was is just straight down the
[41:02] line the way people think that's right
[41:06] marriage and divorce
[41:09] Grace they don't see that he was talking
[41:11] about organized religion and how we were
[41:13] married to that what was the reason
[41:15] marriage and divorce had to be
[41:18] [Music]
[41:19] preached what do we read this
[41:22] morning what is in marriage and divorce
[41:24] there when it's coming down what
[41:27] because of misinterpreted
[41:33] theology because of our old husbands
[41:37] right right that are still
[41:40] alive our old denominational
[41:43] ideas amen oh no they won't put up a
[41:47] sign on a church in this message and say
[41:49] we denominated it but brother R said
[41:51] they'll organize it in the lady OA
[41:55] right do you know that they is just one
[41:57] step between organize and
[42:04] denominate that's just one step between
[42:06] the two between an organization or a
[42:10] denomination all right so then listen to
[42:13] what I'm saying if it takes me longer I
[42:14] don't mind waiting on Wednesday or
[42:16] waiting on y if you want to stay at 5:00
[42:18] this afternoon whatever you want to
[42:20] do it doesn't really matter to me
[42:22] because I just try my best to present
[42:24] what I
[42:25] can to you get you to see and get you to
[42:29] think see most people never they don't
[42:32] even think that they have to have a
[42:34] spiritual application to their their
[42:35] marriage and
[42:38] divorce their old husband their old
[42:40] denominational husband's still alive
[42:42] that's right yep and all that takes is
[42:46] our ideas that's
[42:49] right and see if I stand right here now
[42:52] you just probably you won't like this
[42:54] statement which is all right but if me
[42:56] or any preacher stands and proves by the
[42:59] word of
[43:00] God that something that you used to
[43:04] believe is
[43:08] wrong and you stay with that wrong your
[43:12] old husband is still
[43:15] alive okay now that's how do you
[43:19] know that you
[43:22] know how do you know that you know your
[43:24] old denominational husband is dead right
[43:29] [Music]
[43:32] cuz if he's still alive he'll show his
[43:35] head
[43:37] right the old boy is going to come
[43:39] around every once in a while and he's
[43:42] going to show
[43:44] his so then I believe we need a
[43:48] spiritual application a greater
[43:53] portion than he gave in The Invisible
[43:55] Union of marriage and
[43:58] divorce I believe we need the greater
[44:01] portion right to be able to come to a
[44:05] position to where we can walk out of
[44:07] this Earth
[44:09] Amen in these bodies we're in amen right
[44:13] without taking to death that's
[44:16] right so easy to understand that if you
[44:19] die you die that's right
[44:23] yeah I mean my daddy died in 1945 he you
[44:26] can't write down on something that he
[44:28] killed somebody 2 days ago or a week ago
[44:30] or something you know it's just just
[44:33] foolishness to
[44:35] think but you know our old husband can
[44:38] be dead that we just hung him up in a
[44:44] closet you never heard people say this I
[44:48] know so and so but I've got my own
[44:55] idea right yes
[44:58] I got my own
[45:00] idea well let me translate that back
[45:03] about 6,000 years
[45:05] ago when there was a lady said
[45:11] that you don't don't
[45:15] uh I know I talk wrong Sor
[45:19] sorry you think Eve didn't think it was
[45:21] wrong to have a relationship with that
[45:23] Beast there's something wrong with your
[45:25] mentality if you think that she didn't
[45:28] her first thoughts was strictly against
[45:32] that now come on she was pure and holy
[45:35] and virtuous and righteous and
[45:40] everything see don't matter if you want
[45:42] to say it with eating an
[45:45] apple it still be that sure you know she
[45:47] thought about
[45:50] it but see then after a while that
[45:54] that new husband standing there begin to
[45:58] inject his idea into her that's right
[46:02] and as he did she wound up doing the
[46:06] natural act
[46:08] right I don't say she was a filthy
[46:10] garbage
[46:13] can no she become
[46:18] that so now we got to get back so let's
[46:20] let's go on see if we can so then
[46:23] remember now we're talking about a
[46:24] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[46:27] coming from the opening of the
[46:29] scriptures we're talking about the
[46:31] natural marriage and divorce the
[46:34] grace the new birth to bring us to
[46:36] Christ the the marriage and divorce
[46:38] situation to set us physically free and
[46:42] the the greater portion of marriage and
[46:44] divorce involved in the invisible Union
[46:47] of our old denominational husbands got
[46:49] to be dead that's right and in doing
[46:50] that then we're seeing that it's a a
[46:53] mystery of a setting in order of the
[46:56] Prophecies of the scripture the prophet
[46:58] said that we just read
[47:00] amen
[47:01] right do you think Moses law now as I
[47:05] said something this morning about the
[47:08] the thing uh Moses the the grace he
[47:12] gave when Paul came along why didn't
[47:15] Paul just repeat
[47:21] Moses see because Paul's message was a
[47:25] greater portion right right deeper depth
[47:28] higher level more word Moses was a
[47:31] natural Paul was a natural and spiritual
[47:34] application Amen to be married to Christ
[47:38] that's right all right what do you think
[47:40] in this end time it
[47:42] is to be married to Christ the
[47:45] word all right in our headship see to
[47:48] unite all right now in doing it it sets
[47:51] in order the
[47:54] scriptures see the prophecy of the the
[47:57] mystery sets in order the
[47:59] scriptures in other words it's lining up
[48:01] the
[48:02] scriptures but now you remember what I
[48:04] said I said Moses Grace that Paul
[48:08] couldn't just quote Moses our brother
[48:11] Brandon quoting
[48:12] Paul that's right it had to be something
[48:14] personal to each individual to bring the
[48:17] grace that's and and Moses Grace was not
[48:21] sufficient in the days of Paul right or
[48:24] Paul would have requoted Moses that's
[48:26] right neither would it be of Mo of
[48:28] Paul's Grace to be sufficient or p r
[48:32] would have quoted Paul that's right you
[48:35] understand each one of them kept
[48:37] unfolding into a deeper portion of the
[48:40] word are the setting and Order of the
[48:42] scriptures bringing it to a place to
[48:45] see now watch this part
[48:49] though Moses Grace was the word of God
[48:54] the alive word the supernatural
[48:55] Revelation that spoke that's right right
[48:58] the Christ speaking through Moses you
[49:01] agree all right well then see it
[49:04] couldn't be a different thing then right
[49:08] I tried to use the words if I don't use
[49:10] my words correctly forgive me I don't
[49:11] how the
[49:12] education Moses's Grace wouldn't have
[49:15] been sufficient for Paul it had to be
[49:17] more cuz there's more word unveiling but
[49:20] Moses's Grace was speaking of the grace
[49:23] that Paul brought that's right
[49:27] are you listening it was speaking of
[49:29] that that Paul brought into being all
[49:32] right so would Paul's message then of
[49:34] the grace speak of the end time when the
[49:36] prophet would bring the grace so it
[49:38] can't be something different right amen
[49:41] Paul's Grace wasn't something different
[49:43] from Moses right brother around his
[49:46] grace that we just talking using those
[49:48] terms wouldn't something different from
[49:51] Moses and Paul it was greater portion
[49:55] right
[49:57] deeper depth greater things had to come
[49:59] into being Paul wasn't concerned with a
[50:01] change of a body that's
[50:04] right it wasn't time that's
[50:08] right Moses wasn't concerned with a body
[50:11] change right we're concerned with a body
[50:14] change here in the end
[50:16] time see all right are you following me
[50:18] then yes see now let's start doing that
[50:22] then with that in the background to to
[50:25] read a little go ahead to number two
[50:26] brother
[50:29] this is paragraph 56 and 57 of the
[50:32] invisible
[50:34] union now watching the prophet Paul is
[50:39] saying that a woman cannot remarry until
[50:41] her first husband is dead she cannot
[50:44] remarry as long as her first husband is
[50:47] living all right she by no circumstances
[50:50] at
[50:51] all okay we've been through all of this
[50:54] right yes she must remain single as long
[50:57] as her her first husband is
[51:01] living all right we even went through
[51:03] you know that she could say well you
[51:06] know like this lady trying to collect
[51:09] insurance over here on the Bel and
[51:10] Bridge Road you know through that area
[51:12] back to there over the lake you know she
[51:14] wanted to collect insurance so she had
[51:16] somebody to bump her old man off and she
[51:18] collected Insurance didn't do her much
[51:20] good cuz they got her in jail now going
[51:21] to you trying to for murder cuz they
[51:25] found out cuz she happened to make some
[51:27] cell phone calls from over there and
[51:29] claim she wouldn't over there see
[51:31] they're getting smart now so you know
[51:33] but now listen by no circumstances at
[51:36] all she must remain single as long as
[51:39] her first husband is living right and if
[51:41] she should do such a sin she shall be
[51:44] called an
[51:45] adulterous now watch I'm speaking of the
[51:47] natural atype it with the
[51:50] spiritual if this woman would commit
[51:52] such a sin then she is marked an
[51:55] adulterous
[51:57] if she has two living husbands at the
[51:59] same time therefore she has forfeited by
[52:02] doing their her rights to God in heaven
[52:06] read what he saying by doing so she sure
[52:09] has she is an outcast from the economy
[52:11] of God according to the scripture that
[52:13] I've just
[52:14] read so is the church when she tries to
[52:17] mix Creed and denomination with the word
[52:20] of God she can't be married to a
[52:23] denomination and be the bride of Christ
[52:26] at the the same time she's got to be
[52:28] dead to one or the other the law says so
[52:30] here there's plenty of laws in God's
[52:32] word and that's his law Paul speaking
[52:34] the same thing she cannot be married to
[52:36] a church a worldly Creed and be the
[52:39] bride of Christ because she one is
[52:42] contrary to the other now remember right
[52:45] so
[52:46] now tying it together with the natural
[52:50] the spiritual the new
[52:52] birth and following that line all right
[52:56] watch the next one go ahead cuz we got a
[52:58] lot of reading to
[53:02] do all right progress 71 72 I have to
[53:06] keep up with these I
[53:09] get on the wrong parts of
[53:12] it paragraph 71 now she is a woman if
[53:15] she married to if she is married to
[53:18] Christ the word she cannot be married to
[53:20] a church denomination at the same
[53:22] time she's Bound for she's Bound by it
[53:27] she shall cannot live with both husbands
[53:29] at the same time they're contrary one to
[53:31] the other one is God sent the other is
[53:33] man-made so they're contrary said let
[53:37] every man's word be a lie mine be the
[53:39] truth God said that just as much
[53:42] contrary to one another as law was to
[53:46] Grace as Paul Paul's speaking of here
[53:49] one must be dead to have the other and
[53:52] if she tries to mix them she shall be
[53:54] called an adultery oh think of it New
[53:56] York Arizona Across the Nation think of
[53:58] it God said if she tried to be married
[54:01] to two at the same time she shall be
[54:03] called an adulterous what adulterous can
[54:06] enter Heaven would God marry an
[54:08] adulterous certainly not he asked us not
[54:11] to do it she shall be called an
[54:14] adulterous all right now we've got to
[54:17] get down to
[54:20] understand and follow the
[54:23] lineup right now so we see that she he
[54:26] must be dead I mean the husband he's got
[54:28] to be dead there's no
[54:31] grounds now the three things we're
[54:33] talking
[54:35] of in the New
[54:37] Birth we will be reading in a minute
[54:40] about the
[54:41] world and the things and how that we
[54:44] came married to the world our old
[54:47] husband the
[54:49] world all right see and to be born
[54:53] again you must die to yourself
[54:59] right he'll be born again all right then
[55:03] in the point that we're talking about
[55:05] the the grace of marriage and
[55:12] divorce and we see the natural marriage
[55:15] and divorce or what it is right that her
[55:17] husband must be dead right all right now
[55:21] remember folks when we're
[55:23] talking the women think we're only
[55:25] picking on them remember the bride of
[55:28] Christ is is man and
[55:32] woman
[55:34] okay so the man might Str around about I
[55:37] got my grace straightened
[55:40] [Music]
[55:43] out well what about your old husband the
[55:46] denomination still alive that's I left
[55:49] that a long time ago brother M had a
[55:51] good statement he said you get your coat
[55:52] and hat and you
[55:54] leave that's was a good way of saying
[55:57] you get your coat and hat and you leave
[55:58] and you go to another place you hang
[56:01] your coat and hat up
[56:03] right see not a not an old just to hang
[56:07] him up in the
[56:09] closet none of that can be done right
[56:14] got to be
[56:15] dated so is it now with the invisible
[56:20] Union before there can be an invisible
[56:22] Union there's got to be a death to her
[56:24] old husband right amen
[56:27] now try to keep them all together okay
[56:31] let's see where are we
[56:35] number let's go on to number
[56:37] four
[56:40] right so now watching now as I said keep
[56:44] all three things in mind cuz you're
[56:46] going to get mixed up in when he starts
[56:48] talking to see what he's talking about
[56:50] but he's going to be talking about the
[56:51] New Birth he's going to be talking about
[56:53] adoptions or whatever you want to call
[56:55] it but not using the word words you know
[56:56] the grow developed in the stature of
[56:58] perfect man and he's going to be talking
[56:59] about our natural life
[57:02] right that's why it's so hard to break
[57:05] this down to get you to see the thing
[57:07] that comes over here at the end of
[57:09] it all
[57:11] right look what he said paragraph 134
[57:14] and
[57:15] 136 135
[57:18] 136 that's all together out of the
[57:20] reaches for for her she don't want that
[57:23] oh no sir no indeed what does she do
[57:27] then so she brings forth a power a
[57:30] painted face shorts wearing Jezebel
[57:33] Society illegitimate cats they call them
[57:35] I think it's see I think they call it
[57:38] cats look at that cat going there they
[57:40] say or something like that you know she
[57:42] was born or
[57:45] married connected with her first husband
[57:48] Adam you know first husband the first
[57:50] Adam now he talking naturally now right
[57:54] but remember naturally is naturally as
[57:56] far as going into the natural parts and
[57:58] it's natural into what we're doing in
[57:59] the new birth right because it's showing
[58:02] where we come from she was born or
[58:04] married connected with her first husband
[58:06] the first Adam by the adulterous wife of
[58:09] Eve Adam's first wife I like putting
[58:12] that in there but I didn't you know some
[58:14] people read that and say brother you add
[58:16] you better go look at the book he want
[58:17] said Adam's first wife you say
[58:20] adulterous she sure was but oh she
[58:23] claims that this Adam this first Adam is
[58:27] [Music]
[58:29] dead oh sure he died a long time ago I'm
[58:33] reborn
[58:36] again she said and I'm certainly married
[58:39] to the second Adam Christ the
[58:44] word now is there a denomination
[58:47] anywhere in the message outside the
[58:49] message anywhere okay that says they're
[58:52] not married to the second Adam which the
[58:54] second Adam is Christ right
[58:57] first Adam was made a living Soul the
[58:59] second Adam was a quickening spirit
[59:02] right is there any church that would say
[59:05] that they're not married to the
[59:08] word what's
[59:10] wrong some wrong
[59:12] somewhere cuz God's word surely is not
[59:14] mixed that up you know that much mixed
[59:16] up I'm sorry it's just not watch now he
[59:21] talking about he talking about I'm
[59:23] reborn again she says
[59:28] that doesn't the basis of the religious
[59:30] World claim to be born again that's
[59:33] right I mean isn't that the key point of
[59:36] all religions whether it be you walk
[59:38] down the aisle and you say a whole bunch
[59:40] of Creeds or you you do a certain things
[59:43] or or you you do certain things for
[59:45] three or four months you know all kind
[59:46] of churches has got things in it that
[59:48] they call a new birth that's
[59:52] right now how can all that be so mixed
[59:55] up
[59:58] I thought there was just one New
[1:00:00] Birth you know I didn't know that there
[1:00:02] was all kind of new births no I thought
[1:00:05] the new birth was the birth of the
[1:00:08] word now so follow me he's talking about
[1:00:12] her first
[1:00:14] Adam to be born again your first Adam
[1:00:16] has got to be dead that's right we'll
[1:00:18] get to it in a minute on a direct quote
[1:00:20] where brother says your first Adam the
[1:00:22] world that's right so to be born again
[1:00:27] your old nature that's right must die
[1:00:30] that's right right to be born again
[1:00:32] that's right you got to go through
[1:00:34] justification sanctification and the
[1:00:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost to be born
[1:00:38] again so that means your old husband is
[1:00:41] dead
[1:00:42] right now if not you're not born again
[1:00:48] right all
[1:00:50] right now but just because you're born
[1:00:53] again does that do away with all of your
[1:00:55] thinking all of your organizational isms
[1:00:58] Etc no we didn't even know we needed to
[1:01:02] get rid of all of
[1:01:03] them we all thought Glory Hallelujah
[1:01:06] they somewhere they're pretty good and
[1:01:07] they fit somewhere in the crowd you know
[1:01:10] and oh no now we know that these people
[1:01:11] got their weird ideas and they got their
[1:01:13] weird ideas and we got weird ideas but
[1:01:15] we're all going to the same
[1:01:19] place that might be true we might all
[1:01:22] wind up in the same place it may be hot
[1:01:25] there
[1:01:26] little cold for some of you years
[1:01:30] today now get you the life where to
[1:01:33] clear up things in your
[1:01:35] mind watch now where he starts off
[1:01:37] paragraph 136 so he's talking about the
[1:01:39] new bird right come down what does he
[1:01:41] say notice what she loves watch her
[1:01:44] lover now these for a little bit will be
[1:01:46] tied up into churches situations but
[1:01:49] it'll be tied up with like the old
[1:01:51] nature and situation and dying to that
[1:01:54] and getting born again the word says but
[1:01:57] she said my church says
[1:02:00] this then who then who she in love
[1:02:06] with who is her
[1:02:11] husband her own fruits prove what she is
[1:02:14] exactly right shows what she is notice
[1:02:18] she was born first to Adam because
[1:02:21] that's her natural nature so now we're
[1:02:23] still on the new birth
[1:02:27] see and she never left
[1:02:30] that now I've done said two or three
[1:02:32] keys in what I've said that when you
[1:02:36] come over and we keep going and then I
[1:02:38] hope your mind will click back and he
[1:02:39] said that and he said that to be born
[1:02:42] again your old husband must be dead
[1:02:44] that's true
[1:02:46] right you're not born again if the old
[1:02:49] nature of the world is still alive
[1:02:51] that's
[1:02:52] right now how did that old nature die
[1:02:58] well I just quit I I just quit doing
[1:03:00] them
[1:03:01] things well why you still doing
[1:03:04] it right it's all his
[1:03:08] problem and see there's a key all the
[1:03:10] way through here yes because see to be
[1:03:13] born again God had to let that's right
[1:03:19] your old husband
[1:03:21] Adam die that's right that's right or
[1:03:26] your soul is not born again that's right
[1:03:29] now if I was you I'd write that down and
[1:03:32] notice how many times I'll make that
[1:03:36] statement that God let that die that's
[1:03:40] right
[1:03:41] amen I just keep that in my mind yes
[1:03:45] we'll come back to it
[1:03:47] amen see
[1:03:49] PR her fruit shows what she is exactly
[1:03:53] right shows what she is notice she was
[1:03:55] born first to Adam cuz that's her
[1:03:57] natural birth see and she never left
[1:04:00] that
[1:04:03] right that's a lover of the world right
[1:04:06] she claims she is born with this born
[1:04:09] the second time to
[1:04:11] Christ but her lover notices Adam right
[1:04:16] yet because she loves the world Amen now
[1:04:20] you know what the Bible said you love
[1:04:21] the world the things of the world the
[1:04:22] love of the fathers not any in other
[1:04:24] words Translating that if you love The
[1:04:25] the world and things of the world you're
[1:04:27] don't you're not born again that's right
[1:04:29] now that doesn't mean we can't go out
[1:04:31] here and do this that doesn't mean that
[1:04:32] see you get under that and people their
[1:04:34] minds they locked off right then about
[1:04:37] probably half of you did right about
[1:04:38] that time and what do you mean you know
[1:04:41] okay open up we'll talk about it a
[1:04:43] second get it cleared up it doesn't mean
[1:04:46] that we are not living in this world it
[1:04:47] doesn't mean that we don't work for a
[1:04:49] living it doesn't mean that we don't do
[1:04:51] the thing of life that is not worldism
[1:04:54] that's right that is what we've got to
[1:04:56] do to make a
[1:04:58] living and we got to have a home we got
[1:05:00] to have a car we got to have a job
[1:05:03] that's right okay right I know see I
[1:05:07] probably when I get into that maybe I
[1:05:09] shouldn't explain that brother told me
[1:05:10] years ago he said you explain things too
[1:05:13] much well I don't leave no
[1:05:15] loopholes so now all computers clicked
[1:05:18] off and come back on to where I'm at
[1:05:20] brains you know we're not talking about
[1:05:23] the world it's okay for us to go out
[1:05:25] here and go to a cafe and eat supper
[1:05:27] that's right but I do stay away from the
[1:05:29] ones if I can that's got all the beer
[1:05:31] sitting out and all of the things I said
[1:05:33] if I can because you can't all way if
[1:05:35] you're going to eat you're going to find
[1:05:37] garbage that's true all right but don't
[1:05:40] call that whism that's right because
[1:05:43] that you like a three-piece suit and I
[1:05:45] like a two-piece suit he's a centner he
[1:05:48] likes three piece I
[1:05:50] to none of that all right get it down
[1:05:56] see because she loves the world
[1:06:00] right now today is Sunday to express
[1:06:05] something how many people this afternoon
[1:06:08] in follows this message you know that
[1:06:11] it's getting to be a popular thing that
[1:06:13] they only having one Sunday service
[1:06:16] right in the people of this
[1:06:18] message well if I didn't have no more to
[1:06:20] preach what they do I probably wouldn't
[1:06:22] want but one one every 3 week honest
[1:06:25] right sarcasm
[1:06:27] okay but you know yourself you check
[1:06:31] around you'll find out a lot of the the
[1:06:33] churches are now having one possibly two
[1:06:35] Services a week some will have a
[1:06:38] Wednesday night Thursday night or
[1:06:40] whatever night you know they'll have one
[1:06:41] and then they'll have a Saturday night
[1:06:43] or they'll have a Wednesday night and a
[1:06:45] Sunday morning service and that's their
[1:06:47] business that ain't nothing to n me and
[1:06:50] you but it's just a point that's right
[1:06:53] when we are supposed to be getting the
[1:06:55] word filled into us daily and Desiring
[1:06:58] to eat daily and then we don't want to

[1:07:29] the Prophet but I've never broke
[1:07:32] them I made a promise of the Lord
[1:07:35] myself he said if you're out in the
[1:07:37] woods and not able to go to
[1:07:39] church he said go ahead and
[1:07:43] Hunt I don't do it I've took my gun and

[1:08:17] way and I had been tagged out on our
[1:08:19] deer about years ago and uh I would take
[1:08:23] those two and go with them andour a
[1:08:25] pistol to her be my protection and go
[1:08:28] put them on the deer stand and go set up
[1:08:29] against a tree somewhere and read my
[1:08:33] Bible why because I believe in doing

[1:09:24] life to get back seriousness part but to
[1:09:27] understand what I'm
[1:09:30] saying it's not worly to be of life that
[1:09:33] we live that's right but it's worldly
[1:09:36] when we
[1:09:37] put in front of people that it's okay to
[1:09:42] go do things that's right that are not
[1:09:45] according to what ought to be done right
[1:09:47] right and I I've made the statements of

[1:09:58] Bill Cunningham and I used to fish years
[1:10:00] ago and we'd be out on Saturday night
[1:10:02] well 12:00 came we took our rods and
[1:10:05] reels and laid them in the boat told
[1:10:07] what bait we had to over if we going to
[1:10:09] get rid of it whatever we would be there
[1:10:11] 2:00 or 3: in the morning just sitting
[1:10:12] there
[1:10:14] talking never fishing another
[1:10:18] fish why because the prophets said don't
[1:10:22] do it so we just didn't do it
[1:10:26] now you say well you calling me world
[1:10:28] because I do that no the the word does
[1:10:31] Prophet does now what we argue about it
[1:10:33] is no
[1:10:35] problem I'm just saying you got to work
[1:10:37] for a living and you your job requires
[1:10:39] you to work Sunday you work on Sunday
[1:10:42] but if you can get you a job to keep you
[1:10:43] from working on Sunday don't work on
[1:10:45] Sunday that's that's you know that's as
[1:10:48] much as I can say to you cuz there's
[1:10:50] some jobs required that you work on
[1:10:51] Sunday right and you can't have it so
[1:10:54] we're we're not something to say bless
[1:10:56] God quit your job cuz you're working on
[1:10:57] Sunday no you don't have to make a
[1:10:59] living it's hard to find a job
[1:11:04] now but it's like brother Tom used to
[1:11:06] say I think I won't call the name where
[1:11:09] he was at church but brother used to say
[1:11:11] and this brother toen said if you're
[1:11:12] working on Sunday to bring more money
[1:11:14] into this church you come to church on
[1:11:17] Sunday sit on the Pew and I'll give you
[1:11:19] money right and it was a good point
[1:11:22] right brother Tom went in told him he
[1:11:24] wasn't working the morning on Sunday
[1:11:26] right and he was cutting down 11 11 and
[1:11:28] 1/2 hours a day which amounted to
[1:11:31] somewhere in the neighborhood of
[1:11:32] probably
[1:11:33] $300 or four that he would make in that
[1:11:36] one
[1:11:37] day you just understand see sometimes we
[1:11:40] got to make things and find out what
[1:11:41] life is okay now we're trying to get out
[1:11:43] of all of that now watch and another
[1:11:46] thing watch notice what kind of children
[1:11:49] she's
[1:11:53] buing now watch this situation and let's
[1:11:57] call it
[1:12:01] whism I see a lot of the people in this
[1:12:03] message that they us go to church when
[1:12:06] they want
[1:12:07] to well how can you blame your kids
[1:12:09] coming up under
[1:12:13] you I mean can you can you say anything
[1:12:17] about their life if if you doing it in
[1:12:19] front of
[1:12:21] them I no that hurts feelings but that's
[1:12:23] that's all right I love you so I hope
[1:12:27] you love
[1:12:29] me but now see that's that's what kind
[1:12:32] of children are is she
[1:12:34] bearing you you watch this church right
[1:12:36] over here and you'll see that they bu
[1:12:38] the same kind of
[1:12:41] children the way they dress and what
[1:12:43] they wear is handed down to their
[1:12:46] children
[1:12:47] right see then that can be worldism see
[1:12:50] the old husband can still well be alive
[1:12:52] it could be a sign that you're not even
[1:12:54] born again that's
[1:12:56] right see what kind of a children is she
[1:12:59] bearing that tells what their papa is
[1:13:02] whether it's the first Adam or second
[1:13:06] Adam if the church brings forth a child
[1:13:09] of the second Adam now the second Adam
[1:13:12] if a church bring forth a child of the
[1:13:14] second Adam which is Christ all right he
[1:13:16] acts the second Adam's way of acting
[1:13:19] like they did on the day of Pentecost
[1:13:21] right if you're true born again
[1:13:23] Christian you're going to follow the
[1:13:24] word right
[1:13:26] right yes sir that's the really true
[1:13:28] second Adam's children see
[1:13:31] right their nature is like his and hers
[1:13:35] yes sir her daughters no what he dring
[1:13:38] back to the other point what yes sir her
[1:13:40] daughter's painted face bed ha wearing
[1:13:43] men's clothes and trousers the Bible
[1:13:46] said for her not to do it she cuts her
[1:13:49] heart it's a shame to her we done been
[1:13:51] through the thing and he says then shut
[1:13:54] up
[1:13:56] cuz he was out there in Louisiana
[1:13:58] streetport Louisiana and he said you say
[1:14:02] shut up he said but in other words
[1:14:04] that's what the word says that's right
[1:14:06] they couldn't argue with him on that but
[1:14:07] they wanted him to hush all right okay
[1:14:10] let's go to the next
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:15] one see you'll notice there's only
[1:14:17] sometimes just a paragraph or two in
[1:14:19] between the one to the next one this
[1:14:22] paragraph 151 through 150
[1:14:26] three I guess or
[1:14:28] something now notice the Bible clly says
[1:14:31] here that her first husband must be
[1:14:33] dead not just put away he's like to be
[1:14:36] dead now trying to get back to all of
[1:14:39] the three things the situation of all of
[1:14:43] the three things that we were talking
[1:14:44] about the New Birth the marriage and
[1:14:47] divorce the invisible
[1:14:50] Union the qualifications is the same for
[1:14:53] all three right
[1:14:55] the old husband must be dead watch now
[1:15:00] now if I was you I'd look at that
[1:15:02] statement right there and I'd say well
[1:15:05] that man is meaning something because he
[1:15:07] darkened out that I had that underlined
[1:15:10] in then circular and brother uh Anderson
[1:15:13] him picked it up and I like that watch
[1:15:16] what he's talking about now do you think
[1:15:18] he's not talking about marriage and
[1:15:19] divorce or anything else he just don't
[1:15:21] what notice the Bible plainly says here
[1:15:23] that the first husband must be dead not
[1:15:25] just put away he's got to be dead I just
[1:15:27] got to preaching on marriage and divorce
[1:15:29] and you know you all know about that I'm
[1:15:32] not speaking now all together this
[1:15:34] congregation here but Across the Nation
[1:15:36] all right now you see what happened
[1:15:40] there I'd write that
[1:15:44] down and if I fail to bring it out
[1:15:46] somebody asked me a question what did
[1:15:48] you
[1:15:50] mean you see what happened
[1:15:53] there told it to be a
[1:15:56] key now you see what happened there in
[1:15:59] marriage and
[1:16:03] divorce something happened
[1:16:09] there and how did it happen when it the
[1:16:12] Seven Seals were open that brought out
[1:16:15] the real truth of
[1:16:17] it you remember this morning if the
[1:16:20] seals hadn't broke to the prophet he
[1:16:21] couldn't have preached marriage and
[1:16:22] divorce right all right so write that
[1:16:25] down and hold
[1:16:28] it so be married to the second Adam
[1:16:30] Christ the
[1:16:32] word you must separate yourself by Death
[1:16:34] from your first denominational husband
[1:16:38] now he's moved up into a stage
[1:16:41] right I a talking about your
[1:16:43] denominational
[1:16:45] husband he ain't just solely talking
[1:16:47] about the New
[1:16:50] Birth he's got on to the stage of your
[1:16:53] denominational husband
[1:16:55] MH cuz there isn't a one of them that
[1:16:58] can take all the word of God just show
[1:17:01] me where that one is at oh you say mine
[1:17:04] you say Lula
[1:17:06] okay the other fell says his too put
[1:17:10] them together and you find out you're
[1:17:13] both
[1:17:16] wrong soon as
[1:17:18] you
[1:17:21] denominate read Revelation 17 so you see
[1:17:25] you got to be dead from that
[1:17:28] thing now I'm not speaking to this local
[1:17:32] assembly I'm speaking all together
[1:17:34] Across the Nation you must be dead to
[1:17:38] your first husband right if you're
[1:17:41] United to Christ and still married to a
[1:17:45] denomination you're an adulterous you
[1:17:48] are Lady of
[1:17:52] sea now he's not talking about just a
[1:17:55] new birth right that's right I'm hoping
[1:17:58] you're going to follow this through the
[1:17:59] message then you can take the book and
[1:18:01] just sit down and read it and you might
[1:18:02] do it with all books if you try to do it
[1:18:04] sometime that's true is to see what the
[1:18:07] man's talking
[1:18:09] about so watch it a church across the
[1:18:14] nation we're following Jesus Christ the
[1:18:18] word to be in the
[1:18:21] bride now he's still up there in that
[1:18:24] organiz religion Point watch
[1:18:27] it to be in the bride you have to be
[1:18:29] remarried to the word of God which is
[1:18:33] Christ that's right Amen in the
[1:18:35] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:18:36] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:18:38] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen
[1:18:40] as long as you hold to man's tradition
[1:18:43] of denominations right you are called in
[1:18:47] God's word and adulterous as long as
[1:18:50] you're a denominational Creed
[1:18:53] Seeker belong to a denominational church
[1:18:57] that denies the word you're an
[1:18:59] adulterous what the Bible says amen now
[1:19:02] he's up in the higher than just your new
[1:19:04] birth right that's
[1:19:06] right come
[1:19:09] on Jesus said you cannot serve two Gods
[1:19:12] at the same time you either serve God or
[1:19:14] Mamon mamam is the
[1:19:17] world right heard that preached a
[1:19:20] million times in the Baptist
[1:19:22] Church but they call Mamon money
[1:19:26] he that loves the world are the things
[1:19:28] of the world the love of God is not even
[1:19:30] in right the seed of God cannot be in
[1:19:33] him the same
[1:19:34] time the love of God in other words seed
[1:19:37] of God the love of God the love of the
[1:19:39] world is in there you can't be there at
[1:19:41] the same time same time the love of the
[1:19:43] world same time the seat of God can't be
[1:19:45] at the same time with the world in there
[1:19:47] that's right when the seat of God is
[1:19:48] operating through you that's the word of
[1:19:50] God the love of the world can't be in
[1:19:53] there at the same time now where is the
[1:19:55] short High and the shorts and the
[1:19:57] painted faces now where is it at you see
[1:20:02] see what he's getting yes see where it's
[1:20:04] coming to yes and I see I know for
[1:20:06] certain I ain't going to
[1:20:08] get nowhere wrong what I want it
[1:20:11] to but we'll try to get another one or
[1:20:14] two let's see if we
[1:20:19] can all right let's fall back we jumped
[1:20:23] up talking about in these quotes talking
[1:20:25] about denominationalism let's get back
[1:20:27] we just moved over to paragraph
[1:20:29] 212 let's get this and then we'll try to
[1:20:31] we'll quit on this CU we'll just cover
[1:20:33] the new birth all now I'm going to be
[1:20:36] covering now is everybody listening I'm
[1:20:38] only going to be covering in this quote
[1:20:41] about the New Birth
[1:20:43] okay I am not going to be talking about
[1:20:46] the grace of marriage and divorce I am
[1:20:49] not going to be talking about invisible
[1:20:51] Union I'm going to be talking about the
[1:20:54] new birth
[1:20:55] amen cuz that's what he's doing that's
[1:20:58] why brother Brown could talk about the
[1:20:59] new birth and be talking about organized
[1:21:02] religion he could be talking about this
[1:21:04] and be over here and is totally gone
[1:21:07] from people that don't have a revelation
[1:21:09] that's right because they wonder what in
[1:21:10] the world he's talking about cuz he just
[1:21:11] went to organize religion now he's going
[1:21:13] to flop back to the New Birth okay
[1:21:16] what paragraph 221 now was nature
[1:21:19] associated with
[1:21:22] death your first husband that who had
[1:21:25] rule over you was your Nature by natural
[1:21:27] birth now there is coming up the husband
[1:21:31] being the
[1:21:33] world the natural thing right the first
[1:21:37] Adam brother Mo used to preach his he
[1:21:40] preach a message he called him are you
[1:21:41] married to Adam or Christ
[1:21:43] right
[1:21:46] now had rule over you your Nature by
[1:21:49] natural birth natural you love the world
[1:21:52] because you are the world and part of
[1:21:53] the world that's right congregation says
[1:21:56] amen your desires was by nature to love
[1:21:59] the world which you're a part of you're
[1:22:01] a part of nature you believe that amen
[1:22:04] and that's your natural thing that's the
[1:22:07] reason you have to be born again you
[1:22:09] have to separate you have to die to that
[1:22:12] first husband amen you can't live with
[1:22:15] it that's right you just can't say well
[1:22:17] I'll divorce him and hang him up here
[1:22:21] till occasion no sir no writing a
[1:22:23] divorcement he dies the nature of the
[1:22:26] world has to die every spec of him has
[1:22:29] to die you have to be
[1:22:33] reunited again with another nature
[1:22:36] that's right all right so the nature of
[1:22:39] the world has to
[1:22:41] die right now how did the nature of the
[1:22:47] world you're trying to get born
[1:22:50] again how did the nature of the world
[1:22:53] die
[1:22:55] y right justification
[1:23:01] sanctification
[1:23:03] right right amen cleanses the soul to
[1:23:07] make it free you die to your own self
[1:23:10] that's right right so now we making a
[1:23:12] statement it's going to be later in here
[1:23:14] that we'll see it won't be today God let
[1:23:17] it die right that's right the only way
[1:23:20] you could ever be born again you explain
[1:23:21] to me how you got born again right you
[1:23:23] explain to me one day you was a sinner
[1:23:25] out in the world and and died in
[1:23:28] sin and the next day you would head to
[1:23:31] church amen you explain
[1:23:35] that something had to
[1:23:39] die that old adamic nature that's that's
[1:23:43] right had to
[1:23:46] die now I want to see how far I can go
[1:23:50] 152
[1:23:58] okay we'll just finish
[1:24:02] up we'll finish one or two more then
[1:24:05] we'll
[1:24:06] quit now
[1:24:09] watching your name and your first nature
[1:24:12] was born and put in a Book of
[1:24:17] Life all your Deeds remember
[1:24:22] that for later on all your Deeds was
[1:24:26] wrote in it
[1:24:28] right cuz the book of life is not the
[1:24:32] loue book of life
[1:24:35] right okay not two books two sections of
[1:24:39] one book that's right all right so it
[1:24:43] was wrote in
[1:24:45] there so then in the second stage of it
[1:24:48] coming up to the spiritual our old
[1:24:52] denominational husband is still wrote in
[1:24:58] there as long as we got that idea he
[1:25:01] still wrote there that's right
[1:25:05] right you still alive that's
[1:25:08] right and then you can claim all you
[1:25:10] want to third stage that I believe the
[1:25:13] prophet's message
[1:25:16] right I was married before or whatever
[1:25:19] it is and I accepted it and now I'm free
[1:25:27] but you ever look around try to find out
[1:25:30] where that old man's
[1:25:35] at now I don't mean anything wrong with
[1:25:38] this I mean the
[1:25:39] truth I've tried to explain
[1:25:43] it I was in the world yes I'm
[1:25:48] sorry but I never did ask early Marin
[1:25:50] that was one thing for sure wouldn't do
[1:25:52] and I would in no way in the world have
[1:25:53] anything to do with married women I
[1:25:56] would not that was just part of
[1:25:59] me and I told you I confessed to my wife
[1:26:02] before we
[1:26:03] married she asked me one day something
[1:26:05] about I said look
[1:26:07] honey I wish every girl and have food
[1:26:10] was sit get to church
[1:26:15] today and let me preach to
[1:26:18] him the love of Jesus
[1:26:21] Christ to get him saved
[1:26:25] amen she said could you do
[1:26:28] that
[1:26:31] yeah I do
[1:26:33] it I said I want to ask you a
[1:26:37] question I said suppose they get born
[1:26:40] again and they're coming to
[1:26:44] church could you put your arms around
[1:26:46] him and call him
[1:26:51] sister she said yes
[1:26:56] see that means a lot about your old
[1:27:03] husband
[1:27:05] right I know people would differ with me
[1:27:08] and say well no I'd have these bad
[1:27:10] ideas I thought we're supposed to pray
[1:27:13] right amen about these bad
[1:27:16] ideas I'm a human moral I have bad
[1:27:22] ideas cuz there's no problem old say and
[1:27:24] goes with the bird that flies over your
[1:27:26] head it's when you allow it to nest in
[1:27:29] your
[1:27:30] heart you can't help but think wrong
[1:27:34] right but you can keep from thinking on
[1:27:37] the thinking of thinking wrong that's
[1:27:39] right or
[1:27:41] not you mean you couldn't stand before a
[1:27:45] a person that You' been immoral with
[1:27:47] them and you're a Christian and you
[1:27:49] wouldn't want them people saved
[1:27:58] I'm sorry that you know if that don't
[1:28:01] that offend you I'm sorry cuz it's just
[1:28:04] that's just me that's the way I am cuz
[1:28:07] see I want that old denominational
[1:28:08] husband to be so
[1:28:11] dead that I don't have him alive no
[1:28:15] more I want him
[1:28:18] dead God's the only one that can let him
[1:28:20] die that's right all right so then all
[1:28:23] of our things watch let's see where your
[1:28:25] name of your nature was born and put in
[1:28:27] the Book of Life all your Deeds was
[1:28:29] wrote in it too everything you done
[1:28:32] under that nature was put in a book
[1:28:34] called The Book of Life now remember the
[1:28:36] Book of Life is the natural life that we
[1:28:39] live upon the Earth and and everybody's
[1:28:42] written in there of the natural life
[1:28:45] that they live now as one quote the
[1:28:48] prophet gives you the word that is not
[1:28:49] even written nowh which means it didn't
[1:28:50] even account to be being want to be
[1:28:52] written but that's all right now but
[1:28:55] it's put in the book of life that's
[1:28:56] different from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:58] it's a different section of the same
[1:29:00] book so we got to see it
[1:29:03] transferred well I come here with mine
[1:29:05] in that book of life well I come in here
[1:29:08] a dirty messed up garbage can what about
[1:29:12] you me too I want to see it transferred
[1:29:16] myself now you notice in Daniel when he
[1:29:19] comes to the Ancient of Days whose her
[1:29:20] was his white as wolf 10,000 time 10,000
[1:29:23] came with him to to him the the the
[1:29:25] bride and then the books and then the
[1:29:28] books were open see books books not one
[1:29:32] books one is Book of Life books and
[1:29:36] another book was open which was The Book
[1:29:38] of
[1:29:40] Life see there is Saints already there
[1:29:44] in the church the bride already the
[1:29:47] bride another book was open which was
[1:29:49] the book of life now but now you but
[1:29:53] when you you were separated from that
[1:29:55] Union by spiritual
[1:29:57] death listen your natural Desir is to
[1:30:00] cut your heart your natural desires to

[1:30:04] desire to be intellectual smart men know
[1:30:07] something better than the other that's

[1:30:11] you wanted well you say you little 2x4
[1:30:14] preacher there and tell me I got a PhD
[1:30:18] that just means you're further away from
[1:30:20] God every time you add one thing see see
[1:30:22] that's the right is true true all right
[1:30:25] let's just get to the next one I think
[1:30:26] we'll quit on that part all right pull
[1:30:29] me back down just a there you go that's
[1:30:31] what eve took she was pregnated with
[1:30:35] that kind of a pregnation
[1:30:38] right now Eve was
[1:30:41] pregnated with that kind of pregnation
[1:30:43] that's why you need a new birth right
[1:30:46] now watch that and that's the church
[1:30:49] today the church today is the same as
[1:30:51] eeve Bible school didn't ual and look
[1:30:54] everyone disagreeing with the other one
[1:30:56] a big mess just exactly what the Bible
[1:30:58] said Babylon now she was pregnated with
[1:31:01] that kind of
[1:31:03] pregnation now in the natural Eve was
[1:31:05] pregnated with the seed from the
[1:31:09] Beast right right okay but brother Brown
[1:31:14] said before that that natural act took
[1:31:17] place that Satan entered her thinking
[1:31:21] ability
[1:31:24] and when he entered that thinking
[1:31:26] ability and she started making choices
[1:31:28] and things she come out to be a
[1:31:31] denominational
[1:31:33] prostitute he said it wouldn't even done
[1:31:35] back up right I agree with you it would
[1:31:36] even back there around and said
[1:31:39] all denominations come out of
[1:31:44] Genesis now that's his
[1:31:46] wor all right so then hold on to what
[1:31:50] I'm thinking about and what I'm trying
[1:31:51] to get you to see and we'll try to
[1:31:53] continue Wednesday
[1:31:56] that the three things the new birth you
[1:32:00] got to see that you're dead right right
[1:32:03] and find out how you die that's
[1:32:06] right right and I gave you the key about
[1:32:09] three times all
[1:32:12] right how do you die see come up to the
[1:32:16] next of the natural state of marriage
[1:32:18] and
[1:32:19] divorce that old husband
[1:32:24] has got to be dead that's right now
[1:32:27] whether it be husband or wife in that
[1:32:28] natural right right death the only
[1:32:35] separation come
[1:32:37] on then the
[1:32:39] third is the greater portion of marriage
[1:32:42] and
[1:32:43] divorce the old denominational husband
[1:32:46] has got to be dead cuz if he ain't
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:51] dead he's still there to be played
[1:32:53] around with
[1:32:56] those ideas in our minds has got to be
[1:32:58] dead now read invisible
[1:33:03] Union read it real
[1:33:06] careful and think of those three things
[1:33:09] in one
[1:33:10] message that your Prophet is covering
[1:33:13] three things
[1:33:18] yes and then you'll see what takes
[1:33:21] place you'll see what he said look what
[1:33:25] happened

[1:33:56] anything and come and let's believe it
[1:33:59] and accept it before we have the

[1:34:03] correct order so let's just sing that if

[1:35:12] my
[1:35:17] Sal on
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:25] amen let's just read your
[1:35:29] scripture Paul in 1 Corinthians 11th
[1:35:32] chapter verse 23 for I have received of
[1:35:34] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:35:36] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:35:38] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:35:39] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:35:42] broke it and said take eat this is my
[1:35:44] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:35:46] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:35:49] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:35:51] saying this cup is the new Testament in
[1:35:54] my blood this do ye as often as you
[1:35:56] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[1:35:59] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:36:01] this cup you do sh the Lord's death till
[1:36:03] he come wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:36:07] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:36:08] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:36:11] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:36:13] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:36:16] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:36:18] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:36:19] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:36:21] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:36:24] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:36:25] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:36:29] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:36:32] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:36:34] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:36:37] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:36:38] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:36:41] another If any man hunger let him eat at
[1:36:43] home that you come not together into
[1:36:46] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:36:48] order when I come the prophet said what
[1:36:51] they were doing they were just
[1:36:54] eating and just turning around and just
[1:36:57] taking the communion they called
[1:36:59] it that's why he said you know if you're
[1:37:02] hungry eat at
[1:37:05] home that's what they were doing there
[1:37:07] see it wasn't something they were just
[1:37:09] having a meal in other words and then
[1:37:10] they just they just flop over and take
[1:37:12] the communion and just it wasn't sacred
[1:37:15] or nothing he said don't do that eat it
[1:37:17] home come together take communion we
[1:37:20] said to T one for another so let's just
[1:37:22] pray one for another the Lord would
[1:37:24] bless and guide each and every one of
[1:37:38] us bless each and every one go we love
[1:37:42] you and we thank you in Jesus name
[1:37:47] amen the Bible said he took bread and
[1:37:50] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:37:52] bread that's been made for this purpose
[1:37:54] this afternoon and we come to this place
[1:37:57] now to to partake we know that this is
[1:38:00] not your body it's not a round wafer
[1:38:04] it's a bread that we break and we
[1:38:06] believe it is made special by special
[1:38:08] hands Lord and made of a special
[1:38:11] ingredients to where it doesn't have
[1:38:12] anything in it we thank you because it's
[1:38:15] speaking of your word that Lord was
[1:38:19] there your body because you were the
[1:38:21] word made flesh now we ask ask you to
[1:38:23] sanctify this bread into
[1:38:26] partakers Lord just help us to think
[1:38:29] about your word as we partake of this
[1:38:31] bread and think about you what you've
[1:38:33] done for us sanctify the bread and the
[1:38:35] partakers in Jesus name
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:49] amen see we think a lot of times we say
[1:38:52] well and I am glad of it but we say we
[1:38:56] we've learned the
[1:38:57] truth we're not like the rest of them
[1:38:59] people that got that old wafer and you
[1:39:02] can order right out of books and places
[1:39:05] now a little thing that it's got a
[1:39:09] little round wafer looking thing on the
[1:39:10] top of it little covering on it and it's
[1:39:13] got wine in it and they're throw away
[1:39:15] cups you know it's not wine it's grape
[1:39:19] juice and you know probably some people
[1:39:22] would send you actually wine in it I'm
[1:39:25] sure you could order it if you
[1:39:27] wanted but see that's not
[1:39:30] exactly you know the way that it should
[1:39:33] be but we The Bread is made and made the
[1:39:37] day that you partake of it and destroyed
[1:39:41] the night before the night is over of
[1:39:43] what's left the wine the it's not just a
[1:39:48] grape juice cuz grape juice will s but
[1:39:52] you just partake of the
[1:39:54] wine it means his blood but in that
[1:39:58] season you if we think that we're doing
[1:40:01] it right thank God for doing it right
[1:40:04] but do we just glory and blood in that
[1:40:06] well we're not like the rest of them we
[1:40:09] do it this
[1:40:10] way well
[1:40:13] why or whatever you know what would be
[1:40:16] the the
[1:40:18] point I wouldn't I wouldn't take
[1:40:21] communion and I've told you that if I
[1:40:23] was a place you know that they had grape
[1:40:26] juice and soda cracker style I wouldn't
[1:40:28] do it I just wouldn't make no s no say I
[1:40:31] ain't going to do it you know no just
[1:40:32] pass it on and just leave it alone
[1:40:36] because there is a lot to do with it the
[1:40:39] blood the wine see symbol of the blood
[1:40:41] but it's not the blood that bread is not
[1:40:43] the body it's just symbol of it right
[1:40:46] see we take it for that father we thank
[1:40:48] you for this wine that's went through
[1:40:49] the process of aging and now gets better
[1:40:52] as we each day we see it Lord because it
[1:40:55] speaks of your blood that was shed for
[1:40:57] each and every one of us we love you and
[1:40:59] we thank you sanctify the wine and the
[1:41:02] partakers together in one in you in

[1:41:47] me sometimes I'm
