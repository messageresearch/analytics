amen and I want to see him don't you good to see about in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn to John 1 where we've been reading from in John 1 and then we'll go to Genesis 2 try to read from there John whan Genesis 2 we really enjoyed the fellowship meeting last night and a good time in Jordan brother borlon my family and all coming in being with us and enjoyed the message you brought last night and this morning and really enjoyed it and prayed that the Lord would bless them on the way home give them a safe trip and everything so just we don't have any announcements to have to make and we don't have anything coming up too quick I don't reckon what's the next one Christmas I guess or maybe a few in between you know Thanksgiving Oh Festival in October tentatively the 28th okay we'll go from that 28 okay all right so we got get started on that and you leave one thing you start on another one okay let's just pray father we thank you for an opportunity this afternoon be able to come together in your love in your grace and to be able to be guided by you and that's your life shine father into our hearts and our lives and just Lord take care of everything be with brother boy loving him the family is there traveling back home and give them a safe trip Lord and just let your loving grace be with us we ask you to guide us into understanding to open their eyes truly as we sing to your understanding father just have your way forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name young one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him by who God we're gonna get into a little bit of the Godhead today to try to express something and maybe we can follow her along but said all things were made by the word and the word is God right and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men now I shine a thin darkness and the darkness comprehended it not man let's go over now because we're gonna pick up some creation so we'll try to move on into our thoughts we were bringing the other day so let's go to Genesis to verse 4 said and these are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made to earth into heaven not now who made do well the heavens everything the Lord God notice now that's capital L Ord and then it's dassault small lowercase G OD its meaning whatever it is heaven or earth huh you follow me whatever it is heaven the capital L Ord he's the author of that whatever it is on earth that's why you get in a minute and you're reading Genesis it's the lowercase G OD alright that will follow that and try to get her thought in every plan of the field before it was in the earth and ever above the field before it grew more the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground which I went out of mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God Jehovah Elohim alright formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul you may be seated lord have his blessing upon the reading of the word as I said I want to I want to back up a little bit in what we've been talking and move on in - oh you know some other things you know they can pick it up that may help us and and give us understanding because we've all until we came to the light of the truth we may have read a lot of scriptures or talk about it but we had in our mind that the creator was the great eternal God and that's true but you remember your thoughts as I was bringing out the other night about it you remember your thoughts back there we thought about God we talked about God we considered God we knew the word garden an object of worship we could go back through the terms of Jehovah and tell him and all of that we could go through those things back in the Baptist Methodist you know Presbyterian whatever we come from but comparing that understanding of God to what he has revealed to us in the last days after the message you know because that's the only way you and I could get it with no denomination you can get it no nobody can get it way the word comes to the Prophet but then after all that he has said do we really understand the real truth one true and living God and how it's made there were quite a while we've been dealing with one thought and I don't understand why we can't read and stay with that we're discussing it life's not with it sisters are at the house that why we can't just read it and believe it you know I mean we're not theologians that we have to talk in terms but we do use words that the theologians use because that it is a way of expressing it and that way in this it's good to use but see what was our lifestyles drilling hard upon bringing it to a thought what is a human being a human being is a wonderful thing is he's a triune being just as God is a triune being not a Trinity God is not a Trinity the triune in other words he has many many manifestations you as a human being you're a body you're a spirit which is there within you and then that's a soul that makes you a person a being My Father Son and Holy Ghost makes God a person not three persons me because that's that's not even in the scriptures of a Trinity it was never told until coming on up to about 325 AD and they begin to speak about using the word Trinity and they started out with making Jesus a lesser God and as they did then they started with the idea and concept of Father Son and Holy Ghost has to be a Trinity but yeah it's not that a way it's trying to express the one person and that's what we'll try to do throughout the Bible to the show and I'll give it to you before we start we'll talk and see how that God created the heavens God created man God created all of these things there's only one God that created this I mean I'm quoting scripture huh and then we get down you know and we'll get into the John we're talking about the word and God and who it is is being one and then how that he created all things it follows all the way through the Bible until we come into the book of James then God will go through the Colossians in the different scriptures Hebrews but it winds up in James saying all things were created and agender efficiency's excuse me it winds up saying all things were created by Jesus Christ then you find him in the Book of Revelations as the one sitting on the throne and you know who that is he comes upon the throne and sits down in the Book of Revelations which is the Lord Jesus Christ and it says you created all things and all things were made for you and by you but do we understand that and one thing for certain when we talk about Jesus Christ we're not talking about a human flesh we're talking about Almighty God so don't get confused and think that when I talk about Jesus and if I fail to say Jesus Christ keep it in your thoughts and I just say Jesus remember we're not talking about there's no such thing as the human flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ being back before the world and creating all right so if I slip up you know I'm getting old and I do a lot of things and you know but then he says I repeat myself a lot but that's one thing for sure I was doing that when I was 40 so I don't worry about it at 77 because I want you to understand what I'm talking about all right and to follow the line in the right order and to see what we're really looking at because we're gonna talk about the Creator God and we're gonna see that it'll tie together bring out a beautiful picture the revelation of one true and living God what was their life stops our life stops was talking about man we've been on that for quite a while and talking about there's a saying that man is a body a spirit and the soul that's what it takes to make a man all right now see then when Jesus Christ came to earth you know see then he became in our image was his body spirit and soul and we've expressed to you'd went over and over and over about the things but you see when that little baby was born your prophet said Jehovah crying in a cradle he said your God with no teeth no can we comprehend that we said well yeah we can see Jesus we can see Jesus with no teeth but that wouldn't know where he said it he said little Jehovah the Bible says what that he was born Emmanuel which is by interpretation God with us but now do we believe that or do we want to try to make it a second person or why can't you say then according to according to Hebrews 5 10 5 a body was provided by way of the Virgin Mary to be our brother that was the purpose Melchizedek it stood back there with Abraham was a human body but he was not kinfolks to us he was just spoke into existence a body created God stepped into the body came to earth you know the Prophet explaining that see then the two that went to Sodom he said God just he just created her body for them and they went down to Sodom we remember you saw no more of Melchizedek because Mel chasity became Jesus Christ know that who is this Mel chatter I've asked you to read that message over and over alright see then to find out then that we could look at man and see God is that hard when the Bible says that the even the eternal Godhead can be understood by the things that we see are you with me but the Bible says yeah but we want to see God but you're looking in the wrong direction because that was the trouble back daughter you a man I didn't say you're God making yourself a god did you a man making yourself God they couldn't follow that we get the word has spoken that just that's the way he would be all the types of the shattered every time pointed to a human element coming to the earth that they would call him and you would call him the Messiah that would be our brother they said Melchizedek or any other form that you find three Hebrew children and the man in the furnace with him anything you find you can't make that anything that would have anything to do with Redemption all right it would require that God Himself would come to earth once sin entered the picture that God himself would have to come to earth now you remember the story the Prophet said he said he didn't send another person no he said didn't send a son then wouldn't that be something for you to you know it comes up and you're gonna have to die and you say hey wait a minute he's all you need is one life they say yeah okay come here son goodbye I love you now that wouldn't be too good of a human being now the Almighty God that could at the flick of a finger or whatever and annihilated the mankind if he wanted to I don't think he would try to send the son so he never sent her son he came inside so that it plainly tells you God with us and that God would be on earth did he create a body probably said it like this enter body that is for he said the father to be a son has to be a father so then he spoke a body into existence and just stepped into it his soul is the soul of Almighty God his spirit was the spirit of Almighty God but Ron said that's why Jesus wouldn't know all things because he was theophany before he became flesh then in understanding that man is created we went through Genesis 1 over and over and over to understand that mankind is built in the image of God now that man in Genesis all mankind o people mankind that's why it said ezekiel 18:4 all souls are mine alright Satan can't give you a soul he kept doing the all souls belong to God alright but then Genesis 1 we established that that was a marvelous person that would be standing there because in that one person would cover the redemptive plan of mankind alright now that would give you a right to come to a position somewhere that you'd be a child of God let's see Jesus Christ now we know that the only name God ever had is Jesus but you just don't go around saying Jesus Jesus Jesus right because you get connected as the oneness and you know so the better way of saying is Jesus Christ our Lord Jesus Christ no it's like I've always said to you I want you to get one point a prophet has no power to change any scripture I don't care how great a prophet you want to think he is he has no power to change one description it wouldn't be a prophet if he did so he's got to come according to the word but it isn't isn't it amazing that the Bible and here's one's gonna throw you so listen there is no scripture that says the baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you get quiet on that won't you the Bible says in the name of Jesus Christ why was your profit and mankind was already baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before brother Branham came on the scene right you know that of of coming down why would your profit emphasize though that the correct way to baptize would be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it says Jesus Christ in learning in the book of Acts but then a little bit later of saying the name of the Lord see what your prophet is doing he's taking all of the Scriptures pertaining to baptism and by the authority given unto him not to change scriptures no way and making a false prophet I hope you understand that strong that would be if he changes anything is false prophet he can't do it you've got to come according to the word well yet he would see that the Lord is involved in one time Paul peeks over that his baptized in the name of Lord Jesus and that's why your oneness and I went to that never thing but it won't work see then the Prophet said the correct way was the Lord Jesus Christ he said because you're giving him all of the titles involved in that because everything there is everything there is there's nothing that you can get outside of Lord Jesus Christ because redemption healings everything is connected with Lord Jesus Christ now as the brother was talking last night in this morning that enjoyed me it is time to settle down to the understanding because we cannot just keep playing along and said well this is what I believe at least we ought to be able to come to a position to say why we believe it what if somebody comes to you and said how do y'all baptize you say Lord Jesus Christ what are you going to say to them when they say that ain't me in the in the Bible there's no verbatim scripture that says Lord Jesus Christ Richie Bible it's not making it deceptive for Peter to say you know are they writing in the Acts about Jesus Christ but it does say we said everyone in the about 2000 imma Jesus Christ would you accept a person into your congregation etc - preacher I'm talkin me whatever you if they come up and they said I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you think I need to be baptized again what would be your answer because according to you and your studies and the things of the prophets message and the way he done it said he baptizing named Lord Jesus Christ let me change the scripture what are you gonna say see I was approached by that years ago and the first person when only was and I baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right but I asked a person the question I said what was your previous understanding of the Godhead when you was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ dead well I guess it was under regeneration and I told him as much as I tell you I don't care how many times you've been baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said Lord Jesus Christ I don't care how many times you've been baptized in it but if you're connecting it in any way to regeneration under the name of that way then it wouldn't be right true just talking to you hmm just talking to you just asking you some simple questions but you see God knew that it would come to the point of sending a prophet and that he would take all the scriptures and he would say like I said if somebody come in and said I've baptized named Jesus Christ don't you think that's good enough I'd ask him the question what was your thoughts before then now I'm asking you another question would you be willing to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they say no I said your baptism dry yeah I have to be straight I'll I'm pastor I have to talk straight okay what did somebody come and ask you those things what would be your answer see my answer was that I so brother I said what would you believe in when you baptized name of Jesus Christ he said where we was believing what about tears I'm under regeneration and I said well then for conscience sake if nothing else I would make sure that I got baptized again and I told him I said and for straight truth sake if I was you I would never baptize anybody just the name of Jesus Christ I would make it Lord Jesus Christ you understand what I'm saying we claim a prophet has come and brought us the truth now I thought according to brother Branham that this messenger of life days had no certain how did he say that wanted no certain mystery of what was it he said he said but he was to take all of the loose ends and bring them together all the loose ends to bring it together all right we got to loosen them he's Jesus Christ okay oh why do we baptize the Lord Jesus Christ and see they're not like I said we always do it I always say to fulfill Matthew 28:19 it says it was a name of the Father and of the son you know the holy God i baptize thee my brother sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see that fulfills it but what if he left out one of those what if you just took Jesus Christ and he took Jesus as Matthew said baptize in the name was he wrong to say that or was he telling the truth me see the only way you could be baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy go you'd be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not the way you can do it see so you said Lord Jesus you'd be leaving one off and you wouldn't be according to Matthew see then when Peter is a sinner power one it was Paul comes over any baptizing them said they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus well it's okay to be baptized the name of Lord Jesus is it okay to be about 2,000 on the Lord's head no so a prophet brings all of the scriptures together and brings you to an understanding that ties everything together then it cannot be questioned then of what you're saying see when you finalize it by saying to fulfill the Great Commission the baptize in the name of the Father and of the son of the Holy Ghost I'm baptizing my brother with it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see Satan can't question that now don't mean he's gonna believe it because he's won it started the Father Son and Holy Ghost out of it going the other way well my point is do we believe God sent a prophet that away he was to bring us the perfect interpretation of the word of God but that he could not change Scriptures so he puts together the Scriptures a paul said lord jesus oh jesus saying father son holy god a peter every which one over in the book of acts they said in the name of jesus christ see now you put together the scriptures to come out with a conclusion that that is it and it's settled see because that way the word of god is so perfect then what's this place like that you can't question it well I'm sorry to say it and I'm human I'm sorry but and I don't mean to be derogatory or hateful but that's like I've tried to tell you when brother mode asked me said what do you believe about baptism I'm not totally father son holy God what do you believe about God I said God in three persons because that's all in you and I was reluctant to use co-equal Co eternal even in those days but still I was caught like everybody else and let me say it like you you don't want to admit it but you're caught with it seeing that that's part of your trouble right now is you don't want to admit your pice to be caught with something no I didn't believe it out we just didn't understand well what's the difference you'd understand but you see when brother mode said now father's and not a named son Holy Ghost not a knight that's true he said you say God in three persons he said a person's personality personality's an individual individuals a person well I'm not saying I had so much education or it's so smart in my brain I just had a little bit of sense and that's why I told you what happened to most people they would have argued with him I'll tell you bless God this family that's not the scripture that's right I looked at him and I said I don't believe that no more because I knew I didn't have a leg to stand up he had given a simple illustration that concluded the story of all the scriptures and me a good Baptist deacon that had been trained and tutored and all of that into those things I was a human being that was looking at a man and said okay you know my hide to the wall man I don't have nowhere to go now explain it thank God I had somebody that could explain the scriptures not just somebody you got to believe it God sent a prophet if you don't believe God sent a prophet you gonna die and go to hell he never said that he started laying the scriptures down on me day in and day out he laid the scriptures went through the name I well remember them of how many times I had never noticed before then of how many times the word name was used in the Bible until that man started nailing me from every scripture from Genesis to Revelation about the name what are you getting that brother Dale I'm getting at one time when are we gonna believe what God has said to do his work not even able to understand it we had to believe it and to believe a prophet would come to explain God to you and I how wonderful he do it he'd go back before the world he said I've got this in my mind it stalled in my mind I said let's go back said we're looking over the banisters of heaven you don't remember all of those messages from that and he starts explaining the condescending of God to mankind he used the terms are words that the theologians used we yet he explained those things in simple terminology that I liked what he says on Christ a mystery of God revealed that the most illiterate person can be saved I like that you ain't gotta have this great be the education well does that know to be saved you just gotta have a brain that'll work just a little bit and a consciousness that can believe and accept it see their lifestyle swears based on it has been for quite a while now this is all the background and we'll get to the scriptures in a minute and Colossians and Hebrews and the thing but this is all the background to show you how prophet could tie all of that things together but yet sum it up in simple language there would be so marvelous until even if the Elohim couldn't argue with him well he didn't believe him now but he couldn't argue and he remember the the Godhead explained I believe the title of the message we listen to it just recently and we're brother Adam was talking to those guys and one man come out of it later on brought around telling it you know did he come out of it and said I want three hundred tapes I'm gonna take it to all of them and the preachers and things and give them out about you know about the water baptism he said never come back and go to one what about standing there why would it be such a problem you see that's where we don't we're not prophets it didn't change none of those people now according to him they didn't come back they never came back and got baptized name the Lord Jesus Christ when he put the scriptures he'd say the name of the Father he said we go back in the book and said we read it and said John and Mary he said we go back and we look and it says Father Son and Holy Ghost it's just one true and living God and he said that's just like you are a simplicity your father you're a son and you're a human you remember that one when rosemont nailed me with that and that said settle that part right there that that was too simple for me not to understand is that crazy enough to say it better work he's had it simple that I could follow it your prophet could explain the things that the theologians could never attempt in any form and he say out of the Father came the son he said now we're not we don't believe in eternal sonship for the Catholic charts now but said he was a son well father and son there's two of them they trying to express one God then we spent months waited spent months talking on Genesis 1:26 and 27 and try to understand and the Bible said let us make man in our image and notice he made a male and a female in his image because Eve was in Adam remember remember the quotes he was in Adam in theophany he said she was in that original creation for the one 26 and 27 he said and she was in him in the literal creation because she was in his body see then the mind comes to comprehend well that would mean that had one theophany and see then that would throw the mind to pieces to try to understand then when the Prophet would come on later and he'd say or in that same quote and he said see he said God is the soul that's his soul that's he's a beating he's at the asana he's a person he's real city ain't like the wind blowing and said he created us in His image and said that man he created control the animals said see he was in theophany he said the man was theophany and he said see that's why he put a soul in a man that he didn't put in the animal he's because that soul in that man is that the offering now you got any better way of explaining that I'd love to hear it but you know what you're blinded your mind to and the biggest portion of people this message is blinded at that point they cannot follow a simple terminology that's a soul isn't theophany not the often he's up yonder not the often he's up yonder he's up in the heavens it's eternal I'm sorry to be a human being that instead of trying to figure something out I just said wait on God let me ask you a simple question what do you believe you sold you the oven there whatever it is what you what you believe yeah well see you believe that the soul is real the soul is what you are we went through the scriptures that you can't find the body of God in the Old Testament right because it was a human body but you can find the Spirit of God in the Old Testament and that or anoints people and can still even anoint and be anointed ones older than you whatever you're in but I ask you a simple question can you find the soul of God in the Old Testament because the soul is more real in the body in the spirit see do you listen to try to understand or listen to try to argue which is the point when we read that scripture in Corinthians I'll get to that point and we'll just say this but just let you look at what you're talking about in Corinthians where it comes from you know it says if this earthly tabernacle were dissolved we have one waiting is it waiting is it there waiting or is it there when you pass away which one is it when you pass away it can go die right if this earthly Tabernacle were you've done got to if to question your point you done got the word to establish that the only way you're gonna get dark I'm way you're gonna get to that point over there is to die alright didn't is that true for everybody we've got to admit its truth for everybody and everybody is standing here body spirit so they don't have somewhere to go to up there they have a place that's not dire until they die will you agree with that it is not art to you die so sinner what's the problem we say in the sinner and at the Alpha knee which is it so see there's more to that scripture than just thinking if there's earthly Tabernacle we're dissolved we have one waiting do have one waiting up there well it says it's waiting I'll remind you I have read 17 times in the beginning was the word the Word was with God we always talked that is being with God meant God was over here and someone's over here right I mean trinitarianism takes that right there's something over here there's something over here because it's with God but then we read that it says in the word what's God now that erases your thought of a God and another person if you listening and listening sensibly the autumn say that erase is that with don't so it don't mean one sitting here and one sitting here it means something took place that cannot be explained with human words and God saying in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God that's not two people it's like your prophet will say let us make man showing him this last night the Bible said let us make my hand better brendham said he was talking to another being oh man you really build and you really can't comprehend when Jesus was standing here on earth praying to a father that was in heaven he's the noise in him no he was in heaven according to the Bible I know he was in him that's no problem but there was also something related what you see we just take what we want to think about instead of listening for God to express to us what are you saying so then a sinner has a place to go when he dies it ain't up there until he dies or over there or down there or wherever he goes so Christian doesn't have something up there waiting well that scripture then would apply to them everybody world in wouldn't it now let's see if you can follow that song how can it apply to everybody in the world when it's got some more words on the end of it this earthly time when I could wear this off we have one waiting eternal in the heavens mr. Bible that scripture is only talking of born-again Christian it don't change a thing he calls a sinner as a soul that's his being that's what he is he has a place to go we went over and over the Bible says spirits in prison right they don't say souls in prison since Paris in prison who was brother branham wrong when he said that spirit is soul and city spirit went back to God who gave it but said his soul went to hell city spirit couldn't go because that would mean God would be dying then we've been through these would you listening so everybody in the world is a body spirit and soul in everybody when they die as a place to go to let her run said once pulling you upward rug pulling downward one of the two you going somewhere but my point is is it dire before you get down no it's in you but brother you you seem to think so it's just like me you tell me why not what am I not thinking that if you could see my soul you'd be seeing me numb about getting the scripture with it when that what Jesus said didn't Jesus say if you've seen me you've seen the father so was the father looked like see that's why I love the message the father looked like the Sun right father is not an old man with a beard and a son the young man so if it's right and Jesus is right if you've seen me you've seen the father so the father and the son looks identical why because they are the same person that simple and see what I love about the message now let's take the message through that little point right there let's just take the message of that little point and to see what we've had brought to our benefit that people just life that's you about it I preached over and over and over how real God was before the world message after message of how real he was to get us away from that God is the spirit and the spirit don't hide don't fall into it it's just mr. spirit my spirit in an animal has a form you ever heard this one well brother Hiles gonna like sister cleaner probably ready knowing I doubt if in the rest if you'd know it you take a horse higher and put it in water and it'll move when you touch it did you know that I'm gonna have to get too tight with listening to the other night cuz it what brother I'm saying I'll be glad to give it he said you put a horsehair in the water and touch it it'll move he said be cause now listen to it he said because it is a spirit higher spirit well that's what he says that's what I'm saying see in old timers old enough with life ask you about it cuz I remember it I remember saying something one time with dinner that meeting in maislin and her brother dawn run was once talking about it said talking about sugar tits well this old man he if we did not nobody else in the meeting but they have old man that old man was sitting there and when he said sugar tits he just started dying laughing you know what he knows what it was it was coffee with sugar in it and putting the rag and give it to the baby you know different for different ways but it was okay we've had a profit nota lot okay but listen let's take a simple illustration and follow that illustration through to see that our soul is what you really are and if you die it's your soul going somewhere it's not you going to a soul or another body it's your soul that leaves this body I mean over and over and over it we're giving you the quote from brother Branham saying Jesus his soul went to hell - preach - this souls in prison when the Bible had called his spirits in prison but yet Brethren called it souls and Princeton and those people that were especially when he come into paradise they're coming back up Abraham said Sarah come here that's the man we fed the cave - what do you look like said you've seen me you've seen the father the father and the son looks at identical alive then why are you life and the people on the tapes and I why would you life in any way of saying that brother Branham says the closest thing picture of Christ is Hoffman's so what does garden look like the closest thing we can see of Hoffman's that's what he looks like you remember when he raised what was wrong with Mary the reason she didn't recognize because you didn't read her an old man with bloody proof commencement I'm blood all over him he's raised as a young man stand she thought he was a gardener he wouldn't all bloody and beat-up and scarred up he was in a glorified state or some way transforming because the scripture covers it why would you make light of somebody thinking that their guard looks like Hoffman's Hoffman caught something and painted it I thank Joe for doing this other one I told you we're gonna put a picture up on this other side over here and be different you know and and I hope you see what's over here is that 33 picture in boost into work the pillar fire coming down the angels of God and things you know like the brother preached last night and today see that's mean something personal to me it means that we know what God looks like now you have something that comes up to you and some kind of thing in the middle of the night and it's all twisted up where it says I'm God bow down and worship me now you've got a right to say get out of here you ugly mug no you don't look God don't look like that would just be careful about the one that can impersonate how close he can get listen nobody's got to say to you what does it know what are you getting at okay if you can believe that your soul is the real you and it regardless whether your Center assigned don't lay no difference the minute you die you step into a body not step into a body like stepping it's the body that goes huh it's the soul of the individual it is your theophany let's see it's easy to think about guarding the theophany I've been very very careful to make sure it stated correctly a sinner's theophany is not eternal no that's it so that's his being he said well if you've seen a theophany of a sinner what would you say you ain't gonna make no doctor or not ever but he could be as old as mud he could be 90 years old you could see him cuz you had no right to connection to anything of eternal life so whatever he looks like that's what he'd be you know but to a Christian see if some way God could pull from me and stand my theophany here you wouldn't see a 77 year old man why because I have the connection to eternal life that's the one thing it's been the hardest thing for me to try to get people to see see me you see we don't have to wait till we get some words out a sinner has to wait officials you even has to wait to oh when I was cute they got to feel silly Old Testament they got fished a little technical Old Testament Saints that didn't raise and things back there goes the Bible said all of them denied they have no right to any form of eternal life they have to be given eternal life but the day you're born again your soul is just as eternal as God is because God has imparted to you into your soul that at that time would be 75 say to me in listening listen close if I wasn't born again my soul that looked just like I am right but today I'm born again that soul becomes eternal and there is my real theophany because it's theophany simply means a body a body for you to go to when you die when you step out of this one you step into that one but to catch up it is to everybody but the bride the bride steps into eternal life here we don't have to fool with thinking about a body eternal in the heavens here's the heavens heavenly places is right here in your being today so you may be 70 years old if you're a born-again believer that soul is eternal it's already in the image of what it was supposed to be so your soul is your theophany it's your soul and the soul is more real than either they don't say this body or spirit that's in he said the soul that sinneth it shall die cuz that's the real you but get the difference we don't have to wait now I'm not throwing off on nobody but then you know yourself he was back there and listen let's Baptist which preach there's none good no not one one week and the next week we preached be therefore perfect one time we'd have everybody in heaven by the time we'd have everybody inhale come we would know and we say I hope we'll say to believers say maybe I'm saved oh I'm saved I want my confession to be I'm saved he's like I say you say I'm healed I got cancer but I'm healed I want you to know I'm healed you'll go pretty good for a little while the matter a while you don't whip that cancer you'll start saying well you know I believe I better go to the doctor bruise you didn't have faith to start with get a mental conception most Christianity is based on a mental conception that's why they're not born again it's just a confession but the Bible says brother do if I confess with my mouth and believe in my heart that I'm saying yes if you mean it if it's real as the brother said if it went that foot down from the head down into the soul and then it's real but if it don't you just as lost as you ever were see the soul is where you go when you leave here death takes you there you go to a place one way or the other brother Randall my love the way says thing he said held not even held tonight right now fire burning inside he says just to follow their way you know there's something are for keep you but to a Christian his soul is already eternal your born-again Christian you're so he's just as eternal his guardian why because God's life come in and made your soul eternal God like to Adam breathe into your nostrils in the new birth the breath of eternal law I said like a head of God we'll get back to him he said yeah but I came time don't worry about it he's got his place you're not in the body of Christ these are for the reason yeah but listen he said well what are you talking about I'm talking about one time your prophet said one day if it wasn't for the fact of a holding power some way he said you did speak a world into existence and go to it never that one now you started going wrong he did speak a world existence and go God he said we can't be done would you know what he told it right did he say you don't have the power to create a world he didn't say that he said the power is there but it's controlled by how a higher power to keep you from speaking it when I finish the message I hope you see one time I hope you see one time for certain if you have eternal life that eternal life was always has been and always will be the Creator that's why you have a right to speak the word come on are we in the scripts the scripts you don't say if God says to the mountain he's brought around say you're a little Creator don't lose me now way to the end of the thought to where we can find out something so we went through all of the things it's a prophet gave talking about the soul was the first thing that God created it was the soul and he said he created the one twenty six twenty seven million that's what he created but it was a one person point standing there we went up there is a little bitty spots identities her anything we went over and over it we were in Jesus Christ and if we wasn't in Jesus Christ we never will pay true alright think about it something brother branham saying he said god's first creation was himself you remember that quote boy that blows the mind knowing that God's first creation is himself well he created him there's another one of them with you know Word was with God you still got see two thoughts clear it down to one there is no scripture now watch it when we get to it in a minute there is no scripture about the father creating it stipulates who the Creator is because is keeping it right but there's no scripture that says the father don't create well because the father and the sons of self same person it's his form these years but you know yourself that I've tried to explain over and over for 40 years people say all God was he poured in the crotch all Christ in the church take her back to the Garden of Eden I see you don't realize what you're saying her sermon Ida sermon all means all it means every time all is all within oh god was he poured into Christ but ain't no God no more he only exists in Christ he's that rod that's what you're reading the scripture there's a quote from the Prophet you know Christ is poured in the church sweet Christ anymore he's got Church well I think about that well what'd you think about Oh God pour it into Christ you ain't got no God no it's all in Christ and all Christ pour it in the church you got no Christ no more so you only got Church well you're silly I agree we would you think about that is what I said true you've just done away you see God don't do that I tried my best to get the brothers years ago some of them here even argued with me about it I said just please do one time whatever you do with the condescending of God don't do away with anything because the more God condescends downward the greater he is the more in manifestation he is as he conned us in down it's not doing away with he's condescending down word to you and I she didn't don't just take the father and do away with him and put him in the son brother I didn't say that he said a part of God went out called a son he said in that son was the logos with the often II the speech now you'll see why it says Jesus Christ created all things but just don't do away with anything in the father don't be that narrow-minded I say that for my heart of love it understand it don't be so narrow-minded till you said well cuz you got the same thing you said in the beginning was the word Word was with God so I mean there's two of them cuz it's with in brenna random would say let us make man he says he he was talking to another being you know stride father decided not to people these two manifestations not people are personalities it's manifestation so in the beginning as I preached to you over and over and over the great eternal God all those attributes all those things back before the world ever begun he was the great eternal the divine said a part went out he said a son of God he said God has stepped over in another form now did he step over to empty up a place back here those you'll never understand why Jesus would stand on this earth and say my Father which art in heaven he said what was he doing he was communicating he was communicating alright here is the father before the world all the attributes all the things we covered I told you we get to the Creator eventually don't do away with the father just leave it leave it that all you thinking that leave it but out of the father comes the same God in another form it don't do away with that goddess back there it don't do away with that father it just makes a way to bring it into manifestation and he brings in that he called him he said out of the father came to son now the son was the low-cost at the Alpha knee to create and that we were back there with him come anymore you won't I still got a lot to read if you want we were back dire when he created man as a soul not as many souls he created one soul are stepped over in the form of a soul he didn't create it he didn't create a Sun it was whatever was needed from God stepped over into another form to make his plan come to pass you remember how he gave the little drawing that we covered it with two lines in two parts and see brother Branham said the first thing God created was angels Missy angels had a beginning angels are not eternal they're ministering spirits made to minister under the heirs of salvation they got a job that's why they could shout like everything when they knew what God was gonna do and he was gonna come forth and human flesh himself and walk on this earth just don't do all they were the father just leave it alone yeah but I can't see a father Darden shun over here you better be able to see something because if not you sure our Trinity but if you didn't let God just stay where he's at and then you can have him to step over into another form to be the create taller all things were made by the word right and that word is the eternal God that word is the eternal God the word created all things Jesus didn't create all the time the father didn't create all things he moved over into another form called a son son and father can communicate why can't you see where he said let us make man let me use it this way first we won't trick your mind word and spirit are one when he said let us make man that was exactly right go listen did he make the man now listen did he make the man plural - no but inside of him was - there's the image of God the plural the plurality that's why man can't understand it it looks like there's many gods good it looks like pluralities when he made man in his own image he made a male and a female in his image but his first creation was angels and they worshipped him he become God now you come to Genesis 1 now you got in Genesis 1 it says God created all the things God created all the times ok then it says the Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created heaven in there this is 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image us make man in our that sounds like plurality doesn't it sounds like - it is in one way because it's father and son remember the point now leave the father would let something step over or whatever you want to call it form change with it then you step over in another form and begin to create and call it a son that's what your prophet did he said he's like a child playing before the father's door and said he said let her be they just flung out a world who we read in Genesis says God we read in Genesis 1:26 it says God 1:27 so God created man in his own image Malachi 2 and 10 hath not one God created us what is that smell co2 it t-half not one God created us so they were one God neighbor one God one creator mark when he comes over in at 13 and 18 or 19 beginning of the creation was God created unto this time God crea john wong says in the beginning was the word word with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made Colossians 1 in 13 who had delivered us from the power of darkness and that's translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him the firstborn of every creature we're sons and daughters by Jesus was we come by Spoken and Jesus come right straight he not to be spoken he was that just moved in another form for by him we're all things made that are in heaven and that are in earth visible visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him who's he talking about Hebrews 1 God who at sundry times and divers manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets has in these last days now we're getting closer to what we want right spoken unto us by his son I mean reading his Christian getting closer to where we won't come in with Jesus Christ now let's he has in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's revelation 4:10 the four and twenty elders fall down before him they said on the throne and worship Him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art were the O Lord to receive glory and honor and power where thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created one God now we get to the good when it's anchors it down right Ephesians three and nine to make all men see what is the fellowship with a mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden God who created all things but Jesus Christ who's the creator not a god the son the son of God we don't use God the Son God that doesn't work right it's the son of God we don't believe in eternal sonship we believe in the eternal God ship no quoting rid of random so what happened our leave the father existing where he's at and let a part of God as a prophet said come out and would be called a son lo gosh theophany word and let him speak when he stood on this earth Peter said the greatest thing who demands Jesus to Peter who do men see how the son of man he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he said Jesus you created all things that's what he's just saying all things were made by Jesus Christ so in Genesis it was the word that spoke you said let there be and created the world it was the word that spoke and said let's make man in her own image community getting back to the father how do we make him don't ever lose that communication because you're going to get out of the scripture because when Jesus then came to earth he prayed to the Father he said that was just the flesh wasn't it was it just a flesh wound would he say now there's my soul trouble yet for this cause I can't one true and living God he Jesus was the word according John 1:14 wot and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the Son of God was back there not his sonship as another person the back door is a part of God they would come forward to be the Creator or their quote the Prophet Jesus never come to give us an inheritance he come to pay the price the inheritance was eternal life before the foundation of the world right okay so he was in him before the world he was chosen are you listening see then if God is in you in the new birth why would you worry about mark 11 in that mark 11 work is youth if you say to this mountain he says it doesn't say if God says it if you say do you realize what I'm saying you have within you the eternal God that created the world because listen the lies creation of mankind you remember was why that they kept calling Jesus on a man got around and said the only way he could be father was to become the son of man that son of man stood on this earth and sewed the children of the kingdom you remember that message preached a couple of messages on it that that word from the Son of Man so de-seed Jesus stood on earth right before his ascension he made a mighty statement he breathed on the disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost but around takes that spoken word and reading the seat he says bribed borned by the breath of God you realize he sold you he sold you he called your name sister Cathy went back dire when he was walking the shores of Galilee he sold you into being from that one that was back there coming down now to a multiple form and they went to Pentecost and received the Holy Ghost and it made their souls eternal because when he said he breathed on them the prophet said it he said that was a promise they didn't get the Holy Ghost right then why cause Jesus hadn't died he said that was a promise he said bride born by the word of God he said the promise now can I back up to another message when we preach that Adam and Eve was told multiply and replenish the earth they would have brought forth the spiritual mankind had sin not entered they would have brought forth by the spoken word human bodies for us to lived in had there been no sin but now here's where you're going so you lose the me right there because you're not listening I'm quoting brother Branham to the tee and you're not listening because your mind says it can't be no other way because sin was already there the tree of knowledge was dying in the garden I got a sense I know that but your prophet said that it was an ongoing Commission or Adam and Eve till multiply to replenish the earth okay this read this and come on musicians with you see I keep a lot of notes but they don't never get to people don't internet at least they get him off the message the spoken word is original seed paragraph 53 and 54 Adams bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the earth it was an oncoming thing a promise see you could wait when words regional seed 7576 if God said multiply to the bride to Adams bride and replenish multiply and replace their that was God's Commission and she would have done it but she couldn't wait she hybrid it he said she would have done it both words original seed paragraph 1 47 Jesus coming that seed he proved it everything that Adam lost Jesus was and he is the correct Eve would have finally brought that crop child forth but she hybrid but words regional seed forgot 160 162 if Eve would have have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her multiply and replenish but she couldn't wait you maybe thought I was crazy too saying that we're born by spiritual multiplication marriage and divorce paragraph 230 know this ye said to Adam before sex was ever in induced or introduced multiply and replenish the earth when he was yet in the beginning when he was yet both male and female in himself dark shows then that the bride has got to come from the word by spiritual multiplication that's why you got to have a preacher you gotta have somebody bring it to you come on I don't do it all the way you sister's supposed to speak to each other so let's don't run all the garbage the sisters speak to the sisters they can carry the gospel right you believe that the women will say Amen but didn't do away with a thoughtful ministry that's all right no problem you ain't gonna do away with my job mine was settled before the world ever becoming now I hope you listen to what I'm saying with one final point if you will leave and not bring all of God over to the next forum and then dump you ball over the next phone if you'll just simply leave the father and let a part of him move over and be the son the logos the theophany the creator and then you can see why Jesus would stand on this earth and pray my father or your father he's the same one and he prayed that will be done in earth he was still praying to the Father well now you got it ready again no he's praying back to the original because that way then listen when the word is revealed to you and there's quickened the word and the spirit are one so when it says let us make man you know who that was back there they said that father to son mother son said let us make man that's not Trinitarian Israel it's communication between because I'm gonna finish it with what the Prophet said when they asked him the question about Jesus pray unto the father he said who do you pray to who do you pray to do you have to pray out loud is he up somewhere well no you can just talk to him quietly can't you not in the middle of the night and see I can go through the my house and I say father thank you so who are you referring to I'm referred to my father so now I know who is that he's waiting on us to finish this route and then the bible says that the son himself shall become subject that God may be all in all when you're standing there didn't you see him as he is you will see Jesus but who's the Hall at all he's in all standing there but he's in are all standing there with him cuz that's his children Nestene well we got rid the create or is still here you still here with us God's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last stage we have nice profits message God Seneca would you listen to
