[3:58] amen we're heading toward a real change
[4:00] though we're heading toward a change of
[4:02] the
[4:03] body and we sure appreciate the Lord
[4:29] and they're predestinated to that too so
[4:32] we want to be
[4:33] predestinated as we're going to talk
[4:35] about and I I appreciate them playing
[4:37] that adoption because that's what we're
[4:39] going to move into we're going to we're
[4:40] going to not get off of the transition
[4:43] to Perfection but I think we've come to
[4:45] the part to now we need to learn how to
[4:48] be perfect and to learn how to be
[4:50] perfect we must come to adoption first
[4:54] all right we must come to adoption first
[4:57] and this is going to be just a an
[5:00] overview and then Sunday we'll get into
[5:02] our to to the meat of it but adoption is
[5:05] again as we said it's a
[5:07] requirement these virtues are a
[5:11] requirement for this end time for us to
[5:14] come to full adoption to where our name
[5:19] is as good in the checkbook as the
[5:20] father's and then all of a sudden
[5:23] there's a transformation that we get to
[5:26] sign
[5:27] it we get to give it
[5:30] all right so we'll get to that though in
[5:32] just a little bit just remember this is
[5:34] coming up baby baptism uh little
[5:36] Emerson's going to be bapt I mean going
[5:38] to be baptized well I was in a Methodist
[5:41] Church last Sunday okay I'm trying to
[5:42] get over all
[5:44] that I hope none of's watching but I'm
[5:46] telling you folks praise God we know
[5:49] what we
[5:51] know I mean praise God we know what we
[5:55] know when brother bham said they were
[5:58] lodges now
[6:00] that's what they are it's just a meeting
[6:03] place that's it brother Donnie and
[6:04] sister Susan were there and and sister
[6:06] Regina they didn't eat donuts everybody
[6:08] else in the sanctuary did but they
[6:10] didn't eat
[6:11] donuts U they didn't recite the Apostles
[6:13] Creed I hope asked Mom if she did she
[6:15] said
[6:17] no but we stood and and we uh uh I just
[6:22] pray for
[6:23] them cuz they just don't know that's all
[6:26] they know recite the Apostles Creed
[6:29] recite the doxology like Aaron said you
[6:31] know it's it's a method I mean John
[6:34] Wesley that's why they're called
[6:35] Methodist but buddy they had a method
[6:37] and that was what they stuck to and uh
[6:40] until I got in a pull
[6:42] pit but anyway we didn't say anything
[6:45] that hurt anybody and and they enjoyed
[6:47] it they they nodded a little loud every
[6:48] once in a while but um we're going to
[6:52] have a baby dedication they were all

[9:46] Anna sister Anna marona and them well
[9:49] they stayed in a nice one and we stayed
[9:50] in a nice one and uh but we're going to
[9:53] stay in the motel with you guys this
[9:55] year so uh let's just remember also
[9:57] remember that church in prayer sure
[9:59] enough that Methodist Church they're
[10:00] looking for a pastor they're they're
[10:02] sheep without Shepherd and they're
[10:04] really looking for somebody and um we
[10:07] sure would love to have the building
[10:08] they had cuz it holds about 250 people
[10:10] and ain't that right so yeah the the the
[10:14] the stage was twice this size at least
[10:17] maybe more you couldn't hey yeah you
[10:21] couldn't lean over and go
[10:24] see you'd have to send a text to the
[10:27] person over on this end
[10:29] to change the uh to change the cord
[10:32] because you'd be so far away from each
[10:34] other but just pray for them uh they
[10:36] went through a fire years ago and the
[10:38] reason where I think I told you but I'll
[10:40] tell you again um a witch went in and
[10:43] burnt the building down burnt the church
[10:45] down the original Church in about 1998
[10:48] or 99 somewhere in there
[10:50] 2000 well there's a a girl named Rita
[10:52] Bush which went to was teaching school
[10:54] with Anna and they got together and they
[10:57] had a need and their need was Sunday
[10:58] School tables and chairs so we bought
[11:01] them all Sunday school tables and chairs
[11:03] for the young ones and put them
[11:05] downstairs Unfortunately they got seven
[11:07] or eight rooms down there now and they
[11:09] don't even have a Sunday school class so
[11:11] but they're sitting down there uh to be
[11:13] used when if the church gets any bigger
[11:16] so um you love the Lord God thank you
[11:19] for praying for us we appreciate you
[11:20] being um cordial with Brother David he's
[11:23] a good brother I love Brother David he
[11:24] just won't ever hurt you and he'll
[11:26] always inspire you and he's a he's a
[11:28] really good brother and we really
[11:30] appreciate y'all taking care of him so
[11:33] if you got your Bible let's turn to
[11:34] Hebrews 5 verse
[11:38] 8 just remember these
[11:40] things these announcements Sunday will
[11:43] be a little bit busy that'll be all
[11:48] right let's bow our heads Heavenly
[11:51] Father Lord thank you for
[11:59] knowing that there'd be a group in the
[12:00] end time as we were reading quote back
[12:02] there from brother brandham that he knew
[12:05] that we would want it so he had it here
[12:07] for us Lord you knew we would want this
[12:11] we would want this more than life itself
[12:14] Lord we don't take it softly and lightly
[12:18] Lord we take it with
[12:19] reverence that you'll meet us in this
[12:21] house Lord if we'll do the things we're
[12:23] supposed to do and father that you'll
[12:26] meet us in our house even in our homes
[12:28] and our jobs Lord that we don't have to
[12:30] come to a building just to hear from you
[12:33] father because it's a personal
[12:35] relationship with you father be with us
[12:37] now as we read the scripture bless the
[12:40] hearers Lord be with the speaker father
[12:43] and you speak the words tonight that the
[12:44] people need to hear forgive Lord the
[12:46] ones that are sin sick father be with
[12:48] the ones that are that are sick at home
[12:50] and can't come Lord I pray that you'd be
[12:52] with them Father and bless them ever be
[12:54] with us now in Jesus name amen so we're
[12:57] going to switch a little gears but we
[12:59] got to talk about adoption because if
[13:01] the third poll is pertaining to adoption
[13:05] then we've got to cover adoption uh
[13:07] brother Dale's covered it many times but
[13:08] we got a lot of new people here um so
[13:11] we're going to cover it again we won't
[13:12] cover it much tonight we're just going
[13:13] to set a basis for it so let's read
[13:15] Hebrews 5 verse 8 though he were a son
[13:19] now this is Jesus Christ though he were
[13:22] a son yet learn he obedience by the
[13:24] things which he
[13:26] suffered look and being made perfect now
[13:29] remember Jesus Christ in Soul and Spirit
[13:32] was perfect but his body was not perfect
[13:35] yet okay all right so when we come to to
[13:39] wit the Redemption of the body what
[13:40] we're talking about as we get a little
[13:42] bit later on that is coming to the
[13:43] Perfection that our body will even be
[13:45] perfect while we're standing on this
[13:47] imperfect Earth everybody with me and
[13:50] being made perfect he became the author
[13:53] of Eternal salvation unto all of them
[13:56] that obey him second Timothy 2:8 and you
[14:00] can be seated remember that Jesus Christ
[14:02] of the seed of David was raised from the
[14:04] dead according to my gospel wow what
[14:06] about that wherein I suffer trouble as
[14:09] an evildoer even unto bonds but the word
[14:11] of God is not bound therefore I Endure
[14:15] all things for the elect sake that they
[14:17] may also obtain the Salvation which is
[14:19] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory it is
[14:22] a faithful saying for if we be dead with
[14:25] him we shall also live with him if we
[14:28] suffer we shall also reign with him but
[14:31] if we deny him he also will deny us all
[14:35] right if we believe not yet he abideth
[14:37] faithful he cannot deny himself he can't
[14:41] change he can't he can't have a
[14:43] different thought he can't say oops I
[14:45] need to back up he knows what he's
[14:47] talking about we've just got to do what
[14:49] as I was telling him there we just got
[14:50] to plug into the outlet the electricity
[14:52] is there the eternal life is there you
[14:53] just got to plug into it you may be
[14:55] seing the Lord that his Blessing to the
[14:57] reading the word now if we suffer
[15:00] we shall also Reign so brother B tells
[15:02] us and we've done we've read this many
[15:04] many
[15:05] times he talks about power without
[15:07] character or power with character if so
[15:11] be that we suffer with him we may also
[15:12] be glorified together we're going to get
[15:15] into Romans 8 this Sunday for I reog not
[15:17] that the sufferings of this present time
[15:20] are not worthy now look at Paul not
[15:23] worthy to be compared with the glory
[15:25] which shall be revealed in us us as
[15:27] Christians we got to see the Long Haul
[15:29] because remember remember those who
[15:31] endure to the end will be saved those
[15:35] who endure to the end will be
[15:37] saved not the ones that stop off not the
[15:41] ones that get sidetracked the ones that
[15:43] endure to the end will be saved that's
[15:45] thus sayith the
[15:48] Lord unless we suffer with him we cannot
[15:51] reign with him now look if Jesus Christ
[15:53] had to suffer so are we going to suffer
[15:57] you say I don't like that well you know
[15:58] what probably didn't like it either he
[16:00] actually said in the garden if you can
[16:02] take this away from me I surely don't
[16:04] want to do this but nevertheless thy
[16:06] will be done why he had a victory the
[16:09] reason for this is that character simply
[16:11] is never made without suffering you say
[16:15] man I can't now listen you got to go
[16:17] back to the part to where Jesus said or
[16:19] or God said I'll never put no more on
[16:20] you than you can stand you just don't
[16:22] know how much you can
[16:23] stand till you go through a trial when
[16:25] you go through a trial when you come out
[16:27] on the very on the other end of it if if
[16:29] a Christian comes out at the end of it
[16:30] as we've said many times before it
[16:32] doesn't ruin
[16:34] you it'll never ruin a Christian it will
[16:38] make you stronger it will make you know
[16:40] why you're in the will of God it'll make
[16:42] you know why you went through that
[16:44] you'll know personally they won't nobody
[16:46] else know it but you you'll know when
[16:48] you go through a trial everybody's
[16:50] praying for you everybody's with you
[16:52] everybody's there with you to be
[16:54] whatever we need to be but you're alone
[16:55] by yourself more than anybody else
[16:59] so character is a victory not a gift so
[17:02] God's not handing out
[17:05] character you got to earn
[17:08] it character is a victory not a gift a
[17:10] man without character can't Reign
[17:13] because power apart from character is
[17:16] satanic but Power with character is fit
[17:19] to rule and now what are we ruling we're
[17:21] ruling
[17:22] this and since he wants us to share even
[17:25] his throne on the same now watch on the
[17:27] same basis that he overcome
[17:29] and is sat down in his father's Throne
[17:31] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[17:35] and the little temporary sufferings we
[17:37] go through now is not worthy to be
[17:39] compared to the tremendous Glory that
[17:41] will be what revealed in us when he
[17:43] comes oh what Treasures are laid up for
[17:45] those who are willing to enter into his
[17:47] kingdom through much
[17:51] tribulation the trials of our faith
[17:53] being much more precious than gold
[17:56] that's what God wants us to do but when
[17:59] we come to a place where God is pleased
[18:02] with all that he's going to put a seal
[18:05] on us he's going to adopt us because
[18:09] remember I and I'll I'll I'll have the
[18:12] quote Sunday but I didn't bring it here
[18:13] but brother Brown says look your new
[18:15] birth is not your
[18:17] adoption your new birth is bringing you
[18:19] into the family of God you were born a
[18:22] son born again a son all right everybody
[18:25] with me born again a
[18:26] son you born a son of your par the first
[18:29] time now you born a Son of God from the
[18:31] Son of God this time by the new birth
[18:34] but you can have the new birth and not
[18:36] be adopted but you can't get adopted
[18:38] without having the new birth that's why
[18:40] the new birth is the most important
[18:41] thing because it will it will help you
[18:44] to get to the next step but if you don't
[18:45] have it you don't know how because power
[18:48] without character what is that power
[18:49] that power is the holy ghost power power
[18:52] without that
[18:54] character you might do something wrong
[18:56] with it but God knows when you come to
[18:59] when brother bam came and we'll get to
[19:01] the steps of the adoption later on when
[19:03] he came to a place to where I believe
[19:06] and we'll see it here in a minute where
[19:08] God came to a place to where he sealed
[19:09] him and told him said told the world
[19:11] said if you're going to get it you're
[19:12] going to get it from this man right here
[19:13] cuz remember that's what brother Brown
[19:15] said that happened on Mount
[19:17] Transfiguration Jesus up there said
[19:20] behold you know the Son of God and whom
[19:22] I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him he said
[19:24] from now on you're going to hear what
[19:26] that guy says and I'm going to speak
[19:28] through that guy in other words God's
[19:29] going to speak through that guy so
[19:30] brother brandham when he comes off that
[19:32] mountain God has sealed him and told him
[19:35] placed him in a place of adoption where
[19:38] whatever he said was what was going to
[19:40] be God God was going to back up now he
[19:42] backed him up a long time
[19:44] ago and the things that he did you know
[19:46] the healings and all that but we're
[19:48] talking about getting the correct
[19:50] Doctrine right getting the correct
[19:51] scriptures right getting the right me
[19:54] right message right to bring the son of
[19:56] man on the scene because the son of man
[19:59] was
[20:00] perfect his words were perfect he didn't
[20:04] make a mistake he didn't have a
[20:05] different Doctrine it was the doctrine
[20:08] sure of the Apostles but remember we'll
[20:10] look at in just a few minutes The
[20:12] Headstone was rejected now what are you
[20:14] talking about when you talk about
[20:15] headstone Stone means what
[20:19] Revelation it's not a rock sitting
[20:21] somewhere but it's a allegory of
[20:24] building something and putting a
[20:26] headstone on top of it that is the head
[20:28] that hold it all together that's where
[20:29] everything comes up to a what a head so
[20:33] the head Revelation was Jesus
[20:36] Christ the head Revelation there's no
[20:38] other Revelation Satan's not your
[20:40] revealer angels are not the revealer of
[20:43] the word God is the only one that
[20:44] reveals the word now what does he do he
[20:46] speaks to people to get you to listen
[20:49] and turn and look cuz remember his
[20:52] message was a what a shout a
[20:55] trump hey the message is here God's
[20:59] telling us the message he told us where
[21:01] it's come he told us where it's coming
[21:02] through it's coming through a prophet in
[21:04] the end time had to be a
[21:07] prophet so Ephesians 1:3 says blessed be
[21:10] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[21:12] Christ who has blessed us with all
[21:14] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[21:16] in Christ according as he ha chosen us
[21:19] now look he chose us in him not of
[21:25] him because God chose he chooses Every
[21:27] Soul cuz he's the only one that can make
[21:29] one but he knows that people won't take
[21:32] it the people won't that they'll accept
[21:33] it or reject it and he did according to
[21:37] his for knowledge he knew you would or
[21:39] wouldn't he's just not going to pull you
[21:41] through a tube and make you be a
[21:43] Christian he don't do his business that
[21:47] way according as he ha chosen Us in him
[21:51] before the foundation of the world where
[21:53] was that c Gene in him before the
[21:56] foundation of the world it just come to
[21:58] development down here when you got the
[22:01] new birth you got what he saw you was
[22:02] going to get before the foundation of
[22:04] the world to me that's so
[22:06] simple but we were alienated though you
[22:08] got to see that we were not born again
[22:10] when we were born the first time why
[22:12] would we have to have to be born
[22:14] again we don't have to
[22:16] be in darkness with these things a lot
[22:20] of these things are terminologies that
[22:21] we say but you were lost you were a
[22:24] sinner I know I was I don't know where
[22:26] people get that they were they were some
[22:28] some happy something that that God spoke
[22:30] to them since they were sucking
[22:35] bottles they might have y'all may be a
[22:37] bunch of goody two shoes but I'm sure I
[22:39] wasn't mom praise the Lord she said no
[22:49] um all your mothers would say the same
[22:51] thing so I ain't worried about it every
[22:54] one of you m was
[22:56] ago but we needed to be saved we needed
[23:00] salvation we were on this side of the
[23:03] chasm but what was on this side of the
[23:05] chasm listen what was on this side of
[23:07] the chasm is what got
[23:10] us took hold but it took hold down here
[23:13] but he saw it take hold down here
[23:15] therefore he could by for knowledge
[23:17] predetermine everything where like
[23:20] brother rown said he's not going to pull
[23:21] you through a tube or he's not going to
[23:22] make you do it so you do have a choice
[23:25] you've got to plug into the outlet
[23:30] now look according as he has chosen Us
[23:33] in him before the foundation of the
[23:35] world Now watch how predetermined we are
[23:38] to come to a place that we should be
[23:41] holy and Without Blame before him in
[23:46] love having predestinated us to the
[23:48] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[23:51] himself according to the good pleasure
[23:53] of his will and we'll read in just a few
[23:55] minutes brother R said his will was to
[23:57] adopt you his will was to make get you
[24:00] to a place to where he can leave the
[24:03] company to you and take a
[24:05] vacation everybody with
[24:08] me not looking back and going I hope he
[24:12] hope he writes the right check I hope he
[24:13] don't buy this I hope he don't destroy
[24:15] my company God's not that way he knows
[24:18] what's going to happen and he knows what
[24:20] move you'll make before you make
[24:22] it that's why we have to have character
[24:25] by suffering he watches us through all
[24:28] these trials and tribulations to see how
[24:30] we'll react he knows how we'll react you
[24:33] just don't know how you'll
[24:35] react so now the word adoption means to
[24:39] set put or
[24:42] place all right to set fix or establish
[24:46] to set forth to establish or ordain we
[24:49] have been ordained to adoption or we're
[24:52] receiving the spirit of adoption we'll
[24:54] get to it in Romans the spirit of
[24:55] adoption you're receiving you have the
[24:58] spirit that will get you listen You'll
[25:00] have the spirit in you that will get you
[25:01] to adoption at your new
[25:03] birth all right that's what the Bible's
[25:06] saying you will have the spirit that'll
[25:08] get you there if you've got the spirit
[25:11] he'll get you there but remember you are
[25:13] in between all
[25:15] that you can stop
[25:19] it you'll never stop the will of God but
[25:21] the will of God saw somebody make it and
[25:23] somebody not make it very simple
[25:28] all right what the Holy Ghost was given
[25:30] for we're in a day back there that
[25:32] wasn't half as smart as today think
[25:33] about that that's
[25:37] 1959 think of what he saw then and we're
[25:41] looking at
[25:42] now we're in a day now back there they
[25:45] wasn't half as smart as today they
[25:47] couldn't make an atomic bomb or an
[25:48] automobile they didn't have science and
[25:50] things we have now M things are
[25:52] mysterious things to try and say man
[25:54] blowed together by some dust and so
[25:56] forth take some analysis and try to
[25:58] prove it make in infidels out of people
[26:01] but now when we need it now watch when
[26:03] we need it the spirit of God raises a
[26:05] standard what is it he's pouring in his
[26:07] spirit so what's he doing is in the end
[26:09] time this is the time of
[26:11] adoption all right Luther couldn't do it
[26:14] Weser couldn't do it the reformers
[26:16] couldn't do it it had to come through a
[26:18] prophet that's why a prophet had to come
[26:20] on the scene a prophet had to tell us
[26:22] and direct us because remember God's not
[26:24] going to say any tell anything to his
[26:27] children or people except It Be by a
[26:29] prophet that's in Amos what is Amos 2
[26:31] and9 he'll do nothing he's got to reveal
[26:34] it to a prophet first and then he's
[26:35] going to give it to us all right but now
[26:38] when we need it the spirit of God raises
[26:39] a standard what is it he's pouring in
[26:42] his Spirit then those who are resting
[26:44] out you under the grave are under the
[26:45] altar of God as the scripture says
[26:47] crying how long Lord how long now
[26:51] watch did you catch something right
[26:56] there that's it's not who it's that
[26:59] scripture is talking
[27:00] about you see how brother B in 1959 was
[27:03] calling
[27:05] that the bride or
[27:08] Christians come on and we get to the
[27:12] fifth seal he said that ain't what I
[27:14] thought he said that's the souls under
[27:16] the altar that's not the Christians the
[27:17] Christians already gone in the Rapture
[27:20] but partial Revelation in 1959 he was
[27:23] moving up just like me and you move up
[27:26] God was bringing him through this to
[27:28] adoption time in 1959 6061 62 to 1963
[27:34] we'll get to that in a minute now how
[27:36] long Lord how long how much longer God's
[27:38] waiting on me and you the church is
[27:40] waiting on me and you adoption time when
[27:43] God can pour into us his fullness his
[27:46] power not into one man group of
[27:49] people his power his resurrection that
[27:52] when the church and Christ become so
[27:54] close together till Christ becomes
[27:57] visible Among Us now remember he's not
[27:59] going to become visible Among Us here in
[28:04] flesh so it's in your flesh it's in us
[28:09] that's a
[28:10] requirement the world will see me no
[28:12] more but you'll see me cuz I'll be with
[28:14] you even in you till the end of the age
[28:17] till Christ becomes Vis visible Among Us
[28:20] raises the dead and we go into Rapture
[28:23] all right so let's just for a moment
[28:26] stop for a second and go back to the
[28:27] three PS and see what's going on cuz
[28:30] remember the Genesis secret mystery
[28:32] we're still talking about Genesis 126
[28:34] that's what I was telling you that's
[28:35] what came to you in your
[28:38] birth that is not all mankind I want to
[28:41] explain one more time that is not all
[28:43] mankind not everybody in the world are
[28:45] Sons and Daughters of God by birth by
[28:49] genetics spiritual
[28:51] genetics everybody with me so that is
[28:55] his children because he said Dominion
[28:57] have power power rule over Dominion
[29:00] you're my children let us make man in
[29:02] our own image and after our likeness in
[29:06] other words he likes
[29:09] us he doesn't like us he loves us we
[29:12] just sometimes don't like
[29:14] oursel and that's what gets in the
[29:17] way but that unfolds or reveals a
[29:20] mystery what is a mystery it's going to
[29:22] happen in this end time in human
[29:25] people Christ is not coming back to the
[29:27] Earth to stand on the earth and destroy
[29:30] it and do whatever he he's going to do
[29:32] it through the bride he's doing it
[29:34] through the bride his feet will not
[29:36] touch this Earth as rotten as it is it
[29:38] will not touch this Earth but he's going
[29:39] to touch your Earth he's going to depend
[29:42] on you because the adoption is what is
[29:44] placing everything he
[29:47] owns placing it on in your hands and my
[29:50] hands to see what we'll do with it and
[29:53] he knows what we'll do with it already
[29:54] we just don't know
[29:56] yet so he sent us a prophet and the
[29:58] prophet has a vision and he sees that
[30:00] there's three things that happen in his
[30:02] life there's little fish there's
[30:04] medium-sized fish and then there's a
[30:06] tent thereby with me we explained all
[30:09] that how God used him in nature because
[30:10] he was he was a prophet of nature he was
[30:13] a prophet of of one of the prophets of
[30:15] Elijah so we had the nature of Elijah
[30:17] all right so the three pulls now what is
[30:20] a pull it's a force that draws someone
[30:22] or something in a particular direction
[30:24] or course of action first and second
[30:27] pull were what we explained this last
[30:28] Sunday they were prayer lines temporary
[30:31] healing first pull was hand second pull
[30:34] was What secrets of the heart but now
[30:36] remember he he thought now he thought as
[30:39] a man he thought the third pole was
[30:41] going to be something great about that
[30:42] prayer line cuz he saw the vision of
[30:44] going into the into the tent or that
[30:46] little room in the tent and coming out
[30:48] people coming out heel
[30:51] hole but remember you keep going and he
[30:55] keeps pounding he's from 1950 something
[30:57] till till 1963 he keeps wondering what
[31:01] it is and all of a sudden God tells him
[31:03] what it
[31:05] is so Millions gathered around brother
[31:07] Randon Millions gathered around Noah
[31:09] actually I believe Noah had a crowd cuz
[31:12] they wanted to see what this idiot was
[31:13] talking about and I'm sorry but they
[31:15] thought he's an idiot cuz it never had
[31:16] rain
[31:17] before why was he building a boat and
[31:20] that boat was not big enough to carry
[31:22] all the people that was on the
[31:24] earth he only Built it by God's
[31:27] instructions in the God instructed him
[31:28] and I'm sure Noah stopped one day and
[31:30] looked at it and said all y'all ain't
[31:32] going to fit in this
[31:34] thing so he came to what a revelation
[31:37] that he was actually preaching his third
[31:40] pull was to the totally lost
[31:42] people every how many years that was up
[31:44] to the 120 that he preached he was
[31:46] preaching to people that would never get
[31:47] in the ark there was only eight people
[31:49] got in the ark and there were billions
[31:51] on the earth at the
[31:53] time and they all
[31:55] died every one of them but those eight
[31:57] people
[31:59] so Millions gathered around brother
[32:01] brandham but in the third Paul he
[32:04] understood then it was the Mysteries
[32:05] being revealed that it was going to be
[32:08] the spoken word of God that God was
[32:10] going to use a man which he used brother
[32:13] brandom and we'll get into something a
[32:14] little bit later on I'll show you where
[32:16] he transitioned from a place to where he
[32:18] would stand and say you know what I'm
[32:21] waiting on I'm waiting on
[32:24] him that was in his early part coming up
[32:27] he said I'm waiting on him I can do
[32:28] nothing without him here but if you'll
[32:30] look in 63 64 and 65 the little prayer
[32:33] lines that he called he never said that
[32:35] he went right straight into the prayer
[32:36] line he went I mean it was right
[32:38] straight into discernment he was just
[32:39] Discerning back and forth like popcorn
[32:41] he'd come to a place where he didn't now
[32:44] don't get me wrong he didn't need
[32:46] someone to come on the scene so that he
[32:48] could heal
[32:50] people that person had become so much
[32:52] involved in brother brandham till he was
[32:55] just expressing out what it was already
[32:56] inside of him he come to a adoption
[32:58] power with character what would he give
[33:01] brother brandham back in the earlier
[33:02] times I don't
[33:04] know but he waited until he knew and
[33:08] then he placed him on the
[33:11] mountain so his third poll the mysteries
[33:13] of the word sealed since Jesus
[33:17] Christ Millions left him
[33:21] Millions so now we know that the third
[33:23] pull was the opening of the seals the
[33:25] opening of the word that nobody's ever
[33:26] seen light had not shined on these
[33:28] things before it was hidden mysteries
[33:31] but they were
[33:32] there and it was an adoption Ministry
[33:35] getting people to a placing well I
[33:37] spelled that wrong didn't I to a placing
[33:39] so now look now watch here's where I
[33:42] believe that brother brandham was
[33:44] positionally
[33:46] placed to the world if they believe what
[33:50] happened now this is where brother Brown
[33:52] went on the M on top of the
[33:54] mountain and what happened
[33:57] God placed a sword in his
[34:00] hand you hear I said
[34:02] placed okay he went to a place to be
[34:08] placed and I had my hands out and all at
[34:11] once something hit my hand now it wasn't
[34:13] just odd that a sword appeared in his
[34:19] hand what was what was not odd to me
[34:22] either but what was what was so specific
[34:25] he said it fit my my
[34:29] hand it fit my hand
[34:36] perfectly everybody with me just was his
[34:39] sword just dropped out of the sky and he
[34:41] picked it up like who's that guy with
[34:43] the Aaron King
[34:47] Arthur no this is the sword of the king
[34:51] not King
[34:52] Arthur did I go to sleep I don't know
[34:55] did I go into a trance I don't know was
[34:57] a Division I can't tell you only thing I
[35:00] can say is just the same thing like them
[35:02] Angels was and it struck my
[35:05] hand now watch it struck my hand and
[35:07] what struck his hand a sword and I
[35:10] looked it was a sword and it had pearl
[35:12] handles real pretty and had a guard over
[35:13] the gold it over with gold and the blade
[35:16] looked like something like Chrome like
[35:18] silver only it was real shiny it was so
[35:20] feathered sharp I thought oh my I
[35:23] thought isn't that the prettiest thing
[35:25] just fit my hand
[35:29] he didn't reach and grab it and say man
[35:32] this is
[35:33] uncomfortable no that was the sword of
[35:36] the king but what happened was it had
[35:38] already molded into brother Ram's hand
[35:41] because the sword that came out of his
[35:42] mouth was exactly the sword that came
[35:44] out of God's
[35:45] mouth it wasn't different it felt
[35:50] comfortable just fit my hand I thought
[35:52] that's awful pretty but I said hey I'm
[35:54] always afraid of them things a sword and
[35:56] I thought what will I do do with
[35:58] that and just then a voice shook down
[36:01] through there that rocked the rocks and
[36:02] said it's the sword of the king and then
[36:05] I came out of it the sword of the king
[36:08] now if it said a sword of a
[36:12] king see but it said the sword of the
[36:14] king and there's only one king and
[36:16] that's God and he has only one sword and
[36:19] that's his word what I live
[36:24] by not what I deny what I live
[36:28] by that so helped me God standing over
[36:30] his holy desk here with his holy word
[36:32] laying here it's the word amen now
[36:39] watch oh what a day we're living in what
[36:41] a great thing see the mystery and secret
[36:44] standing there when this left me in
[36:46] other words when he come out of the
[36:47] vision or whatever it was when it left
[36:48] him something just came to me and said
[36:51] Don't Fear now I didn't hear no voice
[36:53] like on the inside of me spoke I have to
[36:56] just tell you the truth just exact L
[36:57] what happened something hit and said
[36:59] Don't Fear this is that third pull what
[37:02] was it the opening of the word the
[37:04] mystery something that fit his hand
[37:05] perfect something that fit his in other
[37:07] words it fit his ministry
[37:11] perfect that's why God couldn't come to
[37:13] denomination he didn't take Billy Graham
[37:15] up on the mountain he didn't take o
[37:17] robbers up on the mountain Jack Schuler
[37:19] and all those different ones he took
[37:21] this man upon a mountain and then he was
[37:23] there and when he spoke this there was
[37:25] that authority of hear ye hear if you're
[37:27] going to get anything this is who you're
[37:30] going to get it from cuz brother
[37:31] brandham when he goes into the seals he
[37:34] corrects everything that he had an error
[37:36] about sorry don't throw tomatoes I'm
[37:39] just telling you there's one example
[37:41] right there he always thought that the
[37:42] saints were under the altar crying how
[37:44] long how long and it was not and we'll
[37:47] get into it when we talk about the seals
[37:49] first seal don't know what that was
[37:50] second seal don't know what that was
[37:51] made a horrible mistake mistake if I to
[37:54] U preached old notes U didn't know what
[37:56] the fourth was didn't know what the
[37:57] fifth was he had no idea what they were
[38:00] from one day to the
[38:02] next but oh when they opened up to him
[38:04] see when they opened up to you that
[38:06] gives you a confidence Revelation gives
[38:08] you a
[38:09] confidence when you got a revelation a
[38:11] one true and living God he gave you
[38:12] confidence that you didn't have to
[38:14] listen to a trinitarian
[38:16] idea and then when you had a revelation
[38:19] of water baptism nobody can talk you out
[38:21] of
[38:22] that I looked at our little Community
[38:24] Church the one June and I were married
[38:27] at
[38:28] um there it's not Pine Grove anymore but
[38:30] it's there in
[38:31] town and it said on the and on thing it
[38:34] says um something about something come
[38:38] together in
[38:39] baptism acts
[38:42] 2:41 they're not going to read acts 238
[38:45] I'll promise you
[38:47] that yeah acts
[38:49] 241 they read that sometimes I think
[38:52] it's acts
[38:53] 241 but they don't have an authority God
[38:56] can't use like I'm sorry he can't use
[38:58] people like I was with and they were
[39:01] devoid of the spirit of
[39:04] God flip-flops
[39:08] shorts look like had pajamas on it's
[39:11] just devoid of that any kind of
[39:14] spirituality of what God would have a
[39:17] set of
[39:19] deacons that would be able to say hey
[39:21] don't you go in there with that with
[39:23] that
[39:25] donut there was none of that they just
[39:27] walked right on
[39:29] in actually handed you a
[39:32] donut don't worry that will not happen
[39:35] here you can go get a donut
[39:38] anytime but what it is though there was
[39:41] no reverence and I mean when you're
[39:42] sitting there speaking to them and
[39:43] they're just you know you they're there
[39:44] but they're
[39:47] not I mean I tried I stayed in the
[39:49] scripture I didn't quote brother brandom
[39:51] I promise you I stayed right in the
[39:53] scriptures and they still just there's
[39:56] no reaction ction to it there's no
[39:59] fervor that hey there's something to
[40:03] that it was just like a meeting where
[40:05] you just come like a lodge like brother
[40:06] R said just a lodge somebody's going
[40:07] well I have a speaker today at the
[40:10] lodge but when the current is Flowing
[40:12] freely the word of God it expresses
[40:14] itself The Works that I do shall you do
[40:16] also and in the last days it shall come
[40:18] to pass behold I will send you Elijah
[40:20] the prophet and he shall turn the hearts
[40:21] of the children back to the faith of the
[40:23] fathers and in there there would be a
[40:26] Time come forth when he could Express
[40:28] himself in the fullness of his godhead
[40:30] deity now listen we know brother Brandon
[40:32] was the first partaker of this
[40:35] right all right there had to be a first
[40:38] partaker and then the first partaker
[40:40] didn't keep it to himself he gave it out
[40:42] to the five-fold ministry and then the
[40:44] five-fold ministry takes it to the
[40:45] people is everybody with me Jesus is the
[40:47] one that that multiplied the fishes that
[40:49] loaves but he handed it to the disciples
[40:52] and the disciples handed it to the
[40:53] people telling you that there's a
[40:55] Ministry that comes that you've got a
[40:57] headship then you've got somebody that's
[41:00] that that captures that headship and
[41:03] that Revelation and then breaks it out
[41:04] to the
[41:05] people all right and then there would be
[41:08] time come when he would Express himself
[41:10] in fullness of his godhead deity through
[41:13] his
[41:14] church have the preeminence in this
[41:17] church oh my what the anointed man now
[41:20] the anointed people to bring back the
[41:23] anointed bride what are we anointed for
[41:25] adoption we're anointed to a Time time
[41:27] that
[41:28] when God's name's not going to be in
[41:30] that checkbook your name's going to be
[41:32] on the checkbook but you're not going to
[41:34] write it and not know what you're
[41:37] doing the confidence every time brother
[41:39] randam met God every time he met these
[41:42] um the the angels and every time he met
[41:45] the finger Mountain where he had the
[41:47] marriage and divorce and where he met on
[41:48] this mountain where God put the sword in
[41:50] his hand what was that doing that wasn't
[41:52] building my confidence that was building
[41:55] his confidence and when I see his
[41:57] confidence I'm
[42:00] confident that's where a great leader
[42:02] out on the battlefield he's just he he's
[42:03] got to get the confidence of the people
[42:05] but he's got to he can't be one that's
[42:07] just hiding behind the bush saying all
[42:08] right y'all go no he's got to be the one
[42:11] that grabs a sword and takes off
[42:14] first he leads a group of people so
[42:16] brother R took the sword
[42:18] first and it fit his hand perfect so
[42:20] what he preached with a perfect
[42:23] message to accept what Eve turned down
[42:27] and Adam coming back with the anointing
[42:29] of the word because he said my word is
[42:35] spirit
[42:37] now I put this in here because it
[42:40] fits but I never read this quote before
[42:42] and I was scrolling through you know a
[42:45] lot of people are are honing in on
[42:47] brother Ram's
[42:49] mistakes believe the
[42:51] sign blah whatever all right they honing
[42:55] in on on his mistakes the mistakes he
[42:57] made the things he did things he said
[42:59] that wasn't right maybe they say I'm
[43:00] saying they said all right let me read
[43:03] you this 1960 as I was with
[43:07] Moses and to Joshua the new commander of
[43:09] the army after Moses had passed on cuz
[43:12] now remember we're going to have a we
[43:14] have a Joshua
[43:15] commission we don't have a Moses
[43:18] commission Moses had a commission to
[43:20] take him to the promised land but
[43:22] remember he messed up all right so God
[43:25] said you're not going to the promised
[43:26] land but I'm not going to keep these
[43:28] people in the wilderness they're going
[43:29] to the promised land somebody's going to
[43:31] take them so he said Joshua as I was
[43:33] with Moses I'll be with
[43:35] you so there was a Joshua commission you
[43:38] and I are under that Joshua Commission
[43:39] Now is what not just take them in but
[43:42] put them where they're supposed to
[43:46] be there's a Ministry that tells us
[43:48] where it'll help you find out where your
[43:51] position
[43:53] is now watch and to Joshua the new
[43:57] commander of the army after Moses had
[43:59] passed on seeing that God stayed with
[44:01] him in his
[44:05] mistakes he held his commission up no
[44:09] matter what Moses done it was Moses
[44:13] office that God
[44:15] respected praise the
[44:18] Lord he was a prophet he was above all
[44:21] the prophets he was really more than any
[44:24] Prophet they
[44:25] had when his own sister laughed at him
[44:28] for marry an Ethiopian girl he called
[44:30] him together and said don't you fear God
[44:33] there be one of you who spiritual or
[44:34] Prophet I will speak to him in Visions
[44:36] make myself known to him in
[44:38] dreams but it's not so with Moses I
[44:40] speak lip to ear with him don't you fear
[44:43] God you remember
[44:45] Mariam kind of condemned her brother for
[44:48] doing what he did and what did God do
[44:50] god struckle with Leprosy everybody with
[44:53] me now what happened to Sister Ma
[44:57] remember she slammed the door on brother
[44:59] Bram and said he was the brother Bram
[45:00] saidwell he's here he he he didn't like
[45:02] what you just did remember she had the
[45:05] tumor right almost died from it but then
[45:07] the third pull comes into effect and
[45:09] heals her of the of the tumor but I mean
[45:11] she struck against a prophet you listen
[45:13] these people that strike against the
[45:15] prophet I just think we need to get away
[45:18] from
[45:22] them I don't want to be
[45:24] here when the fire falls on the them cuz
[45:28] remember listen you're not turning him
[45:30] down you're turning God
[45:32] down if that's the man of the hour
[45:34] you're turning God
[45:36] down now watch see that's not a good
[45:39] thing to upon God's people you Hur
[45:42] him when you do so God had commissioned
[45:45] Moses his failures meant
[45:51] nothing God knowed his
[45:54] heart and he one time Moses complained
[45:56] about without having too much to do so
[45:58] God took his spirit and divided it among
[46:00] 70 they had no more Spirit than they had
[46:02] at the beginning but only thing they
[46:04] just had more
[46:06] Machinery that's what we got today more
[46:09] Machinery same amount of spirit God can
[46:13] put his entire Spirit Upon A man watch
[46:16] if he wants to or he can scatter it
[46:20] amongst thousands if he wants to one day
[46:24] he put his whole Spirit Upon A Man
[46:25] Called Jesus now he's scattered it
[46:27] through his church everywhere God keeps
[46:31] his
[46:32] commission so forget about the fs and
[46:36] failures brother B knew he had a message
[46:40] he brought that message and so help me
[46:42] God don't turn it
[46:46] down this is not play pretty they can
[46:48] play all they want to out there this is
[46:51] not
[46:52] playtime the third poll is also two the
[46:54] totally lost that will turn this message
[46:57] down be preached to brother Brown said
[46:59] they'll think they're still getting
[47:01] saved they're still getting healed and
[47:03] they still going to church and a door be
[47:08] shut now look notice the very day when
[47:11] this messenger not when he starts on
[47:14] we've read this many times so brother
[47:16] bradam from 47 to 63 we understand that
[47:20] he was working under the first pull and
[47:22] the second pull is everybody with me all
[47:24] right right but when he begins to to
[47:27] declare his message his message was not
[47:29] the first pull his message was not the
[47:32] second pull that's why the angel kept
[47:33] saying quit trying to explain it move on
[47:38] he wanted he wanted him to move on
[47:40] through that and come up to the place to
[47:42] where he come to the third pull or the
[47:44] opening of the word the first pull was
[47:47] healing second pull prophesying third
[47:50] pull the opening of the word the
[47:51] Mysteries reveal now that was the third
[47:53] poll no more there's hire order to
[47:56] reveal F the word than a prophet but the
[47:59] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[48:01] is by the word and I don't you know they
[48:04] can search whoever they want to show me
[48:07] somebody that's more Vindicated than
[48:08] brother
[48:09] bradam scripture and by vision and by
[48:12] prophecy and by anything you want to
[48:14] talk about now I ain't talk about his
[48:16] mistakes like I said right there God
[48:18] didn't look at Moses's mistakes Moses
[48:19] was a
[48:23] murderer
[48:25] murder that David
[48:28] murder had his best friend
[48:31] killed just so he could get his wife
[48:33] that he had already been with so he
[48:34] commit adultery but remember God saw
[48:37] something in
[48:38] David he saw his heart and knew if that
[48:42] if David had the new birth he wouldn't
[48:44] have done that but it wasn't time for it
[48:46] he was stuck under or in the order of
[48:48] bulls and goats which covered it didn't
[48:50] take care of it but remember David's
[48:53] going to be there Samson's going to be
[48:55] there all those ones that had those
[48:57] flaws they're all going to be there but
[49:00] they're not
[49:02] bride but the only way the proper can be
[49:04] Vindicated by the word and remember the
[49:05] third pull was the opening of The Seven
[49:08] Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's
[49:11] been sealed in the word so now look we
[49:15] see that brother brandham started
[49:18] out the scripture there and I think it's
[49:20] in Timothy or somewhere where it says
[49:22] the the angel says do the work of an
[49:24] evangelist everybody with me on that
[49:27] all right now look what did he put in
[49:29] the Cornerstone of the
[49:32] Tabernacle he put what that angel said
[49:35] do the work of an evangelist make proof
[49:37] of your ministry and all these things
[49:39] that was the
[49:40] Cornerstone kind
[49:42] of odd that it was put in the
[49:46] Cornerstone not on
[49:48] top because when he when he started
[49:51] preaching he had to do as we're going to
[49:52] read here in a minute zerubabel wiped
[49:55] off the foundation and built the
[49:58] house restore brother Brown's message to
[50:00] was to restore us
[50:02] back so the Cornerstone of the
[50:06] Tabernacle is do was to do the work of
[50:08] an evangelist now taking sides with
[50:10] Jesus brother randam I don't know how
[50:12] that come black like that but must be
[50:14] important as I have done the work of now
[50:17] as I have done the work of an evangelist
[50:19] and here is my plea if that is pleasing
[50:21] to God and I've done the work all right
[50:24] trusting that I have pleased him what
[50:27] pleased
[50:30] him this is my son and whom I'm pleased
[50:34] to dwell pleased to dwell and then hear
[50:38] you him trusting that I pleased him
[50:41] asking forgiveness for all my mistakes
[50:43] then he may be calling me from the field
[50:45] of evangelism to be his
[50:48] Prophet I cannot be an evangelist if I'm
[50:50] to be an evangelist I cannot be a
[50:52] prophet I'm mixing the two offices
[50:55] that's where I've always fussed about
[50:57] standing on the platform it's never been
[50:59] good or successful I read this last week
[51:02] it's never what it's never been good or
[51:05] successful millions of people got healed
[51:08] on that platform thousands of people
[51:11] hundred thousands people received the
[51:13] new birth under his ministry and he said
[51:16] right here it's never been good
[51:18] successful God has used it but it NE I
[51:21] but I've never thought it was his direct
[51:24] will it's been his per Ive will stand on
[51:28] the platform a vision or two will knock
[51:30] you out almost see that's another thing
[51:33] when he was in the first and second pull
[51:34] he would only get to what eight or 10
[51:36] people and then they like you saw in
[51:38] that in the p in the show the picture
[51:40] part of him he'd get so weak they'd have
[51:42] to pick him up that didn't happen in' 63
[51:44] 64 and
[51:45] 65 he come to a place of authority where
[51:48] God even had he had authority over his
[51:51] body brother R didn't and God
[51:54] did cuz it was all knock you out almost
[51:57] see then if you tell this person how to
[51:59] straighten himself up and what to do and
[52:01] then the next person stand there he's
[52:02] expecting the same thing and you can't
[52:05] tell him unless something tells you to
[52:07] tell him and then the other people feel
[52:09] like you're a traitor or a backslider
[52:10] think about that sometimes we don't
[52:13] think about that cuz some people be set
[52:14] in the audience they'll have the same
[52:16] identical thing that this person's got
[52:18] this person will receive the healing
[52:19] he'll call them out and that person's
[52:20] not well don't you think there's
[52:22] something something start messing with
[52:24] your mindset well what's you know what's
[52:26] wrong with with me why didn't he call me
[52:27] out all those things like that I'm just
[52:30] glad I didn't have that or a demon or
[52:32] something because you don't tell them
[52:34] what they want to
[52:36] know that's not the office the way a
[52:39] prophet operates so now he did a work of
[52:42] an evangelist but remember he was a
[52:44] prophet but he had to do the work of an
[52:46] evangelist to get the building built
[52:49] according to the Bible we'll read here
[52:51] in just a minute the Chief
[52:54] Cornerstone cornered down here at the
[52:56] bottom Cornerstone to something to build
[52:59] on not cap off
[53:02] with cornerstones at the bottom starts
[53:05] out real real low to the ground Psalms
[53:09] 18:22 the stone which the builders
[53:12] refused has become The Headstone of the
[53:16] corner the stone which the builders in
[53:19] other words the Revelation which the
[53:21] builders refused who did they refuse The
[53:24] Headstone Jesus Christ but that didn't
[53:26] tear the Lord Jesus he said I'll come
[53:28] back on the day of Pentecost and I'm
[53:30] going to start building my church and
[53:32] I'm going to build it on the cornerstone
[53:34] what the apostles and Prophets Jesus
[53:37] Christ being the Chief
[53:40] Cornerstone so brother R started the
[53:42] same way a Cornerstone message come back
[53:45] to God get the new birth live right
[53:48] conductor Doctrine do the things of God
[53:51] all those things but that really wasn't
[53:52] his message but it had to prepare people
[53:55] it had to prepare us even us coming
[53:57] through this it had to prepare us for
[53:59] for an
[54:00] event that's right real
[54:04] approaching we can't keep putting it off
[54:06] and say
[54:08] well let's wait till something happens
[54:11] well I'm not waiting until something
[54:13] happens listen we are fulfilling
[54:15] prophecy we're as we were talking the
[54:17] other day um where um brother bisc put
[54:22] on that green shirt and he testified
[54:24] that he was an hour and a half in that
[54:26] Vision before he realized it was the
[54:28] vision hour and a half into the vision
[54:32] he thought his wife had throw tot
[54:35] away she sewed it back up and put it in
[54:38] his pack he says oh I got this shirt and
[54:40] he puts it on hour and a half later he
[54:42] something tells him say look at your
[54:45] shirt could we be the same way could we
[54:48] be already in the Vision hours days
[54:50] weeks
[54:51] months and then just realize cuz
[54:55] Hallelujah it didn't stopped the
[54:57] vision that he didn't know it for an
[54:59] hour and a half that didn't stop what
[55:01] was going
[55:02] on it happened exactly the way brother R
[55:05] said a man with a little hand had on a
[55:06] green Checker
[55:07] shirt same way with the Bible this Bible
[55:11] is to one group of people and that's his
[55:18] bride it's all right so if he's the head
[55:22] Cornerstone he's the Cornerstone but
[55:24] he's going to be the headstone he is the
[55:25] headstone Stone to the church everybody
[55:27] with me that's why the church turns him
[55:30] down as brother Aaron was preaching and
[55:32] I did speak on just a minute over there
[55:34] uh to the Methodist brothers and sisters
[55:36] that a lot of PE boy they had some
[55:37] raised eyebrows too
[55:39] Aaron I said a lot of people want to be
[55:41] saved but you don't want him to be your
[55:44] Lord that's the same way with this
[55:46] everybody wants to have the
[55:49] Cornerstone but they don't want the
[55:51] headstone cuz the headstone is the one
[55:54] with the power the head Stone's the one
[55:56] that's the head of you and that means
[55:59] he's your
[56:01] Lord everybody with me so Stone means
[56:04] Revelation so kids everybody listen when
[56:06] I say Cornerstone headstone I mean a
[56:08] corner Revelation something to build on
[56:11] a head Revelation is Jesus
[56:14] Christ all right devil ain't got nothing
[56:17] to do with
[56:18] this he build his own kingdom and he can
[56:21] try to destroy yours but God's going to
[56:23] have a group of people that he's going
[56:26] to sit down on and cap them off and
[56:29] become their
[56:31] head I just believe it
[56:35] 100% Matthew
[56:37] 21:42 Jesus said unto
[56:39] them this is the scripture he's
[56:41] referring to did you never read in the
[56:43] scripture the stone which the builders
[56:45] rejected now the stone the Revelation
[56:48] that the builders supposedly the
[56:50] Pharisees and Sadducees and the
[56:51] religious people today they were
[56:53] supposed to be the builders
[56:56] but they rejected him but that didn't
[56:59] deter him he just come right back on the
[57:00] day of Pentecost as a little bitty Stone
[57:02] a Cornerstone to build
[57:05] on the same has become the head of the
[57:07] corner this is the Lord's doing and it's
[57:10] marvelous in our eyes therefore say I
[57:13] unto you the kingdom of God shall be
[57:15] taken from
[57:18] you and given to a nation bringing
[57:22] forth love joy peace longsuffering Faith
[57:27] virtue knowledge Temperance ain't that
[57:30] the
[57:31] fruits and who's this
[57:33] nation us the Gentiles he's taking it
[57:37] from the Jews they've rejected him they
[57:39] rejected The Headstone taking it from
[57:41] them and starts building his church on
[57:43] the day of Pentecost with a Cornerstone
[57:45] message looking to the
[57:48] Head they never deny Jesus was not God
[57:51] or or or anything like that they just
[57:53] didn't listen sure they knew who he was
[57:55] but they didn't know everything about
[57:57] him like you and I
[57:58] do I'm
[58:01] sorry they just
[58:03] didn't and whosoever shall fall on this
[58:05] on this Stone shall be broken but on
[58:08] whom so it shall fall it will grind him
[58:10] to powder so it's okay it's it's best
[58:12] for us to fall on this Revelation and be
[58:16] broken than to have God give you
[58:19] judgment from the top fall and grind you
[58:23] to
[58:23] powder cuz that's what's going to happen
[58:25] in the tribulation that we're going to
[58:26] walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[58:28] people that turn down Jesus Christ if
[58:31] they turn you down they're turning down
[58:34] Jesus Christ if he's inside of you
[58:37] Ephesians
[58:38] 2:20 and are built upon the foundation
[58:40] of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus
[58:42] Christ himself being the
[58:44] chief Corner
[58:48] Revelation everybody with me in whom all
[58:52] the building now building fitly from
[58:56] name together
[58:58] groweth growth unto an Holy Temple in
[59:02] the Lord and whom you also are build it
[59:04] together for a habitation of God through
[59:07] the
[59:08] spirit you and I Isaiah 28 verse 16
[59:12] therefore thus sayith the Lord God
[59:14] behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a
[59:17] stone a tried Stone a revelation a
[59:20] precious Revelation a sure Foundation he
[59:24] that believeth shall not make haste
[59:28] listen now remember zerubabel somebody
[59:31] was preaching on this not too long ago
[59:33] zerubabel means sown in
[59:36] Babylon brother randam was born in
[59:38] Babylon okay because he's our zerubabel
[59:41] of the day everybody with me Zechariah
[59:44] 4:6 then he answered and spake unto me
[59:46] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[59:48] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[59:51] power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of
[59:54] hosts who art thou oh great great
[59:56] Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt
[59:59] become a plain and he shall bring forth
[1:00:01] The
[1:00:02] Headstone okay he's going to bring forth
[1:00:05] The Headstone so whoever this zerubabel
[1:00:07] is he's going to come out of the world
[1:00:09] out of Babylon and he's going to build
[1:00:12] this church build this building and
[1:00:16] bring the headstone to sit on top of
[1:00:19] it therefore with shoutings try that
[1:00:23] sometime crying Grace Grace unto it
[1:00:26] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[1:00:28] me saying the hands of now watch the
[1:00:31] hands of zerubabel have laid the
[1:00:33] foundation of this
[1:00:36] house his hand shall also finish
[1:00:41] it what is his hand it's the working
[1:00:44] part who's the working part it's me and
[1:00:50] you and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[1:00:52] hosts has sent me
[1:00:56] to you behold I send
[1:00:59] you for who ha despised the day of small
[1:01:02] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[1:01:04] see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel
[1:01:07] now watch with these
[1:01:11] seven that would make him number eight
[1:01:14] now there's no eight Messengers but
[1:01:16] remember there's eight manifestations of
[1:01:18] God in the end time there's one more
[1:01:21] which takes us to The Eternity takes us
[1:01:23] into a Rapture all right is everybody
[1:01:25] with me
[1:01:26] those of you who been here a long time
[1:01:28] you heard brother Dale preach it for
[1:01:29] years they are the eyes of the Lord
[1:01:31] which run to and fro through the whole
[1:01:38] earth I was looking through the
[1:01:41] scripture just thinking about things and
[1:01:43] I was thinking about the the movie there
[1:01:45] the The Chosen the woman that washed
[1:01:48] Jesus's feet the Bible says it was Mary
[1:01:50] Magdalene but um that wasn't who washed
[1:01:53] his feet so they were a little bit off
[1:01:55] on that
[1:01:56] but Watch What Happens here's Jesus
[1:01:59] here's the
[1:02:02] headstone everybody with me here's the
[1:02:05] headstone this is the
[1:02:07] man he walks into a Pharisees
[1:02:12] house
[1:02:14] Simon and remember brother R preached
[1:02:17] many times Jesus with dirty
[1:02:19] feet but I want you to watch the
[1:02:21] allegory here in this in this
[1:02:24] scene but because when you walk into a
[1:02:27] man's house in this time of of um of um
[1:02:32] I said scripture but this time of when
[1:02:33] Jesus was there or during this there was
[1:02:36] a custom that they would put oil on your
[1:02:40] head when you walked in they'd give you
[1:02:42] oil put it on your head they make you
[1:02:44] feel cool and then they'd wash your
[1:02:49] feet remember they did not do that to
[1:02:52] Jesus so they rejected
[1:02:56] the
[1:02:57] head watch what he says
[1:03:01] though seest thou this woman he turned
[1:03:03] to the woman and said unto Simon seest
[1:03:06] thou this woman woman is
[1:03:09] who Church
[1:03:12] bride seest thou this woman I entered
[1:03:15] into thine house th gavest me no water
[1:03:18] for my feet now what is feet
[1:03:22] Cornerstone the bottom right here
[1:03:26] she didn't go to his head she went to
[1:03:28] his feet it wasn't time to go to the
[1:03:30] head cuz listen this woman is going to
[1:03:34] be the head this woman is going to be
[1:03:36] the one that anoints Jesus's head cuz
[1:03:38] we're going to be the anointing that
[1:03:40] anoints that
[1:03:41] head but she has washed my feet with
[1:03:44] tears and wiped them with the hairs of
[1:03:46] her head thou gavest me no kiss but this
[1:03:50] woman since the time I came in hath not
[1:03:52] ceased to kiss my feet
[1:03:56] kissed my
[1:04:00] feet my head with oil thou dest
[1:04:05] anoint he was telling them right then
[1:04:08] that they're going to reject his
[1:04:11] headship because they didn't do it Simon
[1:04:13] said no in other
[1:04:14] words he didn't want
[1:04:17] to because remember the scripture says
[1:04:19] he's going to be rejected The Headstone
[1:04:20] was rejected my head with oil thou didst
[1:04:23] not anoint but this woman hath anointed
[1:04:25] my feet with ointment wherefore I say
[1:04:28] unto thee her sins which are many are
[1:04:32] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[1:04:34] little Is Forgiven the same loveth
[1:04:37] little and he said unto
[1:04:39] her
[1:04:41] me Church
[1:04:44] bride because of what you did your sins
[1:04:47] are forgiven you oh praise the
[1:04:52] Lord let's read this right here and then
[1:04:54] we'll close cuz now we're going to come
[1:04:56] into a Joshua commission and watch how
[1:04:58] this works Joshua 1
[1:05:01] vers1 and after the death of Moses the
[1:05:03] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[1:05:05] the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of
[1:05:07] nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my
[1:05:10] servant is dead pretty plain he didn't
[1:05:13] say he's gone away didn't say he's
[1:05:14] coming back he's
[1:05:16] dead now therefore arise go over this
[1:05:20] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[1:05:23] land which I do give to them even to the
[1:05:26] children of Israel now what land is he
[1:05:28] talking about he's talking about the
[1:05:29] inheritance of property that they were
[1:05:32] told they were going to have Abraham
[1:05:34] wherever your soul or your feet goes
[1:05:36] that's going to be the possession that's
[1:05:38] going to be where my people are going to
[1:05:40] live but right now they're out in this
[1:05:42] desert there's a couple of million of
[1:05:44] them and they don't know where they're
[1:05:46] going they know the promised land's
[1:05:48] right
[1:05:49] here but I don't want to be in ephraim's
[1:05:52] place Ephraim don't want be in manasa's
[1:05:54] place they were guaranteed
[1:05:56] they were going to be put where they are
[1:05:58] the most
[1:06:00] fruitful come on somebody the most
[1:06:03] fruitful you can work the best you know
[1:06:06] what to do in your area remember brother
[1:06:08] Brown said he didn't want Manasses
[1:06:10] didn't want corn in this one's field and
[1:06:11] this one didn't want this and in this
[1:06:13] one field that's why brother Brown said
[1:06:15] when the bride realizes who she is what
[1:06:17] she's doing here what's her position
[1:06:18] what's her
[1:06:21] place we'll be an invincible Army
[1:06:23] because we won't be fighting against
[1:06:24] each other we'll be figh with each
[1:06:26] other Moses my servant is dead now
[1:06:30] therefore arise and go over this Jordan
[1:06:32] thou and all this people into the land
[1:06:34] which I do give to them even to the
[1:06:37] children of Israel every place that's a
[1:06:39] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[1:06:42] have I given now he didn't say I'm going
[1:06:45] to he said I have given I've given it to
[1:06:49] you but what about he didn't say what
[1:06:53] about Lord what about this journey I got
[1:06:56] to go through what about this Wilderness
[1:06:57] I'm in don't worry I'll give you a land
[1:07:01] you have a promised land that I'm taking
[1:07:02] you to if you'll just let me get you
[1:07:07] there every place that the soul your
[1:07:09] foot from the Wilderness and this
[1:07:11] Lebanon even to the Great River the
[1:07:13] river Euphrates now that's over this way
[1:07:15] and all the land of the Hittites into
[1:07:17] the great sea which is the
[1:07:20] Mediterranean all right toward the going
[1:07:22] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[1:07:24] that's on the west
[1:07:26] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:07:28] before thee all the days of thy life as
[1:07:31] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[1:07:33] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[1:07:37] strong and of a good courage For unto
[1:07:40] this people shalt thou divide for an
[1:07:42] inheritance the land what was the Joshua
[1:07:45] commission get them in the land get them
[1:07:47] placed all
[1:07:49] right he didn't say you didn't have to
[1:07:51] fight for
[1:07:53] it because you got to possess the gates
[1:07:55] of the
[1:07:57] enemy and I swear unto their fathers to
[1:07:59] give them only be thou strong and very
[1:08:01] good C two times he said this only be
[1:08:04] thou strong and very courageous that
[1:08:06] thou mayest observe to do according to
[1:08:08] all the
[1:08:09] law all the 1100
[1:08:13] sermons that Moses brought
[1:08:15] us everybody with me that all
[1:08:20] right cuz of Moses commission was what
[1:08:23] to get them
[1:08:24] out but not to take them
[1:08:26] in that was Joshua's
[1:08:30] Commission Now Moses my servant
[1:08:32] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[1:08:34] right hand don't go after this Doctrine
[1:08:37] don't go after this Doctrine you stay
[1:08:39] with the books and the
[1:08:41] tapes that thou mayest Prosper
[1:08:44] wheresoever thou goest this book of the
[1:08:47] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[1:08:48] but Thou shalt meditate there in day and
[1:08:50] night read your Bible study but thou
[1:08:53] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:08:55] that is written therein for then Thou
[1:08:57] shalt make thy way
[1:09:00] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[1:09:05] success have not I commanded thee be
[1:09:08] strong of good courage that's the third
[1:09:09] time he told him that be Not Afraid
[1:09:12] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:09:15] thy God is with thee whether soever and
[1:09:18] listen folks look at me just for a
[1:09:19] second that was a man that didn't have
[1:09:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in his
[1:09:24] soul
[1:09:27] that's a man that was under the blood of
[1:09:28] bulls and goats and did the
[1:09:31] law
[1:09:33] wow what a great
[1:09:36] position we're going to read this and
[1:09:38] then we'll then we'll U musicians come
[1:09:41] on a seed shall pess possess the Gate of
[1:09:44] his enemy now watch when they came out
[1:09:47] of the Wilderness to go into Jordan when
[1:09:50] God spoke to the famous
[1:09:54] Joshua and told Joshua to cross over to
[1:09:57] make the people
[1:10:00] ready it was in the month of
[1:10:03] April a month of
[1:10:06] floods it wasn't a flowery bed of ease
[1:10:09] the Jordan wasn't about this deep
[1:10:11] flowing real soft no it was a Roaring
[1:10:14] River all the um snow had melted from
[1:10:18] the mountains in Juda and it was
[1:10:22] overflowing sometimes we look at a river
[1:10:25] of of our life and we say man this is
[1:10:26] the worst time in the world for me to
[1:10:28] even try to get
[1:10:29] over well pray for
[1:10:32] me it was a month of April a month of
[1:10:37] floods looked like it was a poor
[1:10:39] strategy of God to bring them to that
[1:10:41] place to that old muddy Jordan the worst
[1:10:45] time in the world when the river is at
[1:10:47] its highest usually God lets you get to
[1:10:51] the last End of the Road the last mile
[1:10:54] of the way
[1:10:56] then he steps
[1:10:57] in if you're a Seed of Abraham believe
[1:11:00] God and hold his promise for healing for
[1:11:03] salvation for the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost whatever it is whatever the enemy
[1:11:07] is God lets you get something sometime
[1:11:11] right to the end of the
[1:11:15] road happened to me happened to you it's
[1:11:17] happened to all of
[1:11:18] us and it looks worse than it ever did
[1:11:22] the doctor said there's not a chance but
[1:11:24] you're the the Seed of Abraham with a
[1:11:26] promise that you shall possess the Gate
[1:11:29] of every
[1:11:33] enemy now watch this Joshua commission
[1:11:36] Joshua didn't stand there and try to
[1:11:38] figure out how to get across the
[1:11:42] river God told him get the ark get the
[1:11:45] priest put them in front soon as they
[1:11:47] touch the water the waters are going to
[1:11:49] part but now look have your people go
[1:11:51] several hundred yards behind because
[1:11:52] they never been that way before let the
[1:11:54] preachers go first first let the
[1:11:56] preachers get the
[1:11:57] message then tell you how to walk
[1:12:01] across Joshua didn't think how wide
[1:12:04] Jordan was or how muddy it was he said
[1:12:07] Gather yourself together sanctify
[1:12:09] yourself and take the Ark of God and go
[1:12:11] forward and he possessed the Gate of the
[1:12:14] enemy why because he was taking a
[1:12:16] promised
[1:12:18] people to a Promised
[1:12:21] Land by a promise of God and was the
[1:12:25] children of Abraham how many of you are
[1:12:28] children of Abraham if you're not get
[1:12:32] in cuz remember we all got to Cross
[1:12:35] Jordan
[1:12:41] sometime we'll stop right there come and
[1:12:43] stand we'll finish
[1:12:48] Sunday don't look at
[1:12:51] circumstances I know sometimes we We
[1:12:54] Fall Down and we think how in the world
[1:12:56] can we do that anymore I've tried this
[1:12:58] way and this way and this way well maybe
[1:13:00] you going to need to quit
[1:13:01] trying maybe you need to let God do it
[1:13:04] for you we get oursel we get ourselves
[1:13:07] in the way a lot of
[1:13:09] times but if we're under that Joshua
[1:13:11] commission somebody which now Joshua
[1:13:15] remember was a time is the Holy Ghost
[1:13:16] right right everybody with me that's not
[1:13:18] Joshua is not one man that's going to
[1:13:20] lead us through brother random came and
[1:13:23] led us up to the promised land everybody
[1:13:25] right with me he even showed us into the
[1:13:28] promised land because he had a vision of
[1:13:30] the future
[1:13:32] home he had a vision of the
[1:13:35] Millennium he had a vision of the
[1:13:37] Rapture and a vision of the Resurrection
[1:13:40] he showed us and told us what was going
[1:13:42] to happen but he couldn't go cuz it it
[1:13:45] wasn't his commission there's not a
[1:13:47] Joshua one person a man named Joshua or
[1:13:49] one man going to lead us out of here
[1:13:51] it's going to be a collective body of
[1:13:53] people with a Joshua commission to get
[1:13:57] us placed where we're supposed to be and
[1:13:59] listen when you get into that place you
[1:14:02] got to be able to use
[1:14:06] it you got to know where you're at
[1:14:09] folks if you floundering
[1:14:13] around come for prayer get a prayer clo
[1:14:16] cry out to God find out your position
[1:14:19] cuz I'm telling you the devil is going
[1:14:22] to give you one if you don't find one
[1:14:24] from God
[1:14:26] the devil's going to give you something
[1:14:27] that'll satisfy your outside person
[1:14:30] that'll give you a feeling that'll give
[1:14:32] you an
[1:14:33] emotion but those people when they got
[1:14:35] placed in the promised land the problem
[1:14:38] with them is is they didn't kill
[1:14:40] everybody that they were supposed to
[1:14:41] kill they left a few of this one to
[1:14:44] certain place they left some of the
[1:14:45] Hittites they left some of these people
[1:14:47] you and I are not supposed to leave one
[1:14:50] person because remember what happened to
[1:14:52] Saul
[1:14:55] the prophet Samuel told him you go down
[1:15:00] there you kill
[1:15:02] everything don't leave
[1:15:05] nothing Samuel walks in and they're
[1:15:07] sitting there having a party and there
[1:15:09] set two kings over there in the corner
[1:15:11] in a jail and Samuel
[1:15:14] says I hear the Lo of sheep I hear a
[1:15:18] sound that I shouldn't be listening to
[1:15:19] and and what are these two men doing
[1:15:21] here what did that Prophet do he
[1:15:25] executed those two
[1:15:27] kings throw the sword at Saul and said
[1:15:30] you're out of here buddy you're not even
[1:15:33] worth you not you didn't do what I told
[1:15:35] you to do to obey is better than

[1:21:25] placing they had to fight for every inch
[1:21:28] of ground they had there was no way they
[1:21:31] were going to take it just by a flowery
[1:21:33] bed of e it might have been a place
[1:21:35] flowing with milk and honey but it also
[1:21:38] had enemies in it the enemy had come in
[1:21:40] and took the land
[1:21:42] over but God promised the Israelites not
[1:21:46] those

[1:21:56] not going to adopt the devil's kids he's

[1:23:27] do with what he
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:29] said you think well maybe my Jordan is
[1:23:32] bigger than your Jordan the Jordan was
[1:23:34] overflowing it didn't matter if it was
[1:23:36] that much or or the whole valley they
[1:23:38] had to get across but did they get
[1:23:40] across by shovels and did they get
[1:23:42] across by boats and man-made
[1:23:45] ideas no they got across because God
[1:23:48] told them what to do and they got across
[1:23:51] that way when that priest foot hit that
[1:23:54] water
[1:23:55] it didn't just clear it back brother
[1:23:56] Lise it did just like he did he said as
[1:23:59] I was with Moses I'll be with you
[1:24:02] brother Alex he didn't just they didn't
[1:24:04] trudge across on mud no when they come
[1:24:08] out of Egypt that big old River I mean
[1:24:11] that big old Lake the Red Sea it parted
[1:24:15] and God blew a wind all night and what
[1:24:17] it done was it made that clay just as
[1:24:19] hard as a rock so all the camels and all
[1:24:21] the horses and all the Chariots could
[1:24:23] get across
[1:24:25] on dry land same way with Joshua they
[1:24:28] went across on dry land because he said
[1:24:31] as I was with Moses I'll be with you as
[1:24:34] he was with all people as he was with
[1:24:36] brother randam he'll be with us you just
[1:24:39] got to believe that now the office of a
[1:24:41] prophet is over here don't worry about
[1:24:43] that we're not all prophets okay but we
[1:24:46] are prophetic people that can understand
[1:24:48] a prophet that's my whole thing we got
[1:24:50] to understand the
[1:24:52] prophet because he's got the mind of God
[1:24:55] so what are we doing we're actually
[1:24:56] getting the mind of God through that
[1:24:58] vessel and I pray that we'll receive
[1:25:00] that as we continue through this adopt
[1:25:02] series of adoption that we'll see who we
[1:25:04] are see what we got open the book look
[1:25:07] at the will and see what God's give us

[1:25:11] heads dear heavenly father thank you for

[1:25:30] to come to the place to we realize who

[1:25:36] the world falling apart we see
