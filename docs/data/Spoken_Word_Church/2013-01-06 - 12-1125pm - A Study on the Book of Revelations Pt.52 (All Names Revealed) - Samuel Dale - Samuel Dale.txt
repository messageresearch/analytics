thank you in Jesus name amen everybody ought to know these scriptures by Heart by now but remember what I announced if possible I'm going to this coming Sunday morning you know uh that be the second I want to just preach a entire message on Redemption like in one message from the beginning the fall all the way through of the Redemptive plan of God and I hope that you will uh listen to it and enjoy it may say some things that we haven't said before but we'll try to to make it as scriptural as we can and then to show you what we believe and what we're looking forward to and then we will for the afternoon have questions and answers so just you know put that into your to your thinking says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy keep those things which are written there in for the time is at hand the time to understand remember now it saying the words of this prophecy until something is made manifest it is a prophecy right right that's right it's a prophecy Until It's Made manifest it was a prophecy that a child would be born see that was a prophecy speaking of it proclaiming it declaring it but one day a child was born and there was no prophecy anymore it was the truth okay we're speaking of a prophecy here of this six seal but one day it will be real amen right amen 12th verse 6th chapter and I beheld when he had open the six seal and low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sa Claus of high and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and when the Heaven and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together together and every mountain and every island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every bondman and every Freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word then we want to read the as we did this morning Matthew the 24th chapter and reading verse 29 and 30 immediately after the tri of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall be shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory all right now the reason I'm reading that one in relation on this mourning and dis afternoon is because of the the three questions that was asked the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24 you know what will be the time that there won't be one stone left on another we know that was Titus in ad70 and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world so the sick seal ends the world all right but the sign of his coming is the sign of the son of man right which means that the seals has opened right cuz the seals is dealing with the son of man right the son of man the the word made flesh amen the prophet entered his ministry he was in the ministry of restoration up until the time of the opening of the seals and then when he did he entered into the ministry he was to bring and the son of man was brought into view as we were talking about the other day of Luke 17:30 in the day when the son of man would be revealed all right so they asked him a question and what will be the sign of thy coming he answered that in the opening of the seals he answered those three questions that I said this morning all right and what did we read in in Mark I mean in in Matthew 24 that it deals with in the six seal it will talk about the son of man do we know that this son of man I may not get finished I may have to have a message or two on this but this son of man would start in our day right be revealed made known but that Luke 17:30 will have to go to Israel because that's who will be there right the son of man and those two Prophets and will finally come to the position of his coming to Israel all right see that's Matthew uh what is it about 17 where he goes up on the mountain you know and the disciples go with him and when they get up on the mountain then you know he shows him Moses and elas and the order brother around said of his second coming the order of his second coming to the bride is what the word being revealed to you and I to purage us do what we were talking about this morning set us free get us clean uh wipe out our sins bring us to recognition of ourselves and then to come into the basis of changing these bodies that we're living in all right so then if you'll read future home you'll see more about what I'm talking about then see this world we are stepping we are a step ahead of the world in our Redemptive because we get a change of the body here right then the world has to go through a cleansing an ending of the world order as we ended up this morning talking on the six seal being the end of the world all right then it would come forth as being the the end of that and see then it will get a fiery baptism this world will but we're of it because that we're in the Redemptive plan we're the Bride of Jesus Christ am so then we can can see a little more about what we're talking about all now remember how we ended up talking about the prophet said they would have to be such a purging under that six seal that it would make ready a world for the Millennium that was what we ended up talking about you know where he said that the six seal is the end of the world that's paragraph 425 of The Sixth Seal and it was talking about getting ready for the Millennium all right see you and I as I kept emphasizing must be brought to a purging to us to be able to be prepared for a change of the body right and then we will go into the Millennium we don't go into the Millennium and then get a change of the body right we we are ahead of the world we're ahead of everything amen because we're the Bride of Jesus Christ now see what I want us to think on for this message today that I want you to think about that there's only six seals on the Plan of Redemption now the Seven Seals don't misunderstand me anybody don't hear me first time they don't understand me but remember the seventh seal is not written right and it says silence in heaven for space a half hour and there is no symbols like there was in 1 2 3 4 that the prophet had to break but then the fifth seal there was not any symbols it was people they given eternal life all right so you'll see why I kept I said that on each one all right and then in the seal there's not any symbols it tells you what it is the great earthquake and the great things that are taking place and and the moon tur into blood and all of the different things but see when you come to the seventh it just says silence in heaven for space of half hour all right then don't misunderstand when I keep repeating the six seals of redemption cuz that is that is the writing in the Bible it's written there in in the scriptures we read you know we've read chapter 6 up to verse what is verse 17 the entire chapter and then we've talked of it in Matthew 24 as to be the opening of the seals brother R said there was Jesus speaking it and he said and here's John writing it down in the scriptures all right he said and the third which was the confirmation is now God it's on the seventh seal I'm pretty sure is either that or the questions and answers that's what I've been listening to in when I've been deer honey is the six seal the questions and answers and the seven so then it's it's in the order now that there's only six seals written all right the seventh seal is not revealed okay so we can say there's six seals of redemption right and bring that into a position of understanding because the seventh seal won't give you a great mystery of redemption right I'll tell you what I think it is it is the product of redemption amen that's right it is the coming of the Lord amen your Prophet said amen it is the end of all things all right so then it is a lot to be understood there you know because that's the way the prophet has brought it unto us and like I said Jesus preached six seals he didn't preach the seven right why because that's what he was or who he was he was that God of the word and one day he'll be the god of the word again in the bride amen that's right to make a change in the body okay now in doing that then that's what I want us to think about I want us to think about the Plan of Redemption I said I'm laying this down to where we'll see this and then I'll come back and probably way to be preaching Wednesday cuz I want this to keep my mind in one channel and be able to uh I'll let him know when he gets here gets back and then that way I can got to keep my thought the way I want it to bring it and then we'll have questions and answers all right but let's get started on this point of what we're talking about and see it spoke of throughout the Bible said these seals I gave you that quote he said they're spoke of throughout the word he said they come all the way down through so we covered excuse me covered this morning of how that it was the purging we covered Wednesday how it was the the part of the you know the Judgment seal of the word the purging of everything the prophet said everything is purged under the sick seal all right so it'll make way for the Millennium to be able to come into view now let's think on this go ahead brother pull up number one let's get started everybody knows this story it's in the kinsman redeemer paragraph 175 he says we have the earnest of it now I've took home a whole scarf full of Arley all right he gave it to her now we know this is and Bo right measured it out six measures and watch it we always quoted it as Ruth receiving the seals all right hang on a second but we got to get the quote exactly right because if not somebody will come along and try to pull something with you of saying but that's not the way the quote is it doesn't say six se it says of the earth 6,000 years okay so let's start there he gave it to her and measured it out six measures six six meant the 6,000 years of existence of the world man's day is six Man was created on the sixth day that'll be 6,000 years that the world was created and the 7,000 God rested 6,000 years the church would labor against sin with the fire of God of these barley Loaves and then go into the Eternal rest that's rest wait six measures of fine barley what he put in there to carry her over till the time of full Redemption all right now the six measures of meal would mean the 6,000 years are you with me yes all right but if that was put there would be to carry her over till the time of full Redemption all right the six measures of meal okay and we know we don't have to go through that I've got it but Ruth 53 and 15 if he measured out six measures of barley and put it into her bag and sent her back to Naomi and then when she got back to Naomi you know she showed her what she had she said just stay where you at don't bother no more and he'll take care of this Plan of Redemption now we know what he done he had to go and pay the price he had to kick his shoe off he had to allow uh Satan the opportunity which was our nearest King kman we were all born kin folks to the devil where we like it or not you didn't become kin folks to have you born kin folks right to the devil all right the new birth makes us kin folks to God okay so he gave her six measures of Meal which in other words he told her say where you're at I'll take care of it Naomi tells you just leave it alone he's done give you his promise of six measures of meal he's done give you his promise to redeem right right so now then how many seals are they in the Plan of Redemption written in the word there only six seals right so he gave her six measures of Meal which would mean the six Church ages you know or excuse me 6,000 years of the earth and in that 6,000 years of the Earth You and I the ru that we're talking about the bride we are to get the Plan of Redemption right right which is six seals cuz the seven don't reveal anything so we're going to get to six time six for the 6,000 years we're going to get six seals now go ahead to number three this is paragraph 162 or 52 the bridge between the church ages and sealed notice now the book remember it's sealed here's one here this the seal and another one's wrapped around see another one's wrapped around see it's a book of redemption the whole Bible is a book of redemption right it tells us what will happen in the 6,000 years of mankind that's right and don't go too far haywi Haywire with it but we've done past that as far as man can calculate but remember God don't calculate like we do right all right now there a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes a book and it's sealed with Seven Seals and it's on the backside is because it's wound up the seal Myster is on the inside it only says the white horse rider and black horse rider whatever on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from Genesis to Revelation a complete Plan of Redemption is revealed in these Seven Seals All right now all we need to know is the Plan of Redemption but that's revealed to You and I by way of the prophet of God known as the seals people say well why they so important well if you don't want to be redeemed you're right it's not important that's right but if you want to be redeemed it's very important right then the prophet would say like in the Daniel 70 weeks if you don't understand these Daniel 7 ways you can't understand the seals right so why is it so important to understand the 70 weeks of Daniel because if you don't you can't understand the Plan of Redemption right what do you mean brother de I spoke tongue I believe the prophet I know all about one God water baptism no Eternal Hells do here plain language do you sure well then you didn't need the profit I guess but listen Church there's only six seals in that plan that's revealing something that's right making known something right all right look at the next one paragraph 392 of the seventh seal did you notice when Jesus asked him that you know when we compared the scripture here with Matthew 24 with the six seals the seventh was left out because you see Christ said only God himself know not even the angel no it wasn't even written you see you see they hushed nothing take place then a Angels don't know it nobody knows when he's coming but it it'll be seven voices of these Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time here now we find that the sick seal has been opened to us we see it and we know that this seventh seal it this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrives that's why people arguing over where the seventh seal Has Broken the Bible says it is all right but there's only six seals in it six seals to reveal the Plan of Redemption look at number five those that are in prison now at 138 none of the six seal were these trumpets open remember under there we find out that the lamb came forth appeared on the scene he left him Mercy Seat his work of redemption was finished he came forth and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and time was no more now according to that and what we've always tried to preach then the lamb can't leave The Mercy Seat until after Redemption is over are you reading it that's right well you know there's going to be Redemption after we leave out of here right right amen there'll be 144,000 right you got to deal with Israel right sealed youw that's blinded you got to deal with a lot of things you got to deal with the foolish virgin to be given eternal life so then we say redemption's over that's what they told me when they came into the message they said redemption's over 63 I said I'm sorry my Bible said it over for the foundation of the world right is not that the word I wasn't trying to be sarcastic I was trying to show the truth see the lamb leaving The Mercy Seat he cannot leave that Mercy Seat until that 144,000 is redeemed I thought he was he left The Mercy Seat come to us that's what I said you talk about one God we're just beginning to understand a little of the things the lamb has to stay on The Mercy Seat until Israel is saved that's right you see yeah but but that's where our butts come into we put our own thoughts in see we're looking at the word as it unfolds to show us the Plan of Redemption and we stand here already redeemed amen we get a change of the body and the Lamb's still on The Mercy Seat who f for Israel right so that's where we think of one God and we think well there's just one God you like you finger there's many forms of God that's right the lamb that leaves the mercy seat for you and I will take place and he'll become visible among us and take us into Rapture right but there'll still have to be a Plan of Redemption for Israel right that's right so God has many forms in morphes but he's only one person Richard and I been talking about this on the the things and I have them written down at the house cuz I was questioned that when we were speaking about the 70 weeks of Daniel that they said well will the marriage supper is only going to be 3 and 1/2 years said what are we going to do well that other three and a half years is going on y'all talking about you know what brother R says he said we're at to supper for 3 and 1/2 years he said Jesus slips back down here and reveals himself to the Jews right right they don't come back in a Corporal body right that don't happen to the Millennium so a form of God can come down and reveal himself to the two witnesses in 144,000 and Jesus ain't left us yet amen but if you need other things brother around and said he said like it was in Joseph he said Joseph's wife was in the house of pharaoh you know the ruler where Joseph's house was right he didn't throw her out in the backyard she was living in a home she remained there in the Palace of pharaoh brother around says when Jesus comes back he said the wife will be in the house of the father right okay you just wait a while the Lord will take care of everything but listen Church the book of redemption the book of redemption is a book of names that's right right we've been through that right right it's not a scoffield Thompson Chain or whatever but it's the Bible it's the Bible that was written before the foundation of the world because all names were WR were placed there in a book of redemption now then you got to divide that up because if you don't you got a problem because you got the book of redemption revealing the bride's names but you know the foolish virgins names were in the book and remain the 144,000 's name was in the book and remain just not in the section where the little bright at so we'll get to that in a minute the book of redemption brother say it's just a book of names the Bible is the record of what the names are Peter James John Paul but then it cords around there what's taking place God is The Book of Life but the book of redemption said God opened one of the seals and John saw his name and did he open one of the seals back there to John or when the seals were broke to John on patmas is that when he saw his name you see we talk about Redemption but do we know about redemption or are we still like it was in the old days the old preacher said you ain't going to heaven if you ain't Born Again everybody that ain't born again here in this world going to hell well you know we've seen that a little different now happen when we start dealing with Israel when we start dealing with the foolish virgins when we start dealing with 144,000 come find that there going to be a lot more in heaven right right but you know everybody's going to be there because of what Jesus done MH that's the way it should have been preached that's right he paid the price for everybody that's right in the Plan of Redemption but it's the work of redemption see this book was what was redeemed in this book it was a book of redemption and everything that he had red redeemed was written in that book don't you think that he did at Calvary redeemed the foolish virgin it just wouldn't applied to he redeemed Israel wasn't applied he redeemed 144,000 wasn't applied there still part of the Plan of Redemption so I don't know about that okay go ahead and pull up the next one 155 sold that are in prison now the lamb had redeemed it but it could not come forth until every name was revealed and that was taking place under the Sixth Seal before the seven broke so all names are revealed under the sick seal what a great Redemption seal it is and yet we think it's not important I just tribulation period that's what people says when you try to get an emphasis on about the first seal and it it's just a white Rider what about one seal time the entire Bible together on the Plan of Redemption what about one seal it doesn't mention in any other he doesn't mention them all names are revealed under the Sixth Seal before the [Music] seventh broke through all names of Redemption all who will ever receive eternal life their name has to be in the book we start should be starting to get a point that The Plan of Redemption is becoming vital to us that's right even though we're not there when the actual seal breaks but as it's coming forth down through manifesting itself up Through the Ages and times our names appear every name if you listening to what he said all the names that'll ever be redeemed is revealed under the sick seal you want to write that down and just ponder that thought and you'll see why that I said that there's only six seals of redemption the seven doesn't reveal anything my brother said it's his coming look at the next one 125 the six seal he's talking about because prior to scriptures and all the great secret of mystery that was under this six seal of the book of redemption so that's under the six seal now remember these seals are in Mysteries and the six seals all together is one great big book just six scroll roll together it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the world was redeemed so there's only six seals in the Plan of Redemption but all names is revealed under the Sixth Seal so you don't need a seventh seal showing you some Plan of Redemption oh there one great big book right every name that will ever be was put on that book before the foundation of the world Amen and when the sick seal finally breaks in reality all names that would ever be there is there because even that foolish virgin is purged during that Great Tribulation she doesn't have white robes but she's purged 144,000 are purged that's when we look at it we just say the Bible or the book of redemption there's a question or a problem when you're studying the church age book and brother brandom tells us about it because in that church age book I ask you to read from page 266 I believe it is 264 where it starts with the names blotted out I ask you to read that and brother says that's going to be confusing of the two books but he said it's not two books that's right there's only one book right mhm with two sections amen one of them he said is The Book of Life there is no such thing as adding your name to the Lamb's Book of Life it was either written out before the foundation of the world or will never be written right amen but there's two sections of that one book one of them is The Book of Life you remember he told Judas for speaking about him Rejoice not that your names told the disciples are written in heaven you know judas's name was written in the book of life right but your Prophet said but not in the Lamb's Book of Life section that's right not in the Eternal section there two sections when you become a to a religious order in your journey of Christianity your name is written in the book of life that's why you're here on Earth that's not talking about the Lamb's Book of Life it was written before the foundation of the world right book of life has to do with your natural Life we'll read these in a second your life and your journey that's why I said this Bible this Bible speaks of Matthew Mark Luke John but at the same time it speaks of pharaoh and all of the people they were wrong all the Pharisees and think it speaks of them in this Bible that doesn't give them eternal life because their name is written in the Bible but it does mean that they had a part to do with the religious order of their day now watch that as we go along you see a complete Plan of Redemption is written in the Bible but there's only six seals written in this Bible right the Seven's not written right this say silence for space half an hour all right we'll get down to that when we get into the seventh seal and the ability to be able to receive from under that because of what we studied down through the seals but there's only six seals to reveal its plan and if we're not part of that six seals as it reveals the ages and the times and the people and who it is and whatever don't worry about it we won't be there right but because of you being here today you're part of a religious order cator around and I'm quoting from Brother Bram worship of God your name can be in the book of life section and not be in the Eternal section that's where these other people will come up when we get into the Plan of Redemption I'm trying to make a foundation for this I may have to preach Wednesday to get that point across but all names are revealed under the six seal whether or not you're going to be right or whether you're going to be Israel if they're listening or foolish virgins if our names are not in the book you remember the prophet when he was saying the people say oh my name was written you know the other night written he said there's no such thing it was written before the foundation of the world or it'll never be written that's right that's right but what about Judas could walk with Jesus for three and 1/2 years part of a religious Order cast out Devils heal the sick preach the gospel and his name was taken out okay so that's what makes it confusing he said let's just read a few things if I don't get this part of I'll get the rest that Wednesday go ahead with number nine this is PR 119 Works Express works and Faith Express just like last night speaking when you get the book you're going to see maybe he talking about the church age book cuz it didn't come out until up in' 65 all right the church age book was put out long in ' 65 it wasn't brother Thomas and him back I know it wasn't put out when it was written down that was when brother R was preaching brother Lil took and reg grammar IED it in time it came out in 65 now just like last night speaking when you get the book you're going to see maybe a little confusion there of what I said the two books of life it's the same book is that what I've just been saying right but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other go ahead with the next one invisible Union par 26 204 205 here brings into view the two books that's going to be mysterious when you read the book of The Seven Church ages the two books book of life said one says you can put your name on it you never comes you never comes off other one says you take his name out of The Book of Life these things is perfectly in view right here he said I'm going to try to explain it the two books what happens to an individual I'm trying to get this down to where that I can just run through the plan and you'll say that was message so and so so and so so and so and when you come into the world we don't believe you came into the world with eternal life right I don't believe that I don't believe the prophet taught it that way got a quote work said always was eternal yeah read the quot [Music] if you have eternal life right right right you don't read that part you come in the world with eternal life Jesus Christ died in vain amen why the prophet say always was eternal if you have eternal life that eternal life you have always was eternal God is a part of God's own life Zoe we in the world is lost people then we begin to maybe think about God getting a little concerned and we started going to church we begin to hear a message that we must be saved and as we do we begin to get relation to that you know and we get new the stages of our journey of justification as we call it sanctification we become part of a religious order of people you know what happened God writes your name in a book not the Eternal section that's written for the foundation of the world all right he puts your name in the book let's see if that's true go ahead to number 11 page 272 of the sardian church age which church age book now I am sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in The Book of Life were part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God In Worship of him though they did not worship according to True Word like Judas they didn't go all the way but their name was written in the book see if you take the Bible and think about it you think about those names that were written in the L's book of life before the foundation of the world and then you think about that one day you came to Earth and you became a human mortal lost doomed right but you begin to go to churches in said you begin to being associated with religious matters in people you know what when God puts your name in the book what he done to Judas if you read what I gave you 266 to 280 something of the church age book you hear him explaining four classes of people which we never would have thought about all of those things one of them is the Bride of Jesus Christ her name is written in the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world number two is people whose names were written in the Book of Life and they'll go on one day and receive eternal life number three is people like Judas who had his name written there but had his name taken number four is people that were never written nowhere said now no doubt there is a record written of them and right here it is the Bible right right this is the record of all four classes of people we just talked about this record tells of a people whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain and they will receive eternal life here in this world as part of the body of Christ there is a group here that becomes religious and part of an order and they'll give their life for the gospel but they have to go to the white Throne to receive eternal life because their name is not in the eternal life section it's only the end of pages of this book of The Natural Life out here then there's people like Judas that'll have his name removed and you know we think about how hard it would be to have a name removed not very hard all you got to do is blashe the Holy Ghost right all it tell you you blashe the Holy Ghost but Jesus said he won't be forgiven and this world or the world to come that's what he said right he said how hard or what would you do to bless me just make some front of somebody see somebody shouting and you laugh at them see somebody with long hire you make fun of them you're a preacher preaching under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and you life at what is being said it or denied is say wrong you Blas me in the Holy Ghost what did the Bible say what did the prophet say blaspheming the Holy Ghost is not just drinking gambling smoking running around with women and stuff like that the blashe the Holy Ghost is attribute the works of God to the devil amen that's the summing up of the whole old thing when you attribute the works of God to the devil in other words when you say that's the devil doing that that's the devil that made that sister where long haire that's the devil that made him not wear you know long I made them wear long dresses and not wear short one cut their hair and things that's blaspheming the holy ghost that won't be forgiven in this world the world to come because it's God keeps a record yes sir but listen part of a religious order puts your name in the book of life eternal life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost reveals to you that your name name has always been written did you understand the way I stated that to have your name in The Book of Life is good but that's not eternal life one leads out to the other the prophet said but the lounge Book of Life is eternal life you receive eternal life you can never be lost brother Mo used to make a good point about it he said you can't sin enough to be lost if you're bornn again course if you're born again you're not going to try to sin very long right right people go on and they live like the devil for 20 years and say I've been born again but I just backslid now ain't no Bible for that the only the statements that your Prophet gave in the Hebrew Book was of the man that went out and was a preacher and sat down and got drunk a couple of weeks later he died right God ain't going to let you Mar his name for 40 years but don't make excuses well I've been saved now all youve lost right and remember what we brought out this morning if you don't admit you're lost you're under condemnation and need a purging from that thought the best thing to do is say I'm lost I need salvation yes Lord but now brother if I say I'm WR then I'm afraid I might be lost well if you say you're saved and ain't saved ain't much better off right amen you can't at least keep saying until God comes on the scene right but think about it you know when your name goes on the book as a believer have a number 12 brother what's your Prophet had to say his questions and ansers real three 64 8:30 the morning service paragraph 295 sanctification is when your name goes on the book as a Believer that's part of a religious order we just got through read your name is wrote in this Blood see sanctification does that you come up when he stretched you this far then come up you said well would he know it yes he knowed it he knows you wouldn't do it in the beginning he know Judas wouldn't do it he knowed from the beginning he was a son of predition but them thing them thing has to be fulfilled see the word has to be fulfilled and little together topes and and shadows so when does your name go in the book of a Believer sanctification when you reach the stage of sanctification in your journey your name is written in the Book of Life not the Eternal section those these two sections of one book if you can't see the Bible that way I don't understand it because the Bible tells a natural story of exactly where we are now that's right right exactly where we are now in the seventh Church Age The Bad and The Good is written about us right right mhm that put your name brother said it's not Arman Neville he said it's what's going on on Arman Neville is on Earth that that puts his name in the book so don't look for dick Addison you won't find it that's right and just because m is Samuel that ain't too good either because Dale wind up on the end of it and that's what messed us up but you see we were born Sinners MH amen that's right lost right y we become a part of a religious or order by coming to a Sanctified state in life centered around as we read there a moment ago the worship of God do you know what those old Pharisees names was written in the book judas's name was written in the book you're part of a religious order your name's written in the book that's the danger part cuz can be removed right right if you reach only sanctification in your journey you never heard brother R say you be saved today and lost tomorrow he says according to your confession well I thought eternal life he ain't talking about eternal life you can't have eternal life today and lose it that's why I'm born Christian cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost right you said well look what I done that's all right you need to repent of it and get rid of it right but you can't blashe the Holy Ghost if you got the new birth right see God knew that Paul was coming to that new birth and Paul said even causing others to blaspheme that's right did but he said God forgave me because I done it in in ignorance but are you listening part of a religious order going to church and being religious makes people responsible to become a part of a point to where you become to sanctification that's the most dangerous stage of your journey because you think that you're all right you get new desires new thoughts new ideas you want to go to church you want to worship because you're part of a religious order but if you don't go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're foolish virgin your name will remain but if not it will be taken off now remember I said there were four classes your Prophet gave in that church age book the number four was those whose names were never written nowhere that's not a hot and toau in Africa that's never heard the truth that's people sometimes that go to church but don't go far enough or some that won't go to church at all but it won't become to a part of a religious order of sanctification they just go to church they're name in the book and then the preacher when they when they die what does the preacher say we know old brother so and so he had some problems but we all got problems all of us got problems the brother just had a little more problems than we got problems but we all got problems you've been to them hav you but I know his name was written in the book of life but he wrote it down on our records when he got saved the old Independent Baptist laid heavy on that when your name was written in that little car that you had about that long about like that your name was written in heaven the other Baptist believed pretty close because if you went to another church you had to call for your little card right and on that little card it would tell whether you was a member in good standing or not I read one time back years ago cuz I used to read as much as I could about some of those matters and and this fell is about 20 times that he joined the church well I guess he had 20 cards or either he had one card with 20 writings on cuz they actually believe people do that when your name is written in that church role God wrote it in heaven well that sounds like what you're talking about no when you become part of a religious order not join a church you see the four classes is ring there are people that names are written there they'll always be there go to in Eternal section and they will come to it there are people that their names was written there that will never come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they'll give their life for what they believe and will be given eternal life into white Throne there are people like Judas whose name was written there that had it removed that's what made him the son of predition but then there's a group of people his name's not written nowhere what part are we of what do you mean brother de I believe everything Prophet said oh my my computer does too it don't get upset when I Ty in something it just pulls it out tells me where it's at what about it two books I finally found it Church age book you're supposed to read from PR page 265 to 286 that's pretty close but now think about it for a moment I'll leave the other off cuz I know I can't get it I'll go ahead and take Wednesday preach on it sister Julie back a year or so ago asked me to preach on this I had got to it yet so I guess I can do it now that Dan and ephraim's names are removed you yet their names put back in and how that can take place so we wait a Wednesday so we'll just stop on that point Point your name goes on to look as a Believer when you start going to church and start trying to do right and you know what that makes you responsible you remember how we do when we dedicate a baby we say everybody in the building is dedicating themselves to live before this child right right if you don't live before that child a correct life you're a problem right if we're to live before those children and believe it see then becoming part of a religious order and this Bible comes into view that's right and it has the names not written out it has the names of every believer because it has what's going on in the age that we're living written in this book it tells you how good we are it tells how bad we are when you get to the church ages I'd invite you to read those Church ages it tells of two Vines there True Vine the false Vine then it gets on so Clos to you can't tell the difference the true and the false right see church this thing is not to just live good and one of these days maybe we'll get to heaven it's not that way it's being not a part of a religious order to where we go to church you remember when you first started maybe you thought you were saved maybe it was that's not to me but you started the church and you begin to want to do better you wanted to quit the things you were doing and get clean because you were a Christian and Christians don't not act like that yeah well see that's a part of the religious order of mankind you know the devil is very very religious he's not out there in The Honky TS today you know where he's at sitting right here they always say in a lot of churches they say well the reason we don't have very many people in our church church because we leave places for the angels to sit that might be justified not having a whole lot of people but because if the building here would be packed out and we've seen it a few times but you know the angels of God are still here that's right but you know the devil's still here too see he's interested in finding out you see a man get on the field and he starts running people in this message you remember it in your mind especially young they they just really get on fire and boy they come into the message and they've been in it about 3 months and boy they straightening out everybody they know all about it they just straightening everybody out and people just start flocking to it that's a religious order they run with that person for a while and after a while they find them another person to run with for a while thinking each one of them is going to be the one that's going to take them to Heaven bring the P the Rapture Etc so they're running to and fro let see why can't we just settle down and say one thing that Peter said that brother ROM paraphrased it Peter said this is that you remember this is that that was spoken of in the word the holy up brother Brown said if this ain't that let's keep this till that gets here that's right good right I run about the country seeking after new things why not just settle down and just go day by day and then let the word just cleanse us out and Purge set us aside we happen to be here as chosen I guess to be the one that people's come to because we've had very little going out but people come here to want to hear well that's good because that shows that there's something within you but it's like I told Richard and mentioned it to do you I told him I said I don't want you in Lula because that you're just my son-in-law I said I want you Lula because of the word that you hear and want to be a part of you see when you come that way we don't have no problem right if you be like the brother said I came from place and came to Lula to follow the Lula thing that's what he told me I said that's where you messed up cuz there ain't no lul so you come out here looking for something they ain't no Lula thing we just part of the body of Christ amen well it proved out that he was looking for some other thing cuz he left went other places right so he must have found some words else that had a thing you know well but listen Church all names are revealed on the six seal there's not a name revealed on the Sabbath and the reason it's put on the six is because it is the ending of redemption so it have to be under the six that everything would be revealed that our names would be revealed there and Israel would be revealed there the 144,000 would be revealed there the foolish virgins would be revealed there and their Redemptive plan remember if you're people talking about salvation you got to have a place to go to or your salvation has no value see Church all names are not written in this Bible like writing out the name with all names they would ever be saved or lost they're written in this book even the prophet said even that fourth class that their name is written he said no doubt there is a record made somewhere I going to ask you to read what I'm give you in the church age book CU then you're going to see that we're going to come to that we're going to come through that and read it Wednesday in a lot of ways you said well my name is written in in the blood of Jesus Christ it's true our names were written in the book of life but then when you get to a little message called The Invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ your Prophet said your name is transferred come on read the book book your name is transferred what from a religious order from a sanctified people to a born again believer amen that's right to find out your name was written in the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world not to shout Glory Hallelujah how Eternal we are but how did we get redeemed now I just end it with one point if you say we need to be redeemed okay then you're admitting at one time you was lost right right right right why would you say you've been redeemed so let's don't saying I'm redeemed anymore if we always was eternal if we don't need salvation then let's don't talk about it but must be what's happened to the people the message cuz they certainly cutting off the message something tantalizing to the [Music] ear something to make you feel good oh can't you just remember when it Napoleon that put his hand in and walk like that or something can't you just remember you was back there well brother around saw me there yeah he said I've been in both places right right that's right so he's been beyond the curtain of time and he's been to Hell which one was you there that's right well now you just turn me down turn you down trying to get you to look at yourself and find out whether your name was written there or not my Bible says examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not that's right it don't say examine everybody else that's what we want to do right it say to examine yourself because all names are are revealed on the six seal There's No Redemption P there just as we were talking this morning and about it where the Prophet said the six seal is the end of the world he's not talking about it being the end of the or annihilating a world he's talking about the world order that we exist under Armageddon will take care of this situation amen right think on these things home brother well then all names will have to be revealed where was your name revealed brother Dale in the word of God and the six seal brought it out cu the six seal purges everything what about it one seal tie the entire Bible together let's stand again what we got uh 136 in a minute B 136 in the red book anybody have need we e Play We Are
