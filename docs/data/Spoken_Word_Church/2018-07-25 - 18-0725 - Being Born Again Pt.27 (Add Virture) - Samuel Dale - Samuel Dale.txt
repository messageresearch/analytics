unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever alright let's go over to into 2nd Peter 1 it says Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be on to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine divine power the given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory in virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all giving all diligence beside this now giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue or knowledge a knowledge temperance and we're going through but we're just going through the part there of virtue tonight so you you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word we as I said we had a good time over the weekend and enjoyed the brother and and everything and we didn't discuss anything and all in he he came right in on the the preaching on the the things of the Statue of a perfect man so I hope that was good for you and and giving understanding and you know to follow in into the message that we're trying to bring all right now we've had this is 27 messages so far and we're gonna start the Lord Williams we tend to not on beginning the actual virtues and see how each one lays in order and what they're doing but the main thing I want you to understand I want to ask you the question you know do you realize what the Word of God is far in this last days as it don't upon you of what it is to be or what is to take place see we know that according to Malachi 4 that God is supposed to restore the faith of the original Apostolic fathers to the little bride in the end time all right now but do we really realize that and look at that as what's taking place are we looking back to it somewhere or something are looking forward to some other point and missing what's taking place now that's the main point I want to think about I want to dis ask you the simple question you know do you realize the hour that we're living you realize the time that we're living upon this earth it's the time of the opening of the Word of God to the bride of Jesus Christ to get her ready to go out of here in a rapture you know alright in doing that then there's things that must transpire you know and and we we believe that and we're looking forward to a lot of things to transpire I mean I'm I'm one that looks forward and backward but I try to stand in the middle of where I'm at because that way I can look backwards and forward you know if I move forward I can't look forward i'm i'll be looking backwards or something you know it won't work but the point i want you to think about I want to ask you just a simple question do you realize and do you really believe it and put all of your thoughts and your hopes and and everything that this message was delivered unto you and I to bring us to the stature of a perfect man all right because that was the part that was lost the not the new birth no see that's where we get that confused in our thinking a lot of times it wasn't the new birth that was lost down through the ages each age had the new birth all right it was Christ in each age to bring forth in that age and and he in having that but what was lost was these virtues that the disciples had and then when you come over you got you can't confirm pom worm locust caterpillar now as they come forth and ate the tree down and you know brought it to a position to her that no longer was the church walking in the direct light and understanding of the original of the day of Pentecost right that's the point I want you to think about is to make sure you understand that I mean we've tried you know after many messages to try to get that point across to us it's not to just talk about these things it's not to just discuss it and all like that we've done that in organized religion they're doing that now they're discussing whatever would you say they're talking about the Word of God and you see great moves and different things taking place among organized religion and and they're they're just not sitting there dried up they're trying to move on but they don't know how to move on because that's what we've we've come to all right now get to get the point of I thought if we realize that something has been taken away you know then we must realize what that is okay and then if it's taken away and promised to be restored all right then we must look at the fact of seeing that it is being restored not you know way out sunder it's now all right so then we read the Bible you know of Melaka forward we see that God promised but he told the cankerworm palm warm locust caterpillar would eat the church down but then it would come to a promise of a restoration back to the faith of the father's all right now what is the faith of the father's it's the revelation that the Apostles had of Jesus Christ back there and it was brought forth you know their reach faith understanding he and they had the truth of of one God water baptism no eternal hail we didn't have you didn't have to wait until these you know you didn't have to wait for the Prophet to bring these things but like the one God - water baptism with no eternal hell the things like that the Apostles taught these things they taught of predestination they taught of all of those things it was lined up back there with them alright see all right then if that's true then it has to be lined up in you and me to be restored back to us alright let's see do you realize that that's what's taking place or is it just a going to church and being good you know is it something like that that we're looking forward to you know are we looking to a point to think well maybe one of these days there's going to be some great something take place you know and the great movements and great things will transpire is that what we're looking for well that's well and good and all right you know no problems with nobody the problem I have is with all of us not being seeing what's taking place now right now you know all right see we can look back and see what took place we see the faith of the fathers was dark we see the Prophet come to bring us the message to restore that back to us all right we can see it in his ministry and him and walking in the light all right we can see all of that right then there's things that will transpire you know take place in this end time because there's got to be a change of the body there's got to be a lot of things to transpire all right we've got a a lot to look forward to but now let's don't do this let's don't settle down on thinking about what has been but now don't settle down and not move forward into what that we see I'm a firm believer in that like I've always told you there the other week when we were talking about the revival I've always it's always been in my heart since hearing this message and the Prophet and speaking the way he did of a revival and not to be any more of these worldwide sweeping revivals the next one of those will be to Israel through the two witnesses all right we got that right then we have the understanding but I've always believed in a revival I've always believed it because the Prophet said you know that the bride hasn't had a revival yet well now then he's not talking about Oh a world sweeping revival you know that's not the point but it's a word revival and I've been in that ever since I've been in this message it's always been a wonderful thing to me to be able to read the Word of God and to think about you and I being able to understand what the prophets and things that's hard to look into it you realize that that you have an understanding of God in the way that the prophets were not capable of reaching to that position and the great people down through time even to the apostles and things that you are going to go beyond them into the basis they never reach the change of the body right see the great Apostle Paul that could speak over the change in the mantra but yet he never attained to it we seem to think about that you and I have the opportunity to be able to walk in that place is a great thing we'll see that's the kind of revival I'm looking for that's the kind of point that I've always tried to get you to talk about or see is the opening of God's Word see then in realizing that knowing that if we believe that the church was eaten down and must be restored you know the word to the bride well alright then what was eaten down what we call the statue of a perfect man alright going on in to adoption and those things that the Apostles talked of during the dark ages of the it was just eating away to her that it was no longer the goal or the drive of the church it had just become to a dried up state of going to church and being good right and all of that's well and good but that's not the whole story you know you go over here and you set out in this church and and you you just forget a few little things about this that or the other about what you're doing and you sit down and listen to these people they're talking about God they're talking about great things happening they're talking about healings they're talking about you know they're not just sitting there dried up with nothing they're talking about those things well that's what we're doing but that's where the prophets said that's what it had wound up to be it had wound up he said to be just a church-going people without any goal or drive whatsoever to move on other than to just be good Christians you know he said well that what else what you won't then good Christians well if the Prophet was right he wasn't throwing off on people that were good Christians but he said that's where they missed it at was thinking that was it remember what he preached on that he said that's where Pentecost failed that's where the the Pentecostals failed in the in their their point that they thought it was all dire it was finished it was what they had was it and he said no he said you just got started well see you're telling people that are having and listening you don't think like they're you're telling people I brought around it was telling people that was having signs and wonders every day and we write the Pentecostal people were in the move and thing and having great signs and wonders and you're telling them that that's not all of it right was that what he was telling them that's not all of it we need to go on because that's not just what the disciples had you know we've got to get back to that place of the world and the things they had and see then by looking at it and seeing the Word of God unveiled in our day to show us where we're at and what's taking place all right now I know I'm I'm cutting it dry and thoughts but I'm wanting you to think I want you to think one time do you realize this is the end time do you realize that you realized there is not another move of God there is not another thing to come another revival another this Saturday we're in the last days we're in the finishing up of all things but we have to realize that sure as I said there's things to take place we're looking forward to things but yet are we looking at what's taking place as being what it is to make way for that whatever is to come now think about this for a second whatever is to come there must be a background right form a right teaching right right there must be something set in motion to be prepared for that when it does come that's all I've ever told how many times have you heard me say you can't go to the bus depot and wait on the plane just get worth of bus depots that and wait on God get into the word if we're looking forward to a change of the body he said once don't see nothing going on with us that's not going to bring you to that that's not going to bring us to the position but to come back to the original faith that those disciples had is that word now listen I'm trying to explain something I'm thinking about it today if I can Lord how can I get that to the people I don't believe that we're getting right of what we're talking about like the statue of a perfect man and the adoptions and the things I believe that we're either putting it behind or we're pushing it forward away from us and and we either making it too big to attain are too small to overlook now that's that's the whole point of what I'm talking about see we're overlooking what's taking place and to see the hour at a time that we're living is the greatest opportunity there is that a church could ever have to be able to believe in God and living where we're at I believe in a Christian life I believe in living a Christian life but I don't believe that we're looking at a Christian life in the way that we should that we're looking at it as a happiness a joyous or this that or the other you know a move of feelings of emotional things we're looking at it on that level instead of looking at it the way God is trying to bring it and I've tried to explain this over and over what would you do if we look at there far the apostles and we look at the great things happening well what would happen if you were able to reverse the situation and put those apostles where we are you don't see the point of that of what I'm thinking what if you brought him down here where we're at they had a pharisees and the sadducees organization to fight against and we've got ten thousand demons knock come on now is it the Prophet even told us on on the message that those demons was loosed on the bride to drive her to the message of the hour two hundred thousand thousand demons I can't even calculate test some says that's two hundred million I don't know I can't get enough numbers together to come out worse at but get what I'm talking about what if they were up hearing us back guard would they be like we are or would they be so over joyous and don't you know no I don't look for something like that people want a great revival of feeling good and good things and enjoy not like a everybody loves that the presence of God but what about those things on anointed ones they can have it on their spirit and rejoice and shout in glory hallelujah right and be still lost you understand what I'm saying what if we could trade places with them and let them come down here they they'd be real quick to tell you saying let's swap back go will face the lines and and the dungeons and the killings and the things over what y'all have in the face so you realize every day is a demon battle but a run said those I'm quoting him that he said what they used daily to overcome it's the same thing you use daily to overcome it's the same holy spirit what's your point brother there I'm not looking for something to break loose into such a joyous festivity of shouting glory hallelujah I wish that was true I've never looked at it like that I'm looking at the word opening and as the word opening it settles within our souls and our being something that Satan cannot take away from us something that you can be anchored in and that will bring joy unspeakable and full of glory to you see maybe you don't understand me on that sets I try to explain something and as I do I know that I get people confused I'm not an emotional type of a person but yet within me there's more emotions than anybody in this building because I know what I rejoice about I rejoice over the opening of God's Word that's my joy that's my daily thing that's my point of Lord help me open my eyes I want to see what God is I was thinking about him so much the other day till I was just watching him walk down a road you know you said well what do you want I just tell it like it is that's what I saw but see I'm I'm a point trying to get a point to you of what is it to be a Christian and are you looking for the statue of a perfect man to bring you to a great joy and a great thing beyond and and do away with all your troubles and all of your problems and heartaches if that's what you're looking for I think we're missing the statue of a pretty man by a whole lot because I always thought the closer we get to God the worst Satan gets after us you know brother dae-ho I'm just not as happy as I used to be I'm just you know the joy is just not in my heart that used to be there why well we're in the end we're in the finishing up of all of these things we're in the point of should be the most joyous people in the world why should we be sad about anything we have the word we have the holy spirit to quicken that word and we know what to look forward to it's adoption and the statute of perfect man the same thing to you the growth development of Christianity but not growth development of a whole lot more emotions because you see Satan can impersonate that he can bring the emotions to you he can bring those things to you but is the word the important thing Lulla they just word word word word word well that's all I've ever been so they don't need to be in nothing else you know I'll take that part and to stay with it because that's what I've always been I've always been one to want to understand God's Word not intellectually understand it not to read it more than you read it not to know it by head knowledge we'll get to that when we get to knowledge and what knowledge really is you realize the only knowledge there is worth anything is God's knowledge holy ghost' knowledge that's the only that's how simple it is holy ghost' knowledge is the greatest of all but yet do you do you follow me of understanding do you really see what's taking place in this day or are you just sitting and wondering what's going on well I just don't see that and I just don't see that I don't see that what are you looking for well brother that well now you've got some reason for everything you do right I mean we all got a reason what's your reason what's your thoughts well I think it ought to be this way well okay you know what I've always said if you think something around this church or to be changed when are you gonna start doing it right now I've put it back in your life ain't it you think well we need to shout more that's what I've been selling pastor so don't worry about it and I've been with people you know all these years and they say well we need to have more emotions and to tell you the God's honest truth I've talked to people and say we need more emotion and there was a drives person in the whole building the deadest person was the one that was wanting to do you know won't fell emotional and they're dead if you want emotions work on it if you want to join us happy time work on it start doing it yourself you remember what happened with a lady that was cleaning the church and she just cleaned it in wiping the seats and Lord bless his person Lord bless this person you know what it started revival in the whole church if you want to see something moving get up do it but what I hate is the fact of people will notice ain't nothing going on with you're dead if church is around well you know what if you're the one that saying that you're the deadest person in the building brother though yeah yeah I know it I'm hateful and arrogant and everything in the world but is it true we were here one time remodeling a little bit in the church and and we had got to a place we had to change some things around here and we were downstairs and we've got something to eat and we were sitting there eating and you know and everybody was talking about what we need to do this well we need to do this you know they wouldn't agreeing upon what we needed to get up and go do they wanted need to do this we need to do this and don't need to do that well after a while they asked big he said were Sam said he's up your honor doing what he's gonna do cuz I ain't gonna sit around and talk about it I'm gonna get up and go do it that's what we all need that to me you know maybe that's trying to explain a point but it is I'm not you know to be over joyously half in and in the Lord and worship it and everything is wonderful but if it's all of my cup then it ain't worth it but if it's because of something with inside of you and that's what I'm asking what do you think is it to talk about I will restore the years of the cankerworm locusts the caterpillar pom worming now what are you expecting to take place you have some reason some thought in your mind everybody in the building have some thought or concept about what they think it should be or what it is or what what are we trying to put that into action right or are we just sitting down blaming everybody else that's pretty easy in there to blame everybody else for something not being done once you get up and go do it right you know you know what I'm saying get up get it get it to working you know you want something change get out go do it well they won't listen to me they don't like my ideas well you ever tried putting them in action we might not know your ideas you put them in action listen Church I'm trying to tell you one time if we're looking for something to come that's going to be a great joyous you know move and etc and things like that of going in to the time of the change of the body I don't look like that I look it as an everyday action and a final reaction brother mote used to have a good point you know I mean you walking up the rungs of a ladder it's the same distance it's wrong if it's made correctly you see it's the same distance your steps out here brother Geary they're these carpenters can tell you there's a certain set on that step and your insurance in your home probably a lot of you that's got a basement if they come and check your insurance they would tell you about it if they checked your home it's got to be so much up and so much out each one and it's got to be precise you know why do you know why that those steps has to be made precise to be covered by insurance because your human mind is set and if it's set to weather this up five inches out seven inches every what it is your mind sets that in the motion and you go to a set of steps that's out of motion you'll stumble you'll hit he said I know you talked to these brothers that are carpenters they can cancel your insurance over the pitch of your basement or your sub stars steps because the human mind is set to that exact movement and you can trip and fall then what are you talking about I'm talking about every day in our Christian life walk every day the same walk every day the same be happy every day rejoice every day would be the same every day see then that way the Statue of a perfect man our adoption is not some action our reaction of an individual it's a growth development in the Word of God right it's growth development because what was taken away the word was taken away and Satan made us a set of steps without it being in precise order and his calls the stumbling is involving but if we get it all in order and walk according to the disciples are another word according to the Word of God then it'll come out to fit all the way through the printer Branham says a lot of things that really Oh forgive me for the terminologies we don't have common sense enough to explain what I see but brother branham a lot of times says a lot of things that are really confusing now unit of read norm drum Tomba you that ain't read you just think I'm trying to make some garbage can you that are well read no I know exactly what I'm saying is true but you that are not well read you're confused you that are well read in the message no brother Brennan says a lot of things in the same verse you'll say something in the same verse see or say something sounds like it's totally contrary right in the same sentence well he can't be that confused but a lot of times he's explaining something in terminologies to try to help us like in the stature of a perfect man and it into the basis of you know looking at the word that we are to be partakers of his divine nature that we just read do you realize in that then you've got to cover that in two parts to understand it because to be partakers of his divine nature is the new birth it's the new birth to be partakers of his divine nature but then you're just getting into the body to where you can become partakers of his divine nature Rutter brenell covers for takers of his divine nature but then he comes over to positioning Christ and he says after you're born again into the body then you become partakers of his divine nature now that's two things one is that the new birth is a partaker of the divine nature the next is in the body of Christ in the growth development then you become a partaker of his divine nature so you're kidding to the stature of a perfect land that's what I'm asking the question do you understand do you understand the stature of a perfect man because there's nowhere in the statute of a perfect man that brother branham will define something like this well you've got this here but when you get these other things boy you're gonna be happy you're gonna be he never expresses it read the book he doesn't describe that the Christian you know in the in the becoming a new birth the difference between it and a growth development in Christianity he doesn't define that a lot he just makes the statement and see then that way we have to become partakers of his divine nature by the new birth that we received Jesus Christ into our soul but then that just starts it because that's what he was telling those Pentecostals see they were saying we've got the new birth he agreed with him they were saying we've got this and now look what we've got we've gotten a great ladder rain he said nonsense he said you had to form a rain yet he said you've got to have the form of rain for you have the latter rain and said what it is you're just a bunch of babies he didn't decrease you neither on to make him lost he made them to the point of what they were babies and that they needed a growth development to become mature Christians you see that's what I'm trying to say to you do you understand what the new birth is have I spent enough time preaching on the new birth to get you to see that it's the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you that changes your very nature to his nature we get that new birth is just a baby have we spent enough time into that to understand it then it just makes you a baby see the Pentecostals time with oh we all got it we got it all where we live he said no you don't have it he said you just come to the place to get him started was he T Christianizing them no was he telling them they were lost no get me the book the Titans showed me where he was telling though son look at him tell him you're right you've got these things right that's it now what we need is the statue of a perfect man and to do that we're going to have to have the word reveal to us the word the disciples had he's got to be in the bride for her to be able to attain unto what they had adoptions tax with perfect men manifested sons of God whatever the terminology is you want to use you see church we don't want to belittle something and make it too little but we don't want to make it too big till you can't attain unto it because that's what people say well brother deal I've got the new birth praise God I've got it just like today at Pentecost okay praise God but that's not the way the Prophet would cover it he covered getting the new birth first and then obtaining to the day of Pentecost and what they had a restoration I don't I don't get you all right listen if we have to be partakers of his divine nature then how do we become partakers of it you're gonna start in a new birth you remember elements with time we spent with brother around and said how faith and be born again he said then these are the things God expects you to add and see then what we look at it as something that's to be added you know some ad or something it looks like some great big something in front of us but then he'd make it so simple right you rented our supposed to read over and over what is the word virtue mean those we're to be protectors of his divine nature and to do that we're going to have to have his virtues what are the virtues of God we can call it the gifts you can go through that that's fine we did we took parts and show it but what is it talking about when you come down to we need to be partakers of these divine natures this to become protectors of the word because only by eating the word can we become anything see that's why I stay after you about listening to tapes and reading and praying because that way is the only way we'll ever be anything in God cause now you remember what the Prophet said try to get to the point he said now virtue he said we've got to have it and said it's his divine nature that we've got to have now how do you get His divine nature well I just get born again in brother Dale it's automatic see that's there if we throw that it's just an automatic and that's quote for the Prophet but what does it mean what if he talking about that it's automatic I thought that we had established through the message of the hour of and read it enough from you know the church age book 327 I think it is in it where he says this messenger of Malachi for Luke 17 13 I would do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to divine revealed the thunders which is revelation contained in the seven seals alright then I thought that we had the at the ability now to be able to attain unto these things you didn't ever think well how can we get them we need these virtues if you read the statue of perfect man you know brother Owen said we've got to have these virtues even puts it to the rat sure well not if we've got to have these virtues how do we get them so we know that it's true getting to the original faith that they had that's the part it's being automatic the part is being automatic is when you yields yourself to God and let him take over and run us automatically not just automatic what I mean I think this I got every bit of that when I saved I've just automated it just automatic no the Prophet said he'd be automatically added one through the opening of the word through the opening the word will automatically add his nature and see that's where the things like I said this reason all of that is a back of a part to just get to one little thing read around on what is virtue we need virtues how do we get virtue we get it by the growth development of God's Word as he reveals himself to us it brings us virtue because what is virtue now why would ruther Branham say in the statute of perfect man explaining virtue and his first statement was he said now it is not to live a virgin life he said like a man or a woman well that would have been one of the first things I went to wouldn't you but you know what we wouldn't a prophet and that gets the wrong idea you think it's something you could do or not do right come on church did you read those things how about it is not to be let me get over here to it page 141 a paragraph 141 attached to a perfect man 143 coming through now right there knocks a lot of us at virtue to your faith that doesn't just mean living a virgin life because we look up the word virtue and it goes to that and that's what we think it is look what he says you know like a woman or a man or so forth that doesn't have nothing to do with that what about a man making that statement then he goes on to describe virtue as what strength strength because Jesus had virtue now was he against living a virgin life no no no come on he was expressing that that wouldn't what it was because that's what we think it is we think it's just living a good virgin life well you can do a virtue Verte virgin life and not be virtuous at all there's plenty of women in this world that are virgins and mean is a rattlesnake now you tell me that ain't true there are virtuous in the point I mean not virtuous to the point of it being virtuous they're virgin to the point of just being natural virgin they don't want to do it but virtuous to be a virtuous Christian now there's no way you can have virtue unless God supplies it it's not something you can try to develop do or exercise or do what that's when he's saying it it's not to be a virgin it's not something you can do is something he has to do all right so he comes into us to make us a virtuous Christian now that word is correct it's in the stature of a perfect man that to be a virtuous Christian like I said you me a virgin be mean it's routs night but even you can be a virtuous Christian that's what God wants is someone who has his nature in his ways into us and it's not how good we are that's what we think it is we think it's how good we are is what the statue of perfect man no it's not it's how much word that has been given unto us because only by the revealing of the word can you be a virtuous Christian it's wonderful and good to be a virgin that's true but you can be mean and be a virgin you get it so he said it's not that away he said it's not just being a virgin so then the virtuous must mean something that's what he said what did it he said it means power or strength and see do you remember Jesus and he refers to it and Luke where the woman touched him and he said virtue has won out virtue has won out strength God strength virtue Lorenz said you got to have it and got to have a pice for it to go out through let's see that's your virtuous life that's the part that we do have to affect to doing with is the virtuous part of our lives that we live right he said it's not much virtue to be able to draw from you he said if you see you out here you know going to church doing good and then the next day out in the world in sin there's no virtue to that but it's not now listen to what I'm saying and don't get miss understanding it's not how strong you are it's not that that's not the virtuous party's talking about see Jesus was Almighty God and people touched him and he said virtue strength his body was drained brother Brennan would talk about it he talked about how praying for people you know hour after hour and he'd be so weak he couldn't stand that strength going out but remember you can also run a marathon you can run a race and get tired so it's not that form of strength don't get that line it's not to just say form of strength to the body no it's not that it's virtue going out from you to another person have you ever experienced if you've never experienced it to be hard to explain but I have prayed for people when it just the whole strength of your body is gone but then I prayed many a prayer that I never felt a thing I don't mind telling you the truth both ways but I've seen it strain the body to work that you'd just be so weak at this you couldn't even walk but yet I've run a race and do that so don't get too too fit to you know mixed up don't get the physical park get the spiritual part it's drawing from you the x-rays you know how they've done it to make them stop doing it because the x-rays would pull from one person to another one rays and going through your body you know what I'm talking about they used to have me stepped on him he had you feet you could look at them and in the hands you can lay them out under it and it would just show all of that well they made him quit what because it wasn't safe it was doing the wrong time but science proves that race goes from one person to another that's the kind of strength I'm talking about that's the kind of virtue I'm talking about if something in God that he gives to you it gives it to you because he had it but remember how he had the virtue he couldn't live like the devil and claim to be the Messiah right am i right you wouldn't him this you know his mouths running and said I'm the Messiah he lived the life of the Messiah and it went out to it you know yourself what I'm talking about that there's people that you like for to pray for you right there's people you like to pray you get them to pray for you because you can feel more of those things all right see because it's it's part of something you've got a confidence in that person for some reason has built a confidence around you or your thinking and you can draw from it and that's strength so virtue is not just being a virgin life that way it's a virtuous life it's a Christian life lived in God by him living it through you and that way other people can see Christ and and want to be like you right they want to be like you they want to live like you and actions like you what if they don't see Christ in us I've told you about it had a lady at work one time I had to work with these two women right real close all day long and day in and day out cuz of the jobs that we were running and one of them got upset one day and said something I said oh that's all right we all get upset you know like that I said don't worry about it we all get upset she said Sam said I've been around you for I forgot how many years and I've worked side-by-side he said I've never seen you under pressure they're all messed up did you always just calm and collective envy it well you know that's a good way to be that's what we should be man it worked on her ass Tom asked him one time you heard him tell about it he said on a scale from one to ten said what do you think of Sam Dale he said I think that 11 would be a start could you see we had been friends all of our life I mean all the time we'd work together you've heard me tell her what it was done because it's true I don't we had a big old Destin table of he and I work from but the Colleen owes him Luther back I'll never remember it but you know what was so funny the way he and I set burn talked and done you know what he had on one the end of that desk and all the Playboy magazines just racks of him you know what I had on the other end my Bible and spoken word boots not there side by side everybody died life and said we can't understand it started to preach her own one in Playboy other than when I didn't go I walk over and look all I wanted to find a problem but it wasn't nothing to me and I he he come to my defense because I was sitting in the office that he had brought me a magazine there on the pyramids the Playboy magazine had a pyramid on the front I always got to cap it telling a lot about the pyramids of Egypt because I was studying on them and this man comes up and looked over enough isn't a little cubicle office oh we caught the preacher he's looking at the Playboy magazine he's over here novice come on boys and this was a white guy and that black guy he just reached and got him he slammed him up against that office and he said you leave him alone he said I brought him the magazines that he's studying to preach from it the boy nobody never said another word nobody didn't argue about what was going on and I brought the magazine here and read from it why why can't we be the same all the time and I we're human we make mistakes we're all got our blow ups and outs and ends and how we're human beings we'll get to that when we get on over a little bit more to temperance what bless God I don't how no bad temper well what do you need temperance for if you don't have a bad temper all right let's see virtue the point of trying to get across to you what is virtue he's not to just live a virgin life that's that's fine that's well and good that's not the definition of the statue of a perfect man of growth development in Christianity through the Word of God to bring us to a place to understand virtue means the life of Christ right he had virtue and it went out from people saw him he didn't have to get up every day as we always say he not to get up every day you know and so I got an act like God so I guess I'm gonna be God I better act like him today no he went about his daily duties as a Christian that was his virtues was his life that's why that our lives are so valuable to the basis you know of being right and doing right we're human come on but that's no justification but it's the truth it's a truth that were to be virtuous or at least be to the point to where people can pull from us right now may I back up a little bit to the last message I preached on the fivefold ministry for a second to just say what the Prophet had to say about it brother Branham said if you won't take God's Word like I'm laying here if you want if you won't take God's Word he said he just sends you a fivefold ministry remember that in the other day if you won't take God's Word he said he just sends you a file full ministry you need it hey come on I tell ya I'm gonna tell you I got something you you better bank on the fact that I got it blind Bartimaeus and his word should be sufficient if you didn't believe my word I'd probably just let it go if I didn't believe yours you'd let me go with not God if you don't believe his word was then still he sends the holy spirit with gifts in the church what's the first apostles prophets evangelists teachers pastors all for the perfect in the church to bring the church to the knowledge of him about it as the eagle stirreth his nest God is a good he sends his word and I hope you listening he sends his word he has sent us his word right the Prophet brought the word alrighty you with me he sends his word if you won't believe his word then he puts in the church five different offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors event they are for the perfecting of the church what about it he sent his word you don't believe his word he sent a fivefold ministry remember the message now I hope it was proof enough for you to understand that the fivefold ministry is predestinated I went through that over and over and over if you didn't get that tape go back to it remember you'll have to go back to it on the the fact of it being on the yeah or you call it it ain't video it's audio because the power went off but its own are now cuz I listened to it today so you know don't say well it ain't honor out of it now it's on her that message is on that her there was just a couple little clips they brought up the thing we taped it and everything but remember the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints but now do we believe that now that was what the whole point of me re-emphasize Innova to begin with to try to get you to think about what is the statue of a perfect man what is the message of adoption to become partakers of his divine nature that we can live a Christian life and God can draw from that that strength can go out from you to others right Christian strength can go out from you there's a lot of people looking at you a lot of people looking at me and a lot of people trying to see each one of us and see what we are oh yeah we're human failures that's that's right but we're trying to be a Christian and walk in Christ that should be our desire and our thoughts for everything so it's not a virgin life that's not enough that's natural things that's something you could do or not do but a virtuous life is something you can't do it's a life in Christ the statue of a perfect man those disciples had virtue that virtue is a Christian life lived by the Word of God right it's the word lived by people you know people are looking at you trying to find Christ right I know I'll get up I get people upset at me because I go too far but is it true that maybe the reason your family doesn't want this word is because of the presentation that you made of this word that hurts don't it that drives a nail into all of our hearts maybe the reason your family is not in this message you might be you and your presentation of the message now see that's not virtue or virtuous oh you can be pure and holy and quiet I mean like a lily a beautiful and everything but what if we don't have a virtuous life to present to the world for them to be able to see Jesus Christ what about it have you ever really just apologized to your family ever apologize to your family we're going at it in the wrong way to try to win them to the Lord know bless God I was trying to win them to the Lord and I'm gonna stay with that okay what if that don't work what if the virtuous life is to live the life before them as an example and living that life as an example could win the people more than all of our great shoutings about what we've got when you shouldn't talk like that we're doing pretty good you got down meddling well alright but is it true is it true that maybe our families have not seen Christ in the way they should see him yes but brother Dale you can talk because all of your families in the message will I just made the point you killed your own self just now I didn't know it come on are you trying to break know how to break it still true what is the people around you think about you oh yeah they're all they got all of that videos oh that's just a bunch of fanatics being fanatical is one thing but being a Christian is another man there's a difference in fanatical and Christian you live a Christian life every day and they don't think you're fanatic but if you live in a Christian life and and they think in your fanatic you ain't gonna do it but when you make them think that of you we all have a problem yeah we all have troubles we all never days and ins and outs and up and down nobody said a word but we don't have to put that out there as the wrong thing to try to justify ourselves we just are what we are a virtuous Christian one who walks in God's Word did the disciples have any better days than we have that's my point of starting with in other words did they have real good days in real good huh no huh they were beaten imprisoned and malt and made fun of and all kind of things every day of their lives but as I asked you I wonder what they'd like to swap with us because here see we're facing all of these demons two hundred thousand thousand loosed on the bride of Jesus Christ somewhere there about in the 80s or something because that's where your prophet said he's 60 something he said 20 years later loosed on the bride but you know what it's far are we taking it as a Christian and being like Christ and saying whatever it takes you know what those demons are loosed on you and me far to drive us to the mess that's what's your profits then well why don't we take our down-and-outs as our joyously the fact of look what it's done it's drove us to the word then we might think about what I've tried to express the start with what is it to be a Christian what is it to be a statue of perfect man Christian well it's people that don't ever have no troubles will you miss Christianity by a longshot because according to my understanding they many of the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord lead us out of them all for my understanding to be a Christian is not going to set you aside to the place that you don't have no trouble it's gonna put you to place you're gonna have plenty of trouble right being a Christian is not an easy walk you know what I'm talking about it's a daily duty to be in a Christian but we walk in Christ what a wonderful thing then to be to realize he's paid to procced he's done all the other and all we got to do is do what he says and be automatically he didn't get up acting like Christ he was Christ he went about his daily duties being what he was that's what we're supposed to be be a Christian no matter where we're at and what we're doing you think about Christianity as a growth development of the Word of God as it's being revealed to us we started this journey with the Prophet in what we were talking about other statute of Purim and where he was saying over and over well how faith and be born again and then these are the things that he expects us to add add virtue well how can you add virtue do you realize what I've tried to say over and over if you believe it do you believe that brother Branham said this messenger of Malachi 4 will do two things turn the hearts of the children back to favor and open the thunders the do you believe that with you know what God has made away he didn't leave us without a way he's made a way for us to be able to receive what he's given us so that is not something we cannot attain Andrew well I'll change that we can't attain unto it I'll go the other way with I'll go with you on it cuz I know we can't attain unto a Christian life no but we can get in the way and hinder God's keeping him from getting it right in their own lives to be a Christian is to be christ-like living for others like a brother was preaching Sunday see living for others being for others a man there in the scripture you know what his name was wonderful because he he was his name feared what he was what about ours come on musicians what about it I'm just trying to get one point across because as we try to get this of the virtues you can't just read the virtue and say well we just read this and we know what it is no no no you're gonna have to read the virtues and let God show you what it is virtue is strength not physical strength but something that God has given unto you that others can see Christ and want to be locking right you remember when you first started to school come on every little boy in year the first day in school his school teacher was his girlfriend and I had one that when I finished the ninth grade she was still teaching so she is my 80 something-year-old girlfriend you know what I'm getting at you know what I'm saying they set something in front of you as a way or a point and establish in to you the right thoughts in the right way of being and that's where Christian is Christian you say well the Christian is a sinless now Christian is not a sinless person Christian is a forgiving person but he doesn't use his sin as a crutch he doesn't use it as a crutch to to or to condemn others or whatever he just walks as to what he's supposed to be that's what these children are looking at they're seeing you and watching you and me we we live in our lives before the people if they want to be like you we're coming around the road over the house one day Tarrance we'd been over to see something our neighbor and he said daddy he said I'm glad you didn't follow her after that feller so that feller was a long higher down to here you know and he pita and I said what do you mean he said well I'm just glad you didn't act like that and look like that I I said why he said with cold I might have wanted to look that way I said I don't like that so that's a good point you know maybe we need to be more different let Stan just trying to make a point because how could you preach about virtue you can only live it you can't preach it that will be the whole goal now of all of these knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness to see is my love part of life right go ahead brother what was it let's let's sing number 507 let let go and let God have his wonderful way God is wonderful way to say go God had his way your sorrow I turn to they just let go and let God is way if not us living the Christian life there is him living alive is wonderful the virtue of a statue I go and letting him lay out your life this way your sorrow - drawer I turn today steady and let God it's pretty man let go and my god it is wonderful way just let go let God whose way your sorrow will vanish you're no no let's go show you do fully ever have you for no less than these let's send these prayer calls believe that they'll have a safe trip turn back everything will be safe and all número thy alcove prayed with him yesterday about we've got a physical problem so just remember that okay father we thank you we asked you to just go now with these that are traveling Lord and give them a safe journey as they're going down back Lord just let your love and grace be with them and father we ask you them to reach down and touch brother aisle to remove this problem that's bothering because we believe your word and we thank you in Jesus name we believe it anybody else and let God is wonderful and let God [Music] that's what I mean that it's automatically yeah we just let go and let him live in the Christian life since to let Christ live in us that's Christian life not something I can do that's why I believe was that's what struck me when I years ago when I first read it it was so odd for brother Adam to be going declare virtue and what it isn't he said that's not to be a virgin [Music] now I need to read a little bit more what he's saying because he just told me if not what I thought it was because I could look up the word [Music] it's not looking at words it's a profit defining what a word means a virtuous life take on these things as weak or separately father we know tonight's been dried but yet it's meant for one time for us to see where we stand and what we need we don't need to try to manufacture something all we need to do is just let go and let you lens let you manifest yourself through us Lord and it's your virtue it's not mine anyways so just help us as we think about these things that we think about a growth development of in your word because that's what brains of your virtues to us is your word that's unveil to us we love in we thank you we were the people on the way home give everybody a safe journey let your loving grace be with us in Jesus name you just need [Music] our baby mice nope [Music]
