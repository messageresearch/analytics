[18:30] all that good singing and the specials
[18:32] and whatnot and uh we really love that
[18:36] it's our joy amen and but to hear the
[18:39] word is uh is uh just one of the
[18:43] greatest things the Privileges I think
[18:45] that we have in uh in this life so we'll
[18:48] just get right to the word this evening
[18:51] uh Revelations CH 3 verse 10 I want to
[18:53] take a scripture from there and then go
[18:55] back over to Matthew 5 and read a few
[18:57] verses there
[18:59] excuse me now I want to apologize in
[19:01] advance to you
[19:03] tonight because you may have noticed I I
[19:06] speak a little bit differently than
[19:08] brother Dale quicker I'm talking the
[19:10] pace I'm talking about and uh somebody
[19:13] asked me I was preaching somewhere years
[19:14] ago in down South Carolina somebody
[19:15] asked me said brother Jim you used to be
[19:16] an
[19:20] Auctioneer I think it was the same time
[19:22] they asked me is that was that my was
[19:23] that my real hair I know people just
[19:25] wonder I've even had people get
[19:27] distracted over a tie that I wor and I
[19:29] just couldn't I couldn't even focus cuz
[19:31] some tie you had on I thought well Lord
[19:32] have mercy I you know it's easy to get
[19:35] distracted sometimes you
[19:37] know and uh Satan will be sure to
[19:40] distract you you know one way or another
[19:42] and uh so if we can just uh press on and
[19:46] uh just uh devote our minds to be
[19:49] attentive that's right uh to the word uh
[19:52] no one ever was an Auctioneer but you
[19:53] know if the preaching thing didn't work
[19:54] out perhaps there was a
[19:57] be yeah but I'm not here because I
[20:00] called myself to be here I was heading
[20:03] entirely in a different direction I was
[20:04] my senior year of school heading to law
[20:06] school and and all of a sudden lord said
[20:09] no that ain't what I called you for the
[20:11] Apostle Paul he said I've called you
[20:13] I've set you for the defense of the
[20:14] gospel I've called you to the gospel so
[20:16] so that's exactly uh amen what we do as
[20:19] we as we Minister his word so uh I might
[20:23] uh get maybe a good clip so I'll just
[20:26] warn you just if I talk quick just
[20:27] listen right so if God give a man
[20:30] ability to speak quick he he obviously
[20:33] give us the ability to listen quick too
[20:35] one mouth and two ear so you got the
[20:36] advantage on me
[20:38] so uh we just cuz you get 10% of it see
[20:42] yeah 10% of a big thing is more than 10%
[20:44] of a little thing say that's just the
[20:46] way my mind works so so we just uh just
[20:50] wanting to put uh our minds uh in
[20:53] remembrance tonight of things that you
[20:55] know uh as Peter said we speak these
[20:58] things to you not because you don't know
[20:59] them because you do know them so that
[21:01] you might be established see the in the
[21:03] present truth that's amen Revelation 3
[21:06] verse
[21:07] 10 because thou has kept the word of my
[21:09] patience I also will keep thee from the
[21:12] hour of Temptation which shall come upon
[21:13] all the world to try them that dwell
[21:17] upon the Earth and then Matthew Chapter
[21:21] 5 beginning at verse
[21:25] 10 Matthew CH 5 and verse 10 11 and
[21:30] 12 blessed are they which are persecuted
[21:34] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[21:37] Kingdom of Heaven blessed are you when
[21:40] men shall revile you and persecute you
[21:44] and shall say all manner of evil against
[21:46] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[21:50] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[21:53] in heaven for so persecuted they the
[21:56] prophets which were before you tonight
[22:00] for my subject I want to just take uh
[22:04] the thought of the value of persecution
[22:06] am the value of persecution could you
[22:08] bow your heads with me just in a word of
[22:11] prayer kind and gracious Heavenly Father
[22:14] we present ourselves to you this evening
[22:16] Lord with no abilities of our own that
[22:18] we choose to use Lord but we surrender
[22:20] oursel now uh speaker not only speaker
[22:23] but hearer as well father may we hear
[22:27] with the hearing ear that the Lord hath
[22:29] given in the Seeing Eye father you said
[22:31] the entrance of your words would give
[22:33] light and give understanding to the
[22:36] simple father may that be our portion
[22:37] tonight David said again light is swn
[22:40] for the righteous and gladness for the
[22:42] upright in heart speak to us tonight
[22:44] speak to the hearts of your people
[22:46] tonight father weave this word as it
[22:49] comes
[22:49] forth uh the truth Lord into the fabric
[22:52] of our souls Lord give us strength to
[22:54] stand in this evil age G us up with
[22:58] strength and Truth tonight father we'll
[23:00] bless your name for it give you the
[23:01] honor and the glory in the name of the
[23:03] Lord Jesus Christ and all of God's
[23:05] people said amen amen God bless you may
[23:08] return to the comfort of your
[23:11] seat the verses that I have read from
[23:14] Matthew's gospel tonight are taken from
[23:17] the notable Sermon on the Mount which
[23:20] begins with the the attitudes uh to this
[23:24] point uh he is spoken about the poor in
[23:26] spirit he's talking about they that
[23:27] mourn he's talked about the meek he's
[23:29] talked about they that hunger and thirst
[23:31] after righteousness he's talked about
[23:33] the merciful he's talked about the pure
[23:34] in heart right he's talked about the
[23:36] peacemakers and lastly he speaks about
[23:39] the persecuted right and what Jesus is
[23:41] doing he's first stating the condition
[23:45] that the believer needs to find himself
[23:48] in then he States the promise right in
[23:50] other words the meek what shall inherit
[23:51] the earth the merciful shall obtain
[23:54] Mercy the pure in heart they shall see
[23:56] God and so forth and he goes down
[23:58] through now excuse me a casual study of
[24:01] these Beatitudes will reveal that they
[24:04] contain a valuable lesson even for the
[24:06] Believers in this hour that's right and
[24:08] that's why I want to take this eth
[24:10] beatitude uh and look at some of the
[24:12] ramification of these verses as they
[24:15] relate to us the bride in this hour now
[24:18] in this beatitude Jesus in verse 10 he
[24:22] appears to be speaking uh of persecution
[24:24] on a personal level and through his
[24:27] teaching here he makes known to us that
[24:29] although it involves pain and suffering
[24:32] that it's really a normal part of
[24:35] discipleship uh just as being merciful
[24:38] or Meek or a peacemaker any of the
[24:40] others matter of fact on page 84 of the
[24:43] church 82 of the church H book brother
[24:45] man made this statement he said
[24:46] persecution and trials are a natural
[24:50] normal part of the Christian Life he
[24:53] said there's only one thing you can do
[24:54] about them commit them all to God judge
[24:56] not and leave their outworking and final
[24:59] judgment to him and so we've got some
[25:02] very practical advice that he's given us
[25:05] here now
[25:06] persecution still is not one of those
[25:09] things that we enjoy all right or that
[25:11] we particularly look forward to amen
[25:13] right but it's something we know that we
[25:15] need but in the flesh yeah you know I
[25:19] really don't want it but according to
[25:21] the prophet he said it's natural and
[25:23] it's normal so God's Got A Reason in it
[25:25] God's got a purpose in it and there is
[25:27] an end result that will result from that
[25:31] okay now to get us started tonight I
[25:33] want to remind you of several things the
[25:35] scripture says about persecution number
[25:37] one Jesus said it's a given it's a given
[25:39] persecution is in other words you can
[25:42] expect persecution it's not just kind of
[25:44] optional maybe it will maybe it won't no
[25:47] believer is exempt from persecution I
[25:50] said it last night the reality of our
[25:52] faith brother sister is this is it
[25:54] invites persecution just the very stand
[25:57] that you take right Jesus in John 16:33
[26:00] made this statement he said these things
[26:02] have I spoken to you that in me you
[26:04] might have peace in the world you shall
[26:07] have tribulation Affliction trouble
[26:09] anger anguish persecution but be of good
[26:12] cheer cuz I have overcome the world now
[26:15] we know brother bam said we're not going
[26:16] to go through the tribulation period
[26:18] it's not for the bride is that right cuz
[26:20] he's redeemed us unto himself and
[26:21] doesn't take a bride through the
[26:23] tribulation period but you will and you
[26:26] do have tribulation in life you have
[26:28] persecution right so we learned then
[26:31] that persecution is not only a giving a
[26:34] giving but Jesus said it's a blessing
[26:35] that's right amen a blessing he said
[26:37] it's a blessing Matthew 5 and: 10
[26:39] blessed are they that are persecuted the
[26:43] third thing we learned he said it brings
[26:45] exceeding gladness now these are things
[26:47] believe it or not I'm reading these
[26:48] things right out of your
[26:49] Bible not really the way we perceive but
[26:52] see it's it's all about looking not
[26:54] through the not through the natural man
[26:56] the carnal life you know but but but
[26:58] looking through the eyes of the Lord
[26:59] Paul said Philippians 2:5 he said put on
[27:01] the mind of Christ so I want to think
[27:03] now through his through his mind so we
[27:05] know it's a given we know it's a
[27:06] blessing and it brings exceeding
[27:09] gladness Matthew 5:12 rejoice and be
[27:12] exceeding glad somebody say exceeding
[27:15] gladed glad for for great is your reward
[27:19] in heaven for so persecuted they the
[27:21] prophets which before you right remember
[27:23] again over to Acts chapter 5 when the H
[27:25] when the Sanhedrin called to the
[27:26] apostles and they they forbid them to
[27:28] preach and they beat them they told them
[27:30] in Matthew I'm sorry acts 5:40 they
[27:32] commanded that they should not speak in
[27:34] jesus' name and they let them go verse
[27:36] 41 said they departed from the presence
[27:38] of the council
[27:40] rejoicing why that they were counted
[27:43] worthy to suffer shame for his name amen
[27:47] Rejoice praise God thank you Lord thank
[27:50] you Lord that I was Li thank you Lord
[27:52] that I that was was done wrong or
[27:54] mistreated or what not thank you Lord
[27:57] for that
[27:58] now the word rejoicing actually means to
[28:00] be glad or cheerful or joyful so so
[28:03] persecution I think like this
[28:04] persecution is a cause or an occasion
[28:08] for Joy are you with me and it's and of
[28:11] course uh again from verse 5 or chapter
[28:14] 5: 10 he says because of me so it is the
[28:18] cause uh Jesus is the cause of our
[28:21] persecution because of me so when we're
[28:23] taking sides with Jesus we'll experience
[28:26] what Jesus told us in John 15 and 20 he
[28:29] said if they persecuted me they will
[28:32] persecute you also Matthew 5:11 from my
[28:35] sake or because of me right so
[28:38] persecution will come because of the
[28:39] stand I take with the word made flesh am
[28:43] all right now if you to take a more
[28:45] thorough study of persecution in the
[28:46] Bible you'd find that it's actually
[28:48] revealed in a number of forms different
[28:50] ways that were persecuted According To
[28:53] Jesus and I'm just going down through
[28:54] very quickly because it's really not in
[28:55] my sermon but just kind of a little
[28:57] Foundation work according to the
[28:58] scripture Luke 6:22 we we can be
[29:01] persecuted verbally right uh we can be
[29:03] persecuted physically and the word
[29:05] persecute there uh it it means actually
[29:08] to chase away or pursue with hostile
[29:11] intent it literally means to be hunted
[29:13] down like an animal that sounds kind of
[29:16] familiar doesn't it remember the
[29:17] statement brother bam made and taking
[29:18] sides with Jesus he said during the
[29:20] tribulation period he said there will be
[29:22] the sleeping virgin will be hunted down
[29:24] by the dragon he said uh they'll search
[29:27] down take this woman remember her seat
[29:28] and we'll kill her right now that'll be
[29:30] in the tribulation period he said but
[29:31] the church will go home and questions
[29:33] and answers in the book of Hebrews he
[29:35] said the co- formal church is hunted
[29:38] down like dogs by the communist and
[29:39] Roman parties and when they're hunted
[29:41] down and killed he said they are are
[29:43] killed now yeah I want you to hold that
[29:45] thought in your minds just a little bit
[29:48] because in a few minutes I want to
[29:49] elaborate on just why they're hunted
[29:50] down you ever thought about that you say
[29:52] well I know why are they right why are
[29:54] they this is America this is the land of
[29:56] the free the home of the brave that's
[29:58] not some Socialist Party Russian but on
[30:03] American so we're talking about
[30:04] something happens here right and then
[30:07] and then he also talks about false
[30:09] accusations which come in a form of
[30:11] persecution uh blessed are you and men
[30:14] revile you and say all manner of evil
[30:15] against you for my sake brother mam said
[30:17] in the message speak to this rock in
[30:19] Jonesboro Arkansas if they call the
[30:21] Master of the House be Els up how much
[30:23] more will they call you that's right but
[30:25] blessed are you when you are
[30:27] for righteousness so this brother and
[30:30] sister we can expect as we serve the
[30:33] Lord amen because we know God has a
[30:35] purpose in allowing us to be be
[30:37] persecuted now again according to the
[30:39] scriptures persecution is used to help
[30:41] us develop a greater dependence upon the
[30:43] Lord second Corinthians 12:10 uh Paul
[30:46] said I take pleasure in infirmities Paul
[30:49] are you crazy right Paul understood
[30:52] something that we we've got to come to a
[30:54] like understand I take pleasure in
[30:57] infirmities in reproaches in Necessities
[31:00] in persecu and we get to this point
[31:02] we're up here praying oh God God help me
[31:04] preacher pray for me with all Paul said
[31:07] I take pleasure in it you need to go
[31:08] back to your seat and say thank you Lord
[31:10] for all this we say Lord take it away
[31:13] from I mean Paul said you ought to
[31:14] rejoice and thankful Lord
[31:17] for Paul says in distresses and
[31:20] persecutions and infirmities and
[31:22] reproaches and he said he said in
[31:25] distresses for the Lord's sake for when
[31:26] I'm weak that I'm strong most gladly
[31:29] therefore will I rather glory in my
[31:31] infirmities that the power of Christ
[31:33] here it is now that the power of Christ
[31:35] May rest upon because power apart from
[31:38] character is what all right now it also
[31:41] cultivates righteousness and character 1
[31:44] Peter 5:10 Al ultimately it'll qualify
[31:47] your you for your ultimate reward which
[31:49] is what which is heaven verse 10 for
[31:52] theirs is the kingdom of heaven so I
[31:54] think from this little capsule synopsis
[31:57] of personal persecution you can see that
[31:59] God places a great value right on
[32:02] persecution talking about the value of
[32:05] persecution now all of this that I've
[32:08] said it speaks of persecution that we
[32:11] experience as Believers and it certainly
[32:13] is a natural and normal part of the
[32:15] Christian Life and we truly must commit
[32:18] them to God and judge not and leave
[32:20] their outworking and final judgment to
[32:21] him now I think when we're done tonight
[32:24] brother sister we'll see the profound
[32:28] of that very simple stat right now I
[32:30] want to dig a Little Deeper tonight into
[32:31] the subject of persecution and more
[32:34] specifically a dispensational
[32:36] persecution that is to try the elect of
[32:40] God right in the mark of the beast in
[32:42] 1954 brother B says now in the last days
[32:45] there's coming a persecution right he
[32:48] didn't say just persecution didn't say a
[32:50] p uh or little persecution or some
[32:53] persecution he said a singular
[32:56] persecution right in the message Jezebel
[32:59] religion Middletown Ohio 1961 he said
[33:02] there there there will come a
[33:05] persecution yeah he says the Bible says
[33:08] so so he's getting this from the
[33:09] scripture right he goes thus sayth the
[33:13] Lord certainly there will be will be
[33:16] what a persecution thus saith the Lord
[33:20] now in the message out
[33:22] denomination on on uh 1958 brother bam
[33:26] says now he said now you just mark it
[33:28] down take your pens out your paper Mark
[33:30] in the FL he said you mark this down
[33:32] it's not everything he said Mark down
[33:34] but when he tells us to Mark something
[33:35] down then it's it's indelibly inscribed
[33:38] there the fly leaf of our Bible it's
[33:40] something we can go back and read over
[33:41] and over and over and over you don't
[33:42] want to forget this right he said Mark
[33:44] this down jot this down he said uh he
[33:48] said you just got to mark it down you
[33:50] got to mark it down he said we we now
[33:53] the elect the bride the church we are
[33:56] coming to a religious persecution right
[33:59] he said we are coming to that he said
[34:03] with the same things now watch the same
[34:06] things that they did in Pagan Rome many
[34:10] years ago for it's thus saith the Lord
[34:15] now you think Titus here think
[34:16] Constantine here think of the murder of
[34:18] the 68 million Christians here he goes
[34:22] what is it he said setting upon a beast
[34:24] a power now watch this as we to build
[34:27] this so the prophet is telling us here
[34:29] brother and sister that there will be a
[34:32] time prior to the tribulation period uh
[34:36] which would be a time an era if you will
[34:40] of satanic rule where Satan will set up
[34:43] his Eden and he'll be crowned as the God
[34:46] of this age I think that's where we are
[34:49] commenting on this brother bam said it
[34:51] will be so
[34:53] right so
[34:55] enlightening and and lifegiving amen
[34:58] that it'll fool the world oh in other
[35:01] words only the elect now right only this
[35:04] one in the million is not going to be
[35:06] fooled by this that he's talking about
[35:08] here tonight right amen now you know why
[35:12] we're not going to be fooled with
[35:13] because God so greatly loves his bride
[35:16] that he's given us now a clear
[35:19] understanding and a correct knowledge of
[35:22] what's going to take place very soon now
[35:25] on American soul before we're translated
[35:28] amen Isaiah 33 and5 Isaiah prophesied
[35:32] said the Lord is exalted for he dwelleth
[35:35] on high he hath filled Zion how many
[35:38] knows who Zion is it's the bride he has
[35:41] filled Zion with judgment and
[35:45] righteousness all right so what he's
[35:47] promised to do fill our hearts with
[35:49] judgment and righteousness all right so
[35:52] she's the bride what's God done with her
[35:54] in this hour filled her with judgment
[35:55] and righteousness what is righteousness
[35:58] on paragraph 161 of the message it be
[36:01] behooveth us to fulfill all
[36:03] righteousness brother mam said of course
[36:05] righteousness is his word he's filled us
[36:08] with judgment he's filling us with the
[36:10] word is that right Isaiah 33 and six
[36:13] said and wisdom and knowledge shall be
[36:16] the stability of thy times amen what's
[36:19] going to what's going to be the
[36:20] stability of our times wisdom and
[36:23] knowledge not emotion and feelings and
[36:25] Sensations running the a and bubble
[36:27] dancing and jumping the that's all fine
[36:29] and dendy right but you're not going to
[36:31] get established with with that he said
[36:34] wisdom and knowledge is what will
[36:36] stabilize you in this hour Proverbs 4:7
[36:39] the wise man wrote Solomon said wisdom
[36:42] is the principal thing therefore get
[36:45] wisdom and with all thy getting get
[36:48] understanding well how am I going to get
[36:50] this understanding how do I get this
[36:52] understanding well Jeremiah 3:15 he said
[36:55] I will give you pastors
[36:57] amen come on huh according to my heart
[37:00] God says I'm going to choose the pastors
[37:02] we talk about the ministry today he says
[37:04] he says I'll give you pastors according
[37:06] to mine heart and they shall feed you
[37:09] with wisdom and understanding that's why
[37:12] your pastor Labor Service in service out
[37:15] Amen to go into that golden pot filled
[37:17] with Mana to bring it to the children of
[37:19] God because he's feeding you with
[37:21] something he's feeding you with wisdom
[37:23] he's feeding you with knowledge amen
[37:25] amen so what what's he saying so I've
[37:28] got to get this understanding well if
[37:30] you'll if you'll be at your post of Duty
[37:32] if you'll be at the house of God when
[37:33] the door is open you'll be able to
[37:35] you'll be able to feed from this wisdom
[37:37] and understanding that your pastor has
[37:39] labored to bring you come on say Amen
[37:42] all right
[37:48] now the scripture said second second
[37:52] Thessalonians chapter 2 Paul speaks of
[37:54] an end time apostasy a falling away
[37:57] second Timothy 3 states for perilous
[37:58] times shall come stressful times
[38:00] difficult times times difficult to cope
[38:03] with second Timothy 4 tells us there'll
[38:05] be a time where people will not even
[38:06] endure sound Doctrine but they'll Heap
[38:08] to themselves teachers having itching
[38:09] ears right right 1 Timothy 4:1 the
[38:12] spirit speaks expressly that means he's
[38:14] prophesying that in the latter days many
[38:16] will depart from the faith giving heed
[38:18] to seducing Spirits deceiving spirits
[38:21] and doctrines of devils speaking lies
[38:24] and hypocrisy having their conscience
[38:25] seared with the hot iron that's the
[38:28] entire condition that's before us here
[38:30] that's right so these would be just a
[38:32] few of the many scriptures that revealed
[38:34] to us that the bride would be warned and
[38:37] would indeed be made aware that there is
[38:40] to come upon this world what John
[38:42] referred to in Revelation 3:10 as the
[38:45] hour of Temptation we read it earlier
[38:48] that brother Adam said would preced the
[38:50] Rapture and the Earth then would enter
[38:52] into a time in which the powers of
[38:55] darkness and the withdrawing of the Holy
[38:57] Spirit would together create an
[39:00] atmosphere of Temptation and deception
[39:03] that would be so great that except for
[39:06] the grace of God to a small elected
[39:08] group there'd be none on the earth who'd
[39:11] be able to withstand right don't think
[39:13] brother sister for one what I don't care
[39:15] how long you've been in the message I
[39:16] don't care how much you know or don't
[39:18] know don't think for one minute that you
[39:20] or I could alone stand the temptation of
[39:22] this
[39:24] house in the message Israel brother Adam
[39:27] said watch it's moving right out today
[39:28] in a terrible force all around it
[39:31] behooves you my brother sister to
[39:33] consider what you're listening at Jesus
[39:36] said be careful how you hear didn't he
[39:38] say brother man said and don't you never
[39:40] underestimate Satan's power for
[39:42] deceiving don't you ever underestimating
[39:46] for he's as smooth as he can be that's
[39:50] right so the Bible tells us that in this
[39:52] hour that all would be deceived the
[39:55] whole Earth all but just the very elect
[39:59] and that's only because God has decreed
[40:00] it to be so right so he gives us a
[40:03] special provision a special
[40:06] Enlightenment an anointing if you will
[40:09] to carry us to preserve us through this
[40:12] time Glory but the rest of the world
[40:15] totally succumbs to the hour of
[40:17] Temptation in other words no one
[40:20] withstands it outside of the
[40:22] predestination now I'm talking about an
[40:24] oncoming persecution tonight but before
[40:28] I get into the particulars of it let me
[40:30] remind you of what the prophet of God
[40:32] said that brings it on now on page 312
[40:36] of the church age book in the
[40:37] Philadelphian age brother bam actually
[40:39] quotes he's reading Revelations 3:10
[40:41] because I was kept the word of my
[40:43] patience I'll keep you from the hour of
[40:45] Temptation which will come upon the
[40:46] world to try them upon the earth now two
[40:48] words two words I want to Define for you
[40:51] the first is Temptation the hour of
[40:53] Temptation the word is in a greater a
[40:55] better translation would would have been
[40:56] trial or proving in the Greek it speaks
[40:59] of a man's of the trial of a man's
[41:02] Fidelity or his Integrity or his virtue
[41:05] or his endurance Jesus has formerly said
[41:09] they that endure to the end the same
[41:11] shall be saved the message version
[41:13] translation in verse 10 says I'll keep
[41:16] you safe in the time of testing that
[41:20] will be here soon right now the next
[41:23] word is the word try it's coming on all
[41:26] the world to try them that dwell upon
[41:29] the Earth amen all right now try simply
[41:32] means to test for the purpose of
[41:35] ascertaining its quality or what he
[41:38] thinks or how he'll behave himself so
[41:41] what's God looking for when he brings a
[41:43] test to see how you will behave yourself
[41:47] then brother mam say the best thing God
[41:48] could ever do for you is bring you a
[41:50] test to give you a test because he wants
[41:53] to ascertain your maturity where where
[41:56] you're at how you'll react and so forth
[41:58] by Said by our faith he says how he said
[42:01] is our faith and our choices he said
[42:03] reflects the decisions and the choices
[42:06] that we make he said reflects our faith
[42:08] to God our Revelation you make choices
[42:11] you're presented with with decisions and
[42:13] all of these God requires us to make uh
[42:17] according to the word he said reflects
[42:18] our faith uh I believe to God so the
[42:21] trial then is to ascertain from us how
[42:26] we'll behave what we think it means to
[42:28] test our faith our virtal or character
[42:30] by enticement to
[42:32] sin it means to afflict e evils upon one
[42:37] in order to prove his character and the
[42:40] steadfastness of his faith right to
[42:43] challenge him as it were to give proof
[42:46] to his Perfections amen not his
[42:49] imperfections but his Perfection
[42:52] remember what we're talking about last
[42:53] night being made perfect all right so
[42:56] then the persecution comes to give proof
[42:59] to your Perfections all right so
[43:03] now now we're in the process being made
[43:06] perfect spiritual just men made perfect
[43:08] so forth now the characters being molded
[43:10] in our adoption placing and so forth
[43:12] then the find any words it's like we're
[43:14] in a classroom right yeah but then
[43:15] there's a test coming see always at the
[43:17] end of the class you got a test coming
[43:19] oh yeah see it's not really how much but
[43:21] it's when you get down to the test how
[43:22] much of it really has become has you
[43:25] know just metabolized into the into the
[43:27] Christian experience right so we've got
[43:30] to understand then that this hour of
[43:31] Temptation when it comes will be the the
[43:34] final test brother bam been talking
[43:36] about Abraham and possessing the enemy's
[43:38] Gates remember what he said he said and
[43:41] God Time After Time tested him Abraham
[43:43] now right he said but then he'd come to
[43:45] that final test before the blessing was
[43:48] going to happen right and that's the way
[43:50] it is with all the Seed of Abraham God
[43:53] gives us that final test just before
[43:56] before he gives the promise all right
[43:59] now in the in the in the church book
[44:02] page
[44:04] 313 uh brother bam said for This Promise
[44:07] talking about the hour of Temptation has
[44:09] to do with the end time I'm sorry with
[44:12] the end of the Gentile period yeah you
[44:14] talking about now this our Temptation
[44:17] This that's come upon all the world a
[44:18] trial all that's on the world y he said
[44:20] has to do with the end time the end of
[44:22] the Gentile period which culminates in
[44:25] the tribulation period he guys placing
[44:28] that right see it's it's not speaking of
[44:30] the tribulation period but it will
[44:32] terminate or it will climaxed or it will
[44:35] conclude in the tribulation period you
[44:37] see that now amen so it will begin now
[44:41] before the tribulation period a short
[44:43] little space the hour of trial hour and
[44:45] then it will accumulate or it will
[44:47] culminate it will end and then the rest
[44:49] will go into the tribulation period all
[44:51] right you see that right now now it
[44:54] begins to explain the verse paragraph 2
[44:56] page 312 I'll keep you from the hour of
[44:59] Temptation which will come upon all the
[45:00] world try them that dwell upon the Earth
[45:02] he said this is not a declaration that
[45:05] the true church will go into and through
[45:07] the tribulation if it meant that it
[45:08] would have said that but it said I'll
[45:10] keep you from right the AR Temptation he
[45:12] said the Temptation is exactly like the
[45:15] Temptation in Eden it'll be a very
[45:18] inviting proposition held up in direct
[45:23] opposition yeah to God's commanded word
[45:26] and yet from the standpoint of human
[45:28] reasoning see that's why Paul in Hebrews
[45:31] uh Romans chapter 8 he talks about you
[45:33] know walking in the faith walking in the
[45:35] walking in the spirit Walking In the
[45:36] Flesh walking as a caral man walking as
[45:38] a spiritual man and Paul said if you
[45:40] continue to be Carly minded he said
[45:41] you're going to die because the carnal
[45:43] minded man who's going to use human
[45:45] reasoning is going to look at this thing
[45:47] as so enlightening so lifegiving he said
[45:50] to fool all but the very elect but it
[45:53] will be presented in stark contrast and
[45:56] in direct opposition to the word of God
[45:58] that we received through a prophet and
[46:00] that's why brother man said you better
[46:02] mark this down and take heed to these
[46:04] things that he's he's warning us of so
[46:06] he said from the standpoint of human
[46:08] reasoning which has always been the
[46:10] enemy of Faith right it'll be so right
[46:12] so enlightened give life giv to fool the
[46:14] world on the ver like not be full of
[46:15] Temptation will come as follows the
[46:17] acumenical move that has started on what
[46:20] seems such a beautiful and blessed
[46:22] principle fulfilling Christ's prayer
[46:24] that we all might be one becomes so
[46:27] strong politically that she Bears
[46:30] pressure on the government to cause all
[46:34] to join with her either directly or
[46:36] through adherence to principles enacted
[46:39] into law so that no people will be
[46:42] recognized as actual churches unless
[46:45] under direct or indirect domination of
[46:49] this Council now I'm will come back to
[46:51] this statement here in just a
[46:53] minute uh but I want to add this since
[46:56] World War II the world has been
[46:59] preparing for a one world government did
[47:01] you know that it started with with an
[47:03] organization called the League of
[47:04] Nations it name has now been changed to
[47:07] the UN of the United Nations let me just
[47:09] read a statement to you on page 320 of
[47:11] the church H book brother mam said when
[47:14] the Ancients called leosia the
[47:16] Metropolis it was looking forward to the
[47:19] One World Government that we are now
[47:22] setting up right there's a prophet of
[47:24] God now here's a Watchman on the wall
[47:26] he's called up to look over to another
[47:28] oh I see what said he comes back and he
[47:30] tells us now he said this one world
[47:32] government he said which is now being
[47:35] set up as we think of that City being
[47:37] the location of the great church Council
[47:39] we see foreshadowed the E commical move
[47:41] taking place today wherein very soon we
[47:46] will see something we're going to see we
[47:48] will see all the so-called Christians
[47:51] come together indeed the church in the
[47:53] state religion and politics are all
[47:56] coming together the tears are being
[47:58] bound the weed will soon be ready for
[48:00] the G now it's pretty plain to see that
[48:04] the goal of this organization has been
[48:06] to rule the world right and now it's
[48:08] come to pass that Any Nation large or
[48:10] small who does not abide by their rules
[48:13] has got to pay the penalty now we've not
[48:16] been too concerned about this powerful
[48:18] un ruling over other nations but we're
[48:21] fast approaching a time where our
[48:23] country America herself will soon feel
[48:26] the brunt force and the influence of its
[48:28] power amen because the US who's backed
[48:31] by this powerful un force will soon be
[48:34] engaged in enforcing the mark of the
[48:36] beast on America's own soil but before
[48:40] this happens now the economy has to
[48:42] collapse America has to go bankrupt the
[48:45] dollar will have to die and the US debt
[48:48] will spiral so much out of control
[48:50] there'll be absolutely no way to pay it
[48:52] off right amen now I got a number AR at
[48:55] home in my study to show that's exactly
[48:58] what we're just on the road to that now
[48:59] we're just right at the place now so the
[49:02] bubble is about to burst brother sister
[49:04] the stage is certainly set now for this
[49:06] one world government to take over
[49:08] now brother bam made it very clear from
[49:11] the scriptures Revelation 13
[49:14] 11-17 the lamb nation that became a
[49:18] dragon is none other he said in the
[49:19] United States and he the US had power to
[49:22] give life into the image of the Beast
[49:24] that the image of the Beast should most
[49:25] speak and cause as many as would not
[49:27] worship the image should be killed right
[49:29] then in mark of the beast brother bam in
[49:31] referring to the above scripture said
[49:33] that's the
[49:35] boycott know you know these things right
[49:37] it's from about this time in 1954
[49:41] brother began brother Brandon began to
[49:42] field questions on the mark of the beast
[49:44] yeah and he always directed The Listener
[49:47] to a religious boycott that was soon to
[49:50] come remember that let me read to you a
[49:53] statement in questions and answers image
[49:55] of the beast in 1954 he said somebody
[49:58] asked me today two or three times I've
[50:00] been asked it brother man speaking on
[50:02] the mark of the beast don't you believe
[50:03] they'll tattoo a number in your head or
[50:05] tattoo something in your hand he said no
[50:07] sir don't never look at that it'll be a
[50:09] boycott certainly no man could buy s
[50:11] unless he belongs to the confederation
[50:13] of churches that's true it'll come like
[50:15] a union unionizing the thing bringing it
[50:19] down unionized religion mark my word it
[50:23] ain't far off and you'll see it
[50:26] it's just around the corner all right so
[50:28] he says before it's all said and done
[50:30] now we're going to see this unionizing
[50:33] of religion all right that what he said
[50:35] now in the tharan church age in
[50:39] 1960 in the in the Revelation Jesus
[50:41] Christ series he says now we believe the
[50:43] hour is close at hand now father when
[50:46] these churches is confederating
[50:48] themselves together making an image to
[50:50] the Beast and it'll be terrible on that
[50:53] group Lord that won't won't join it
[50:56] right now we're bringing the bride into
[50:58] Focus now don't be terrible on that
[51:00] group that won't join it the very boyot
[51:03] will come but in that hour you promise
[51:06] to take your church but now now watch
[51:08] here watch the the sequence now he goes
[51:10] help us Lord so he's telling us now that
[51:12] America who's a leader of the UN will
[51:15] very soon force a union of churches and
[51:18] everybody outside this church is going
[51:20] to be persecuted many is even going to
[51:22] be killed now listen to what he said in
[51:24] the message position position of in
[51:26] Christ are you listening amen now listen
[51:28] to this he says in
[51:30] 1960 in Jeffersonville he says 1500
[51:34] years of pagan persecution when they
[51:37] forced everybody and killed them
[51:39] murdered them strung them up put an ox
[51:42] on one hand and an ox on the other hand
[51:45] and made him either kiss the crucifix or
[51:47] start them oxes out one this way and how
[51:49] many knows what's going to happen my arm
[51:52] is tied to an ox on either end and I
[51:54] refuse to kiss the cross yeah
[51:55] something's going to give way thatx is
[51:58] probably a little bit stronger you know
[52:00] something's going to split in two right
[52:02] and it ain't going to be the ox right so
[52:05] he said he said that's the way they used
[52:06] to do that so they made business back
[52:08] then didn't they right and uh and
[52:10] brother bam says I put my hand right in
[52:13] Switzerland behind the post where they
[52:15] stood there and cut their tongues out
[52:17] and called them witches and everything
[52:18] else he said that's exactly right right
[52:20] and we'd go wow more I'm glad I'm living
[52:22] in this Earth yeah brother B said very
[52:24] next paragraph he says and that Same
[52:25] Spirit exists today that's right brother
[52:28] amen
[52:30] exactly he said it's just the law that
[52:32] holds it
[52:33] down just a law on It come on just just
[52:36] a law now that holds it down can't do it
[52:38] why can't do it now why there's a law
[52:40] against it he says but wait till it gets
[52:42] its freedom oh my God what it gets it
[52:45] fre that Spirit right what happens when
[52:46] that law is repealed or that law is
[52:49] deactivated what happens then he said
[52:51] just wait till the spirit gets you mean
[52:52] that Spirit going to get his freedom he
[52:54] said yeah you just wait till it does
[52:55] right prophet of God's tapped into
[52:56] something he's seeing something now he
[52:58] said the Bible said so just wait till it
[53:01] shows its colors it gets a chance to you
[53:05] might vote it in pretty soon for all I
[53:07] know oh my now we know that you can't
[53:10] just vote in a law per se right you
[53:13] can't just vote in a law well I like
[53:14] that law let's just vote it in I going
[53:16] go that the way you work but you can
[53:18] vote in a man that will sign that house
[53:21] resolution into
[53:22] law now my personal opinion is that
[53:25] we've already done that right already
[53:27] done that and I'll get to it in just a
[53:29] few minutes all right you still with me
[53:30] am so he says wait till it gets his
[53:34] freedom that spirit so one day it will
[53:37] he said the Bible said so so again he's
[53:38] seeing this in scripture he said just
[53:41] way that shows its colors you might vote
[53:43] in pretty soon for all I know it'll come
[53:45] there's no way of keeping it out it's
[53:49] got to come that's right it's got to
[53:51] come it's coming and when it does you
[53:54] just watch right well I guarantee you
[53:56] I'll be
[53:57] watching that ain't something's got to
[53:58] slap me in the face I ain't got a
[54:00] revelation that I'll see that we'll see
[54:03] that but so it's something he said he
[54:04] said now watch it now he just watch
[54:07] that but brother he said you want to
[54:09] know this one thing I know whom I have
[54:12] believed amen watching right on he said
[54:15] that's it spoken words we asual see uh
[54:19] paragraph 85 he said now that's the way
[54:20] it'll wind up it'll be a union a boycott
[54:23] all such places as this here will be
[54:26] closed down and you'll not be able to
[54:28] speak unless you got permission or a
[54:30] license from this Federation of churches
[54:33] to hold a service so that'll be an
[54:35] option that brother Dale and I at some
[54:37] point will have well I know I know what
[54:39] my decision is going to be and I think I
[54:40] know what decision your pastor is going
[54:42] to make also on that he's had a very
[54:45] difficult time now that's coming but
[54:46] watch here how many those God got a
[54:48] purpose in this to take place it's the
[54:50] test is coming the final test now many
[54:53] years ago actually in the third Century
[54:55] you realize there was an office that
[54:57] emerged was created uh in the world that
[55:00] office was the pope of Rome from which a
[55:03] man has come brother M call him Satan
[55:06] Superman uh he's been accepted by most
[55:08] of the world as their spiritual leader
[55:10] their father in The Gospel why the
[55:12] greatest names in Protestant America
[55:14] have declared him to be the moral leader
[55:17] of the West well knowing this and
[55:19] knowing that these same spiritual
[55:21] leaders are now controlling our
[55:23] government through the voting hes we can
[55:25] see how America's soon going to be
[55:27] exercising all the power that the Beast
[55:30] had before which Beast was wrome now how
[55:34] many knows that the goal of Rome has
[55:36] always been to rule the world through
[55:38] the church and how many remembers
[55:40] brother bam telling us in Satan's Eden
[55:42] that he's had marvelous success in
[55:45] carrying out every threat that he's made
[55:47] against the church marvelous success now
[55:52] let's just take a few minutes and look
[55:54] at this this persecution or this squeeze
[55:56] as brother B used the term that he
[55:58] talked about that's coming upon the True
[56:01] Vine believer amen that's it in
[56:04] Revelation 13:1 15 and he had power to
[56:07] give life unto the image of the Beast
[56:09] that the image of the Beast should both
[56:11] speak and cause that as many as would
[56:13] not worship the image of the Beast
[56:15] should be killed now on page 131 of the
[56:19] church age book brother Bam's just been
[56:21] talking about how the devil through the
[56:23] old Roman governors had been hurling
[56:25] Christians by the thousands to their
[56:27] death had been destroying them by the
[56:29] Lions and the Gladiators and how the
[56:32] Roman Catholic Church killed the
[56:33] multitude of Believers in the Dark Ages
[56:36] then he makes this
[56:38] statement he says you think that's
[56:43] shocking yeah yeah I do brother man he
[56:45] said just wait till the prophecy of
[56:47] Revelation 13 is fulfilled so you see
[56:50] what he's comparing our Revelation 13:15
[56:52] with now you see what he's comparing it
[56:54] with now all of those the Gladiators and
[56:56] the Lions and the p and all of those
[56:58] things read Fox's book of martyr
[57:00] Smuckers glorious alation all those
[57:01] things he said you think that shocking
[57:03] he said just wait now till this prophecy
[57:06] is
[57:07] fulfilled
[57:08] wow whoa right he said it is strikingly
[57:13] true that the United States of America
[57:16] is in this chapter the very number 13 is
[57:18] a symbol of this nation it started with
[57:20] 13 colonies its flag is 13 stars 13
[57:22] stripes there's her identity I'm sorry
[57:24] there is her Destiny in the 13th chapter
[57:27] the imagees mentioned in the chapter
[57:28] will be found in all wickedness of the
[57:30] Beast that was before it as the Beast
[57:32] Rose at the Nan Council so the image
[57:35] will come out of the World Council
[57:37] churches with all ungodly and satanic
[57:39] power now watch to vent the anger of the
[57:42] devil upon the True Vine of God right
[57:47] that's right who's the anger of the
[57:49] devil going to be vented upon the True
[57:52] Vine of God we're talking about the
[57:54] value now of persecution the blessing of
[57:57] persecution it's going to be hard to say
[58:00] well praise God there's an ox over there
[58:02] there's an box over there wonder what
[58:03] they going to do with their
[58:07] box that's put it together now what to
[58:10] vent the anger of the devil upon the
[58:12] True Vine of God it will be a Repeat
[58:16] Performance of all diabolical cunning
[58:19] and cruelty right I mean know what a
[58:22] Repeat Performance
[58:23] is exactly Repeat Performance would be
[58:26] if I took my notes and preached this
[58:28] again tomorrow morning that would be
[58:30] Repeat Performance and you say well
[58:32] that's the same thing that he said last
[58:34] night this is the same thing that
[58:36] happened way back then exactly see
[58:38] what's he talking about he's talking
[58:39] about that persecution that he said thus
[58:42] sayith the Lord is coming that's one of
[58:44] the first statements I read to you
[58:45] tonight from Jezebel religion remember
[58:47] right he said there'll come a
[58:49] persecution not the tribulation period
[58:51] now we ain't going into that my God how
[58:53] much worse is that going to be
[58:56] right if this is what we're looking at
[58:57] before the tribulation my God what's the
[59:00] what's it going be back there amen he he
[59:03] said thus sayith the Lord there it will
[59:05] be right now going back to resume of the
[59:08] ages of the church age book page
[59:10] 376 he said the false Church groups will
[59:13] come together in a world Council of
[59:15] churches the World Council of churches
[59:17] is the image directed to the Beast
[59:18] Revelation 13 11-18 now remember it was
[59:22] Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the
[59:24] sword but she was healed of her
[59:26] Deathstroke when she joined the nominal
[59:27] Christian Church of Rome and
[59:28] Incorporated paganism and Christianity
[59:30] thereby became the Holy Roman Empire
[59:32] which was to endure till Jesus came and
[59:34] destroyed her but Rome is not going it
[59:36] alone her daughters are right with her
[59:38] and she'll take over absolute Authority
[59:41] by the World Council of churches right
[59:44] he goes now this may seem farfetched to
[59:48] some but actually it's very plain for
[59:52] all to see because right now the church
[59:54] are controlling
[59:56] politics
[59:59] what I thought it was the Electoral
[1:00:01] College I thought it was the you know
[1:00:03] the Rockefellers and the Rothchilds and
[1:00:05] the Illuminati and all of this other
[1:00:08] stuff no the prophet of God said the
[1:00:11] churches are controlling politics amen
[1:00:13] and at the opportune time there's always
[1:00:17] a time always a season brother at the
[1:00:19] opportune time will manifest exactly how
[1:00:22] great that control is it might not very
[1:00:26] be very obvious now how great the
[1:00:28] control is but at the opportune time we
[1:00:30] will see how listen this message just as
[1:00:32] current is tomorrow's newspaper I'm
[1:00:35] sorry yeah it is right it manifest
[1:00:38] exactly how great that control is The
[1:00:39] ecumenical move will end up with Rome at
[1:00:42] the head even though the people really
[1:00:43] didn't Envision it that way this is so
[1:00:46] because in Revelations 17 3-6 it states
[1:00:48] that the mystery Babylon is Seated
[1:00:50] on the beach she's controlling the last
[1:00:52] or fourth Empire the Roman Church is
[1:00:54] doing that with the World Church system
[1:00:56] under her Rome will be controlling and
[1:00:58] this image church system will be
[1:01:01] obedient to Rome because Rome controls
[1:01:03] the gold of the world th all the people
[1:01:05] have to belong to the World Church
[1:01:07] system or be at the mercy of the
[1:01:10] elements for they cannot buy or sell
[1:01:13] without the mark of the beast in the
[1:01:14] hand or him amen exactly the mark of the
[1:01:17] hand means they'll have to take the
[1:01:18] doctrine of the World Church system
[1:01:20] which is trinitarianism and the mark of
[1:01:22] the hand which means to do the will of
[1:01:24] the World Church now watch he says with
[1:01:28] this great power the church systems will
[1:01:33] persecute the true bride right amen now
[1:01:36] do you see let me just stop there do you
[1:01:37] see that we're not just going to you
[1:01:39] know come to church come and go come and
[1:01:41] go go God bless you praise the Lord and
[1:01:42] all of a sudden just be whed away we're
[1:01:44] gone just want wo us we're gone you hear
[1:01:47] these things the prophet of God is
[1:01:48] saying all right with this great power
[1:01:51] and to me I'm and maybe I'm gracious but
[1:01:53] I'm looking forward to this amen
[1:01:55] I'm looking forward to this oh kill
[1:01:58] somebody's guitar up
[1:02:00] here I've done it before not you see
[1:02:02] what I'm saying right because brother B
[1:02:04] said this is this is to ascertain the
[1:02:06] quality of what well bless God I'm this
[1:02:08] I'm that well yeah you say you are but
[1:02:09] wait till the test comes we'll find out
[1:02:11] it'll weed it out now it'll shift out
[1:02:13] the truth amen who's got it who don't
[1:02:16] who's got an experience who's got a
[1:02:18] confession yes it will yes sir amen
[1:02:21] great time coming friend amen you say
[1:02:23] glory to God glory to God with this
[1:02:25] great power now the church systems will
[1:02:27] persecute the true bride this a the
[1:02:29] tribulation period but this is a
[1:02:30] persecution angel said oh Jesus said oh
[1:02:32] you're just blessed Glory oh you're just
[1:02:34] blessed he said the image what will try
[1:02:37] to keep the bride from preaching and
[1:02:41] teaching somebody say will try they will
[1:02:44] try to keep the bride from preaching and
[1:02:46] teaching right her ministers will be
[1:02:49] forbidden to give comfort and Truth to
[1:02:51] the people who need it but before the
[1:02:53] Antichrist in person takes over the
[1:02:54] complete World System of churches the
[1:02:56] true church will be taken away from this
[1:02:58] world to be with the Lord God will catch
[1:03:00] away his Bri for the great marriage amen
[1:03:03] amen so we'll be here for at least oh a
[1:03:07] marginal time a preliminary stage if you
[1:03:10] will of Satan's plan to take over the
[1:03:11] complete World System of churches
[1:03:13] through the World Council we'll
[1:03:15] definitely be here for little short
[1:03:17] season after this process is started and
[1:03:19] while the persecution is on and I'll
[1:03:21] show you why in just a minute why we
[1:03:23] have to be here during this time cuz the
[1:03:25] prophet deals with that also
[1:03:28] now in the message what shall I do with
[1:03:30] Jesus called
[1:03:31] Christ in November 1963 brother bam said
[1:03:35] now in the Council of churches all the
[1:03:38] churches must belong to this Council
[1:03:40] right even the bride churches all
[1:03:41] churches or if they don't you're not
[1:03:44] allowed to preach see that's that's
[1:03:46] that's that's that's the drawback see
[1:03:48] we're not going to join it so what's the
[1:03:49] what's the penalty what's the punishment
[1:03:51] can't preach he says so if you don't
[1:03:53] you're not allowed to preach but you

[1:04:55] life that I might inquire in his Temple
[1:04:57] and behold the beauty of the Lord right
[1:04:59] amen amen amen but I watch he said this
[1:05:03] image will try to now try to but not
[1:05:06] going to all right you're not allowed to
[1:05:07] preach he said he said uh you're not
[1:05:09] even allowed to have prayer for the sick
[1:05:11] right and your church can be used for
[1:05:12] anything they wanted to for if they
[1:05:14] close if they store they can store boxes
[1:05:16] in it ammunition in it whatever they
[1:05:17] want to do you got no control over it
[1:05:19] exactly you either belong to the Council
[1:05:21] of churches or you don't belong at all
[1:05:23] that's the system that being formed here
[1:05:25] in the United States now watch this that
[1:05:28] fulfills the scripture to the dot right
[1:05:32] he said it fulfills what the Lord spoke
[1:05:34] to me back in
[1:05:37] 1933 I looked it I thought what in the
[1:05:39] Lord what did the Lord speak to him in
[1:05:41] 1933 and I began to look at go back
[1:05:43] there you know what I found in
[1:05:45] 1933 brother Bram said the Lord spoke to
[1:05:47] him a vision give him a vision in 1933
[1:05:51] and the Lord showed him seven things
[1:05:53] that would take place are transpired
[1:05:56] before what he called in Daniel 7 weeks
[1:05:58] the great consummation see what's he
[1:06:01] referring here to what he's referring
[1:06:03] here to is the great vision of the woman
[1:06:05] that he saw who would rise up now in
[1:06:08] America the Lord told him see on the
[1:06:10] sixth Vision he said be spiritual see
[1:06:13] the first five were natural you know the
[1:06:14] magal line and this would take into the
[1:06:16] isms and so forth and then when he come
[1:06:18] to the six he says now be spiritual
[1:06:19] shift from the natural now to the
[1:06:21] spiritual he said she'd be cruel in
[1:06:23] heart beautiful to look at would leader
[1:06:25] God this country to ruination and he
[1:06:27] identifies right here now that it's the
[1:06:30] World Council of churches and did you
[1:06:32] know that actually five times after the
[1:06:33] opening of the seals he identified it to
[1:06:35] be the World Council of churches this
[1:06:37] this woman he's talking about you just
[1:06:39] have to follow progression as he brings
[1:06:41] it up in souls in prison he said the
[1:06:43] Council of churches over there now
[1:06:45] meeting in Rome he said that's just
[1:06:47] exactly what's wrote on my book of
[1:06:49] Prophecy in
[1:06:51] 1933 that would take place and on 30 of
[1:06:54] this message he really blasted David
[1:06:56] duplicities for going over to Rome you
[1:06:58] know for that ecumenical that ecumenical
[1:07:00] council and he says again on paragraph 6
[1:07:02] of page 35 he said the first word said
[1:07:05] it first the word said it then the
[1:07:07] spirit of the Lord said in 33 told all
[1:07:09] these other things that would happen he
[1:07:11] said and here it is it's never failed
[1:07:14] and here we see it shaping up Jehovah gy
[1:07:18] he said listen it showed that'd be an
[1:07:20] ecumenical council how all the churches
[1:07:22] would come together would form the image
[1:07:24] in the mark of the beast and he says he
[1:07:25] gave me seven things that would happen
[1:07:27] every one of them has come to pass now
[1:07:30] uh leadership she's head for the World
[1:07:31] Council of church the EIC coun that's
[1:07:33] where she's gone right back to WR where
[1:07:34] she come from I got it wrote back on
[1:07:36] paper from 25 years ago 33 years ago not
[1:07:39] only that it's wrote in the Bible from a
[1:07:41] vision amen he said now she's gone back
[1:07:43] no way Sav it's gone got to be that way
[1:07:46] now back to our subject can I take just
[1:07:49] a few more minutes amen he says now in
[1:07:51] church order he says now where we're
[1:07:54] here he said to hold a standard in this
[1:07:56] even that when the world is dark and and
[1:07:59] the whole world kingdom is going into
[1:08:01] the Council of churches pretty soon
[1:08:03] they'll tack a sign on this door they'll
[1:08:05] try to tack a sign on this door here
[1:08:06] closed and then we're going to have to
[1:08:08] meet other places cuz they'll certainly
[1:08:12] close these churches right now he's
[1:08:14] preaching in brandham Tabernacle and so
[1:08:16] he's talking about brandom Tabernacle
[1:08:18] too but but but he's telling us that
[1:08:21] that that he's not going to stop
[1:08:22] preaching just because the church
[1:08:23] billing his CL right and that's what
[1:08:24] he's talking about in Christ's mystery
[1:08:26] when he said she'll not be closed up
[1:08:28] she'll be taken out all right so he so
[1:08:31] he said we'll have to meet other places
[1:08:33] in other words no we a we we ain't
[1:08:34] taking a card we ain't joining up with
[1:08:36] that thing we'll just meet other places
[1:08:38] cuz the building that's all it is is
[1:08:39] just a building he said one of these
[1:08:42] days if we don't take the mark of the
[1:08:43] beast and we're depending on staying
[1:08:44] true to god Till Death sets us free and
[1:08:46] that's what we intend to do amen so on
[1:08:49] and on and over and over he goes on to
[1:08:51] warn the Bride of this hour of
[1:08:52] persecution is is coming so we wouldn't
[1:08:54] be ignorant of what's next on God's
[1:08:57] prophetic calendar then in December 1963
[1:09:00] and I really love this he begins to talk
[1:09:02] about the power of the third poll in
[1:09:04] that hour and its relation to the bride
[1:09:07] and you know where I'm going page six
[1:09:09] Look Away to Jesus he says I'm going to
[1:09:11] say something to you now he said I said
[1:09:12] had said all along that is the very
[1:09:14] thing we've looked forward to so long
[1:09:15] for many years four or five years maybe
[1:09:17] longer the third pull has been
[1:09:18] Vindicated I'm sure you know what it is
[1:09:20] remember there'll be many impersonations
[1:09:22] of that but not this it came be it's in
[1:09:25] existence and I'm warned of this that
[1:09:26] soon right now it just happened so it
[1:09:28] could identify its presence among you
[1:09:30] but now watch it'll not be used in a
[1:09:32] great way until this Council begins to
[1:09:34] tighten up exactly I'm about the third
[1:09:38] Po and all of the things you can
[1:09:39] associate with the third po might and we
[1:09:41] say my God they were great things he
[1:09:42] said well a great way so what's coming
[1:09:45] out is going to be a great thing
[1:09:47] compared to just what Aver things I
[1:09:49] don't know it'll not be used in a great
[1:09:52] way until the council begins to up and
[1:09:54] when it does when that does the
[1:09:56] Pentecostals and so forth oh they almost
[1:09:58] impers anything that can be done but
[1:10:00] when that time comes when the squeeze
[1:10:02] comes down then you'll see what you have
[1:10:04] seen temporarily right see under his
[1:10:07] ministry be manifested in the fullness
[1:10:10] of his power so see these adopted Sons
[1:10:13] adopted Sons manifested Sons are coming
[1:10:15] to this now the end result of they're
[1:10:17] placing now the character is form she
[1:10:19] standing she knows she knows all about
[1:10:21] it now right the perfect interpretation
[1:10:23] understand all of that now wisdom
[1:10:25] understanding knowledge now she's
[1:10:26] standing there is redeemed Sons adoped
[1:10:29] Sons now he says now you're going to see
[1:10:30] the third Po manifested in the fullest
[1:10:33] power like
[1:10:34] it that's through you and you and you
[1:10:36] and you and you and you but the
[1:10:37] character's got to be there first see so
[1:10:40] it's not going to be used in a great
[1:10:42] way that is in the fullness of its power
[1:10:46] right until the Council of churches
[1:10:48] begins to tighten up in other words when
[1:10:49] the squeeze comes down that's when the
[1:10:51] third pull will be fully manifested in
[1:10:53] in the bride and on display is that what
[1:10:55] he said amen so now now we're beginning
[1:10:59] to see a purpose for this persecution
[1:11:01] now that's being prophesied we're
[1:11:03] beginning to see this now the squeeze
[1:11:05] coming on now I differ from and I love
[1:11:07] the brothers I differ from the return
[1:11:09] Ministry brothers who believe that
[1:11:10] brother Adam is going to have a prophet
[1:11:11] Resurrection we talk about today to come
[1:11:14] forth and finish this third pull
[1:11:15] Ministry there's a lot of deviations to
[1:11:17] this got private Ministry brother do the
[1:11:19] third pull and soore but I tell you one
[1:11:21] thing they're going to have a pretty
[1:11:22] hard time with this quote if they don't
[1:11:24] see the BR not only possesses the power
[1:11:27] of the spoken word but she is the one
[1:11:28] that's ordained to operate this when the
[1:11:30] squeeze tightens up
[1:11:32] am brother ad spoke the words of
[1:11:34] original C he says now notice what
[1:11:36] Harmony Jesus never did anything to C
[1:11:39] the Father the father showed him first
[1:11:40] Harmony between God and Christ see John
[1:11:42] 5:19 so will the bride he shows her his
[1:11:45] Word of Life she receives it she never
[1:11:47] doubts it nothing can harm her not even
[1:11:49] death but if the seed be planted the
[1:11:50] water will raise it up again here's the
[1:11:52] secret the word is in the bride and the
[1:11:55] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:11:57] done with the word that's why we've got
[1:11:59] our instructions and know what he wants
[1:12:01] done with the word what he's telling us
[1:12:02] here tonight even and she does it in his
[1:12:05] name she has thus sayth the Lord amen
[1:12:09] I'm know the final voice Amen on her
[1:12:12] messenger is in the bride I'm sorry
[1:12:15] somebody wants to put everything in the
[1:12:16] profit but you got to realize there's a
[1:12:18] part for you and me to play in this
[1:12:20] great Plan of Redemption the prophet's
[1:12:21] not here anymore he's playing role his
[1:12:24] ministry is over it's completed it's
[1:12:26] fulfilled he's done what was written of
[1:12:28] him to do it's Bri time now brother and
[1:12:30] sister Elijah's manle amen is falling
[1:12:33] upon the
[1:12:34] life he says now then it is gerti so the
[1:12:38] Holy Spirit wers it till it's grown and
[1:12:40] serves his purpose they do only his will
[1:12:43] no one can persuade them different they
[1:12:45] have thus sayith the Lord they keep
[1:12:47] still then they will do the works of God
[1:12:50] for it is himself in them continuing his
[1:12:53] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[1:12:56] his day all things when he was here
[1:12:57] didn't complete when he was here for it
[1:12:58] wasn't time yet but now on the bride
[1:13:01] coming of Christ it is time to fulfill
[1:13:03] Serv now in back to look away to Jesus
[1:13:06] brother bam says therefore you've had
[1:13:08] the word you know what to look for and
[1:13:11] you know how to stand right see so we
[1:13:13] can say now we've read enough tonight to
[1:13:15] show you that I know you'd be able to
[1:13:17] say Amen brother B I know what to look
[1:13:19] for and I know how to stand rightly tell
[1:13:23] us this so we go yeah okay yeah we do
[1:13:26] brother I don't think I recall too many
[1:13:28] other times when brother actually
[1:13:29] pointed to something and said look for
[1:13:31] this to happen right when you see this
[1:13:33] happen watch for this to happen right
[1:13:35] because when it does he says in the next
[1:13:38] paragraph this will be the thing that
[1:13:40] will start the rapturing faith for the
[1:13:42] going away all right so we're going to
[1:13:46] connect here one thing with another see
[1:13:48] when this happens he said then that has
[1:13:50] to follow now my in my opinion this will
[1:13:54] be the thing that will that will
[1:13:55] transform our our passive faith and
[1:13:58] transition it to an active
[1:14:00] faith for the hours approaching swiftly
[1:14:03] now reading again he said uh when
[1:14:05] something is going to be done I'm
[1:14:07] dropping back here watching that spot
[1:14:08] waiting for the time to use it because
[1:14:11] it's going to be used he's talking about
[1:14:13] the third P Glory it's going to be used
[1:14:15] and everyone knows that for certain is
[1:14:17] the first was identified the second is
[1:14:19] being first P second you then you think
[1:14:21] real closely you who are spiritual now
[1:14:23] the Bible said here's to him who has
[1:14:24] wisdom the third is a properly
[1:14:26] identified we know where it is so the
[1:14:28] third p is here all right I said on page
[1:14:31] six he said this will be the thing that
[1:14:33] will start or activate or put into
[1:14:35] action the rapturing faith for the going
[1:14:38] of going away right one definition of
[1:14:41] start means to launch this will be the
[1:14:43] thing that launches it he says I got lay
[1:14:45] quiet for a while we're right at the age
[1:14:46] now can't go any
[1:14:48] farther absolutely can't go any farther
[1:14:50] because they know they don't know
[1:14:51] whether ain's coming we know that we've
[1:14:53] Advanced to the top of the pyramid is
[1:14:54] that right we've come full circle Alpha
[1:14:57] has become Omega life is in the grain
[1:14:59] again Christ has reproduced himself in
[1:15:01] the bride the prophecies are all filled
[1:15:03] except the Diabolical manifestation of
[1:15:05] the image she's still working out there
[1:15:08] that's it all right brother mam still
[1:15:10] now page seven look over Jesus there's
[1:15:12] coming A Time In This Nation to where
[1:15:15] the nation is going to exercise all the
[1:15:17] power that the Beast had which was Pagan
[1:15:19] Rome and it became Pap Rome a church
[1:15:22] that this nation will do that Revelation
[1:15:23] 13 fully explains it Mak it a power that
[1:15:26] will force all Protestants like the
[1:15:27] union you'll have to be in the Council
[1:15:29] of churches you won't be able to have
[1:15:30] Fellowship now persons like ourselves
[1:15:32] we're going to be cut out of that all
[1:15:34] together persons like our we're going to
[1:15:36] be cut out of that all together he said
[1:15:39] that is exactly it's tightening and then
[1:15:41] when that time comes and the press the
[1:15:44] squeeze comes to a place where you're
[1:15:46] all we pressed out then watch what I'm
[1:15:49] fixing to tell you watch the third pull

[1:17:31] the bride and the church now watch this
[1:17:33] in Shalom s sista amazing watch this
[1:17:36] shista Arizona 1964 January
[1:17:39] 12 he said and we all know that the
[1:17:42] identification we know what the third
[1:17:44] pull is we all understand that you have
[1:17:47] the tape he says now I think it'll just
[1:17:49] lay dormant for a little
[1:17:51] while the Third third po yes sir cuz we
[1:17:54] look around and say Pastor why all this
[1:17:55] taking place and that taking place and
[1:17:56] eyes over blind eyes this getting up out
[1:17:59] of the beds and the Wheelchairs and all
[1:18:01] well that third Pole's dormant right now
[1:18:03] he said it'll be dormant for a while you
[1:18:05] know what dormant means when something
[1:18:07] is dormant according to the dictionary
[1:18:10] it's in an inactive State it's
[1:18:13] temporarily inactive or not in use the D
[1:18:17] dictionary Likens it as a volcano that's
[1:18:20] not erupting but neither is it
[1:18:24] extinct we're sitting on the volcano
[1:18:26] friend we might feel the smoke feel the
[1:18:29] heat a little bit but it hadn't erupted
[1:18:31] yet amen cuz God's still working on me
[1:18:34] see that's another phase of this talk
[1:18:36] about we got to come to the Perfection
[1:18:37] being made perfect we're still in that
[1:18:39] phase now right see so the volcano it's
[1:18:42] here but ain't erupted yet right and
[1:18:43] that describes very nicely the third
[1:18:45] pool if you ask me like the volcano we
[1:18:47] know it's here it's not extinct but it's
[1:18:49] just not time yet for it to erupt right
[1:18:51] right brother B teach us to principle of
[1:18:53] times and Seasons y that God has a time
[1:18:55] God has a season for all things yes he
[1:18:57] did so it's not enough to go out there
[1:18:59] and grab a scripture try to make it work
[1:19:01] it's got to be the time and the season
[1:19:02] for it to
[1:19:04] happen I've talked for number of years
[1:19:06] what I call the John 5:19 principle
[1:19:09] brother man quote law many times Jesus
[1:19:12] answered said verely I said to you the
[1:19:13] son can do nothing of himself but what
[1:19:15] he see the father do for what things
[1:19:17] soever he doth and the son doeth
[1:19:18] likewise see and brother man I read a
[1:19:21] moment ago 120 spoken word Original Seed
[1:19:24] he said the harmony that existed between
[1:19:25] the father and the son is now to exist
[1:19:27] between Christ and his bride then he
[1:19:29] quoted John 5:19 right Jesus didn't
[1:19:32] arbitrarily go out there and do this and
[1:19:33] do that he went to the pool of Sal he
[1:19:35] walked through maybe 100 people and
[1:19:36] touch one person that made protic
[1:19:38] trouble right right see now you know if
[1:19:42] mother terca would have been there she'
[1:19:43] probably been there for four or five
[1:19:44] days praying and ministering and whatnot
[1:19:46] bandaging all that stuff Jesus W excuse
[1:19:48] me pardon me oh that looks bad you get
[1:19:49] that Ted to oh you got put a SP on that
[1:19:51] over there Jesus t no no I'm sorry just
[1:19:54] go hey get up come let's go right that's
[1:19:57] Jesus that's comp oh he didn't have
[1:19:58] compassion brother said compassion human
[1:20:00] sympathy right he didn't move with human
[1:20:02] sympathy right he said compassion is
[1:20:05] doing the will of God father show him
[1:20:08] one he's that man over that's the one I
[1:20:09] want okay right exactly
[1:20:12] amen so that tells me that John 5:19
[1:20:15] applies to the bride even it is applied
[1:20:17] to Jesus himself same as John 10:30 I
[1:20:20] and my father are one right brother man
[1:20:21] said on page 18 he's not there with the
[1:20:23] shark but you can come to say I'm my
[1:20:24] father one and all these other
[1:20:27] things he said then the shark begins to
[1:20:29] pull away why because you're seeing who
[1:20:31] you are you're begin to give voice to
[1:20:33] that now which God has revealed to you
[1:20:34] in your own heart right amen rising of
[1:20:36] the sun page 34 brother said the same
[1:20:38] word that spoke of the groom speaks of
[1:20:40] the Bride you want to have fun with that
[1:20:41] and go in the scripture and see all the
[1:20:43] scriptures that pertain to Jesus brother
[1:20:44] said the same word speaks to him now
[1:20:46] speaks to
[1:20:47] you I'm a father one heart now all about
[1:20:49] all these other
[1:20:51] thingsall that don't put you on a series
[1:20:53] in the last for a while no yeah it would
[1:20:56] so if Jesus could do nothing until the
[1:20:59] father showed him first what do you
[1:21:01] think you're going to go out there and
[1:21:02] do what do you think you're going to go
[1:21:03] out there and do for God in the absence
[1:21:05] of a direct word from heaven we all
[1:21:08] going step out there and boy storm
[1:21:09] disappear that the other you know and
[1:21:12] maybe from time to time maybe something
[1:21:13] will come to pass but here but here John
[1:21:16] 5:19 here's our parameters right we do
[1:21:19] nothing until God instructs us to do it
[1:21:21] first right amen amen H yes sir God
[1:21:25] wants you to have something Heist he'll
[1:21:26] bring you to you right you can't go out
[1:21:28] and get something Prophet told us just
[1:21:30] to be patient wait for him to bring it
[1:21:31] to you God wants you have to bring it to
[1:21:32] you you can't miss it so he goes on to
[1:21:35] say I think it'll just lay dormant the
[1:21:37] third pulled out until the great hour of
[1:21:42] persecution comes on Glory praise God
[1:21:45] we're going to manifest the the third

[1:21:50] I want the milk without the cow it don't
[1:21:53] work that way I want the chicken without
[1:21:55] the feathers and without the bones so I
[1:21:57] have to go to AR I guess to get yes
[1:21:59] that's an inside joke I guess yall
[1:22:01] probably don't
[1:22:04] know he says until the great hour of
[1:22:08] persecution comes on he said that's when
[1:22:12] it'll speak right right it'll be
[1:22:15] manifested watch just like the five
[1:22:17] straight signs without failure perfectly
[1:22:20] right what's he talking about y had he
[1:22:22] right sister meus tumor speaking those
[1:22:24] squirrels into existence the Colorado
[1:22:26] Storm the little fish that laid dead in
[1:22:28] the water for about the space of half an
[1:22:30] hour then it resurrected right I want
[1:22:33] you to know that all five of these
[1:22:34] instances speaking of the word they were
[1:22:36] done at the command of the Lord the
[1:22:38] prophet of God did just arbitrarily go

[1:22:41] that's a storm coming up and I really
[1:22:42] want to hunt yeah I'm just going to get

[1:22:54] helpless helpless that's why we some
[1:22:56] fall in our face too much well I'm going

[1:22:59] do
[1:23:00] this lot of times it just doesn't come
[1:23:02] together like that s because we lack the
[1:23:04] inspiration to do those and that's what
[1:23:06] brother I'm taught us Faith was it's a
[1:23:08] revelation if God reveals something one
[1:23:09] way or another however then yes it'll be

[1:23:28] done just get me explained just wait
[1:23:31] it'll not be in operation so perfectly
[1:23:33] now just wait till that Council of
[1:23:35] churches brings on that persecution
[1:23:38] that's when it'll happen oh it don't get
[1:23:40] much clearer than this brother and
[1:23:41] sister that's when what will happen
[1:23:44] that's when the full manifestation of
[1:23:45] the third po that's been dormant in the
[1:23:48] BR that's when it will erupt Vol that's
[1:23:52] when it become active and no longer dant
[1:23:54] do you see it wait on let Council
[1:23:56] churches brings on that persecution
[1:23:58] that's when it'll happen so if the
[1:23:59] fullness of the third pull is going to
[1:24:00] be manifest in the bride and that's not
[1:24:02] going to happen to the Council of
[1:24:03] churches brings of persecution and we
[1:24:05] got to see that the bride will
[1:24:06] absolutely be here at least for short
[1:24:08] duration during that time of persecution
[1:24:11] to fully fully manifest that third pool
[1:24:14] amen I I I want to see that I want to be
[1:24:16] a part of that amen amen yes sir so we
[1:24:19] learn here that during the time of the
[1:24:21] squeeze or the time that the church
[1:24:22] state has become one and is forcing
[1:24:24] their beliefs on everybody it's at that
[1:24:27] time the prophet of God said watch the
[1:24:28] third P then right other words it'll be
[1:24:31] manifested in his power that's when
[1:24:32] it'll happen he said that's when you'll
[1:24:34] see those scriptures come to life that
[1:24:36] you've been praying about and wondering
[1:24:37] why they hadn't been working for you
[1:24:38] Mark 11:23 say to this mountain speak
[1:24:41] that say that ask what you will whatever
[1:24:43] you say see see what I'm saying Time of
[1:24:45] the Season amen only only once he said
[1:24:48] third pole opening the word the Myst is
[1:24:49] revealed remember the third pole was he
[1:24:51] opening the s uh to reveal the hidden
[1:24:53] truth that's been sealed in the word
[1:24:56] amen amen so the third point is what it
[1:24:58] is the true bride's message it's the
[1:25:00] king sword it's the tent Vision it's the
[1:25:02] opening of the S it's the Mysteries
[1:25:04] revealed but it's also Mark 11:23 it's
[1:25:06] John 14:12 as was manifested in the
[1:25:09] prophet's Ministry in the creation of
[1:25:11] the squirrels hady right the tumor T the
[1:25:14] Colorado Storm little fish giving back
[1:25:16] his life it's what the bride is coming
[1:25:18] to and will come to before the Rapture
[1:25:20] and it'll take a squeeze to bring it on
[1:25:22] amen that's right it happened first in
[1:25:24] the prophet but through the word he
[1:25:26] preached the bride was to re receive
[1:25:29] what a faith to manifest that third pull
[1:25:31] also when the squeeze comes watch the
[1:25:33] third pull then amen all right now
[1:25:36] listen in the absence of a prophet who's
[1:25:38] going to manifest it the only one here
[1:25:40] that can manifest it that's right see
[1:25:42] now we'll say Amen here cuz we believe
[1:25:44] that but you wouldn't believe the scores
[1:25:45] of messes brothers that believe that the
[1:25:47] brides got nothing to do whatsoever with
[1:25:49] the third point they say it was a
[1:25:51] prophet's Ministry and none dare outside
[1:25:53] of that Prophet have anything to do with
[1:25:54] it therefore brother Adam's got to come
[1:25:56] back in a prophet Resurrection manifest

[1:26:52] listen you love the word I know that you
[1:26:55] on page 361 the church age book brother
[1:26:57] man says the lay of seen age ends in a
[1:27:00] blackout of the word thereby causing a
[1:27:01] departure of the Lord from the MST he
[1:27:04] stands outside calling to his own who
[1:27:05] follow him by obedience to the word
[1:27:07] watch after a short and Powerful
[1:27:10] demonstration of the Spirit come he
[1:27:13] talking aboutuh that's right amen who's
[1:27:16] here to do
[1:27:17] it after a short and Powerful
[1:27:21] demonstration of the spirit this little
[1:27:24] hunted and persecuted group will go to
[1:27:26] be with Jesus see how he puts that in
[1:27:28] all of these things begin to come
[1:27:29] together just perfectly right amen amen
[1:27:32] all right so let me get back I told you
[1:27:34] I was going to get back to 3113 of the
[1:27:35] church hbook he said now the Temptation
[1:27:37] will be exactly as it was in Eden it'll
[1:27:40] be a very inviting proposition held up
[1:27:41] in direct opposition to God's commanded
[1:27:43] word and yet from the standpoint of
[1:27:44] human reasoning it'll be so right so
[1:27:46] enlightening life giv to fool the world
[1:27:48] The ecumenical move that has started on
[1:27:50] what seems to be such a beautiful
[1:27:51] blessing
[1:27:52] principle uh maybe I already read that
[1:27:54] so let me just move down unless under
[1:27:56] direct denom
[1:27:58] domination uh let's see did I read that
[1:28:00] I don't know if I did go ahead now uh he
[1:28:04] says now
[1:28:07] watch he says uh he says little groups
[1:28:12] here's where I meant to pick up little
[1:28:13] groups will lose charges privileges lose
[1:28:15] property and spiritual rights with the
[1:28:16] people for example now L the local
[1:28:18] Ministerial Association approves in many
[1:28:19] if not most cities one cannot rent a
[1:28:21] building for religious services to
[1:28:23] become chap of the armed services
[1:28:25] hospitals is now almost mandatory to be
[1:28:27] recognized as acceptable to The
[1:28:29] trinitarian ecumenical groups as this
[1:28:32] pressure increases and it will it'll be
[1:28:34] harder to resist for to resist is to
[1:28:36] lose privilege and so many will be
[1:28:38] tempted to go along for they'll feel
[1:28:40] it's better to serve God publicly and I
[1:28:43] dare say a lot of yeah come on maybe
[1:28:45] weaker message believer will be called
[1:28:47] up in this cuz he says here's what
[1:28:48] they're going to well it would be better
[1:28:49] to serve God in that we'll just we'll be
[1:28:51] private Believers you know listen God
[1:28:53] ain't got no secret service
[1:28:55] department no friend you're a Frontline
[1:28:58] believer you know you just you ain't
[1:29:00] close enough to the front line then
[1:29:02] right he so they will convince
[1:29:05] themselves it's better to serve God
[1:29:07] publicly in the framework of the
[1:29:08] organization they not serve God at all
[1:29:10] yeah but they heir rightly to believe
[1:29:12] the devil's lies to serve Satan even
[1:29:14] though you may want to call him Jehovah
[1:29:15] the elect will not be deceived right
[1:29:17] right furthermore the elect will not
[1:29:18] only be kept but his move becomes image
[1:29:21] Ed the Beast the Saints will be gone in
[1:29:23] the Rapture this little delightful
[1:29:25] windome movement that started out in
[1:29:26] fellowship at Ephesus will become the
[1:29:28] monster of Satan that defiles and
[1:29:30] deceives the whole world the church
[1:29:32] system of the Roman Catholic and
[1:29:33] Protestant will in coming together will
[1:29:36] control the whole wealth of the world
[1:29:38] and force the whole world into its
[1:29:39] religious trap or will kill them by
[1:29:42] refusing them the privilege of buying
[1:29:44] and selling whereby they'd make a living
[1:29:46] right it'll be accomplished simply for
[1:29:47] the harlot's daughters all but gone back
[1:29:49] into her in the meantime Rome has
[1:29:51] acquired nearly all the the supplies of
[1:29:52] gold the Jews have the bonds and all the
[1:29:54] paper and at the right time the Harlot
[1:29:56] will destroy the present day money
[1:29:58] system by calling in all the paper and
[1:30:01] demanding gold with no gold the system
[1:30:04] fails the Jews will be trapped come into
[1:30:06] the alliance the Harlot church will go
[1:30:08] take over the world he spoke this 46
[1:30:10] years ago and we're living right on the
[1:30:12] T I'm just trying to remind you some
[1:30:14] things tonight putting your in
[1:30:16] remembrance of things the prophet
[1:30:17] already said let me share this with you
[1:30:20] 1997 a congressman by the of Frank Wolf
[1:30:23] and 26 others introduced HR 2431 a bill
[1:30:28] that's already been passed setting
[1:30:30] up an office of religious persecution
[1:30:33] mon uh monitoring or called the orpm a
[1:30:37] national director has already been
[1:30:39] appointed by the president of the United
[1:30:40] States because this director is under
[1:30:43] the supervision of the United Nations
[1:30:45] and has no congressional oversight he's
[1:30:48] been referred to as the US religious zar
[1:30:52] the opm's edicts don't even require
[1:30:55] their approval of the president as as HR
[1:30:58] 2431 gives the orpm authority to declare
[1:31:02] sanctions and coordinate their
[1:31:04] implementation with lesser State
[1:31:06] departments I'd like to share with you
[1:31:08] some of the provisions set forth in this
[1:31:10] bill that's already passed and is a law
[1:31:12] brother B said remember now it's just a
[1:31:14] law that holds it down
[1:31:16] exactly number one they are to study
[1:31:19] Rank and evaluate all religions number
[1:31:21] two
[1:31:22] approve or disapprove licenses for all
[1:31:24] ministers I say we will not pass this
[1:31:28] test number three establish national
[1:31:31] standards for acceptable religious
[1:31:32] practices number four bring penalties
[1:31:34] against churches that won't comply
[1:31:36] number five forbid Financial
[1:31:38] contributions to churches not approved
[1:31:40] number six seize bank accounts and
[1:31:42] property of those not approved number
[1:31:44] seven monitor newspapers TV radio mail
[1:31:46] and internet for violation of hate
[1:31:49] laws number eight Target spiritually
[1:31:52] defective individuals who refuse their
[1:31:54] Unity
[1:31:56] oh yeah yeah we're spiritually defective
[1:31:59] all
[1:32:00] right by whose measuring right theirs
[1:32:02] not our number nine work with the
[1:32:04] government law enforcement agencies to
[1:32:05] see that religious unity laws are
[1:32:07] enforced and all and that all churches
[1:32:09] and religious organizations are
[1:32:10] registered with the orpm I want you to
[1:32:13] understand brother sister that these
[1:32:14] laws are already in effect and await the
[1:32:17] right time and right season before we're
[1:32:19] going to feel their effect again can I
[1:32:21] read to you only a law holds that down
[1:32:24] let me read to you very briefly now an
[1:32:25] article I'm going going to take just
[1:32:26] another minute if it' be okay an article
[1:32:28] I ran across a while back you can still
[1:32:30] find it on the Internet it's still there
[1:32:33] and it's entitled Bill Clinton signs
[1:32:35] Bill to persecute Born Again Christians
[1:32:37] American president Bill Clint course
[1:32:39] this is back I never could understand
[1:32:40] why a man who had so sullied and
[1:32:43] desecrated the highest office in the
[1:32:44] land the overal office they turn around
[1:32:46] American people were so duped into
[1:32:47] voting this this guy back in a second
[1:32:49] time and I wondered why I wondered why I
[1:32:51] wonder why well listen God's going to
[1:32:53] have a man in there that he needs to do
[1:32:55] he's the one that signed it in 1995 95
[1:32:58] or 96 which was his second term he had
[1:33:00] to be in there and sign it cuz George
[1:33:01] Bush has probably had a little bit more
[1:33:03] God than what this man did if he got any
[1:33:05] at all they all claim to have a little
[1:33:06] bit of
[1:33:08] God so he had to sign it and he did sign
[1:33:10] it it will impose he he he has signed
[1:33:14] into law a bill which will impose
[1:33:17] economic measures or sanctions against
[1:33:19] any religious group which will refuse to
[1:33:21] unite with the rest of the religions of
[1:33:22] the world the bill called International
[1:33:25] Religious Freedom Act has been signed
[1:33:26] into law with reference number
[1:33:30] 2431 the bill which has now become law
[1:33:33] will approve or disapprove licenses for
[1:33:35] pastors priests teachers evangelist also
[1:33:38] bring sanctions against individuals
[1:33:40] churches and religious organizations
[1:33:42] that do not comply with federal
[1:33:44] guidelines particularly noteworthy is
[1:33:47] that under this law punishment has been
[1:33:49] stated for individuals or groups who
[1:33:51] could commit hate crimes by asserting
[1:33:53] that their
[1:33:54] religions their scripture or their deity
[1:33:59] is exclusive or Superior to others oh
[1:34:03] Lord we might we might just throw our
[1:34:04] hands up now we might just throw our
[1:34:07] hands up now you ain't going to talk
[1:34:09] your way out of this
[1:34:11] am uh such statements as I am the Lord
[1:34:15] and there's no one above me oh if you
[1:34:18] want to quote that if it's found in the
[1:34:20] scripture of any religion it becomes
[1:34:23] illegal and attracts imprisonment to
[1:34:25] members of such a group oh Pastor priest
[1:34:28] or official of such religion will have
[1:34:30] their licenses withdrawn so that it
[1:34:31] becomes altogether illegal for them to
[1:34:33] discuss their religious convictions with
[1:34:35] anyone this development is brought into
[1:34:37] a climax brought to a climax a series of
[1:34:40] underground Arrangements a series of
[1:34:43] underground Arrangements a you didn't
[1:34:46] read this in USA Today you didn't catch
[1:34:48] this in the Washington Post of the New
[1:34:49] York Times or the Wall Street Journal
[1:34:51] you didn't catch it on CNN or MSNBC or
[1:34:53] Fox News you didn't catch it but a
[1:34:55] series of
[1:34:56] underground let me read underground
[1:34:58] arrangements to unite all the religions
[1:35:01] in the world into one and to punish
[1:35:03] severely all those who will oppose such
[1:35:05] a move for about two decades now the
[1:35:06] churches have worked on a hidden agenda
[1:35:08] to unite all the churches under the pope
[1:35:11] and to use the pope as a central figure
[1:35:12] to unite all the religions into into
[1:35:14] into into one the program of unification
[1:35:17] has been substantially achieved through
[1:35:19] the World Council of churches and he
[1:35:22] this guy don't even know who brother Ram
[1:35:23] is right
[1:35:25] right brother Ram told us 45 years ago
[1:35:28] the same thing I'm reading tonight amen
[1:35:31] right the program is now filtered into
[1:35:32] various denominations which are at the
[1:35:35] moment working out several grounds of
[1:35:37] cooperation and subsequently unification
[1:35:40] yeah attracts imprisonment to members of
[1:35:43] such a group yeah you know what I
[1:35:44] thought when I read that where when I
[1:35:46] read that phrase right there brother bam

[1:37:35] the prophet's looking at something see
[1:37:37] what I'm saying right I was on the
[1:37:39] internet and I found a little something
[1:37:41] you can find this on apfn dog I found
[1:37:43] this article that said
[1:37:45] this over 800 prison camps are found
[1:37:48] here in the United States or over 800
[1:37:50] prison camps in United States all fully
[1:37:52] operational and ready to receive
[1:37:53] prisoners they're all staffed and even
[1:37:55] surrounded by full-time guards but
[1:37:57] they're all empty the camps all have
[1:37:59] railroad facilities as well as roads
[1:38:00] leading to and from the detention
[1:38:02] facilities many also have an airport
[1:38:04] nearby the majority of the camps can
[1:38:05] house a population of 20,000 prisoners
[1:38:07] currently the largest of these largest
[1:38:09] of these facilities is just outside
[1:38:12] Fairbanks
[1:38:15] Alaska what did the prophet see 40 years
[1:38:18] ago it wasn't there 40 years ago
[1:38:22] just outside Fairbanks Alaskan Alaskan
[1:38:24] facility is a massive mental health
[1:38:28] facility right we're just crazy a mental
[1:38:32] health facility that can hold
[1:38:34] approximately 2 million people big
[1:38:37] church it might not be too long brother
[1:38:40] sister be a big
[1:38:42] church might not be long before you know
[1:38:44] these messy churches start getting these
[1:38:47] you know these long brown official
[1:38:48] looking envelopes from the federal
[1:38:50] government stating rules that we've got
[1:38:52] to abide by in order to remain a church
[1:38:54] the motive that the American government
[1:38:56] is giving for the establishing of such
[1:38:59] an organization is this to guarantee
[1:39:02] every American the freedom for dangerous
[1:39:04] and radical religious sexs and Cults
[1:39:07] yeah and they think we apply I got a
[1:39:11] question what Mainline denomination
[1:39:13] Church system wouldn't be for the
[1:39:14] enforcing of such a bill right sure it's
[1:39:17] natural they want to be protected from
[1:39:18] those who would repeat the tragedy of
[1:39:20] Waco David KES the failing gong suicides
[1:39:24] 136 of them in China 1999 how about the
[1:39:27] gy uh in 19 the Jim Jones suicides in
[1:39:31] Guyana back in the 70s listen let we we
[1:39:33] wouldn't harm anybody but we're going to
[1:39:35] be classified as such telling you
[1:39:37] brother sister I'm going to let the
[1:39:38] musicians come it's decision time making
[1:39:42] in the message churches cuz soon there's
[1:39:44] going to be a separation of people who
[1:39:46] have called themselves message Believers
[1:39:48] right but it's only going to be those
[1:39:49] true One in a Million that true elected
[1:39:52] Gene seat of God and take a stand and
[1:39:54] refuse the fellowship card of the World
[1:39:56] Church and those without this Rapture
[1:39:58] and faith will be offered temptations
[1:40:00] that they will absolutely not be able to
[1:40:02] resist right amen they'll absolutely
[1:40:04] give in brother said on page 265 the
[1:40:07] church book it is in this age that the
[1:40:10] churches are going to come together
[1:40:11] right and as they are even now
[1:40:13] controlling World politics they will
[1:40:15] soon control the finances of the world
[1:40:18] that's right then if you don't belong to
[1:40:19] the world organization of churches you
[1:40:20] won't be able to by S you'll lose all
[1:40:22] those who stay true to God and keep
[1:40:24] their garments clean from the defilement
[1:40:25] of this world system of church orders
[1:40:27] will be physically B stripped of
[1:40:30] everything there will be presented to
[1:40:32] them a great temptation to give in
[1:40:34] Preachers will give in with the excuse
[1:40:37] that they will serve God within the
[1:40:39] framework of the Antichrist Beast system
[1:40:43] they will give into the flatteries and
[1:40:45] the blandishments of the hierarchy and
[1:40:47] the people will follow these false sheer
[1:40:51] right into the slaughter but in the
[1:40:54] Judgment they'll be found naked they'll
[1:40:56] not be given those white robes neither
[1:40:58] will they walk with him you cannot walk
[1:41:00] in the spotted garments of the world
[1:41:02] holding hands with the devil and then
[1:41:04] expect to be with God it's time to wake
[1:41:06] up and hear the voice of Christ come out
[1:41:08] of her my people be not partakers of her
[1:41:10] sins God is speaking sh the religions of
[1:41:12] the world like you sh the plague leave
[1:41:14] off walking with the world and make your
[1:41:16] garments WIP by repentance and the blood
[1:41:18] of Christ do it now before it too late
[1:41:21] glory amen the prophet of God is
[1:41:23] teaching us friend that the squeeze and
[1:41:26] the full manifestation of the third pull
[1:41:28] of the mark of the beast are all to
[1:41:29] happen right here in the same season to
[1:41:32] compromise this message in that hour and
[1:41:34] to receive the world Fellowship card is
[1:41:37] to take the mark no neutral ground amen
[1:41:40] will you have to be in rout page 274 he
[1:41:43] said it's Israel who was the chosen of
[1:41:44] God majority forfeited their rights in
[1:41:47] the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so
[1:41:49] the majority of the Gentile church will
[1:41:52] come into condemnation with the
[1:41:54] resultant removal of their names from
[1:41:56] The Book of Life by rejecting the word
[1:41:58] and entering into this world ecumenical
[1:42:00] movement which is the image of the Beast
[1:42:03] what a deceitful time what a deadly time
[1:42:05] the denominal church has to come into
[1:42:07] without realizing what's happened to
[1:42:08] them they'll go right into that thing
[1:42:10] have their removed names removed from
[1:42:11] The Book of Life they they hadn't
[1:42:13] already been removed right they'll join
[1:42:14] forces with the government they'll
[1:42:15] persecute the bride of Christ and any
[1:42:17] man for their sin they'll be cast into
[1:42:19] the Lake of Fire right right
