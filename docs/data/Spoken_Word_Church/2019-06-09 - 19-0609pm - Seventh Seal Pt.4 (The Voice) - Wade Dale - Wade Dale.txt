you on 19th through the 22nd June and I'll be going to Arizona to a meeting from brother Chris alone so there you go and well I'm sure there'll be a lot of other things filled in so let's go to revelations eight we've been speaking on the shout but today we're going to kind of continue with that but we're also to go into the voice this would be part four of the seventh sealed the voice I talked to brother Claude yesterday and we talked for about an hour and he's on he's on part 21 on the seventh seal so see what you got to look forward to and we had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half-an-hour let's bow our heads down Lee father thank you today Lord that we have a opportunity to stand before the greatest people in the face of this earth the bride of Jesus Christ and Lord that we can speak Lord and lets you do the speaking you do the revealing Lord you do you do what you're supposed to do you said If any man hear my voice then you said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow so lord I pray that we hear the voice of you today that'll not be a strange voice as in past times we've we've heard strange voices of strange doctrines strange ideas but Lord there is one voice that is correct and that's your voice Lord you've never had to take back a word that you've ever said we thank you for that Lord we put all of our confidence in what you said why do we ask you to forgive us of our sins be with us Lord in the further min of this service you take over Father for your honor and glory in Jesus name Amen you be seated we'll read John 19 verse 30 said when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and bowed his head and gave up the ghost eventually we'll get into that but as of right now we won't be but we're gonna read that so that just puts the little seed in your head because he said it is finished in other words his earthly journey was over with as far as being that part he was done it was finished but did that finish his work no no that just actually begun his work he bowed his head and gave up the ghost that's why we're talking about the seventh seal the silence in heaven there's nothing we can write on the board we make it into something later on or maybe I be able to write something on the board as God reveals it but right now you'll not see that board because there's nothing gonna be put on the board because there's silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour nothing's going on but don't tell me when Jesus said it is finished that that was it no he just continued doing his work he went on to the to the souls in prison he came and got the people paradise he went and took his body and got it glorified walk step back on the earth won't drop back among the disciples left them and told them I'll be right back in just a few days and came back on the day of Pentecost and he has not rested since and man he's been doing a job and today that's what we're going to talk about a little bit now the shout sometimes when you see a shout you it's when somebody shouts you turn to see what's going on anytime in a crowd somebody shouts you see what's to see what you look turn to see what's going on but now as we go into the voice I've said many times before you know you can you can be in a crowd and and they're all talking and all you hear is just this muddled muddled words but all of a sudden your child says mama our daddy right what do you do you know there's silence all the way around you then you're focused on what that child killed that's your child and you are connected to that child mmm so that's the same way with God when John turn to see the voice in Revelations we'll get to it he turned to see the voice and what did he see he saw seven golden candlesticks and one lock into the son of man standing there John realizing he knew that voice was all right so that's what our whole thing now is to see the shout of the voice and the Trump because the voice is the voice of the resurrection so it cannot be a voice just a voice it's got to be the voice of God amen so that's what we're going to get into today but let's kind of background a little bit the Bible says also in Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption now remember everybody's made the seventh seal this and that and the other and all these different things you heard many doctrines and many things talked about the seventh seal but if brother Claude and I were talking yesterday there's your seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God we are you're see where are you are sealed until the day of your redemption the seventh seal is your total Redemption your total Redemption not seven men with voice is not tenth vision not return ministry the Seventh Seal is your redemption so it's they've made it everything else I we were talking last night and it's true Satan Satan loves us to believe those different things that Satan's job is to get us to what get us offline from listening to the real voice of God that tells you that if this seventh seal book is a book of redemption who gets redeemed first me and you so it's the seventh seal is not this out here and and you know brother Brown says you know what this man do he looks and sees what's coming he see what's behind but he forgets what's going on right now well what's going right now on right now is it's the seven seals being open it's being open now in an individual form sure brother branham back ever how many years ago that was that seal open to him and he saw what he was but he couldn't tell all the three parts remember he said one part open yesterday one today and one was in an unknown language not that I know language is one that you and I gonna talk about maybe about 30 sermons from now hmmm Colet I believe that there's three parts to it and the unknown part that was in an unknown language has got to be revealed before the seventh seal can totally open all right so now let's just background a little bit of what we've been talking about looking go to number one but I wants to keep this in mind the seventh seal is not a happening that you can write on the board now we took the first seal wild horse rider and we wrote him across and we put white and we put a church and we put a church age with it and we put this with it and we put the number two and number three and number four number five and number six we just fill the board full right with symbols and acts and things that went on but the Seventh Seal you can't put anything up there it's disappeared but it's being made known amen and where's it disappeared out in you all that drawings is all disappeared where's it disappeared it's disappeared in your revelation this whole seventh seal is about you not about this one than that one and the other one and this is happening and this one coming back and this one this this and that and this and the other everybody's waiting on the third pool third polls are opening of the word if it's not opening to you then you're on the admit in the second pool yet okay let's just be that's what means brother clock were talking about last night everybody screaming third pool third pool they can't get out of the second pool they can't get out the first pool some of them that was a healing campaign they can't get out of that the third pools not the healing campaign the third polls the opening of this seal right here the opening of the word amen it's not carnal reform carnal reform is laying on of hands and all those other things we've been through all that hey ma'am I'm just telling you what brother Brown said so look let's get number one a break he breaks the seal so now we know one thing's for sure he's the only one can break the seal reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited now we all know that but some of you that our brother John and sister my back with us for at least for one day I really wish we could lock them up and and keep him here but sister mice she said something about going back home so Oh blame her I'm not gonna blame brothers you animal blame her but but we were on the seals when they were hit last time but we're on number seven now but this inheritance that Jesus inherited remember he inherited eternal eternal life in his body all right his body was not redeemed until it was changed okay all right and it was not eternal now it is eternal when he walked out of that tomb he inherited eternal life becoming kinsman redeemer why kinsman redeemer has to be a flesh cuz ah rake flesh kinfolk alright Christ couldn't be our kin Jesus class had to be our kin amen alright because remember Christ is the anointing in Christ could anoint people but when Jesus Christ came on earth as a human being that was our kinsman redeemer we could go to him and he could what he could take back all that that Satan had took away from us he could take that back being kinsmen he inherited eternal life and who is the seal we're going to talk about in just a minute Jesus Christ is the seventh seal we are we're gonna read that in just a minute Christ is the seventh seal alright and freely gives it out to who us so what are you and I we are recipients of whatever he gets that's pretty simple but we are recipients we just not really believe that yet we are recipients of this eternal inheritance all right he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping himself he gives it back to what the people me and you that's his love for us all right let's go to the second one I'm gonna try to stay on my notes today number two the breach preach one of these seals the whole thing together now look the whole mystery lays in these seals every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time I noticed the book remember sealed here's remember it was sealed up wrapped up but look what he says it's a book of redemption well so now look so you can't take seal 1 through 6 and say well that was redemption and then the seventh seal something different it's a total plan of redemption remember 7 is completion that completes the whole plan of redemption is that number 7 we went through that number 7 number 7 is God's completed number alright so number 7 and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals now remember we saw it where the seals are open now you can read what's on the pages from Genesis to Revelation a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals now who does that start with now it says a complete plan of redemption but you and I have to reveal redeemed first then the earth actually look hold on us 144,000 then the earth then the foolish virgin white throne judgment and then full Redemption only happens when we walk into that new city all right that's when full redemption is over it's when we walk into that city but remember redemption is over for us here that's why the Bible says in Revelations 10 times shall be no longer you and I have entered it not we're not in a church age we're not in any age at all we're in the bride age just like everybody else just come out but I want you to really see something that they brought the club brought to my attention and I want to read it to you in just a little bit but from Genesis to Revelation a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals oh it's an important time now is it important to you is it important to you or are we just coming to church again that's my question to you is it important all right let's go to number three it's rising a son look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was it the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God now remember during that whole seven or actually it was eight days of those meetings brother Branham hardly raised his voice there was no there was a prayer line on the day of the questions and answers and if you'll read that prayer line he hardly does any discernment he just says God bless you in the name of the Lord bless you look read your book read your still book in the name of Jesus receive your healing he just went in other words what am I saying there was no shouting no no screaming no no great what we would call an anointing but he said it was the greatest anointing he ever worked under and it was a quickening power now what are you and I looking for we're looking for a quickening power to where we do like the Joe is we we get up and we we gonna do that you'll fall asleep bro Joe's coming out of that building not the ace I told him to keep this thing on cuz we coming out here we gonna walk around we're gonna find Jesus today alright but look the quickening power of God is when God quickens the word to you not your neighbor not brother day on my brother way when God quickens the word to you that's why we keep asking even brother Dale where is your experience can you actually go back and find out where you were justified know where you were sanctified know where you received the new birth know that God has worked on your life for no micariff you've been in the mentioned 50 years of 15 minutes if you got the new birth you're that 11th hour worker that come in right now today and you get just as much as those people that I told them many times before here we are with brother down we got brother all the different ones just went on and you got brother Howard Carol and different ones that I mean they just paid the road for us us young preachers we should be I'm not young by no means but I'm a young preacher but by no means should we have to have all this garbage in front of us they went through the garbage they blazed the trail they've cut back all the unbelief where we should have a free Road to where we just take it right on to the coming of the Lord amen so we ought to thank God that that we are now at the end time when everything is coming apart out there but it's coming together in here all right here's the one who opened those seals he is those sails now look so if you open a seal and if you see the seals and if you talk about the seven seals you got to talk about Christ and Christ is the seals that was open not the Antichrist it exposed the Antichrist but it revealed Christ what is the opening of seals then revealing Christ number one number two number three number four five number six and number seven is revealing of Christ because if you didn't have Christ on the first seal who opened the first seal to the Prophet brother branham the seventh seal did Christ open that seal brother Brahm didn't open seal Christ opened the seals the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open everybody alright with that say Amen so now let me ask you a question you say oh well the seals were were there tonight in the other let's narrow it down narrow it down today we're going to narrow it down what is the opening of the seals revealing Christ all right let's go to the next Scripture Colossians 1 verse 26 we've read this a million times even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations now what is happening Paul is standing in a position and he's looking back through the Old Testament because remember he's writing the New Testament hey he's not even gotten you know there's not even search agent just barely started when he wrote Colossians amen all right so what's he doing even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now it's made manifest to his Saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man that's what we've been doing for 50 years since the prophets left and teaching every man and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus so where's the Seventh Seal today oh it's brother Branham coming back artist 10 oh it's this boat all right this plane all right we made it no I'm sorry Satan has made it everything but the truth the truth is the Seventh Seal is you if it don't open to you and if you don't manifest if we don't take a body change then this thing is totally wrong brother Branham wasted his time but we know he did because that was the voice of God speaking to me and you and you and I are now commissioned to carry this thing on amen the same voice though not another voice not another doctrine not another denomination there's more denominations in this message and they are out there in the world but how can there be if it's the voice of God just what a million brother clock worked on them you see the voice of God written on a book right it used to be called voice of God recording or I guess it is now used to be spoken word now it's voice of God really really and they tell you to stay home and less than the state that ain't divorce the guard folks you hear me that ain't the voice of God that's the voice of a man but the voice of God will tell you to do what that Bible says regardless of anything else it will tell you to do what the Bible says because Christ is the seals Christ is the word in Christ is for in you so how can you say something different in that chain of command you can't you can't alright let's go to Matthew they say this is revealing Christ and what was the mystery the mystery the mystery was Christ in you the hope of glory that's the great mystery now Jesus is telling them after this isn't Matthew 24 right it's amongst right at the end of the seals remember he's not speaking of the seventh seal but watch what he says and except those days be shortened there shall be no flesh there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened we're fulfilling that Scripture that's me and you I'm gonna get to something in just a minute there's some script listen folks there's some scripture in this Bible that's not to you there's some scripture in this Bible is to you and everybody else there scripture in this Bible that's just to you only and nobody else we got to find the ones that are to us and nobody else all right for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout in the voice who is that - that's to you that's to no-one else you no one heard the shout no one else heard the voice except you're not done you say throw away all the other scriptures no I didn't say that but you got to read the ones this to you brother Brown said a present-day truth a present-day revelation they didn't have that revelation even when brother Branham was here of the shout in the voice in the Archangel really no they didn't there was no resurrection in brother Browns ministry now I'm talking bout no resurrection I'm talking about big regulation not just resurrection of the Dead and then there wasn't that's now look then if any man shall say unto you lo here is the seventh seal are there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders I mean come on people that what we're living under great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect jesus said behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shines even to the west so shall also the coming of the Son of man be how are you gonna know where Christ is if he's in you you know where he is if he's in you you don't have to if someone comes you said well you need to go so-and-so Church they got this doctrine that you need to believe well you know what if you got the Holy Ghost inside of you it'll say know some new doctrine come up and if it's not true what's that Holy Ghost supposed to do it protects the word but it protects you because you're part of the word and then that's what we have to do we have to look for the protection of the words but look nobody you know when that light is where you know you say well it comes from over here it came from over here that same wave you know we're a mystery we are the hidden mystery from the beginning of time is that there's a bride standing on this earth with all this junk going on all these things going on in politics and going on in religion and going on even in this message amen that you and I can understand it and not be rattled not be fearful not be wandering back and forth that's what they did in the wilderness they wandered over here they wandered over there amen that's what you and I are doing we're not wandering in the wilderness we're wondering whether it's so-and-so is right or whether this one's writing hurt some things brother Claude told me that his brother told him though if anybody wants to know it and private I'll not say it out loud but my heaven I can't believe messy people or preaching what they're preaching I just cannot believe it well yeah I guess - because roll that back down for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall grow show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now Jesus is talking that's red letters babe that's talking to me and you hey man that's red letter I didn't put that red letter there that's in the Bible in red letter that's Jesus talking everybody got it up maybe I understand but if Christ in you he can't be if it's the real if it's Christ it can't be false can't be false all right but there shall arise false Christ's and show great signs and wonders and so much that if are possible they shall deceive very late all right let's look at number four now what is the Seventh Seal here we go to what we were we were going back to what the seal is we must remember that the seventh seal is the end of time of all things that's right the things written in this have a sealed book sealed up of the white plan of redemption I want that to go over and over in your head if anybody says the Seventh Seal is this or that or the other say does it do does it is it my Redemption is it has something to do with my Redemption I'll listen to you buddy if they don't have anything to do with my Redemption if it's got where it makes this brother this and this brother that and this brother that I don't want it I want to know about to plan a Redemption for me amen and you should say the same thing about you so if somebody comes to you with a false doctrine it doesn't have to do with the plan of redemption get away from it I mean really come on there's no redemption and let's be honest there's no redemption in an airplane or killing a black bear you don't understand what I mean that we need to focus on what God's told telling me and you and man what God is telling us that's the plan of redemption the seals of the plan of redemption this Bible has the plan of redemption in it but now look it every bit ends it is the end now look remember that word end that word in is not like me and you think we said well I'm my life has ended no that's not what that end is because look it said it's the end of the struggling world now is the end of the world no because when we take a body change and we leave here the world's gonna continue to go on actually in the millennium it's gonna go on another thousand years then when we get to the white cone judgment we got a new heaven and a new earth the earth is eternal so it's not gonna pass away so it's not the end it's the end of the what just like I was trying to explain the other day with with with hope back there she didn't die she just became a mama well that ended her life of being without a child right so we got to do the same thing when you became a Christian it ended your life of being a sinner amen so that's the end that we're looking for we're looking for the end of our redemption which is the full possession of our body change that is what we're looking for and you know what let me add one in here it's the end of death death has been destroyed even Paul tells us death where's your strain it's been great for you victory it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of the struggling nature it's the end of everything and there's the end of the trumpet's because you know what the end of the trumpets is when God goes to the Jews and the seven trumpets open under the sixth seal and what happens Christ comes and takes 144,000 and takes them in a rapture amen so that's the end of the 144,000 but remember that's just their beginning I've been 244,000 eternal ones alright it's the end of everything so remember let's not look and say well brother Brown the seven seals just that's the end you know there's a wall right there at the end no no when it when God brings something to an end it's just the beginning of something else cuz remember it's eternal it's just a circle find find the end of the circle you can't find it but there is a phase you go through because there's an end of this and end of that and the end of this and the end of that listen there should be in the end of you and I struggling struggling with our salvation that's what brother Dale's trying to teach us right now is the end of our struggling of our salvation then God can take us on up the Statue of a perfect man then God can speak to us more and more but if you sit there worrying every day I gotta do something about it he's laid to plan out I mean you couldn't do no more than write it on that wall Ron did you put that there hey yeah hey I got where's the stick at it's the end of the trumpets that's the end of the symbol it's the end of the vials it's the end of the earth now see it's the end of the earth but it's not the end of the earth like we think it's the end of the earth and then so let's don't look at that word in like abrupt stop it's my brother now said that even brother mode I think was teaching her brother Dale was teaching the end of one step it's the beginning of another you in this step now what is that step that step if this step is built on top of that bottom step so this ends this step and begins this one but when you get on this step it ends this one and begins this one alright so that's the way God is because God never how can an eternal God bring something to an abrupt end AJ and when they sin God it just keeps going and going and going alright now that will be an end of sinners there'll be an end of a sinful world what see that's not part of God anything it's not part of God we'll have it in but Christ can't have it in that's wife is inside of you you can't have an end and then it's the even the end of time time runs out but now look time runs out for me and you but not for the Jews so they've got 1260 days they've got to be brought to salvation then in the Millennium you've got 1,000 years of daylight dark daylight dark you see what I'm saying but we are not we are eternal creatures right now we just got to get this thing to catch up with what's inside and when we do that then time will run out for us that's the Seventh Seal when the Seventh Seal produces itself it's Christ back on earth in human flesh all those times where we were preaching on the I am and all these different things where you can say I and my father are one I came from God I go back to God that's what that said one said it was it was telling you that that's what we're coming to we're coming to a realization that that's who we are but you hear me it's not an event do you know what the Seventh Seal is y'all wind up we don't do it now but y'all line up and if you want to see the Seventh Seal I'll put the chart back right here but everybody's born again come stand in front of it that's the Seventh Seal is your life standing there what's your life in Christ is because it's Christ in you the hope of glory right so you're bringing Christ revealed but remember it's a secret to everybody else try to explain your crazy life to somebody else how many times have you tried to explain your heart to somebody else what the Lord's done for me and they go yeah right sure right well that's a mystery but until but now what if you can get Christ in them then they got a story then thank God they say oh yeah I believe that well let me tell you about my experience it just keeps going on and on amen so it's the end everything runs out in this time the end of the end of this seventh seal all rights go to number five I'm sorry let's read that notice this the end of the church age it's the end of the seven seals because remember what is the seven cells Redemption when you come to a body change your redemption is over now not the world and not the 144,000 but yours that's what I'm telling you you need to find the scripture that pertains just to you because you're reading revelation is not about two witnesses that's not to you we can glory that they are a product of when we leave but that's not to you that 1260 days I'll promise you you don't want to be here during that time so that's not to you set that aside that's not to you Lord we glory that there's going to be 1260 days sermon to the Jews but you're getting yours now if you miss it now you're not going to get it over there because that part of the scripture is not to you you got to find the scripture that is to you alright number five and in Sabino Canyon says this is the third pole now he's on the Seventh Seal he's talking about the Seventh Seal this is the third pole then there's three great things that goes with it one unfolded today that's what he was preaching on or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but I was standing right there look and this is the third poll coming up now what is the third poll the opening of the word it's the catching of the big trout go back to the vision it's the catching of the big trout remember the bait on the hook was the healing campaign but it wasn't the hook that caught the bait doesn't catch the fish it attracts it to the hook that you hide that hidden mystery you hide in flesh that's what catches the trout it's the hook that catches the trout not the bait now the bait attracts it you've got to have bait to get to it but we've had many times bait stolen brother Danny did we catch any fish from Matt no but when we hid the but when we hid the hook when we hid the hook and made the fish take it and eat it and it caught that rainbow trout all right so now he was standing a look this is the third pole coming up the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent just shows it's from God now we're gonna get to that just a second about the shout in the voice it's from God for it fits exactly in the promises of God form from from the end of the message and notice notice now for the end of time message you and I are under the end of time message and man this is the only message you're going to get this is that after all he's revealed all the six seals but don't say nothing about the seventh remember there's no symbol and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible now it'll be a total secret but remember we go back to the mystery if they're revealing if revealing Christ is the seventh seal and Christ in you as the sea is the mystery that where's the mystery lay it lay you please realize that and I'll promise you it'll take care of all this confusion of all these other things that needs to happen that we think needs to happen yeah I'm only concerned with what's happening to me and you I'm not concerned with all this other stuff I'm concerned with what's happening inside of you and inside of me because let me read your scripture this real plain and simple have you read this before yeah we just read it a couple of Sundays ago with my Sunday but look let me go back to that quote just a minute ago rent the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret so it's not for everybody it's not for it's not for all the bride it's only for the body change the group that's gonna take a body change those that have went on and passed on and they're enter in the grave and no they're not in the grave forget that Lord stop it they're not the graves they're sitting over there waiting on us in the sixth dimension waiting on us to get off and on and then so they're waiting on us what they've come to their part they've come to their perfection amen but somebody's got to come to the perfection here and draw them out of the grave it'll be a third Pole I'll promise you that it'll be a pull cuz it's gonna pull them right out of that grave amen so this message look this message around the world is a total secret tried it and really go take this message to the White House go take this message to your neighborhood Church it's a mystery they don't believe it so why are you sitting here so why are you sitting here oh you believe it right it's just as plain as day to us you know why it's plain cuz what's this for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we take your Bible in circle that word we because that's talking about no one but you that's not even talking about Paul now we Paul became of a we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord now what coming of the Lord is that see the denomination is gonna read this and they're gonna say oh that's got to happen you know when we see Christ coming from spread the eastern skies and he's gonna come walking down you know and and he's gonna come and get us left behind go watch that movie now the whole world thinks it's a great movie and it's right in line with their denomination lined is why it's wrong you miss the ripe tree you're not gonna get a second shot they get a second shot cuz it's that Left Behind thing now if you left behind you gonna be left behind alright my brother Dale said the other day is weaken a lot of people in plead ignorance you can't plead ignorance in this church you've been told all the mysteries that's what me and Klaus been talking about you've been told all the mysteries you've been given to full seven-course meal now what do you believe it or not that's your business but you've been given you can't plead ignorance you can't plead you can't sit there and look off on the wall somewhere and say I didn't hear that no you heard it if your a lot if you're not asleep you heard it boy you better woke up that's coming after you I just didn't want you to fall out in the floor or was that that we which are alive and remain we which are alive and remain until the coming of Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord Himself that's a personal pronoun the Lord himself shall descend from heaven - who - you to the Wii to the Wii with a what a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first that's why I said brother John I'm not looking for a rapture I forgot that rapture just in the event that's coming right there's got to be a resurrection first there's got to be a body change second then there's a rapture and the rapture happens only because the first to happen first so you can preach I'll see you in the rapture and all these other things that's okay that's alright you say that don't do wait with a song some people get so dogmatic about other things I'm not saying that I'm just telling you though why focus on a rapture Satan would love for you to focus on the rapture that Left Behind thing but I want to focus on what the dead in Christ shall rise first then circle that word again we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together there's the rapture the remember the word rapture is not even in the Bible and then but now the resurrection sure is and the body change sir is to wit the redemption of the body right Romans 8 I want to read that to that brother sometime I fell back to Romans 8 said to wit the redemption of the body don't tell me there's not enough redemption for the body it's in the Bible they will eat you are alive endure then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together we shall be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with law remember we meet him there so brother Brad was going to tell us in his descending he does these three things now remember we were talking about this couple of Sundays ago it's not that God is up there descending down so that we can see him the Lord himself shall do sin now remember he descended on the day of Pentecost went in 120 people and he didn't leave he's still here but he's descending in the word that we hear he's descending how can you do I looked up the definition of descent that means to go from a higher form to a lower form well what's he doing he's descending from a form we can't understand to a form we can't understand now what's the form that you and I can understand thank you sister Christ in you I can understand when I see lie brother Dell said this morning you're Christian because you act like Christ so what do you see you see Christ do you see the person no you see Christ that's the mystery then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words and that's what we do every Sunday and every Wednesday and every time we want to we match play but that scripture look is specific to me and you that's not to the first church age that's not to the second church age that's not to the third church age of the fourth of the fifth of the six and not even really to the seventh search age that's to you and me because you and I are the only one that's going to hear the shout we're the only one that's going to have the voice of the resurrection and we're the only one brother Brown said the Trump always gathers two people together he said to us that's for the marriage supper okay so that takes us right to the marriage supper of the lamb we've already went through a resurrection of body change and being caught up right there then Williams reliable remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord and there let's go the rapture message number six now I want you to notice a great thing taking place here don't miss this see notice the word says here in 2nd Thessalonians that there's three things notice in it strange there was three things in the opening of the seventh seal now there's three things in the descending of God there was three things in the sixth seal the open all right so three is what perfection notice from the 13th to the 16th birth there is three things that has to happen for the Lord himself appears now remember he will never appear in a body form on the earth until the Millennium right so who's he going to appear in yo sorry okay I can keep you awake screaming at you you and brother Larry brother Larry's got his earphones in I mean as the earplugs in so it just muffles it doesn't take the sound away just muffles the sound right that's right and that's all right with me that's okay ain't got a problem with that at least he stays awake but quickly now we can cluck so we can close same we're here notice a shout of voice of trumpet let's read now for Lord Himself sick things first shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel Trump of God three things happen a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears remember he does not appear in body form her brother branham said that he would become so visible among us that he would change us and we're going to rapture right I'll bring that quote next Sunday Jesus does all three of them when he's descending now where's he descending from not from heaven even Moses told the people a long time ago he said he's not in heaven he's Navi even in my mouth the word of faith you preach you got to bring this thing personal I'm telling you folks and I'm just gonna be really honest with you what club says I'll be really honest with you that means I'm not gonna like it we have come to this far in this message and we've got so many Catholic ideas till it's horrible brother Dale pray for my kids brother Dale save my kids brother Dale take care of all my problems I think you need to do the own prayer because he didn't descend now sure now look he's got to descend in the ministry first because we're first particulars of the but you you part of that brother branham does a bride have a ministry yes and it's going on right now a man three things a shout voice of trumpet now Jesus does all of them when he's descending a shout what is the shout all right brother branham he's gonna take this big dance a shout now what is it it's the message he narrows it down it's the message going forth first the Living bread of life bringing forth who the bride who are you thank you three things happen a voice a shout has to happen before Jesus appears he does all these strings as descending alright let's go to the next quote number seven rapture message the first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven now remember what is heaven heaven is the word - where's he descended from he's descending from the word he's always been in the word he's just stepping forth - Shh hey shout got your attention but what happened look you were you were going through life and then all of a sudden that was a shout now I didn't get well yeah I got shouted up by my mama but most of you did - most of you did - okey-dokey then so anyway but we didn't hear a physical shot what you hear you heard a message you heard something you'd never heard before you had heard something that that that tweets your attention than you went where'd that come from I thought how was the Christian I thought I already had it you just didn't know right yeah but that shot wasn't a physical hey but it was so profound though that it turns you like brother Dale said you were going in this direction and that thinks that shout coming you turn and you didn't go what no you do that well somebody men on it but you didn't do that you didn't go you start going back with no you turn and start headed toward that shout you headed toward that message the first thing is a shout so it's got to be the message to get the people together that's why you gathered here today you didn't gather here because it was lula georgia or because brother Dale is the preacher you gathered here because you knew the message was going to come forth from somebody and that you were going to share the message with somebody right here in this sanctuary all right so a message to get the people together a message come forth first what lamp trimming time now what is that that was the part of the message that brought you to the lamp trimming time you know what you still even though you might have been a Christian in a denominational Church which you could I'm not arguing with you but you still when you came to the message you still had to what there was one thing you quit trimming it was one thing you quit driven that was your hair sisters a man though you might have been walking in this direction and everything is no game but something turns you and said hey it's wrong to do that rise and trim your lamps what watch was it the seventh watch not the sixth the seventh behold what behold a shout behold the bridegroom cometh now remember the Bible says the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom will not be heard in her anymore talking about the denominational world in the old mother horn that will read that next Sunday says rise and trim your lamps what in this seventh watch which is who you and I and they did some of them found they didn't have any oil in their lamp that's the foolish virgin that's the people that have struggled through all these years and not have been talked correct how to get the new birth because remember foolish virgins don't have the new birth so somewhere alone and they were justified and sanctified and nobody could take him on to the baptism of the holy ghost in their soul it could have been an anointing thank god brother branham taught us about it only one but it's lamp trimming time all right let's go to the next one what does the shout mean the shout means an order a command specifically a stimulating cry huh either that by which animals are roused and urged on by man as horses by charioteers hounds by hunters are that by which they signal is given to men a signal was given to us by a prophet and said here is God exactly you want to I was just gonna say Frieda said come out of her my people that's exactly what it was that was the shout the shout was come out of her my people now her face as red as a dress is that you but she but yeah she but you said you didn't this morning anyhow you know they I thank God for these people that if these brothers and sisters that we walked with when we were a little kids and now they're all made a circle around and and and come back in there in our age and and being good solid Christians you know you you it wasn't it wasn't then just a poster on the wall it wasn't just a picture on the wall a lot of people were just a picture on the wall you know what I mean about brother branham's just a picture on the wall but now it's not it's become something in our heart it's become a life it's become something God's give us and thank God God give us time thank God he didn't cut this thing off in 1965 how many of you in 1965 were even in this message maybe brother Hal maybe sister Church see in 1965 no and see what I mean rest of us is what dead we were dead dead in trespasses and sins then the denomination we were dead somewhere but see God's give us time right the gods give us time to bring this thing together but now look he's long-suffering but remember there's a time that he's going to bring an end to this thing so you and I are gonna have to get off and on and start doing we just gotta get stay working stay working a signal given to men to rowers by the master of a ship to soldiers by a commander with a loud summons or trumpet call because remember a long time ago you didn't have cell phones the different ones that they it was tones and and ringtones and things that you heard with your ear you had a you had a man on the wall you had a porter you had a watchman in the tower hey there's somebody coming well you know the one that was a shout to get everybody's attention to get the attention of the people well that's what brother Branham came to this earth to do was to get us not to get our attention on him but to get our attention on Christ and what Christ is doing for you and me amen now look let's see number eight mmm-hmm the rapture message now first thing is the sounding first thing is the trumpet and he gets a little confused here let's go back a shout the voice of trumpet shout is a messenger getting the people ready now who's the people me and you remember this shout voice in Archangel it's not going to happen but the one group of people the second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice now look not a different voice the same voice that ain't allowed voice in Saint John 11 38 to 44 that called Lazarus from the grave remember brother Branham I'll bring it to you next Sunday brother Branham said if Jesus would have said everyone come forth they would have come out of the grave he said he said Lazarus to bring one man out but I'll promise you that won't happen anymore this voice of the resurrection is for those dead saints that are in the other dimension that's going to come into this dimension because look it says getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next what was a trumpet voice shouting trumpet now the third thing is the trumpet we'll cover that later on which always at the Feast of Trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky see because when we start getting the Feast of Trumpets which brings everybody together for a feast the Jews down here in this on this earth is getting their trumpets the seven trumpets they're getting because the seven trumpets are not to us but the feasts of the Trump is is to us it's a gathering come together right the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride so what's the next thing we're looking for so you don't look at me cross-eyed when I say I'm not looking for a rapture but he's not either he's preaching the rapture message but he tells us look the first is the message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride now who brought Lazarus from the grave Jesus Christ God in human flesh brought Lazarus out of the grave the Son of Man brought Lazarus out of the grave what ministry are you and I under right now the Ministry of the son of man Christ back again not in one flesh william branham but in all the flesh of the bride of Jesus Christ amen there's a seventh seal but see nobody wants to talk about it because what's this great thing going on Wow do you think you got something yeah yeah I do I've got what everything he told me I guys amen romans 8 says where errors and joint-heirs with Christ believe it the next thing is resurrection of the sleeping Brides the ones died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky while that's the thing that take place friends so what are we looking for the message to call us together has this message already called us together yes calling us now together now the problem is like me and brother Clark we're talking about how can you call the bride together under all these different doctrines that's not the voice of God but there if somebody is going to have to come together under the voice of God not the voice of so-and-so or brother so-and-so or sister so and so or this so-and-so or that so and so God's not that confused this message is not that confused Amen it is not but what's this let's read them now the first thing comes forth ain't go back then the next thing is resurrection of the sleeping bride yeah once died bucking the other agents they're called together and the trumpet the feast in Heaven's in the sky well that's the thing it takes place we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the Esso in to Robin that's been our fifty year journey or sixty year journey almost since the prophets died it's what lay before the Esso end we've made it lay before somebody else but we got to lay before the Esso end to what to ripen alright let's go the next quote now watch this right here godless evil age that's a good message for y'all to read if you got time you listen only to one voice my sheep know my voice and a stranger they'll not up what is his voice any man's voice is his word so what is the voice it's his word and this is it the Bible not one word to be added to it are taken from it just stay right with that voice a stranger they won't follow a denomination might I add a little bit to that a false doctrine listen how can the Holy Ghost send you to a false doctrine you can't have a pure lead you to impure now you can have an impure doctrine and lead you to pure but you can't have a pure you can have the Holy Ghost and it leads you to evolved doctrine now listen folks you say well what about Luther Wesley God winked at there ignatow there was God had not descended to them in that form that he's descended into us now if you got that he descended to Luther and the just shall live by faith Luther was over here drinking a beer and smoking a pipe in a pub he was a German but that was his message God winked at the ignorance of that man being a Trinitarian and baptizing the name of Father Son Holy Ghost but you come through the next one got a little bit better than you come through the Pentecostals to come with the gifts and all that then you come into the oneness then you come into the baptism name Lord Jesus Christ then you got the message they tied up all those loose ends and brought us what see look brother branham had to God through William Branham had to bring all the loose ends together and then bring his message that's our problem we major on the minor the minor was two loose ends kinda the minor was the healing campaign the minor was all that the major is what we're bringing now the major is the opening of those seven seals to change our body without it there was no one else no other messenger except Jesus Christ himself that's why the son of man ministry has to be here as pure as it was on the face of the earth in AD 30 to change our body called this the only thing he's changed is you know what changed his body the word you know what's gonna change your body the word not something happening not something my print on this board up here gonna be something for you you listen to only one voice what does that mean let's go let's see now what we got we went from shout to voice let's see what voice is right here real quick voice is a sound or B noised abroad and noise a sound a tone of inanimate things as musical instruments but watch this right here a voice in other words the sound of uttered words there's the voice the sound of uttered words not false listen we now live under the voice of God not a voice the voice the voice of God is to get our bodies ready for a change and it's right there in the scripture is not a new Bible that had to be written we just got to take the prophets message and lay it right in that Bible and I'll guarantee it'll fit you just got to believe listen to this watch this you don't know why Thunder is next quote somebody live voices and voices the voices what's this all right here was voices oh how we need in Lulla Georgia thousands of lived voices the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish brother Branham who are you talking about he's how much you yes sir real Christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't count how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much can you do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil thousands of lived voices this message is absolutely no good without you and me it's got to be someone speak it and someone receive it and becoming and God never speaks a voice without somebody to respond to he does not cast his pearls before swine's he does not what he does not have a word return void you and I can set up here and we can talk and just stuff about you know work and all this stuff that's just junk but when God speaks to us there's got to be a speech and a reception amen so that's what you and I are we are now thousands of live voices the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled bodies walk around earth today without a blemish that's 1961 before the seals open see that that's the thunder that shakes the devil number 11 we got two more living and twila thing and God has promised to meet the need of the hour all right he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time we're living in remember what I said about scriptures there's certain scriptures that means exactly you you personally God wrote that scripture knowing you would read it and be part of it right here well that ought to shake you that ought to shake you spoon right out of the bowl Aaron and after he has promised that we can rest assured that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need and today one reason that the church is in the condition that it's in is because there is so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of God till it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it spoke right in their myths well let's don't let that happen to us let's don't let that happen to us they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be foreign to them they have got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day let's don't be that way and if we notice in our scripture reading that the voice of God was foreign to them you know you see many times in the Bible you saw Paul got knocked down by light and God spoke to him but all they heard around him was noise when Jesus went remember when God thundered down to Jesus and remember even when brother Branham was standing there in the in the canyon on that rock and the in the whirlwind came down now buddy them guys got under under cars and got hid behind rocks and hid everywhere and here's brother I'm standing right in the middle of it he didn't have one scratch on him but you know what happened they didn't hear all they saw was rocks and noise member brother Brown said that was the angel telling me that judgment would strike the west coast see there was a voice in that like like in job there was a voice out of that whirlwind all that stuff now remember you take eli jie elijah he heard the thunder he saw the lightning he saw all these different things but did he move no he only moved when that still small voice of god said go out to the end of the cave I got something I want to take you remembered Elijah was so lousy Wow jiwoo I'm the only one left in Israel they ain't nobody serving you God but me God said come on out here stand right here at the end of the cave he said there 7000 that I've got hid away that believed the same message you do brother Brown said they believed the same message you do so quit that lousy while you of stuff but it's foreign to people for the voice of God was foreign to them let's don't let the voice of God be foreign to us and it's become that way again today that the voice of God there's so many other voices and then if God promised he would give us that and if other voices are contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us and that's our problem that we would not understand the voice of God when it spoke well that's a wonderful powerful quote right now that is a powerful quote alright let's go to the net number 12 uniting time and son what do you say in Malachi 4 would restore restore back the original Pentecostal faith back to the people with the same Pentecostal message saying Pentecostal sign same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power same teaching everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillow fire struck Paul down the road now look he's showing all these vindications hmm all these external things but now remember that uniting is a secret your marriage to Christ is a secret what we see the nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the churches uniting we see the bride uniting what uniting with the word why the word is God and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being to hear remember there's got to be the receptor they come together in a union they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding and they become one the word becomes you now it he didn't say part of it the word becomes you and you become the word Jesus said that that day you know what all the father is I am and I'll I am you are and all you are I am and that day you'll know that I am the father father in me I and you and you and me see at that day what day so there's you another scripture that you can say that one for this one to that one for the other that's for us today we find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed oh how I like that so the word is the voice of the day and where is that word is in the bride right now watch let's go to the next one we read this and lesson under this read this and then we'll finish the rising of the Sun I like this sir I love this message now notice this quickening power Zoe bringing the word the mind that was in Christ wasn't you then I'm trying to show you that you when you raved when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you also when we gonna start believing the Prophet he raised up you also and also quickened to life with him you are now quickened to life although then you were but an attribute in his thought what when God came out of the grave when Jesus Christ came out of the grave you were an attribute you wasn't a person you were an attribute in that man although then you were but an attribute in this thoughts but God had saw all in him at the end seventh seal at the end when God looked upon the body the spirit left him in the garden again cemani had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh man if he had had went up there as God he'd have never died that kind of death we know the spirit left him so he could die okay can't kill God but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you him see God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female back to the same thing in the beginning with Adam when he looked at at him he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one buddy see they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speak of the bride so you read these great things that happen to our Lord Jesus and remember that your prophet said that whatever speaks of him speaks of you that's why you and I can do it we can be the I am cuz he told us we could be we can be the one that came from God the one who went back to God we can be there because he told us that's what we are she is him what we gonna believe that when we see that happening we'll take a body change let's stand our feet musicians come at same boys they brought Lazarus from the grave if that's what he spoke of him he's hey he's the bridegroom amen he's the bridegroom and we're the bride we were in him when he said Lazarus come forth when he told Martha or Mary whichever one he said I am the resurrection and the life you and I were in him and represented in him at that time when did we go and start believing that let's sing a song praise the Lord [Music] [Music] number 7 41 3 48 48 348 no finish problem show this light around that I
