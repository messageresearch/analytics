[4:04] once before and they've invited me and
[4:05] Janet to go up there and share a story
[4:07] and I said well

[4:13] this God did this and so I could I'm
[4:16] going to say that and go to Las Vegas
[4:24] I'm just thank you I met a couple guys

[6:26] Revelations 13.
[6:29] we're trying to continue home with these
[6:32] things I hope you're enjoying maybe some
[6:35] of the things that you've forgotten over
[6:37] all of the years that you used to study
[6:39] about and go back and study over them
[6:41] again you know and fall into the Book of
[6:43] Revelations it's really been helpful to
[6:46] me to uh you know go back and review a
[6:49] lot of things and see what we used to
[6:51] talk about uh you know back in the in
[6:55] the late 60s and early 70s we used to
[6:57] talk about the Book of Revelations a lot
[6:59] so you know I I really like to go back
[7:02] and look at it all right
[7:04] now we have a special announcement
[7:07] tonight
[7:09] the Lord willing this coming Sunday
[7:12] afternoon
[7:14] brother Bob black will be preaching yes
[7:16] for a sermon amen
[7:23] mating on his
[7:26] leaving column in his life and we talked
[7:28] about it and I told him to run like
[7:31] crazy and you know until the Lord ran
[7:33] him down and then the Lord could use him
[7:35] and until he tried that a little and he
[7:38] said
[7:39] Sunday that he was ready to go so the
[7:41] Lord willingness coming Sunday he will
[7:44] be preaching his uh first Sunday I mean
[7:48] for service and then probably the next
[7:51] weekend we will have the ordination
[7:54] because that will be when brother Bob's
[7:57] dad and Mama will be down they'd be
[7:58] watching so that's the advantages of
[8:01] Amen of these now they can that's right
[8:03] they can sit there and cry all they want
[8:06] to
[8:08] and it won't affect him at all
[8:11] they can holler and scream and run
[8:13] through the house and pull their hair
[8:14] out it won't affect him that's really
[8:18] good you know
[8:20] that's right you know sometimes you want
[8:23] to look around and you want to do that
[8:24] yourself but anyhow we'll do that the
[8:27] Lord willingness this Sunday
[8:30] and also now remember this is the last
[8:32] time to be able to sign up for the
[8:33] banquet because we've got to be able to
[8:35] order the food so if you don't try it at
[8:37] night don't come tomorrow you know
[8:39] because we're done uh having everything
[8:42] catered and all and fixed and we you
[8:45] know we will have that done okay
[8:47] remember two now the Lord willing this
[8:49] coming Wednesday
[8:51] which will be the what I wrote it down
[8:55] somewhere but really be the 13th my
[8:57] brother brother Tom Ernest will be with
[8:59] us preaching the Wednesday night service
[9:01] so remember that
[9:03] any other announcement I generally
[9:05] forget something
[9:06] that you know I don't know if I told you
[9:10] Amy Jefferson later in the morning
[9:12] they're inducing labor on tomorrow Amy
[9:17] tomorrow okay so that's uh we'll be kept
[9:20] in touch with that you know
[9:23] we're pretty good at doing some of those
[9:25] things because I had to pick a baby calf
[9:27] up yesterday and carry it up the bank
[9:30] and I guess it's yesterday or day before
[9:32] and carried up a bank and it slipped and
[9:35] slimy just with a newborn and so I go
[9:38] down and maybe they'll let me assist
[9:40] them
[9:42] when he helped a little bit at least it
[9:44] cleared up the body I can boil water
[9:47] I'm sure if they're watching that
[9:49] they'll get a good life all right
[9:51] Revelations 1 and Revelations 13. let's
[9:54] pray
[9:55] your lord Jesus we thank you Father for
[9:58] all things and we know and realized it
[10:01] you are God and you change not
[10:04] and that all things are possible with
[10:06] you yes and we just have to believe it
[10:08] we ask you now that you'd be where

[10:13] let it be a short time and everything be
[10:16] okay but we're looking forward to that
[10:18] yes
[10:19] absolutely and we just thank you for you
[10:21] loving your grace unto us in the day and
[10:24] the hour that we're living upon the
[10:25] Earth thank you for touching these that
[10:28] I've been sick among us and bringing
[10:30] them back together and taking care of
[10:32] some of these old colds and things that
[10:34] we've had and just continue to make
[10:36] yourself manifest as the Healer in our
[10:38] bodies in our lives we love you and we
[10:41] thank you now come as we read your word
[10:43] and as we talk about you and this have
[10:47] your way with us forgive our sins
[10:48] because we want to stand complete in you
[10:51] we love you and we thank you in Jesus
[10:53] name amen
[10:56] Revelations
[11:03] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[11:06] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[11:08] things which must shortly come to pass
[11:10] and he said to signify it by his Angel
[11:12] into his servant John who by record of
[11:15] the word of God under the testimony of
[11:16] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[11:19] saw
[11:20] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[11:22] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[11:24] those things which are written therein
[11:26] for the time is at hand
[11:29] all right let's read Revelation 13. one
[11:32] through three we'll probably get too far
[11:34] in it but
[11:36] you know we tried to cover verse one
[11:38] our Sunday but let's read that verse
[11:41] Chapter 13 Verse 1 and I stood upon the
[11:43] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[11:45] out of the sea having seven heads and
[11:48] ten horns and upon his horns
[11:52] ten crowns and upon his heads the name
[11:55] of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw
[11:58] was like unto a leopard and his feet
[12:01] were as the feet of a bear and his mouth
[12:04] as the mouth of a lion and the dragon
[12:06] gave him his power and his seat in great
[12:09] Authority
[12:10] and I saw one of his heads as it were
[12:12] wounded to death
[12:14] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[12:16] the world wondered after the Beast you
[12:19] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[12:21] to the reading of the word
[12:23] no
[12:25] no
[12:26] we have been going you know said coming
[12:30] through this part and I know
[12:34] it takes time and I could spend a
[12:37] greater length of time with just a
[12:39] little parts of notes that I run off but
[12:42] we try not to spend the time we're
[12:44] trying to get a point
[12:46] and
[12:47] that point is that we thank God for the
[12:52] opening of the word in the end times by
[12:54] way of the Prophet messenger amen so
[12:56] that we little uh Beyond
[12:59] beyond all ourselves illiterates
[13:02] uh can read the book of Revelations
[13:06] you know and understand a lot of the
[13:09] things that are there and um and we can
[13:13] Rejoice over it from some of the parts
[13:14] that we when we were you know back in
[13:17] organized religion depending upon
[13:19] Mankind we we would not be able to
[13:22] comprehend these things and to see that
[13:25] a lot of the things that we read of are
[13:27] not the great big scary that's been my
[13:30] point for about a month now is to try to
[13:33] get us to see that the Book of
[13:36] Revelations by the prophet speaking of
[13:39] the symbols
[13:40] then it it's not a great mystery anymore
[13:44] right and and we can see the simple
[13:47] things have already transpired right
[13:49] Among Us right and you know and seeing
[13:51] where we're living
[13:53] and see the hour that we're living and
[13:56] and to me now after being see like we
[14:00] have the most of us into the message for
[14:02] quite a few years and studying these
[14:04] things it's becoming like reading a
[14:06] newspaper
[14:08] you know you can you can just go home
[14:11] sit down get a newspaper and you can
[14:15] read and see these things are
[14:17] transpiring right now in the world right
[14:21] I'm already transpired or will transpire
[14:24] you know and right and it's unfolding
[14:26] it's becoming simple
[14:28] to understand amen and that way then we
[14:32] can see because I'm trying not to just
[14:34] cover what this is but bring it down to
[14:38] where we are
[14:40] remember we split one whole message on
[14:43] trying to get us to look at the fact of
[14:46] a compound meaning of scripture where
[14:48] that we could see these things and read
[14:51] them and realize this is to Israel in
[14:54] the tribulation period like I've told
[14:56] you seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[14:59] thirteen to where we are now all of it
[15:01] is dealing with Israel in a tribulation
[15:03] period amen all right and it's only
[15:05] taking a three and a half year period
[15:08] of time for all of those things
[15:12] to uh take place
[15:15] all right so it's right here right upon
[15:18] us and each one of these things that we
[15:21] see is what I've always tried to get you
[15:23] to look at whatever you're reading in
[15:25] the Bible
[15:27] is to look
[15:29] and and everything don't just drop down
[15:32] all at once that's right
[15:33] that's right you know I mean I mean
[15:35] Russia didn't become communist
[15:39] it was Russia
[15:40] then it became communist the it took
[15:43] quite a while
[15:45] you know all right we we've been through
[15:47] in our lives here in America great
[15:50] changes and great processes that started
[15:54] way back
[15:55] you know hundreds of years ago right and
[15:58] all and it's now unfolding
[16:02] as to seeing it where we're living at
[16:05] now well that's what the Bible is
[16:07] supposed to do
[16:09] he to to find out you know that that the
[16:13] dragon as we've covered through the 12th
[16:15] chapter a lot a little bit this past
[16:16] Sunday that that red dragon
[16:20] is Rome
[16:22] well that's all right
[16:25] we needed to know those things okay
[16:29] but
[16:31] what about you and I man
[16:34] see do we have their same Doctrine
[16:37] we won't get that far tonight on about
[16:39] the image to the Beast if we have time
[16:41] I'll try to cover it right at the end
[16:42] for a little but then we'll go on down
[16:45] into chapter 13 and covering the mark of
[16:48] the beast and things
[16:56] and sitting right in the system right
[16:58] there with the same Doctrine and idea
[17:00] you know
[17:02] and don't even realize it
[17:05] you know and swear
[17:08] to to you know to not be that right yeah
[17:12] and come to find out that's right where
[17:14] we're at what if we find out where we're
[17:16] at we can do something about it and
[17:19] you know you you can't know that a
[17:21] Doctrine is wrong
[17:23] and no matter what kind of a Doctrine
[17:25] trinities or anything you can't know
[17:28] they're wrong until truth is presented
[17:30] amen
[17:31] then once truth is presented then you
[17:34] can look at something and say oh okay I
[17:37] used to believe that
[17:39] but now I don't believe it that way
[17:41] anymore we'll see things have changed
[17:44] right and that's what this message is
[17:46] supposed to do to us
[17:47] open up the word until we can read it
[17:50] with our own glasses as we call it
[17:52] because we used to read it with
[17:53] Methodist glasses Madness glasses you
[17:56] know Presbyterian glasses you say well
[17:59] what do you mean by that I mean just
[18:00] what I said what we look through we only
[18:03] seen what we wanted to see by their
[18:05] Doctrine you know in their doings and
[18:09] things and and we couldn't read no
[18:11] difference out of it
[18:14] but now
[18:16] we know that we took up Sunday bring it
[18:18] in chapter 13. let's get on the end of
[18:21] the appointment
[18:22] that is chapter 13 starts off
[18:27] we see that it's the rise
[18:32] of the Catholic Church
[18:35] here in the United States
[18:40] as a civil and ecclesiastical powers
[18:44] developing here
[18:47] you know
[18:49] and that Rome today
[18:53] the Roman Catholic Church is not trying
[18:55] to conquer by force
[18:58] see because that would be the old Pagan
[19:01] wrong form
[19:03] but the Catholic church is Conquering by
[19:06] religious power amen
[19:09] you know
[19:11] amen their Doctrine their ideas
[19:14] amen now
[19:17] then we'll see when we get to the image
[19:19] of the Beast part that
[19:21] if you make an image to something
[19:25] then the image you're making is
[19:27] identical repeat
[19:29] of what you had the original
[19:33] right or it wouldn't be an image of it
[19:35] it would just be some form of lightness
[19:37] or some idea
[19:40] but when you see that you have the same
[19:42] Doctrine
[19:44] right
[19:45] then you can see that the church has
[19:48] really taken over
[19:54] you know you say well well you know
[19:57] they're not doing any problems with us
[19:59] right now but that may be true
[20:02] you know
[20:04] but that don't mean it ain't on the way
[20:06] that's right
[20:07] you said well how can they force us to
[20:10] do this that or the other
[20:12] yeah
[20:16] they're doing it now around the world
[20:18] Amen that's right if you are not looking
[20:20] at the lady of SIA to see that what
[20:23] lesosia means people's rights
[20:26] and you know that there's hardly a
[20:28] country in the world tonight that's not
[20:30] under
[20:32] um
[20:33] some kind of a
[20:36] Coupe
[20:38] problems you know whether they're out on
[20:40] the streets protesting or or whatever
[20:44] yep you know and these big countries
[20:47] can't do anything with them because if
[20:50] they raise up against them you know
[20:52] they're afraid of them
[20:55] and see then but don't look at the room
[20:57] now that we get into that we've got to
[20:59] see how Hagin Rome
[21:02] becomes power wrong right amen but it's
[21:06] the same identical
[21:09] Doctrine and ideas
[21:11] that's right the old Roman idea if we
[21:14] get down to read it to me was to divide
[21:16] and conquer
[21:19] well that's what it's doing now see
[21:22] divide and conquer
[21:25] you know to see us talking to the
[21:27] chiropractor today while he's working on
[21:30] my back a little bit and he was saying
[21:32] Sam he says if you ever seen the time
[21:33] when people are just not settled
[21:37] he said is there one thing one day and
[21:39] another thing another day and
[21:42] he said there's this some kind of a guy
[21:45] you know said he's he the government now
[21:48] has even hired him to try to figure out
[21:50] how they can help us but he was so
[21:52] contrary he said the article showed that
[21:55] that man was so contrary to us right
[21:58] that he was trying to put lower forth
[22:00] all of these doctrines from the islamics
[22:02] and the you know the al-qaedas all kind
[22:04] of things so now the government's hiring
[22:07] him to help try to help figure us out
[22:11] well it's just compromising amen that's
[22:15] right
[22:17] I mean you look at it today all around
[22:19] the world and everybody's trying to to
[22:22] get some kind of form of compromising
[22:23] idea but now listen
[22:26] what would we talking about our Sunday
[22:29] that
[22:30] the 13th chapter of Revelation is a
[22:33] marvelous thing because
[22:36] when the pope come over here to the
[22:38] United States
[22:40] he walked up 13 steps
[22:43] deserve communion to 13 people
[22:47] huh
[22:49] now that was just natural things
[22:50] happening you saw that was just an
[22:52] accident you know like I said you get
[22:54] around to figure on we will in a minute
[22:56] I mean on later on in in the this
[22:59] message or two down to 666 your name
[23:02] could be figured out to be 666.
[23:07] there's two places in the world sets on
[23:09] Seven Hill do you remember we covered
[23:10] that one I'm in Cincinnati but
[23:12] Cincinnati is not a religious ruling
[23:15] Factor nowhere
[23:17] you got to find the church sitting on
[23:19] those Hills so it had to be Rome Italy
[23:21] it's the only thing that that can come
[23:24] forth and America's number is 13. 13
[23:28] stars 13 stripes
[23:30] okay the prophet said and she's in the
[23:34] 13th chapter of Revelation amen all
[23:37] right you say well now okay that's after
[23:39] we leave
[23:41] but the Forerunner is everything's not
[23:44] waiting do we leave this gonna start
[23:46] getting this no it's been building up
[23:51] from the time we came to America
[23:54] and America came into being
[23:57] from guard down to now these things are
[24:00] building up
[24:02] and we came here
[24:06] under the pretense of freedom
[24:09] from religion right
[24:14] right see the religious persecution then
[24:16] you can call it freedom I really
[24:18] really but religious persecution and
[24:21] people came here to try to find a new
[24:23] way and we found it
[24:26] but then now we turn around and give
[24:28] back
[24:30] the things that makes the world be like
[24:33] it was
[24:35] and what are we going to do right why
[24:37] don't you leave America if you don't
[24:39] like it I love it
[24:42] okay
[24:44] I thank God for America
[24:46] for the religious freedom that we still
[24:49] have to this moment right right now all
[24:52] right
[24:53] but getting up to that point now
[24:57] Hagen Rome
[25:00] because we'll get to it just a minute
[25:01] with the scripture
[25:03] Pagan Rome at one time ruled the world
[25:06] right right amen
[25:11] and as it did
[25:14] then the Bible was written
[25:18] to show us these things
[25:21] but
[25:22] why would you write a Bible if it's to
[25:25] be the uh
[25:27] it's to be for them not for the wise and
[25:30] put up to figure out but
[25:32] you know
[25:34] for the children of God to be able to
[25:36] understand amen he said well why didn't
[25:38] they write it out wrong would be this
[25:40] it would be any mystery to it that's
[25:42] right man so then we get into like
[25:44] Revelation 13 we read
[25:47] then you get into what like seven heads
[25:50] ten horns
[25:52] there's no way to draw these things out
[25:56] that's right and to show them right but
[26:00] then to see what they mean
[26:03] and then you can see what's transpiring
[26:05] in life right all right see then you can
[26:09] follow it now you know you'll read of of
[26:13] leopards bear Lions dragons
[26:17] he said well we don't know what that is
[26:19] and then they come along and that's
[26:21] that's the reason I say I appreciate God
[26:23] because see somebody could come along in
[26:25] them anyway could say well I think it
[26:27] means then yeah
[26:29] and brother Mark people said well I
[26:31] think it means that
[26:33] and he could go through and show and
[26:34] wait to go through and show brother
[26:36] colleague and come along so what I shall
[26:37] hear that it's this that line means this
[26:40] the bar means this this means that whoa
[26:44] one opinion's good as another one
[26:48] right right but when you have a prophet
[26:51] to tell you
[26:53] what these things mean right yeah all
[26:56] right Ben it's a settled matter because
[26:58] the prophet is interpreting what the
[27:02] Holy Spirit directed Demand right right
[27:06] yeah right
[27:08] that's right thank God for the crew
[27:11] to be able to stand in the day and be
[27:13] able to read the Bible that I remember
[27:15] when I used to read it as a you know a
[27:18] person in the Baptist Church I'd read
[27:20] and I would try to understand and I'd
[27:22] read any commentary that I could find or
[27:25] school always use a Scofield bible and
[27:28] and I'd always try to follow his
[27:30] footnotes and see what these things mean
[27:32] and and back in the early days when I
[27:35] was reading I could tell you what Daniel
[27:38] better memory then than I have now I had
[27:42] to write it down
[27:43] when I started breaking down these
[27:46] things but in the early days of when I
[27:48] was in the Baptist and reading the Bible
[27:50] myself then I would see these things and
[27:53] and it comes down from the means of
[27:56] Persians the Greeks all of the things
[27:58] coming down right down to Rome
[28:02] yep
[28:03] and Schofield even covers
[28:07] the papal wrong Pagan wrong becoming
[28:10] powerful wrong
[28:12] he had a lot of good footnotes from
[28:13] those times
[28:15] because you could follow the leanings
[28:18] the line
[28:19] but you couldn't follow it in the way
[28:22] that it was supposed to be done
[28:24] now I've emphasized this over and over
[28:27] to you and we'll try to do more of it
[28:29] tonight
[28:31] that
[28:33] the Book of Revelations that we've been
[28:36] reading we've come through now 7 8 9 10
[28:38] 11 12 up into 13.
[28:42] all right
[28:43] it's a continuation of the revealing
[28:49] of things that are transpiring right
[28:52] that's right
[28:54] you see it as I said trying to get you
[28:56] to understand you read Revelations six
[29:00] over there in the sixth heal
[29:02] you know and it doesn't say anything
[29:05] about 144 000. right
[29:09] it doesn't talk of any of those things
[29:12] it talks of earthquakes and things like
[29:16] that we'll see if you're limited with
[29:18] only that thought that's all you can
[29:20] think of
[29:21] even if you could read what the prophet
[29:24] would say that would be what you would
[29:25] have
[29:27] but then the level you know the the
[29:30] seventh chapter comes in to tell you the
[29:32] 144 000. right
[29:35] did seven eight nine you get into the
[29:40] trumpets
[29:42] and all of them sound to Israel
[29:45] yeah
[29:46] see it's a continually opening
[29:51] one makes a way for you understand the
[29:53] next
[29:54] man all right man
[29:57] now I've always tried to get you to to
[30:00] read the book of Daniel
[30:02] because the Book of Daniel is not a
[30:04] whole bunch of dreams and Visions
[30:06] telling many different things
[30:09] is God trying to show Daniel
[30:13] to be able to write
[30:15] then when he gets old over to the nights
[30:18] and all like that he really lays it down
[30:20] that I've come to show you the beginning
[30:22] and the ending
[30:25] but he's already been doing those things
[30:32] he'd already been revealing those things
[30:34] or making them known and then the Book
[30:36] of Daniel
[30:38] you remember we'll read in a minute
[30:41] but you remember Nebuchadnezzar had a
[30:44] dream
[30:47] all right
[30:48] I mean you know that Nebuchadnezzar had
[30:52] a dream of the four powers
[30:54] you know that Daniel
[30:56] in the seventh chapter
[30:59] had a dream of his own
[31:04] of the four powers
[31:09] God just keeps unfolding it
[31:11] unveiling it amen but see what I love
[31:14] about it dependence upon a prophet
[31:17] you know that Nebuchadnezzar's dream was
[31:19] gone from me you remember that
[31:23] right and he called in all of his dream
[31:26] interpreters you know
[31:29] he said tell me what my dream is and
[31:32] they said tell us a dream and we'll tell
[31:34] you
[31:37] he said well it's gone from me
[31:40] well it kept pressure and he pressured
[31:42] him in the Book of Daniel
[31:43] chapter one and going on into two you
[31:45] know go through that man they kept
[31:48] pressuring him and
[31:51] thank you
[31:54] wanting to know what the dream was
[31:56] because you know I I could tell a dream
[31:59] and
[32:01] they don't tell how many interpretations
[32:04] would be had out of you of my dream
[32:09] because I told you my dream right but
[32:12] what if I got up here and said I had a
[32:14] dream
[32:19] tell me the dream
[32:23] what do you mean tell me tell you your
[32:25] dream I can't tell you your dream
[32:30] and I'd say like Daniel did you know I
[32:32] mean like never could answer if you
[32:34] can't tell me what I dreamed how am I
[32:37] gonna know your interpretation is
[32:38] correct
[32:42] see the people would tell if they'd go
[32:45] to brother Branham and they'd tell him a
[32:47] dream they had
[32:49] and he'd say here's your dream even to
[32:52] sometimes writing down before the people
[32:55] got there right right the dream and the
[32:58] interpretation
[33:00] and just hand them the paper because he
[33:02] was running out of time
[33:06] he said that's the way you know whether
[33:08] it was a prophet or not here we go you
[33:10] tell me a dream and I said well you
[33:11] don't want to sound much I want you and
[33:13] that sounds like this and that sounds
[33:14] like it happened
[33:17] you know it might be
[33:20] but right around would tell people you
[33:22] know said why don't you leave this out
[33:24] of your dream
[33:25] s
[33:28] that's right and one brother sure would
[33:30] love to change things because he he was
[33:32] in some riding other horses and the
[33:34] thing back there he'd had a dream and
[33:35] run around and told him to answer to his
[33:37] dream
[33:37] well I'm going to take what wrote around
[33:39] and said about it I don't care what he
[33:41] said he didn't even dream that
[33:43] no
[33:45] because the prophet could tell you the
[33:47] answer and that's what Daniel said
[33:49] they were going to kill these guys
[33:52] the king finally said all right I'll
[33:54] just kill all of you and get me some
[33:55] more dream interpreter
[33:59] So Daniel got the word and he went
[34:01] before the Lord
[34:04] that's right
[34:05] the Lord showed him
[34:08] so when he come over to Nebuchadnezzar
[34:11] he said
[34:13] here's your dream
[34:18] well you know because of
[34:20] being able to do that he was exalted to
[34:23] a great position that's right I never
[34:25] can answer right
[34:26] yep
[34:28] but you know that a lot of times
[34:31] people would ask a profit what a dream
[34:33] was
[34:35] and he would have to tell them even
[34:37] though it was something bad
[34:41] yeah
[34:43] because he could only speak what God
[34:45] gave him right
[34:46] right
[34:47] see and I could tell you a dream and
[34:49] like I said I'd have 50 50 chance of
[34:51] being able to interpret it yeah
[34:53] no I mean wouldn't you you I tell you a
[34:55] drink you can you can make up something
[34:57] and you know and they've got these
[35:00] people that take your dreams and and
[35:05] try to tell you what it all is and
[35:09] you know
[35:11] they said well you dreamed this and then
[35:13] you dream this and you're dreaming this
[35:14] well then we know that there's a pattern
[35:16] here but that's not thus saith the Lord
[35:19] right
[35:21] trying to just go in one day and I'd say
[35:23] I want you all to interpret my dream and
[35:25] they said can we dream I said I don't
[35:26] even remember it yeah
[35:29] well they just put you in next you're
[35:31] right they just say next you know they
[35:34] send you out the door
[35:36] and but God told a prophet
[35:40] Daniel what the dream was and the
[35:43] interpretation that's right
[35:48] see then that way you can look at it for
[35:50] yourself and see let's let's go ahead
[35:52] and let's just go to Daniel 2.
[35:54] you just look at this
[35:58] from the point that we're talking about
[35:59] that Daniel's going to now tell the
[36:01] dream to
[36:04] have a connection didn't give him the
[36:06] interpretation
[36:12] Daniel
[36:13] 235 32 45 is what we'll try to run
[36:17] but it's for me this secret is not
[36:20] revealed to me for any wisdom that I
[36:23] have more than any living
[36:26] but that there are sick but for their
[36:28] sakes
[36:29] that shall make known the interpretation
[36:33] to the current King and that thou might
[36:35] us know the thoughts of my heart in
[36:37] other words where you won't kill these
[36:38] over here and I'm not trying to be
[36:40] involved above them but just right where
[36:43] you won't kill them all right
[36:45] to Thou King saw us and behold a great
[36:48] image
[36:49] this great image whose brightness was
[36:51] excellent stood before the
[36:54] and deformed thereof was terrible
[36:57] now look
[36:58] this image images head was refined gold
[37:01] it rest in his arms of silver in his
[37:04] belly and his ties of rice his legs of
[37:07] iron his feet part of iron and part of
[37:09] clay
[37:11] now watch
[37:15] this is really what I want to preach on
[37:17] but I got to cover the other part
[37:18] because I'm going to go to 34 and 45
[37:20] you'll see in a minute
[37:22] thou shall are still that a stone was
[37:24] cut out without hands
[37:29] now there's what the suit Sayers and the
[37:31] things couldn't cover
[37:33] if they see the the people get what I'm
[37:36] saying the people that could tell you
[37:39] even Scofield could tell you what this
[37:42] iron and clay and the the gold and the
[37:46] Bryce and the things and tell you the
[37:49] people and he does he tells you the
[37:51] exact kingdoms that comes down who never
[37:53] can answer it and see Daniel tells part
[37:56] of the king is the the head of gold he
[37:58] tells it right all right
[38:00] well look what would be left out by
[38:02] mankind
[38:05] because in the time of all of these
[38:08] Kings and things what's going to happen
[38:12] verse 34 thou saw us still that a stone
[38:15] was cut out of cut out without hands
[38:18] which spoke the image
[38:20] All These Little Things
[38:22] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[38:25] and break them to pieces
[38:28] yeah
[38:30] that's the day you and I are living
[38:31] right man
[38:33] in this day
[38:37] we're going to see that
[38:40] this message is that stone right now
[38:43] that's the way I believe it
[38:46] and I mean this message as being the
[38:48] entire Bible to be made known in the
[38:49] last days you understand what I mean by
[38:51] that
[38:54] this message
[38:57] is going to strike the image in the feet
[38:59] look at your drawing of Daniel and how
[39:02] that he's got Daniel up there and it
[39:04] droves and shows a line coming down and
[39:06] hitting that right image standing there
[39:09] in the feet amen because that's where
[39:10] the iron and the clay is that's Jeff and
[39:13] Eisenhower that's in this day
[39:15] right
[39:17] would you think that would be the point
[39:19] that mankind can't totally figure out
[39:22] the other say something's going to take
[39:24] place
[39:26] to watch now what will take place then
[39:29] was the iron to Clay the price of silver
[39:31] and gold broke into pieces together and
[39:34] come back to the shaft of the summer
[39:36] threshing floors and the wind carried
[39:38] them away that no place was found no
[39:41] more for them and the stone that smoked
[39:43] the image
[39:45] we became a great mountain and filled
[39:47] the whole Earth
[39:48] this is a dream
[39:50] and we will tell you the interpretations
[39:52] thereof
[39:54] what
[39:56] before the king and he's going to tell
[39:59] him the interpretation right
[40:01] right he told him to dream
[40:04] and Nebuchadnezzar said that's right
[40:07] it was exactly what I saw
[40:10] now
[40:11] give us the interpretation
[40:14] and the old king or the King of Kings
[40:17] look what God would say about
[40:18] Nebuchadnezzar because he's not making
[40:19] that remember look
[40:24] and Thou King are the king of kings for
[40:28] the god of Heaven hath given to your
[40:29] kingdom power and strength and Glory
[40:34] and whatsoever the children of men dwell
[40:37] speaks to the fields and the files of
[40:39] Heaven had be given into thine hands and
[40:43] that may be ruler over them all Ark
[40:47] this head of gold who was it
[40:52] right
[40:54] Nebuchadnezzar was the one he was
[40:56] talking to
[40:57] all right now
[41:00] verse 39. excuse me
[41:05] I've been doing pretty good
[41:07] I've had four Services
[41:09] all right
[41:10] we don't worry about that
[41:15] and after thee
[41:18] Joe Horizon another kingdom inferior
[41:20] today in other words mushroom you know
[41:23] right
[41:26] and another third Kingdom of brash which
[41:29] will by rule over all the Earth
[41:32] which was Grace under Alexander right
[41:36] right all right now I put these in there
[41:38] you know which was me the person Miser
[41:41] Persian is the kingdom would come in
[41:43] third one which is inferior uh the
[41:45] second one which is inferior the third
[41:46] one is Greece under Alexander one two
[41:49] three make sure you get right
[41:51] and a
[41:54] fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron
[41:58] very much an iron breakfast into pieces
[42:00] and subdue it to all things
[42:03] and as iron that breakth all these shall
[42:06] it break in pieces and Brews all right
[42:08] so what's he covering now
[42:13] he's going to show Daniel
[42:16] that never to measure
[42:19] Daniel's going to show him from there
[42:24] to our day right amen
[42:35] people would try to figure it out
[42:39] and you can't figure it out but a
[42:40] prophet would know amen he's on a show
[42:43] from gar
[42:45] all the way to where we're at amen all
[42:48] right not to just roam down there
[42:51] because he got down to the Ken told
[42:54] him straight
[42:56] you not anyone showed the Roman
[42:59] nation which was see was Nebuchadnezzar
[43:04] the Greeks the Persians and the things
[43:06] coming down Alexander and then coming on
[43:09] down to the Natural Roman
[43:12] government amen
[43:14] all right
[43:16] but it didn't stop there
[43:20] because the dream didn't stop dying
[43:25] that was what I said I wanted to preach
[43:26] that instead of these things but I have
[43:28] to get this out of the way
[43:31] see the the it's all back up there we
[43:34] just read it right out of the Bible
[43:37] the King You've seen
[43:40] until there's going to be a stone cut
[43:42] out of the mountain
[43:43] a stone
[43:45] and it's going to strike the image in
[43:47] the feet
[43:49] and destroy it
[43:52] it's going to bring forth and discipline
[43:56] right amen so he showed him all the way
[43:58] down to where we're at
[44:00] so now natural Rome is with what natural
[44:03] Rome was destroyed thank you man yeah
[44:06] natural Rome was destroyed
[44:10] the Roman government is not in control
[44:12] today right
[44:14] Rome ended
[44:17] me that guy after Calvary
[44:21] the natural Roman government
[44:27] but the Book of Revelation says that
[44:29] that thing is still going
[44:31] Daniel says it's still going
[44:34] and showed it all the way down to where
[44:36] we're at that's my point I want you to
[44:38] get see right because it comes down to
[44:40] iron you know and where is thy sauce to
[44:42] defeat and Co feet and Toes part apart
[44:46] part part of Potter's clay and heart of
[44:48] iron
[44:49] the kingdom shall be divided but there
[44:52] shall be in it of the strength of the
[44:54] iron for as much as thou saw us the iron
[44:57] mix with my reclaim now iron and Clay
[45:00] won't mix so it doesn't mean it's mixing
[45:02] it means they run together right
[45:05] they just go over each other and they
[45:07] get along with each other
[45:09] all right yep right
[45:11] it's not that they see they still both
[45:13] got their
[45:15] uh what would you call it composite of
[45:17] whatever they are one is iron
[45:20] iron won't mix with clay
[45:22] won't mix with iron it won't work
[45:25] right
[45:27] they're going to be there and mingle
[45:29] together
[45:31] until the end
[45:34] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[45:37] iron and part of play show the kingdom
[45:40] shall be partly strong
[45:42] and partly broken now we get on down to
[45:45] a little bit and you'll see
[45:46] and whereas thy sauce iron mixed with
[45:50] Myra clay they shall mingle themselves
[45:52] with the seed of men
[45:55] I'm certainly not talking about
[45:57] some kind of an iron statue and some
[46:00] kind of a doings it's going to be a
[46:02] Doctrine right
[46:05] that old doctrine of Rome
[46:10] the old Roman paganism
[46:14] and once the Catholic Church started off
[46:16] what has they got now
[46:20] paganism the same old Roman thing is
[46:23] coming back to totally today
[46:26] they shall mingle themselves with the
[46:28] seed of men but they shall not bleed one
[46:31] to the other even an iron is not mixed
[46:34] with Clay amen
[46:37] yeah you don't keep it separated just
[46:39] enough
[46:41] but yet it's going to all be the same
[46:43] Doctrine
[46:46] and when we get to the image to the
[46:48] Beast you're going to see what that
[46:49] those things are
[46:50] the same Doctrine
[46:53] you say I'm blessed God I don't have no
[46:55] doctor of my sister one day she was
[46:56] talking about something the Catholic
[46:58] church I said would you mind explaining
[46:59] the difference between the Catholic
[47:01] Doctrine and the Baptist Doctrine
[47:03] she thought a minute and she said they
[47:06] worship Mary and we worship Jesus
[47:08] they don't worship Mary
[47:11] they just gotta heard of God
[47:15] but see that was her idea
[47:17] watch now
[47:19] and in the days of these Kings
[47:23] I ain't worried about them
[47:26] Nebuchadnezzar the means of Persians
[47:29] Alexander All In I ain't worried about
[47:33] natural Rome are you
[47:35] we've done been told even don't worry
[47:37] about communism right right right
[47:40] but worry about Catholicism right all
[47:45] right
[47:45] in the days of these Kings shall the god
[47:48] of Heaven set up a kingdom amen
[47:51] now that's what I'm looking for that's
[47:53] that's the thing I'm looking at
[47:56] I just look at the other to see where it
[47:58] leads down to where I'm at right and I
[48:00] see them over there and then I know
[48:01] what's over here
[48:05] you can see them as they come down to
[48:07] the Natural room
[48:09] Nebuchadnezzar and all that was Rome
[48:12] then it dropped down to the next and
[48:14] that it was still wrong
[48:18] and then you come down to the Catholic
[48:20] church and it's still wrong
[48:25] then you come down to the provisions and
[48:27] they're still wrong
[48:30] which you'll never be destroyed okay
[48:34] I thought you want to set up a kingdom
[48:35] in this day
[48:37] if we believe all of that's coming down
[48:39] to this day in the natural out there
[48:42] then why can't we believe what God says
[48:44] gonna take place all right
[48:46] remember he showed Nebuchadnezzar
[48:50] down to where we're at remember that was
[48:53] part of Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[48:57] to see a stone cut out of the Mountain
[48:59] Stone that wasn't Daniel's dream right
[49:03] that's right that would never can ever
[49:04] scream
[49:06] showed him right down to where we're at
[49:09] well for certain if those Natural Things
[49:11] took place why can't we believe the
[49:14] spiritual is going to take that all
[49:15] right why can't we be under expectation
[49:18] to see these things amen
[49:24] or are we so dried up in lady you'll see
[49:26] if we become common with it and just
[49:27] want to stay here
[49:28] all right
[49:30] that's right
[49:33] God has taken care of that old stuff
[49:36] about getting us out of here you know he
[49:37] just lets us get old
[49:40] I knew that was going to strike but it
[49:42] ain't gonna hit before we need it
[49:44] but you know we're going to get out of
[49:45] here one way then right I like what one
[49:49] brother said they said something about
[49:50] said he's 80 years old he said
[49:52] I'm not worried about it
[49:54] is it either I'm going to be in the
[49:57] ground and be raised or I'm going to be
[49:59] changed he said I'm closed
[50:07] and then the days of these Kings
[50:11] now remember what we covered Sunday
[50:15] that it's not Kings
[50:18] see
[50:20] Nebuchadnezzar and coming down Alexander
[50:22] and all that was Kings Rome had King
[50:25] Caesar and all this other you know
[50:27] Augustus and all of the whatever his
[50:29] name was I never could figure out all
[50:31] them things you say Herod but he's only
[50:32] over a little piece right here there was
[50:34] a big Caesar over the underground at all
[50:39] but according to what we found out there
[50:41] the other day it's not going to be king
[50:42] it's going to be dictators all right and
[50:45] bro the prophet said look where those
[50:47] dictators lean he said they leaned to
[50:49] Communism amen Michael we bought them
[50:53] we pay them but what's going to happen
[50:54] we can't pay them no more even in this
[50:58] paying them they're turning to Communism
[50:59] or some Islams or whatever
[51:02] you know
[51:05] you know I I don't understand it I'm a
[51:07] human being I'm not I don't count myself
[51:10] to be mean or arrogant but I'm just
[51:12] straight
[51:16] you know you get over there and you see
[51:17] those people going in and blowing up
[51:19] people and their own people
[51:24] now I put an end if we went but one way
[51:28] if I was the government I put an end to
[51:30] them people blowing them up if it
[51:31] wouldn't but for one way
[51:33] I'd get every one of those priests that
[51:36] teach
[51:37] that they're going to get 70 virgins
[51:41] he would get in the Pulpit if I had to
[51:43] hold a gun to his head with a and
[51:46] say you say one word it ain't right
[51:49] not so you tell them people they ain't
[51:51] getting 70 virgins
[51:53] they're going to hell for what they're
[51:55] doing
[51:56] you see that ain't a nice way for a
[51:58] Christian I ain't talking about a
[51:59] Christian that ain't talking about
[52:00] Christianity they're talking about
[52:01] natural things all right why can't those
[52:04] governments get shaken over there and
[52:06] say all right you kill any more we
[52:09] coming out of you they know who they are
[52:10] right right true
[52:15] sorry about that
[52:16] I know you don't like those foreign
[52:18] people out there bro don't like it but
[52:20] I'm just I'm flying I'm honest that's a
[52:23] way to put stop to them things you tell
[52:26] that high priest you quit teaching him
[52:28] he's going to heaven because of what he
[52:29] does
[52:30] you tell him he's going to hell
[52:37] right
[52:39] you know the days of these Kings shall
[52:42] the god of Heaven Sent up a kingdom
[52:43] which shall never be destroyed and the
[52:46] kingdom shall not be left to other
[52:48] people
[52:50] that's right but it's your break into
[52:51] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[52:55] and it shall stand forever amen amen
[52:58] much
[52:59] for as much as thou saw us that the
[53:02] stone was cut out of the mountain with
[53:04] our hands and then it break in pieces
[53:06] the iron the rice the clay the silver
[53:09] and the gold
[53:11] the great God hath made known to the
[53:14] king what shall come to pass Hereafter
[53:18] and a dream is certain and the
[53:21] interpretation there are sure
[53:26] there's going to be a bride
[53:29] that will stand on the word
[53:32] right amen
[53:35] it's our two weeks to find out whether
[53:37] we're in it or not to find out that part
[53:41] all right
[53:43] yeah but now remember what I'll say it
[53:45] over and over
[53:48] if you notice through what we went down
[53:51] one two three four each one of those
[53:53] nations with just another Nation
[53:54] following it another Nation foreign
[53:59] and it stopped it wrong
[54:03] but the dream didn't stop it wrong
[54:08] well because it was going to be more to
[54:10] be told of the story right
[54:13] are you listening to get a point I know
[54:15] I'm calling one a lot I try to help it
[54:17] but I mean I'm guessing me
[54:23] but you see he showed him coming down to
[54:26] the four kingdoms that was going to end
[54:28] in natural Rome right
[54:31] right
[54:33] then he gave him the part of the dream
[54:37] that would show that it would have to
[54:39] convert from a natural government
[54:43] to continue on down
[54:46] because Rome was the last government
[54:49] that was shown right
[54:53] right so it's gonna have to change
[54:56] so he showed him that
[54:58] it showed him coming down to the end
[55:01] when Pagan Rome will have to become
[55:04] powerful wrong
[55:10] right yep
[55:11] she made more to the dream than never
[55:14] can ever saw
[55:15] Nebuchadnezzar was only concerned with
[55:17] his feet with him and where he was at
[55:20] but God showed him all the way down and
[55:22] showed him the last natural government
[55:23] would be wrong right amen
[55:28] but then he showed him the mingling of
[55:30] the toes and the clay and the iron and
[55:32] the different thing as something else
[55:34] coming into being right right
[55:38] and it would go from a natural
[55:40] governmental form
[55:42] to more of a spiritual form
[55:46] all right
[55:48] now Nebuchadnezzar had his dream
[55:53] let's go to the next one
[55:56] because Daniel had a dream
[56:00] in the first year about
[56:03] Shazer king of Babylon Daniel had a
[56:05] dream not about the Shader because
[56:07] that's that's who Daniel now Belle
[56:09] shades are I guess is what do you
[56:10] pronounced king of battling Daniel had a
[56:13] dream
[56:14] and visions of his head upon his bed
[56:16] then he wrote the dream and told the sum
[56:20] of the matters
[56:22] I hear Daniel
[56:25] and let's see if if Daniel's dream
[56:29] Vision was the same as Nebuchadnezzar
[56:34] but yet adding more to the story
[56:38] you have spoken said I saw in my vision
[56:40] by night no wondering and behold the
[56:44] Four Winds
[56:46] of the heavens drove upon the Great Sea
[56:50] I want you
[56:52] and four great Beast came up from this
[56:55] from the diverse one
[56:57] from another
[57:02] what was it first over there verse 4
[57:04] says the first was like a line
[57:07] and that Eagle's Wings
[57:10] I be held till the wings are ever put
[57:13] and it was lifted up from the Earth
[57:17] and made stand up on the feet as a man
[57:19] and a man's heart was given to it
[57:24] now
[57:27] you were only dealing while ago with a
[57:29] natural government
[57:31] showing Nebuchadnezzar
[57:34] Daniel's automatically starting off to a
[57:37] man
[57:39] right yep
[57:41] in a man's heart given
[57:45] what do you do when you give an amount
[57:46] of heart
[57:49] when you get a man who desires of his
[57:51] Hearts you give him the desires that he
[57:52] has right or what he's thinking about
[57:58] and he said never that never can answer
[57:59] you're a great man
[58:02] back up forward right
[58:05] and you're a great nation
[58:10] and said what you're doing is natural
[58:11] things
[58:13] now Daniel is going to jump over and see
[58:16] a little more to the story
[58:18] because he's going to deal with a man's
[58:20] heart
[58:22] first was like a line that was never
[58:25] knead
[58:27] right
[58:29] what's the next one
[58:32] and behold another Beast
[58:35] a second life to a like to a bear and it
[58:38] raised up itself on one side and it had
[58:41] three ribs in the mouth of it between
[58:43] the teeth of it
[58:44] and they said thus unto it arrives
[58:47] Divine much flesh
[58:53] if Daniel is picking up something that's
[58:58] going to help us to understand how Pagan
[59:00] Rome becomes powerful wrong
[59:03] because now Daniel is dealing with a
[59:04] man's heart
[59:08] and his ideas and talks
[59:11] instead of it being just Nebuchadnezzar
[59:14] is coming down to where we are
[59:17] right
[59:19] number two is to be to be Persia
[59:22] instead of it just being a natural
[59:23] government what is it
[59:26] me
[59:28] rise into our flesh
[59:32] More's added to Daniel's dream than it
[59:35] was Nebuchadnezzar watch number verse
[59:37] six I had
[59:41] like a leopard you remember old
[59:42] Revelation it Revelations
[59:45] um verse 2 13 verse 2 it speaks of a
[59:48] leopard
[59:50] but it's Greece under Alexander which
[59:52] was a natural girl but what after this
[59:54] I'll be held in below another
[59:57] like a leopard Which hat which had up on
[1:00:01] the back of it for wings of a fowl the
[1:00:04] Beast had also four heads
[1:00:07] and Dominion was given to it he's coming
[1:00:10] on down
[1:00:11] watch it unfold little this will go
[1:00:13] along right
[1:00:21] wrong exceedingly it had great iron
[1:00:23] teeth it divide and break in pieces and
[1:00:27] stamped the residue with the feet of it
[1:00:29] and it was diverse from all the beasts
[1:00:32] that were before it
[1:00:35] and it had 10 horns right
[1:00:40] where does it come to in the Book of
[1:00:42] Daniel I mean the Book of Revelation
[1:00:46] seven heads ten horns
[1:00:48] all right
[1:00:50] so what do they see look at number three
[1:00:54] what's the quarter number three
[1:00:57] excuse me
[1:00:58] I got it up
[1:01:00] I didn't want to read all of this but we
[1:01:02] can go ahead go ahead just leave it up
[1:01:03] we read the whole thing
[1:01:05] this is
[1:01:07] I got 123 124 I think it goes to 125 of
[1:01:10] the marketplace I read some of this the
[1:01:11] other day
[1:01:13] foreign
[1:01:16] chapter now to begin with and if you
[1:01:18] notice on down in the chapter here said
[1:01:21] I looked and lo a lamb stood upon Mount
[1:01:24] Shania Lord I beg your pardon me I'm in
[1:01:26] the wrong verse wrong chapter 14 30. all
[1:01:29] right and I stood upon the Sands of the
[1:01:31] sea and saw a beast coming out of the
[1:01:33] sea
[1:01:34] having seven horns heads and ten horns
[1:01:38] and up on the orange tin crowns and upon
[1:01:42] his head it's the name of black seeds
[1:01:44] what is blasphemy you remember had this
[1:01:46] the other day
[1:01:48] it used to make fun of ridicule talk
[1:01:50] about and watch he had seven heads ten
[1:01:52] horns and when he come up out of the sea
[1:01:54] now
[1:01:55] Revelation 17 you knew that's putting it
[1:01:58] down 1715 said that that the waters
[1:02:01] represent
[1:02:02] thickness and multitudes of people so
[1:02:05] it's me's represented power
[1:02:07] ungodly power
[1:02:10] be still pray raised up out of the
[1:02:13] people in other words where it's coming
[1:02:14] and he stood upon the sand of the sea
[1:02:16] and I saw the Beast and the Beast which
[1:02:18] I saw was like a leopard now he's in
[1:02:20] Chapter 13 right and his feet where's
[1:02:23] the feet of a Byron his mouth on the
[1:02:24] line
[1:02:25] and the dragon gave him his power and
[1:02:27] seen in great authority to drive him and
[1:02:30] we got two things under consideration
[1:02:31] now watch this Beast it had four
[1:02:34] different characters in it
[1:02:36] if you'll take Daniel 7 you are marking
[1:02:39] it down Daniel 7 Daniel Shaw which is
[1:02:43] where we just went with the down your
[1:02:46] stream right Daniel saw the same vision
[1:02:49] 800 years before this
[1:02:53] child division he saw those bees
[1:02:56] separating one from the other in the
[1:02:58] beginning of the Gentile ruling
[1:03:00] taught now Daniel 2.
[1:03:03] and Daniel 7 is just more of Daniel sure
[1:03:06] anymore watch Revelation 13. showing you
[1:03:09] more
[1:03:11] right you understand me right
[1:03:13] right more is being unfolded
[1:03:16] it's coming down now to whether it's
[1:03:18] getting into our day
[1:03:22] to over we can see it
[1:03:31] Revelation 13 3. and I saw one of his
[1:03:35] heads as it were wounded to death
[1:03:38] and his deadly wound was healed and the
[1:03:41] world wondered after the Beast
[1:03:47] he had a deadly wound
[1:03:51] in the head
[1:03:52] one of the others brought around gives
[1:03:54] it one of the other writers like Mafia
[1:03:56] one third of them said he he was throat
[1:03:58] was cut he was bleeding mortally
[1:04:01] you know
[1:04:02] what you see what I'm talking about
[1:04:04] now
[1:04:07] you something about
[1:04:09] it was wounded to the death right but it
[1:04:12] don't die
[1:04:14] all right
[1:04:16] because it was healed
[1:04:19] now what happened there
[1:04:23] it was mortally wounded number five
[1:04:29] which is a permanent your cage I paid
[1:04:32] 194 of the church's book
[1:04:36] that's wrong
[1:04:38] Haven Imperial Rome was no longer iron
[1:04:45] Pagan Imperial Rome
[1:04:49] ended of who was the king
[1:04:53] there was that finally ended the Roman
[1:04:56] the government but he held after Calvary
[1:04:58] coming on that
[1:05:00] wrong could not now rule
[1:05:02] he's talking about the wrong Nation
[1:05:05] it was all over
[1:05:07] so thought the world right
[1:05:11] but how wrong the world was
[1:05:14] for that head wrong the wounded the
[1:05:18] wounded was not wounded unto death
[1:05:23] that's right see the world thought wrong
[1:05:27] ended but it did go on to the next
[1:05:34] from the parent the church age book
[1:05:38] her
[1:05:40] anything that's the word now we know
[1:05:42] that the wounded hand was the Pagan Rome
[1:05:45] in the Roman Empire that great political
[1:05:49] world power
[1:05:50] this head rose again as done
[1:05:54] Roman Catholic spiritual Empire
[1:05:58] the Pagan Rome becomes powerful Rome
[1:06:03] now what's the difference between the
[1:06:05] two
[1:06:09] Pagan Rome
[1:06:11] becomes powerful now it's reading these
[1:06:13] things I didn't bring if you want them I
[1:06:14] can get a
[1:06:16] brother random was emphasizing it like
[1:06:18] this he was talking about how that that
[1:06:21] the only difference was that they they
[1:06:24] stopped being a natural government right
[1:06:27] you know to rule
[1:06:29] and now it's ruling the World by a
[1:06:32] spiritual
[1:06:35] Beast
[1:06:39] the Roman Catholic Church
[1:06:46] Pagan Rome
[1:06:48] went down
[1:06:52] it turned into spiritual realm there's
[1:06:55] your
[1:06:56] Pagan Rome being destroyed your paparom
[1:06:59] coming forth there's your wound that was
[1:07:01] unto death
[1:07:04] but it didn't kill it
[1:07:07] it just moved it from a natural to a
[1:07:09] spiritual wasn't it
[1:07:12] now watch this carefully
[1:07:15] what did political Pagan Rome do
[1:07:18] that was the basis of her success
[1:07:21] natural wrong now what did natural wrong
[1:07:24] do it was the basis of her success
[1:07:27] she divided and conquered
[1:07:31] go back and show you history that was
[1:07:34] the Sea of Rome
[1:07:37] divide and conquer
[1:07:40] her iron teeth core and divide whom she
[1:07:44] tore and divide could not rise again as
[1:07:46] when she did destroyed Carthage there
[1:07:49] ain't pronounce it word
[1:07:51] and showed her to assault
[1:07:54] the same iron seed remained it remained
[1:07:57] in her when she arose as the false
[1:08:00] Church
[1:08:01] and her policy was has remained the same
[1:08:05] dividing company that is the
[1:08:08] nicolaitanism and God hates it amen
[1:08:13] Pagan Rome
[1:08:15] identical same thing as
[1:08:18] paper roll
[1:08:21] Pagan Rome had a one-man ruler right
[1:08:25] Caesar whatever his name was whatever
[1:08:27] which one you put her
[1:08:30] starting out never
[1:08:39] one head
[1:08:41] over all in the world
[1:08:45] what's the Catholic Church guy
[1:08:49] that's right that's right amen
[1:08:52] I'll try it and we'll get to it a little
[1:08:55] bit later on as we get along into the
[1:08:57] 13th chapter
[1:08:59] we ought to well remember
[1:09:03] how that over in
[1:09:05] what was it oh man goodness we're
[1:09:08] talking about the other night
[1:09:10] uh what was the country the pope come
[1:09:12] from
[1:09:14] yeah
[1:09:16] but there's some Germany what was the
[1:09:18] one before Poland okay Poland
[1:09:24] you remember what happened there
[1:09:28] the Catholic Church which you know who
[1:09:31] told him to go do it
[1:09:36] they went out protested
[1:09:39] and the military would not fire on them
[1:09:43] you remember that you ought to remember
[1:09:45] that by just an actual dude and then you
[1:09:46] laugh you'll remember reading about it
[1:09:50] that was where that it took over and
[1:09:53] brought forth their freedom
[1:09:57] well Russia
[1:10:00] because the military refused to fire
[1:10:02] almost one
[1:10:09] sure that was their people
[1:10:12] sure
[1:10:14] but who was given the orders for them to
[1:10:16] even March out there
[1:10:18] I thought that Pope come from Poland
[1:10:22] didn't one of them do
[1:10:26] you see who can make war against this
[1:10:28] man
[1:10:31] I'm just giving you natural things that
[1:10:33] happened in our day
[1:10:35] right we'll get into the image of the
[1:10:36] Beast to show you know that we've got
[1:10:37] the military power David as I said the
[1:10:39] other day
[1:10:41] religious control and power right
[1:10:47] same thing
[1:10:50] we saw to him wounded unto death
[1:10:55] all right pull up the next one where are
[1:10:57] we at
[1:10:58] let's see what time we got
[1:11:00] number seven why we are not our
[1:11:02] denomination 58 9 27. get an idea of the
[1:11:05] the date the brother brought my
[1:11:06] attention the other day I don't see
[1:11:09] under this
[1:11:10] uh system we use because we have to use
[1:11:13] it to be able to hook up the internet
[1:11:14] system it's the number 10 on the uh the
[1:11:17] new system see it doesn't give the the
[1:11:19] place where it's priest now
[1:11:24] uh the um 95 version will give you the
[1:11:27] place where it's preached at and a lot
[1:11:29] of this in this one will give you the
[1:11:30] place where it's freestyle but not all
[1:11:32] totally all right so I try to give the
[1:11:34] date
[1:11:36] so you can go to the date of it because
[1:11:39] like say the token it streaks four
[1:11:41] different times 63 and it's over in the
[1:11:43] 64 the last time in the springs well if
[1:11:45] you don't win lunch better build one of
[1:11:47] them Jeffersonville please people don't
[1:11:49] know which one if you go to the dates of
[1:11:51] it 69.
[1:12:02] now watch listen to this just a minute
[1:12:04] five Kings which was Fallen five Kings
[1:12:06] if you want to know from the history
[1:12:08] I'll show it
[1:12:10] to you and one is
[1:12:13] and wants to come
[1:12:15] yep
[1:12:16] now watch him
[1:12:18] now watch the Beast
[1:12:20] now the Beast wasn't a king
[1:12:26] he was one which is
[1:12:29] which is not
[1:12:32] and yet he is
[1:12:34] and if not you remember that in the
[1:12:35] scripture yeah
[1:12:36] yet he is and he has not what is it six
[1:12:40] section of popes
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:43] so he's giving you a power of these
[1:12:46] ruling that's when Pagan Rome was
[1:12:49] converted to make purple Rome
[1:12:52] Pagan Rome was converted and then it
[1:12:54] become the papacy which they had a pope
[1:12:57] and instead of a king and the pope is
[1:13:00] the spiritual King
[1:13:01] right that's the reason he's a crowned
[1:13:05] spiritual King claims to be the backer
[1:13:08] of Jesus Christ
[1:13:13] the Catholic church had the king
[1:13:15] yeah the world today has a king
[1:13:20] I don't even know what his name is
[1:13:23] that's how much I keep up with things
[1:13:26] I keep up with what wrote around said
[1:13:27] about me but he's not here to tell me
[1:13:29] what this guy's name is so I can't even
[1:13:31] remember it a lot of times
[1:13:33] I hope this and Pope down or whatever
[1:13:35] it's a succession of popes he's the king
[1:13:41] and one of them lived three months
[1:13:42] wouldn't it
[1:13:45] in one month with a one month one of the
[1:13:48] pokes that was crowned yeah 30 days 30
[1:13:51] days yeah with no more
[1:13:54] they must not like you
[1:13:57] that's right I just got a natural today
[1:13:59] okay no problem I don't care anyway
[1:14:03] I don't mean that wrong brother die and
[1:14:05] I don't care what happened
[1:14:06] because it has nothing to do with me as
[1:14:09] long as I'm on this side of it
[1:14:12] of the understanding
[1:14:14] right but look at the next one piece of
[1:14:16] the trumpets
[1:14:18] 1964 719 the morning service program
[1:14:21] 163.
[1:14:23] there is that Roman Empire
[1:14:26] Bound by their what
[1:14:28] the ecclesiastical power
[1:14:31] which Rome Pagan Rome became powerful
[1:14:34] Rome
[1:14:35] and was bound there in his traditions of
[1:14:39] Christians
[1:14:42] now watch now
[1:14:44] you see why it becomes iron and Clay the
[1:14:47] mingling and the different things
[1:14:50] the iron was the leftover from the king
[1:14:53] the clay is coming over into religious
[1:14:57] matters come on that's right it was
[1:15:00] bound there and traditions of Christians
[1:15:02] what part of Christian and the
[1:15:05] superstitions it had of Rome putting
[1:15:07] together all these
[1:15:09] worship of women
[1:15:11] what did Rome do to natural and all
[1:15:14] these other kind of stuff and Christmas
[1:15:16] days and holidays and holy days and
[1:15:19] things
[1:15:19] it's been bound with that tradition that
[1:15:22] it cannot let loose
[1:15:24] because it's against Christian
[1:15:26] principles
[1:15:28] still the same ungodly Pagan spirit and
[1:15:31] that Spirit caught into the nations of
[1:15:33] the world
[1:15:35] according to the Prophecies of Ezekiel
[1:15:37] and the rest of them
[1:15:41] look around the world today
[1:15:46] who done away with Communism
[1:15:50] it was on the the
[1:15:52] which one of them live magazine or which
[1:15:54] one
[1:15:56] Times magazine the front of it I had
[1:15:59] Reagan and the Pope that they got
[1:16:01] together and done away with Communism
[1:16:03] right
[1:16:04] yep now that's what they printed
[1:16:09] the poll vocated for us to push the arms
[1:16:11] race
[1:16:13] and they claimed we had all kind of
[1:16:16] Supernatural almost weapons
[1:16:20] well Russia was just spending millions
[1:16:22] of dollars to try to catch up with us
[1:16:23] and we didn't even have it right
[1:16:25] right it was just fake stuff
[1:16:29] but they done it to bus wrong
[1:16:32] now what if they'd have demanded the
[1:16:33] payment today they that wrong almost
[1:16:36] Russia what if Russia what if the day
[1:16:39] Russia was
[1:16:41] demanded to pay what if they demanded
[1:16:43] our payment
[1:16:46] and how much bigger is our national debt
[1:16:49] today than it was in the 60s foreign
[1:16:57] I remember back when we was in school of
[1:17:01] what they call national debt and they
[1:17:03] figured out every person
[1:17:06] owed about ten thousand dollars
[1:17:10] but boy that would be sure different
[1:17:11] today wouldn't it that's right
[1:17:14] what is the national debt today how many
[1:17:16] trillion yes
[1:17:17] 16 trillion or something
[1:17:23] what you see is the breaking our nation
[1:17:25] yep
[1:17:27] you don't ever read or remember
[1:17:29] you know that when they started Social
[1:17:32] Security
[1:17:34] there was enough money put in the fund
[1:17:36] that never one dollar would ever have to
[1:17:39] be added to the Social Security fund
[1:17:44] right that's how much money they put
[1:17:46] aside
[1:17:48] now there's three people working and
[1:17:50] four people drawing or something like
[1:17:52] that I don't know the exact number but
[1:17:54] that's right but see you would have
[1:17:55] never had to pay to any Social Security
[1:17:57] because it was to be set up for retirees
[1:18:04] right now it's anybody ease right right
[1:18:09] anybody go out and have a couple of
[1:18:11] babies they go down and apply
[1:18:14] and I didn't mean that language like
[1:18:16] that to imply any race
[1:18:19] I mean it to imply the race of Americans
[1:18:22] the degrading situation we're all in
[1:18:25] we voted our own rights away
[1:18:34] for Denton
[1:18:38] but now listen
[1:18:45] you remember
[1:18:50] let's see him get number nine world
[1:18:53] number eight go ahead and read number
[1:18:54] nine then we'll drop back this review
[1:18:56] just a second quick
[1:19:00] all right page 192
[1:19:03] . Not only was State and church wedded
[1:19:06] in this age
[1:19:08] but the Babylonian religion
[1:19:11] was officially joined
[1:19:13] to the first church
[1:19:18] the Babylonian
[1:19:20] religion
[1:19:21] that's why it's called missionary
[1:19:23] Babylon when we're in about 17th chapter
[1:19:25] somewhere in there mystery Babylon
[1:19:30] you know the Catholic Church admits
[1:19:32] they're that woman
[1:19:37] I say Amen
[1:19:40] well look
[1:19:42] Not only was church and state waited at
[1:19:45] this age what part of me and what is it
[1:19:47] one two three the Third Church age by
[1:19:51] the third church I think it meant
[1:19:52] thoroughly married and one of them did
[1:19:55] but the Babylonian religion was
[1:19:58] officially joined to the church
[1:20:02] now think about it
[1:20:04] Roman religion
[1:20:07] Satan now had access
[1:20:10] Now read what that prophet's saying
[1:20:13] Satan now had access to the name of
[1:20:16] Christ
[1:20:21] and he was enthroned as God In Worship
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:26] yep
[1:20:28] it's really hit me the other day when I
[1:20:30] read it verse
[1:20:33] maybe he had access to the name of
[1:20:35] Christ
[1:20:40] he claims he's the biker one who speaks
[1:20:43] for Christ or instead of Christ
[1:20:45] so we've got the name of Christ
[1:20:48] right
[1:20:51] with the help of Federal Aid
[1:20:56] the churches fell out to beautiful
[1:20:58] buildings
[1:21:02] which were lined with orders of white
[1:21:04] marble and images of The Departed Saints
[1:21:09] now did they take it and sweep it out
[1:21:10] and do new now
[1:21:12] and right at this age is where the Beast
[1:21:14] of Revelation 13 3 that was wounded to
[1:21:18] death the Pagan Rome Empire came back to
[1:21:21] life and Powers as a Holy Roman Empire
[1:21:25] Rome as a material Nation had suffered
[1:21:28] much depletion and soon would suffer it
[1:21:31] completely
[1:21:32] but it mattered not now
[1:21:35] for her religious Empire would keep her
[1:21:39] own top of the world government from the
[1:21:42] inside where she would not where she
[1:21:45] would not appear to be so from the
[1:21:48] outside
[1:21:53] become very religious right
[1:21:58] become
[1:22:02] until John
[1:22:04] on Patmos that's right I admired it
[1:22:07] that's right
[1:22:08] you remember that
[1:22:12] John admired this
[1:22:15] woman amen
[1:22:17] the world has fallen at her feet yep
[1:22:23] same old Roman government
[1:22:27] that used to rule by the fist of iron
[1:22:30] and Conquer Nations until it took over
[1:22:32] the world
[1:22:34] let's see what was it releasing
[1:22:35] yesterday what brought around and said
[1:22:36] that
[1:22:38] which wanted one that died he taught his
[1:22:41] mother because there's a single tree and
[1:22:43] running through the city and and burned
[1:22:45] Rome and blinded them Nero
[1:22:51] Waterloo was where who was it
[1:22:54] Napoleon found his end those governments
[1:22:58] finally come to an end
[1:23:00] but the same old Doctrine they had
[1:23:03] appeared in the Christianity
[1:23:06] when who was it
[1:23:10] gave the Christians
[1:23:13] Constantine gave the Christians and is
[1:23:15] never a record he would ever convert or
[1:23:17] anything
[1:23:18] he gave the churches
[1:23:21] to the people big old buildings they had
[1:23:24] but they didn't take down this and do
[1:23:26] put up a
[1:23:27] even an image of Christ right
[1:23:30] they probably move things around for a
[1:23:32] little while until they got used to it
[1:23:35] but then after a while they begin to
[1:23:37] worship ancestors and things
[1:23:39] right until you get into the doctrines
[1:23:42] and ideas of mankind and you know
[1:23:45] there's a denomination now that baptizes
[1:23:47] unto the Dead
[1:23:53] you know if you're a member of their
[1:23:54] group and you died
[1:23:56] Alone brother or somebody can come along
[1:23:59] and be baptized in your place and that's
[1:24:01] post a movie I reckon out of purgatory
[1:24:05] yeah
[1:24:06] see Pagan Rome become powerful wrong
[1:24:10] now rules the world
[1:24:14] how much longer we're going to have
[1:24:16] religious freedom to be able to even
[1:24:17] speak that I don't know right it can
[1:24:20] close out at any time why because it's
[1:24:21] getting drastically bad
[1:24:24] yeah I'm not looking for it and hoping
[1:24:26] it'll come I'm just saying we're here
[1:24:29] and I'm glad of it right man maybe
[1:24:31] that's a carnal way of making it express
[1:24:33] me right you know what
[1:24:35] I think it's about time for all of it to
[1:24:37] come to an end amen coaches I said
[1:24:41] Daniel Saul Nebuchadnezzar saw not just
[1:24:45] the end of Rome
[1:24:48] as a national government
[1:24:52] one just added a little more to it if
[1:24:55] you followed what I said John in the
[1:24:57] Book of Revelations adds a little more
[1:24:59] to the story brings it down more that
[1:25:02] you can understand right
[1:25:05] and iron Daniel
[1:25:09] he tells that King
[1:25:12] he said one of these days there's going
[1:25:13] to be
[1:25:15] a group of people that's going to raise
[1:25:17] up
[1:25:19] and they're going to be the one that was
[1:25:21] destroyed
[1:25:23] an image to the Beast well we're not
[1:25:27] going out if I literally I hope you
[1:25:29] understand right man what does it mean
[1:25:33] just a second what does it mean to
[1:25:35] destroy the image or hit the image in
[1:25:38] the feet in a different thing what is it
[1:25:40] mean in Simplicity to you
[1:25:43] Stone cut out of the mountain without
[1:25:45] Stone what does that mean I thought we
[1:25:48] believe the stone was a revealed word
[1:25:52] well now
[1:25:54] if you think that we're supposed to go
[1:25:57] out
[1:25:58] and every person you talk to who was
[1:26:00] supposed to slap their feet
[1:26:03] with a Doctrine you sure have missed the
[1:26:07] whole concept
[1:26:08] of anything
[1:26:13] what do you try to destroy in the other
[1:26:15] person's Doctrine
[1:26:23] I remember a certain brother here one
[1:26:25] time I didn't talk to him about it and
[1:26:27] try to get him to get out of any kind of
[1:26:29] a group
[1:26:32] I just told in the Bible
[1:26:36] and I've done it over years I didn't do
[1:26:38] this one time
[1:26:40] he come to me one day and he said
[1:26:41] brother they lied to me
[1:26:49] he said they lied to me
[1:26:52] he said to settlement from Adam
[1:26:56] Is Not Duplicate that's right that's
[1:26:59] right
[1:27:01] but see he's so understand
[1:27:03] amen I didn't have to tell me right
[1:27:05] Brothers don't I didn't tell them to get
[1:27:08] her out of those things
[1:27:12] the truth told him to what to do right
[1:27:16] looks like I told a man one day I said
[1:27:18] if you've got something that could make
[1:27:19] me a Christian matter and you won't tell
[1:27:21] me there's something wrong with you
[1:27:23] that's right I said cause I'm doing my
[1:27:25] best to try to tell you how to be a
[1:27:28] Christian and live better and be a
[1:27:31] better person
[1:27:33] if you think you've got some kind of
[1:27:35] secret code you keep from me that I
[1:27:37] couldn't be a better person
[1:27:40] then you're wrong
[1:27:44] but you see where we're at church
[1:27:47] we're in the finish of all things
[1:27:51] I believe this message when it came
[1:27:53] there in 63 I believe that was the
[1:27:56] descendant of God Amen that's right now
[1:27:58] not the man I didn't say that I said the
[1:28:00] message
[1:28:02] was the descendant of God
[1:28:06] oh that's what your Prophet said it
[1:28:07] would be amen for the message
[1:28:10] and that would be the coming of the
[1:28:12] stone of Daniel
[1:28:14] that will hit the image in the feet
[1:28:19] and destroy that image
[1:28:22] and that's you and me with this message
[1:28:25] not just brother Brown because it didn't
[1:28:27] destroy everything when brother Brown
[1:28:29] came that's right
[1:28:30] it's for you and I not to go out and
[1:28:33] argue with the world and fuss with them
[1:28:38] see that's where the problem is you get
[1:28:40] people to come into message you're just
[1:28:41] about like it was in the days of Martin
[1:28:43] Luther you know when they begin to see
[1:28:45] Martin Luther were talking about to
[1:28:46] adjust shall live by faith they thought
[1:28:48] he meant for them to do it and they went
[1:28:51] out and burned the churches
[1:28:55] because they thought that's what Luther
[1:28:57] was saying
[1:28:59] no one that run around and said it was
[1:29:01] hard for him to keep his head above all
[1:29:02] the fanaticism that went around his
[1:29:04] message
[1:29:06] you just ain't going by and seeing a
[1:29:08] beautiful building on finding people
[1:29:09] saying Luther we've done what you told
[1:29:12] us did we set that building on fire he
[1:29:14] said that ain't the one I'm talking
[1:29:15] about and what I'm talking about is
[1:29:16] standing looking at
[1:29:21] demon power that has been building you
[1:29:26] it's not an image of rolling down
[1:29:28] through and bumping all of these things
[1:29:29] out of the way like a rolling bowling
[1:29:31] ball going down to a an alley
[1:29:37] it's our ideas right that's right
[1:29:41] our thoughts
[1:29:43] that are contrary to the truth
[1:29:47] you know like I said it started a while
[1:29:49] ago
[1:29:50] you can't get rid of them
[1:29:53] until they're revealed to being all
[1:29:55] right that's right yep
[1:29:58] because you're not gonna try to get rid
[1:29:59] of them
[1:30:01] that's right you're happy what you are
[1:30:03] I'm going to church we got a good group
[1:30:05] we're happy we're in the message
[1:30:08] yeah
[1:30:09] what is the message
[1:30:13] is going to roll down through Babylon
[1:30:15] amen all right yep
[1:30:18] but you know who used to sing it and I'm
[1:30:20] not throwing off on them
[1:30:22] Pentecost that was a Pentecostal song
[1:30:25] rolling down to Babylon
[1:30:30] and it wound up right in the same
[1:30:31] Doctrine
[1:30:34] Amen to the Catholic Church
[1:30:38] and they would fight you over that
[1:30:41] to tell you that was not right
[1:30:44] but what is their Doctrine
[1:30:51] isn't it odd you come into this message
[1:30:53] and the arguments is over the godhead
[1:30:59] but not on
[1:31:01] we've only got one message telling us
[1:31:03] about the godhead
[1:31:05] and people are arguing over the godhead
[1:31:09] of what to Target and I see it wrong
[1:31:10] that's it amen
[1:31:14] and remember nashia Rome was called by
[1:31:18] Constantine
[1:31:25] the person I see in Council was
[1:31:27] set in motion by Constantine
[1:31:34] they're trying to get to church together
[1:31:35] that's right
[1:31:37] where they would agree with one another
[1:31:42] what is it today oh those are good
[1:31:44] people Brother David you shouldn't be
[1:31:46] thrown off on those Brothers in the
[1:31:47] message that's their way of seeing it
[1:31:49] and you see it different
[1:31:52] uh compound Revelation compound meaning
[1:31:55] don't mean you can see something you can
[1:31:58] three seek three gods and I can see one
[1:32:00] right that's not compound Revelation
[1:32:02] remember what I preached the other day
[1:32:04] that's right
[1:32:05] that's right that's right
[1:32:08] compound Revelation is what I've been
[1:32:10] talking about tonight how did that all
[1:32:12] Roman government
[1:32:15] got quote drowned and destroyed yeah
[1:32:19] but then its ideas
[1:32:23] okay
[1:32:24] just come over
[1:32:27] you remember Israel come on
[1:32:30] you remember Israel we want a king
[1:32:34] Daniel said what's the matter I'm you
[1:32:37] huh God your king and anything you need
[1:32:40] we get it
[1:32:42] but I want a king
[1:32:45] I want to be like the rest of them
[1:32:50] really kind of odd in this message that

[1:32:56] lead us today you're not hearing too
[1:32:59] much of that because you're not they're
[1:33:01] not going to publicly put it out which
[1:33:04] is Brother Ray and going back maybe he
[1:33:06] can back up far enough

[1:33:11] when they were talking about who was
[1:33:15] supposed to lead the bride
[1:33:18] I thought they were talking about who's
[1:33:20] the Elijah to take over after brother
[1:33:22] Ryan was gone
[1:33:23] well this one isn't it this one isn't it
[1:33:26] this isn't it
[1:33:35] jockeying for position

[1:40:56] our own ideas and talks to what we think
[1:40:59] about something is but
[1:41:02] like I told him I said brother Bob I
[1:41:05] believe and I do I believe I believe
[1:41:06] every Minister has ever called of God
[1:41:10] has a special scriptural
[1:41:14] adult whatever you want to call it
[1:41:16] revelation
[1:41:18] is specifically for them your brain
[1:41:20] that's right
[1:41:22] and though I may preach on it
[1:41:24] many times
[1:41:26] that it will not do the effects
[1:41:30] that is supposed to be
[1:41:32] it's like a song A lot of times you know
[1:41:34] who was it Jimmy Davis sung the come
[1:41:37] home come home is that the one
[1:41:46] it wasn't the one that met the great
[1:41:48] speckleberg

[1:41:53] could ever sing it like that

[1:41:57] bring that was the anointing the thing
[1:42:01] and run around said God may choose you

[1:42:09] service well I'm just only still trying
[1:42:12] to find a 30-minute sermon that's right
[1:42:14] now to keep on preaching I find that one
