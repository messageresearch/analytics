and I want to see him man it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn where we've been in Jonah 2 and then we'll go to Luke 24 Jonah to Luke 24 we heard the announcements there I know there's a lot of sickness and things among us and a lot of flus and bugs and troubles and things like that so just pray one for another the Lord would reach down and touch us all because we were all needed there wife has been coughing and her sinuses or bronchitis or whatever you know it's just keeps heard of going all the time on that and you know you can take all the medicine you want to fart it just doesn't do much good anymore for what you do and you're done war out and that's you no matter how old you are you're subject to all of these things but just remember to pray for all of the sickness just pray at everybody I that's what I do I just pray Lord you be with everybody because it's a that's a way of doing it we had a good time over to fellowship meeting yesterday in in Alabama brother Douglas brother Richard Douglas priest he done a good job ministering unto us some had a good time in fellowship and all like that the Lord willing brother Lewis will be ministering this coming Wednesday we're sorry that we missed this last Wednesday but I hope y'all done what we done we were just we just gathered together as a whole family and ate supper together and and we put on the message of the Intervale or while God's people are so talked about is the title of it I had requested that you listened to that message and so we just as a family we just sit down in the living room at Terrance's and and listen to that you know and had our service and things of that way and I hope you hope you've had an opportunity to listen to that message because there's a lot of things said in that message that will be very very needful as we continue on through this part series that we're on talking about salvation it would be very needful to to you to listen to it because if you listen intently Levine you know what brother Brown does you know he'll bring the man from this to say this about that message where you listen to it he brings a man to justification sanctification baptism on the whole to go outer Court inner court Holy of Holies all right he explains that but you got to listen real carefully after a while he has that same man that he's put behind the veil back out into the outer court and carries him back through again and see if you don't listen like that you're gonna miss the whole thoughts of of adoptions or or any things about the new birth you're going to miss it if you don't listen to what he's saying then that way it's not me saying it you just listen and you haven't because see in the natural type nobody but our Jew could go into that outer Court let alone the inner court or behind the veil only as you could go remember they got on the fall about it ringing Peter in you know see because that was a strict rule that's what I'm saying then you you've got to get that part and get him over here then you come back start up statue of perfect man with the same guy so if you'll just listen that away I tell you that ahead of time and if you listen with that thought you will see why the Prophet will make statements that seemingly are contradictory to the other statements that he will make even in the same paragraph you know or sometimes in the same sentence they put you listen it's not contradictory he's explaining something you know get that to you to do okay and to another thing I might make sure we listen always to the hi services and the other day I said that the two sons of Naomi were Gentiles I meant to say their wives were Gentiles not the two sons they were Naomi's and her husband they were Jews we call it you know Israelites whatever you'd call it it was Ruth and what would her name Obed know Ruth is now missed the two daughter-in-laws route was ruth and obed i guess was anyhow anyhow the two that were there so just you know I correct that were somebody listening they said boy he don't know what he's talkin about cuz the two sons of Naomi words were part of the Jewish race and in doing but anyhow we're not all perfect but I'll ask you a question do you know what the what is the word for that in other words the way they tell whether a document a book or anything is authentic do you know the one test it goes through first of being authentic and they go by it stronger than they do anything else in other words you write a book you somebody write a book and they say well so and so wrote this book and you say no they didn't because the test you put on the book to see whether it's real or not is to see how many contradictions how many things that are said that are not worded exactly that's the test now you you don't do it with a book find out because when you take a book and it comes out perfect with no contradictions that means somebody has tampered with it and corrected all of the things that were said wrong check it out to me you'll find out that we make our most I listen to these brothers and you know they all life it mean everybody does about something like that making a mistake well with Daddy 77 and I hear Wayde and Bob and Louise and an errand and and they take a word and it goes 90 miles thataway you know I said you know they doing same thing I do there because your brain gets ahead of your mouth and when your brain gets ahead of your mouth you're gonna say things that's not right but you know what that way you'll find that worse original or not that's my point okay so just think about that okay Jonah - and Luke father we thank you for your grace and your love father unto us we thank you for everything and we just ask you to bless us now as we read your word and Lord that we may comment upon your word and try to get the people to see what is upon our hearts and our thoughts we love you and we thank you just reach down and and touch the people you promised it we can depend upon that code you said you sent your word and healed us so if we've nothing else we pick up the Bible and read by your stripes we are healed that is your word and you will honor that word when we believe it and accept it so have your way with all of these sicknesses and things and just let your light shine in our hearts and lives we love you and we thank you in Jesus name okay Jonah oh yeah right we got an announcement boy's brother boys class since sister Monica's class will practice at 12:45 okay get it for the boys class versus sister Monica's class practice 12:45 okay but I will sanctify I'm excused I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land remember our point salvation deliver it Jonah come out alright let's go now and we'll try to get this thought if we get far enough I don't will carry it later but from Luke 24 word will begin at 44 you read up above and and everything and get to text and authority and this is after his resurrection and he's eating the fish with them and the things you know and then he tells him and he said them to them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me now what was all of the Old Testament here's the thought of the morning what was all of the Old Testament taught and shadows of what was to come we've emphasized it over and over and over the natural story was to Abraham and his lineage he didn't mention salvation it was natural lineage land and people right then that is an example of the salvation that they receive by believing on the Lord and it supplies them a place to go to all right everybody with me they then everything in the Old Testament stops and shatters that's what he's saying to them you know now you remember this is to fulfill those time what's then open neither understanding that they might understand the scripture this is before now Jesus Christ came back you know I stood before the coming of the Holy Ghost this is a prior to that right at that point then open he their understanding that they might understand the scripture rise the new birth he opened her understanding there was no new birth there because there was no Jesus Christ returned to give it all right this is his point of where he was tired and said unto them thus it is written and thus it birth of Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and you are witnesses of these things okay you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word all right now still speaking of salvation and we're still I've tried to get over to the New Testament talks that I want to bring but I keep coming in two spots and said I've got to say something here I've got to say something here you know to make sure you don't misunderstand where we're at all right so now we're still talking about the Old Testament now remember listen you say to people of the world and the people this message you say turn to the first book of the New Testament and then you start reading in acts 1 and a lot of the congregation is in Matthew 1 right now we're to note that in the Baptist Church what we did I mean we talked about those things you know that the New Testament but didn't begin until the day after the death of the testator that's Scripture so the New Testament never begun in Matthew Matthew was still Jesus at that time was fulfilling the scriptures or Galatians I get it written down here to me where he came under the law to redeem them that were under the law so he had to come under the law Matthew Mark Luke and John was still before or right you know a little bit right at the end of Matt the gospel they talk about the resurrection but they don't talk about the coming of the Holy Ghost that struck under their Pentecost all right now so then you remember that we're all being then types and shadows but remember our point I keep emphasizing this if the tops and the shadows the top in the shadow you can a little bit of difference in sometimes when you're saying it because you take a canoe is the top of a big ocean liner well there's a vast difference between the truth but they have the same principle that will float they will carry people etc etc all right now watch that after a while when we get down to speaking on something that is going to be very valuable to us if we'll listen all right and we've get into partial realization compared to perfect realization remember the whole thought that we've been on this whole series whatever you start with you must carry it into the New Testament Old Testament it was the blood of bulls and goats right but in the New Testament of blood of Jesus Christ right see now still the blood it's still the doing this is a type of this over here everything we are in our life as a type of that's reading I love Malachi 4 you notice Malachi 3 4 and right 2 though it says what remember ye he's in in the Old Testament you know in that form Malachi and what was it saying remember you the law of Moses then he starts talking about the coming of Elijah what's the lives are going to do restore all the word remember you the law of Moses remember the word remember the Ten Commandments wouldn't a book of rules is a revelation of God to the people which they took it for the wrong all right now follow me then okay then we we say that all back Dyer will see it typed them because the Old Testament Laura it dealt with the land and the people and who it belonged to and what they're done in this and following it down through this group of people etc but you had no new birth you had no form in that we'll get to it in a minute where the Prophet said that there wasn't even in Redemption now we know he's not saying that there wasn't something back there of salvation he's got his point he's making a point of illustration so listen to that point C alright but what is salvation based upon starting back dire and holding it and it'll bring it on over to here believing right the very first key is to believing I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved believe in their salvation dur their land getting their their inheritances or their everything under the tops and shadows would ever get into believing you know what not believing all of God you know but believing in that God cuz Hebrews says he that comes to God must believe that he is alright now abraham believed God is he didn't believe God was because he believed he was he went back to his idols because that's where he come from alright but he believes in something real salvation is in something that's real to you and I it's not just an imagination or a thought or or shaking a hand or I done this or I done that you know it's on the basis of whether or not you can believe God is speaking to you I mean he caught one man in the days of Abraham in a world of billions of people one man you know what that one man had to believe it they can we can we believe it all right but those people back guard had to believe now what's their life's message they had to believe that God was speaking to them and that his speaking to them was calling them unto Him for whatever the purpose was the land the doings are there everything else but it what they had to believe and remember the last message was about your calling an election to make it sure then many are called but few are chosen that we can say well I've got a call on my life brother branham said that was the worst problem Satan could do because he'll tell you when you got it that you don't got it and he'll tell you when you don't got it did you have God right that's the way Satan will attacked us he never tells you you got something when you got something right he'll tell you you don't have it got the code that's his whole point all right now see they had to believe that God was speaking to them and calling them to step forth and do a certain thing oh you know it you could pick out any of them David see he had to believe it and his believing made a confidence within him that he had no fear of the line the buyer or Goliath or anything you know why because he was believing he believed that God would be there huh and it would be real to him all right now so remember you're calling me he called the disciples they're in morale so he called Judas and told him come follow but Judas notice colors is we'll get to a little more in the message we're going on all right then believing now try to pull that message in that God is calling you for a specific thing not to just well I believe the message well I go to church and I've been you know I've got a gold star for missing church well that's all well and wonderful but that don't save you me we want to make those forms of something to make a salvation I was talking to a man night work one time and I noticed this this guy's walked over where we were at and we were talking about something I forgot what it was but anyhow we were talking and all at once he quoted the scripture that was 40 miles away from what we were talking about it was so far away till it you know until I really turned her head looked at him I said what is that got to do what we're talking about you know what he said he said I just wanted you to know that I go to church Ted everybody saying I just wanted you to know that I go to church well I was shocked in all right but now listen they had a salvation back in that Old Testament remember they had a repentance not necessarily to get down and pray that in the repent as we think maybe and call out Jesus or whatever was but they believed in God and they tried to repent of what they were doing and they even had the fact that they had to follow to that by the law and the keepings and their doings in their life and they couldn't do this and etc but they had a repentance back there throughout the Old Testament had a repentance and they had a fact of believing God called them alright they had a cleansing in their life we'll get to these later cuz it's time to to together alright and they were justified by believing on God huh they were sanctified by cleansing and setting them aside from the world and especially after the giving of the law and I said that correctly after the law coming into being you had a record in different things so you did have a lot more maybe cleansing of people and trying to keep their self cleaned after the law came into existence and that was what it was added for because the scripture said it was given because of the transgression of mankind alright now so first step in salvation is believing that God is real believing that he's speaking to you not to everybody do you personal all right they believe he's real believing that he is speaking and talking to you and that has some reason for calling you know he has some some happening dire all right now see not just to believe on a God or that there is a odd somewhere you know or whatever but to have a reality and thoughts in your mind of a God that lives right now we're still the Old Testament right we haven't come to salvation in the New Testament we're still under the salvation of the Old Testament part of talking about it all right now then to know that God in that part back there he was speaking of what would later come into being not the whole Old Testament is speaking of what would come into being at a later date all right so now let's pick up if we can the thoughts of moving from now be careful with the wording listen we're going to be talking in this message about the disciples right and God coming to them gonna ask you a question before we start do you believe this happened or maybe they were do have to read the Bible do you know the disciples were three and a half years following the Lord Jesus right and not one of them had a born-again experience code it couldn't be done until Jesus came in first if I now come on that's valuable but I think they had a salvation well let me ask you a question if you think they had a salvation like you think they had a salvation like we were told in the denominations that they had come on they thought they had that salvation back there if it was that form of salvation well if Judas went to justification and sanctification why wasn't he saved I've always told you you can think what you won't do about this old boy Judas Iscariot was a fine fellow must have been now I know what the Bible says that he was who he was a thief from the beginning and Jesus knew about right but you know nobody else didn't know about it but you know we say Judas was this that didn't look what he does will you tell me what the Year done I mean you have no record of Jesus getting I mean of Judas getting vehemently upset and starting to cursing and things and claiming not even to know Jesus but Peter did but you know I love the scripture cause Jesus had already said said Peter it's the devil has taught you in other word and said he's gonna pull you and drag you down but said what he said I've prayed for you so now you decide what you want to between Jesus and Judas I mean I'm not one of these Judas days and people in the days and trying to make Judas a fine guy no he was just like all the rest of them but all the rest of them are just like him Yeah right alright now let's talk about the disciples moving up from just saying oh now listen to my point you had the salvation of the people or deliverance isn't a and under under those people of Abraham and things it was all natural things of land and this that or the other now that would speak off the salvation that would come to bring it more into mankind right that would speak of the New Testament coming forth but we've got to have a wedge in between and that's where your disciples fall into a situation that they're not talking about Co Jesus never told them come follow me and I'll give you land in houses now remember what he said in other words he said come follow me and leave every bit of that am i right did he not tell him come follow me and lay down all these things believe you mama leave you daddy it's moving up into a rim of bringing salvation more into reality that it would start dealing with man and his doings instead of land and opportunity to do this or whatever it would move up from Abraham being promised all of this land it would move up to Peter him giving up all land but it would move into a salvation for them that would be greater than Abraham could ever think of are you with me so then when you would start with the disciples so I emphasize that those disciples were not under the New Testament the New Testament never begun until the book of Acts now come on those disciples were still under the law Jesus was under the law he had to pay the price of the law he had to go and do everything according to the law he was circumcised on the eighth day he with all of the things that the law required and even when he here one to remember what he said he said go off for the offering of Moses right there was no new born again it was no born to get experience in Matthew Mark Luke and John it was only types and shadows of it but remember what was taking place was a wonderful types and shadows as the tops in the shadows of the land and the things to Abraham and them showed that it would come to a place that the disciples would walk with Almighty God and have a personal contact with him greater than to listen greater than Abraham had even though he saw God met him and thing but here comes God down now to the disciples in human flesh and walks upon the shores of Galilee with the disciples a lot greater isn't it are you listening I've tried to explain it over and over to you you got to take this and start with it and let it grow it's always a constant upward growing it's like the new birth here at faith but then you've got to grow into the stature of a perfect man and that's worth it I wanted you to listen go to remember the message enter Intervale is really I say interval in but it's interval but it's you know while God's people still tossed about 56 he was already preaching the stature of a perfect man but he wasn't calling it that because he didn't know to call it that you said well how do you know code I can go to statue of a perfect man in quoting he said I just got these scriptures the other day you know add to your faith virtue or knowledge I just got these scriptures the other day on something that I going to speak on the he knew in 56 that there was more to it than just a new birth he knew better than the old Baptist we get everything when we believe he knew better than the Pentecostals that got everything shouted out when they bleed he already knew you know about the things of the Word of God and a growth development of that person in 56 so what do you think he was doing 456 262 then it comes in approaches in stature of a perfect now listen Church the disciples the Lord came himself personally and live with them you know ate with him fed them you know they got to eat of the benefits of the fish that was created this and out of the other oh no you know he didn't just tell him say come on boys and follow me and y'all dig up as much as you can along the way he fed him he took care of them for three and a half years who paid the bills for those food that they was going after didn't it say one time somebody sent him into the to buy food Judas remember the guy was the money he was the one to go in to buy the food all right and see he fed them he done all the things well don't you realize that maybe you know we look at Nicodemus and we say Nicodemus is this and the kid don't you know those disciples knew all about Nicodemus come on math you must have known it or which one rocks it he must have known it or you know John is the one where he says you must be born again he must have known about Nicodemus you understand what I'm saying they live with him for three and a half years they witnessed the signs and the wonders they witnessed the dead raised the sick healed and heard the gospel right for three and a half years so here's the question oh don't ask a moment ago you never thought about that it took them three and a half years to come to salvation it took one 30 minute sermon on the day of Pentecost and a group of people come to the born-again experience why why what Italy disciples come to salvation when immediately after the coming of the Holy Ghost it took 130 minute I'm just saying 30 minutes you don't come about you can read whatever might have been a 5 minute sermon and they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they go over to the warehouse of canoes is that the one where they they just went over and they heard the message and they said can we forbid these to be baptized that has received the Holy Ghost that we did at the beginning you don't never think like 3 and 1/2 years compared with a 30 second 30 minute sermon and the same Holy Ghost comes I know it I've explained it over and over we'll get back to it when that 120 the Upper Room they received the Holy Ghost at a higher place than the ones that received it on the day of Pentecost they just heard one sermon we don't have time to try to preach all of that over again if you want to know anything about that ask me later all right but now listen surely they heard of Nicodemus and all of the things that Jesus Christ had done and they came to are in the scriptures until that say now we believe now we believe that no man has to do this that or the other to you people you know just different ones we believe that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God they were great believers they've seen all the signs and the wonders of the dead raise the sick Hill food multiply all kind of things they were believers but they didn't believe didn't believe enough evidently not as I'm believed enough to bring the Holy Ghost on them right well all it is brother this is we believe it and I got the Holy Ghost when I believe now show me that any word in the Bible you know we'll get back to it eventually that there is places young okay but we're trying to make a point trying to make a point to you and I to think about something I would to God I have always preached this away and I always been that way so don't worry about it's always from the beginning I've always said I wish I could preach until everybody in this building would think about whether or not they're saved and would consider your own self to see whether you are not I've come through all of them great expression well you can't tell me I ain't born again I've been following this message 40 years so had Judas and he was a believer why did not his believing carry him home okay I've always said it not a lot to worry about it not flying if Judas Iscariot hadn't went out and hung yourself walked over to the shop would and went with him a way could have been made but he could have shortened brother branham claims and it says he said he failed to go dependent house he said he showed his colors we'll get to that now they may not have understood the things that Jesus spoke of the kingdom and the coming of the kingdom because they wondered in question everything he would say right every time he'd bring out a parable they would want him later to explain it they couldn't follow the parables that he would be giving there were very very simple things but they couldn't follow it they knew that they were personally called you ever heard this in the message I remember a brother they wouldn't didn't have too good of a batting average on his life and things and with this other brother said I gotta let him preach too called brother Branham ordained him I'm stating facts I'm worried about it just get the point a lot of people in this message believe they're safe cause brother Branham spoke to them about something brother branham told me what to preach this one brother he used to do that everywhere he went and he was one of those guys that remember that some of you ain't never heard about it but they had seven men they were supposed to bend the seven thunders you know and this was one of the guys that supposed to been one of the thunders alright and he kept saying that well I'm just one of them kind of guys it's just a little I don't have the determine that brother branham had to be able to figure out something figured out no but I got my way of doing it I'll pick you till I get it so one day I couldn't ever get him to answer me and and he'd say when he preached he said the Prophet told me what to preach in Iyengar preach it we'll never find the building what'd he tell him did he tell him the thunders did he tell him to see you did he tell him 7uu did he tell him this so I one day I just finally asking I listen brother I've heard you make that statement would you mind telling me what brother Ron told you to preach you know what he said he said brother Branham told me to preach hell firing it hot and it was exactly what he said he said brother round told me to preach Hellfire in it hot you know what he told every preacher ever ordained a priest hell fire a hot ok listen they might not have understood what was being taught but they begin to believe and they begin to see the signs and the miracles the wonders they heard his teachings and they begin to follow him about some of the things he would speak off in his kingdom and what it would be and they would say you know even one sister you know that my two sons might sit with thee in thy kingdom they'd heard so much about a kingdom until they were beginning to be concerned and they realized he was speaking of something different from what it was on earth and like I said about the ruler you know Pilate when he got to explaining to to to pilot what he was darf our pilot said no probably I'd like to have a whole kingdom full of guys like this because he ain't talking about anyway hindering me he's trying to tell my people how to be good now even that's paraphrasing words but you know what happened he wound up and said I find no fault in this man no justification for killing him right but they got overruled you know that all right but they saw the signs and the wonders they heard others commenting about that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God was that what Peter said during in Matthew about 13 or 16 or what it in a lot of people departing to be the Christ the Son of the Living God other than just Peter but that didn't mean they were born again but they were believers you realized they held what they're believing for three and a half years they believed enough till they walked away from their families they believed enough till they quit their jobs they believed enough to rest with him and that hollering scream were you at when they were out on the sea because they knew he was the only one there would be any help right pretty good followers we'll get to it later pretty good believers are you going to tell them they were lost no I'm going to tell them that they're believing is what finally brought them to an upper room experience they're believing they're believing for the day they started they're calling to all of the time they believed him when he said okay I've resurrected I've done this I'm going away go to the upper room and wait you know the story they got a Pernice in will we order just take it by faith somebody said no no he told us to wait and we ain't got it in other words Rock I've always said in plain language somebody over in the side of where I said I believe we've got it we'll take it by faith he said okay you go out first there outside that door waiting to kill you you number one go they all sat down and shut up and said we ain't got what he said because from my understanding about what he was saying we're going to get is they get a power I'm on high is that what he said to him in the resurrection did he tell them they'd received these things and they said we ain't got it so they waited til they got it all right now see they believed until they entered the first stage in the plan of their salvation and that first stage would be that according to Luke I think it's 2447 we read that repentance and remission of sins would be preached in his name they begin to believe and come to a position to get baptized right they followed on with the Lord in their lives but it was enough to bring them to a repentance and bring them to what would be called justification which would chop off their PI sins no it would bring them to make believers out of them it would bring them to a sanctification in Saint John 17 sanctify them through thy truth they had heard the truth they'd walk with it for three and a half years they were cleansed and set aside by that message Jesus had brought unto them pretty good believer pretty good followers gave up everything they had and went on with the Lord we know at least Peter had a wife no nobody's on the rest of him but Peter had a wife right he had a mother-in-law he's listed in the Bible you know Peter had a mother-in-law but listen being justified Roman says freely by the grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus now what brought them to repentance the Bible says that the goodness of God is what leads you to repentance and here's Jesus out there every day giving away right you didn't say come on fellas sneak around over here in the corner and I'll give you a little food no he said take everybody that's out here set them down with feed the whole 5000 they couldn't understand those things we get they believed it until they finally said we believe then nobody has to tell you nobody has to tell you we've got to place how about this oh we got that far we claim the baptism the Holy Ghost and can't lie straight out of here oh brother Dale you're talking about me yes does that solve the problem are you guilty yes then I you're the one I'm talking about well you ain't me code I've been here for years oh you did good shake come on get the point without the Holy Ghost and I quote brother Branham which one was it Leslie who did he name was a job which one was it did he 90 said he survived without the baptism when the Holy Ghost all of those of the years and how much more should we we might prove we're not believers it might be like I said a moment ago that I would to God I could preach that we could all realize we're lost you know why because we could do something about it if we don't realize we're lost when you're gonna do nothing about it we're gonna go right on straight to hell thinking we're going to have it right I would that I could preach that we could all find out you know that that sister on blasphemous names we would snigger at her he didn't realize she had the new birth she didn't I wouldn't a prophet it said she had it read blasphemous names and find out but you know what she was concerned whether she had the Holy Ghost because of the way he was preaching about the Holy Ghost she had to give the signs of wonders and things probably in her life but evidently she had caught on to brother branham's preaching of the baptism of the holy ghost and how that you could have these anointings how you could have these situations how that it wasn't speaking in tongues and wasn't signs and wonders that you depend on she had come to a position that she wondered what if she was saved on a come on Church he said you said well you bring out things I bring out something like that you know it's good old Baptist I mean a good old bad this is in here today don't raise your hand just because the rest of you don't say I ain't Baptist you know what a good old bad dish would say I can't now that that water baptism name of Lord Jesus Christ now you we can't go that way cause jesus said father son hung up and said if a tie and and that that one God y'all got you know we can't do that because they're quoting scripture because if we deny the father with the neither son that's Scripture maybe it might be son and father has crossed over but get the point it's there in the scriptures if I deny that I'm saved that means I'm lost you know what if that's the thought you got can I say it without hurting your feelings too bad and I don't care if it does and hope it does you are lost if that's all you've got it's a great bellowing point of unsaved you know my statement for 40 years I'd rather go all of my life seeking after God and find out in the end of it I had him all alone then to go all in my life and not seek after God and get down to the end find out I didn't have him oh that can't be me brother Dale I know I'm saved we getting upset about who are you trying to convince right who are you trying to convince yourself or me I would to God that we'd ever one read that blasphemous named over and over and get what that sister was saying she was really saying in other words the way brother Branham you're preaching it and the Holy Ghost said if we don't have it like that then we don't have it and she worried to whether she had it or not no order but I know that see I've been through all of it come on folks well I can't I can't turn out that I'm I can't do that I'm saved if I I won't even take no thoughts that I ain't saved that's a good statement they ain't worth two cents in the gospel I won't to see it it was always in the Bible we need we need brother brother said we got too much is that his word at far we're afraid to listen that's what people don't want to listen brother that afraid to listen to me the afraid they might wind up against a brick wall somewhere and don't know whether they're saved or not well that's alright now I'll keep right on preaching it don't Teil something happens either way but therefore being justified freely by faith we have a redemptive part to come with Jesus Christ all right but what about the disciples no what about the disciples or were they the disciples and what did the three and a half years finally bring him to what about it it wasn't just you to sit left you remember they're saving the others you know remember there was a lot of people in there that left and you know there's a lot of them I'd like the way brother Bradley straightened out as he was appalled with the what was the one Paul did enough he know the one that went away from him Dimas but Wren said I don't think Dimas went back in the world he didn't go anymore nopal did but all right now listen listen to what your prophet says that three and a half years of the minister Jesus Christ brought the disciples to a great position okay go ahead to number one questions and answers 19:54 and law having a shadow you talked about the Christian Brothers and the things you know in the new Durst that Jesus told Peter after he would been the apostle of them they've been justified by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ now whatever you want to put their justification chop off your Pisceans whatever lump it to whatever thought you want it simply means it goes through all that a justification chops off you pi sins they'd been sanctified through the truth he was the truth then he said and give them power they went forth to preach the gospel they begun great gifts that was in them was being made anybody read was it's a great gifts and things was being made super early or in a shallow way in other words in a shallow way manifested but he said now the next thing you got to do is to make this thing grow with the disciples they were justified by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ they were sanctified through the truth and he was the truth and they got 3.5 years of ministry for that to sanctified okay what about this one go ahead number two questions and answers on Genesis there was Judas Iscariot was justified by faith and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and was baptized the Bible said Jesus baptizing disciples his disciples all right now instead of listening to anything you know what happens when that statements read well I I think did Jesus baptized the disciple drew the disciple baptized Jesus or who baptized who or who got to see right now some of yous done cut off any thought about Judas being right there you didn't got in to arguing over whether Jesus baptized them or they baptized each other or what happened here with art that's the great message people well brother Dale I didn't think of that and maybe somebody else to you the Bible said Jesus baptized her to stop of Jews John all right John 17:17 before he could send them out he said sanctify them father through the truth before we sent him out now thy word is the truth and he was the word even before the atonement was made in other words as a preview father of my shed blood I sanctify them i watch him he gave them power against unclean spirits and they went out and they cast out Devils is that right and they healed the sick that right and they come back sanctified rejoicing jumping shouting and praising God is that right and said even the devil's is subject to us and Jesus said don't you rejoice because the Devils are subject you but rejoice because your names are written in the book of heaven is that right and Judas Iscariot was right with them one of them called out sanctified in his name written in the Lamb's Book of Life even it couldn't be in the last look like it had to be there it's gotta be there see you stopped again you've cut the whole thing off you're not listening to the message read Matthew 10 and see if that's not right he called each one of them and Judas and every one of them right down there he sent them out giving them power against unclean spirit that was before Calvary now come on he gave them power and Judas Iscariot was right there woodland and Judas went to justification and sanctification okay go ahead to the next one mark of the beast and the seal of God he called his disciples by justification he sanctified them in st. John 17:17 gave them power against unclean spirits and they went out and cast out devils come back rejoicing you know don't worry John Judas was just a bigger duck in the pond as the rest of them was he come right along through justification went out through sanctification prayed for the sick had gave great results but when he come to Pentecost he showed his colors Judas the God we think was a crook that we think was all of this I've preached my understanding of that come on I can read the Bible to you when they were in the upper room the spirit entered Judas ricci Bible I'm talking about the holy spirit that the spirit entered Judas and took him away you know he was doing a pretty good job and killed in oh yeah he was a crook all the time but only Jesus knew what he was all right are you following me now listen to what he says number four I got them set up two we're gonna flip flop in a minute because of a point I'm wanting to bring and look what he says now man told me one day he said I can't see that I said I can you can be sanctified without being justified we spend all the rest of the evening talking on that he didn't say you can be sanctified I justified that being you know he what they say you me sanctified without being justified you can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without receiving the Holy Ghost that's exactly and John dopplers and John was sanctified to give the power to cast out devils and still doubt didn't have the Holy Ghost he sure had to go up to Pentecost and wait till the Holy Ghost come that's where Judas showed his colors see how that spirit worked its way through justification and sanctification but when it come to the end he showed his colors now he called to the Spirit worked his way up through that Judas is character we know that justification means chops off you pass in sanctification means cleanse and set aside sanctification really if you only get down to it and break it on down that's true the opening of the word but you realize sanctification is a point to work that the word comes within you and takes out the things that you were doing is that clear enough see justification chops off your pie sins you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham says a few strong he said it does nothing to your nature he said all it does is remit your sins sanctification starts to working upon your nature because it starts a cleansing and you can have people to quit drinking quit smoking quit line quit stealing and still committing adultery till you can be sanctified not be totally justified no problem your prophets not wrong you just give him a little time to think about what he's saying it'll come out but not think about it we all know these scriptures but do we realize it okay good number five now we know in John what it says because he said he said to her the Holy Ghost still had not been given all right now we know what it says he believed it only in the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified now you got to come to the death burial resurrection glorification we were tested discussing this going over to the minister the meeting yesterday and he had to go up he told Mary don't touch me I'm not yet ascended he had to go up deposit the body lift it on the throne then he could come back to be with the disciples now be careful you ain't listening he went up and left the body what came back to earth the glorified body but did that do away with the body laying on the throne oh you're missing it you got to have the body laying on the throne for the pay in the prize leave it on the throne until it rises to come again and then we meet him in the air see the message is right but we get it all into our won't understand this what does that make it wrong does that make it wrong cuz we don't understand it I mean we had eggs and toast this morning for breakfast well I don't understand how that goes in my systems and does all these like especially the one I don't understand know life when it makes me fat I've got so fat until my belly button sticking out and I happened to be sitting with my shirt pulled over to the side the other day and little Lilly looked over the iron she said Papa you know how no belly button I said I do is just pushed out honey it's your life where you're thinking settle you down to where you're thinking okay that's the purpose of doing that you'll find out one of these days all great speakers have an ability to make you like for a minute to try to clear your thoughts to where you'll sit down and listen so I'm one of the great speakers okay that's good go ahead a number see it let's get started let's get a thought all right look what he said on the unveiling of God before any man walked in behind that veil now watch it was sudden death anybody let us show you they didn't have eternal life back guard listen that right there is enough if you don't believe it if you're still questioning whether it had he turn alive in the Old Testament remember if that had eternal life I'm quoting the rest of it in a minute if they had eternal life they could walk behind the veil because you now in the New Testament if you do not go behind the veil you're lost in the Old Testament you went behind the veil you was dead in the New Testament quoting brother Branham so you do what you thought he said we don't go behind the veil now he said well off he's the words once death to go behind he said now it's death to not go behind I'm quoting him so come on we look but if any man walk behind that veil it was sudden death why cause the blood of bulls and goats and all that what you're gonna get a lesson here in a minute see if you can if you can receive it to walk behind him skins even one of the priests sons tried to do it one time and died don't go behind that veil the man that walked behind why there was no redemption yet in that there's no redemption yet in that it was potentially in the Old Testament Redemption was potential or potentially which I think it's in here or if not we'll get in a minute the word potentially means it's not exactly the full story but remember potentially is a type of an answer type potentially it means you have the beginning of what you need if you want an oak tree and I give you an acorn what have you got potentially you've got an oak tree but what if you want an oak tree and I give your watermelon seed it don't work so remember my story over and over all the Old Testament tops of the new all it was back here you can't change it when you come over here there's got to be a further advancement or we'll get we'll get to it today I don't know what I'm gonna finish this but we'll get to it the Lord within next weekend of partial realization compared to perfect realization remember whatever worked back tyre for Dean was got to be working for us now but it's just a deeper meaning everybody with me don't look what he said even one of the priests went behind her he don't he died while there was no redemption yet in that it was potentially it was just potential in anything Meredith anything potential is not the real thing yet he didn't say it wasn't real it's not the real thing yet you get in a little boat and you go down the lake it ain't yet a big ocean liner but it's a travel mechanism come on anything potential is not the real time yet see just potentially it was redemptions not sins was covered now what's he not owe me didn't he change it remitted rather not remitted remitted is divorced and put away and so the blood of sheep and goats could not do that so Jehovah was hid behind a veil and now back behind this veil where he was hid to enter into that a man drop dead to try to enter but - now if we don't go behind the veil we're already dead the only way you can get born again is go behind the veil okay all right let me check see if I can stop okay let's get the next one and we'll quit because this is where I told him we'd flip-flop okay number seven taken from the Mesa Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now the prophets could not be sanctified now listen then he says potentially now he'll explain it they were potentially the prophets were potentially sanctified now you'll see that in a minute because that's just when he stopped it he was making his stopping and he's bought backed up do you read it for yourself come on look now the prophets could not be sanctified potentially by the offering of a bull or an ox or something or sheep or a heifer they were potentially under that blood as a brother both gallantly as presented that they could be sanctified potentially under looking forward to the atonement being made perfect for under the blood of bulls and when the bull died or the heifer died or the Sheep died the life in that blood could not come back on the prophet because it was animal's life an animal's life would not bring the profit to an animal now listen in the Old Testament they were potential that's the type of shadow keep that thought there's a lot more than you that have this notes hold on to them those are gonna need them next Sunday don't have to rerun them potentially is something that's we think potentially is something that's not real but no no you're getting at it wrong way if you say you have an O an acorn potentially you have an oak tree which you got a lot to go through to get the oak tree but now you can't start without the Acorn for the oak tree right so the Old Testament salvation now listen was under the blood of bulls and goats Jesus Christ had not been crucified so until that come forward they were only potentially justified and potentially sanctified they never received the baptism with all the ghosts no and what they had was enough to hold them for the time but not enough to bring Redemption to the full plan all right so think about potentially you know that the Bible speaks of it in the Prophet says we're potentially raised so you see where we're going we're potentially right what you know what we still here hey you know but saying you're potentially raised don't raise yet one foot right you still here but we're potentially now you want to deny what you got no because I got what will take me to the perfect reality - we'll back up to partial realization comparing with perfect realization and bring out a few thoughts potentially those Old Testament Saints because under the blood of bulls and goats you could only have a potential now don't worry about it I've got what the Prophet said so we'll just keep on going you know that Adam potentially I had to hold a go I'm quoting brother branham I'll let you wait you they've gotten the message just don't buy some round too much lately you can read it I didn't say that your prophet did what is it potential then brother Dale it's something that you start with but remember in the oak tree you start with the Acorn that's just as real as the oak tree it just ain't come into being yet you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost right here at faith and born again potentially you have these things but they're not in manifestation you have a part of these things a potential a potential you have the part of these things but you don't have it in full reality you said brother Dale you the way you talk see the new birth that you receive the new birth the 3,000 outside received on the day of Pentecost was the eternal life into the body of Jesus Christ by salvation we were the only potential to watch 120 had from the upper room why because they'd been taught three and a half years and the Holy Ghost fell put them where it said Holy Spirit on the pyramid I'm quoting brother Branham but see the five they're the three thousand outside only received a new birth but it made them sealed into the body of Christ don't you wish you could think about that we were all full-grown wouldn't it be something to think I'm a fool growing in the God brother Dale I'll tell you what I got everything like I told y'all sitting with two brothers one time one of them said I got everything when I believed in this message and got the whole ego said I got everything I don't have to get nothing the other brother looked at him and said when you've got whatever you got you didn't get all of it and you don't have it yet I said with y'all two brothers mind if I stay in the middle between the two of you no you said you got everything and you said he ain't got nothing I said you mind if I stay in the middle and believe that that brothers got a point about what he said and that brothers got a point about what he's saying but you got to get them together in the middle somewhere what about it you asked me for an oak tree I'll give you an acre have you ever studied the message just enough to know you know the Lutheran's potentially now this is one's gonna take a while to explain I don't call him brother Brandon the Lutheran's potentially had the Holy Spirit now you tell me that the Lutheran didn't have the Newburgh now you you sell me brother Brown I'm saying that the Lutheran didn't have nothing I'll quote you the big man from down south years ago said he couldn't preach no era stood right here and said he said them Pentecostals said David sweat for false I had just explained it to him in the building down and look and gills will lower heat and supper code he'd made that statement I said brother I said brother branham said them elusive Street Pentecost had the baptism when the Holy Ghost the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that come on the day of Pentecost he come right here and said they didn't have it you know what that didn't change me to believe what he said I believe what brother around say I may not be able to explain it may I be like this started off with the Apostles come on musician maybe like I started off with the Apostles they didn't understand everything Jesus talking about but they knew enough to say one time where can we go thou hast the words of eternal life and work and we go that's all I've ever said in this message I don't understand everything though where can we go you tell me that some man I thought we supposed to follow some guy over here something over there I just can't follow them I just can't go that route why the ACOTA I can't believe the way they believe that's what I told it to so man when he was trying to I said I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying I don't believe what you say I can't understand what you're saying I said but now I'm not gonna tell you you're wrong that's when you and God but I'm gonna tell you that I don't believe it that way I don't understand you better what well what else could I say let's stand together do you know what potentially a study potential or potentially cause potential will carry your potential as a point if you just look in the word potential it's gonna carry you to a point like your way over here and and you ain't over there potentially is you've already got it started but you need to go more and lower into what you got so everybody understand potentially what I'm done by you got ourselves to start with are you gonna have something in the end so potentially when you got the Holy Ghost you got all you needed better on sale he said when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got all you needed well bless God I don't have to go to church I don't have to do nothing I just sit at home and help me a good time cuz he told me I had everything why don't you hear people quoting stuff like that what do we got 217 anybody have a need you have a need when you play if the potential industry say what your Dalma the day you truly believe don't lose that don't give up [Music] it is loosely in God Barney's run [Music] why this hanging them to him is you leave remember the service now
