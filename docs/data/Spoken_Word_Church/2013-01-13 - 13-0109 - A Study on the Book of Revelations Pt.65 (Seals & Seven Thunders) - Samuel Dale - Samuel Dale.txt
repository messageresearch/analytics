them the Lord would bless them and take care of them because but I know like Nanny's and all of them going through this constant that just gets you all warn out and then they don't have no energy so just remember to pray for them in Brother house uh brother there that's dying with cancer so remember that all right let's pray father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we Praise Your Great Name we know that by your doings Lord that we can follow after you and be able to understand you because of the ways you take and the way you lead us and guide us the main thing we do tonight Lord is to remember those that are sick some are watching now Lord they're trying to video and be in with us with the services then you just bless them there as they're con you know connecting in and then bless all that's on the internet system and and bless Lord Your Love in Your Grace unto us forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 then we'll go to Revelations 8 says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who be record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right let's go over to Revelation 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now what I want to do is review some back on Sundays cuz I want you to to understand what I'm trying to drive it and that way we can move on then into other things in the Book of Revelations but now what have we found we found that to according to mankind according to if anybody else wants a copy of the notes there one lay up here if you want to get it some of you can't see and and everything so if you want one you know we don't give Brother Ray and sister uh back there one but now according to the world and according to the basis of the people of the message that we're claiming to be following and and everything they're scared of the Book of Revelations right and they don't want to speak about it or anything like that because they're afraid of being you know maybe something uh them go out and go out on the limb and you know but I've always figured one thing there's no need no difference between being out on the limb and out in midair you know right because if we're not right we're one of them too and both of them is in bad shape you so that's a you know I just never had to worry about that so I just go on and at least tell you what I believe and then by telling you what I believe then you can you know you can AR argue the point or whatever you want to about it but we read that there was silence in heaven now I went through a lot of that Sunday that there's silence in heaven and we're quick to say well there's nothing written there you know well we found out that according to the prophet there was a lot of things that we need to cover there because of what he said it was right so we went through those things trying to to bring forth the understanding that by way of a prophet to me there's no difference in the seventh seal when it says there silence in heaven than it is the first seal when it says there's a white horse rider wrote out because we didn't know what that was that's right until the prophet came to tell us all right then we'll get back to it in a minute and he gets down and he said I want to tell you my revelation of it well that was what he was doing on the 1 2 third fourth fifth 6th you know it was his revelation of it so we're dependent upon his revelation of the word of God all right and in doing that we can look at it and see that there's a lot of things taking place we read our Sunday that and I'm just scan over these won't try to put them up on the screen but just scan over a little bit we found out brother ROM says that there's a the eth chapter only reveals the scene of the seven but seal where nothing else is revealed amen but now he says it's a scene all right now he's made it something already right y it's a scene now whatever that scene is is you know that's between the Lord and you is talking about it but then we found that the seventh seal that he would say was perfectly mute in that quote 777 then he says it spoke of in the very beginning in Genesis the S sealed it well that puts it in the Bible that puts it into the Bible oh yeah because if it's spoke of it's in the Bible that that that ought to be sensible to us all right and we know that he said that we came down into the message talking about it and he said paragraph 394 the seven seal he said you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows but right along with what he said no one would know his coming so we went through that to show that the seventh seal the prophet said is the coming of the Lord amen amen all right now if it's the coming of the Lord then it's something right it's not just a gap of 30 minutes you know a place that's put there nothing in it you know there's a scene there and he says that those angels cherubims Etc and all standing all right when that seven seal is open so they see it what I'm trying to get you to look at is and try there Sunday that that you can say well we just don't know this we don't know that well if I can read what he says all right that's the only hopes I got anyway because what you got to say and what I've got to say don't Mount to Hell beans I mean we ought to be old enough long enough in the way to realize that but what he says so then he said it went right on end to the point of saying that it was those seven Thunders paragraph 394 there he said it's connected together all right the coming of the Lord he said is connected together with the Thunders right all right and he said we understand that much and said the rest of it will be unfolded you know rest of it is all unfolded but this is not unfolded there's parts of that not unfolded you know right CU When he spoke of that he spoke of a fold of it all right he said it was in a threefold manner paragraph 245 he said by God's help I speak to you a full of it that it's those seven Thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden right right right now my emphasis throughout the message tonight will be one thing trying to tie together the entire Bible and looking at the seven Thunders now wait in a few minutes do we get down to a point that I want to bring out on that okay we covered that he said it like paragraph 229 that the seventh seal is the end of all things L if it's the end of all things it's something so you say end is like you know you walk out to a cliff and fall off well just remember there is a bottom down there somewhere all right but did you go home and look up the word end or did you even go home and look up the word come I don't know what it means I told Brother didck come to my house well that's good but the coming is not any form of travel that's why the prophet said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here it's not a travel form if I ask you to come to my house I don't sit there at the house call you where you at where you at where you at where you at now you know if you're late or something we understand but I mean I'm not calling you every second to see where you at cuz I'm not responsible for that part right but the word come is actually look it up it literally means to be more closer than a husband and a wife who when a man comes home from work or something and they're in each other's arms and see we're we're English people and the prophet was speaking English why can't we use English words right to comprehend what he was trying to say amen and you look up the word in we say end is you know that just mean that's as far as you can go well now that's not true in in all forms the end of the and I never have understood the centuries I can't getra the end of the 20th century it didn't end the world is it what was the end of the 20th century the beginning of the 21st century is that sensible see the end the first seal was what when the second seal broke that's right right see it's like a star step the prophet said climbing upward right see then we look at the word end and we think well it's just well it's just the end of something but he's trying to express to us that it's the end of all things amen he said it even ends the Usher end of the Millennium well when you get to the end of the Usher end of the Millennium you walk into the Millennium you say say the seventh seal is here I got to remember I still here brother I Lor myself see I'm just trying to get us to go with this simple words everybody said Brother D was so deep but that's first grade reading right Abby can tell you what the word come means now she she'll say that that see oh she can sound it out you know and you know a three-year-old can know what to word means it can't even sound it you say to to little uh one of ry's kids back there come here I don't know what he mean no no no they they come to you see it's not meaning way it's meaning come here break the message down simple brother said go on with simple message is that what he said in the seventh seal he said because if you don't you'll work yourself away from it keeping it simple all right and seeing that the coming of the Lord so I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ started on the day of Pentecost amen that's right his first coming started in Genesis you know really before the foundation world coming down you com on down okay he spoke more of his second coming than he did of his first coming right and I thought that was one of the questions that was asked in Matthew 24 we let be there won't be one stone left on another right and what is the sign of thy coming right and of the end of the world well we found the seven the six seal is to be the end of the world that's what your Prophet said it is what's the sign of his coming the sign of his coming is an announcement right we're going to get down to some scriptures one of these days and I get time too and try to tie together where it says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the out I thought we believe that was the message amen well then God has already descended right so you're looking for his coming he's already here right but it outside of the Corporal body you know what he means what's the difference we listening yesterday to him where was bringing out and showing how that there's more Revelation here today than there was in creation right amen that's right more of God is being revealed today than it was in creation amen see why can't we believe that sure he said it's a complete mystery he gets on over to the seventh seal 399 paragraph he says see it's a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for these Mysteries to be known now listen to it therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that Jesus appears on Earth again for his bride right yes or whatever takes place at that time now whatever you think that is 10 Visions whatever you know around coming back or whatever you still got to realize that something's going to happen right right here in the end time all right I told wait I said you better be ready cuz I'm might wind up with the you know the problems are running that the whole family's got and I said cut it off hold it right there you answer the question I'll give you know I may have trouble just preaching you know trying to talk to you but he said amen and whatever takes place at that time right when Jesus appears on Earth again for his bride amen well as I said I thought we believed that the Lord descended from heaven with a shout and that that was a message to get the people ready amen that's right right that's I thought that's what we believe see but now look we talked about the coming of the Lord that even Jesus didn't know him when he was coming right he says that there in the scripture I think it's Mark 13 what is it 32 where he says it that even the son don't know and brother Brown uses it on the souls in prison paragraph 136 he said it's always a mystery that's the Finish because Jesus said himself not even an angel of heaven knows when I will return I don't even know it myself what time the father has put that in his mind God Alone knows it the coming of the Lord he goes over to paragraph 208 of the souls in prison he says the lamb took the book and when the seventh seal just ready for it to be opened the Sixth Seal remember he hid the seventh seal from us he wouldn't do it when the Angels stood day by day telling but then he wouldn't do it on that one said there is silence in heaven no one knew it was the coming of the Lord right but if you believe the Lord started his coming at Calvary M what's the problem of understanding the coming of the Lord right you say well it's the secret that's right where is there a church that teaches the coming of the Lord is your new birth where you started at where is it even in this message come on come on that they teach it like that no one day it's going to Sky going to split oh we going to see bless him he's going to come down sweep down talking with some brothers that here one time and this brother he said I I I just can't understand said I always believe that that when Jesus would come yeah that he would I got some in my pocket thank you brother that when Jesus would come that we'd come riding on horses fighting a battle boy that's something man we going to come back over and glorified bodies ride with a glorified Lord Jesus on white horses and we going to come down here and punch people in the nose or shoot them with a gun now that's about carnal when they couldn't shoot us if they had guns right right right come we' be an eternal glorified body amen but see that's what people are taught that's the things they believe they don't consider the truth of the whole matter brother said on Feast of the trumpets paragraph 147 he said because on the seventh seal there was silence no one knew that was the minute or hour that Christ would come as he revealed it to us amen I'm quoting him the minute or hour of his coming but see we're looking for kind of a something that makes a great uh big hoopla what the word would be there far well we coming back we just going to fight you know we're going to do this we're going to do that and I I I just don't see it that way I'm sorry I don't want to bust your bubble but that's just the way I believe it I preach here to my church what I believe amen amen see this is not for anybody else unless you want to listen to it but now listen brother randam goes into it and he says but when the seven Thunders and when the seven angels come forth to sound their trumpet there was one Thunder one Thunder but here is seven straight Thunders right in a row paragraph 249 of the seal book he said it's a relaxing time y right amen now when the seal broke they stood in all mhm now all is not a ra a relaxing time right that means you're te H you're standing at attention everything is perfectly and you brothers that was in the military you know you stood there at attention right amen and what was it you didn't dare lock your knees backward or something because you'd fall out in a little bit you know so everything was tension what about I while they said at ease will you just stand there no you tickle to death when they said at ease right cuz everything just slum you said it's a relaxing time yes see somebody one of these days going to see what it is amen and it's going to be a relaxing it's going to be a wonderful time that's right yep to rejoice and understand all about what's been going on here amen but he said it was he said it was the end of all things he said it was a scene he said it was the coming of the Lord and he says and those seven Thunders said they're all connected together now what I want to do for a little bit I want you to think about something let's just turn to Revelations 5 cuz I've heard this scripture explained over and over and over I'm sure you have too and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals now heard that red but according to English sorry I don't have any you know that but I got a little sense this is where a lot of people read it and it's saw in the right hand to him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals he well that's what it says why is that little comma after back slide the backside I thought a little compliment you just kind of slow down pause for a second it's not a period for you to stop it it it means just slow down right relax a little just slow down so now you read it to where it's written then and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside now you get sealed with Seven Seals you said what's the difference in that and read it the other way look what it's saying it says they're writing inside of this book and it's writing on the back side of this book but whatever is there inside outside upside down backwards whatever it winds up saying it's sealed with Seven Seals now brother in many occasions refers to this and he says see this writing in the book is writing the back side the book do you need those quotes I mean I'm be glad to find them for you but never did he say that there was anything on the outside the book they would add to what was in the book I want to quote that's right amen I I want that quote right that he ever made reference to an addition to the book that would be on the backside he says on the the first seal page 45 paragraph 45 he said if it was this kind of a book which means you know like we got he said it would be like seven straps on the outside right you know but he said it's not that kind of a book said it's a scroll and see being a scroll then you have many Scrolls you have many things to do but the way you know where you're at is there's a little tab sticking out a little something there that would say Isaiah then you roll it in Jeremiah Ezekiel more or less a statement of what book is is right so it's not adding to the book if Isaiah is written on the back side right if it's a scroll there well Isaiah sticking out it's not adding it's just an explanation of where the book what book it is amen because because you can't add to the book amen amen the Bible says if you add to this book you'll add the plagues of the book right but he said if you take away from this book you'll take your name out of the book that's scripture right you see we look at it is trying to figure out what is outside the book we'll get down in a minute where the Prophet said even the Thunders was not outside the book amen that's when I tried to get over Sunday there you can't add to the book right but when the book is revealed then you can see what the book really is about you can draw up your definition or think about it but why don't you listen a little bit and see if you're checking everything everything El you can't be listening I mean ain't nobody in here can do that I forgive me ain't nobody in here smart enough to figure out anything in the book and hear what the person say now you say you are I'm telling you you're a dummy cuz it can't be done that's as plain as I can make it I asked one time here I even said I said I wish you'd shut your books up your Bibles lay them on the seat and listen and a brother got some mad at me he come to me he said ain't nobody don't tell me I can't keep my book open well he was the one I was talking about I was simply trying to tell him listen because he was getting confused about what I was saying so read it so here we are in chapter 5 with a book that's closed right sealed up right right right then you turn over to chapter 6 and going into chapter 8 and you find that the lamb was breaking the seals right right right but I remember what we were trying to bring out Sunday your Prophet said it and I gave them Sunday if you want to go back on anybody on the Internet run it backwards I can take up in a minute I'll give it brother Ren says we're only presuming until that seventh seal breaks amen I don't understand that right ain't none of my business what you understand it's just plain language that's what he said he said you're only presuming until that seventh seal breaks you're going to find out when we get down to the end of this that the seventh seal was what was to be broken this day it was sealed by seven Thunders right CU that's where he said the seven the Thunders were that in the seven seal all right now chapter five the book is closed we gave it to before it's on Revelation chapter 5 book two I guess you call preach 1961 uh 618 he said this chapter 5 is not a verse by verse description of something it's preparing for something to happen right chapter 5 is preparing for something to happen right now you better remember this chapter 5 is not you in heaven until you get there you can think all you want you think well I thought I thought that's what you taught No Way chapter 5 is not a reality until we get there then it's a reality you said yeah but we're taking up chapter 4 good but you better jump back down in chapter 10 somewhere cuz you going to need that seventh angel but think about what I'm saying all right because in chapter 5 the book is closed chapter one seal number one open I mean chapter 61 seal number one opens you go down a couple of verses seal number two opens seal number three opens seal number four five six even up to Revelations 81 where it says when the lamb broke the seal they were silence in heaven all right now you know that's in the book right MH now are you getting why it says in Revelations 5 come on are you listening Revelation 6 7 8 9 10 what there's no way to know what that is until that angel tells us but all that's written in the book remember chapter 5 we read book written within right and on the back side right sealed with Seven Seals all right here's the statements everybody make but do you understand it Revelations 5 the book is closed Revelation 10 the book is open so now with that thought in mind let's go to chapter 10 remember what I said there's writing in the book you're not adding to when it says that that the seven Thunders sounded their voices that's written in the book we just don't know what it said it's written in the book you can't add to the book amen said no one shall be a be not not one word shall be added or taken from how can you take from and add to that then it shows you what Veil you got your veiled that's got you veiled away brother R says now that was quoting from the unveiling of God paragraph 238 this is paragraph 2 218 216 and the world falling the falling apart of the world 621 12:16 he said his word it's Eternal it can't be added to or taken away right do you understand why he said that if it's not eternal it could be added to or taken away but if it's Eternal he can't add to all right that order to solve the problem now let's read Revelations 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven CL over the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet is sters of fire now listen and he had in his hand a little book open all right everybody says Revelation 5 is closed Revelation 10 is open okay that's exactly right right but see you don't read the rest of the book verse three and he cried with with a loud voices when a lion roared and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not now as I tried to explain Sunday according to my understanding or Roberts University has brother this message all right if they don't somebody else has it so what do you argue with me over who that I'm talking about still listening to what's being said a lot of people's got R around his message right amen and they can read it right and they can take the first seal and make you a wonderful speech about that it is not the White Horse riter is not the Holy Ghost it's the Antichrist because they've got what brother around said okay right so the book is open Revelation 102 said it's open well what's the problem if it's open there wouldn't be any problem if he didn't have three and four down below there you have an open book but when you go down to the fourth verse and it says seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so is the Bible sealed with Seven Seals once the prophet has told us what they are are you listening once he told you what that is is it sealed I'm asking you that question see it's an open book give anybody a see book and let them read it right it don't matter where the Methodist mad Presbyterian or Catholics or whatever we was up at Jeffersonville years ago brother Billy Paul come out here and told us he said he' just gotten a letter from the World Council of churches I think it was or the Catholic Church one of the two now I may missed it that's a long time ago but they ordered or requested a church age book this is probably about 68 69 somewhere in there why would they request a book When anybody could just walk up and give them one see I walk up to you and I give you a book I give you a book you can't use that in the court you can't use that in ACC cour to law cuz anybody can write a book but when you request that I send you a certain book it can be used in court you better think about it the church AE book is is drastically against organized religion and Catholic church and things right amen but you see church are you listening the book is open in chapter 10 but why would it turn right back around and say the seven Thunders when they uttered their voices he was told not to R it let me just read a couple of things brother around says about this God in Simplicity paragraph 380 talking about the breaking of the seals one will take place if the angel of the Lord will break them seals for us remember it's seal with them seven mysterious Thunders now you got 14 seals come on girl you got the book seal with Seven Seals but yet you don't know what those things are until the thunder sound to you right even though you can read verbatim off the page you can read the Bible verbatim and we taught of Trinity right right but that's scripture for it but he said it seal with them seven Thunders paragraph 29 of the breach between the church a and the seals this seven seal book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelations 10 I hope you're following me you can read the church the seal book over and over and over and don't know what in the world it's saying yeah you know what's said on each line each page each word yes amen what about a revelation that's right paragraph 103 of God hidden in Simplicity you talking about being inspired and and I believe that the seven angels who holds those seven Thunders will grant 78 questions and answers book 4 64 8:30 evening service question 395 have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the seven Thunders yet he says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about there was to reveal the seven Thunders that heard of voices and no one can make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it but he said the seventh angel in the day of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed amen huh so we had right to say this is my revelation of it amen this is my Revelation right all right you remember the other day when I was trying to bring out a little bit on it there in the scriptures Jesus said glorify me with the glory thy heav the before the word begun and God sounded back and said I have glorified you and will glorify you again and they that stood by heard it thunder right but Jesus knew what was saying right right Mount Si brother around and said God thundered but the people heard bloom bloom bloom bloom bloom but Moses Heard a Voice mhm brother Ram what are those Thunders he said the Thunder is the voice of God he said have you heard the Thunders The Voice have you heard the voice of God through the opening of these seals what are you trying to explain the book is sealed in chapter 5 but it's excuse me but it's open in chapter 10 we know how it came open the lamb opened the seals right right but then immediately it sealed right back up right because the seven Thunders uted their voices I'll be glad to find these for you and my angels didn't tell John didn't tell brother random anything out there in Arizona other than come back to Jefferson bille now that's what he said go back to Jeffersonville be told you what to do you better be careful because you make him a liar if you think he knows everything when he came back because when he got back he said I don't know what that first seal is that's then when the first seal was broke he said I don't know what the second one is right now I'd rather had his idea than mine or yours you right but he said he didn't know he said I'd have made a horrible mistake on that first seal if he had to come in the room to straighten me out he said it's been the a has not been a man said it's been I'm talk quoting out of seable it's been the angels of the Lord bringing me back for this message tonight he said that's on the seventh seal see why he would say you're only presuming until the seventh seal breaks but yet he knew all week long something was going on he asked the question or made the statement he said I wondered if somebody catch it and see what was going on that's what we're going to do on the next message the Lord willing is take the things brother brandham said that seventh seal was to him amen CU he said this is my Revelation see thunder is a voice of God when no seals broke to the prophet he had heard the voice of God y amen amen God had spoke to him and told him what it was right he said an angel come daily in the room right y he says the Holy Spirit was in the room to reveal those things what is the Angel of the Lord what is an angel come in yeah and then everybody went in the seventh angel was brother randam theop yeah and that's who he saw well you got a problem back there with Paul might stand a pretty good thought but when you get over about Luther Wesley you you're running very close to saying that there was a theophany there to tell them what that Feld 6 and 7 C was when Luther himself said that the Jews was Antichrist nor been took out and killed I wouldn't want his the offy coming to me but you understand what I'm getting at just a point I want you to get because this is a basics for foundation for another couple of messages so in Revelations 5 the book is is closed but we read that it's open and how it's opened by the lamb and I read to you the other day where that John was to send back to the church right but he said he brought it and signified it to John he said in John remember the quote handed it down right to the seventh angel you know it's over in the 10th chapter where John later is told you go take the book you got your 10 chapter look at the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth yes and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall come it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey yes and I took a little book out of the hand of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my daily was bitter you know what brother R said about it he said the word is sweet sometimes when you hear it he said but it's better when you got to live it okay and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings so John is told he's coming back to the Earth he's at to book have we ate the book come on right have we ate the book if John was the type of the Rapture I thought he would be a type of all the things you know would be related to you and I amen so if John was to eat the book what about you and I right is this word that we have more valuable than life itself right that's right or are we concerned about what somebody else says I like to read what people have to say but it never enters my Cranium cap as you call it my head as to think that they are they're right they might be partially right right they might have a little truth but you remember about a year ago I tried to Pi the message on it I want the truth not a truth but the truth we can read the book anybody can read this Bible that's right Y and if you read this Bible under the explanation now are you listening if you read this Bible under the explanation of the Prophet you would never see a Trinity right and you could be able to explain one God that's right Father Son and Holy Ghost that's like I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human but has it been revealed right in other words have you ate the book where it can be revealed or you ate a bunch of other stuff got a belly a and don't want the book right well you just think you're the only one that knows anything that's funny I've never said that right and you know what people accuse you of being what they are ever noticed that that's a quote from Brother Woody way back years ago that people accuse you of being what they are you ever seen two people fussing fighting both of them fuss and fighting over about the same thing both of them talking about the same thing one accusing the other one to be in this accusing the other be in that but it's the book open if if you understand what I'm saying Church come on this book is opened that's right sir the Prophet come and go told us what these things mean that's why I have written in my Bible what it means right because I don't have that good a memory anymore and I'm glad years ago I wrote it down the prophet say something I said what does that mean okay hey we got that man I can tell you what the prophet said but I can do every bit of that if you're listening to what I'm saying and not have one Dil of Revelation that's right and have not heard the voice of God cuz the Thunder is the voice of God the Thunder is the voice of God but see if he thundered at Mount Si and Moses knew what he said but yet Moses wrote down that it thundered he never wrote down what he said right you know he may how do you understand what I'm just driving the point mhm the world when Jesus was standing there heard a thunder but he heard a voice and evidently Every Which the writer Mark Matthew Mark Luke John one of which two of them wasn't there so you have to take that out Mark and Luke so evident of John are some of them you know must have remembered what was said right and they wrote it down they heard what was said but everybody else heard a thunder have you heard the voice of God brother around would say speaking to you from the opening of these seals sir come on that that that's the only thing that I want to know anything about not how long you've been in the message much your seniority is that's right know right yeah I want to know the truth that's right I don't want to be like that brother one time said I shouted over the Trinity and I shout now well I wouldn't have made that statement for nothing in the world because he was saying I just shout it he had no reference to anything that would be of any value he just shouted over the Trinity he shouted over the truth right but you see we think those things are beautiful things but has the Thunder the voice of God sounded to you through the opening of God's word no no no brother that I'm never heard of Thunder well if the prophet's right you notice I'm saying that out that way not me right if the prophet is right then he was the mouthpiece of God so whatever he said is what's right right yes sir not what we think he said right but what he said that's right y but you see we spend our time trying to explain something and I know I've done that over and over right but I've tried my best to explain it where you can understand it if the Thunder is the voice of God have you heard the voice of God through the opening of the word right because you cannot claim then the where it says the Lord himself to descend from heaven and a shout so you can't BL that if you haven't heard the message right that sensible you know somebody come in somebody walk right off the street come in I want to be saved you telling the Lord to sended with a shout where did he go where's he at right cuz they don't know what you're talking about right but when it's made known then you can see we don't need another messenger that's right we need this message revealed I'm going to say this and I'll come back to it in a couple weeks maybe next Wednesday whatever so if the coming of the Lord is what the prophet said it was he said it was the revealing of the word that's right that's it so anything if he's come to you and I the words got to be revealed that's right cuz that's the only way he can come we're not talking about his first coming that brought salvation healings and things we're talking about his second coming and remember what I brought out Sunday why the S seal is silence minute hour of his coming right you can't tell the world about it that's right that's right there's no way to tell them that's right because it's his coming that's right amen and his coming is when he revealed the word to you not to me right revealing it to me is f where I can break it down and talk to you about it but he's got to reveal hisself to you you wasn't saved because you come to Lula amen right amen you're saved by grace through faith through your dependence upon the blood of Jesus Christ oh yeah right well then the change of the body could only be one thing the coming of the Lord and wasn't that what the prophet said he comes back after us I met a quote her the other day you might to hang on to it you come back after us right that's what the S seal doing is com back after you it's not coming to reveal you a Redemptive form it's coming to claim his possession that's right think on these things there's a lot of things under the seventh seal that the prophet has told us now we get into next we get into the things that the prophet told him that was related to him and then let's see if we can find it related to me and you that's it right cuz if we don't find it related to you and I it's not going to work it's not going to change us right what do you think about it that a person could tell you what the seventh seal is you know the prophet tell you what it is amen he said this is my revelation of it right yet he made it so simple he was talking about the things that was taking place in his own life that's right I wish you would go to the seal seven seal and listen to it you'll understand why in the beginning when I first read it that I quit reading it went back to the church age book because I saw him talking too much about his right that's the way I thought it but then one day I seen he was talking about you and me that's right then I could go back and read the book and listen to what he had to say and find out his coming has been coming since the day of Pentecost we we are the end of his coming is that the seventh seal the end of all things we're ending it there right but when he comes here is that the end of everything no the world knows nothing about it time will go right on it won't end the world it won't end anything for him to come and get you and me tonight they'll just keep right on going that's right but see it be the end for you and I cuz the end of any thing is a new beginning amen you're not talking about natural things falling off a cliff you're talking about the revealing of his word that's right one more statement that's why I believe in forming latter rign see because what we have today and God even reveal it to us tomorrow will be a former reain that's right because there's a new word every day amen yeah right opening of the word every day than you Lord so what I stand with tonight is wonderful but tomorrow I must keep searching praying and saying Lord reveal this to me let me go out as the children of Israel did and get me another fresh part of Mana but just don't put me in a place where I'm going to try to hold it over you remember rotten what do you think about it the book is open the prophet said it sealed those seven Thunders until we know what those Thunders are we're only presuming yet we can read off the pages what it is amen but I still don't make it was real have you ever asked God for a revelation amen yes I mean just ask him to reveal something yes sir I don't understand what brother Dale talking about I can't figure him out well ask God to reveal it right and then when he reveals there won't be no problem could it be your Revelation see then you can say this is my Revelation right I don't turn over in Genesis 1 or somewhere in there and see the serpent Seek about you know third chapter whatever it is and say brother said that's fine but see that's been revealed to me thank you Lord I know what happened there thank you Lord that's been revealed then I can keep reading it and find myself in the book come on Brothers find ourselves he said John found his name in the book have you found your name that's is H you a brown out don't like them words run around said it and I believe it amen now
