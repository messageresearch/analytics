[9:41] Galatians the 4th chapter and verse
[9:44] 19 and also
[9:46] Colossians the 1 chapter and verse 27
[9:50] but this is one those statement I'm
[9:52] going to use right here Paul just
[9:54] says my little my little childrens of
[9:58] whom I
[10:00] whom I Prevail in birth again until
[10:04] Christ be
[10:06] what in you uh Galatians I mean
[10:10] Galatians
[10:12] 1:27 he said to to whom God will make
[10:18] known what is the richest of the glory
[10:21] of this this mystery among the gentille
[10:25] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[10:30] let's pray hallelujah oh Father help me
[10:34] one more time to yield my body my
[10:37] mind my spirit my soul to you oh God oh
[10:41] God help me to get myself out of the way
[10:43] Lord and use it for your glory this
[10:46] evening father now father I give you all
[10:48] my strength in Jesus Christ's name we
[10:50] pray amen God bless you you may be
[10:53] seated one
[10:54] moment you nothing else do with the this
[10:57] this them scriptures Al long or to them
[11:00] scriptures alone have got enough uh
[11:02] anointing and enough Revelation to
[11:04] almost uh to interpretate it what God
[11:08] purpose is for the bride Hallelujah in
[11:10] other words I I I I want to use for a
[11:12] title this evening for a start the bride
[11:15] is called to be formed into a word body
[11:19] hallu that's that's the you know we
[11:21] preach the revelation of the Seven Seals
[11:23] and and the revelation of the Thunders
[11:26] and and the revelation of of of the
[11:28] chain you know the NS and everything but
[11:31] really when we look at the all the whole
[11:33] picture of it that God had a purpose for
[11:36] this Revelation and what you know you
[11:38] know a lot of time we take Revelation
[11:40] well I got an understanding we realize
[11:42] Revelation is a Divine understanding not
[11:45] just a understanding because many can
[11:48] understand all the the Mysteries and
[11:50] them and not even be born again but real
[11:53] Revelation is got a purpose with it
[11:55] Hallelujah in other words so Paul say I
[11:58] lay him prevail that mean I'm
[12:00] experiencing pain a birth pain for you
[12:03] until Christ be formed in you and so
[12:06] Paul knew that we was coming to an edge
[12:09] that Christ was going to be manifested
[12:11] in his fullness and a body called The
[12:13] Church of the Bride H we begin to look
[12:16] here so we realize here so you know we
[12:19] we we we are just looking at these
[12:21] things here a word body is what we try
[12:23] to get back to because if you think
[12:25] about it what is our purpose for for
[12:27] even coming to hear the message message
[12:30] we're not just coming to hear the
[12:31] message just to say well I'm a good
[12:33] person I've been good I done this but we
[12:36] are coming to hear the message and hear
[12:38] the word of God because we are trying to
[12:40] get our body back to where it fell from
[12:43] hallelujah our body hey people now if
[12:46] you if you satisfi with this body you
[12:47] God that's up to
[12:49] you but I'm tell I tell you what this
[12:51] thing right here getting no trouble me
[12:54] and the older it get the worse it get
[12:56] Hall you know it it's nothing fun about
[12:58] getting
[12:59] right how that way you know you know we
[13:01] try to we try to in world so we realize
[13:04] here we realize here so God had a
[13:06] purpose and God purpose is that God that
[13:09] that man that God can dwell in man and a
[13:13] flesh body and we have eternal life
[13:16] absolutely you know when we find it I
[13:18] was just using this I said you know if
[13:21] we look at the revelation of it God in
[13:23] in genes 127 said God created man in his
[13:26] own image so when God put man in the IM
[13:28] image of in his invisible image of Adam
[13:31] in other words in this image that Adam
[13:33] was first created in when God created it
[13:35] could not be a fall in that that body to
[13:38] Adam first that body right there the
[13:41] devil couldn't come to that body in
[13:42] tempure right Hallelujah if Adam would
[13:45] have stayed in that body Hallelujah it
[13:47] would never been a fall so then the
[13:50] Bible says here in in Genesis 2 verse S
[13:53] then God formed
[13:55] man Hallelujah word he took he took from
[13:59] the the the attribute of the Earth how
[14:02] the Propet the Earth was an eternal
[14:05] attribute and he and word if Adam would
[14:08] have never fell he would he if he would
[14:10] have never fell in that body he would
[14:12] have been a Eternal attribute living his
[14:16] skin so God aded here so God took the
[14:19] Earth and he formed man and Man became a
[14:24] living
[14:25] Soul you notice this it was a living
[14:28] soul right in other words in other words
[14:31] Adam had God to breathe in him a eternal
[14:35] spirit Adam himself had eternal life H
[14:39] the Adam himself did not have uh Adam
[14:42] himself did not have blood right you
[14:45] said brother you said why he didn't have
[14:47] blood because what did he need blood for
[14:49] hu he was an eternal spirit but when
[14:52] Adam fell and man fell and then what did
[14:55] man do he begin to he death set in and
[14:58] when death s in into the body of man man
[15:02] as he ate the food of the earth that was
[15:04] in the curse man had blood H and the
[15:07] only thing that's polluted in US is our
[15:10] blood scream on H the Bible say there's
[15:13] no flesh and blood will in Hur the
[15:15] kingdom of heaven so what did Jesus do
[15:18] and when Jesus died on the day of
[15:21] redemption he it was a blood sacrifice
[15:23] and it had to be blood because man fell
[15:26] and he need something to cover his sin
[15:30] so it had to be blood H the blood
[15:34] screen in other words so we realize here
[15:37] now we would have read up doing that
[15:38] because I want you to no Adam that body
[15:41] that he had after Adam fell no longer
[15:44] can Adam pass through a
[15:46] tree before Adam fell he can walk right
[15:49] through the
[15:50] object H another and still have have a
[15:53] body with flesh on it h where that body
[15:56] had no limitations on it I B got
[15:58] limitations on it how in other words so
[16:01] this whole me the whole revelation of
[16:03] this word is to bring us back to that
[16:06] same body that Adam had the Bible say
[16:09] about one man sin we all fell until this
[16:13] corruption right here but by Man by one
[16:15] man
[16:16] righteousness we would all be restored
[16:19] back to what we fell from the whole
[16:21] message itself is bringing us back to
[16:23] restored Eden H so I begin to look
[16:26] here let me look at this simp a minute I
[16:29] begin to think on these things and I
[16:30] begin to think why you know you say
[16:32] brother Jew like brother like like
[16:34] brother way used today it was really I
[16:37] really enjoy the way he brought it up if
[16:39] without
[16:40] faith without a divine revelation
[16:44] there's nobody change for you that's
[16:46] right because the Rapture is based on a
[16:49] revelation right of Jesus Christ in you
[16:52] the hope of glory hu outside of that the
[16:55] body don't change you do not change CH
[16:58] the body by being a good person you
[17:01] changed by Revelation and if you notice
[17:04] here I was going to use this quote the
[17:06] scripture when he talk to Peter he say
[17:08] to Peter he asked him who the man said
[17:10] that I am and they begin to say well
[17:13] some said uhh you are Elijah some say
[17:16] you are one of the Prophet Jesus say
[17:17] it's not good enough it's not in of the
[17:20] word is what some man say it was
[17:23] somebody else had an opinion of me but
[17:25] who do you say that I am H it was by
[17:28] Revelation Peter said th the Christ the
[17:31] son of the Living God that Revelation
[17:34] alone was strong enough come on to get
[17:37] Peter the keys to his own house
[17:39] Hallelujah he gave Peter the keys to his
[17:41] own house by divine revelation
[17:43] Hallelujah he said Peter he said the
[17:45] Gates of Hell will come against you but
[17:48] the Gates of Hell shall not under any
[17:51] circumstance be able to overcome this
[17:54] Revelation right here H we got a
[17:56] revelation of got the devil answer I
[17:58] begin to look here so we begin to think
[18:00] on them things I begin to think so he
[18:02] telling Peter this and this the
[18:04] Revelation alone is what going to change
[18:06] our bodies we going to have a body
[18:08] change because in the word everything
[18:11] you know if you notice he used that
[18:13] pyramid this morning it start with faith
[18:15] and I realize outside of having faith
[18:18] those virtues could never be scre no way
[18:21] H so it take Faith to believe it right H
[18:24] and then and what is it doing what is
[18:26] the statute of the perfect man is Christ
[18:29] been formed in you the hope of glory
[18:32] that's the whole Revelation H the
[18:34] statute of a perfect man and when Christ
[18:37] himself is standing behind skin again H
[18:41] that's the revelation God trying to get
[18:42] us back to
[18:44] Hallelujah praise God I just we just
[18:47] stinking on everything thing so and when
[18:49] man Fa l get back here he word see
[18:51] brother he he us we we would we to have
[18:54] we to have eternal life Adam had eternal
[18:57] life
[18:59] he had eternal life until Adam walked
[19:03] down behind the word of God and when
[19:05] Adam walked out behind the word of God
[19:08] he walked into
[19:09] time if you notice this when Adam fell
[19:13] what did he do he moved from eternity
[19:15] into time Hallelujah in other words he
[19:18] stepped out of he walked from eternity
[19:21] and walked into time because the Bible
[19:24] say in the day that you eat the that day
[19:28] you should surely die Adam was not
[19:30] associated with days come on he he was
[19:33] just Eternal Soul he had eternal life
[19:36] but when when Adam when Adam walked out
[19:38] from behind the word of God what did he
[19:40] have he fell into death he fell in time
[19:44] H now Adam going to eat the bread he got
[19:46] to wait until he returned back to dust
[19:50] where he come from from Adam from out of
[19:53] dust will th taken and dust shall I
[19:56] return so what did he do in other word
[19:58] it put him in a a lock of
[20:02] time until means a due time or decree
[20:05] season so Adam had a time that he was
[20:08] going to die because the day he entered
[20:11] her that day when no man live a thousand
[20:15] years on earth right Adam fored his
[20:18] right to actually go back at that time
[20:21] to have eternal life in the body and
[20:23] live he did not even live one day
[20:25] because the day with the Lord was a th
[20:27] years and the as of that year he did not
[20:29] make it a day methus Liv 969 years he
[20:33] did not make it a day but this bride
[20:36] she's going back she's picking up the
[20:39] old seven she go back into millania we
[20:42] live a thousand years on Earth how the
[20:44] fulfilling because God word cannot be
[20:48] broken how begin to look here so we
[20:51] realize here what it is so we what is
[20:53] the whole Revelation the seven SE the
[20:55] seven SE is coming is the the Seven
[20:58] Seals coming to the bride is to give us
[21:01] a revelation right right of the changing
[21:03] of the body amen so it can take us out
[21:06] of time and put us back in eternity that
[21:08] why he say the seven seal which is
[21:11] Christ himself coming back to what earth
[21:14] right the Revelation was thy will be
[21:16] done in earth as it is in heaven
[21:19] hallelujah how will we know what this
[21:21] will is and remember when Jesus said
[21:23] don't Rejoice because the devil's
[21:25] accepted unto you but Rejoice because
[21:27] your name is WR in heaven H those guys
[21:30] could not interpret it they might have
[21:31] said one they probably wonder but that's
[21:34] a time that the Revelation is here now
[21:36] that the bride know where she come from
[21:39] H it's the to bring her from time back
[21:42] into eternity we are going back to where
[21:45] we come from hallu the devil know he
[21:48] can't defeat the bride so we begin to go
[21:50] here look
[21:51] here read a quotation from what the
[21:54] prophet said in the mess of invisible
[21:56] Union in other words
[21:59] he goes to use this right here I want
[22:01] you to notice this God do not destroy
[22:05] himself he said if God destroy himself
[22:09] how can he remain God the soul that SED
[22:13] that Soul should surely die he said God
[22:15] destroyed himself how can he remain God
[22:19] H but if you was with God the devil
[22:22] can't and word now let me just use this
[22:25] right here let just show you how BR put
[22:27] it in in Mage invisible you he said you
[22:30] are the purpose you are the pure virtue
[22:33] sinless Bride of the son of of the
[22:35] Living God every man and woman that's
[22:38] born
[22:39] born not just coming into it saying I'm
[22:43] in the message but saying I am born I am
[22:47] born I have come through the states of
[22:49] justification sanctification and I have
[22:52] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost I am
[22:55] born of the spirit of born of the SP
[22:58] spirit of God and wash in the blood of
[23:01] Jesus Christ and believe every word so
[23:04] now he telling us he telling us praise
[23:08] God that's all right I like that guy
[23:10] right there he up on his game he see
[23:14] eyes h words now I can see that and now
[23:17] he said wash in the blood of Jesus
[23:19] Christ and believe whatever word how can
[23:23] you claim I'm part of God and deny the
[23:26] word right how you ever that you of God
[23:28] se you can accept every word of God
[23:32] that's the CH that's the revelation of
[23:34] your body change you got to have every
[23:38] word your body is built by word upon
[23:40] word until you go back into a change H
[23:43] so it goes in here says he said believe
[23:45] every word of God believe every word of
[23:47] God in stand as though you never sin in
[23:50] the first place and he said now you you
[23:53] are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ
[23:56] how how can you any man then he goes on
[23:59] and say the name parag right it says
[24:02] here and he said I was supposed to die
[24:06] in the morning and somebody took my
[24:08] place so now you go back here like I
[24:11] like what you know he was using this
[24:12] morning a lot of people say when Adam
[24:14] like he said that is incorrect teaching

[29:00] more you eat the B right it
[29:04] materializing CH in
[29:06] you Hallelujah that's right I you said
[29:10] brother see this is the whole revelation
[29:12] of it done made it looks so mysterious
[29:14] like it has not got nothing to do with
[29:16] you but the seven seal revealed the
[29:18] Antichrist Spirit show you the devil was
[29:22] that Define the power of Satan that
[29:24] Satan have no power over you because we
[29:26] know who he is right only re he had
[29:29] power on us before we knew who he was we
[29:31] didn't understand how religious he was
[29:33] but when the SE was
[29:35] open it shows Satan a religious spirit
[29:39] riding a white horse look like he was
[29:42] the Holy Ghost in the first age but when
[29:44] the word was open what did it do it
[29:46] showed that was not the Holy Ghost right
[29:48] because he had a ball and no arrows
[29:51] Hallelujah it was an
[29:53] impersonator only the Holy Ghost can
[29:56] give us the revelation that God will not
[29:58] accept that kind of spirit
[30:01] Hallelujah that what this whole message
[30:03] been about Hallelujah other words he
[30:06] just didn't give us the seven Thunders
[30:08] is not just seven Thunder was the
[30:10] mystery that was entain in the seven
[30:12] seal but actually the seven Thunder is a
[30:14] little voice right exactly Hallelujah yo
[30:17] once Christ comes in you and you become
[30:20] the very revelation of the word your
[30:22] voice become God voice on H your thought
[30:25] become God thoughts right that what God
[30:28] trying to get us back to so the bride
[30:30] can speak death said the Lord and it
[30:33] going to happen right yes sir oh yeah we
[30:35] coming back to that right come on but
[30:37] you say but the point it is the problem
[30:39] we've been dealing with we have been
[30:41] dealing with this
[30:42] body this body is out of this body right
[30:46] here that we got now and God didn't
[30:48] intend for us to stay in this body right
[30:52] we in other word god ain't going to
[30:53] raise up a god a you know a lot of time
[30:55] people say redemption in is not based on
[30:58] replacement God ain't going to replace
[31:01] you with another body you ain't going to
[31:03] go down you ain't going to go down you
[31:05] ain't going to go down in this body then
[31:06] God say I'm going to go over here and
[31:08] find another body but he going to take
[31:10] this body right here and he going to
[31:12] raise it back up or changing amen into a
[31:15] glorified condition Hallelujah and into
[31:18] a glorified body Hallelujah and then we
[31:21] die before the rapture we go into a the
[31:24] body and in the resurrection we come
[31:26] back to the Earth
[31:27] and pick up a glorified body right
[31:29] because we canot eat a any body right
[31:33] and we going to Mar supper H we going to
[31:36] Mar supper we going to eat H God

[32:23] he would have broke the order of the
[32:24] Resurrection right right amen he would
[32:26] have he would have been completely a
[32:28] would broke the heart of it right only

[35:38] bloody what was it it was God that came
[35:41] down God was those S CS God was the
[35:45] mystery AG Christ is the mystery of God

[35:51] it was Christ that done it it was never
[35:54] a man that opened the seal and it never
[35:56] was a because there was not even worthy
[35:58] in heaven to do it Jeremiah was not
[36:00] worthy Joseph wasn't worthy Moses
[36:02] wouldn't worth but he needed somebody
[36:04] that was worthy right he needed a kid
[36:06] Redeemer right right come on brother

[51:38] talking about the word body we talking
[51:40] about hereo now you hero because we are
[51:42] coming to this I'm not going to be long
[51:44] today so y'all get ready I'm going jump
[51:46] out of here even though I got the shirt
[51:47] on I'm trying to put my PR Sho on now
[51:50] Hallelujah so in other words so we begin
[51:52] to realize here we're to be pregnant
[51:55] what with the revelation of the Holy
[51:57] Spirit what do this word pregnation that
[52:00] God put in the bride what do it do how
[52:02] do we know that he
[52:04] come he said the seven seal bring Christ
[52:07] back to the Earth Christ is the seals
[52:11] Christ is the word and Jesus said when I
[52:14] come how will you know he here he said
[52:16] because I will bring all things to your
[52:18] remembrance thing in the word it ain't
[52:20] you just catching your own mind you are
[52:22] catching the mind of Christ the Capone
[52:25] is mind everything that he said he's
[52:27] bringing it back to your
[52:29] remembrance right you begin to remember
[52:31] where you come from see you know we
[52:34] might have been daed for a while and we
[52:36] might have been sleeping when Adam
[52:38] remember God put Adam in a deep
[52:40] sleep the Bible said Adam was in a deep
[52:43] sleep but if you read the Scripture it
[52:47] never woke him up but then after you go
[52:50] did you noce that it never woke him up
[52:51] he was sleep God but when he you know
[52:54] when we say woke up but the Bible don't
[52:56] say that that he brought e to him so we
[52:59] realize here when did Adam get woke up
[53:01] when Adam SE got woke up and we B we
[53:03] found in Matthew 25 here come the
[53:05] bridegroom coming and the bride

[55:39] but I was still asleep for seven Church
[55:41] edes yeah that Bri they laid there and
[55:45] they had a Gloom on right but then why
[55:47] said the seven DS woke up right why
[55:51] because we were sleep we were in the
[55:53] world we was Gloom we couldn't see where
[55:55] we come from like like you said this
[55:57] morning looking through that all we can
[55:58] see is that but when them picture open
[56:00] the whole glass open and we see him face
[56:02] to face the bride in the word is the
[56:05] same
[56:06] person Glory hallelujah amen amen but
[56:10] I'm want going to deal with this here so
[56:13] we got to we we we going back to the
[56:15] form of a word body and you said brother
[56:19] what going to do it you're not going to
[56:20] do it metamorphis is not you done it
[56:25] manam morph is that you was already by
[56:28] predestination you was already a Son of
[56:30] God right you didn't become Sheep by
[56:32] rebirth you always with sheep God don't
[56:34] change species right you not you can't
[56:37] be a sheep and be made into a
[56:39] monkey cuz they were seed is of his kind
[56:42] so we begin to look here so we begin to
[56:44] look at the prophet of God he begin he
[56:46] begin to try to show us what what what
[56:48] we coming from and and the revelation of
[56:51] who we are so I'm going to use a
[56:53] quotation what brother used in the
[56:55] church Ed book and then when I use this
[56:57] one here in a church Ed book in uh uh
[57:00] Brother begin to talk about how to
[57:03] explain church at 152 he would say I
[57:05] want to explain the true bride of Christ
[57:08] in the mind of God
[57:11] eternally th through not express don't
[57:14] not express until
[57:18] until each came forth into the decree
[57:22] that's the the
[57:25] designated decree season as every member
[57:28] came forth It's Express and it took and
[57:31] it and it took its place in a body right
[57:35] we bypass
[57:37] theop we that's why we come to the world
[57:39] a sinner and we come to the word but we
[57:42] hear the Worden and it comes back and we
[57:45] hear it from our theophany that why he
[57:47] say we know Bri recognize just mess been
[57:49] eagle
[57:50] food that's your
[57:52] representation you heard from your the
[57:55] right what it is the word has been
[57:56] formed in you right not not on the
[57:59] outside we got a way out here it's on
[58:00] the inside right how remember the when
[58:02] you went into the king Cham it was not
[58:04] on the outside was in the inside what
[58:06] the kingdom of God a right say within us
[58:09] right amen so the word has been form
[58:11] within us right now and you say brother
[58:13] J is it important that I hear even the
[58:15] little man sometime message seem to be
[58:17] simple we say oh well that Ain that
[58:19] ain't deep enough what what you call
[58:21] Deep yeah come on right that no other
[58:22] deeper Revelation than Christ been
[58:25] formed in you the hope of
[58:27] glory because that's what change your
[58:30] body exactly Romans says he says here
[58:33] Paul said in Romans 8:11 say if the same
[58:36] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[58:38] if it dwell in you right it will Quicken
[58:41] your mortal body because God put the
[58:44] seed there to bring you back to a
[58:45] glorified body right now we've been
[58:48] Quicken from the things of the world
[58:50] like he said that sinful that sinful
[58:52] atmosphere of the world that had you
[58:54] under his Dominion that was
[58:56] Satan that never was you that was Satan
[58:59] had you under this Dominion but by the
[59:01] power of the queening power what he do
[59:03] it broke the power of Darkness the seed
[59:05] was laying in the Earth right when the D
[59:08] when the Gloom when that disc D when
[59:10] that all that glue roll roll away from
[59:12] there Earth the seed was already there
[59:15] and it Quicken what was there that what
[59:17] God done brought us before we sons of
[59:18] God and we need to you said brother J do
[59:21] I need to try to do it no you just need
[59:23] to yield to God right H you don't need
[59:25] to try to make it happen it'll happen he
[59:27] said he said this is a is a
[59:30] destinated she is also called the body
[59:32] of Christ it is very uh
[59:35] appearent practic whatever that she
[59:38] ought to be called for the call that she
[59:43] was predestinated him come forth the
[59:47] same s was eternally with with him and
[59:52] and then he go to oh praise God man that
[59:55] help me to see
[59:56] better I know I ain't in no glorified
[1:00:01] body man okay well man now did the gree
[1:00:05] I don't read that one
[1:00:08] right where right there where at to yeah
[1:00:12] right at the top okay okay go to
[1:00:14] say this this this designated decrease
[1:00:18] season even as a m came it expressed and
[1:00:22] took its place in a body just the bride
[1:00:26] is the literal spoken word see
[1:00:30] what and though she is feminine right
[1:00:35] right and in
[1:00:39] Destin she is also called the body of
[1:00:42] who of Christ it and it is
[1:00:45] very
[1:00:46] par that she ought to be called that for
[1:00:50] she was predestinated in him from that
[1:00:54] same s Eternal with him and is
[1:00:58] manifested manifesting God in a many M
[1:01:02] body where as once God was manifested in
[1:01:06] one member but before he can ever get he
[1:01:09] come A Man member he had to get a
[1:01:11] glorified body and release the
[1:01:14] blood even our Lord Jesus Christ and it
[1:01:18] goes on and
[1:01:20] says he said there now then here we are
[1:01:25] coming to a decl conclusion as Eternal
[1:01:29] logos God was manifested in the what and
[1:01:34] and in Jesus dwell the what of the
[1:01:38] godhead body right and he did he say and
[1:01:41] that every everyone that was in the
[1:01:43] father was manifested in
[1:01:46] flesh
[1:01:47] and whereby Grant gain the title of the
[1:01:53] son even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[1:01:58] see the point of it is God Don't Make No
[1:02:00] mistake right if you was there God you
[1:02:02] didn't just wake up and come to church
[1:02:04] by accident you didn't wake up to want
[1:02:06] to serve God by accident the reason you
[1:02:08] had a a desire to serve God because God
[1:02:10] put a desire you to serve him outside
[1:02:13] that you want you want free more agency
[1:02:15] you got a right you don't have to come
[1:02:17] to church but for some reason you got to
[1:02:19] thirst don't want to be like God he says
[1:02:22] here and he says here well may it says
[1:02:25] here yeah Eternal in his thoughts
[1:02:28] Eternal in his thoughts Eternal in his
[1:02:30] thoughts and yeah and I and our turn
[1:02:33] became the many member spoken word
[1:02:37] spoken word SE manifested in flesh and
[1:02:40] those Eternal thoughts now manifested in
[1:02:43] the flesh are the sons of what and even
[1:02:47] as we are called that word that called
[1:02:51] he said we are called right who God he
[1:02:53] called and what did he do he justified
[1:02:56] did he glorified if you call you got to
[1:02:57] come through the stages of the baptism
[1:02:59] and the Holy Ghost how you say you just
[1:03:00] don't if he called you he called you so
[1:03:03] you can come through these stages and he
[1:03:05] says here and he says here and call so
[1:03:08] he said we did not become seed by
[1:03:11] rebirth we were we were seed and
[1:03:15] therefore
[1:03:16] we we the
[1:03:18] we're reborn not only the elect but we
[1:03:23] can't be reborn
[1:03:26] only only the elect can be yeah can be
[1:03:28] reborn because we are to see we we to
[1:03:31] see is the reason we can be Quicken
[1:03:37] NSE there is nothing to Quicken none see
[1:03:41] will never will never become a word body
[1:03:46] bride they will go out they'll come to
[1:03:48] this message and the Bible say if we in
[1:03:51] God then we are conformed to be coming
