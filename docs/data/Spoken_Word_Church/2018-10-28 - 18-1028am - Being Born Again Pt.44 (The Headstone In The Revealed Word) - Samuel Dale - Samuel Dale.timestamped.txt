[12:47] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[12:51] liveth and abideth for ever
[12:54] okay now we're going to try to conclude
[12:56] the message today so we'll be talking
[12:59] about the headstone are we're getting
[13:03] the pyramid it we see it where it's
[13:05] charity love you know we'll try to get
[13:10] to that so let's go to Zechariah to
[13:12] bring out this thought and the angel
[13:15] that talked with me came again and waked
[13:18] me as a man that is wakened out of his
[13:20] sleep and said unto me what see us
[13:23] Dallas and I said I have looked and
[13:26] behold a candlestick all of gold with a
[13:29] bowl upon the top of it in his seven
[13:32] lamps their own and seven pipes to the
[13:34] seven lamps which are upon the top there
[13:37] and two olive trees by hid one upon the
[13:41] right side of the bowl and the other
[13:43] upon the left side thereof so I answered
[13:47] and spake unto the angel that talked
[13:49] with me saying what are these my lord
[13:53] then the angel had talked with me
[13:55] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[13:58] not what these be and I said no my lord
[14:02] then he answered and spake unto me
[14:05] saying now what are these things that he
[14:08] saw he saw this Bowl he saw these
[14:12] candlesticks he saw these left stands
[14:17] but what would what would be as trouble
[14:20] on saying when he asked him what you see
[14:23] well I saw a lampstand I saw bowls I saw
[14:28] that that wouldn't the point right a
[14:30] prophet is knows that he's getting the
[14:34] Word of God and getting it in the right
[14:37] order
[14:37] so what is this that he saw alright now
[14:42] we'll read the scripture and see then he
[14:44] answered and spake unto me saying verse
[14:46] 6 this is the word of the Lord unto
[14:50] Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[14:55] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[14:58] Hosts who art thou old great mountain
[15:01] before the ruled I shall become a plane
[15:04] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[15:07] with shoutings crying grace grace untrue
[15:13] it you may be seated the Lord had his
[15:15] blessing to the reading of the word like
[15:18] I said then why would a you know you you
[15:21] show somebody something and then you say
[15:23] what did you see well I saw lampstands I
[15:27] saw this I saw that I saw well that's
[15:29] what you saw yeah but what you see and
[15:33] he tells him then what he saw was the
[15:36] word of the Lord coming unto Zerubbabel
[15:40] and Zerubbabel you know would be your
[15:45] Joshua as we would call it you know to
[15:48] represent the end time leader and all
[15:51] we're not gonna try to get into another
[15:52] like that we're just gonna get in to the
[15:55] point to where we can cover the
[15:59] headstone coming crying grace grace all
[16:02] right now we've spent quite a while just
[16:06] to review a minute we've been this is
[16:09] forty-four sermons that we've been
[16:12] talking about being born again all right
[16:16] and coming down to the place to ending
[16:19] it all up in our thoughts and ideas you
[16:23] know about what all of these things are
[16:26] all right now then what is the point of
[16:33] being born again now we were born wrong
[16:38] born in sin shapen in iniquity etc
[16:41] alright so then we had to be reborn or
[16:45] as Jesus said you must be born again he
[16:48] said you must be born from above
[16:50] in other words born where he came from
[16:53] all right so then that would bring the
[16:57] new birth into the point and what is the
[17:00] being born again it's the birth of the
[17:04] word right now what else would be as I
[17:08] keep saying over and over what else why
[17:10] would you think of the new birth being
[17:14] anything beside the birth of the word
[17:18] it is not a natural Burke Nicodemus said
[17:22] could I go back to my mother come forth
[17:24] again you know would that cleanse me you
[17:26] know to do some something way like that
[17:29] and he's no well what I need to do that
[17:32] for City you don't need to do that you
[17:34] need to be born from above you need to
[17:38] have a new birth all right and see then
[17:43] when you get the new birth Peter then
[17:46] says you don't stop when you got a
[17:50] natural birth you didn't stop your
[17:53] process you just started your earthly
[17:55] journey of the process so when you
[17:59] receive the new birth you just started
[18:02] your spiritual journey and Peter says
[18:05] being born again all right being born
[18:10] again is a process taking place okay so
[18:15] now that should should tie together our
[18:18] thoughts of where we've been doing you
[18:21] know for quite a while you know on the
[18:26] message of being born again we come
[18:29] through the stature of a perfect man
[18:32] we've taught it over over Day weekend
[18:35] week out trying to get us to see I've
[18:38] asked you to read I'm not asking for a
[18:41] raising of hands cause it'd be
[18:42] embarrassing but to say how many of you
[18:45] have even read the Statue of a perfect
[18:47] man or even listened to the message well
[18:50] see then that way it shows that your
[18:53] interest is not in the the things that
[18:59] we try to bring out because we want you
[19:01] to know for a certainty that the Prophet
[19:05] said it all right
[19:07] see then that away it's not what brother
[19:09] Dale says this or that no no and it's
[19:13] not brother Branham said this it's the
[19:18] Word of God given unto us to wear that
[19:23] is God speaking to each one of us all
[19:26] right to give us understanding of the
[19:30] and the growth development we went to
[19:33] that showing that you know you add to
[19:35] your faith virtue knowledge temperance
[19:36] patience godliness etc is the growth
[19:39] development in your Christian journey
[19:42] all right we covered that that was what
[19:46] was eaten away in the Dark Ages the time
[19:49] you had up until about the fourth age
[19:52] you had them with Martin and and Columba
[19:56] and all of them coming forth with a real
[19:59] good understanding of the word and
[20:01] teaching the word and the Godhead and
[20:04] the things within you see the the
[20:06] cankerworm pommel worm locusts
[20:08] caterpillars start eating it away what
[20:10] was eaten away the new birth could not
[20:13] be eaten away because now you know you
[20:17] take even to the on the restoration of
[20:20] the bride tree see that life went into
[20:23] the roots you can't eat that away so
[20:26] ever church age had the new birth Satan
[20:31] can't take that away all right I thank
[20:36] God did that that is a truth that Satan
[20:40] cannot I don't care what he does he can
[20:43] not take that new birth away from you
[20:46] all right now he can and a lot of times
[20:49] stop you from receiving it because he
[20:53] perverts everything and does everything
[20:55] or make you think you know that you've
[20:58] got this or that or the other when it's
[21:00] not really there he can do those things
[21:02] but just remember if you ever get that
[21:04] new birth that's it you know that part
[21:09] is sealed the soul is sealed by the new
[21:12] birth and give an eternal life into your
[21:14] soul with the body and the Spirit is
[21:16] still out here in this natural realm all
[21:18] right now just trying to review a second
[21:22] okay then see the new birth is the birth
[21:25] of the word what else would you think
[21:29] about you see but I've spoken to her I
[21:31] said see you're talking about
[21:33] after-effects you're talking about a
[21:36] baby that comes into the world and then
[21:39] the baby cries and you're saying the
[21:41] crime is the baby no
[21:44] the crimes not the baby the baby's dire
[21:48] all right that's the after-effects are
[21:52] the things that happen with it are your
[21:55] evidence is okay which can go are you
[22:01] your experience of this or that I've
[22:05] done this I've done that I believe in a
[22:08] definite experience of the baptism of
[22:11] the holy ghost all right since you're in
[22:15] the prophets message I was born and
[22:17] raised a Baptist I didn't have no
[22:18] understanding of what it meant we always
[22:20] talk about a new birth but once
[22:24] receiving the message of the hour to see
[22:27] that it's the new birth is not to just
[22:29] believe God the new birth is not
[22:32] shouting it's not crying it's not
[22:34] they're speaking in tongues etc it's not
[22:38] those things it's the Word of God that
[22:42] is revealed to you there is your new
[22:46] birth all right
[22:48] then knowing the Prophet - what he
[22:50] taught it he said I taught it from the
[22:52] beginning future home see a lot of
[22:54] people say well he caught this and he
[22:56] changed his doctrine here will show me
[22:59] show me where he changed his doctrine
[23:01] see a lot of people like to get up you
[23:04] know that's why I like to read to you or
[23:06] at least quote to you what brought
[23:07] around and said cause a lot of people to
[23:09] get up and say brother Branham say it
[23:11] well you know that statement goes around
[23:13] the world and then you got a brother
[23:16] that was you know with the prophet eight
[23:18] with the prophet and don't only think
[23:20] and he's going around the world people
[23:22] looking to him like one brother said one
[23:24] time he said the worst part of it is he
[23:27] said you know said overseas said you say
[23:31] here we say Peter Paul James John now I
[23:35] won't call the names that he used but he
[23:38] said overseas they use brother so-and-so
[23:40] brother so-and-so brother so-and-so well
[23:43] that's all right if they teach the
[23:45] things that Peter Paul James and John
[23:47] talked but the point is that it's not
[23:51] taught that away and they take that as
[23:54] being what the Prophet saying
[23:57] because in a lot of cases they don't
[23:58] have any way of arguing the point first
[24:02] time true even to the the Philippines
[24:05] they had just begin to get books and and
[24:07] and things you know to be able to to
[24:10] bring the message to them because they
[24:13] couldn't argue with nobody you know I
[24:16] mean I couldn't argue with them because
[24:18] they didn't have the ability to argue
[24:20] you know they were to mercy of of the
[24:23] fact of what a little bit had been able
[24:24] to be brought their way alright let's
[24:28] see now listen that's what I'm getting
[24:29] at though the new birth is the birth of
[24:33] the word right all right and that new
[24:38] bird puts you in the body of Christ and
[24:40] it was the the new birth in every age
[24:45] all right now I admit the growth
[24:49] development of a lot of that nuber that
[24:52] was what was eaten away with the
[24:54] cankerworm pond were local kennefa was
[24:56] eaten away the things the Prophet you
[24:58] know and the Apostles had talked all
[25:01] right we're built on the foundation
[25:03] apostles prophet Jesus Christ being the
[25:05] chief Cornerstone so then our problem is
[25:08] that we're still a lot in a lot of cases
[25:10] we're still just taking what somebody
[25:13] says only you know we're trying to make
[25:18] our own doctor no pointer issue that's
[25:21] why I like to say what did the Prophet
[25:24] say all right why did he say the new
[25:28] birth is he alright then we've got it
[25:32] and we read his answer What did he say
[25:34] this and we read his answer well I think
[25:37] it in the Cedars where it goes he said I
[25:41] think it doesn't have anything to do
[25:43] with what I think are you think it's
[25:45] what God said Jesus said you must be
[25:48] born again that was the first message
[25:51] that he preached alright and see then he
[25:55] told what the new birth is he said that
[25:59] you know it's it's like a woman having a
[26:02] baby in a thing so then when the Prophet
[26:05] taught the nuber wouldn't it so
[26:07] wonderful to wear that he'd say now in
[26:09] the days of Martin Luther
[26:10] he said just to believe what he said he
[26:14] said was great you know and that started
[26:17] the just shall live by faith and he goes
[26:20] on to John Wesley and he picks up
[26:22] sanctification then he goes on to the
[26:25] Pentecostals and picking up the baptism
[26:28] with the Holy Ghost so what they say the
[26:30] new birth is justification
[26:33] sanctification and the baptism of the
[26:36] Holy Ghost all right there's your new
[26:39] birth which is what the birth of the
[26:42] word what is justification it's the word
[26:45] what is sanctification it's the word
[26:47] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:49] it's the word made alive by the spirit
[26:52] into each one all right so we've come
[26:54] all the way down brought it to that
[26:56] point to where that we're we're
[26:58] fellowshipping around in in the life
[27:00] partner coming up through the virtues
[27:02] and bringing those into being and we've
[27:05] read from the Prophet how that you have
[27:08] faith to be you're born again at faith
[27:10] all right he said how faith and be born
[27:13] again then these are the things God
[27:15] expects you to add all right so that was
[27:20] the the restoration back to the faith of
[27:25] the fathers okay now he started out in
[27:28] his early part of his ministry and he
[27:31] would make statements that were
[27:33] outstanding and people you know that
[27:36] read the message they saw well we can't
[27:38] understand this because he said that you
[27:41] don't listen to him he's talking of the
[27:46] stature of a perfect man even back in 56
[27:50] on the old message called the inner veil
[27:52] or why were people so tossed about
[27:55] something I think they changed it but
[27:56] even back to that he said God walking in
[28:00] instrumentality on two feet in the
[28:04] people he was teaching the deeper depth
[28:07] of understanding that the Apostles had
[28:10] brought right and teaching that to us
[28:14] that made it confusing because he said I
[28:19] can conclusively prove that you are born
[28:23] again
[28:24] and then baptized into the body see we
[28:30] we had it all figured out we thought we
[28:32] was doing pretty good we come up with a
[28:34] point of the new birth we thought that
[28:36] was doing pretty good but see then he
[28:39] would say things like that and he'd say
[28:42] that was right and then he'd turn around
[28:44] and say he said I taught three processes
[28:47] from the beginning and he said never
[28:50] changed in one iota well whatever he was
[28:55] teaching in 50 may not have been the
[28:58] deeper depth
[28:59] yes pride right we understand that but
[29:03] he was teaching the new bird correctly
[29:05] when he started out teaching I believe
[29:08] that because he was a prophet and God's
[29:12] got opened the word to him okay it's
[29:16] like I've always said about it's either
[29:18] you got Peter in them trained by the
[29:20] Lord Jesus all of those years three and
[29:23] a half years and come forth with
[29:25] preaching the statute of perfect man
[29:26] Paul is a prophet God takes him to the
[29:30] backside of the desert keeps him out by
[29:33] self the only visits a little bit here
[29:36] in our different places in the book of
[29:38] Acts a couple of times you know and one
[29:40] time he'd say never conferred with any
[29:42] of them within one time he said taught
[29:44] with Peter and him well he never what he
[29:46] done he never got down into doctrinal
[29:49] issues or situations and he goes by his
[29:52] self and God teaches him the word on the
[29:56] backside of the desert he comes out and
[29:59] Paul and Peter are not teaching anything
[30:00] different it ain't Paul teaching one
[30:03] thing as a berth and Peter another thing
[30:05] they're teaching the same thing so
[30:07] whatever Peter taught Paul talk is that
[30:10] sensible if not they talk something
[30:13] different whatever Paul taught Peter
[30:15] taught whatever Peter taught Paul taught
[30:17] all right that should be settled but
[30:20] like I said he would say a lot of times
[30:22] statements I can prove you're born again
[30:26] and then baptize anybody he's teaching
[30:28] adoption he's teaching a growth
[30:31] development in Christianity I can say
[30:34] that you are born again by the new birth
[30:38] and then each one of these virtues is
[30:41] baptized into you you have a birth of
[30:44] each virtue as it comes forward
[30:46] we've been 40-something sermons on this
[30:48] you ought to know a little bit about it
[30:49] but you know I try not to be so much dry
[30:52] but I was sitting there I want to go
[30:54] time lord I need to just go back and
[30:56] start all over you know I need to back
[31:00] up 44 sermons and just start over you
[31:03] know because if you're not getting it we
[31:06] probably said hold it up until they get
[31:08] it he said didn't move on well see the
[31:12] it becomes to where you think well
[31:13] you're just doing it in stress no I'm
[31:16] trying to get you to see the Word of God
[31:17] if you don't see it you're the one that
[31:21] will get disinterested in it you know
[31:25] I've talked to seals I've been through
[31:27] the seals I've been through the son of
[31:28] man but it sure is interesting to me sit
[31:30] and listen to white preaching the
[31:32] message it's interesting to me for these
[31:33] little brothers you know to preach what
[31:35] they see that's interesting to me see
[31:40] yes I'm not one saying well I'm the
[31:42] kingpins got to come through me know
[31:45] when you think that you ain't too much
[31:47] of a fan either a better King or
[31:49] anything but now listen to what I'm
[31:52] trying to say see then that adoption
[31:58] stature a perfect man is the same thing
[32:00] all right what is it an adoption you're
[32:03] born into the family all right
[32:07] then that child has a tutor to raise it
[32:11] okay and it comes up through those
[32:13] things and and when it does it comes out
[32:15] with the nature of the father and then
[32:19] the child is given the authority of the
[32:22] father that's exactly what Peter is
[32:24] teaching because he's teaching you're
[32:27] born again as a baby in Christ and then
[32:31] you come up the statue of a perfect man
[32:33] as guards will read in a little bit
[32:36] seals these things into you and see then
[32:41] you have to go up to period you can't
[32:44] say well brother I ain't got time now
[32:46] let's go up your brother Connors
[32:47] ain't got time food with all that other
[32:50] go ahead
[32:52] you've had 50 years since the Prophet
[32:55] left to see and if you're still teaching
[32:57] stuff like that it'll take you another
[33:00] 50 so welcome to the real world okay
[33:06] because that's how plain I talk all
[33:10] right you say well what's the problem of
[33:13] us being here 50 years since their
[33:14] private us okay don't need to say it
[33:21] again
[33:21] oh how about you saying it Oh
[33:26] some of you did and some of you didn't
[33:28] so I got some that said okay you know
[33:32] this is amen brother Donnie says you
[33:35] know this is amen if you do it real
[33:37] strong that's really a big ati girl okay
[33:40] all right but listen see then the
[33:44] adoption the stature of perfect man is
[33:47] all the same as teaching the growth
[33:50] development of Christianity that was
[33:52] eaten away by the cankerworm pom worm
[33:55] locust in the caterpillar it wasn't a
[33:58] new bird that was eaten away it was the
[34:01] Holy Ghost in every age and they ain't
[34:03] no way the devil could take that away
[34:05] but he could take away the growth
[34:07] development of understanding in the
[34:10] Christian experience and he ate that
[34:13] away through those things but that was
[34:15] to be restored in the last days they
[34:18] took the Prophet 30-something years to
[34:21] come to preach the stature of a perfect
[34:24] land all right he said well I know how
[34:29] he was brought well I wasn't the one
[34:30] that said it
[34:32] come on and did did you remember this
[34:35] and reading the book you remember where
[34:38] he said he was up in the woods hunting
[34:41] and he got the scriptures of faith
[34:45] virtue knowledge temperance places that
[34:48] he said I got that just the other day
[34:50] well you know what if that's right he
[34:54] didn't have that quicken to him until
[34:56] that day all right
[34:59] not if he hadn't read it not if he
[35:01] hadn't brought things about it and
[35:03] picked up parts about it right but
[35:05] to bring it down see now he knows I've
[35:08] tried to explain that 450 to almost 50
[35:11] years here's a man with trying to
[35:15] explain what he sees you know a prophet
[35:20] sees a a wheel in the middle of the
[35:22] wheel things like that and he tries to
[35:25] explain it he tries to put it in human
[35:28] terminology and what is it what did we
[35:32] read here in in the scripture well what
[35:39] do you see well I see bows I see this I
[35:41] see that and then he said what did you
[35:44] see
[35:45] and don't you understand what you see ya
[35:49] see balls and and God said that ain't
[35:52] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[35:56] the word of the Lord that comes through
[36:00] the Prophet all right now forgive me
[36:06] let's see church they tried then to put
[36:11] into words what they saw and that's what
[36:16] the prophet has done in this last days
[36:19] to you and I he was to restore the faith
[36:24] of the fathers that's according to
[36:25] Malachi 4 right and then he was to bring
[36:29] his message
[36:32] well his message was his message right
[36:35] was to do that his message was to bring
[36:42] forth those understanding of the virtues
[36:46] and adoptions and I hear he hymns and
[36:49] you know all of those messages sure that
[36:53] was partyís message but that wasn't the
[36:56] whole that's it he says on the rapture
[36:58] message we'll read it the minute he said
[37:00] that was when this message come he had a
[37:02] message was to be brought and that
[37:08] message was to be would not be an
[37:12] addition to the world my lord look at
[37:17] the wonder
[37:18] situation or position he was standing in
[37:21] in 62 there when the Lord was opening
[37:24] that about the adoptions about the
[37:27] virtues and about those things what a
[37:29] wonderful thing it was to to stand in
[37:32] that place to think of God restoring
[37:36] back to mankind what he originally had
[37:40] in his word that's a wonderful thing but
[37:46] to think of that he said knowing all
[37:48] alone that the message would come what
[37:53] message do we have do we have something
[37:58] that do we have the Bible as the Bible
[38:01] and then we got a prophet as an addition
[38:04] to it now come on that ain't true well
[38:09] brother Branham no no wait a minute no
[38:11] it ain't true
[38:12] he's once said it I didn't they said
[38:16] what would your ability you could do
[38:18] this that he said you you you're doing
[38:20] wrong
[38:21] he said that's wrong he said because you
[38:24] can't add to he said it's got to be
[38:26] what's in the book all right in the book
[38:30] of what light had never shined upon
[38:32] something that was in the Bible
[38:36] now listen watch the faith of the
[38:38] father's being laying in the Bible but
[38:41] yet not understand by mankind
[38:44] the Apostle Paul comes alone and Peter
[38:49] named really didn't explain the
[38:50] indwelling are are the engrafting of the
[38:53] Gentiles they couldn't keep all of that
[38:57] straight they had trouble in in the book
[38:59] of Acts over the different things and
[39:02] and bringing in Paul did with bringing
[39:04] Timothy in and and they all had trouble
[39:06] Paul's the one who done it and what was
[39:09] Paul's great mystery was the engrafting
[39:15] of the Gentiles
[39:16] I remember that back in the Baptist when
[39:18] they would preach on the engrafting the
[39:20] great mystery cuz you could read it in
[39:22] the book I mean you could read what it
[39:25] was what is this mystery the engrafting
[39:27] of the Gentile are to bring another
[39:29] Gentiles into the body of Christ
[39:32] all right well see that wasn't a full
[39:36] historical that was just the in grafting
[39:38] of the Gentiles see what was the mystery
[39:42] of Revelations ten seven that one
[39:45] mystery it says which would cover all
[39:47] the mysteries what was that
[39:50] God sent a prophet to bring us to try to
[39:53] restore those things that were taught by
[39:56] the Apostles and once he brought that to
[39:58] a restoration then his message opened
[40:03] something I tried to explain to you over
[40:05] and over what is it that was in the
[40:08] Bible that was not understood by mankind
[40:13] now come on you say well it's in gray
[40:16] sure the engrafted of the Gentiles is a
[40:18] part of the mystery but that's part of
[40:21] the mystery that could be understood
[40:23] even in the Baptist we taught those
[40:26] things where were you at
[40:29] no wonder brother Brennan said leave him
[40:31] Baptists alone he said they'll tire you
[40:33] up with the word we tried our best to
[40:35] stay with a word we're arrestee I was
[40:37] Tooting it out to whistle having your
[40:40] glory hallelujah time but at least we
[40:43] didn't believe the word you know I don't
[40:47] care to say it I don't lie about it the
[40:53] Word of God has been there see it was
[40:56] there in the word the Gentiles being in
[40:58] grafted in but it was lost in the faith
[41:02] of the fathers and it had to be brought
[41:06] back and brought into clarity but
[41:08] there's more than just the engrafting of
[41:10] the gentiles there is a mystery that lot
[41:15] had never shined upon right here comes
[41:21] the prophets he's a pyramid sees each
[41:23] time which the top off looks down in
[41:25] these things you know no light have ever
[41:27] shined on these things what was that
[41:32] Matthew 24 the seals lot never shined
[41:39] upon those things as I said even to the
[41:44] basses and
[41:45] to emphasize so much that even Paul Paul
[41:51] never spoke of the son of man Paul never
[41:54] spoke of the mysteries of the seals
[41:57] Peter was there with Jesus when he said
[42:00] that and he never spoke of it that was
[42:06] withholding from them and like it was -
[42:11] Peter look who the men say I the Son of
[42:15] Man Hannah he is asking about the son of
[42:18] man what did Peter say thou art the
[42:20] Christ the Son of the Living God what
[42:26] did Jesus say he said upon this rock
[42:29] I'll build my church well on the
[42:33] revelation of Jesus Christ being the son
[42:35] of God we've really he was literally
[42:38] saying to Peter you didn't answer my
[42:41] question
[42:41] I asked you who the son of man you told
[42:46] me who the Son of God is we've got to
[42:48] build a church on that we said I'll come
[42:50] back I'll come back a son of man for
[42:54] just a little bit he said I'll bring it
[43:00] forth that was what was something was so
[43:02] great to me when I saw it I told you
[43:04] listen to the tapes going to working
[43:06] back well for one week we didn't nobody
[43:09] you know anybody any one of the four of
[43:11] us would choose a tape bring it we had
[43:13] one of those players with the batteries
[43:14] and and everything and that thing has
[43:17] run down them any time but it have
[43:19] enough power to run the voice I set tire
[43:22] with my finger and turned that tape for
[43:25] an hour would you do that
[43:29] no you just found the book and you close
[43:34] it up and forehead
[43:35] I've set there and turned that thing for
[43:37] us to listen because it had enough on
[43:40] the batteries to bring the voice in okay
[43:43] because the I'm concerned but about day
[43:47] five it struck me the unveiling of God
[43:50] it struck called brother Branham had
[43:54] always said God come in three sons nine
[43:58] son of an Sun God son of David I knew
[44:04] there was a problem and I couldn't
[44:07] figure it out cuz I knew they had to be
[44:09] a son of man come back in this time I
[44:12] had studied the message and I knew that
[44:14] something was wrong with our
[44:15] understanding I see in them the message
[44:19] on the valent he said just for a moment
[44:21] he comes back as son of man
[44:24] oh I said glory I got it Lord its son of
[44:29] man who gave His life to release that
[44:33] son of God to come back through the
[44:35] church ages with just a little bit in
[44:37] the end time it would come back a son of
[44:40] man again and then go to son of David
[44:43] because you can't go from son
[44:46] the Jews will not be able to go from the
[44:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the
[44:51] Millennium it's gonna have to increase
[44:55] to them to understand of the Son of Man
[44:58] because son of man is the Millennium
[45:00] that's the resurrection o son of man he
[45:07] said I am the resurrection when you talk
[45:14] about son of man you talk about
[45:15] resurrection you're not even talking
[45:20] about restoration it's registered it's
[45:24] not that and it certainly ain't
[45:26] Reformation Laurent church what does it
[45:31] go to the Prophet had a message of we've
[45:37] been through that over he said not in
[45:39] the years of preparation we said when he
[45:41] begins to sound he had a message to
[45:47] bring what was his message those seals
[45:50] to be brought to the bride and it would
[45:52] open now listen I didn't write the book
[45:55] you don't hear him in 55 saying the
[45:58] Bible's becoming your book when do you
[46:00] hear that
[46:03] come on
[46:05] after the seals broke after the seals
[46:10] broke he said the Bible had become a new
[46:12] book that's why I tried my best to get
[46:17] you to read the titles of the messages
[46:20] after the seal
[46:21] he's priest one true and living God
[46:24] within he comes right back and he said
[46:26] if you have any problem in there in the
[46:28] seals and things and don't father and
[46:30] don't understand he said he didn't say
[46:32] go back and go through the seals again
[46:33] come on you ain't listening to the
[46:35] message he said go to Christ some
[46:37] history
[46:37] he said come back to this book why
[46:40] because DARS where he preached the true
[46:43] revelation of one true and living God
[46:46] was in Christ a mystery and that's where
[46:49] that we get to the quote from when we
[46:51] say brother branham what is the new work
[46:53] he said it's a revelation of Jesus
[46:55] Christ personally to you that's on
[47:00] Christ from history but do you follow
[47:03] what I'm talking about see then what was
[47:06] the message that the Prophet was to
[47:08] bring sure he was to do now what is it
[47:12] 327 Church age book I'm quoted at 50
[47:15] years What did he say
[47:17] this message of Malachi 4 they
[47:21] supplemented their revelation to himself
[47:22] or something in order I know but Malachi
[47:25] 4 will do two things 1 turn the hearts
[47:28] of the children back he said in 2 the
[47:33] second part is to reveal the seven
[47:35] thunders which are the revelations
[47:37] contained in the seven seals and it'll
[47:40] be these divinely revealed mystery
[47:42] truths that literally turn us back why
[47:46] people are scared of the seals then
[47:50] they're denying the point the Kate they
[47:53] can be turned back they can't you can't
[47:55] be turned back to the face of the
[47:56] fathers without without the opening of
[47:58] the seals
[48:00] show me how you probably just said that
[48:04] you arguing with healing Oregon with me
[48:07] well I think we can just that's just
[48:09] like saying well I know I'm born again
[48:10] so I don't need it I'll jump up here and
[48:12] beat brotherly kindness I'll just jump
[48:14] up your top we'll jump all you want to
[48:19] you're gonna get a flop through when you
[48:21] come down but that's alright but alright
[48:23] now listen what is the new birth it's
[48:29] the birth of the word right what is the
[48:37] new birth momentum it's the revelation
[48:40] of Jesus Christ personally to you cross
[48:44] the mystery of God revealed spoken word
[48:47] as original seed now for the birth of
[48:50] the word is Christ the birth of the word
[48:56] is Christ look at number four you must
[49:01] be born again
[49:02] false teachers bring false birth true
[49:05] prophets will bring the word the birth
[49:08] of the word Christ true teachers come on
[49:13] get that we've got a world is that prize
[49:16] yes
[49:16] well how many times you won't were
[49:18] brought around said a prophet isn't a
[49:20] New Testament preacher is the word
[49:23] prophet you say well he's wrong here
[49:27] with he's wrong over there so they
[49:28] didn't just forget it
[49:29] see you understand what I'm getting at
[49:34] but the one thing that has been missing
[49:39] what is the one thing that's been
[49:41] missing all right we've established the
[49:44] message of the Prophet I'll read some
[49:46] more in just a minute would be the
[49:48] opening of those seals and from that
[49:52] opening of the seals am i quoting you
[49:55] from the opening of the seals comes
[49:58] marriage and divorce is that a quote
[50:01] from him you know that everything that's
[50:04] revealed in the Bible is I don't know
[50:07] where you would call it revealed in part
[50:09] here and in fullness but the fullness
[50:12] would come through the opening of those
[50:13] seals
[50:14] what about serpent seed there was
[50:18] preached in 58 but the Prophet said
[50:22] revealed in the seals see then if you'll
[50:27] understand that you'll understand what
[50:28] I'm saying that here he comes forth on
[50:31] 57
[50:33] on this on the Hebrew Siri and over and
[50:36] over and over declares Melchizedek to be
[50:40] Almighty God but then when he comes over
[50:45] after the seals break what does he
[50:47] preached listen to the title who is this
[50:51] Melchizedek not who he was he knew who
[50:56] it was backg are now who he knows who he
[51:00] is and where he's at and it certainly
[51:03] not brother Brent him and it certainly
[51:05] not me and you but it is the entire
[51:06] bride of Jesus Christ she becomes the
[51:09] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[51:11] then holding brother branham and when
[51:14] she does that then she is the son of man
[51:17] made manifest I told you I talked that
[51:21] 1969 what I need to worry about it it
[51:26] was darkness still standing today but
[51:30] yet people don't want to hear something
[51:31] like that they want to hear some
[51:32] tantalizing that is tantalizing to me
[51:36] when the Word of God will tie together
[51:39] from Genesis to Revelation and I can see
[51:42] him to be the same yesterday today and
[51:44] forever are you with me so it's been
[51:48] what was that you'll see why did I've
[51:51] talked this over and over from 40 years
[51:55] ago all right now listen what was that
[51:59] the light had not shined upon the seals
[52:05] so there was a prophets message to bring
[52:08] the seals
[52:09] he said all alone not in the healing
[52:12] campaigns in there but he said knowing
[52:14] this message would come what is that
[52:17] message that's see if I can find that
[52:19] one hurry he's no no you should I'm his
[52:23] own rapture okay if you can get over to
[52:28] number six
[52:30] pull up numbers suit
[52:37] look what he says now there's a
[52:40] messenger above and it always a
[52:41] messenger on earth the English word
[52:42] messenger means we met English word
[52:44] angel means a messenger and the seven
[52:47] angels message while he was making his
[52:49] proclaiming his ministry then listen
[52:52] then when he began to sound forth his
[52:54] ministry not when he started out when he
[52:58] started out he started healing the sick
[52:59] and the afflicted and everything
[53:01] everybody wanted him but keep on going
[53:04] what did it get - they don't want those
[53:06] disciples not not been able to explain
[53:09] it but they believed it whether they
[53:12] could explain it or not they said right
[53:15] steel and believed it how could they -
[53:18] how could they tell if they were going
[53:21] to eat the flesh and drink the blood how
[53:24] could you do it they couldn't need to
[53:27] flesh what they believed what he said
[53:30] what was what he said not when he
[53:34] started out but when he got on down into
[53:38] his message how many times do we need to
[53:40] cover her brother Branham said it like
[53:42] that he said when he brought forth his
[53:45] Jesus started preaching he said long as
[53:47] he healed us in everything everything is
[53:49] fine but said when he began to talk
[53:52] about I and my father one see then they
[53:56] backed away from it
[53:57] because they couldn't do it alright but
[53:59] here's the one I won't go back to number
[54:01] five while you they're close because
[54:03] this is the one I want you to get when
[54:06] we talk about the birth of the word
[54:08] we've talked about that but this is the
[54:10] one I want us to think about if I don't
[54:13] get the rest of it I'll finish it up
[54:15] this is off the message the seeds shall
[54:18] not be heir with the shock all right 65
[54:22] Pentacles took speaking in tongues now
[54:26] watch him they deny the supernatural
[54:30] even Mary we'll get to that eventually
[54:32] one of these days in the minute even
[54:34] Mary denied the supernatural birth of
[54:36] the word when she said you know your
[54:40] father and I have sought you she denied
[54:44] it okay look she denied the supernatural
[54:47] birth Pentecostal
[54:49] Pentecost took speaking in tongues they
[54:51] denied the birth of the word that's
[54:53] exactly what it did
[54:54] it'll take so much it'll take so much of
[54:57] it but won't take the rest of it it
[55:01] denied the birth of the word just like
[55:03] Mary did now let's don't do that if you
[55:09] don't understand nothing whatsoever that
[55:11] I try to teach try to remember one thing
[55:17] the new birth is the birth of the word
[55:23] no I come to the older brother Dale and
[55:26] I come and I cried and I prayed and I
[55:29] felt this feeling and I got a new birth
[55:35] now you're right in the devil's traps
[55:38] because you can get all kind of feelings
[55:41] and signs and sensations and have
[55:43] nothing to do with the new birth why
[55:46] don't you say it right whatever directed
[55:51] you to the altar was the word you had
[55:53] heard what did it do with it I suppose
[56:01] the word they hailed they took that word
[56:04] and held on to it
[56:06] it's what took them to the Upper Room
[56:09] what took you to church
[56:11] I heard many of you tell your
[56:13] testimonies that you were sitting here
[56:15] you without you and in this church or
[56:17] that church or whatever and something
[56:21] just directed you to go was that you
[56:26] shout and screaming in the hall in the
[56:27] crowd something happened you heard
[56:33] something you would have been with me
[56:39] that day when I tried my best to get a
[56:41] brother and I was reading brother
[56:42] branham worth it he said that Mary heard
[56:44] the word from her mother
[56:48] and this brother he let it on me and he
[56:52] called me everything in the book he said
[56:55] I'm tired of this old mother
[56:56] doctrine that people's preaching someone
[57:02] he said yeah I'm saying it come from
[57:05] Mary I said well that's what the Prophet
[57:07] said he said Mary brought her the word I
[57:11] said where did it come for for everybody
[57:14] they heard the word you've got to hear
[57:18] the word before you can be born again
[57:20] well he didn't he didn't like that but
[57:25] that didn't bother me I was just trying
[57:27] my best to get him to see a simple point
[57:30] faith cometh by hearing hearing by the
[57:35] word you've got to hear the word before
[57:38] you can be born again now you heard it
[57:42] from somebody somewhere and as you did
[57:47] then God could quicken that because
[57:49] remember what we were talking about now
[57:51] give for a second Jesus Christ when he
[57:56] came he was rejected by the Old
[57:59] Testament people right you know what he
[58:02] would have been the headstone had they
[58:09] accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior he
[58:13] would have been the headstone and they
[58:21] turned that down that's why your prophet
[58:22] teaches it brings it out what that the
[58:26] headstone hadn't come yet well I thought
[58:30] two hit songs is her where'd you get the
[58:35] right to think I thought we're supposed
[58:42] to take them out our thinking that he's
[58:43] thinking but see he was rejected by the
[58:48] children of Israel the Old Testament and
[58:51] he was accepted by the apostles which
[58:56] were disciples as followers the Apostle
[58:59] means one sent so they were followed him
[59:03] as a disciple and they went to the upper
[59:06] room and then they were sent forth all
[59:08] right now he could not come as the
[59:13] headstone to the church
[59:17] even in a New Testament church
[59:20] why because they'd not heard the word
[59:21] all right now watch that it appeared to
[59:24] see they hadn't heard the work they
[59:26] heard what Jesus taught them and God
[59:30] quickened to them the things Jesus said
[59:34] but now you show me where he quickened
[59:37] those seals to the apostles you can't do
[59:41] it that was withholding that was kill
[59:48] all right would he come the head of the
[59:52] corner the Bible said you remember we've
[59:54] been on that another day the headstone
[59:58] to Israel became the cornerstone to the
[1:00:01] new testament bride he didn't become the
[1:00:04] headstone to the new testament bride
[1:00:06] sure he is her head come on
[1:00:09] but he's not the headstone because they
[1:00:12] rejected the headstone now listen before
[1:00:15] you can have the headstone you've got to
[1:00:18] have the cornerstone is that sensible
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:23] and if you want to make the headstone a
[1:00:26] great big steeple setting on the church
[1:00:29] we'll call that a headstone okay now if
[1:00:33] you ain't got the cornerstone to hold it
[1:00:35] up what you got then come on folks I
[1:00:39] hope you'd be onto the point to what we
[1:00:41] used to tell say well what would you
[1:00:42] hang it to we were hanging on sky hugs
[1:00:44] you ever heard add you've heard people
[1:00:47] talk about well what's that hanging on
[1:00:49] it's the Scott hook what does that mean
[1:00:51] that means it's held up in the sky
[1:00:53] according to hook up in the sky
[1:00:55] well now that ain't right so are you
[1:00:59] with me what I'm talking about
[1:01:01] before you can how the headstone you've
[1:01:04] got to get the corner stone look at the
[1:01:06] pyramid is this the headstone would it
[1:01:10] fit anywhere in here except a corner
[1:01:12] parts no you got to get it built up
[1:01:16] correctly you got to have the
[1:01:19] cornerstone and that's what Paul was
[1:01:22] saying to the heart decisions that we're
[1:01:25] built on the foundation of the apostles
[1:01:27] and prophets Jesus Christ
[1:01:29] in the chief Cornerstone you gotta get
[1:01:32] you stuff cornerstone correctly that's
[1:01:35] why it took brother branham 30-something
[1:01:37] years to preach that cornerstone to
[1:01:40] bring that cornerstone and get it to
[1:01:42] where they could build a building you
[1:01:48] can't bring the headstone straight down
[1:01:49] onto the cornerstone that's plain
[1:01:52] sensible
[1:01:53] we're not system where we got it my
[1:01:55] revelation glory hallelujah
[1:01:59] unless you're you revelation all right
[1:02:03] but listen so you got to get the
[1:02:06] cornerstone so what did brother Ryan
[1:02:10] have to do go back and read we'll get on
[1:02:14] it if you want to go back and read in
[1:02:16] Zechariah well let's just read that up
[1:02:19] I'll get it fast enough verse eight
[1:02:25] moreover the word of the Lord came to me
[1:02:27] saying the hands of Jubilate the
[1:02:30] foundation of this house and his hands
[1:02:32] shall also finish it and thou shalt know
[1:02:36] that I am the Lord your the Lord of
[1:02:38] Hosts has sent me unto you then who has
[1:02:42] who has despised the day of small things
[1:02:45] brother Minister that's God and
[1:02:47] simplicity for they shall rejoice and
[1:02:49] see the plummet in the hand of Jubal
[1:02:51] with those eyes which are those eyes of
[1:02:54] the Lord which run to and fro throughout
[1:02:57] the whole earth all right come on down
[1:02:59] who are these they're the anointed ones
[1:03:01] that stand beside the Lord who is the
[1:03:03] rubble and he's gonna take you back to
[1:03:11] the foundation because it doesn't say
[1:03:13] that is rubra bull he lays the
[1:03:18] foundation he don't bring the headstone
[1:03:22] because you got to get him in part let
[1:03:25] him do what he done thought around him
[1:03:28] in his ministry bring them on up into
[1:03:30] the message listen what is it then what
[1:03:33] is this message the rapture I'm rich I'm
[1:03:39] not responsible for it
[1:03:41] must must and I must salt yet say it and
[1:03:46] my message all the time knowing back dar
[1:03:50] under healing and so forth like that was
[1:03:55] just to catch the people's attention
[1:03:57] knowing the message would come and here
[1:04:00] it is what is his message come on now
[1:04:09] you got something you can talk about now
[1:04:14] you got a headstone you can talk about
[1:04:17] remember you got to get you cornerstone
[1:04:20] right because he was rejected as the
[1:04:23] headstone and he come become the
[1:04:26] cornerstone to the New Testament church
[1:04:27] all right that didn't bring the
[1:04:29] headstone to the New Testament church
[1:04:31] uh-huh you have to go down through then
[1:04:34] through faith virtue or knowledge
[1:04:36] temperance patience godliness Rosalia to
[1:04:38] talk about the headstone the headstone
[1:04:42] is the revealed word all right the new
[1:04:46] birth we covered that over and over the
[1:04:49] new birth is the birth of the word all
[1:04:51] right if that's true if you least
[1:04:54] settled out enough in your mind to think
[1:04:56] about then you order have be settled
[1:04:58] enough to know that the headstone can't
[1:05:00] be something difficult the headstone has
[1:05:05] to be the word that was not made known
[1:05:10] in the point of bringing to the
[1:05:12] cornerstone nursery seven seals it the
[1:05:16] Prophet Bravo come on
[1:05:19] there's your seals the headstone is the
[1:05:28] opening of the word all right we
[1:05:31] declared what the prophets message was
[1:05:33] to open those seals there was what was
[1:05:36] sealed up in the world that Lyda never
[1:05:37] shined no I'd have never shined on those
[1:05:41] opening of those seals mankind couldn't
[1:05:44] follow it there was no way cuz you got
[1:05:46] to get your cornerstone back in position
[1:05:48] you got to get Giroux beable where he
[1:05:50] can do this part and then this other
[1:05:53] part can take place
[1:05:58] you see then what the headstone to the
[1:06:01] church is you see why that I've always
[1:06:03] taught it
[1:06:04] I've always from the first thing when I
[1:06:06] saw it back in the at least in the 79
[1:06:09] and coming on in 280 that I saw that
[1:06:12] headstone as being the seals now listen
[1:06:19] to what I'm saying please the new birth
[1:06:23] is the birth of the word all right so
[1:06:28] you've got to hear the word first then
[1:06:32] it can be birthed right so the disciples
[1:06:38] heard the word and the Bible said they
[1:06:41] took it and held it and when the Holy
[1:06:47] Ghost came it made alive now listen the
[1:06:52] new birth is not the word unless the
[1:06:56] Spirit comes upon the word the new birth
[1:07:01] was not the disciples in the Old
[1:07:04] Testament hearing Jesus preaching three
[1:07:06] and a half years and two times in the
[1:07:08] Book of Luke it says he opened their
[1:07:10] understanding in John it says that he
[1:07:16] breathed on them and said receive you
[1:07:17] the Holy Ghost but that was the Prophet
[1:07:20] said that was a promise they had to wait
[1:07:22] till Pentecost right come on then you
[1:07:29] couldn't have the new birth in the Old
[1:07:30] Testament you could have a planning of
[1:07:33] the word and even a quickening to the
[1:07:36] degree that they held on to it because
[1:07:38] the Bible said he opened their
[1:07:40] understanding but they had to go to
[1:07:42] Pentecost to get it may why because the
[1:07:45] birth is not just the letter of the word
[1:07:47] you hear I never talked to her that's
[1:07:50] what you probably think when you say
[1:07:52] brother F says the new birth the birth
[1:07:54] of the word
[1:07:54] well okay then I read the message almost
[1:07:57] how's new work no no no no it's when the
[1:08:00] birth the word is made alive baby in the
[1:08:04] Mama's wound
[1:08:06] I'm glad we've got a profit we don't
[1:08:08] have to argue with nobody they say well
[1:08:11] the baby was alive is doing this forget
[1:08:13] it
[1:08:15] well sunset song forget it we ain't
[1:08:18] playing science the Prophet said a baby
[1:08:22] wasn't alive until it breathes a breath
[1:08:24] of life he said sure it's got wiggling
[1:08:29] muscles he's got a heartbeat it's got
[1:08:31] all kind of things but it ain't alive
[1:08:33] until that soul comes into that body so
[1:08:37] was it were the apostles they had the
[1:08:40] great mechanical machinery the prophet
[1:08:42] calls it they had up the mechanics which
[1:08:45] was the the the the quicken the word
[1:08:49] they had those things they could talk to
[1:08:51] Jesus about it but they're about two
[1:08:53] seals they didn't know anything about
[1:08:55] and that wouldn't open to him in the
[1:08:57] upper room right in the upper room was
[1:09:02] open to them what God wanted them to
[1:09:03] have which brought them to the faith of
[1:09:06] the Father all right what is the new
[1:09:11] birth when you hear the word and that
[1:09:14] word is made alive by the Holy Spirit
[1:09:16] Dyer is your new bird now are you with
[1:09:20] me not because you read it not even say
[1:09:23] well I've been in the message and God
[1:09:25] quicken this to me God quicken this to
[1:09:27] me God quickened thanks to me when I was
[1:09:31] in the Baptist Church I was in the
[1:09:39] Baptist Church when I said to my wife
[1:09:42] that before the end of the world come
[1:09:45] they gonna be two prophets he quickened
[1:09:49] that to me cuz I could read the Bible he
[1:09:53] quickened that the son of man was the
[1:09:55] resurrection son because I could read
[1:10:01] but that didn't give me the new birth I
[1:10:06] was listening
[1:10:08] I've done it listen 2/6 read six books
[1:10:11] and listen to two tapes in one day
[1:10:14] you've tried that you can drive 70 miles
[1:10:20] to Doral at that time and 70 back and we
[1:10:23] still doing those things why because all
[1:10:29] I wanted was one thing I knew that if he
[1:10:33] was a prophet then that word the message
[1:10:35] he brought that's what I told brother
[1:10:37] mode I said you can tell me what you saw
[1:10:41] you were there you saw the dead raised
[1:10:44] the sick healed I said you told people
[1:10:47] you know like brother Taylor and them I
[1:10:49] knew the Tatum's before I come into
[1:10:52] message but I said tell me what he
[1:10:56] taught and I'll know whether he was a
[1:10:57] prophet or not I sure I'm glad I got
[1:11:02] ahold of somebody that knows something
[1:11:04] about the Bible instead of this junk in
[1:11:06] the message
[1:11:07] you gotta believe that around with some
[1:11:08] prophet he had signs and wonders well
[1:11:12] you got to believe that well tell me
[1:11:14] what he felt well I can tell you what he
[1:11:15] thought I'm just telling you you've got
[1:11:17] you got to believe him to be a prophet
[1:11:18] you don't believe in to be a prophet
[1:11:20] you're gonna die and go to hell now come
[1:11:22] on you know it would turn that away to
[1:11:23] you right did that bring a berth see
[1:11:35] then what is the new birth as I've tried
[1:11:36] to explain you hear the word and then
[1:11:39] the word is made alive all right what is
[1:11:42] the headstone the Word of God that was
[1:11:49] never known by mankind in those seven
[1:11:52] seals but just because we can read that
[1:11:56] and because we can make the seals and
[1:11:59] the Ten Commandments the same thing as
[1:12:01] the Prophet said it was that does not
[1:12:04] give you a new birth until the Holy
[1:12:06] Ghost fold on you and quickens that unto
[1:12:09] you what do you mean
[1:12:12] I mean exactly one time you can't
[1:12:18] understand in
[1:12:20] thing in the Bible terminologies until
[1:12:22] you're born again that's when the word
[1:12:24] is quickened are made alive to you so
[1:12:26] the seven seals isn't this because
[1:12:28] you've heard it just because you read it
[1:12:31] doesn't give you the birth of that it
[1:12:34] takes the Holy Spirit to come down to
[1:12:36] anoint that well I heard the prophets
[1:12:38] say it praise God
[1:12:40] but that don't make it alive Peter and
[1:12:44] him heard Jesus say it and they had to
[1:12:47] go to an upper room to get the Holy
[1:12:49] Ghost to have the new birth so what is
[1:12:54] the headstone sure the headstone is oh
[1:12:56] those seven seals are C word but it's
[1:12:59] window seven seals is revealed to me in
[1:13:01] you now this is I've got an end it cuz
[1:13:06] there's no way to go wrong but listen go
[1:13:17] ahead to number let's get a couple of
[1:13:18] these go ahead to number eight please
[1:13:23] but you spoke a word a regional seed
[1:13:25] brother Brennan says it like this these
[1:13:27] last days true church bride Church bride
[1:13:30] comes to the headstone i watch her will
[1:13:35] be the super church a super race as near
[1:13:39] as the great headstone there will be
[1:13:42] much like so much like him even they
[1:13:45] will be in his very image in the order
[1:13:48] to being united with him they will be
[1:13:50] one they will be the very manifestation
[1:13:52] of the word of the Living God
[1:13:55] denominations can never produce this
[1:13:57] this will they will produce their creeds
[1:14:00] and dogmas mix with the word they can't
[1:14:03] do it but he says he's in the last days
[1:14:05] a true church bride comes to the
[1:14:07] headstone she's going to be a super
[1:14:08] Church now remember what I taught before
[1:14:15] it'll start all right the new birth is
[1:14:18] not because you heard the word read the
[1:14:21] word you read it all your life that is
[1:14:24] not the new birth it's when the Holy
[1:14:26] Spirit quickens that word to you then
[1:14:29] you have the new birth so we've had 40
[1:14:32] years or 50 to listen to the
[1:14:34] seals in The Times that's wonderful
[1:14:40] because the the seed can get into the
[1:14:43] field now you've heard the Prophet say
[1:14:44] it you got to get the seed in the field
[1:14:46] before it could be quickened I mean
[1:14:49] that'd be walking out here over this
[1:14:50] continent is asphalt in the spring of
[1:14:53] the year and said boy I've got a corn
[1:14:54] crop cuz I I planted it right here on
[1:14:59] this but weird the corn go I guess the
[1:15:01] birds made it but yeah okay but in huh
[1:15:04] you get the point listen what is the
[1:15:07] headstone first you got to find out what
[1:15:09] it is find out if it's for you because
[1:15:14] that's the new birth you got to find out
[1:15:16] what the new birth is and find out it's
[1:15:18] for you all right
[1:15:20] it's for them that the Lord have called
[1:15:23] right so what is the headstone it's the
[1:15:28] quickening of God's Word all right
[1:15:33] it's the making alive of God's Word I
[1:15:40] believe and I've taught it from the
[1:15:42] beginning now this is going to be me for
[1:15:43] a second so listen the church don't come
[1:15:48] together all at once you understand what
[1:15:52] I'm talking about
[1:15:53] Jews are dealt with as a group of people
[1:15:56] the Gentiles are dealt with as an
[1:15:59] individual all right so brother Branham
[1:16:03] could stand on this earth I've had
[1:16:05] people to argue with me and I said well
[1:16:07] boy you in bad shape because they say
[1:16:09] well well you know you can't how the
[1:16:10] headstone and die I said well then the
[1:16:13] Lord Jesus was in bad shape
[1:16:15] because he was the headstone and died I
[1:16:17] said brother branham aren't you gonna
[1:16:20] believe that at least he had the
[1:16:21] headstone and he died see because that's
[1:16:27] individuals remember statue of a perfect
[1:16:29] man individuals come up the church comes
[1:16:32] up all right individuals can be adopted
[1:16:37] into the family ahead of others we don't
[1:16:41] come all at once it ain't a church group
[1:16:43] that gets adopted all at once
[1:16:45] it's individual
[1:16:47] that are adopted in the body of Christ
[1:16:50] that's why some were ahead of the other
[1:16:52] statue of a perfect man there's people
[1:16:54] all up and down to me and way I believe
[1:16:57] all up and down this whole period that
[1:16:59] you're looking at there's people there
[1:17:02] and that's why the Bible said they
[1:17:04] without us cannot be made perfect
[1:17:06] there's something that somebody's got to
[1:17:07] stand to draw it
[1:17:08] alright so what are you saying I'm
[1:17:14] saying then the seals can be broke to
[1:17:16] individuals and be the headstone to the
[1:17:19] church and that person could be capped
[1:17:21] off but not as a group ask only how but
[1:17:27] cut them or read it to you okay but you
[1:17:31] get individuals that are adopted into
[1:17:35] the family and then the whole church
[1:17:38] will be adopted okay go ahead
[1:17:41] let's read it number nine individuals
[1:17:46] can be brought in but then the church
[1:17:49] will be brought in it will be to a
[1:17:52] church and then you got what the Prophet
[1:17:53] said and why he made these statements
[1:17:56] the dynamics and you know what its
[1:17:59] dynamics is dynamics is what the
[1:18:06] mechanics is the head or the letter of
[1:18:08] the word the dynamics is the quickening
[1:18:11] of that word all right
[1:18:12] are you with me the dynamics of this
[1:18:15] church
[1:18:15] look what it'll be will be a refilling
[1:18:18] of the Holy Spirit I love that I'm
[1:18:22] looking for something to happen I've
[1:18:24] always looked for something to happen
[1:18:27] well cause I could read the dynamics of
[1:18:35] this church will be a refilling of the
[1:18:37] Holy Spirit that we have work and
[1:18:40] watching in a small measure while the
[1:18:43] head is coming down to unite with the
[1:18:46] body okay but when the head and body
[1:18:53] unites together the full power of the
[1:18:57] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[1:18:59] exactly like that
[1:19:00] even the dead that's dead in Christ
[1:19:03] where hundreds of years will rise in the
[1:19:06] beauty of holiness and take a flight to
[1:19:08] the skies the dynamics is the Holy
[1:19:11] Spirit brother Dale are you expecting an
[1:19:14] outpouring of the Holy Spirit yes
[1:19:17] are you expecting a revival I've always
[1:19:20] told you I have a revival every day that
[1:19:23] I read this message in here not know
[1:19:25] world wide sweeping revivals opening
[1:19:27] hospitals no no no no no that's to the
[1:19:29] Jews get that out of your mind well why
[1:19:32] can't the bride have it because we just
[1:19:34] went through it just a few weeks ago
[1:19:35] brother Brown said he'd take them seven
[1:19:37] unknown thunders back there to wake that
[1:19:39] bride up well did he teach it right all
[1:19:45] right then where are we at the dynamics
[1:19:51] listen go ahead to number ten well
[1:19:58] brother give me a church full of the
[1:20:00] Holy Ghost
[1:20:02] now this is off of questions and answers
[1:20:07] in 1954 all right in Jeffersonville oh
[1:20:11] brother give me a church full of the
[1:20:13] Holy Ghost God will do in one year you
[1:20:16] think he didn't know back dark what he
[1:20:17] was looking at what all theologies
[1:20:21] failed to do in 2,000 years now watch
[1:20:25] him you wait till the anointing of the
[1:20:27] church really strikes home to that
[1:20:30] faithful the little remnant after the
[1:20:35] doors of the Gentile is closed
[1:20:38] God will anoint a church then okay now
[1:20:42] what's him he whose filthy let him be
[1:20:44] filthy still he who's righteous let him
[1:20:47] be righteous still he whose holy let him
[1:20:49] be holy still and God will anoint the
[1:20:52] church with the power of God and things
[1:20:54] will be taking place not only that see
[1:21:00] that's where we die listen not only that
[1:21:05] then but he's doing it now
[1:21:11] oh you mean God is anointing his church
[1:21:17] well what do you think's happening if
[1:21:22] individuals you agree with a head shake
[1:21:24] or something a minute ago that
[1:21:26] individuals we can get adopted into the
[1:21:28] family and not as a group so individuals
[1:21:32] of the fact as individuals can be
[1:21:35] adopted into the family and that's God
[1:21:37] doing it now
[1:21:40] that's him sealing people into the body
[1:21:43] of Christ as individuals but one day
[1:21:48] he's going to anoint the whole church
[1:21:50] and he'll do in one year that's
[1:21:55] wonderful
[1:21:56] he's I thought to be short that would be
[1:21:58] a mighty short one go ahead 11 and dwell
[1:22:08] and then we'll quit number 11 the statue
[1:22:13] of a perfect man now you should have
[1:22:14] remembered these into building the
[1:22:16] virtues building this one you up
[1:22:17] building this stature see it starts off
[1:22:20] with the foundation stone faith virtue
[1:22:22] or knowledge temperance patience
[1:22:24] godliness brotherly kindness now what
[1:22:26] does it do now you come up through faith
[1:22:30] works or not to information what does it
[1:22:31] do then they're waiting for the
[1:22:33] headstone which is love so an individual
[1:22:38] comes up to the statue of perfect land
[1:22:40] fiber sir and I'll attempt replacement
[1:22:41] Gardner's waiting for the headstone
[1:22:43] which is love charity all right know
[1:22:48] where God is love the waiting for the
[1:22:51] headstone would you love for god is love
[1:22:52] and he controlled and he's the strength
[1:22:54] of every one of these things that's
[1:22:56] right yes sir right in here right in
[1:22:58] here you see I got it in between all
[1:23:00] these little works in here and here are
[1:23:03] these little waves come what is that the
[1:23:06] Holy Ghost coming down through Christ
[1:23:11] now look at the pyramid Becca and see
[1:23:16] you look at what is saying the Holy
[1:23:18] Ghost coming down through Christ see
[1:23:20] Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is above all
[1:23:23] this way
[1:23:24] holding it together building of what a
[1:23:26] perfect church for the capstone to cap
[1:23:28] it all once it's been done it what's it
[1:23:31] been done again it's manifested through
[1:23:34] seven Church ages and seven church
[1:23:36] messengers all right now unless if this
[1:23:40] other
[1:23:45] go ahead number twelve statute of
[1:23:50] perfect man here you are seven church
[1:23:52] ages seven steps God building his church
[1:23:54] is like one person into an individual
[1:23:58] into himself the glory the power of God
[1:24:01] coming down through this welding it
[1:24:03] together
[1:24:03] therefore the Pentecostal people that
[1:24:07] let out the Lutheran that out the
[1:24:09] Westlands and thing doesn't know what
[1:24:12] they're talking about
[1:24:13] you see they lived in this part of the
[1:24:15] temple that's the way some people can
[1:24:18] come up that high and drop off but
[1:24:21] there's a genuine part of that keeps
[1:24:23] making that building come on I will
[1:24:26] restore self the Lord remember the bride
[1:24:27] trees in the night and in the evening
[1:24:29] time it shall be like that's when Christ
[1:24:32] the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down and
[1:24:36] sets himself at the head of the church
[1:24:39] look at you permit who is this this is
[1:24:43] Christ this is God this and all to go
[1:24:45] when he comes to set himself at the head
[1:24:48] when he anoints the whole church all
[1:24:51] right and he will resurrect this church
[1:24:55] being his own body in there is the body
[1:24:58] and the way God is expecting us as
[1:25:01] individuals to grow the way he has
[1:25:03] brought his church in to grow ever
[1:25:05] church age it becomes one big church
[1:25:08] that what are you expecting I didn't
[1:25:15] give him this one but it's from the
[1:25:17] message three kind of believers
[1:25:18] paragraph 97 that's the reason I do
[1:25:22] believe that when that bride is called
[1:25:26] out and elected and set in the book of
[1:25:30] life there will come a sound from heaven
[1:25:33] that will take such a baptism of the
[1:25:36] Holy Spirit
[1:25:37] into that bride that'll take her from
[1:25:40] the earth in a rapture in grace God
[1:25:43] promised it God promised it alright
[1:25:48] maybe I got too fast in the life's of
[1:25:50] trying to get you to see but I want you
[1:25:52] to see one thing you cannot have the
[1:25:56] headstone until you get the cornerstone
[1:25:59] and it placed in correct order the
[1:26:01] cornerstone is a faith of the father's
[1:26:03] the headstone is this message the
[1:26:06] Prophet brought the opening of the seals
[1:26:08] and then the things thereafter approved
[1:26:10] it was the headstone go look what he
[1:26:12] preached after the in future home Christ
[1:26:14] the mystery unveiling them God the one I
[1:26:17] love is the mighty God unveiled read
[1:26:19] that one and notice in it see on the
[1:26:22] unveiling of God he's unveiling Jesus
[1:26:24] Christ and brings him into bride form
[1:26:26] but on the mighty God unveil he goes
[1:26:30] straight to the bride and takes her
[1:26:34] through and then one of these days we'll
[1:26:36] get back to it that's where that he goes
[1:26:38] to seed not out with a shock and a
[1:26:40] things like that and he says Mary
[1:26:44] represented Pentecost and said Mary
[1:26:49] rejected the word we read it to her a
[1:26:53] little while ago Mary
[1:26:57] he says the seed is not and I watch them
[1:27:00] quote he said Mary's not to seed now
[1:27:07] naturally Marie was not to seed right
[1:27:09] naturally Mary born the seed which was
[1:27:13] Jesus Christ
[1:27:13] so Mary's not the seed but there's got
[1:27:17] to be a seed come and all people can
[1:27:22] talk about the seed what I was born with
[1:27:25] it feeding me if I'd born defeated me
[1:27:27] then I make it they know nothing about
[1:27:30] the Saint Mary was one who gave birth to
[1:27:35] the seed but the Prophet said she was
[1:27:40] not to see he was a carrier but yet all
[1:27:46] we can talk about seed it's whether you
[1:27:49] got something in here not
[1:27:51] I love where the Prophet said what is it
[1:27:56] it's representation from predestination
[1:28:01] he said well I've born to see brother
[1:28:03] Brennan said then you better be careful
[1:28:05] now I can quote pretty good sometimes he
[1:28:09] said Moses had that guilt he said he was
[1:28:11] born with he said ever individual is
[1:28:15] born with that gift in them now what are
[1:28:21] you gonna do with that quote because see
[1:28:27] you'd be a respecter of persons if you
[1:28:28] didn't get to everybody if you put some
[1:28:31] kind of seed in one person didn't put it
[1:28:32] in the other one so let's get away from
[1:28:35] that seed like that well oh if I was
[1:28:37] seated I'll be there be work well he saw
[1:28:41] me there right he went to hell and saw
[1:28:44] people he went to heaven some people is
[1:28:48] that being mean where's it being
[1:28:51] truthful see that's saying we can we can
[1:28:56] die quoting but do you understand what
[1:29:00] I'm getting at come on musician the
[1:29:05] headstone to this church is the capstone
[1:29:07] which is Christ what are you looking for
[1:29:11] brother Dale I'm looking for a bride to
[1:29:16] walk in the light of the word until she
[1:29:20] becomes the word then God will come and
[1:29:24] back her up yeah but we ain't got the
[1:29:27] signs and wonders why are you built on
[1:29:31] signs and wonders when you're talking
[1:29:34] not to prophet taught you not to deal on
[1:29:37] signs and wonders he said you getting
[1:29:40] the devil's trap here dealing with signs
[1:29:41] and wonders we hey we believe in signs
[1:29:45] and wonders right did the Prophet
[1:29:47] believe in signs and wonders but did he
[1:29:50] teach that you can get deceived by signs
[1:29:52] and wonders does the Bible say that if a
[1:29:56] prophet comes among you and gives a sign
[1:29:59] and it comes to pass
[1:30:02] but if he takes you to another God don't
[1:30:05] believe him now what God said because I
[1:30:09] sent him among you to try you brother
[1:30:16] Branham said I love this oneness itself
[1:30:18] the god of this evil age he said God
[1:30:23] wants to prove that the bride won't fall
[1:30:25] like Eve so he's got to put us through
[1:30:30] the task I just don't understand brother
[1:30:33] Dale why is everybody else being so
[1:30:34] great and all this other in this house
[1:30:36] and we're just so pitiful we just ain't
[1:30:38] got nothing going on we just all
[1:30:40] floating alone and just having problems
[1:30:43] I just can't hardly exist
[1:30:46] I've just got everything's after me the
[1:30:48] devil bit on me all week long praise God
[1:30:51] if brother al was here he'd holler amen
[1:30:53] he said brother Dale I woke up two or
[1:30:55] three times life not in the middle of
[1:30:57] the night I said you pray for me he said
[1:30:58] yeah I should wake him up earlier Lord
[1:31:00] then I didn't mean Ted and I said wake
[1:31:03] him up where you pray for me you can't

[1:31:31] bleed on you why don't you do like I do
[1:31:33] I just get up well if I wake up I'm what
[1:31:36] I get up and I walk through the house
[1:31:37] and I just pray for everybody here I
[1:31:39] just go a lot of times I go see it at
[1:31:41] the time I just pick them up and I name

[1:32:16] sincerely that's damn well we'll try to
[1:32:20] pick up some other thoughts now out of
[1:32:22] this series trying to end it up today
[1:32:24] with the hip stone being charity which
[1:32:28] is Christ and I love those statements of
[1:32:30] the game how else could a prophet make a
[1:32:33] statement and him being a prophet he
[1:32:36] said Christ coming down through God's
[1:32:38] Holy Spirit and what kind of language is
[1:32:42] that a theologian look at him and say
[1:32:45] why do you know where are you saying
[1:32:47] he said I'm saying what God told me to
[1:32:50] say it's the Holy Ghost coming down
[1:32:54] through Christ's Holy Spirit sealing all
[1:32:56] of these things together that's not many
[1:32:59] cards but it's a manifestation of God

[1:37:20] the beginning that I'm looking for a
[1:37:21] revival to strike but I'm in that
[1:37:24] revival i've told from the beginning
[1:37:28] back in the sixties the word the bride
[1:37:31] would be the fullness of the Godhead
[1:37:34] bodily quoting brother Branham I'll be
[1:37:36] glad to show you were there I didn't
[1:37:39] save him things he did well I just don't
[1:37:42] believe well then you don't believe him
[1:37:43] it ain't me that you don't believe
[1:37:45] that's why I quote a lot of things you
[1:37:48] got a face well you just quoted it wrong
[1:37:52] well okay now we'll leave that between
[1:37:55] God and us but if I said it you gotta
[1:38:00] say that part right
[1:38:02] I did say it and I never tried to make
[1:38:07] anything big or little I try to be this
[1:38:10] exactly what we're all supposed to be
[1:38:13] born-again believers come on I'm too old
[1:38:20] I guess I come down through and lived an
[1:38:23] old life coming through that we try to
[1:38:28] live decent in the Baptist Church we
[1:38:35] tried to live decent one because we're
[1:38:40] supposed to be Christian well I'm glad
[1:38:45] run around and come along tell us about
[1:38:46] hiring clothes he had to tell you that
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:55] my mother put on a pair of pants a
[1:38:59] pantsuit telling one time there's only
[1:39:03] time she ever wore anything like that as
[1:39:05] far as anybody knows but you know who
[1:39:08] gave it to her she put it on one time
[1:39:11] took it off said I can't wear that you
[1:39:13] know who gave her the my sister that her
[1:39:19] husband was a Baptist preacher
[1:39:22] she won't it hurt mama to wire clothes
[1:39:25] like that mama said I ain't gonna wire
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:34] did you see what I'm talking about see
[1:39:37] one of these days you'll realize the
[1:39:39] church is what God would put us wrong
[1:39:43] and it's still doing it because it's
[1:39:46] still dwelling in us we were to stand on
[1:39:51] the word and just forget the rest of it
[1:39:52] father we thank you for today and we
[1:39:55] pray that what we said is worthy I'm
[1:39:58] sorry for being like I am taller than
[1:40:01] screaming but I wish I could scream
[1:40:02] louder all we say have the voice to keep
[1:40:05] it up and preach all day long about you
[1:40:07] Lord because you know yourself what I've
[1:40:11] tried to do all the years and try to
[1:40:13] bring to the people a revelation of you
[1:40:16] Lord not a revelation of me or anything
[1:40:20] else a brother branham or anything but a
[1:40:22] revelation of you Lord and then all that
[1:40:25] other is wonderful because it has its
[1:40:28] place we love you and we thank you just
[1:40:32] let the people go and think about what's
[1:40:34] being said they want to know what the
[1:40:35] headstone is the revealed word this
[1:40:40] message is revealed to us Lord it is our
[1:40:42] head and what are the head would we want
[1:40:45] and to be guided by you have your way in
[1:40:49] Jesus name you dismiss
