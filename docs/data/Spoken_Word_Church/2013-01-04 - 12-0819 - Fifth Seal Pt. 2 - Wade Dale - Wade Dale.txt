with me Bill y's church for ministers meeting on Saturday and it would be late getting back Sunday so just keep them in your prayers keep us in your prayers keep brother Dale and I in your prayers cuz we're the ones doing the speaking at the at the ministers meeting on the Daniel 70 weeks right so that's a one preacher said that's a shin kick subject that's about right for a lot of people it's a shin kicking subject to me it's very simple can you write in a you know I was looking we need to find some darker colors maybe they got I've looked in here there's I'm surely there's got to be there's a what's the matter with blue and black some of these are about Brown I don't like brown but yeah that's better that okay all right for sister Freda alone we rid in brown nobody else who invited her to church that better can you see that I mean really if you can't see it let me know do I we've grown up now we don't stick tongues out at each other okay we've got Ryan and Gabby in here they're just children and they will pick up on that start sticking tongue out at their children all right fifth seal Grace Revelations chapter 6 now we've already been through the first four seals if you if you have any questions about those four since we have some new ones in here go back and look online because they're all online and you can pick up where we went from the first seal up to the fourth seal now we're in the fifth seal all right and I'll explain this a little more here and I'll I'll draw it up there again but uh I was looking the other day for some other colors we need to there there got to be some really bright like high defin colors now that we can use the ceiling so low I apologize but the glare off of that thing on here and hard to see so we just have to do what we can do one those neon colors neon colors yeah we'll we'll see what we can do all right let's go and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge I have that word underlined the bride does not anything so that could not be the bride anything to do with the bride that has nothing to do with the bride of Jesus Christ cuz it's that's not what we say we say forgive them Lord for they don't know what they do so this is a different group all right they CED with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true dust thou not judge and avenge our blood see on them that dwell on the Earth and white Roes were given unto every one of them in their theophonic condition because they're under the altar see you and I get eternal life the white robe supposedly we supposedly we get it here I said supposedly if you're not born again you don't have it all right but we get white robes down here when you're born again you get a white robe all right which is the righteousness of the saints that will tell you in Revelations over 19 I believe it is the white Rob and white robes were given unto every one of of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were there's another clue as they were should be fulfilled all right so now let's go back just for a second and look at this and I'll I'll do it over here I guess you can can you see it better over there or over here over there over here yeah okay all right well we looked at the church ages here's the church ages just to go back through one more time but I'm going to take take my time because you're going to have to see I want everybody to understand something and I don't want to be real critical about anything but but it's just my job it's a gift like dve said it's a gift I have you see this thing right here m now technically technically get it when you can technically you can't bend over and hide your normal Hy when you do does everybody uh two three four if that's okay then we have what is this love right now we know we see we receive the Holy Ghost here is that correct we don't wait till brother brand put Holy Spirit here on the pyramid cuz all this goes together the seals the Daniel 7 weeks the the the plagues the bows the statue of a perfect man MH it it's all intertwined you can't just take one subject and say well this is one subject depart from another no they all intertwined together right all right so we receive the holy ghost at Faith is that correct amen all right virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness I'm missing one in there but right there it is behind you if you want to look at it right we have Holy Spirit and then the Capstone is love just to be real honest with you you got to be here before you can understand these right okay now the faith of the fathers is what everybody had in the first church age remember I said talk to about that this down here was Faith but this down here the foundation was the faith of the fathers all right everybody understand that say amen amen okay right faith of the fathers then we went through the church ages and about the fourth age like we were talking about here the the fourth Church AE went down right went down in the ground they took on father son Holy Ghost baptism they took on eternal hell they took on Trinity they took on all these false doctrines everybody got say Amen participation today we're going to participate cuz if you don't say oh me or I don't I don't understand that but the faith of the fathers was here now what happened was it got eroded it wasn't that the word was not as powerful but Satan had put a a wrapper around it or a buffer around it or a Doctrine around it right Doctrine is what kills you cancer doesn't kill you and heart attacks don't kill you doctrin kill you cancer kills this guy doctrin kills the ones inside that you know Jesus said don't be don't worry about the guy that killed this thing he said wor about the guy that can kill the soul God's the only one who can kill the soul Satan can't kill anything he can kill this thing because of putting things on you but he cannot kill the soul God's the only one who can do that he made it he can kill it right so that's his priority but now Faith of the fathers was right here correct right had the word the power of the word working well right here in this fourth Church age this is Fifth Sixth and seven here in this fourth Church age it went in the ground died all right we showed it in a parallel over here but what I'm trying to show you is we had to come up to this age here which was what the eagle correct right all right and then we had to come to Malachi 4 which is he will restore the faith of the fathers to the Pentecostal children right remember Malachi 4 the first part Malachi 3 actually was to restore the faith of the Old Testament to the new right then this got eat down and then let's just read M you say well we read 100 times word got eat down not 101 101 times we're going to read this all right behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Greatful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children all right the old Pentecostal fathers to the New Testament children all right then as we go on up through the church ages that was lost then we come up into the eagle age where brother rown said he that that messenger of M would tie those Lo loose ends together well we got loose ends down through the church ages correct yeah and the Heart of the children to their fathers so the heart of these Pentecostal babbling children is going to be restored back to the faith of the fathers everybody got that to say Amen so we're supposed to act like what the foundation was all right so if we don't act like the foundation was we can't understand the rest of what's going on because in time in time TimeWise the Rapture takes place right here you what I say in time in time the Rapture takes place at the end of the seventh Church age now we know as a fact that the that the Capstone is to come down on to the people yes all right but the Rapture takes place here and raptures all these Church ages together correct everybody guys say Amen do all right the Rapture takes place at the end of the seventh Church age now remember you got to remember though that that seventh Church age I said time because time goes on the seventh Church age actually goes on into the Millennium what the problem said we're still in time we're still in time we're still in we're still in Grace until the white Throne judgment so we got to go through marriage supper Battle of armagedon we don't go through but you understand the Earth does Thousand Years Millennium they have to be raised back up white Throne judgment that's when time stops the the Millennium is a is still you're still in the old you're still in the old seventh day Sabbath Church age right we are resurrected sitting in Heavenly place out of the church ages in the eth day the Millennium is not Eternal it's a thous years One Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 day 5 day the the Earth is going to continue to grow we're going to build houses oh okay usually when you raise hand you KNE something just raise both of them praise God but that's right I mean time is continued but not for the bride that's why I said in time the Rapture takes place after the seven Church AE ends down here you everybody understand is that not confusing that's confusing say it's confusing everything okay all right so the Rapture takes place here now I said in time cuz the headstone has to come down onto a group of people to take us in a Rapture right but TimeWise the Rapture takes place right here which is Seal number one 2 3 Rapture takes place on the what four seal right for us takes place on the four seal because remember we read the fifth seal there's no combat Beast there's no coming SE right everything's gone see then the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal and the seventh seal listen before I before we begin this is now set aside for you and I cuz the headstone could only come at the end time right there's a lot of people here's my point there's a lot of people going to go into Rapture let me put it this way 99% of the people that go into Rapture never is not going to have the headstone right 99% there's only going to be 1% of a BRI that go can you see me from there I want to I want to see me I want to see this this right here okay I don't care if they see me they see my finger but I don't care they see me I want to see this does everybody understand that though as a people only a small small group is going to have this Capstone come down on them to seal a group in cuz that's why people have a real bad problem and I know people even around here have preached that you don't get the Holy Ghost until right here because brother R he does make a St and he said you come all this way and you don't have the Holy Ghost yet well that's true that's not true you said oh you talking about a prophet no I know what he's talking about he's right in both places amen our mentality is wrong you got to get the holy ghost to have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience you got to have the Holy Ghost you don't understand the Bible says without the Holy Ghost you can't understand who Jesus is right and put his bodily figure in here that's right that's who he is we're his body you got to understand the body of God Amen all right cuz we are the body of God all right so you got to have the Holy Ghost first but this is a refilling right but if you'll watch where brother bandam gets up to the statute of a perfect man he says he said here Here Comes these waves and he draws waves down through here and what it's doing in it's sealing a group of people in right not giving them the Holy Ghost to take a Rapture but giving them the faith of the fathers and then adopting them into the family so that God seals it all together and that means you got all seven virtues working in your life everybody understand say Amen am okay so there's where we're at as far as we're looking at three things we're looking at the natural world all right CU when you get finished with the fourth seal Rapture takes place so you got to get in you got to put it into a bodily form and a spiritual form cuz we're not here when the fif F over but the fifth seal has to open to us down here right before we go there that's right right so there's only going to be a small group of people going to understand this because these people that are dead and gone on they can have a revelation of it but I'm talking about when it locks her together that's right okay when that thing comes down when The Headstone comes down onto a group of people they're going to be that's going to be the head which is who Christ that's going to be him coming to the body and it's only going to be a short period of time and we're going in a Rapture short period of time the only way we're going to take a Rapture is for that headstone to come down cuz the headstone has to come back only comes back in the end time when you said there's 90% 99 99 but was that all the seven the six Church ages 7 to seven Church AG is not going to understand seven Church ages not know where they were coming right no the only people that's well actually basically the only people that's going to make the change is the ones that are I mean make the physical change there's going to be aive everybody from today back they're dead right the race has run they finished their course they've done what God wanted them to do no shame involved at all that's what somebody asked me the other day about Sister Margaret uh atting about Gary you know Sister Margaret said well how do you explain that I the only way I can explain it's the way Dad explained it God was finished with it that's right right God's finished with you he's going to take you home you know what he gave a man 15 more years one time and that was the worst 15 years that man ever had right he should have went on when God wanted him to go on cuz what he done was he got into the permissive will of God and really messed his life up when you're ready to go when I'm ready to go if God wants to see me to the chains for the body chains I am heading toward that but if he wants to take me tomorrow then you know what my if I believe I'm a Child of God then then that's the perfect will of God my race is done I can't say no more when brother random was killed in 1965 his race was done he had already brought the message and it took a group of people then to be the voice the final voice to the final age in The Bride of Jesus Christ everybody got that so if if he's done with you then there's no shame you're going to come up in the resurrection actually you're going to come up before we get Ted so you're going to you're going to be you're going to be in a glorified condition before the ones that take the the body change that clock's not stopping today is it you know what even spiders come to church you're the Holy Ghost is that deep that a part of that Holy GH this is this is growing you up into this and that's the whole call that's the see the Deep call to the deep down here call you into the body then once you're in the body God doesn't quit talking to you that's right no he talks to you more yes and when you come to this right here see you've come you've come to what 99% of the people's not going to come to is a seiling in where God says hey if you're going to hear from this guy it's like Jesus as a type remember Jesus didn't need the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost but on the River Jordan he received the Holy Ghost come down as a dove and the father says this is my beloved Son in whom I please to dwell right here when he does that to you he says the same identical thing the night or day or moment you receive the baptism of Holy Ghost God said I'm pleased to dwell in that vessel but let's go on to faith I mean let's go on to virt let's go on to knowledge that's go and if you do walk up through this and you see that God because remember the sister Shepherd's dream it was a pyramid right brother brandham pulled the top off of that pyramid well when he pulled the top off it had to kind of look like this John going we going to pray we're going to pray for the sick one let's just put it right here can everybody see that this is a pyramid in itself this is not a complete pyramid remember brother Bram said the pyramid is not complete right you even say Jesus said I he the Bible says he's the head of the corner he's Chief Cornerstone what does the corner look like midd pyramid right so there she found found you got your little pyramids all the way up through here you got little pyramids and there's your Cornerstone then you start working on these things and it's not that you get virtue peel that off and hand it away and say I'm done with that no this is just I've always said this is just in here for reference purposes there are no lines in the pyramid that's right right there are steps right there's no lines cuz you're going to receive virtue the time that this happen you're going to receive knowledge at the time this happen so it's not that you're going to get all at once and then you're not going to need it anymore right no that's not the way it works but what was I talking about a minute ago when I left my point oh the Holy Spirit when uh sister shepher had a her dream he said he whipped the top off right and then what happened now I'm not talking about the one where he looked down in it and saw White Stone he's talking about sister Shepherd's dream right remember and the water started flowing out of the top of the pyramid what did he say was coming out trash trash that's not down here that's right here so we still got trash that's what he said he said trash was coming out and that's what's that's what happened to that water washing into the water of the word puts the trash but there's one day that this thing right here is going to have to just like when you seal a jar once that thing sealed like Daddy's preaching now about the sealing of the people once that thing sealed you get sealed into the body down here Jesus on the River Jordan then in a TI God took him upon a mountain and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him in other words he come to a position not that he needed to he was doing it for me and you Jesus's life was an example for us he was the he was the New Birth he was the Holy Ghost he was God he was Emanuel he was Jehovah he was all these things he didn't need to gain he didn't gain any new attributes remember God don't gain new attributes you always watch you and I have to gain new attribute yes CU this is the attributes of God yes all right everybody got that so the Holy Spirit once that pushes it out that Holy Spirit sits down there and seals that right all right seals you this is who in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him everybody understand yes all right then this comes down a little bit closer there's a there's a spot I want to I want to get on Statue of a perfect man that if you'll notice and it's actually of a perfect man and this this this kind of correlates with and I know it's a little little B here's an adult we're the female and God's the male right all right brother Brown said it's a diamond shaped pyramid or a diamond shape headstone you watch it you want read it it like a diamond so was a diamond a diamond this is what he's doing he's not just sitting down on us flat like this what's a diamond like that's a diamond right right he's not going to just sit down on top of us he's going all the way through everybody understand that I mean you watching brother BR he said A diamond that's a diamond this ain't a diamond this is a diamond diamond shape he said there's a flange to keep the water out well how you do that you got that thing so perfectly fit water just going to what low right down to him but it he's moving down through us he's not just going to sit down on top of us he's moving through us right you can bring that point all the way down to here if you want to cuz he started right down here where he started bringing you The Headstone yes I mean that's kind of we're kind of off our point but still it's a good thought maybe we'll teach on that when we get finished with this but my point today is is remember TimeWise the Raptor takes place on the four sale right all the brides gone yes this is bride Church ages right here there's no church age up here right that's not a church age all right everybody got that this is not an extra Church age now this is the Eighth Day that's eternal life now that truly that's what comes to you at the new birth in a baby form little be be baby form brother said it's a spot a spot but when you come to the when you come to all virtues working in your life so what am I trying to say you can take a Rapture after you kill that spider no you don't have to kill him yeah yeah see a Rapture the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal there's got a group of people come to this diamond shaped pyramid because it's got to when God sets down down on top of us as bride he's going to feel brother Bown said he'll F every fiber of your being and we go into Rapture see he hasn't F this right here yet that's right I said yeah he purchased it purchased it at Calvary but this thing right here has not been redeemed yet as far as a physical moment of Redemption all right wish still leave a thing alone listen to what I'm saying I would try to well the thing ain't going to hurt nobody but not listening to this is going to hurt somebody all right fifth six and seven seal is for the Redemption of this guy nobody in this point of time I said of time there's nobody in this point of time is going to need that that's right cuz they're usually they're all dead right only the alive and remain okay right so we got to understand that fifth seal we're going to show the natural part we'll start next Sunday show the natural part of the seal which is the 144,000 you say all the hang on a minute that you read there where it says it says right here testimony which they held in cown with the loud voice said how long and white robes are given unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were 144,000 got to be killed right that's right as they were they're Jews right so the 144,000 is what Jews there's not going to be another killing of the Jews Like Ian and Hitler cuz that's where these people are coming from right these people under this altar in the fifth seal natural seal is going has been killed because they were Jews period they don't know nothing about Jesus Christ they don't know nothing about the Bible except that it exists see that's why it's going to be the you're going to see the greatest move of Grace because God give eternal life to a group of people that didn't even want right that's right they still don't want that's right but God said okay I blinded your eyes so I can take a bride that's right so to be just to be a just God I'm going to give you eternal life for the testimony you held not the testimony of Jesus Christ you're going to seize the 144,000 is going to be killed for the testimony of Jesus Christ we'll see that in the natural part of the seal so we're going to go through next Sunday and probably a couple Sundays on the natural opening of that seal what happens during the natural time of that seal then we're going to go into the spiritual part of that seal and give you the timeline of it but I just want you to see this but I want you to realize one thing if you don't have all these virtues working in your life then then you're not just going to automatically get elevated to the cap Stone that's right yes sir you got to have all this working in your life it's got to be prevalent in your life not just show up every once in a while that's right the devil shows up every once in a while I mean the devil's usually there all the time God shows up just every once in a while sorry I had it backwards sorry yeah brother Keith and I were talking about this morning talking about living as humans we live as humans 99% of the time that's right we do 99% of time we live as humans and then every little once in a while we get a glimpse of God but you know what God has took that little Glimpse and he's going to break back he's going to open up and it's not going to we still going to live human lives but we're not going to be and it's not sinless Perfection by no means but we're not going to be bothered if we're still bothered by things we were bothered before people come on we got to be we got to get this thing right here this thing will take care we talked about it last Sunday a lot of you are just divorced some of your problems not killed them that's right I told y'all 90% of the people in this message I don't believe born again or they wouldn't act the way they do they're just Sanctified which is a good condition to be in but it's not a good condition to stay there that's right but I'm going to be say one hard statement if you're still doing the same thing you were doing two years ago I'm going to give you Grace two years ago if you're doing the same identical thing you doing 10 years ago where you been that's right where you been you come to this church you say the word of God's being preached in this church you say that everything's doing wonderful in this church as far as the word goes and then you still act the same way you did two years you get the Holy Ghost that won't happen that won't happen so let's start back here remember brother Dale said he wished I could tell all of you you weren't born again some of you even prove it but but you know what growing grace and knowledge just keep growing that's right get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will change you amen it will not just divorce your feelings that's right it will change your way thinking just like we're talking about this course that we're taking this Dave Ramsey course I mean that that's a carnal expression but it's changing it'll change your life thank you some of you for the email that you sent about that course how it's really helping you but but but to a person I told you I'll tell you the ones that not going to it to a person if you'll understand if you'll ask some of the people who took this course it brings a husband and wife closer together least not bring bring it makes you discuss things and and if some of you worked on your budget this week you did get close together I don't see any black eyes we hav have to pray for any broke arms or legs so maybe somebody sat down and done something doesn't it doesn't it do didn't it do that it really did it bring it brings you together and that's what you know if you can't if you can't live with your wife how you going to live with others cuz she's part of you okay but we got to start somewhere we got let's started the foundation I'm going to go through the fifth sixth and seventh seal but let's just let's just keep it back down here though and say God I need to be born again I need this thing that I've been dealing with for 2 years I need it out of my life and I put it on a calendar just like I told them guys down there at the at the baptism man when I went down in the water down there in Gil Georgia in 1998 when I went in the water when I come up out of that water I was the most empty individual you ever seen in your life I felt empty we hugged each other and cried for when minutes but that was the most that when I come up out of that water I said God I want this stuff dead and I'm burying it right here I'm not coming back up with it it's staying right here that's what I told them guys I said you put a steak in it right here say Satan right here is where you died oh yeah you got you got an opportunity to come and talk to me but you died right here and of course I've grown from there in Grace and knowledge I hope everybody's seen it with the June and I together have grown in Grace and knowledge through those years but let's not go backwards this is not a going backward gospel that's right everything's going up right he's taking us up into the headstone so that's where the fifth six fifth sixth and seventh seal really works in a group of people and you really not going to see it with just a very short time everybody understand that you're going to see it a very short time you're not going to see a great 2-year manifestation or or or a long manifestation of of God changing your your your being right it's going to be very short brother Brown said a short quick powerful message will sweep out what is that that's somebody that God seals in and says hey I'm adopting that guy or that girl brother or sister both they don't just adopt men we're all feminist in the body but somebody's going to be adopted and this is going to work in their life you're going to see so much grace where you're not going to see anything else that's suppos to help me more than anything and and sure I'm hard on things but but your life always speaks louder than your word that's right always you can confess all you want to but your life is always going to speak louder than words so let's work on this guy down here let's work on this and and work our way up I'm going to teach on the fifth seal Sixth Seal and seventh seal but you know what it's going to take a mighty group of people to get to that spot I'm talking about a mighty group of people and it won't be you doing it I promise you CU remember you died right down here that's right you died a long time ago you have a on the number time you sawce in yeah did anybody did anybody to L up I had 16 16 times good girl none of you other you did it 16 times do your homework thank you sister the brag on my mate 16 let's go we got to we got to get out of
