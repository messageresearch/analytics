[2:15] you
[2:16] as we cometh Saints
[2:28] for this you know that no home
[2:31] homeowners not unclean person not cover
[2:34] this man nor who is an adulterer who has
[2:38] inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and
[2:42] of God
[2:46] but because of these things come of the
[2:49] wrath of God upon all the children of
[2:52] disobedience
[2:54] being be not ye therefore partake us
[2:57] with them
[3:08] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[3:11] goodness and righteousness and Truth
[3:16] the Lord
[3:19] and have no fellowship with the
[3:21] Unfaithful workers of Darkness but
[3:23] rather reprove them
[3:33] but all things that are reproved are
[3:36] made manifest by the light for
[3:39] whatsoever doeth
[3:41] make manifest is light oh
[3:45] he says awake thou that sleepeth and
[3:50] arise from the dead and Christ shall
[3:53] give thee lights amen God bless you
[3:57] maybe see this
[3:58] foreign
[4:02] was more subtle than any beast of the
[4:04] field which the Lord God had made and he
[4:08] said unto the woman yea hath God said he
[4:11] shall not eat of every tree
[4:13] of the garden
[4:15] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[4:17] may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[4:19] garden but the fruit of the tree which
[4:21] is in the midst of the garden God has
[4:23] said You shall not eat of it
[4:26] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[4:30] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[4:33] shall not surely die for God doesn't
[4:35] know that in the day you eat you eat
[4:37] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[4:40] you shall be as God's knowing Good and
[4:42] Evil
[4:43] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[4:45] good for food and it was pleasant to the
[4:48] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[4:50] one wise she took of the fruit to her of
[4:53] and did eat and gave also unto her
[4:55] husband with her and he did eat in the
[4:59] eyes of them both were opened and they
[5:01] knew they were naked and they sowed fig
[5:03] leaves together and made themselves
[5:05] aprons and they heard the voice of the
[5:08] Lord God Walking In The Garden in the
[5:10] cooler today
[5:12] hmm
[5:13] and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[5:16] from the presence of the Lord God
[5:18] amongst the Trees of the garden
[5:20] the Lord God called unto Adam and said
[5:23] unto him or art thou and he said I heard
[5:26] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[5:29] because I was naked and I hid myself
[5:33] and he said
[5:35] who told thee that thou was naked as
[5:39] thou eat another tree orof I commanded
[5:42] that thou shouldest not eat and the man
[5:45] said the woman whom thou gave us to be
[5:48] with me she gave me of the tree and I
[5:50] did eat and the Lord God said unto the
[5:52] woman what is this that thou has done
[5:54] and the woman said this serpents
[5:56] beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord
[5:59] God said unto the serpent because thou
[6:02] has done this Thou Art cursed above all
[6:04] cattle and above every beast of the
[6:07] field and upon thy bellish yet thy go
[6:09] and thus shalt thou eat all the days of
[6:12] thy life
[6:13] and I will put enmity between thee and
[6:15] the woman between thy seed and her seed
[6:18] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[6:21] bruise his heel
[6:23] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[6:26] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[6:28] in sorrow thy shalt bring for children
[6:31] and thy husband excuse me and I shall
[6:35] bring forth
[6:36] nice conception in sorrow shalt thou
[6:38] bring forth children and thy desire
[6:40] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[6:42] rule over thee
[6:44] and unto Adam he said because thou Hast
[6:46] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and
[6:49] hath eaten of the tree of which I
[6:50] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[6:53] of it cursed is the ground for thy sake
[6:55] and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[6:57] days of the life then he goes on Thorns
[7:00] thistles and things all right because of
[7:02] what happened in the garden so you may
[7:04] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[7:07] the reading of the word
[7:09] now you'll see immediately that
[7:12] we're going to be dealing with
[7:16] uh
[7:17] the fall of Man
[7:21] and the uh
[7:23] things in relation
[7:25] we're not going to try to spend much
[7:27] time in proving a lot of things uh
[7:31] because
[7:33] I think that you and I should
[7:35] be far enough along to be able to
[7:37] understand and we can just State
[7:39] something and go on you know without
[7:41] having to explain it now to those that
[7:44] are on internet
[7:46] uh we have people out there that you
[7:48] know count this star their Church home I
[7:51] guess because they send their tithe but
[7:53] to the rest of you out there now this is
[7:56] to this church only you can listen in
[8:00] all you want to but remember don't call
[8:03] me to want to know the answer to a lot
[8:05] of questions you've done been told you
[8:08] go to your pastor or you go to brother
[8:10] Branham you know and whatever you do
[8:13] then do that because I'm not going to be
[8:16] an answer of questions because this day
[8:20] will be kind of
[8:23] a little uh
[8:26] into a point of something that I've been
[8:28] thinking on for quite a while
[8:30] but I believe it will open up a lot of
[8:33] things unto us if we'll listen but
[8:37] you'll try your best to figure out what
[8:39] I'm talking about before I say it and
[8:42] that's going to be a great hindrance to
[8:44] you and you will lock in and say well I
[8:47] believe this
[8:49] well that's all right that's your
[8:51] believing that's your choice
[8:53] but only do the only thing I do is ask
[8:55] you to listen
[8:58] you know as to what I'm speaking about
[9:02] and then uh you know go home pray about
[9:05] it
[9:06] uh you know come to me
[9:09] now of course I know what you'll do
[9:10] you'll go to everybody else and you'll
[9:12] you can't come on yourself about you
[9:15] know what things are that you don't
[9:16] agree with but just remember that Schism
[9:19] in the body and you'll answer to God you
[9:21] remember the message the other day
[9:23] called the church to bitterly fail all
[9:25] it takes is a little Yakety Yak among
[9:27] the people
[9:28] it won't come to me and talk about it
[9:31] you owe it to me first
[9:34] right right and see that Schism in the
[9:36] body so you'll answer to God you know
[9:39] I'm honest I'm just straight what would
[9:42] you do if you were up here
[9:44] you know
[9:46] and like I said what would you do if you
[9:48] was if you was up your ministering and
[9:50] you're having to preach to people then
[9:52] you're sitting there and going
[9:58] and every once in a while I might get a
[9:59] little
[10:01] just a tiny bit of an odd and brother
[10:02] Donnie Reagan said one time a little nod
[10:05] is a big amen you know you you didn't
[10:09] all right
[10:10] but that's your choice because you're
[10:12] going to do what you want to
[10:14] all right
[10:15] but just remember your warrant
[10:17] right you owe it to me first
[10:22] you went to me first
[10:24] then
[10:26] all right because we're going to get
[10:28] into something that's going to be
[10:30] surprisingly in a little bit
[10:34] and now I'm telling you up front now
[10:37] so here's up front now
[10:39] we will be staying only we will read
[10:42] quotes that apply but we will be staying
[10:46] only in the Old Testament
[10:50] nobody understand it
[10:53] only in the Old Testament in the types
[10:55] the shatters ETC because we got to get
[10:58] those things out of the way before we
[11:01] can understand
[11:03] and doing that then we can can leave it
[11:07] so everybody understand me now keep your
[11:09] thoughts in the Old Testament
[11:11] don't run over what I've got that you
[11:13] know you're uh you're where do we get
[11:16] there it might be a surprise when we get
[11:19] there
[11:20] all right you might be surprised
[11:24] all right now we know what happened in
[11:27] the Garden of Eden
[11:29] and how did it brought death upon the
[11:32] whole human race
[11:33] all right
[11:36] we do not believe that Eve ate an apple
[11:39] are some form of fruit
[11:42] all right
[11:44] because she said the serpent beguiled me
[11:46] or defiled me
[11:48] right
[11:49] and they made aprons to cover their body
[11:52] parts
[11:53] not to cover their uh
[11:57] mouth as a
[11:59] eating an apple
[12:00] they covered their
[12:02] Parts all right
[12:04] so that lets us know what was there and
[12:06] what took place
[12:08] we also know as we read in Genesis 1
[12:12] that it says the serpent is the most
[12:14] subtle of all beasts we know that's
[12:17] impossible to be both at the same time
[12:20] all right so first he was a beast
[12:24] all right an upright creature the point
[12:27] between uh the monkey and the Man In
[12:31] Darwin's theory all right
[12:34] and then he was made a snake
[12:38] serpent
[12:40] by the curse that was put on him off
[12:42] your your legs would go off you'll go to
[12:44] your belly you'll crawl you'll be a
[12:46] snake you know in other words a serpent
[12:48] all right now
[12:51] we know that they can't take those
[12:53] animals and they've surely tried to take
[12:56] the snake and made it back with the
[12:58] human race
[12:59] because God destroyed that so much until
[13:02] what he done he took that beast and he
[13:06] put him into
[13:07] the uh there was already snakes in the
[13:10] garden because you'd have to go by the
[13:11] species
[13:13] you know
[13:14] uh you know if you're going to believe
[13:16] in Creative Evolution you would go into
[13:18] all the animals would be created and
[13:20] they would have been snakes there but
[13:23] what he done he put it into the snake
[13:26] part so that would destroy the
[13:28] relationship to mankind
[13:30] as to be able to you know reproduce in
[13:34] any form between the snake and the the
[13:37] uh
[13:39] to mankind all right now we know that it
[13:43] was not fruit
[13:45] but we know that you are the fruit
[13:48] of your mother
[13:50] and your father
[13:52] that's what you are you're the fruit of
[13:53] your mother and father You're The
[13:54] Offspring the fruit of coming forth
[13:57] all right now
[13:59] I'm going to ask you because I've asked
[14:01] a few a little question
[14:03] I like to do that ahead of time you know
[14:05] and let you think about it I mentioned
[14:08] it a couple of times once I know from
[14:09] the pulpit
[14:11] but
[14:13] now we know that Eve
[14:17] had whatever you want to call it an
[14:19] affair
[14:21] uh with the Beast
[14:24] all right
[14:26] and then with Adam
[14:28] all right
[14:30] now the prophet says in the morning with
[14:32] the beast in the evening something like
[14:34] that something to the degree and he said
[14:37] as long as it's within a 24-hour period
[14:39] it can happen that you can have multiple
[14:43] partners and have children from you know
[14:46] different ones uh you know like that
[14:50] away all right
[14:52] but now what I want you to think about
[14:55] it will help us
[14:57] now I I've got a little sense I hope not
[15:01] much
[15:02] but I want you to think about this as
[15:05] Eve
[15:07] having
[15:08] two partners right
[15:12] now
[15:13] I want you to think about is Eve having
[15:16] two husbands
[15:19] all right
[15:21] now uh what was wrong with the little
[15:25] woman at the well she had too many
[15:26] husbands
[15:27] now she might have married all of them
[15:29] but was it necessary that she was
[15:32] married to all of them or
[15:34] or you know in other words go down to
[15:37] courthouse get to do this to do that you
[15:39] know the marriage see when we think of
[15:41] husband and wife we think of getting the
[15:44] the papers and signing them and writing
[15:46] them out you know and uh but I want you
[15:49] in your mind to think because it will
[15:52] help if I use the word husband
[15:54] and and I'll I'll try not in my mind to
[15:58] use that as much as using to Partners
[16:02] all right
[16:04] and in doing that I want to ask you a
[16:06] question
[16:08] you know
[16:09] she had two partners
[16:12] all right
[16:14] there's not a word for that
[16:17] in you know there is but I mean
[16:21] it's not the basics of words that we use
[16:24] they got the fancy words today
[16:27] but we talk about uh you know too many
[16:31] partners
[16:34] and knowing that
[16:37] that happened
[16:40] all right
[16:42] well then the question I ask is
[16:45] why was polygamy introduced
[16:53] and I know I know the word polygamy I've
[16:55] got it written down here's the
[16:56] definition
[16:58] it's really a dual type of word
[17:00] because Webster says polygamy is the
[17:03] practice or condition of having many or
[17:07] several spouses
[17:09] especially wives at one time
[17:14] all right so polygamy is basically used
[17:17] in our thoughts about a man with more
[17:20] than one wife
[17:22] but polygamy is can be used as a wife
[17:26] with too many husbands do you understand
[17:29] that's Webster's definition It's The
[17:32] Habit
[17:33] of mating with one
[17:37] meeting with more than one of the
[17:40] opposite sex
[17:43] all right so that's the definition of
[17:45] polygamy see you'd like to use for a man
[17:48] as you know for the woman has too many
[17:51] husbands one type of a word and a man
[17:54] for too many wives is polygamy and and
[17:57] but it
[17:58] you won't get it because even if you go
[18:00] to bigamy
[18:02] you know to try to Define it bigger
[18:05] means the crime of marrying while one
[18:07] has a legal wife or husband still living
[18:12] all right that's just what you call the
[18:14] word bigamy so we have to stay with the
[18:17] point of understanding
[18:20] that what happened in the garden was Eve
[18:24] had too many
[18:26] Partners husbands
[18:29] all right
[18:33] and we can't argue that point because we
[18:36] know that it's true
[18:37] right we shouldn't know that much about
[18:39] the what we call the seed of the serpent
[18:41] the things you know
[18:43] surely by now all right
[18:47] but why was polygamy
[18:50] introduced
[18:53] because that would be then we would
[18:56] Define the word now with the Bible form
[19:00] of polygamy
[19:01] the Bible form of the word polygamy
[19:04] would mean one male many females
[19:09] right
[19:10] the Bible form now we've established
[19:13] because it would not be you could use
[19:16] the word interchangeably but between Eve
[19:19] and the Beast and Adam would not have
[19:22] been called polygamy
[19:25] all right
[19:26] because that would mean she had too many
[19:29] husbands
[19:31] all right
[19:32] but why was it introduced that polygamy
[19:36] would come in to be
[19:41] my question is
[19:43] would polygamy take away sin
[19:50] I mean is this a story let's get it
[19:52] right because we'll make a movie out of
[19:53] it all right you know that's what they
[19:55] do today right
[19:58] so if Eve had too many partners did God
[20:01] get mad at her
[20:03] and say okie dokie you went your way
[20:06] and I'll go my way
[20:09] and I'll make you to be under your
[20:12] husband and you won't be allowed to have
[20:15] more than one
[20:16] but he can have more than one
[20:20] is that the curse
[20:23] and is it that polygamy would take away
[20:26] sin
[20:32] no
[20:34] in order to know better than that right
[20:37] man so now if you miss anything that I'm
[20:40] trying to bring remember that's the
[20:41] point
[20:43] that
[20:46] Eve had too many
[20:48] Partners husbands
[20:55] but then all at once
[20:57] polygamy is a lot
[21:02] all right
[21:03] and not only in the human race
[21:07] polygamy comes involved into the animal
[21:10] race
[21:14] right
[21:17] why is that
[21:23] well brother Dale
[21:25] you you yeah I try to make you think
[21:28] I'm sorry
[21:30] but that's just my way of preaching
[21:32] all right
[21:34] but see you get to think in the wrong
[21:36] way and you're going to cut off
[21:37] everything I say that's why I said to
[21:40] start with follow me
[21:44] on the bus go into like one brother said
[21:45] I didn't read my Bible anytime I want to
[21:48] listen go ahead but you sit there and
[21:50] write notes
[21:53] you can't write a whole lot of words and
[21:56] keep up with what I'm saying
[21:59] so jot it down in a hurry
[22:02] all right
[22:04] and connect back
[22:05] that's why I repeat a lot of things
[22:09] because I know what you do
[22:12] now you tell me you can write and
[22:16] and listen to what I'm saying
[22:19] you know you're none of your speed
[22:21] writers
[22:23] you know what I mean
[22:24] you're not people that can sit and type
[22:29] you know while somebody's talking
[22:31] that takes a special person to me
[22:33] so I know where none of us in that
[22:35] category you calling us dummies yeah
[22:40] you remember the guy the other day got
[22:42] in trouble you know a few weeks ago he
[22:44] got in trouble for saying you know
[22:46] Obamacare reason we didn't do it we're
[22:48] all stupid the boy they letting him have
[22:51] it so I guess you can let me have it
[22:54] but now
[22:58] there's a couple of items we've got to
[22:59] cover
[23:01] the word you won't go into the wrong
[23:03] category
[23:05] but I'm asking a simple question
[23:09] why was polygamy introduced
[23:14] all right
[23:17] wood polygamy
[23:20] take away the sin
[23:22] of Eve
[23:27] I don't think so
[23:31] now
[23:32] but to make sure you don't go into the
[23:34] wrong Channel with me on it I'll put
[23:38] this on here and it will be on other
[23:41] messages because I want you to know for
[23:44] sure
[23:46] we don't believe in polygamy
[23:49] all right
[23:51] now there's a plenty of people in the
[23:54] message that do
[23:57] you know
[23:58] I mean there's plenty of them dire in
[24:00] there but that's their business
[24:02] it ain't up to us in Lula ain't up to us
[24:06] to straighten them out
[24:07] just up to us to go in a Rapture and let
[24:10] them worry about their problems right
[24:14] all right but look what your Prophet has
[24:15] to say 1956 129 into Supernatural
[24:20] he's talking about polygamy
[24:23] and he said really that a nation that
[24:25] was in polygamy would really be better
[24:27] off
[24:29] he said because if you look in there
[24:31] see because we try to make the men of
[24:35] the world
[24:36] outside coincide with Christian doctrine
[24:42] all right
[24:44] he said polygamy would be better
[24:48] than because we make or try to make
[24:52] see people line up with Christian
[24:54] doctrine
[24:56] he said that's the reason we're in the
[24:58] mess we're in
[24:59] misinterpreted theology is that true
[25:03] but look what he gets down the site
[25:06] now remember don't you say that I
[25:08] believe in polygamy
[25:10] I don't
[25:13] all right we'll get to that in a minute
[25:15] but we want to get another one this is
[25:17] off the serp the 70th week of Daniel
[25:20] 1961 806.
[25:24] go ahead to 1B
[25:27] if the nations were they have polygamy
[25:30] in the Nations where they have polygamy
[25:32] it's a thousand times better
[25:39] and yet polygamy is wrong we know
[25:42] now get the point don't try to figure
[25:45] out all of what he's going through the
[25:47] uh the thing just get the point
[25:51] that in the countries where polygamy
[25:54] is legal
[25:56] you don't have as much problems as you
[25:59] do in America
[26:01] where it's just rampant on both sides
[26:04] right
[26:06] now that's what he's talking about so
[26:08] don't get involved in that get in what
[26:10] he's saying
[26:12] polygamy is not right
[26:13] now this is the point I said we want to
[26:16] stay in the Old Testament but here's the
[26:18] point
[26:20] when you come to the New Testament
[26:23] you come to
[26:25] man and wife
[26:29] which is supposed to be
[26:32] back like the original
[26:35] that Jesus said in the beginning it
[26:38] wasn't so that there was just one male
[26:40] one female
[26:42] all right so we're in the New Testament
[26:44] where polygamy would be wrong
[26:47] there is a little something there that
[26:50] we must deal with
[26:52] but yet keep in your mind what we're
[26:55] talking about
[26:58] because we're not in the tops anymore
[27:03] all right you can say well this this
[27:05] happened because of this and get the
[27:07] time that's good that's fine
[27:10] but
[27:11] I still asked a simple question
[27:15] polygamy can only type
[27:23] right
[27:24] no you can't take polygamy and do away
[27:26] with sin of guard in the garden
[27:29] that wouldn't be it
[27:31] in other words you say to the woman okay
[27:32] you've done what you've done
[27:34] so now
[27:37] you had two partners so we're going to
[27:39] take away your two and say you can't
[27:41] ever have but one but we're going to
[27:43] give your hubby the right to have as
[27:45] many as he wants remember we're still in
[27:46] the Old Testament type right
[27:48] all right
[27:53] but what I want you to think of
[27:59] would that polygamy how would it do away
[28:02] with sin
[28:08] and be done
[28:10] all right
[28:11] well we've come to the New Testament
[28:13] point of showing us that
[28:15] that we don't believe in polygamy it was
[28:17] legal in the Old Testament right
[28:21] how would you like to be an apostle Paul
[28:24] and brother Brian said he gave her grace
[28:25] how would you like to have been him
[28:27] going over to them in the Corinthians
[28:30] that's where he had the trouble
[28:32] and our sense of God with 10 wives
[28:36] and he's trying to be a Christian in the
[28:37] New Testament to have the baptism of the
[28:39] Holy Ghost what are you going to do with
[28:41] him
[28:45] I like what brother Theo harassments
[28:47] them done over there in Africa when they
[28:50] found those people just living together
[28:52] in the grounds and didn't know whose
[28:55] daddy who was what because they just you
[28:57] know
[28:58] living in a way
[29:00] they went out there and said okie dokie
[29:02] we start right here
[29:04] now pick out which one's yours
[29:08] and you're going home with that one wife
[29:14] because you can't do that in the New
[29:15] Testament and say polygamy is okay
[29:18] because you're already finished your top
[29:21] your body understand me
[29:23] we're not typing Christ in the church
[29:26] on the death Pentecost when the Holy
[29:28] Ghost came that was Christ in the church
[29:31] sure there's a reason that that body is
[29:34] a mini-membered body yes but just
[29:36] remember each one of us
[29:41] remember
[29:43] under the Old Testament taught he could
[29:45] have more than one wife but she could
[29:48] never have but one husband
[29:51] now we'll get to it we've got it
[29:54] there were if her husband be dead
[29:58] she's free to marry but only in the Lord
[30:03] so we'll get to that
[30:05] all right
[30:06] but I want you to think with me
[30:12] while you're under the types
[30:16] what was taking place that
[30:18] says that but let's just read let's read
[30:20] around them where you won't think I've
[30:22] got something on my own
[30:24] some of you people never read marriage
[30:27] in divorce and you'd be surprised how
[30:29] long you can get out and talk to people
[30:31] well I never read that message but they
[30:34] know how to explain it
[30:36] right
[30:38] or they can explain it to you to the
[30:40] detail and never read the message
[30:45] within the Daniel 70 week series with
[30:47] the brothers
[30:48] did you know all about it but you don't
[30:50] even have a copy of the drawing
[30:57] you know
[31:01] but isn't that something
[31:04] look what he says let's go to this one
[31:07] he's taken off a marriage and divorce
[31:11] paragraph 202 203
[31:14] look what the prophet said you see after
[31:17] the beginning it was something else was
[31:19] introduced
[31:20] and this is going to shock you
[31:22] I heard you tired going to know just sit
[31:25] still just a little longer
[31:27] then the double Covenant was made by man
[31:31] and woman now do you understand that
[31:34] after the fall a double covenant not a
[31:37] double Covenant of salvation
[31:40] now don't get tied up in that
[31:43] there's not a form of salvation for the
[31:45] woman and a form of salvation for the
[31:47] man it's all through the blood of Jesus
[31:49] Christ so get out of that
[31:51] all right but a double covenant What
[31:55] he can she can't
[32:01] that's the double cone
[32:03] she's used to rule over her
[32:06] that's a double Covenant so let's read
[32:09] it
[32:10] double code it was made by man and woman
[32:12] true sex
[32:14] another Covenant all together
[32:16] not the original Covenant but another
[32:19] Covenant
[32:22] because we'll read it in a minute
[32:24] were that it was never meant to be sex
[32:28] it was meant to be creation
[32:31] but now another Covenant is made
[32:36] Adam was told in the original condition
[32:39] to multiply and replenish that didn't
[32:41] mean he was told to go have sex
[32:46] no that's not your Covenant
[32:49] you know sex Covenant
[32:51] no no no no you got to get it right
[32:55] not the original Covenant but another
[32:57] Covenant now what's introduced
[33:01] polygamy in all
[33:04] and after the beginning polygamy was
[33:06] introduced in both in male and Beast Man
[33:09] and Beast
[33:11] after the beginning the fall
[33:13] now God secondarily sets a new nature
[33:16] Again by sex
[33:18] God created the first without sex do you
[33:21] believe that
[33:22] you're supposed to say Amen right
[33:25] now it's another Covenant with nature he
[33:28] sits it in another order by sex second
[33:32] Covenant one male
[33:35] many females
[33:38] one buck deer one whole arm of those is
[33:41] that right one bull a whole herd of
[33:43] cattle
[33:45] the cows
[33:46] one rooster yard full of hens is that
[33:49] right one David after his own heart with
[33:52] 500 wives with 100 children born to him
[33:55] in one year
[33:56] of different women
[33:58] a man after God's Own Heart one Solomon
[34:01] with a thousand lives but notice it
[34:03] wasn't so at the beginning
[34:05] but now it's after the beginning
[34:10] the woman has done this and she just
[34:13] becomes what she is now
[34:16] all right
[34:17] no
[34:19] a lot of people get offended because we
[34:21] read about the woman
[34:24] but we don't just beat on the women here
[34:26] we go down to the whole story
[34:29] but I still have to say it it was
[34:32] the woman's fault
[34:34] God that's true
[34:36] now we have to go with that because it's
[34:38] truth it's not beaten on nobody
[34:41] is telling truth
[34:44] so now watch what he says here
[34:47] did you get the point he created with
[34:49] without sex that's another Covenant
[34:53] word and under this Covenant
[34:56] polygamy is brought into being
[35:00] right that's allowed to be the word that
[35:03] would be a type of Christ in the church
[35:04] we know that
[35:06] right
[35:08] all right we'll get back to that but it
[35:10] was brought into being for that purpose
[35:11] but remember it's only a type
[35:18] a type won't save you
[35:22] right
[35:23] you're not saved by type
[35:27] amen top strong contemporary forms
[35:30] to draw you to the antetops perfect
[35:33] perfection
[35:34] but look what he says now that was there
[35:36] so we're going on to 2 30.
[35:39] number two now you notice in First
[35:42] Corinthians 17 notice Paul commands a
[35:46] wife that is that divorces her husband
[35:48] to remain single or be reconciled not to
[35:52] remarry she must remind single or be
[35:55] reconciled back to her husband
[35:57] she cannot remarry she must remain
[36:00] single but notice he never said about
[36:03] the man
[36:05] see you can't make the word lie
[36:08] from the beginning the sex law about
[36:10] polygamy
[36:12] now the word of gods runs through with
[36:14] nature of God runs in his continuity
[36:19] I've only dropped the point
[36:23] now First Corinthians is in the New
[36:25] Testament
[36:30] we're going to try to keep the type but
[36:33] remember it's in the New Testament
[36:37] though we must get some understanding
[36:39] are we going to go into Mass confusion
[36:43] right
[36:46] first before the beginning from the
[36:49] beginning there was just one and one
[36:51] after the sin came in then there was one
[36:53] man and a bunch of women run that way in
[36:56] nature every animal and human beings and
[36:58] nature of flesh is an animal we're a
[37:01] mammal we know that all of us and see
[37:03] it's all God's nature in continuity
[37:07] all right so what happened
[37:13] what happened in the
[37:16] Garden
[37:19] was Eve and the sin
[37:24] that took place and she brought it all
[37:26] down upon the human race
[37:29] but remember now Adam walked out
[37:33] willingly
[37:35] we want to say to try to type Christ
[37:39] that's all right but when he got out he
[37:41] couldn't type him
[37:45] right
[37:46] well he walked out he couldn't top
[37:48] crossed
[37:52] had he stayed in the garden
[37:54] and that Eve condemned and destroyed you
[37:58] might talk about Adam and typing but be
[38:01] real careful because you're you're just
[38:04] taking your presumptuous ideas
[38:08] because you're not using the prophet in
[38:10] these types
[38:11] right
[38:13] but now remember
[38:19] he can have more than one wife
[38:24] but she can't do that
[38:29] she can only have one husband
[38:33] we'll use this scripture over and over
[38:35] so go ahead to
[38:37] number 2A and let's read it
[38:40] Paul says in First Corinthians 7 and 39
[38:43] the wife is bound by the law as long as
[38:46] her husband living
[38:47] but if her husband be dead she's at
[38:50] Liberty to be married to whom she will
[38:54] only in the Lord
[38:58] see you stop that
[39:00] married to whom she will
[39:05] you make out anybody can't you but he
[39:08] was specific only in the Lord now
[39:13] I believe that that applies to the man
[39:17] as well as the woman
[39:22] we're going to get into this later maybe
[39:24] where the Pharisees come to Jesus
[39:26] tempting him
[39:29] remember he answered I'm blunt
[39:33] and there was no argument about his
[39:35] answers
[39:37] when he said from the beginning it
[39:39] wasn't so
[39:42] we said because of the hardness of your
[39:44] heart God permitted you
[39:49] so polygamy was permitted
[39:56] polygamy is not
[39:57] the perfect will of God
[40:03] so as I said to start with be careful
[40:05] how you use in your tops and what you're
[40:08] thinking all right
[40:10] he would say well I just married this I
[40:12] married that
[40:13] only in the Lord
[40:17] Believers are supposed to marry
[40:19] believers
[40:23] right
[40:24] well me and my husband well me and my
[40:26] wife wouldn't either she's a Believer
[40:28] but I wouldn't
[40:31] but that don't justify nothing to
[40:33] straighten it up
[40:37] I can't do anything about that but the
[40:39] kids come to me now
[40:41] and my kids didn't marry believers
[40:45] but they knew the story
[40:48] of what they were supposed to do
[40:51] and I didn't holler and scream at him
[40:53] said you can't marry that girl
[40:57] that had to be their choice
[41:00] thank God they married the ones they did
[41:02] and they came on the end to be believers
[41:05] all right
[41:07] but think about it
[41:11] it wasn't God's original plan
[41:17] you said well he had a plan back there
[41:19] and he was going to use he was going to
[41:21] do it with polygamy
[41:23] well be careful you're making him the
[41:25] author of sin
[41:30] but we know that polygamy came into
[41:33] being because God permitted it
[41:39] all right he permitted it
[41:43] but remember our statements to start
[41:45] with
[41:47] is he beating on the woman because of
[41:51] what she done
[41:52] and now said it's okay for the man
[41:55] or is he laying down something that will
[41:59] be used as a type
[42:03] God cannot make you sin and condemn you
[42:07] for sinning
[42:08] my brother's a Methodist preacher 12
[42:10] years College he said God can't condemn
[42:13] me for being the way I am he made me
[42:15] this way
[42:16] I said
[42:18] he didn't make you that way you made
[42:21] yourself that way
[42:23] he made you right to start with
[42:25] you made the wrong choice
[42:28] but now think about it
[42:32] let's go to who is this
[42:34] number three
[42:38] who is this priest in
[42:40] 1959 1004.
[42:44] why did God ever let sin come on the
[42:46] Earth
[42:52] God was one unit
[42:56] at one time
[42:57] in that unit was attributes
[43:01] and he was a savior
[43:03] by Nature he was a savior
[43:05] if there had never been a sinner how
[43:07] would he ever been a savior
[43:10] he couldn't save until he permitted sin
[43:14] all right
[43:16] isn't that true God's a Healer he cannot
[43:19] heal unless there be something sick Etc
[43:21] et cetera his own attributes projected
[43:24] these things
[43:27] there had to be something to respond to
[43:32] that attribute that was in God all right
[43:37] now
[43:39] he permitted sin
[43:42] he didn't make sin
[43:46] and neither can he take polygamy
[43:49] to correct sin
[43:54] he can allow it to type
[43:58] but remember a type is not
[44:01] the positive
[44:04] our correct will of God
[44:07] so
[44:09] he didn't make us sin
[44:11] he didn't make Eve sin
[44:16] he created her on a free moral agency
[44:18] now I know when they're laying on my
[44:21] desk at the house already printed off if
[44:23] you want to talk about it
[44:25] how that we can say well he made her
[44:27] that way he designed her that away where
[44:31] she could fall
[44:33] well now I've got another one in here
[44:35] that you can't argue with him about it
[44:37] if that's what he done
[44:43] now we know that he didn't make Eve fall
[44:49] but he permitted her to be born
[44:53] the way she was born
[44:56] remember Eve was not an original
[44:58] creation
[45:01] right
[45:02] she was in Adam
[45:04] she was a byproduct
[45:08] in Adam
[45:09] all right
[45:11] then when she was separated she couldn't
[45:13] fall until she was separated
[45:18] because the original creation can't fall
[45:21] all right
[45:23] so she was separated
[45:25] and made a byproduct
[45:28] and remember how the people of this
[45:31] message want to preach it you know
[45:33] a byproduct is comparing
[45:36] a big porterhouse steak to a ground up
[45:39] piece of hamburger meat you know and
[45:42] they say the man's a big older boy he
[45:44] blessed God but the woman she suggests
[45:48] an old spoiled hamburger
[45:52] that's what they call byproducts
[45:55] but you know you go look up the word
[45:57] byproduct it means something of the same
[46:00] value
[46:02] or even greater
[46:06] value
[46:09] we rode to church today
[46:12] in heated warm cars
[46:16] it's smooth and nice
[46:19] the beginning of that was an old Rattle
[46:22] Trap Rinky Dink
[46:24] a model or something which there were
[46:27] cars way back before then
[46:30] now brother Johnny likes to ride in it
[46:32] but he ain't gonna ride in that with
[46:34] Susan when it's 20 degrees
[46:37] and neither am I
[46:40] unless we're bound somewhere and it
[46:42] can't get no other way
[46:45] you understand what a byproduct is
[46:49] because Eve was in Adam
[46:52] in the original creation
[46:57] right
[47:00] then she was taken from that
[47:02] and now she's a byproduct
[47:05] coming from that product
[47:07] another product
[47:10] all right made what
[47:14] God didn't make her
[47:16] to be
[47:19] in a fallen estate
[47:24] right
[47:26] he made her perfect
[47:30] how can he create anything it's not
[47:32] perfect I don't care what you want to
[47:33] argue product byproducts God can't
[47:36] create anything imperfect so the woman
[47:38] wouldn't create it imperfect
[47:41] he was created perfect
[47:46] all right I didn't say Eternal I said
[47:48] perfect
[47:50] all right
[47:52] then she was given the opportunity of
[47:56] three more agents since she failed
[47:58] right
[48:01] she failed
[48:02] and you know what God permitted her to
[48:04] fall
[48:06] he didn't make her fall
[48:09] he cannot make you fall and judge you
[48:12] for falling
[48:14] now get that out of your mind well I
[48:17] can't help it he made me this way
[48:19] that's what women say you know
[48:28] so now think about it
[48:34] he's a Healer why
[48:37] because he already was a Healer
[48:41] he's a savior because he always was a
[48:43] savior how was he going to get that
[48:45] displayed
[48:47] without any
[48:48] form of being lost
[48:52] right
[48:56] so he didn't make her lost
[48:59] he made her with a choice
[49:03] her choice made her go wrong
[49:06] but now remember
[49:09] the original creation couldn't fall are
[49:13] you with me
[49:14] but now it took a pretty good tumble
[49:17] when Adam
[49:19] took his free more agency
[49:22] and walked over with Eve
[49:24] remember he had a choice
[49:28] and his choice was to
[49:30] don't want her
[49:34] but he made a choice
[49:37] and his choice was to go with her
[49:41] and I'm sure it was to try to save her
[49:45] you know
[49:51] you know we don't give Adam credit
[49:54] for being a child of God
[49:57] with a great understanding
[50:02] because he thought
[50:05] well
[50:06] if I go with her
[50:09] I can get her back
[50:15] right
[50:17] but that wouldn't work
[50:19] because when he walked out he found out
[50:20] he was lost
[50:22] all right
[50:24] no just being slow and thinking
[50:27] and that way he didn't make her wrong
[50:32] because if he'd made her wrong
[50:36] he couldn't judge her for being wrong
[50:39] I hope you understand that
[50:42] I'll get your well I think it's this way
[50:45] I don't give a hoot what you think
[50:50] it's got to be in that word
[50:52] you got a right to think yes as a human
[50:55] being sure that's fine
[50:56] but when it comes down to that word
[51:00] we don't have no right to question
[51:02] it's either right or wrong There's No
[51:05] Gray areas in God's word
[51:09] you see the right or wrong you know all
[51:11] right
[51:12] so then that way we can approach
[51:15] the Fallen condition as
[51:17] not God making a fallen condition
[51:21] but God knowing if he made her like that
[51:25] she would fall
[51:28] and she did
[51:30] but he knew enough about Adam with the
[51:32] confidence he had in him to know that
[51:34] Adam would walk out with her
[51:38] so it's not all just beating on the
[51:40] woman
[51:41] right
[51:44] remember
[51:46] Sarah was doing pretty good because she
[51:48] was willing to go with the King to try
[51:50] to save her a wubby's head but he was
[51:53] scared chicken-hearted you know he
[51:56] wanted to give her away
[51:58] because he probably had it in his mind
[52:01] I give her away God will take care of it
[52:05] you know that's a good point
[52:08] but remember you're planning it that
[52:11] doesn't work okay now let's go on a
[52:13] little look what he said on good does
[52:14] God change his mind about his word 1965
[52:17] 418 number three a
[52:24] well if the people won't walk in his
[52:27] perfect will
[52:29] but if the people won't walk in his
[52:31] perfect will
[52:33] he does have a permissive will let you
[52:36] walk him
[52:37] notice he permits it all right
[52:40] but he will make it work out for his
[52:43] glory I love that
[52:46] in his perfect will
[52:48] he
[52:49] so he permits it
[52:52] he permitted to fall
[52:55] that's his permissive will
[52:59] but he's going to take that
[53:01] and he's going to make it work out for
[53:03] his perfect will
[53:05] now dire is where polygamy enters the
[53:08] picture
[53:10] not as trying to save you
[53:16] come on not as trying to save you to
[53:18] bring in polygamy no
[53:21] but to try to start back toward the from
[53:24] the permissive to the perfect
[53:27] and he couldn't do it let me say it this
[53:30] way and wait let it be he couldn't do it
[53:33] no other way
[53:35] he would
[53:37] right
[53:39] that's right so he takes polygamy
[53:42] to start back toward
[53:47] the perfect will
[53:50] it's going to take a long time
[53:52] to bring that back into the perfect will
[54:01] see you're going to see and I'll go
[54:03] ahead and put it in you're going to see
[54:04] why he can but she can't
[54:07] if you'll pay close attention to what
[54:09] I'm talking about
[54:12] and that's still now
[54:20] might get you interested enough to think
[54:23] all right
[54:25] well look
[54:27] he permits it but he'll make it work out
[54:29] for his glory in his perfect will
[54:33] so he permitted us to be lost
[54:35] but he's going to bring it back to the
[54:36] perfect will right
[54:38] okay watch now just like in the
[54:40] beginning it was not God's perfect will
[54:42] for children to be born on the Earth
[54:44] through sex no sir
[54:46] no we knew it God created Man Out of the
[54:49] Dust to the Earth breathed the breath of
[54:51] life into him and he became a living
[54:53] Soul he took from that man a help mate
[54:58] and made a wife to him that was God's
[55:02] first and original will
[55:06] but when sin can't come in and did the
[55:09] thing that it did then he permitted man
[55:12] to marry a wife legally and have
[55:15] children by her
[55:16] multiply and replenish the Earth then if
[55:20] that's the way you're going to do it but
[55:22] you see it never was his perfect will
[55:26] was never his perfect will for it to be
[55:28] by sex
[55:31] all right
[55:33] he created Adam and Eve what's the
[55:35] problem of him creating you and I
[55:38] but what I don't understand and why
[55:40] people don't want to follow such a
[55:41] wonderful beautiful picture
[55:43] you know that he's right now creating
[55:45] you
[55:50] come on
[55:52] why can't we see the truth
[55:56] he started in that new birth and coming
[55:58] up that statue of a perfect man he's
[56:00] creating you right back like I tried to
[56:03] show between the two bottles you know
[56:06] that when we walk off this Earth we're
[56:08] going to be back just like it would have
[56:10] been had there been no fall amen
[56:16] amen why can't we wake up and these
[56:19] preachers oh boy I got this great
[56:20] Revelation I got this great thing you
[56:22] know the first thing you know how's the
[56:24] congregation going off in polygamy and
[56:25] the other half of them is going off in
[56:27] big of me another one going off in
[56:28] Higgins means and whatever other words
[56:30] you want to fart
[56:34] why can't we follow the truth
[56:36] so he's going to take his permissive
[56:39] will
[56:41] and he permitted it
[56:44] he used it as a type
[56:48] to type Christ in the church
[56:51] because he knew Christ in the church was
[56:53] not going to be now listen real
[56:55] carefully it was not going to be just
[56:58] Jesus and one person
[57:04] that would not be perfect will
[57:08] it was going to be Jesus with a many
[57:11] membered body
[57:17] but you know what
[57:18] neither one of them can have another
[57:20] husband
[57:23] and when it's all settled and done in
[57:26] case you get lost in what I'm doing
[57:29] it's all settled and done because one
[57:31] day
[57:32] Paul said
[57:37] it is the husband
[57:39] or one wife
[57:47] maybe we can find out something
[57:49] you say you mean to save it God would do
[57:54] this
[57:59] but I remember you
[58:01] in the scriptures he said so
[58:05] can
[58:07] clay say to the Potter
[58:10] why did you make me thus
[58:13] can't do it
[58:17] all right we're going to read a whole
[58:18] bunch right here so go ahead with number
[58:21] four on marriage and divorce we'll start
[58:24] on paragraph 148. I want you to read
[58:27] this
[58:31] you may now ask me why did he permit her
[58:35] to be designed thus
[58:37] now you can go into that and run your
[58:40] mind crazy and I'll be glad to give you
[58:43] the quotes to help you if you want it
[58:45] because he says Satan is her designer
[58:48] now Satan did not design Eve
[58:53] he's the designer of women today
[58:58] God designed Eve
[59:03] in a way that she could fall
[59:10] but didn't make her fall
[59:13] Satan's her designer now so be careful
[59:16] which one you're dealing with
[59:20] why did he permit her to be designed to
[59:22] us I don't want to take too much time
[59:23] because I got a lot more to say here why
[59:26] the question will rise then why did God
[59:29] make this woman like this why did he
[59:32] permit her to be like that
[59:34] it was for his own good pleasure
[59:39] oh
[59:44] God designed a woman exactly the way he
[59:46] wanted her design for his own good
[59:49] pleasure now not to where he could come
[59:51] down have a relationship with her no no
[59:53] no don't be stupid
[59:58] he designed her
[1:00:01] to where she would work out
[1:00:04] his perfect plan
[1:00:08] because he knew if he made her
[1:00:11] she would do it
[1:00:15] huh
[1:00:18] why did he make this woman like this why
[1:00:20] did he permit her to be like that it was
[1:00:22] for his own good pleasure now he gives a
[1:00:24] scripture if you want to argue with him
[1:00:26] about it now if you want to turn in the
[1:00:28] Bible just a minute
[1:00:30] let's turn to Romans 9 just a minute
[1:00:33] and show you something how God does
[1:00:36] these things if you want to to read it
[1:00:39] and you can see here what God does for
[1:00:42] his own good pleasure
[1:00:44] Romans 9 14.
[1:00:47] then what shall we say then is there
[1:00:49] unrighteousness before God
[1:00:52] when he chose Esau or chose Jacob and
[1:00:55] rejected Esau
[1:00:57] before either boy could have a right to
[1:01:00] make a choice
[1:01:02] himself neither one of them before they
[1:01:04] were born still in the womb of the
[1:01:06] mother God said I hate Esau and I love
[1:01:08] Jacob why
[1:01:12] why did God be like that
[1:01:14] because he knew what Jacob and Esau was
[1:01:16] going to be
[1:01:18] right
[1:01:20] that's easy that's just for knowledge he
[1:01:22] knew what he was going to do
[1:01:24] he knew what Adam was going to do
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:28] now watch him he said unto Moses
[1:01:31] I will have mercy upon whom I will have
[1:01:33] mercy
[1:01:35] and I will have compassion on whom I
[1:01:37] will have compassion
[1:01:41] yes but Lord you done wrong in my case
[1:01:45] you made me so of a woman until I can't
[1:01:50] live without a man
[1:01:57] he didn't make you that away
[1:02:00] you read too many Love Story magazines
[1:02:05] all right
[1:02:07] a lot of the things has gone on because
[1:02:10] of women reading about other things
[1:02:18] some of you are smiling and some of your
[1:02:20] frowning
[1:02:21] some of you know that you read the wrong
[1:02:24] magazine
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:30] because you see you wouldn't have known
[1:02:31] about these things if you hadn't read
[1:02:34] about them
[1:02:36] right
[1:02:37] are you understanding I'm trying to show
[1:02:40] you what's happening now to relate back
[1:02:42] to what happened back there
[1:02:50] okay
[1:02:52] God said I'll have compassion on whom
[1:02:54] I'll have compassion
[1:02:56] then it is not him that willeth not him
[1:02:59] that runeth but it's God that shows
[1:03:01] Mercy
[1:03:02] for the scripture says unto Pharaoh even
[1:03:04] for this sign purpose have I raised thee
[1:03:07] up that I might show my power in thee
[1:03:09] and that my name might be declared
[1:03:12] throughout all the Earth
[1:03:13] therefore he
[1:03:15] now watch here
[1:03:17] for he Mercy on whom he will have mercy
[1:03:20] in whom he will he hardens remember he's
[1:03:22] reading the scripture is why he's saying
[1:03:24] different things he's reading the Bible
[1:03:26] itself all right and saying his other
[1:03:27] words in between
[1:03:29] thou will say unto me why do I send us
[1:03:32] he find fault
[1:03:36] in other words if God made me wrong
[1:03:40] why does he find fault
[1:03:45] but he didn't make me wrong
[1:03:48] so he can find fault
[1:03:50] right
[1:03:53] for who has resisted his will
[1:03:57] man who art thou that revile us against
[1:03:59] God so the same form say to him that
[1:04:02] formed it why hast Thou made me thus
[1:04:05] hath not to Potter power over the clay
[1:04:08] of the same love to make one vessel to
[1:04:10] honor and to utter to dishonor
[1:04:12] what if God willing to show his Wrath
[1:04:18] and to make his power known endured such
[1:04:21] long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:04:23] fitted to destruction
[1:04:27] that he might make known The Riches of
[1:04:30] his glory on the vessel of Mercy which
[1:04:33] he hath before prepared unto Glory
[1:04:37] that's very simple reading to me
[1:04:41] God didn't make us wrong
[1:04:44] we can't blame him for being wrong
[1:04:47] he made us with a choice I'm talking
[1:04:49] about here not even even the garden he
[1:04:51] made us with a choice
[1:04:57] right
[1:05:00] and that choice that he made
[1:05:03] was because of what he knew we'd do
[1:05:05] is that sensible
[1:05:10] yeah then he didn't make me wrong I said
[1:05:12] oh God you can't blame me for being
[1:05:13] wrong boy that's going to be a good one
[1:05:20] I don't think the devil would even come
[1:05:22] up with that much
[1:05:23] all right
[1:05:24] now argue with that a while God did it
[1:05:29] he had to make it this way it had to be
[1:05:33] there now listen now for about five
[1:05:35] minutes I want to call your attention or
[1:05:37] something this is continual reading now
[1:05:38] what where we're at
[1:05:41] what is God God is a great Eternal at
[1:05:43] the beginning way back before there was
[1:05:45] a beginning he wasn't even God did you
[1:05:47] know that God is an object of worship
[1:05:49] and there wasn't nothing to worship him
[1:05:50] he lived alone and in him was attributes
[1:05:53] what is an attribute of thought
[1:05:56] what is an attribute adult
[1:06:00] all right
[1:06:02] so we're getting to the attributes of
[1:06:04] God
[1:06:05] to be savior healer
[1:06:08] Etc
[1:06:09] so we had to permit something to be lost
[1:06:12] he had to permit something to be sick
[1:06:17] so he could just play
[1:06:19] his abilities
[1:06:21] of what he already wanted
[1:06:23] before the world
[1:06:24] all right which we say but but now but I
[1:06:28] I it's not my fault
[1:06:34] you're a free moral agent
[1:06:37] it's your choice right now
[1:06:41] you can change right now
[1:06:45] or you can go on with your own carnal
[1:06:48] thinking
[1:06:51] right
[1:06:56] look at the next one number five
[1:06:59] take them from marriage and divorce I
[1:07:00] wish you'd listen to the or read
[1:07:01] the whole message
[1:07:03] paragraph 101 why did notice why did she
[1:07:09] do such a thing
[1:07:11] being in that high order
[1:07:13] now look
[1:07:15] she was right with man
[1:07:18] co-equal with him
[1:07:20] right now that ain't much of a byproduct
[1:07:23] you just buy it I hate people that make
[1:07:26] jokes out of the Bible
[1:07:28] you get the preacher you get in the
[1:07:30] pulpit and you say that woman's a
[1:07:31] byproduct said she'll buy everything she
[1:07:33] can and everybody just laughs I don't
[1:07:36] laugh
[1:07:37] because that's making a joke of the
[1:07:39] Bible
[1:07:42] that's not what it's talking about it
[1:07:44] she's a byproduct
[1:07:49] well answer for them kind of jokes
[1:07:53] she was right with me in coika with him
[1:07:56] but we all know that she lost her Co
[1:07:58] week Oneness with man when she sinned
[1:08:01] and God said man will be your ruler from
[1:08:03] here on and that's a scripture if you
[1:08:05] want to we could read it and give you
[1:08:06] the scripture in the time to hook it up
[1:08:08] notice uh she did that how did Satan
[1:08:11] never get to her did you know Satan was
[1:08:13] co-equal with God one day
[1:08:17] sure was I'll be the Creator
[1:08:21] Satan was cruel equal God over the
[1:08:24] Creator he just couldn't create
[1:08:26] he was everything stood at his right
[1:08:28] hand of God in the heavens a great
[1:08:29] leading cherub notice the reason she did
[1:08:32] this she was not in the original
[1:08:34] creation
[1:08:36] she is not in God's original creation
[1:08:39] she's a byproduct therefore at the
[1:08:41] beginning as Jesus referred to she was
[1:08:44] not original create not original
[1:08:48] creative being of God she's a byproduct
[1:08:51] of a man when Jesus referred to the
[1:08:53] beginning
[1:08:54] now that's what I'm wanting to do
[1:08:57] the
[1:08:58] because I know I think a little bit
[1:09:00] different than what most people think
[1:09:02] and most people think well boy one of
[1:09:04] these days we're going to get there and
[1:09:06] there's going to be Jesus and there's
[1:09:07] going to be us and that's wonderful
[1:09:09] but you know what
[1:09:11] I want to think about getting there and
[1:09:13] he's in here
[1:09:15] I don't want him just standing over
[1:09:17] there
[1:09:18] that's the perusias the doctrine to the
[1:09:20] people of the message
[1:09:23] I want him in here
[1:09:27] right
[1:09:29] all right
[1:09:31] remember now what notice what a
[1:09:35] byproduct
[1:09:36] and notice the only one of God's
[1:09:38] creation of every animal anything else
[1:09:41] she was the only one designed this way
[1:09:45] all right every other female was in the
[1:09:47] original creation every other female was
[1:09:49] an original Christian but Eve was not in
[1:09:51] the original Christ so he had to be so
[1:09:54] that had to be made that way we'll get
[1:09:57] to it after a while and notice in the
[1:09:59] creation that she was in not in the
[1:10:02] original creation but a byproduct
[1:10:05] in this creation
[1:10:07] now a byproduct a creation
[1:10:12] you just think how that if it should
[1:10:14] have stayed
[1:10:15] in that original
[1:10:18] there would have been no sin
[1:10:20] all right
[1:10:22] but there would have been no display as
[1:10:24] a savior A Healer and things
[1:10:27] so what happened in the garden was to
[1:10:29] bring out
[1:10:30] you know into the right one look at his
[1:10:32] next one we'll have to quit on this one
[1:10:34] number six which is Revelations chapter
[1:10:36] 5.
[1:10:39] paragraph 86.
[1:10:41] that's his plan that's the way he did it
[1:10:43] God knowing that man would fall
[1:10:46] yet he could not make man fall knowing
[1:10:49] man would be lost though he did not want
[1:10:52] anybody lost
[1:10:54] but to order that the great display of
[1:10:57] the attributes of God might be manifest
[1:10:59] in all man that he could be a redeemer
[1:11:01] he could be a savior man had to fall it
[1:11:04] was in him to fall what
[1:11:07] then it was in God to redeem him again
[1:11:10] that's the we have to have not time to
[1:11:14] make a display Pros in the cons right
[1:11:19] are you following me and we'll quit on
[1:11:21] that
[1:11:23] we'll take up the attributes part
[1:11:26] later and see what
[1:11:28] going with it
[1:11:31] you might be surprised this afternoon
[1:11:33] we've got a little surprise
[1:11:36] and we're not going to tell you what it
[1:11:38] is until this afternoon
[1:11:42] okay
[1:11:45] but listen
[1:11:47] do you understand just a minute come on
[1:11:50] musicians
[1:11:51] do you understand
[1:11:56] that when God in the beginning
[1:11:59] he did not make
[1:12:02] Eve wrong
[1:12:04] he made her perfect beautiful
[1:12:10] standing right there with Adam that she
[1:12:13] came out of his side
[1:12:15] and her problem was work she's tried to
[1:12:17] find another side to stand with
[1:12:20] right
[1:12:22] the Beast deceived her into doing what
[1:12:25] she done
[1:12:26] and when she did he brought the whole
[1:12:28] human race
[1:12:31] into sin
[1:12:34] but that question I asked you
[1:12:38] does polygamy do away with sin
[1:12:45] is it that
[1:12:47] God said to Eve look you messed up and
[1:12:51] had two partners I'm gonna make it over
[1:12:53] here for Adam where he can have all he
[1:12:56] wants
[1:12:57] to make you mad and all stirred up
[1:13:02] because from now on
[1:13:04] you'll only have one
[1:13:07] and if you get more than one
[1:13:10] amen you're an adulteress
[1:13:14] now remember I gave you scriptures
[1:13:17] if her husband be dead
[1:13:19] she's free to marry
[1:13:23] all right
[1:13:25] see so if a man's wife is dead he's free
[1:13:29] to marry
[1:13:30] when was her husband is dead she's free
[1:13:32] to marry only in the Lord
[1:13:38] which means according
[1:13:41] to the rest of the word of God is that
[1:13:43] right so he can go out and just grab any
[1:13:46] woman and say I want this woman that's
[1:13:48] mine
[1:13:50] I know she's been a prostitute before
[1:13:52] she deferred to prostitute
[1:13:54] I want her no
[1:13:57] well the Bible says I can put my wife
[1:13:59] away and marry again
[1:14:01] you got stipulations about
[1:14:04] getting married again
[1:14:07] it's not just the hardness of your heart
[1:14:10] that they put them away for anything
[1:14:12] they wanted to
[1:14:18] be in the Bible
[1:14:21] Jesus said except it be for fornication
[1:14:31] you see we went and married and we've
[1:14:32] done these things on our own
[1:14:36] we wasn't worried about what God says
[1:14:38] and that's what Terrence says about it
[1:14:40] and my point is you married the first
[1:14:42] time because of sex desires and lusts
[1:14:45] everybody know it was love
[1:14:48] it was love
[1:14:50] the second time I might have a little
[1:14:51] love to do with it but the first time I
[1:14:53] was just playing out old sex
[1:14:56] I loved him when I first seen him
[1:15:00] but I loved him when I first seen him
[1:15:03] you know
[1:15:04] I mean
[1:15:05] it was love at first sight
[1:15:09] no it was love at first dog
[1:15:12] you got to think before you can have any
[1:15:14] desire
[1:15:16] just be honest with me I try to be
[1:15:19] honest with you
[1:15:22] so then my saying is what first time you
[1:15:24] married for sex second time you married
[1:15:26] for money
[1:15:31] that's
[1:15:33] about right true
[1:15:37] what you see Church
[1:15:40] in the garden
[1:15:42] polygamy never done away with sin
[1:15:46] I ask you again though
[1:15:49] because we're going to keep on that dog
[1:15:53] you can say all you want to about it was
[1:15:55] permitted
[1:15:56] to top Christ in the church
[1:15:59] I'm still going to ask you the same
[1:16:01] question
[1:16:03] what does polygamy got to do with it
[1:16:05] today
[1:16:17] we're still typing Christ in the church
[1:16:24] right
[1:16:27] then you might figure out why it says
[1:16:30] he can but she can't
[1:16:35] that's today
[1:16:38] when we get all that figured out then
[1:16:40] you'll come up with understanding
[1:16:42] hey this thing is a beautiful story
[1:16:48] and God has really worked out his plan
[1:16:51] and purpose
[1:16:55] and come forth with a wife
[1:16:58] that can be one with him
[1:17:01] which you'll be a many-membered body
[1:17:08] go to the right scripture let's stand
