at the motel uh Friday night there will be sandwiches it'll be light meal but we're going to have a lot of fellowship at that Park and you got all this if you need it get it in the back the itinerary Saturday we'll start at 10:00 and then we have a church service at 6 there'll be a meal provided while we're at uh we're going to become methodists for a day at the United Methodist Church I hope they

cash or check only all right the meal is the meal is $20 each plus tax plus tip all right so it's going to be right about $30 cuz you're all going to tip 20% right that's what I thought so anyway so that'd be $24 and then4 more dollars for tax so about figure up about $30 for the meal so the meal is going to be 30 bucks a piece and you'll be required you know you you're paying that so um just

that just just pray that everything goes well pray the Brother D was able to come because they really want to see him he's he's uh he's important he's important to all them up there too I mean he's his ministry helped them way years and years and years ago before anything before you know before we were a big church here they were they were probably a bigger bigger Church in Tennessee when brother Woodby and then was there and Dad brother Woodby were good friends and then him and brother Richard Wilson good friends and they've learned a lot from each other and and and we glean that as as the congregation we gleaned from that when Brother D ministered that that they had all that support they they could talk and fellowship back in the late 70s early ' 80s and into of the '90s brother calling them used to go brother Dy used to go ministers meetings up there um every month they'd have a ministers meeting either there or here so we really appreciate them let's stand to our feet and let's get into the service just remember all these announcements if you need that itinerary it's right back there on on the right sitting on that shelf and if you're if if you're if you're uh if your itinerary changes you need to let us know cuz we got a block of rooms and I don't want to have pay for a room cuz the church is paying for all the rooms so um I don't want a room to set empty if we don't need it and she's already called wanting us to to get some KingSize Beds which will be for the couples which is fine don't worry we already got that taken care of but she's wanting to readjust because we took up 15 double bed double bed rooms so she was needing a few double beds so anyway we're going to work that out we'll have plenty of room for everybody to stay Friday night and Saturday night we know a lot of you are coming Saturday uh if you are coming Saturday please try to get there you know at least by for the service time all right at 6:00 I know it's going to be tough for some brother Lis and then we're going to be a little bit late but at least we're going to get together we'll be there and then everybody will be there on Sunday and we should have a good time in the Lord amen I love Fellowship I'm a sheep I need a I'm a herd animal I need people around me I ain't no loner I like people and uh and uh we pray that after I get finished with this what I'm fixing to say today I hope you like me too cuz we're going to talk about brotherly kindness but we going to get into some eye openers all right but that's what we need now listen before we go we're not going any further without brotherly kindness we're not going any further we're not you can talk head stone you can talk Seven Seals you can talk bringing Christ back to the Earth you can talk about Rapture you can talk about Resurrection but if you don't have brotherly kindness ain't going to happen are you going to go by the grave one of the two all right so let's go to the Lord and prayer Lord thank you for all these things you give us you give us an opportunity to have a a congregation that's that's big enough Lord so that we can go do things and help other small churches and fellowship with them where maybe they can't fellowship with anyone else that we can come in and fellowship with them and and fellowship around you uh there'll be a lot of of um a fellowship of getting back together of of of back when and and all that but Lord I pray that you be the center of everything that we do you be the one and that's the only reason we're Gathering because we're gathering around this message and we're gathering around another group of people another group of family members brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus now we pray that you'd be with them up there be with those sisters and brothers brother Andre too as they prepare and get the food ready and and get all the things together we know what a a task that is Lord from doing things here we appreciate the people here too Lord that helped last weekend and the different ones that help all the time um doing things getting stuff ready because we want to be servants we want to serve the people we want the people to feel comfortable the only person we want uncomfortable today is the devil amen and Lord I pray that through the preaching of your word that we'll hear from you Lord give us the isav Lord to put on our eyes and Lord give us ears to hear father I pray that you'd bless us be with the ones that are sick be brother Dale sister Dale different ones Lord that's not here today that so desires to be set in this congregation again Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that your healing power will go to each one and give them strength to get back in Church Father we pray that you'd be with us Lord further in this service in Jesus name amen am in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth Philippians 2:3 says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other that's hard to do I'm just going to tell you up front hard to do because of all the selfishness that we have but in the loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing cuz remember what did Abraham do even without the baptism of the Holy Ghost Abraham had an anointing from the Old Testament and even under that anointing he said okay lot we're standing here together we're looking at Plains of mammory which is green as as all get out and they're Sodom and Gomorrah you've already got two cities over there and then over here is a desert Abraham bless God I'm in the message I know the prophet that's mine you can take what's left over now what Abraham what ABR Abraham do he said lot whichever one you want that's right lot took that one Abra Abraham said not a problem I'll take this one but now who did God bless blessed Abraham all right he'll take a he'll take something that we think sometimes is a curse and make a blessing out of it all right good to have brother George back with us his sister passed away last week suddenly and we sure we're praying for you and appreciate the phone call anything we can do you you know you let us know but good to have him back with us today second Peter 1 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge the knowledge Temperance Temperance patience the patience Godly and godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity so all these are ads we're adding these to our Christian experience it says what after in other words besides this what besides your new birth we're going to get into this when we get to the to the part where it says holy spirit because when it seals you in like that you come under an anointing called adoption or this is where your adoption or your placing is that is not your new birth you can be born again and not be adopted but you can't get be adopted and not be born again all right just like we were talking about being saved you can be saved and not be born again all right but you can't be born again and not have come to Salvation everybody with me on that all right so we are looking at now an add to we're looking at an addition to your Christian Journey this is what we need to do to become what brother Rams calls us a Powerhouse we want to be a Powerhouse we don't want to come to just church to I didn't just come to church today to get a to get a firecracker right uhuh I come for TNT I come for dunamus which is where you get the word Dynamite from I want to come with that today and get that and take it with me and blow the devil up with it all right we get so happy sometimes with the devil well I'm want to preach anyway all right well if y'all don't just pray for me all right Colossians 1:26 says though there's a mystery that mystery in the end time is what Christ in you the hope of glory and the fullness of the son of man in a group of people not in one in a group of people that takes this message and makes it come alive as Christ was alive back in 2,000 years ago that's my goal is to see every one of us you me included be something that God can use we have been used by the devil long enough amen I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I'm sick and tired of the devil taking over and having his way all right but what do we do we need to get in the word you don't have to go you don't have to go do hail mares and you know don't no just get back in the word of God which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man teaching every man all wisdom that we may present every man perfect are complete in Christ that's what we're heading for amen and then we talked about the I'm trying to background for some that weren't here last week there was a holy spirit Veil put on Adam and Eve all right they had a holy ghost Veil on their eyes that they were naked and didn't know it all right but they were not perverted that's right am I just preaching to myself today can somebody either nod a little louder or say Amen okay there was a holy spirit Veil over them for their nakedness now the Holy Spirit brother R said was over their eyes they seen nothing but their brother and sister see all right the laws they didn't know they were naked they had the Holy Spirit Veil they didn't they didn't um uh they didn't worry about that what we have to worry about putting on clothes all right they didn't have to worry about that but now brother Brown said the spirit of unholiness uncleanness and lust has veiled this scientific age and Revelations three tells us that they're naked and don't know it amen but in a lustful way not in the way God wants it to be cuz even now we're we've come to a place to where we're going to have white robes we're not going to walk naked in the in the uh future home we're going to have white robes on all right brother R saw them in white robes right amen so brother uh this is my quote we we're putting the veil back on by the revealed word God has given us a veil to where we don't we we don't do this I mean sometimes we shockingly do that for what they don't have on or whatever more but it's not it's not a lust Veil that we're under I hope I hope we kind of got away from that a little bit all right so if a veil is being put back on by the word of God and by these virtues the word of God Is veiling Us from from the outside but unveiling God inside of us amen all right brother Brown preached the unveiling of God now where was he unveiling God at in people that's right not in a church not in a message not in a a car or or whatever you want to say or a tape recorder it was in the people he knew there'd be a people and the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound now if the mystery is going to be finished or the mystery is going to be known it's got to be known to you yes it's got to be known to a human being that's right all right it can't be known to the animals they didn't fall that's right we fell amen they fell because we fell now we're trying to get us back so that they can come back and they won't be eating each other and they won't be a food chain in the in the uh in the out in the woods where one eats the other one and this one eats that one but you know what we're going to do we're going to do the same thing cuz you know what I'm going read you here in just a minute all that Spirit of selfishness and critical spirit that makes you eat people and you get eat up with it yeah brother Brandon got eat up with it that ought to wake you up I'm going to read you a quote he even said he had a critical spirit I've been reading the one where he said he had a selfish Spirit brother brandom well what are you trying to say he was human and he made human mistakes but when God anointed his lips to talk to me and you that was God Almighty talking to us amen Genesis 1:26 say let us make man in our image and after our likeness so what did God do he took this as brother Ryan is talking about love he took this agape love because that's what God is he's AG go love he is not FAL love he allowed FAL love to come into being because of me and you because of the Fall he said okay husband you'll love your wife yeah right yeah before all that it was Agape it was perfect love all right this Genesis 126 man is agape love not FAL love you didn't come here yeah you came here with FAL love or the other ones on down a little bit further but by the new birth it put the agape love back inside of you yes sir right or inside of you by the new birth you became born in another image amen everybody with me all right if you not been born in another image you need to look at yourself if you look at yourself and see yourself different you have been born in another image but if you look at yourself and say I still do the same things I used to do you need to get born again you need the new birth let us make man in our image so if we were made in the image of God God's AG gape love right so we were made in ag gape love God brought a family into being through agape love all right we have to bring family in being by FAL love are all the other ones down through the line lust and all that other stuff but God doesn't do that he allows that to happen to get you here because in Genesis 3 he said I'll put imity in other words I got to divide this up I can't stand to see sin anymore I got to have a blood covering and that blood covering covered Adam and Eve and then it covered all the way down through all right even would have covered Cain if he would have accepted it right all right so God created man his own image so that image of God is there in stone it can't be changed that's right now we can come down here on the other side of the fall and as Brother randam Talks in the Masterpiece and we'll read it just a second but in the image of God created him male and female created them so he set up brothers and sisters us brothers and sisters all right but children of God is what come forth from God agape love remember brother Ry went across a the current of time what do he tell what the people they said he said what is this he said the angel said oh this is perfect what perfect love that's agape love that over there is not filo love he could hug the sisters they could say my precious brother and put their arm around him there no be be no feeling he said all right so that was what we came from praise the Lord and that's what we're going back to amen but we got to have part of it right here yes sir cuz if you've got that Genesis 126 man and of you you have aape love inside that's the war the war if you break the war down it's the two loves that's right that's right it's aape love which is the love of Jesus Christ which is your new birth it is perfect and then you got you that was born in the other one that's the two ones that are fighting each other all right and listen if you don't have the new birth there's no fight you just you just feel your love that's it I love this I love that you know I love this now the love of God I said before the love of God sometimes is strange it feels strange to us because the world wants to see that Jesus was the prince of peace right he said I'm the Prince of Peace he had a pretty tumultous life right he got mad angry uh he called the religious world the devil snakes vipers father of the devil right and I don't think he said it real calmly under his breath why he got a little frustrated because he was a human man right that's right but inside of him though was the agape love cuz that's what took him to Calvary F your love will not take you to Calvary agape love is the only thing it'll take you to your Calvary cuz we all got to be right crucified with Christ is what Paul said all right so he created in his own image but when that image came it became marred but now brother brandom we look at it as as oh man it's ruined it's marred not in God that's right cuz brother Brown I'm going to read here in just a few minutes brother Brown said that stroke that marred the statue it brought out the bride as a masterpiece family the mark on the knee of the Moses statue made it special yeah right it was the stroke that cut the side of his M this his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see them as a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it pleased him he took a rest he said I'll rest but while he was resting and trusting his Masterpiece his enemy came in and found this Great Masterpiece and by deceit he crawls under the Garden of Eden and and marred this beautiful Masterpiece he marred it so it fell but now in the fall all hope was not lost in the fall what was the whole deal God was able to now get into man more now remember we talked about Moses David Samson all of them had power but they didn't have character all right if Moses have been born again like brother Donnie sting here he would have not killed an an Egyptian he would have not done the things he did right but he had power from God because he was chosen to do with the anointing and we're going to get into that maybe in a couple of sermons and probably do it at at at brother Andre's is talk about an anointing for the time there's an anointing for the time now listen a new birth is not an anointing the new birth is your birth it's a person it's something that sticks to you praise God and it's Eternal but now you can have an anointing that's not Eternal that's right amen anointing was at the end time you can people can be anointed to write songs people in this message anointed to write songs and be laying in the bed of adultery during what time they're doing it yeah that's power without character cuz they yield theirself to what an anointing they yield theirself the world Listen today you're Anointed with something yes you're either anointed to preach you're anointed to listen you're anointed to be a deacon you're anointed to be a a wonderful wife or a husband that's an anoint that see that comes uh uh regardless of your new birth brother John didn't become a husband now he might become a good one when he got born again but sister Alicia no don't don't shake your head neither neither way just leave it at that now he was a good husband I'm sure but but now that he's born again he's a wonderful husband see what I'm talking about so you always have that anointing of what you were remember brother R said remember you born a prophet but now remember that you got to be careful cuz brother Brandon remember he had to be born again he wasn't he didn't say that that anointing birthed you it just anointed you right brother brandham had the new birth now we can agree everybody in this building brother brandham was born again amen right but why did he stand in the pull pit and he say I'm waiting on him waiting on who I thought he had the who inside of him he was waiting on a special anointing he was waiting on his Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 he was waiting on that anointing to come behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet well God sent him but he had to anoint him to do the things he did all right because you and I have the same New Birth that that brother Ram had or God's different amen he's not different but he comes with different anointings at different levels Jesus stood one day opened the book and he said in other words I've been anointed look on the River Jordan I'm preaching my sermon for next Sunday look on the River Jordan now he didn't need the Holy Ghost everybody with me he didn't need the Holy Ghost he was God he was the Holy Ghost whatever that spirit inside of him was not the spirit of a moral man that's right or a normal human being amen so what came on him at the River Jordan he didn't get the Holy Ghost like me and you get it he got an anointing to send him forward into his ministry all right because he proved that in the Book of Luke he said I've been anointed to preach the gospel to bring good Tiding and remember he stopped that's why did he stop that wasn't time for that anointing the time for the anointing is over here now when he's going to destroy the world and when he's going to judge the world Amen so anyway so that's kind of where if you look at that anointing you can see even even these are are anointings right cuz it's not your birth your birth is down here yes then you add to you're anointed to these different things and I I'll prove it to you a little bit cuz I want to read a couple of quotes I know we got started late I won't do very much this morning but we'll get to it this afternoon but Moses had power without character David look at David a man after God's Own heart listen a man that that that God said my heart beats with David's heart that's what he said a man after my own heart now we're going to look at David and call him a murderer a liar an adulterer premeditated murder he would have got life sentence or either he'd have got electrocuted if he'd have been in this end been in the end time cuz he premeditated that it wasn't just he got mad and struck him no he mapped the whole thing out and brought his best General besides urri and said um withdraw him you know withdraw leave him out there well that man knew too but he wasn't going to go against the king that's right that wasn't a new birth no that's right Samson Abraham Jacob Noah Saul Elisha all these different ones they had flaws but now we we all right now they had flaws right we're not putting them down because watch this 1 Corinthians 10 ver1 says moreover Brethren I will not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud now this is Paul talking about the Jews in the wilderness everybody with me all right I feel like I'm preaching to nobody today all right so somebody either say Amen or I'm going to preach it anyway I I'm going to preach till 11:45 so y'all just sit there and pay attention or just sit there all passed through the sea all were baptized in unto Moses in the cloud in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat in other words they weren't Gentiles they weren't worldly people they were in the message of the hour let's say Amen they were following the message of the hour they were following the prophet of the hour they were following the anointing of the hour is everybody with me and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of the rock that followed them and that rock was Christ kind of a strange rock you know you get up in the morning the Rocks there you go two or three miles you get up the next morning the Rocks there flowing with water uh watering two me people yeah and horses and camels and all that other stuff all right but with many of them God was not well pleased how about that today for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples so Moses was our example Abraham how many sermons have you heard Moses name mentioned how many sermons have you heard Abraham boy now Abraham what if you took all the them out of the Bible took them take them all out Noah oh that was a flood I don't know how anybody got across yeah we do Noah did cuz God anointed Noah to build an ark so these things are our example to the intent we should not lust after those evil things they lusted after in other words I don't want to paraphrase but that's kind of what he was saying as they also lusted all right neither be ye idolators as were some of them as is written the people set down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 23,000 people God killed in one day out of the children of Israel because they committed fornication amen neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed by serpents neither murmur you murmur try that sometime quit murmuring right as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happened unto them for in Sample our examples and they were written for our admonition in other words so we can preach brother John we can teach about these people and say look we know David was a man after God's Own Heart he wrote the Psalms and he wrote these different things and and God loved him but he had a flaw but the flaw to me made Masterpiece amen that's what me and somebody else were talking the other day now David great David right everybody with me David great David David God thought so much of David he said your throne's going to be forever somebody's going to sit on your throne he said I'm going to sit on your throne as the son of David through the Millennium that's how much I thank of you David right now what was David's daddy's name Jesse right right he comes and he tells Samuel here's all my kids you know this and and got you know got them lined up Samuel says None of these what I can't get the anointing to fall on none of these right he walks up to one not you brother call but he walks up to the eldest Samuel standing there with the anointing on him to anoint a king amen all right nothing happens kind of like what some of y'all are doing now nothing's happening so you go to number two go to number three nothing four five six wow something's going on God sent me here right I'm a prophet of God God sent me here he said go anoint a king go to Jesse's house and anoint a king right so he takes the oil doesn't ring out doesn't ring a bell he says is there something going on what's my whole point we talk about David we talk about his brothers we talk about his daddy Jesse but David had a mama amen right David had a mama that you'll never know until we get on the other side who she is but she was very intrical because David remember was the baby he was mama's boy and his mama taught him well you said oh no no no well wait a minute let's go with Jacob look at all the mothers in the Bible that have helped their kids but you never heard of David's mama what he trying to say you your man your name may never be called from the pull pit your M name may never be called in the Bible or in a sermon but I'll promise you you are worth something you all have an anointing for a job that to do whether you just raise kids whether you teach Sunday school whether you whether you go and work and and Shine Your Light somewhere David had a mama now listen we we we got to know David had a mama but you never heard of her but she had to be an intrical part she kept those kids together and she made a house good enough to where God sent Samuel the prophet to that house to anoint a king right he just didn't know it was David he thought you know the big tall one the eldest no it was a little boy that was out in the field watching sheep but they were given for our example so now that's that's an example for us that we as Christians and we talk about brotherly kindness listen brotherly slash sisterly kindness it ain't just on the brothers we sisters we sisters I'm talking about we sisters need to do it too that wasn't funny at least you laugh amen and laugh let's see if we can get those two together so example our example means a pattern look watch this what did we just talk about the stroke that marred the Masterpiece right that word in Sample means a stroke or a blow so all these were struck somehow in their life for me and you listen we will always have these great ones in the Old Testament we will always have their name called cuz they're going to be the pillars over there of that new city remember 12 Patriarchs 12 Apostles right not going to forget them they're going to be there the tribes all the 12 tribes you know what they're named after people right that's right a figure formed by a blow or an impression in other words Abraham made an impression on us cuz we talk about him giving his his wife away twice laughing at God David killing his best friend Jacob Jacob just he if he went to to Las Vegas he'd be the biggest Gambler there was cuz he deceived everything and everybody that he touched or came into contact with all right until he came in contact with God he spent one night with God and he wrestled with him maybe we ought to do that sometime and wrestle with God and walk different because remember God struck him on the thigh and he became a limping Prince well now his name changed to Israel and everybody knew that there was something different about Jacob well that's the same way about your new birth do you walk different than what you did before all right the teaching which embodies the sum and sub of religion and represents it to the Mind manner of writing and content form of a letter in other words we look back at the Old Testament to see these examples that's right all right which is I'm getting to something here because Jesus stood one day and he said I give you a new commandment right I I you know don't do away with that remember he he became the law he came under the law he made it Honorable in other words he made it where we could live it that's right cuz they couldn't live it in the Old Testament they didn't they didn't have anything to live it with cuz they would have an anointing that would anoint Moses to where you couldn't even look at him his face shines so much with God God's presence and then you could go kill an Egyptian and and strike the rock instead of speaking to it disobeying God Amen all right it's a pattern of warning of ruinous events which serve as admonitions or warning to others that's what we look back to but Jesus stood and he look or things prefigure the future Messianic person which is Jesus Christ he's standing there saying a new commandment he said you're living the best you can what did he tell the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler said I've lived all 10 did he not say that I've lived all Ten Commandments from my youth right you can't condemn me of not living the Ten Commandments Jesus said okay you got to do one more thing that's right you got to sell all and become me amen ain't that what he was telling them he didn't say now sell all and become your neighbor come on somebody sell all and go back to your daddy now he had a daddy Mama too right he said sell all take up your cross and follow me what cross did that come from it come from that yes that was a cross that that Jesus bore amen everybody with me on that think about that he was telling the Rich Young Ruler hey you got to be me yes you've done all this that law is good that's letter you you passed the letter test but if you passed the spiritual test have you passed the virtue test that's right remember he didn't uh he knew the message in about every quote right the Commandments right don't do this do that wear your dresses long don't cut your hair come to church y but he never became Jesus Christ amen he couldn't go that far he was selfish that's what we're going to get into because brotherly kindness you have to do away with selfishness all right so let's read this real quick besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue The Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and your brotherly kindness charity now remember brotherly kindness or let's say brotherly SLS sisterly charity or or kindness comes from the word Philadelphia which is two words and we'll read it in a minute but it literally means to love your brother all right love of the brothers or sisters in the New Testament look he didn't say any old there was no love there was know agape love now listen God would come down as Jehovah and would anoint people because of agape love but he couldn't put that agape love inside of the people in the Old Testament cuz he hadn't come and release the life yet all right which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren now remember that we were talking about this last Sunday there's an inward work of virtue knowledge Temperance and patience that's something you got to do an upward of being more like God and then your outward appearance is your brotherly kindness and love you can hide a lot of things but I'll promise you I'm fixing to read something here in just a minute and I hope I want the cameras turned on your face I'm warning you oh now y'all going to be but what about inside don't be like Jesus said Dead Man's Bones right outward faith that others can see it cannot be hidden I'll promise you you can never hide your anger your faith face will betray you right amen all right all right so this is the compound word involving felio which is love and adelphus which is brother literally means love of the brother now listen to brother bradam it comes from agape love to filo love to lust down this way now what happened with was Jesus came and plopped himself down here in this earth and worked his way back the other way with us with him yes right he came here with us in him amen and he went back to heaven with us in him yes sir but he didn't keep it he came back on the day of Pentecost sent it back down the love of God he sent it back to 120 and put it in them and that's what he's been doing since 20 years ago all right he's been putting agape love back into his children and as we said before remember when you say God bless you brother you are denoting that that person is in your family come on you're connected by family that's my brother that's my sister all right do we really mean that all right brother I'm talks about putting yourself in this place I got to hurry right here to get to this have patience with him now watch this right here everybody ready for this so hanging around down there and the first thing you know one night came up a question about church so we always get in trouble and about Christians one of the old drunks sitting there said there ain't no such thing as Christians anymore said there's no such a thing all this bunch of Hypocrites now this is questions and answers 1964 all this bunch of Hypocrites did you see them out here smoking drinking doing the same things that we do and we see that today and said call themselves Christians there's no such this one drunk raised up and said just a minute there's one that I know about that who is it say it's my wife y'all ready for this say she's become salty he was catching it all the time he said I bet if she was put to a squeeze we're going to be put to a squeeze right remember we're the wife of Jesus Christ right he said no she's still a Christian I'll prove it to you and I know what most of you sisters are going to when I get finished reading this paragraph you're going to say scoundrel kick him out of the house and I'll divorce him I see it in your face already cuz some of you know this story said I'll tell you what Let's do let's go up home and I'll show you whether she's a Christian or not said let's go up home and now let's really be drunk in other words we're going to pretend like we're really drunk knocked at the door came in staggering over everything boy right there y'all already mad stumbling over everything thing why don't you sit around this way and everything and she set them all on a chair and they talking about his wife uh uh his guest you know and tried to make them just as welcome as could be they were pretending they were drunk how many of us would already kicked them out tried to make them as comfortable and welcome as could be said I want you to fix us some supper all right y'all just hold your temper down all right bless God go fix it yourself you're drunk go fix it yourself you done fell over the chair and knocked over the uh flower pot do it yourself I'm reading what brother brandom tells us okay I'm just telling you these are for our example right I want you to fix us some supper and so they she went out and fix some said we want ham and eggs he know they had it so they fixed the ham and eggs she did when he got there at the table he looked at them like that picked up his plate easy sisters and Slamm the stuff on the floor and said you know I don't like my eggs like that I can feel it already come on boy let's get out of here anyway like that they went out and sat down like that you know she didn't go back in the bedroom and start pouting hello somebody she didn't take her emotions and let them override and she go sit in the closet and cry her eyes out she might have been crying but she came outside and said what can I do I'm sorry I didn't I I didn't get them fixed I'll fix more for you knocks a lot of us out right there doesn't it yeah I see you wild eyes oh nonsense you know I didn't want them that way in the first place now he's still oner just carrying on like that they went out there and sat down and acted like they was drunk they heard her in there kind of snubbing to herself singing real low must Jesus by the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me this consecrated cross I'll bear Till Death Shall Set Me Free one drunk looked at the other one said she's a Christian she's got it and that little woman led her husband plus these others to Christ that night see why see just be real sweet you believe that story I mean brother Brown he's a liar If he if that's not a story that he told that he knew somebody had told him about right he may not have been part of it but he sure he's a wonderful Storyteller and he weaves it into his sermon she's a Christian and that little woman led her husband plus these others to Christ that night she didn't have to C she have to call the pastor right she didn't have to call the preacher she didn't have to put on a tape she had it in her and they saw it in her right how many of us could have passed that test don't raise your hand cuz I know none of us maybe one or two John 13:34 listen that's an example of a Christian that's right brother you can say well that's farfetched and you're using a I'm telling you what the prophet said if he put it in here and weaved it into his sermon guess who it's for wasn't for the world it's for you yes sir and me I'll clap myself he gave it to us God thought enough of us to help us get out of that yes by telling us that story and say man I have really messed up John 13:34 says a new commandment now here's Jesus standing he's he's giv him a new commandment that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another look by this shall all men know that that woman was a Christian right if you have love one for the other but this shall all men know that you are my disciples in other words an outward display if you have love one to the other remember disciples means discipline those disciples were disciplined to what Jesus said all right but it is an outward display Proverbs 25:21 says if thine en be enemy be hungry J bless God he make it for yourself he's the one that made the mistake it's not what the Bible says that's right if he be thirsty give him water to drink for Thou shalt Heap coals of fire on his head and the Lord shall reward you amen what I tell y'all last Sunday or Sunday before last you know how to stop an argument don't respond that's right amen you know what creates an argument you responding that's right listen now I have I have argued with myself a few times but I didn't get anywhere with it but now I've argued with other people and really messed up bad how many of y'all had have argued with someone and and felt better about it when you argue you always feel worse always always see I told you glad we brought supper I mean lunch today y'all not going to give me anything to eat K some cookies oh thank you Michael Michael gives cookies to his people to come to his Sunday school class Ryan and Bob don't just saying the Lord is well pleased give you to laugh a little bit cuz there's a there's a black fog in here he will he will magnify the law make it honorable so God God in flesh stood one day and said hey I am the Commandments that's right but I'm going to give you this new one live it like I live it because remember the Pharisees even live The Ten Commandments but they had in their heart Mischief they had in their heart that they didn't like what was going on so God come to magnify the lawmaker honorable he did not come to do away with it cuz he kept telling him a new commandment I give you now remember the old commandment was and we'll close right here the old commandment was if Michael killed Terrence I went after Michael and I was I was totally under the law of the levitical law to kill him I mean murder him take him out and cut his head off and God did not hold that against me in the Old Testament all right eye for an eye tooth for a tooth life for a life ain't that right right if you caught were caught in the act of adultery you were put in you were you were killed the person you and the person uh there was one instance where that they brought an idol in and remember God brought the man and the woman in the tent and whoever it was Phineas or one of them took a sword and stuck it through both of them and killed them both they were honorable to do that that's right but Jesus if he come to magnify the law now he's telling us we can kill people amen without touching them amen let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you I'm not doing away with that I'm just telling you what agape love will do if you'll put it in this law amen there was nothing that was it was fil Your Love down here because it was down here for the people God always was a god love but there was no way he could connect them sin was so bad I was thinking yesterday even being Christians and being as much godliness as we are we're dying amen as much holy as much as you know we come to church and and you see people like died in different ones in the 80s and that's just a sin curse there's nothing you can do about it there is but I'm telling you when brother Bown told Bill da he said I'll see you again I'll shake your hand at the Tabernacle or wherever it was now whatever was H wrong with Brother Bill da cancer or whatever it was yeah God took that away but it didn't make him 18 right amen he still had a hard time probably getting out of the car and he shook brother R's hand like this cuz he was 92 right that's how bad the sin curse is but God has give us a message yes sir that if we'll live it amen come on somebody that's our anointing that's our anointing is to take that and destroy that destroy the works of Satan destroy the works of death cuz where did Death start start in the garden amen but I say unto you that you resist not evil whosoever shall smack thee on the cheek give him the other one right oh yeah I'll give him another one all right give him another five ain't that what we' do if a man shall Sue thee at the law hey if he wants your car give him a house how many of us already failed all right every one of you that's right cuz a lot of y'all in your heart you said I ain't going to do that amen amen amen that's what I thought and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go too give him that asked from me that would borrow and turn him not away you have heard it said that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy now that's what they've heard from the priest with the Torah in the Old Testament that's what God Said to the people the Torah was a word of God to the people that's what they preach from all right uh Moses's quotebook but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you right do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven I'm going to stop right there because I want you I want to ask you a question musicians come on I want to ask you a

you know brother rown didn't say that I'm going to read it to you brother Brown said I was just critical in my heart that's right that's right nobody else knew it he said but me he said but God condemned me because it was in my heart I was critical he said I'd see a woman walk by he said oh God you ought to Destroyer you remember he did that when he was in the restaurant a woman sitting there with his arms around just a mess and brother Brown was like God just wipe this whole thing off God said let me take you behind the door here for a minute uh you and I have talked together we're fixing to have a conversation it's going to be just one way right that's right he didn't go back there and argue with God God said um let me show you your sins I'm not going to show you the woman's and the man's and the police officer and all that I'm going to show you yours right and know what he said I'm going to show you yours he said he said that blood would hit hit the Lord's head and said blood would splatter everywhere and God said those are your sins hitting him in the head a prophet but he was being critical he was condemning oh yeah sure we condemn things right but we shouldn't do it with a critical spirit you should do it it's like brother R I'll read it to you this afternoon he said let God be critical now what he what does he mean let him criticize through his word because he God is going to tell you what's true he's not going to he's not going to soft so but he's going to tell you what's true and if you don't do it you're going to die all right so that you know he just but he lays it out there but let's not be critical let's not be selfish but we'll talk about that let's get through this brotherly kindness amen and let's all be better Christians uh to each other
