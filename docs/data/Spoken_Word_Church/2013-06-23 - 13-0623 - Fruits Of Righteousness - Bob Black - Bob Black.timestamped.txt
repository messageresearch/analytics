[0:08] thank you
[0:09] my parents are with us this morning
[0:18] and my mom just retired
[0:25] so she's feeling good
[0:30] all right we're going to look at Matthew
[0:32] chapter 7.
[0:34] and verse 16 today
[0:44] not dead fishes
[0:59] Matthew chapter 7 verse 16.
[1:11] a lot of times we read Rome
[1:15] speak up we can't hear you good okay
[1:18] here's a scripture that a lot of times
[1:20] maybe we look at a little wrong so uh
[1:24] what this is what I want to look at this
[1:27] morning
[1:29] um Matthew chapter 7 verse 16. let's
[1:32] start at verse 15. beware of false
[1:35] prophets which come to you
[1:38] but inwardly they are having rules can
[1:41] y'all hear me I can turn the fan off
[1:45] no no no no no no just speak up yeah
[1:54] inwardly they are ravening rules you
[1:57] shall know them by their fruits the men
[2:00] get a greatness of thorns or feets or
[2:03] thistles
[2:04] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[2:07] good fruit but a corrupt tree brings
[2:10] forth evil Freedom a good tree cannot
[2:13] bring forth evil for you neither can a
[2:16] corrupt three bring forth good Freedom
[2:18] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[2:21] for you is handed down and cast Into the
[2:24] Fire wherefore buy their fruits
[2:33] fruits of the spirit and and a lot of
[2:36] times we read through the nine fruits
[2:39] and we see that you know you're supposed
[2:40] to have them express love and joy and
[2:43] those things and and uh you know brother
[2:45] Brown said that the Christian Science
[2:47] expresses more love than we can and so
[2:50] you look at them and think uh a more
[2:53] love a lot of times it seems like we do
[2:55] and uh so what exactly is love and why
[3:01] is it so important you know brother
[3:02] Brown talked about
[3:04] um the evidence with the evidence of the
[3:06] Holy Ghost really is is that you believe
[3:08] the word for your day the word that was
[3:10] brought in the season that it was
[3:12] supposed to be brought in but here Jesus
[3:14] says it by by their fruit you shall know
[3:18] them
[3:18] and this little picture here is a fig
[3:21] tree and these are fish and uh
[3:28] you know uh if you look at a fig tree
[3:31] one time Jesus in Mark chapter 11 Jesus
[3:35] was walking by a peak tree over there in
[3:37] Israel where they they just grow so huge
[3:40] when he looked at the tree and he said
[3:42] well there's no fruit on this tree and
[3:44] so he cursed the tree because here in in
[3:46] Matthew uh he said a tree that doesn't
[3:51] bear forth fruit is going to be hewned
[3:53] down and cast Into the Fire
[3:55] so uh he wasn't just a person at
[3:59] haphazardly but he was trying to teach
[4:00] his Apostle something and you know uh
[4:05] right after he spoke that right after he
[4:07] cursed it he he proceeded to tell his
[4:10] his disciples uh he he began to open up
[4:14] what fruits were and if you kind of I
[4:17] won't read the I believe we're familiar
[4:21] enough with the with the little story
[4:22] that he began to talk about
[4:27] you know when if you really have faith
[4:29] then you can say to a mountain be cast
[4:32] into the seeds and it will it will obey
[4:35] you because you're bearing for through
[4:38] the lure for your age is is being pushed
[4:42] up within you and quickened by the
[4:44] spirit of God that so that you act just
[4:48] like Jesus
[4:49] active so that you obey you obey the
[4:53] word you uh you move in the same line
[4:56] that Jesus moved in now there's what's
[5:01] really interesting about the Fig Tree is
[5:03] that you never see you know with a lot
[5:06] of other plants uh there's a little
[5:08] honeybee or a different wasp and things
[5:11] come along that you can see but with the
[5:14] Fig Tree it's a mystery how it gets
[5:15] fertilized how uh the the pollen from
[5:20] One Tree comes into the pollen of
[5:22] another tree and fertilizes it and you
[5:26] know to me it's a mystery in the gospel
[5:28] how that happens
[5:30] how all these things are are just
[5:33] Mysteries you know Paul talked about in
[5:35] the Old Testament they look through a
[5:36] glass Darkly it was like they uh or even
[5:39] today you know
[5:41] it's not it's not maybe not clear what's
[5:44] what's going on but what happens is um
[5:48] there's a little wasp called a fig a fig
[5:51] wasp that coke slides into a small small
[5:55] hole and as it does it tears off its
[5:58] wings it loses everything it loses its
[6:01] wings and its antenna because it's
[6:02] trying to get through this little small
[6:04] hole and once it gets in there it
[6:06] pollinates that uh
[6:09] that uh that fig
[6:11] and it stays inside of that feed and it
[6:15] gives its life it dies inside of the Fig
[6:18] so that that fig can drop and be more be
[6:21] uh produce another another fig tree
[6:24] and you know you can say if you look at
[6:28] this in the spiritual you say well if if
[6:32] you look at yourself like that fig you
[6:34] say well you know I always was eternal I
[6:38] always had this this predestinating seed
[6:41] so I don't need that wasp but that wasp
[6:44] had to come and fertilize this food and
[6:47] it's a
[6:48] it's a a mystery because you can look at
[6:52] that and not see and you know I was
[6:55] thinking about how the you know brother
[6:57] Brown before he preached the seals he's
[6:58] increased that sermon Christ hidden in
[7:01] Simplicity and revealing and saying how
[7:03] the gospel is supposed to be so simple
[7:06] and I I've just been reading a lot of
[7:09] quotes it's been real good for me about
[7:10] all the things that little brown had to
[7:12] say about how simple the gospel is
[7:14] because the gospel is received by a real
[7:17] simple people and it's supposed to be
[7:19] real simple so that just so simple that
[7:24] just a little small little wasp so
[7:26] simple that the world overlooks how how
[7:29] just Sublime it is that a little wasps
[7:32] will fertilize this
[7:33] so let's uh
[7:35] since we kind of talked about that
[7:37] listen let's turn over to Genesis
[7:39] chapter one
[7:42] and take a look at how
[7:48] what we're talking about
[7:55] and then we'll read some quotes
[7:58] let's look at verse one in the beginning
[8:00] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[8:03] and the Earth was without form of void
[8:05] and darkness was upon the face of the
[8:07] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[8:09] the face of the water
[8:10] now now this is a big stumbling block
[8:14] for me because you know schools are
[8:16] teaching evolution and you say well how
[8:18] could the world be really millions of
[8:21] years old or whatever now brother
[8:22] Randall said when you read this there's
[8:24] a period at the end of that first verse
[8:26] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[8:27] and the Earth and now he created it
[8:30] and at some point now the world was in
[8:33] darkness and it's voided just like when
[8:36] you were in sin you were in darkness
[8:38] that's right within a long came life and
[8:41] at some point maybe you know brother
[8:44] Graham talked about uh there was laying
[8:47] in the earth seeds already Seas laying
[8:51] in the earth and when the light struck
[8:53] them let's turn over to verse 11.
[8:59] and God said
[9:01] let the Earth bring forth grass there's
[9:04] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[9:06] yielding fruit after it's kind and
[9:08] seated in itself upon the Earth and it
[9:10] was so and the Earth brought forth your
[9:13] ass and Herb yielding the seed after his
[9:14] kind and the tree yielding fruit whose
[9:17] seed was in itself after his kind and
[9:20] God saw that it was good
[9:22] now there's the whole story of the whole
[9:25] Plan of Redemption everything right
[9:26] there is that they will see the Earth
[9:28] and God when the light is showing up
[9:30] when it began to produce and over time
[9:33] you know that seed take take a take a
[9:36] look at this one little seed in it it's
[9:37] sprouted up and it began to grow and
[9:41] grow from to the stall to the shook
[9:45] until that Original Seed that laid in
[9:48] the ground produced the same thing again
[9:50] the the uh you know brother Brown talked
[9:53] about the corner the corner wheat and
[9:56] and that's what down through the seven
[10:00] Church ages God the whole earth has been
[10:03] waiting and rolling for the original sea
[10:05] to be made manifested again and the
[10:07] original sea is what what uh
[10:11] what we're looking for is for this fruit
[10:13] to be born out the the fruit is the
[10:17] Original Seed made manifest again
[10:19] so think about the nine spiritual fruits
[10:23] these nine fruits are the attributes of
[10:25] God made manifest and somebody that's
[10:28] walking on the earth love joy and peace
[10:30] and we look at these love joy and peace
[10:32] and and long-suffering and Temperance
[10:35] and faith and all of these fruits and
[10:38] think and and you know without the
[10:41] revelation of the Holy Ghost we have a
[10:43] conception in our own mind that's
[10:45] different than what it really is what
[10:48] love really is
[10:51] so let's look at Psalm chapter one
[11:09] David
[11:11] called a vision
[11:13] I believe
[11:15] and you know a long time you think well
[11:17] you know I don't have visions of things
[11:19] but I know a prophet that came and saw
[11:23] Ephesians and he gave me the vision that
[11:26] we could fulfill it
[11:27] you know without a profit you know we we
[11:30] would be proven in darkness without
[11:32] knowing what to do but a prophet came in
[11:35] the season that God ordained it to come
[11:38] so that we can manifest the word for our
[11:40] age
[11:41] now so Psalm 1 verse 1 blessed is the
[11:45] man that walked at the knot in the
[11:47] Council of the ungodly
[11:50] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[11:53] nor sit up in the seat of the storm
[11:58] I'm just read it the whole uh down to
[12:00] verse three and then we'll go back
[12:01] through it but his Delight
[12:03] is in the law of the Lord and in his law
[12:06] that he meditate day and night
[12:08] I think she'll be like a tree planted by
[12:11] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[12:14] his fruit in his season his Leaf also
[12:17] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[12:20] shall prosper
[12:21] blessed is the man now think about how
[12:26] blessed you are if you are born of the
[12:29] spirit of God because you're not part of
[12:31] the denominational system anymore you're
[12:33] grafted in to uh the grafted into the
[12:36] vine you know a people that didn't even
[12:39] deserve it would put this gentile people
[12:42] that were part of were put into were
[12:44] grafted into the original life this
[12:47] Divine that we can become partakers of
[12:50] God a great Plan of Redemption
[12:52] so we're not
[12:55] we're so blessed and that walketh in the
[12:58] counsel of the ungodly now you know the
[13:02] scriptures make a big difference between
[13:03] ungodly and Sinners and a sinner is uh
[13:07] you know vote around talk about how God
[13:09] loves Sinners he hates sin but he loves
[13:11] Sinners because he's he's drawing that
[13:13] they have I hope but now ungodly they
[13:16] say I'm you know they sit in a church
[13:17] and say I understand the law I
[13:20] understand what the Bible teaches but
[13:22] it's not made manifesting them
[13:25] okay
[13:26] just like the Pharisee said we know what
[13:30] the law teaches we know you know they
[13:33] say I that you're not supposed to be
[13:36] healing people are on the Sabbath day
[13:37] you're not supposed to be uh uh teaching
[13:40] on the Sabbath and these things but the
[13:42] law was made alive right in front of
[13:45] them the fruits of the word were being
[13:48] born right May manifest right in front
[13:51] of them and they still receive it
[13:52] because they have they had the word the
[13:55] letter of the word and it wasn't Made
[13:57] Alive it was a very very forth fruit now
[14:00] that's ungodly as they say I I am a
[14:04] Christian but they're not bearing force
[14:05] of fruits the word is not the word for
[14:09] their day is not being made manifesting
[14:11] in you know and knows that he uh
[14:13] probably a lot of people said we're
[14:15] we're we can go to church or whatever
[14:18] the uh the plan of the day what you know
[14:20] that we go to a denomination or we uh we
[14:24] we're Christians or whatever you know
[14:26] they might have said then but Noah was
[14:30] the one in the ark because he he wrote a
[14:32] message for the day they didn't catch
[14:34] his vision then they uh their tree was
[14:38] healing down and swallowed up in the
[14:41] fluid
[14:43] and uh
[14:45] and then the next verse let's see the
[14:47] next little piece but his Delight is in
[14:49] the law of the Lord and his law that he
[14:52] meditate day and night now I believe
[14:55] this is how you bear forth proofs by
[14:57] listening to the books and the tales by
[15:00] keeping your mind constantly on God you
[15:03] see if you say well I'm going to let uh
[15:05] just to be frank don't let go to hell do
[15:08] my studying for me I'm going to let uh
[15:11] I'm just gonna uh worry about reading
[15:14] the Bible worry about reading the the
[15:15] message in the Sunday school class but
[15:18] you must constantly be meditating on the
[15:20] word and program taught us how to how to
[15:23] meditate he said when you when you stop
[15:24] and think about the Lord don't blink
[15:26] your mind out because that's when the
[15:28] Devil comes in but think about how
[15:31] things fit together and think about how
[15:34] you know run it through if you can't run
[15:36] it through all the scripture from
[15:38] Genesis to Revelation that something's
[15:40] all for your Revelation and meditate on
[15:42] it constantly
[15:45] you know Joshua said the book of the law
[15:48] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[15:49] Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[15:51] night
[15:52] the thou mayest observed to do according
[15:55] to all that is written therein within
[15:58] Thou shalt make thy ways prosperous and
[16:00] then thy shalt have good success that
[16:03] man subserved to do to do according to
[16:06] all that is written therein
[16:08] now we put a lot of weight on
[16:11] understanding and knowledge but you know
[16:13] all down through the scriptures they
[16:14] they didn't just it wasn't just their
[16:16] faith but they had the works to go with
[16:18] it what if Abel would have said I I have
[16:21] a revelation of faith that I should take
[16:24] a lamb and he didn't do it he had to
[16:26] take the lane of him it had to be
[16:27] offered I remember reading a story from
[16:30] Charles Spurgeon where he said he said
[16:33] uh there was a man in this congregation
[16:35] that said he had been working with him
[16:37] and trying to get him to see that he
[16:39] needed to be baptized and finally the
[16:41] man saw it I see what the scripture is
[16:43] saying about being baptized but he still
[16:46] wouldn't go and be baptized and what
[16:49] what kind of state does that put that
[16:50] man in where he sees it but he won't go
[16:52] and do it just like uh at Candice
[16:55] Barnett they saw or they should have
[16:58] seen I'll say it like that they should
[17:00] have seen that they should go on then
[17:02] but they didn't
[17:04] okay
[17:06] let's see where a man
[17:12] and he shall be
[17:15] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[17:17] water
[17:19] by the rivers of water now the rivers
[17:22] are what we're talking about these nine
[17:25] spiritual gifts now how did you come to
[17:27] the water you can't go Water by seeing
[17:30] these nine uh these nine fruits
[17:33] manifested in somebody whether it was
[17:35] bug random on the tape or whether it was
[17:37] somebody that came and sat down with you
[17:39] and explained to you the scripture
[17:40] through these rivers that came out of
[17:43] this one water it was one water not by
[17:46] one phase by one baptism by one Lord
[17:49] we're saved by one water and these nine
[17:53] Rivers come out and reach out to grab us
[17:56] through through people for one water and
[18:00] uh
[18:01] you know brother Branham explained it he
[18:03] talked about how it was the nine
[18:04] spiritual the nine fruits and he also
[18:07] said it was the Old and New Testament
[18:08] that sins major contribution on what it
[18:12] is is the word the fruits and I think
[18:14] about the fruits all of the Bible being
[18:17] made manifest the nine spiritual fruits
[18:21] all the old and the New Testament coming
[18:23] to life
[18:24] and that's what the the the
[18:27] Sadducees and the Pharisees failed
[18:30] understand is it's not just a uh
[18:33] but it's not just
[18:37] being able to read and being able to
[18:39] quote what program said I mean that well
[18:42] you know they they look they were able
[18:43] to quote what Moses said
[18:45] they had it they had it so ingrained in
[18:48] their mind what Moses said that you know
[18:50] is is told that they could take a scroll
[18:52] and roll it up and put a pencil or a
[18:54] poke hole through it and know which
[18:56] letter that what they poked it through
[18:58] with every letter that they touched but
[19:01] they knew the word so much but the word
[19:03] wasn't alive again
[19:04] these fruits weren't made manifest
[19:08] the fruit is the life
[19:12] that bringeth forth
[19:14] his fruit
[19:17] in his season
[19:21] that bringeth forth his fruit now you
[19:24] are a tree
[19:26] you're a part but to bring forth these
[19:29] fruits you've got to be part of that
[19:31] tree that gave his life on doubt
[19:35] so he's bringing forth his fruit in his
[19:39] season is God's fruit in the prophet
[19:42] season
[19:45] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[19:47] whatsoever he doeth
[19:49] shall prospered you know
[19:52] the the
[19:54] brother Brown priest a sermon called the
[19:56] dry tree and you were just looking at
[19:58] how uh to fertilize one of these things
[20:01] you need two trees you need a bright
[20:04] green tree and you need a bright tree
[20:06] and Jesus came to Earth to bridge the
[20:10] gap so to speak between so that you know
[20:14] there was no way for us to get back to
[20:16] the variety that's right because Adam
[20:19] and Eve had turned it down in the Garden
[20:21] of Eden so he had to come and bring that
[20:25] gap for us and give his life just that
[20:27] little like that little fig wasp he gave
[20:29] his life so that that fig would be
[20:31] fertilized
[20:33] and
[20:34] once he gave his life that bridery was
[20:38] planted on the day of Pentecost and it
[20:41] began to grow and grow and grow until
[20:46] that's why it says his Leaf also shall
[20:49] not live
[20:50] the plan and the purpose of that dry
[20:53] tree is not going to is going to be
[20:56] accomplished because uh
[21:00] is predestining to be fulfilled just
[21:03] like in Genesis 1 11 the seeds that were
[21:06] in the earth were predestinated to come
[21:09] forth to make manifested to make
[21:12] manifest The Original Seed and
[21:15] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper his
[21:18] Leaf shall not wither that's a promise
[21:20] for us too when you were born again you
[21:22] will never die you're uh filled with the
[21:25] Holy Ghost and you have a promise but
[21:27] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[21:33] why he got predestinated fruit in there
[21:36] you can't destroy it because it's
[21:38] predestinated
[21:40] they're Philippians 1 11 says that you
[21:42] may be sincere and without offense till
[21:44] the day of Christ
[21:46] being filled with the fruits of
[21:48] righteousness and we know righteousness
[21:50] coming from the Hebrew word which means
[21:53] one new numeric surpasses their iniquity
[21:56] how can my marriage surpass my iniquity
[21:58] the only way my mirror can surpass my
[22:00] iniquity is if I'm part of that tree
[22:03] that in his life on Calvin that he died
[22:05] in his Merit uh surpasses my iniquity
[22:09] now
[22:13] fruits all down through scripture the
[22:16] fruits were the the
[22:21] bore record of what was true
[22:24] um let's uh well I won't turn there I'll
[22:26] just tell the story in Numbers chapter
[22:28] 17 we were looking at the number 17 a
[22:31] while ago here's a number 17. uh they
[22:34] were the Israelites wanted to know
[22:37] if Aaron really was
[22:40] the one you know that the one that they
[22:43] should the the priest
[22:45] if he was the one that God had chosen
[22:48] now here's how God knows
[22:51] prove to the world that God has chosen
[22:53] to divide me but believing the word for
[22:56] your day and then making it come
[22:57] manifest in your life so they wanted to
[23:00] know what Aaron are you the right one
[23:02] that all this contention in the in the
[23:05] midst of the people and so Moses say put
[23:07] your name and and your in the staff you
[23:10] know they put the staff in the 12 Trials
[23:13] of Israel and Aaron put his name in the
[23:15] staff of Levi and then laid it before
[23:17] the in before the the presence of the
[23:21] Chicago just like the seeds in Genesis 1
[23:24] that when the light came the S the light
[23:27] from the s-u-n Came Upon those seeds and
[23:30] they Rose and made manifest in order
[23:35] yeah so they deleted it before the life
[23:37] of the son behind that Shekinah Glory
[23:42] and that staff that was dead it was it
[23:45] was chopped off
[23:46] it brought forth and only it didn't just
[23:51] bring forth leaves and everything but it
[23:53] went through the whole process until it
[23:54] was fruit and they bore fruit and that's
[23:57] how they knew that God was with Eric
[24:01] in Galatians 5 22 23 says but the fruit
[24:05] of the spirit is love joy peace
[24:08] long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith
[24:12] meekness temperance against such there
[24:16] is no law now how can you have a law
[24:19] against God's word being made manifest
[24:22] there is no law That's the Law being
[24:24] fulfilled that's law of Grace right
[24:27] there but brother Dale's been preaching
[24:28] on Law and Grace now you can read the
[24:31] Old Testament law but when it becomes a
[24:34] grace to you that's the law being made
[24:36] manifest so what is
[24:40] What is love
[24:51] now program said any questions and
[24:54] answers 1964 he said now
[24:56] he's talking about different things that
[24:58] we look at as the evidence of the Holy
[25:00] Ghost that's no evidence of holy ghosts
[25:01] you can't rely up on that you can't rely
[25:03] upon the fruit of the spirit because the
[25:05] first fruit of this period of love and
[25:07] the Christian Science exercise more love
[25:09] than anybody I know of and they even
[25:12] deny Jesus Christ being Divine you know
[25:15] I think a lot of times we have our own
[25:18] mental conception of what love is and
[25:20] today love is acceptance of anything
[25:23] anything goes
[25:25] just whatever wrap your arms around it
[25:27] and draw it close to you because as long
[25:30] as this you know as long as it's out
[25:32] there then you know people say you're
[25:34] not lovely if you don't Embrace just
[25:37] whatever Embrace false Doctrine Embrace
[25:40] uh wrong living Embrace everything
[25:43] that's not right but um Real Love is in
[25:47] John chapter 5 and I just got about
[25:50] is that I don't know if that clocks fast
[25:52] anymore
[25:54] so let's look at John chapter five to
[25:57] see what real love is
[26:12] John chapter 5 verse one after this
[26:15] there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus
[26:18] went up to Jerusalem
[26:20] now there's that Jerusalem by the sheet
[26:22] Market a pool which is called in a
[26:23] Hebrew tune but this is having fried
[26:25] porches in these led great multitude of
[26:28] impotent folks with blind hot withered
[26:30] waiting for the moving of the water for
[26:32] an angel went down at a certain season
[26:34] into the pool and Troubled Water
[26:35] whatsoever then first after the trip
[26:38] whosoever they first draft of the
[26:39] turbine of the water stepped in was made
[26:40] whole of whatsoever disease he had and a
[26:43] certain man was there which had an
[26:44] infirmity 30 and eight years when Jesus
[26:47] saw and lie and knew that he had been
[26:49] now a long time in that case he said
[26:51] unto them wilt thou be made whole now
[26:55] our conception of Love is that he would
[26:57] just go through and just because he had
[26:59] the power within him to just heal
[27:01] everybody why did he go and brother
[27:03] Brandon said this man he he
[27:05] escapes me I can't remember exactly what
[27:07] he said was wrong with him but he could
[27:09] get up and walk he he uh he he uh
[27:14] you know they were I'm sure there were
[27:17] much worse cases than this man so why
[27:19] did he go to this man it was because we
[27:22] have our conception of love is not what
[27:25] God's conception is and brother Reynolds
[27:27] said that love and compassion is to do
[27:30] the will of God that's what love is it's
[27:33] to do his will so uh you know brother
[27:36] random told the story about how people
[27:37] were coming in to say why don't we pray
[27:40] for my aunt so that they would be healed
[27:42] why why won't God just heal my aunt or
[27:45] somebody that they have relatives and
[27:46] people that didn't even believe the
[27:48] message didn't even believe weren't even
[27:50] Christians but they wanted them to be
[27:52] healed but God doesn't work that like
[27:54] that he goes according to uh he's got to
[27:57] manifest his word it just it amazes me
[28:01] the goodness of God how people would
[28:03] come into the prayer line and say you
[28:06] know just horrible sins in their life
[28:09] and brother I will say do you repent and
[28:12] you think well maybe they've got to get
[28:14] go through a little grace period where a
[28:17] little trial period where to prove them
[28:18] and things but no right then they would
[28:21] receive their healing they didn't have
[28:23] to didn't take a long time
[28:25] you repent and you're healed but that's
[28:27] that's what uh God doesn't just go out
[28:31] and heal willy-nilly but he goes he knew
[28:35] that this man would receive it he knew
[28:39] it and that's how you predestinated by
[28:41] four knowledge because he knew that this
[28:44] man when he would come to him and say
[28:46] well thou be made whole the infinite man
[28:48] would answer him said and say uh that he
[28:51] would he when he told him rise took up
[28:53] thy man and walk he knew he wouldn't
[28:55] argue with it that he would just rise
[28:57] and take up his bed and go believe him
[28:59] and that's what real love is and uh just
[29:04] finishing up
[29:06] first John 2 15 says love not the world
[29:09] that we're talking about manifesting the
[29:12] word I'm gonna just leave it real quick
[29:14] hello not the world neither of the
[29:16] things that are in the world if any man
[29:17] loved the world the love of the father
[29:19] is not in it now manifesting the word if
[29:22] you love the things of the world the
[29:24] love of the father is not even in you
[29:26] you see John 14 15 if you love me keep
[29:30] my Commandments
[29:31] there's another if you're if you have
[29:34] faith then manifested mine works John 14
[29:38] 23 Jesus answered and said in the name
[29:40] of a man love me he will keep my words
[29:41] and my father will love him and we will
[29:44] come unto him and make our boat with him
[29:46] in John 15 9 as a father have loved me
[29:50] so have I loved you continue in my love
[29:53] if you keep my Commandments you shall
[29:56] abide in my love even as I have kept my
[29:58] father's Commandments and abide in his
[30:00] love
[30:01] of loving God is is doing just like
[30:05] Jesus did which is obedience to God's
[30:09] Will and we'll stop right there
