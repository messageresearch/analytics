========================================

that's all in the mind set of listening to the Word of God left some now let's go to John one now what we're doing is in our Sunday School class we're taking me and we've been it's a bit of theme we've had for several weeks is the brother Brown said God came in three sons name so the man's son of God is undated and in those dispensation it's really it's really it has to be a revelation but it has to be taught because the Son of God has one thing to do the Son of man has a purpose and the son of David have the perfect now we know we know as a fact that the son of david has nothing to do with us because we're Gentile but it still is God and we have to understand that he's going to be the son of David in the millennium and he's going to be to the Jews in the Millennium but we got to come back and go in like brother brownson go into the mind of God find out what the Sun God his characteristics are find out what the Son of Man characteristic are and find out what the son of David's characteristics are okay because in other words this whole to me the message of the hour is the is the highest understanding of God we could ever have badness have an understanding of God kind of costs have an understanding of God Luther had an understanding of God which they have an understanding God but when the Prophet came this is the Eagle age it's not just for brother branham when he went up we went up with him and into the Eagle anointing and we're able to see right now not in the prophetic like brother Brown saw it but he called us little Eagle little Messiah so so that's what he said about me so I'm going to take that so then I can do we've always said around here a lot of people think that that you know some things are deep and some things I just one thing for sure it brother ground and preach stick you want to be able to understand I don't care what it is he preached it it was for somebody to understand not for everybody but for somebody to understand if brother gonna preach the seals we ought to be able to understand the seals if he preached down 70 which we ought to be able to understand it because he was a property of bringing what the perfect interpretation by divine vindication all right so we know it's been medicated nonetheless read here let's begin because i think this this brings us to the to the son of god is what we started on because the son of god was the creator all right do I have the son of God is the creator some of you that's been in here for 23 months you know we've already been through this but I'm going to back up and we're going to i'm not even going to tape it will put it on there but i'm i'm gonna put it on the phone and the computer because i'm gonna back up and let's look at we've been on the son of god we haven't gotten some man yet so we've been on some god and what is the son of God you see well the son of god was Jesus Christ yeah but he was the son of man right he was the son of man right the son of god was before all things so you got to back up before you get the son of man here you got to have the Son of God because of the Bible says the Son of God because dad asked this question many years ago he told everybody to write down who if you think the Son of God who you thinking of lever my Road Jesus Christ well that's true in a point but it's not true the son of god was the creator we know it was Jesus Christ but it was Christ that was doing the creating even even like we said many times before Peter jesus said who demands say I the Son of Man am now Peter Dan telling me the son of man was he told him to the Son of God woof because Peter said something inside of you what he was he could understand that that man in human flesh was gone but he knew there was something inside that man he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God which was the son of God revelation because what Jesus said I'll build my church on the Son of God revelation right nice on a man yet but Son of God revelation so let's find out who that son got it and john wants that in the beginning was the word now we looked up that word and that word if you tag it it means what you cross references in the scrums it means logos our speech are the son of God coming down to the logos and as I said many times before you say well this is hard listen let me tell you something if God brought it this way this is the only way you're going to be able to understand you right got it so if you don't understand you need to pray for revelation if you don't understand this so this is that this is the simplest way brother William that God brought it or heat abroad it another way cuz gotten it does not like us that went fishing this weekend and I forgot the jelly and I forgot the mustard not forgot to live God don't forget yeah once he makes a plan it's gonna but he's already seen it man it made my bed alright so he doesn't he doesn't go in so awesome and done that no whatever he says that's the way it's going to be and that's the only way you can understand you cuz remember he looked down through time and saw you and how you would come so how can he make it any other way okay he can make it any other way that's the way he had to come in the beginning was to okaasan the logos was we've gone into low-cost our Word was God the same was in the beginning with God so we got to go back into the beginning to the creation all things were made by him all things were made by this whoever this logos is that's the Creator I all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made right so he was the creator in him was life into life with a lot of men will stop right there so the revelation of the Son of God is one thing jesus said we must worship in spirit God is a spirit alright so as we see what brethren said that that we see a halo of light and that halo of life I've said many times before it and I don't want to seem contrary but remember if we were made in His image we weren't made a halo light so God's always been a human God's always been a man it's just the form that he reveals itself and many times I've said before if Moses had a revelation when he walked up to that burning bush and he saw a bush burning and a man talking to him out of the bush if Moses would have had a revelation like we have a revelation of who that was we just say a man let's see a man right because our revelation is God is a man Moses knew there was a god but he worshipped him in spirit he worshipped him as the Creator alright so God had to and you say well why you got revealing stuff him as a man remember later on he did right Moses said now I really want to see who you are down through this journey Moses said god I want to see you now he's seen God he saw that pillar fire he saw the one that let him he talked to him lift a year the Bible said but one day Moses finally said I want to see who you are and I want to see your real form so what do you got dude is it okay cuz you'll stand in the cleft of the rock don't stand in a rock when you can't see just a little way you don't want Stan outfield you want to stay where he had a view any sea wall by what he said was he said it was what the form of a man who's right well to me that was this same man this theophany which was Jesus Christ prefigured the prophet said right mmm which is the Holy Spirit and we come down and brought he's also brother Rob says many times it's the Angel of the Covenant payment now what happens with this son of God now you say well why don't have to be in southern God first because remember God knew all things he was spirit god there's no way that spirit guide could enter and to listen he could he couldn't enter into Moses and make him a son of God no nobody in the Old Testament had a new birth they did not have an indwelling of God because Allah because the blood of bulls and goats would just cover since Oh God is the spirit he can come down and annoy Moses and then you know the Bible says when he was anointed you couldn't even see his face they had to put a veil over but now when he stepped back from Moses Moses with man he killed an Egyptian he made mistakes he did things wrong he got a little angry one day and smoke to rock instead of speaking to the rider alright so the Holy Spirit is what led the people because remember brother Brown said it was God above got in her way of the people and then you know got it or God with the people and then got into people alright so so god there's no way got to come down now he could come down at the angel the Covenant he could come down to the captain of the hope he can come down as Melchizedek right but Melchizedek and that form couldn't save you enough right hey but that was the Savior yeah but in that form he just created a body stepped into the body done his work stepped out of the body that was the son of god that was not the son of man called the Son of man has to be mine and your brother see that's what we're going to get later on but let's stay with the Sun God for a little while theophany in the beginning God created the heavens in the earth and then Genesis 126 says and God created man in his own image so we must be human God must be human because he made us human a man but he made a spirit man first he said just like the Holy Spirit controls today he said that's what was controlling in the Garden of Eden what did I do Adam when he spoke what happened on the earth guy said we've been over this before God said hey that's my son that's my same fault that's the same thought I had all right what problem is is when the ball came we were talking about last week that Genesis 3 15 God said I'll put enmity once the sin came God is the one that did two separate God had to separate himself from man be the Son of God over the people could he couldn't end well no one like he did Adam the Bible says Adam was the son of God right so Adam was the only Son of God in the Old Testament right the only Son of God in the Old Testament cuz God did dwell in South abba animal was an amateur god but no one else after the fall everyone was anointed now sure they're safe I said Jeremiah all those ones they're going to be in heaven but they're not going to be the bride of Jesus Christ baby there will not be only the proud of Jesus Christ it's when that son of God comes into the son of man that's bright this form is spirit form sure this is sons this is all of us back before the foundation of the world when the sons of God shouted for joy what we were in Christ and the spirit we work people walking around backs of Mormon that's the Mormon doctrine and I talked to some Mormons and that's what they believed that you live one time before you lived in heaven and Jesus and Lucifer were brothers and God give a plan of salvation out and Jesus's plan was better than the devil and God chose jesus' instead of the devil's and that's why the devil got cast out but jesus had to come down and save the people but what happened was we were all up there and we had to go take the form human form to fall so we could go back I said you're playing no fit a your plan actually it's complicated my plan is God is the creator where are the ones that fell he's the one that came he's the one who gave his life and he's 18 branch by God by said that to me that simple ma'am so we were in gone in the beginning was the low cost the word and as we said many times before the birth that you have now your new birth is the birth of this word that God knew you would need when you got here there I understand that you connect your somewhere and you're to be born again you have to connect with this word of God you can't get born again reading war and peace are some novel or whatever you have to get born again by the word because then beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and you go down to verse 14 and that word that logos was made flesh and dwelt among us all right so that son of God Jesus told Peter Peter I'll build my church on that revelation because remember the Son of Man revelation was lost now to the church ages property God told us that only in the end time does the Son of Man revelation come back Paul never had a real revelation of the Sun man because remember the Son of Man look here's the real yes this is real simple the son of god never seen the Son of God doesn't need Redemption the Son of God never had a bad cough the son of god never had anything to do sin at all the song god never felt a man ok so it's pure remember even the Son of Man Jesus did you say that against the son of man you'll be forgiven but when he the Holy Ghost is come you say that against him it will never be forgiven in other words while you're on earth do you say something against your brother that that's human being that's flesh man right but now if you say something against what's inside that man say something to guess that you bless being the Holy go right right man so to me that's the dispensation is looking at the Son of God and some land but the Son of God ever since I'm God never needed Redemption triaminic right nope son of God is a creator he can he's God he can't sin he can't have a bathtub it's perfect hey man and even that Jesus is 126 man when God said let's let us make man in our image whatever came forth out of them which was the Holy goat whatever came out of them had to be the same way yeah because brother Brown said staying in that formerly would have been fine but when God knew when he put that 21-26 man into that 27 man in flesh that's when he knew we would fall because Adam didn't fall in his soul he's felling his flesh right his spirit and his flesh got ruined but now remember he was still son of god man yeah he was still son of God so that's what we have to look the Son of God doesn't need Redemption now what happens is we have to look at this son of God down through the Old Testament so there was sure there was Redemption that was in the people but Jesus Christ the thing about this this morning Jesus Christ came with the Sun God in him not to different people he was only one God but that son of God came into the son of man and he became the Sun man because he took on human flesh cuz even Ezekiel you say well sure Ezekiel says son of man promised out who was that in his he flew in from side what is Ezekiel it was a holy go Ian and he was showing if you look in his vehicle you see the one that you see one you see the Son of Man prophesied son named prophesied but now watch when you get to the three Hebrew children King Nebuchadnezzar knew that could have been human flesh in that fiery furnace but he didn't call it the son of man he said the fourth man must be the Son of God in other words the Spirit is the only one that could that could go into that fiery furnace and help the other three that were in flesh and him walking around talking to it so that had to be the Sun God because remember the Bible perfect a man I was perfect so if it's that son of God then we must look at that son of God revelation and all down through the church ages it was the revelation of the signs I because Jesus told Peter said Peter on this rock or on what on this revelation of the Sun God will I build a turf not so mad it's not a God revelation which is what I Holy go all right any question yes the word with you wouldn't have two ways always with that's right see man takes it and separates him but to me that's like such true said my thoughts were with me they're my heart I can't help grow wings talks about Sam start my mom thought that was God in the beginning was the low cost what he had to think about it before he spoke it you can't just speak and not be thinking us all of us do a lot of that her mouth gets in gear before our brain does who you mean sometimes I remind overriding I mean but that's our humanity it never works that way in God though he never said anything he's never have a work recent of god don't say oops no he's already seen this whole thing like I said before he knew what we needed so he put it in the word in the beginning was the word got this form of this Bible and hey let me promise you one thing you don't carry Bibles around when we get to heaven right no we are going to be the Living Word wherever we're beginning to see that now I think that don't throw your Bible the way don't throw your message books away but we should become the clothes we should become the scripture and then when we get to glory we're not going to carry a big Bible around we're going to be the Bible made mouth that's just the way God wanted it man to me it's very simple God sees the end from the beginning but he had to be a savior because that was one of the attributes of this man so he had to put us in flesh not to make us fall but putting us in flesh knew we would fall and need to save your need a man to come down this man come down put on human flesh be born a baby as mal Cassidy one more Nevada so now casually could not be your brother because the son of and your brother man the Son of Man is where is the key to the whole thing why do you think some man's got to come back in the end time if there's not the key to the whole thing comes the Son of Man was 2000 years ago lanius died go up into glory send the Holy goes back down which is the son of God why do you just leave it that way well like I said before son of God don't need Redemption we had sons of man need Redemption and if son of god never took a body shame right he never changes if this man changes he's not God the Son of Man is the one that was buried and took a body change right so that's why meaning you have to be out we are now under the Son of Man revelation and it's not just because William Brown said sorry that's just not cuz he said no he's got to be revealed to you man it's got to be revealed to all of us because the Son of God like I said the son of God sons have gone to you know all down through time Luther Wesley they're all laying in the grave the flesh part of them are laying in the grave waiting on somebody to catch that son of man revelation again in the end time to do what to resurrect those body because the son of man took a resurrection to santander in the interaction something I've done here redemption none of God doesn't need that he's the one he created everything he's one of creative out of here in them but when you bring that down into the Sun land that son of man is the most important to me it's the most important is the key because when I was a son of man you won't understand son of god and you won't understand son David because what the Son of man has to come down here God in human flesh I'm talking about sons of men now I'm come not just one way around was not lease on the land and the only one I'm gorditas Christ was on a man but remember what he said he didn't say on my son of God he said I'm a son of man rip you know one part of it revealing beasts on a man so he was identifying he was part of the Son of Man revelation he said I'm a subtle and revealing the son of am right and then now we can have the song then revelation which we'll get to later on because we gotta really understand its own God the Son of God is the Holy Spirit angel covenant and even brother Ronald said he said that same angle of covenant standing two feet from me we read it last Sunday he said that same angel that led is real children of Israel extending right beside me yes I see that's a paradox because that same man was inside of it we gave him staying beside it yeah laughter right that was a different anointing that wasn't the son of man that was the son of God son of man was Jesus Christ but to bring that son of God so close to that man he said well that was just for him sure the prophecy part the healing part on that level was all William Brennan without angel the Covenant is no less powerful today we make him less powerful because remember when that son of God went into that son of man called Jesus Christ they was things he didn't know right brother Brown said he didn't know his partner kingdom to what Moses and Elijah came in theophany you see they'd already turned back to the word they're already turned back to the word even when brother Brandon went across the curtner time they told him plane was there Nina Hawaiian was there look around little girl these people are they Brown they said no your convert and then they all said if you hadn't have come what they were telling him because they were back into their word form their theophany right man all right man now look no I don't want to i want to give you a little point2 to ponder where is that now if it's this and if it's this if you're born again that's where your fee off in the end it's in your soul does your shoulders your theophany we don't have a body hanging up in a closet somewhere to go to know we have a word a word to go to write if they surf the crabapple easily have one way what not one way there's not a way Dale standing up in the sixth dimension waiting on me to get there and I'm just an hour like this you know know if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved all I do is just I don't need to I don't need you to open the door I don't need you to open a window I'm just going to step over into the next dimension in the same what's carrying what is carrying me over there now word that I have here is what's carrying me into that sixth dimension all right so so let's not look at it as we've we've got one hanging up in a closet or know the one that's waiting is right here because if you're born again this is what's inside of you this is our whole problem we don't realize what we already have if you're born again you don't realize what you already have it's the Son of God in an ace on a man not least on man in haste on a man revealing the son of man but what's it doing it's bringing this body under subjection to what word everything goes back to the word because in the beginning was what the word all right and it's a word body that we're looking at not no no not a flesh body we had to come down to take on flesh because that's where we fell we fell in flash at a villain flash the Sun good and I hope you understand so the dog doesn't need Redemption it's like I was telling we were talked about the other day God did write all this in the Bible for us to be able to tell him what he is he knows what he is he just wrote it in there to get us to see who he already had okay so this is not a surprise that God did but like i said before you said well i don't understand it but then you need to pray because the one that wrote it the one that wrote this word if you're born again is inside of you brother brown said wait on you to bring him to what word so that he can click in it oh yeah we can read all this in the beginning was worth about probably millions of people today are in the same scripture Oh God is up in heaven and we're going to glory one day we all know him but I know Mama's up there playing a harp on a cloud you know just wait on this and you know even brother Brown had a had his limited revelation in the beginning remember he said I float my brother navel he said I couldn't shake his hand Oh baby when he went across that Carter time his revelation went up a little higher his revelation was hey there is solid as I am on this side actually they're more real than I am I'll see they're in their eternal state he was in he said I look back and see my old body land on them on the bed say they had come into a condition they had turned back into the word form they were supposed to be had he not been a fall a man yeah so it's the same way with brother Brian when all the ones that are in that seats to mention they're waiting on us because the Son of Man revelation is the one it takes a buddy chain see the Son of God revelation don't need a body chain you don't need a change but coming it through the filter of flesh the way I call them builder of flesh down to the son of man we need Redemption show that we can go back because remember Redemption is not replacement right redemption is falling from where you were eating coming around back to it alright so in the beginning was the word and I've said many times before the only way you can understand this is to have the author inside you mm-hmm okay if you write if I were to write you a book about me and James been married for 36 years and i will write you up i write you a book this thick and i headed the way him and he probably fall asleep after two chapters well that's a good book that's just that's nice but in some way i could take me that experienced it and place my spirit and william and then William reads it you read it with a whole different set of eyes right because you are experiencing that what's the same way we've done that's why people read this word and don't get one thing out of it because the author's not inside they're going that's what I say it that's what I meant that's the end between the lines say that's why i said before and i want you to see this again even if God will wrote every day every life of everybody but from the time he created man till now the book will be so big dude never be able to remember even Johnson I can't even write it in the book remind he said the volume wouldn't contain what Jesus done that never was written as a good but God knew that we 66 books is about all we can handle and we couldn't carry books this thick Sam so you put it in 66 volume 66 chapters and he said here this is my word you can carry anywhere you go Carrie there you go and this is me now what you got to do is tho you gotta read between the left you got to do the fill and the part that I really you know eat my pleasure to green my blood walk out the door he really need never explained it but now what you'd call a dude Paul with the Holy Ghost right all of the Holy Ghost and correct has explained what Jesus was saying he said he said this is my body which is broken for you this is my blood doing in remembrance of me right so Paul with what Paul had the one that wrote it inside of it the ones in the upper room I I told him before a will be finished in just a second it's a devil would have left Jesus alone see Jesus's body would have died sometime but it was a flesh body when born in sin but it was born in this sinful world right he was he looked 50 but he was 30 so don't tell me his body went aging right now his body saw and felt the effects of the curse right right if God will I mean if Satan would have left him alone that body would have died somewhere but he killed him and when he killed him 50 days later he had 121 little Jesus's that they went on the day of Pentecost so that Jesus came back at 120 people and then I want to have Jesus and he walked out and said men and brother you've killed jesus cried but if you repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ so now there's 3121 Jesus is in one day Satan was having a nervous breakdown that now what have I done and now do all down to the church ages that son of God revelation though has been God working in human flesh obviously but it was a revelation that Jesus with all my god the came and died for our sins and it will accept him as our Savior he'll give us eternal life all right but now that's not gonna get you a body chain all right that's going to put you in a grave just like it did all them down through till today till this day right here we've made several people you can see their pictures on that wall in there we very several people what they died under the revelation of the Son and God did I believe in Jesus Christ then you died for my sins that I'll have eternal life and that one day I'll come up in a resurrection but that's not the Son of Man Revelation the Son of Man revelation is I've already been changed all you look over the roulade I've already been changed God changed me inside now he's changing me outside Camille that's the Son of Man revelation the Son of God is fixing to work his way out and into that son of man so he appeared as a captain of the host remember Joshua Joshua was all worked up one day man he just won a big battle he was standing out there nice Amell we don't look them on and he sees this man coming he looks and obviously the man was dressed as a warrior because Joshua the Bible says 30 sword and said who are you are you for us are you against them he was still hyped up he was ready he was he had won a battle he said hey if you're one if you're one of the enemy and you one last one me and you know you will deal with me but when that land spoke and said oh no Joshua I'm the captain of the host Joshua heard that voice that they've been talking to me and he got down on his knees but really truly people that wasn't his Savior that men didn't save it so that was a human form that the son of my son of God stepped into to meet somebody just like he did milk as a dick and then that body went out of the distance and that man couldn't dive up and that man came into a woman there's your son of man that's the man that literally died because remember he died in the mind of God before the foundation of the world right what's that wasn't good enough he had to come down here and do it as a witness he had to die to what to release the life so that mean you that have eternal life and now we have a son of man revelation which will begin on the next Sunday a son of man revelation that no one else had this revelation all they knew we were God in human flesh they knew that God was in us but we've got to become so much to remember it was dust sample or in the Old Testament little brown said the Prophet would catch it and say the centauran well that's what somebody else said jesus never send us that for jesus said I say I say unto you and then what member brother Brown said I could never understand that scripture says you what you say to this mountain it'll be moved from seed mother brenda was a prophet he had saved us that the Lord called he caught the revelation from God and give it to us and he died somebody is not going to die but you can't save us save the Lord and live it's got to be what you say when the Bible says what you say to this mountain because your body changes don't come from inside you brother nails not going to speak your body shame but Matthews nothing speaker by the change you're going to have to speak your own body chain but now it's a revelation of what everybody that's what the powerful ministry tells you that's a revelation that's what it's going to be it's going to be the revelation it's going to be revealed to you and you only I'm not going to take a body changed on my daddy does gundo have grandchildren ain't drank it so thank you Heavenly Father for father's day number one and thank your natural father if he's still alive for poverty god bless you thank you
