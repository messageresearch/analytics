TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yes but they're not here they're traveling somewhere this weekend where are they going reunion in kentucky he's going to see his history remind me when i do this we'll change the camera all right all right revelation 6. all right all right revelation chapter 6. what we're going to do today is we're going to finish up the first seal i got a few comments i want to make afterwards but i want to let us all get the symbols right let us all get the the thought right because here's my whole point through the seals and i hope you're catching this like brother branson i hope you're catching something in this in this uh week of course this took us 20 20 little thermonets to get to this to the end of the first sale but i can't reveal the first seal to you i i don't want you people to to your brothers and sisters to to think that and it's happening and we talked about last night it's happening in the message people have made preachers in the popes you go get the word for us what they tell moses no you go get and bring it back this right here people i can't reveal this to you it's got to be like keith said this past weekend you know you've got to have preachers you got to have teachers you got to have something in school you've got to have the bible but it comes down between you and god alone brother brown says as persons communing with your creator we know it has to come to a fivefold ministry because the bible says for the perfecting the of the saints you have to have these things but then also the bible says that there need no man teach you why because the holy ghost is the teacher he's the one that come in to give you the revelation i can tell you symbols i can draw it out and i can even tell you my revelation but unless it becomes excuse me alive to you it's dead letter dead letter we got the books brother brown said in these books and takes lies rapturing faith well what else are we going to look for i'm going to read you one quote today and this is what right here let's turn now and read it it's in the first seal because brother brown even talks about you know the church being raptured what's the next great thing it's the rapture of the church paragraph 374 excuse me that's page 153 paragraph 374 educate educated this is a sacred superman with education wisdom church theology of his own words of his own making and he rides his wife denominational horse to deceive the people and he will conquer every religion of the world does everybody realize that every religion of the world not communism not not the united states not uh no no i'm trying to find one more america 401 let's go to 401. all right paragraph 401 that white horse rider has been in the in the land all the time all right so he's been he was there he just took a profit to bring it out because let's go back to let's go back to 398. because look this is what god promised if you'll remember god's promise now look paragraph 398 now notice in the same time this is going on just before this take place rather on the earth god has promised while all of them scrupled the denominations arguing their differences about their creeds god promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return to the original word of god and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the holy ghost amongst the people with a power that will raise her above these things and take her in at the same time in other words as the antichrist is coming on the scene the holy ghost is already on the scene antichrist is on the scene but what's going to happen is is the antichrist system is going to stay here and the holy ghost is going to take us out of here all right then go to 399. who is that white horse rider you're not blind you see who he is it's that antichrist and that deceitful spirit has gone on now and crept in now let's go to 401 that white horse rider has been in the land all the time he will change from antichrist he does that and becomes to a false prophet see he first started an antichrist the spirit then he became a false prophet then later when the devil is cast out he is incarnate then with the devil three stages the first he's the devil to begin with the spirit of the devil then he becomes a false prophet teacher of a false doctrine next thing he comes to the very devil himself incarnate see there he is and at the same time that this devil falls out of heaven and becomes incarnate of man the holy spirit goes up and comes down in incarnate in incarnate man amen o what a time look 490 i mean coral five let me tell you something brother i just now know for one time in my life why that spirit has always warned me against them that organization now see he cried out against all that but now remember one thing if we know the denominational systems are wrong then guess what that spirit is not deceiving us if we see it out there because brother branham came brought a message tie the loose ends together get everything ready come out of her my people so we came out of the denominational churches but now we've got to get the denominational spirit out of us all right that's where it's got to come to and i was thinking and for those of you that don't know what i'll be ministering this afternoon on a subject but when joshua went into promised land he had things he had to get to drive out even with the holy ghost but now god promised that land for them see so god promised this land our land nothing is not now just being born again that was the land that came through luther wesley pentecost you understand what i'm saying but when brother brown really brought his message it was this here the seal to change your body something to change the person and i got a quote in here but i can't find it i found it this morning i should have marked it but he says it comes down to the life and that's what it's coming down to it's coming down to the life you see all these people in the message uh preachers getting caught in adultery preachers getting caught in money problems preachers getting caught in it why satan's satan's target is us if he gets us he's got you right if he gets us sorry and just the way it is if he gets us he's got jews but if he can get the preachers because the the past teachers preachers pastors evangelists apostles or for the perfecting of the saints not making you lower than them but if he gets the first fruit because we're supposed to get it first joshua got it first and then he what he gave it to the priest we'll talk about it this afternoon but now let's go through and see and make sure that we understand at least the symbols at least what's going on in the first seal because i cannot bring you some great mighty revelation it's been preached by the prophet it's been preached by many great men brother dale's got a whole series on it and if you want to i think they got it somewhere that you can read i mean that you can listen to but let's look at this and let's make sure that we got all this correct but if you got it lined up then god can help you right what the problem is down through the ages we just like i told you about the little the little uh illustration about you know me looking at brother ray well the whole word of god is true but luther had one truth he was looking at one thing that just shall have no faith sanctification was a little bit more baptism in the holy ghost was more and why did why did brother brown put the holy spirit right here on the top of this pyramid or right here at after you get all these perches he said that sealed it together well that's what that's what we're trying to do we're trying not to just uh seal the inside of man the inside man if you're born again you're just as eternal as god is you never sinned a day in your life that's what we're talking about in a bible study last night you've got to understand the bible was written by man all right but god's word is eternal and the part he sees of you if he ever sees you sin he has to destroy you so if you're born again today he sees you sinless first john we read it last night the seed remaineth in you and you cannot sin why because you've begotten or born from that genesis 1 26 there was when god started having his children everybody understand that god created a group of people now not a group of people individuals he said let us make man in our image now if we were in the image of god that must be perfect right god's perfect so he created male and female created he them brother brown said that was in spirit form before we were even put in flesh when we start talking about multiplication we have to think a man and a woman has to get together and do what we do now that's not the way it's supposed to be spiritual multiplication is what god always wanted and that's what it's coming back to it's just we've got a flesh body now that we had to get from this earth which was cursed we've already been through that but when he said you're begotten of god that means you come from if my son josh was begotten between june and myself we begot a son but now god doesn't need a woman right that was a problem to start with true he is a male he brings forth his own so in the beginning god created all this stuff and he created male and female created he them all right then you go over to first john says you can't sin but then john says the same thing he says if you say you have no sin you're alive where are you looking at just like brother brown's quote he would say you never was born on any certain day you always was eternal what he was looking from the mind of god to you but now he'll tell you i've got one book where i marked it where this page he says you're totally sinless you can't sin you can't do anything wrong very next page you flip the page over and he said you must be born again you must come to the altar you must receive eternal life you say well the prophet's confused no he's not confused he's looking through the mind of god saying you're perfect there's nothing wrong with you at all but you've got to come back to the human part of it where brother brown looks it at the person and says your eternal life starts right here at the altar so you take so now you can take every quote and make them be perfect because it looks like he contradicts himself sometimes but remember one thing he's a prophet he looked through the eyes of god and could see a perfect complete now i call you bride your totally sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ well now that don't apply to nobody in this room that i'm looking at but it applies to everybody in this room that's born again that god's looking at so you understand how we make quotes we can say well hey you're perfect you're sinless you you've never done a you you've never had sin in your life but you're looking at me going i see him this morning well that's the human part then i can look at you and say you must be born again you need something from god you need this you need all these you need all these virtues you need a revelation but see what's the revelation got to come from though it's it's like this your sinner your inside man is the same god never did the wrong never had a bad thought never committed adultery never smoked a cigarette never i'm talking about never if there's one mark against this person you're not born again right right but it's not two people god just put his nature in here but now what's what's this over here this over here is that part of you that god's working on you must be born again you know you you must be you know taught that being born again well he didn't need 14 new births no he needed one you birth in his soul then he had to get that outside guy statue of a perfect man faith virtue knowledge but where is that that's in this guy remember the the old chief said in me is two dogs now there is two dogs see there's only one i hate to call it dog but there's only one um spirit in you when you're born and that's the nature that gets you to lie and stealing cheek do all the things but when god comes in and brother brown said burns that out vulcanized remember he used to use a little illustration about i know a lot of you don't younger people don't know what a tube is but i still remember we used to take the old cube out of the tire and you'd have to scrub it and rub it because what were you going to do you were going to take a torch and you were going to heat it or take a match and heat it put that little glue on there and smack it together and hold it there for a little while what were you doing you were making this rubber of the patch match this hole or this rubber on the tire but when they melded together if you really done it right it was stronger than the rest of the tire well that's what god did he took you and he burnt you out and then he brother brown said you and god in there together as persons but now what's he doing though he's not satisfied with that i should have done this before we started but it just came to me this morning that we may need to back up and and this is not just a symbols and it's putting it all together to me it to me it keeps it in continuity that when when god brings something to your memory you know where to find that or when the devil brings something to your memory memory you know where it's coming from see that's why brother branham when he gets on the fourth seal he names this death oh he said it was death to begin with remember we read where he said right here the white horse riders been here the whole time so the wild horse riders have been here the whole time white horse rider actually started from heaven rode right down and started riding into the people right but now in the end time there was no person and that doesn't make us any better but what i'm trying to say is our promised land is not now the baptism of the holy ghost just the baptism of the holy ghost everybody understand that it's not just that sure it's the most important thing you could do because without the holy ghost you can't go into these other realms all right but now that we have the holy ghost let's go into these other realms let's let's get the the hittites and the gurgiside you know there were seven ice in the promised land kind of strange it was seven highlights hittites jebusites gertrude sites all there were seven of them they listed them in the bible that joshua had to deal with in the promised land not before he got there in the promised land he had to deal with seven different groups of people and they all seven have different characteristics just like the seven church ages just like the seven ads when you get into the promised land we don't stop so tim and i were talking about coming home friday that's the only reason that i can see that that i know i'm born again is that i want to go on with god i want to learn more about him now if you don't want to learn more about god and if you want to not know no more than you did six months ago then you're either backslid or you're not born again one of the two you're not in a gray area you're not like brother brown said you're not almost pregnant no either you're pregnant with the word of god or you're not there's not a girl there's not a woman that's got well i'm almost pregnant no either you are you're not and what and the fruit show it shows whether you are it shows where you're not everybody understand we're all adulthood all right so the proof is in the life the proof is in the life it's going to come down to the life that you live that you allow by choice satan to do like a black dog white dog she said now in me i have a war let's go back one more time you didn't war in your members when you were the sinner sure there was little things in your life that god might say hey you shouldn't do that but you know what you overrode that and you went and did it anymore right right we all did that that's right why did we do that because there was no god residing in that place to cast that demon or dragon or red devil everywhere to cast that out so you did it but now when the holy ghost comes it it burns out that inside man gives you a new nature not in your soul a new nature because your soul is you but he gives you a new nature and begins to build brother brown said an image of the person that you are what that genesis 1 26 image god wants that genesis one image to be in your outside man outside person outside whatever you want to call it nature because you get a nature from the world that's right it's like we're talking about last night the works of the flesh the works of the flesh are not bad james says when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin is finished it brings forth death there's four stages remember brother dale priesthood a long time ago when lust is conceived there's a conception there's two things coming together that the seed being planted somewhere but if you'll take all those works of the flesh that we were talking about last night envy strife hatred listen people we all live with that we're human beings right but if we take that and let it motivate our life then what are we doing we're cutting off the holy ghost that's inside of us even born again people have envy strife sorry i said black don't want no fight cause that's the flesh you were born that like brother dale said they they you don't want to hate the person but you hate what they do all right all right you got to keep that separate but when you were a sinner you just hated the person that's right and what did you do you formulated in your mind well he's the so-and-so and he's this and that and he's of this and us and this and you still do it as a christian but maybe it's just in a cleaner form you know everybody understand what i'm talking about okay but you call people but i hope you call people things back then i hope you don't do that now all right but like timbo was asking me coming home friday he said well what about all these bad he said i get these curse words and things i said you can't help that god i wish you could let me and dad was talking about what are those dreams you have you have a dream about something just ungodly and you wonder where did that come from well look don't let that bother you cut the thing off and say satan you you rolled the ball down through my brain last night but that ball is going to roll right on out the door see because remember jesus said the prince of this world satan has come and has nothing in me what in other words he could come he's going to come most powerful scripture in the world resist the devil and he'll flee from him but if you leave him an opportunity he'll plant a seed when lust is conceived lust is not bad you understand what i mean you have to have that between your husband and wife and even like i'm telling timbo you got to be careful with that word lust because it's affection you've got to have if you see a pretty woman you want to date her what is human beings i said don't let that body but you've got to keep that separate for me if you're a clean man if you're a clean man inside it won't let you do anything dirty to that system or or the girl that you're dating but now once you're married what you thought about was okay because you've come under what you're the bible says you know let the bed not be defiled and all these things we come in and god allowed that to happen and brother brown said you and your wife should enjoy each other enjoy the things of life together because if god put you together no man on this earth is going to take you asunder you become one just like christ from the bride that's what he's that's what he's telling us to do our natural affections shouldn't get in our way of our christian life though that's what you got to watch out for all right so this is a life lib let's go through these and just look at the symbols we'll go to the second seal next sunday and start with it but like i said i can't give you a revelation of the first seal you've got to ask god to give you a revelation of what that first seal means to you but remember one thing if you're born again whatever this seal is working on is connected to your outside man did everybody understand that because the seals were given for redemption of your flesh your flesh so we can change it right so we start with a horse remember the horse with the power and the power was given by what the people all right he was given a bow with no arrows which means he was a bluff all right a crown was given him he started out as a spirit but as we get through into this third church age they actually crowned a man they brought religion and and politics together uh constantine and all those brought everything and they crowned the pope so now they actually have a head now this is not satan incarnate not yet but it's in the baby form it's beginning to start look at the catholic church read that article jim broad the catholic church is so ingrained in people's mind even our local paper wrote about a girl which is in wichita kansas but she was dying and they prayed her mom and dad prayed to jesus and some dead saints been dead 55 years and said this dead saint changed somebody's mind in heaven and this catholicism how did it happen they believed and god healed him now god said if you'll believe i'll heal you that's why the brother ryan said a prostitute can come across a platform not have anything she knows she's a sinner she knows she's done wrong but she knows that man can touch god and if that man can touch god and tell me what my problem is then i'll be healed she'll be healed christian walks up brother brown says lose their healing why they're going oh i was oh i had a bad thought yesterday we're back to this whole thing what we're talking about oh i did this wrong yesterday i did this wrong and see so it muddled their mind up and they couldn't be healed all right well this girl was healed because they prayed to jesus number one and had faith but this dead saint had nothing to do with it but look how the catholic church i mean they wrote a big article in the paper june brought us out there so you look at it so what happened is they have made these little things to become alive now see when when when it started in the first three ages i really don't think they didn't have the revelation i say they uh paul irene said martin but see paul had a revelation that something was coming the antichrist grievous wolves all that john uh irenaeus martin all those probably didn't see because remember even martin luther coming on the other side in the in the fifth age he was loyal to the vote he was loyal to the catholic church right he actually went if you'll watch the movie he went two or three times to try to talk to the pope and get him to you know to uh to see what he thought about him of course the pope didn't because he was an antichrist spirit that had now become into a person and he is giving his false teaching as a false prophet but we'll get into that a little bit more so let's just don't say let's just don't say pope i was trying to write another word up there but i quote was the only thing it came to me but um it wasn't pope john paul the first and it wasn't you understand it's a system but they got to have a head just like we have a head that which is christ all right we saw in the first seal that the christ the lamb and the holy ghost is one god that's peace brother the christ lamb the holy ghost is one person one truly living god when god was incarnate in you and i william brown whoever and you see something right off in opposition going away you know one thing's for sure a battle has been won everybody understand that a battle has been won i want you to see that every time you have a bible through virtual interpretation god brother counts all well we're going to have to start seeing that certain things are going out of our life that's like i said before if we're still if we're still struggling to should i go to church or should i not or should i stay no just come back and start on the foundation let's get born again let's do the things right let's get justified sanctified let's get filled with the holy ghost and then god can start all right because god doesn't go backwards god always goes forward if you go backwards it's the devil right so that's what brother brown was showing he said here stands alone with the book in hand there goes the wild horse rider well what happened is he saw that organizational spirit go away from it you say from a prophet we all had we all had it he said i wondered why i hated that if you'll read in the first thing i wonder why i always hated it why because it's in opposition we go back to this right here remember the remember the vision or the prophecy by danny henry he said because of the way you chose which is the hard way so brother brown made a choice to go in that direction but god knew he's going to make that choice from the foundation of the world same way with you and i through foreign but the first seal shows me that that you got to see a true revelation of one god because if you don't then you've got other persons involved okay everybody understand that you gotta when you when when you see you got father son holy ghost and they split them up and then now in the message you got jesus wasn't god to the river jordan and he became god then you got two lords you got all this separation you can't stand and brother branham was standing in a position he said here stands the lamb he didn't say there or here they stood he said here stands a lamb right here with a book in his hand in other words god had come down into that man and was beginning to teach us something that we've never heard before okay through that little prophet through the ministry the fifo ministry the same thing's got to happen but you have got to see in your life you've got to see something go out go away from you this is after you're born again not before see before you see the unclean spirit goes out and all that you can read that that's just in sanctification before you even start in your christian journey i mean we all got problems with things we all got nature that we have to deal with but if you have to fight with with being a christian um you know whether i should smoke today or whether i should go you know oh i said a bad word or or you know that should be when we get to right here you're away from that i'm telling you this is and don't get me wrong this is not a different promised land it's the same promised land but when you get the holy ghost we need to step over and we'll we'll read it to this afternoon where once they got in the promised land there was something happen to a group of people that sanctified them for the journey in the promised land okay so christ the lamb and the holy ghost same person one god get a revelation of one true and living god if you do get a revelation one true and living god you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ well that tells you one true living god right so if you've got to follow some holy ghost baptism you've got different persons that's right so you're not standing here in this position so let's go back let's go back and get that right see look at all the years i'm not gonna get finished maybe but and all those years look at where from from jesus's ascension in ab30 until now has been two thousand years basically two thousand years it took two thousand years to get it back to where where he was standing on the earth as far as doctrinally correct does everybody understand that one true living god water baptism named lord jesus christ no eternal hell all the things that we have become indoctrinated all the way up through the ages it took us that 2 000 years and basically it took us all an average of 10 or 12 years or 20 years or 30 years or 40 years ever how long you've been in a message or been born again to come to a place where you really know there's one god where you really understand that you're not praying to jesus who prays to the father i mean your friend not praying to the holy ghost who's praying to jesus who's praying to the father that's catholicism that's three separate individual things you're doing just like the the with the catholic priest they had to put that priest in there because he's an intercessor well jesus christ is the only intercessor we need all right but christ lamb holy ghost all these are titles to one god all right so we must see that now the combat beast that said come and see that was a lion l-i-o-n lion it was a lion brother brown said it was bold it was in that first church age second church age third church age they were bold look at them all the disciples were killed except for john for what they preached all right they were uh saw asunder they were pulled apart they were drugged through the streets they were crucified upside down and all those things but they held true first second third age but what happened that third age ended at 606 a.d that was the last night the encounter where they came up with the father son holy ghost baptism and that jesus was a light substance of god not the substance of god and it's kind of strange we've come right back to another night seeing council in 2000 about six when they started that river jordan doctrine 2006 7 somewhere in there that jesus wasn't gone to the river jordan what is that different personality a different identity we'll go back to 606 and read that and i see in council jesus was a like substance of god not the substance of god's same way now they're separating them two lords look brother brown said that scripture always right and remember what i told you that white horse didn't die when he got off of it and got on the black horse or the red horse it just kept right that that idea kept riding in the people and i can see more now than ever how that thing's building on top of each other white red black and then pale all right that was the first three church ages and the wicked one was is being made known and that's what's gonna happen in the end time satan hid himself in denominations he's hid himself and follows unholy those baptisms he hid himself in all these different things but when that prophet came on the scene and he started putting that word together got us back to one true and living god then we can see that anything in opposition to that one true living god and that one true word of god is false it's like we were talking last night now in the end times one word off your antichrist one word you say well i can't do it well you just made your own choice i'm just going to believe as long as i'm alive brother as long as i'm alive that i'm going to choose to be one of them that's going to take a change right i'm just and i'm going to make myself available you can't just say that and then go sit home that's right you can't just say that and then say well i'm i'm done finished i'm gonna sell my books and i'm just no you ain't packed up ready to go up yet all right we're packing we're not packed up we're packing we're packing it in because one day you know we may not be able to do this we might be so separated but you know what god said i'll bring things to your remembrance whatsoever i have taught you that's why somebody bro tim asked me we'll get ready to go both tim asked me he said you said something about abraham being in the wrong place and he missed melchizedek brother branham said read it i'm looking for the quote couldn't find it because you got to get the wording right but he said if you're not in church that may be the very day that god comes by to speak to you and you're not there right wow that means you missed it brother brown said many times he'd call out people in the congregation he said sister you're missing it why because she didn't realize it was for her right i read the other day said sister you missed that but maybe he'll come back and and then he watched the angel would come down he said quickly stand up quickly accept it he said because you'll move on that's the same way with you and i and i don't mean to come to church every service but you ought to be here every service that you can you want to listen you ought to pray because one day god may turn around to you and say the reason you didn't make a change is because of xyz whatever you want to call it wrong right wrong place at the wrong time be at the bus station and have a train ticket you know you don't want to do that you want to be where the word of god is all right so that's the first seal um next sunday if you have any questions about the first seal we'll take the first 10 or 15 minutes and then we'll kind of do a review on the second seal so lord bless you go get out of here
