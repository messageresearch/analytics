========================================

my turn today myself it is uh speak to the Rock and I'm going to use two scriptures I've got more scriptures but these are the ones that we're going to read out the Bible when when God said Moses to take his people out of Egypt uh two and a half million people on it too made it to the promised land because of their unbelieved Joshua and Caleb now here's what he's gonna hurt the other day so brother Brown said Egypt is a type of the world they said we can't leave this message they said at least in Egypt we had here goes makeup pants scissors they also have football it's all right throw that one in there you see they weren't ready for the journey so are we ready for the tournament let's read our scriptures numbers 20 1 to 12 1-12 foreign into the deserts of Zion in the first month and the people of voted and Miriam died there and was buried there and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron people both osmosis and speak and saying would God that we had died when our brother died before the Lord why have you brought up the congregation of the Lord and to the Wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and wherefore have you made us to come out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place it is no place a seed or a figs or a vines or pomegranates either is there any water to drink and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces in the glory of the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord respect unto Moses and says saying this is what God told Moses to do take the rod and gather the assembly together in Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock speak ye unto the Rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rocks of that shall give the congregation in their BEAST's dream and Moses took the rod from him before the Lord as he commanded and Moses and Aaron gather the congregation together for the Rock and he said he said unto them hear me hear now he Rebels must we fetch you we're out of water of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smoked the rock twice that's what it did twice and the water came out of that abundantly and the congregation drank and their Beast also and there are spec onto Moses and Air because you believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you should not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them now what did Moses do he uh he traded that promised land for a moment of anger in the bottom of the numbers 20 Scorpio says The Rock Christ as First Corinthians 4 Once meeting knits needs not to be it's made in crucified again but an end time will prior crucified by rejecting his word but it cannot be crucified once said Moses acted exalted himself and imply entitled The One sacrifice wasn't in in future does deny the eternally I think shave I don't know other blood the Abundant water Grace reaching the meet other people despite the error of the leader tells a refreshing and power through the spirit okay let's go to uh part of the scripture First Corinthians 10 1-4 he said moreover brother I would not let you be ignorant that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and Aaron we're all baptizing to Moses and the cloud and in the sea and they all eat the same spiritual meat and did our drinkers same spiritual drink before they drink of that spiritual rock that follow them and that rock was Christ by many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness thank you in the message speak to the July 23 23rd 1960 brother mom said he said it must have been a hard morning everybody was all confused and frustrated because I said all night long the cattle had behold and the children cried and the people had fussed and argue and quarrel he said poor Moses it was a dreadful time for him you see he had come down into Egypt and had brought the children according to the purpose of God and was leading them to the promised land said Atlanta along with milk and honey was a promise of God to protect them and to supply everything they had need of until they reached this glorious land flowing with milk and honey said Moses and God called servant or named Prophet Pillar of Fire over him follow him confirming the words that he spoke the signs and wandered on his road to the promised land with the children a very definite type rather of a journey today we're on a road to the promised land and we are being led by the great Holy Spirit as it was led and natural we are LED in the spiritual to this great promised land that God made the promise and gave to us God had promised there God had promised them to supply all their needs that their final Minds had taken them out of the Divine will of God and gave them a desert route same message you say about what carnal laws began to come along them it finally drove them off the main path into the desert said they made their fatal mistake when they failed to go on they were on the journey not very much many miles they could have made it in a few days that all that is two million people out into the desert if they stayed on the path but when they came to a place called queries at one time I was called a great judgment seat it was a great spring or well there were many little whales he said a perfect type of the church and the church is the Judgment seat where Heaven is a great Judgment of sea of God and the little Wells represent the little churches all oh a judgment begins at the house of God how many how many times did President talks about that he said now they make their fatal mistake when they began to murmur against Moses and against God's servants and against God and it bypassed them and remember every one of them that murmur never went over into the land he said Jesus said when he was on Earth your father's deity man I am the Wilderness but there are everyone dead here's what they've done they left the garlic pots in Egypt to eat Angels food and was complaining you could think of it you see you see then also they had left the Muddy Waters of Egypt to drink from that spiritual Rock so still complaining about it they had left the boasting Physicians of Egypt that boosted how great they were to be with a great precision that there wasn't even their clothes they didn't there wasn't a few one among them they they come from the Wilderness still complaining this ain't out of the message I just got this from Summer he says that don't complain about torns Among Roses but be grateful for Roses among the poem he said now we find that they they seen those Miracles look what was with them they had a smitten rock with them they could drink from it they had a breast serpent with them for healing oh my they had a prophet with them that had the word of God over the prophet was a pillar of fire it was due doing the leading and not one time had it ever failed them it hadn't failed God doesn't fail he cannot fall fail and remain God he's still God the smitten Rob the breast serpent the prophet and atonement is sacrifice everything Grace had provided for them already and afterward afterwards God had done all these things they were like a lot of people today there has to be babied around god um God doesn't want babies God wants man and women out of the message that ever pressed some water from the Rock brother but I said it was July 23 1961 . he said in this Exodus they were given a spiritual leader which was Moses a great unknown that Prophet that was a great man he was a godly man he was warning godly man God called him from his mother even before that time God ordained him before the foundation of the world to be the leader to that generation to bring this Exodus to the people now when they were down in Egypt and God sent Moses he stretched forth the rod and fleas and lies came on the ground he stretched forth towards the Sun and then it went down he stressed it over the waters and it turned to blood he said what Israel was over in Canaan over in Goshen just having a glorious time he said the Sun never went down the place never struck them well they were just having a glorious time said and that's the way Israel was supposed to be but it became bored some he said all this old light bread and Angels bread well what what do we care about this old library and everything is wrong and it's all manner that falls out of every night why we would rather have some garlic and leeks on Egypt you see their hearts wasn't ready for their Journey I never knew what leaks were too sort of the Cooking Channel the other day looks like a onion or something it's all right uh you said it now we find out that I'm on this road after they got like that this they came to a place uh parrot hair then we find out he said let's break it down then the name down that's where the name Hera means a dry place or a desert he said in order to get these people to some water after they got over there this dry place was made at Calvary and there God told Moses he said take the rod and the elders and go forth and I will stand under on that rock before you and this rock was Christ and Moses with a rod that he had brought judgment upon the nation of Israel took the same rod and spoke the judgments of God upon the rock he said see he took the sins of the people into this wrath which he should have spoke with the people instead of smiling them the people who smoked The Rock and they rocked through the work of God brought salvation brought water to perishing people he brought life to a dying people and that's what God did by taking his one of judgment right and one thing my sins and your sins around this world when he should have struck us but he struck Christ that from him come forth Waters which means Spirit the Holy Spirit came from him to give us life now we have eternal life now that rock was Christ he said uh some people has it upon their their hearts and mind that all Israel drank and then they packed up and the camel's name their pictures on their horses and so forth and took their kids and journey on into somewhere else and left the rock they're sprinkling he said that's wrong that rock followed them and that waterfall of them didn't say what we saw in First Corinthians 10. I believe that 11 verse he can find it that Brock would follow Israel wherever they went from that day and Sport The Rock went with him and the waters followed him see that rock follow Israel they never followed Iraq but the rock followed them Israel went on their Journey they had put they had by one thing to do let's keep this straight course right straight on to the promised land and that rock and the water follow them he said God took the judgments of the people and placed them upon Christ and smoking did you notice there was a clap in the Rock from then on the Rock had a clap in it where Moses smokes and Christ had a cleft he was smitten he was wounded for a transgression and with his stripe we were healed from their life come forth that it Waters our life that we so enjoyed he said the Bible says that Waters follow the children of Israel when they got thirsty they knew the water was near I'm going back to the speaking to the Rock he said if you need nice big to the Rock if you need Joy speak to the Rock if you need healing speak to the Rock if you need the Holy Ghost speak to the Lord he said whatever you need to the Rock he'll bring forth his water if you believe that he said what the church needs today is get back on a speaking term with Iraq the Rock of Ages Christ Jesus God's men wrath that's God's Rock he said it's salvation of God they're still our commandment today is the name of the Rock and God will bring forth this his water out of the Rock in New Mexico uh I don't want to say where but where to make them bombs I don't want to say uh I find out that that they had a treaty with like Russia and China and other countries they can only supposed to have so many nuclear bombs now it was almost there what they're doing is there this disassembling The Palms not making fun so you think other countries are going to be doing the same thing no so brother Brian I said when the bombs start dropping there's only one shelter we have and that is in Jesus Christ so but if you're a son or daughter of God and say if you're not a little ego because Jehovah evil will hide us on the cleft of the rock where nothing can harm us I like that song by The George sings I think they sang Nick last week says that he hired my soul he said he hired my soul in the cleft of The Rock their Shadows that drive thirsty land he hired in my life in the depth of his love and covers me there with his hands yeah Jesus talking to the woman at the well in John 4 13-14 Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinked it up as water shall thirst again never thirst but the water that shall give him shall be in him and well the waters bringing up into everlasting life Exodus 33 20-22 and he said thou cannot see my face but they're shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and not shall stand upon a rock all right and it shall come to pass for my glory past that I will put it in a cleft of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I passed I guess that's where they got that song Psalms 18 2 the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my mother and the horn are my salvation and my high tower Psalms 105 38 for 1. he said Egypt was glad when they deported for the fear of them fell upon them he spread a clout for a cover and it's hard to give life in the night the people asked and he brought whales and satisfy them with the Bread of Heaven he opened the Rock and The Waters passed out and they ran and they dry in dry places like the river Psalm 78 15 16. declared the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the Great deeps he brought them streams also out of the Rock and costs Waters to run down like Rivers anybody has any questions or comments or fire behind him yeah I just caught something which I never cut before when the Lord told Moses to speak to the Rock he smelled it but did he do it as a symbol when you read father speak to the Rock president said that's why God was too slide us but he smoked Christ is that and yeah like a type of it because I think Moses made a mistake well there's another scripture where it says wait till Smite The Rock but there's two different scriptures but I kind of went with this one because uh you can only crucify Christ once you know he can't crucify him again I mean we can crucify like I said rejecting his word but yeah okay thank you thank you
