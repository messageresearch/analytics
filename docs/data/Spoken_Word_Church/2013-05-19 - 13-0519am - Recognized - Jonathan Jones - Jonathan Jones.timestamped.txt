[2:59] yes it should be all of our desires
[3:01] right right amen
[3:03] and one day we will he gave us a promise
[3:05] he gave us a word
[3:08] first Samuel this morning chapter 16.
[3:14] we'll speak on David this morning but I
[3:17] titled it recognized
[3:19] we got to recognize Who We Are
[3:22] amen first off we got to recognize that
[3:24] we need him
[3:26] but I thought the oldest message come to
[3:28] me and and it just kind of
[3:32] you really encouraged me
[3:34] so I look forward to maybe encourage
[3:36] y'all this morning
[3:37] uh I know along the way the battles are
[3:40] tough
[3:41] we need encouraging
[3:43] and we need to realize Who We Are
[3:46] right and we need to realize that he's
[3:48] on our side
[3:49] and and as we as we look at David here
[3:52] you can say David knew who he was yeah
[3:55] David recognized in the scripture who he
[3:57] was
[3:58] and uh so we'll take him this morning
[4:00] but uh first Samuel chapter 16 start
[4:04] reading in verse 5.
[4:06] and he said Peace boy I come to you to
[4:08] sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify
[4:10] yourselves and come with me
[4:13] to the sacrifice and he Sanctified yes
[4:15] and his sons and he called them to the
[4:17] sacrifice
[4:18] and it came to pass when they had come
[4:20] that he looked upon Elam and he said
[4:23] surely the Lord's anointed is before him
[4:27] verse 7 says but the Lord said unto
[4:30] Samuel look not at his countenance
[4:33] nor his height or a statue
[4:36] because I refused him right right for
[4:38] the Lord seeth not as man saith
[4:42] and for man looketh on the outward
[4:44] appearance
[4:45] but the Lord looketh on the heart and I
[4:48] thought of that scripture itself I
[4:49] thought a little God
[4:51] look at us we can always point to that
[4:54] brother being a better minister or that
[4:56] person can sing better than I can or
[4:58] that person lives better God's not
[4:59] looking at that it's looking at your
[5:01] heart he's looking at your character
[5:03] and he goes on down and says then Jesse
[5:05] and called Adrian I mean go on down and
[5:07] goes through each one of the sons
[5:09] verse 11 said in Samuel said unto Jesse
[5:12] or hear all thy children
[5:15] and he said they remaineth yet the
[5:17] youngest and behold he keepeth the Sheep
[5:21] and Samuel said unto Jesse sin and fetch
[5:23] him so we're not set down until he come
[5:25] hither
[5:27] and he sinned and he brought him in now
[5:29] he was ready and without a beautiful
[5:31] countenance and goodly look upon them
[5:33] and the Lord said I Rise and anoint him
[5:36] for this is he
[5:38] then Samuel took the Horn of all and
[5:40] anointed him in the midst of the
[5:41] brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[5:43] Upon David from that day forward right
[5:46] if you read the texts said the Holy
[5:49] Spirit come upon David
[5:51] and I thought of the scripture there and
[5:52] he says from that day forward
[5:55] it didn't leave him when he failed it
[5:59] didn't leave him when he went through
[6:00] hard times it didn't leave him when he
[6:02] went through the valley it didn't leave
[6:04] him when he went through battles it was
[6:06] with him from then on right and if we
[6:08] believe that same God lives today he's
[6:10] with us
[6:11] right when we're in our Hard Times
[6:12] exactly we're in our battles right when
[6:16] we're faced up against the wall that we
[6:17] don't see tomorrow he's there with us
[6:19] he's laying there amongst us you know
[6:21] the the story of the footsteps Prince of
[6:23] the sands of time he says why did you
[6:25] leave me in the hardest times and he
[6:27] said son I didn't I carried you
[6:29] I carried you to say what a prayer
[6:32] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[6:34] Lord Jesus come over lord
[6:37] move me out of the way Lord Jesus say
[6:39] something Lord to be an encouragement
[6:40] Lord bless us in some way touch your
[6:43] word to the to our hearts Lord then we
[6:46] may go from here Lord and rejoice in
[6:48] your name we pray amen
[6:50] amen seated
[6:52] and I thought of this text and I thought
[6:54] of David here and I thought of the
[6:56] scripture we read there and and I'm sure
[6:58] of Samuel and and Jesse both looked at
[7:02] the sons and thought this is he this is
[7:04] he look at him he stands six foot five
[7:07] in the Statue he's got Square shoulders
[7:09] he's a man's man
[7:11] but God didn't look upon that and I look
[7:14] at all of us and I look and I think you
[7:16] know we can look even in the
[7:17] denomination around we can look at your
[7:19] your H.H Richards and we can look at you
[7:21] Billy grahams and all the mighty things
[7:24] they can do but God didn't choose them
[7:26] right he chose you
[7:29] and he chose you and I heard a brother
[7:30] say this one time in Genesis he says God
[7:33] said let there be light and there was
[7:36] light
[7:36] and they never went back and had to
[7:38] adjust it to make it perfect right when
[7:41] he spoke it it was so right right and so
[7:44] when God spoke you he don't have to work
[7:46] on you right he spoke you as a child of
[7:48] daughter of God you just have to
[7:50] recognize who you are amen because he's
[7:52] done spoken his word and said who you
[7:54] are
[7:54] but we got to recognize who we are and I
[7:58] think of David here and if we don't down
[7:59] the scripture you know we know the story
[8:02] of how the anointing come upon David and
[8:04] then Saul himself picked David
[8:07] to play to him to sense that evil spirit
[8:10] and I thought you know here's Saul the
[8:11] Bible says the spirit of God left Saul
[8:14] and an evil spirit come upon us all and
[8:16] I thought of that and I thought yeah and
[8:18] here he is what did he do he turned and
[8:21] he looked for that anointing back
[8:23] because he knew that anointing comforted
[8:25] him and even though he didn't have it he
[8:27] knew that anointing and I think of you
[8:29] and I you get a born-again experience
[8:32] everybody likes to be around you they
[8:34] may not agree with you but they like to
[8:35] be around you because you bring an
[8:37] anointing with you you recognize that
[8:39] you can change that atmosphere so I
[8:42] thought of David here and David goes on
[8:43] down and we we know the story of David
[8:46] and Goliath but I look at David and I
[8:48] think here's David and he goes through
[8:50] the batter of the bear on the Battle of
[8:52] The Lion and the battle of the all of
[8:54] this and he comes down he says who is
[8:56] this right it's just another Temptation
[9:00] right it's just another fight and I look
[9:03] at us now what's our fights watch out
[9:05] battles right right it's it's not in the
[9:07] it's it's not a lion no more we don't
[9:10] live in the jungle we don't have Lions
[9:11] roaming too and fro we don't have a
[9:13] Goliath to come against us
[9:15] but look at the trials that face us
[9:17] every day
[9:18] what's the things that touches us what's
[9:20] the what's the Temptations take take
[9:23] your sling right and kill that rise up
[9:27] against that and I thought of that and I
[9:29] thought here it is brother we're going
[9:30] to preached a message perfect strength
[9:32] and perfect weakness
[9:33] and he says now what was it now he was
[9:36] David was the most unlearned one of the
[9:38] much
[9:39] he had no schooling of fighting he had
[9:42] nothing no no nothing about it so he had
[9:45] no schooling for none of this battle
[9:46] that was set before him but he
[9:48] recognized that there was a God and he
[9:52] took the weakest thing
[9:54] they had Spears armors bows and
[9:56] everything else and David took a little
[9:58] slingshot right
[9:59] with a rock in it
[10:01] but see he knowed he could try he know
[10:04] who he could trust him or what he could
[10:06] trust in he confessed his weakness but
[10:08] his faith in God and I think of David
[10:10] his brother was explaining him here the
[10:13] most ill litter one when it come to
[10:14] fighting it'd been like it'd been like
[10:17] in my day if I would have tried to get
[10:19] in the ring with a Mike Tyson
[10:21] it wouldn't have worked this guy knew
[10:23] what he was doing
[10:24] and I don't know the first thing about
[10:26] holding my fist up yeah but here David
[10:29] David didn't look at that David didn't
[10:31] look at the circumstances sitting before
[10:33] him David didn't look at the Goliath and
[10:34] how big he was David recognized who he
[10:36] was David recognized that he had been
[10:39] anointed by the by the prophet he had
[10:41] been anointed by the prophet with the
[10:43] Holy Spirit and descended upon him come
[10:45] upon him and he knew that he was going
[10:46] to be a king
[10:48] and he knew that if he was going to be a
[10:50] king that Goliath couldn't touch him
[10:51] because he had to live through that
[10:53] stance and he looked at that and he
[10:55] thought what is this man he's coming
[10:57] against my God right my God's delivered
[11:00] me from the bear my God still living me
[11:01] from the line he'll deliver me from this
[11:03] man
[11:04] and then if we read down in the
[11:05] Scripture it takes him and Saul takes
[11:07] him in and tries to armor him with
[11:09] breasts tries to put away put a put a
[11:11] shield on and put a helmet on and give
[11:13] him a give him a sword and he says I
[11:15] don't want this
[11:16] I don't know this
[11:19] and I think of you and I what do we do
[11:21] so many times God gives us his word
[11:24] and then we try to put science involved
[11:26] with it
[11:27] then we try to put our abilities
[11:28] involved with it well you know I think
[11:30] God would want me to do this because I'm
[11:32] better at this than no maybe God wants
[11:34] to train you over here
[11:35] maybe maybe you don't realize that that
[11:38] you know David wasn't a fighter
[11:41] but yet in the Bible
[11:44] is one of the greatest stories told was
[11:45] his fight
[11:47] and I looked at that and I thought look
[11:50] at my life how do I treat God
[11:53] do I really recognize who I am
[11:57] each one of us
[11:59] do we really recognize Who We Are
[12:03] and he says all he wanted he said is I
[12:06] got my trust in God
[12:08] and here I go
[12:11] he didn't worry about the outcome he
[12:13] didn't worry about the circumstances he
[12:14] didn't worry about what was around him
[12:16] David says I got my trusting God
[12:19] and here I go
[12:21] and you know what that's where we was
[12:22] you know we spoke last night but that's
[12:24] the way we was we come to the altar when
[12:26] we first come from The Altar and we got
[12:28] baptized we're on fire from God it don't
[12:30] matter you stop at everybody you see and
[12:32] tell them about God you don't think
[12:34] about why you shouldn't you don't think
[12:36] about why I couldn't you don't think why
[12:38] it's not possible you step
[12:40] right but now as time goes on we start
[12:44] backing off that
[12:46] we need to fully recognize who he was he
[12:49] goes That's it the giant went down
[12:50] that's right
[12:51] that's what we need today brother we
[12:53] need today men like David not University
[12:56] experiences
[12:58] and I thought of that and I thought you
[12:59] know brother Brennan wasn't preaching
[13:01] against education but he's preaching
[13:03] what it would do to you
[13:04] right he's preaching what it would do to
[13:06] you
[13:06] so you got to recognize there is a God
[13:08] Amen right if you can't recognize there
[13:11] is a God you can't go no further
[13:13] you recognize there is a God and you
[13:15] know you look at nature itself if that
[13:17] don't tell you there's a God
[13:20] you know if they don't tell you that
[13:22] this is one of the songs I enjoy so much
[13:24] as the song says who told the sea that
[13:28] it could only come this far right
[13:31] right who told the winds to only blow
[13:33] this direction
[13:35] who told the rain to only Reign for so
[13:37] long and move on
[13:39] hold all this
[13:40] God's in control
[13:42] and you got to recognize
[13:44] where you were
[13:46] in your walk with God exactly
[13:48] so many times we put ourselves higher
[13:50] than we really are
[13:52] so many times we put ourselves lower
[13:54] than we really are
[13:56] you're a child of God you have every
[13:58] asset behind you
[14:01] that God is that God has himself
[14:04] you have to recognize you need help
[14:07] before you can receive it right
[14:10] so many times we come to church and we
[14:12] sit in church and and we're like the we
[14:15] like the brothers here of David we look
[14:17] the part
[14:18] we seem the part we sing well we praise
[14:22] well but then on the inside of the
[14:24] inside God's not moving and I look at
[14:27] these things and I question myself and I
[14:29] question God and I said God why this
[14:32] and I hear God tell me he says the
[14:35] Revival
[14:36] is in my elect
[14:38] it's not in the world
[14:39] and we need a stirring up in ourself we
[14:42] need a rededication in our self we need
[14:45] to come back and focus on where God's
[14:47] brought us from and where he's trying to
[14:49] take us
[14:50] and I even here first of all you know
[14:52] David didn't want the advanced weapery
[14:55] Advanced weaponry
[14:57] you know and I think in today's day you
[14:59] know that'd be a you know that'd be
[15:00] whatever the new and latest bomb is
[15:03] David didn't want that he just wanted
[15:05] God right
[15:06] such a humble heart he just wanted God
[15:09] he didn't want the fame to come with it
[15:12] he tried to give it to somebody else he
[15:14] said want somebody else fighting won't
[15:16] somebody want one of your brothers come
[15:18] on why y'all gonna beat him
[15:20] but God called him to that
[15:22] and he had to recognize that
[15:25] recognize there was a God he was a Son
[15:27] of God and did not slow him down just
[15:29] because everyone else doubted he knew
[15:32] God had moved before would move again
[15:36] you know everybody around him at the
[15:37] time I see I see him in the scripture
[15:39] here and I know we can read through the
[15:41] scripture and I see David here and and
[15:43] David comes in and they're all calling
[15:46] him a fool
[15:47] what are you talking like this for you
[15:49] can't you can't do nothing but you're
[15:51] just you're just a little runny old boy
[15:53] I don't know what you're up against
[15:54] we'll train military men we're trained
[15:57] in the ways of warfare we know look at
[15:59] that what we're facing
[16:01] look at that what we're facing you can't
[16:03] do anything with that
[16:06] he turns around he says but my God has
[16:08] and my God will continue
[16:11] so many times we need to look back at
[16:12] what God's did for us so many times we
[16:15] need to look back that I was a drunk I
[16:17] was a sinner I was I was a smokaholic I
[16:20] was a prostitute I was a what did God
[16:22] bring me from to get me to hear and now
[16:25] that he's got me here he can continue
[16:27] moving me on to that Perfect Bride hey
[16:29] look at that and he says why do we doubt
[16:32] God now
[16:34] I look in my life I was talking about
[16:35] Samuel last night I have two brothers
[16:37] that I Love Flesh brothers that I love
[16:39] with everything in me raised in the same
[16:41] house raised unto the same Pastor on
[16:44] message pews the same way I was raised
[16:46] all their life now both of them's mixed
[16:49] up in the marriage kids by other people
[16:51] don't even live together doing that why
[16:54] not me why not me look what God saved me
[16:58] from right look what God saved me from
[17:00] look what God saved you from his grace
[17:03] his Mercy is the only reason I stand
[17:05] there his grace and his mercies the only
[17:08] reason why I can stand and say that I'm
[17:11] a Child of God
[17:12] his grace his Mercy allows me to forget
[17:16] my past and realize that he forgave and
[17:19] forgotten
[17:20] and there if he can do that how much
[17:22] more can he do with me how much more can
[17:25] he do with me if I truly humble myself
[17:27] and getting me out of the way
[17:29] what can he do with me
[17:31] what can he do with you
[17:34] you don't have to be as preacher you
[17:35] don't have to be a speaker you don't
[17:37] have to be a singer you don't have to be
[17:38] a musician what can God do with you if
[17:41] you'll let him do that what can God do
[17:44] with you and I look in judges 33 and 31
[17:47] and it speaks on shamgar and after him
[17:49] was Shem gar the son of April which slew
[17:51] the Philistine 600 men with an ox code
[17:54] and then also delivered Israel right
[17:57] shamgar wasn't a preacher
[18:00] shamgar wasn't a singer
[18:02] shamgar was just trying to try to make a
[18:04] living for his family right
[18:06] shamgar was slaving in the fields
[18:08] working hard as he could trying to feed
[18:09] his family
[18:10] what was he upset about he was upset
[18:12] about the Philistines coming and taking
[18:14] his food
[18:15] he was upset about the Philistines
[18:16] taking him and took what he worked for
[18:21] it but he finally stood up
[18:23] when did he stood up he stood up when he
[18:25] recognized who he was he stood up when
[18:28] he recognized that he was a seed of God
[18:31] he recognized that you know what them
[18:33] Philistines can't overcome me they can't
[18:36] overcome what's in me well if I say
[18:38] greater is he that send me the heathe in
[18:40] the world he can't come over me I want
[18:42] to stand up for what I believe in and so
[18:45] many of us in this day and time it's so
[18:47] easy the world's falling apart around us
[18:49] the pressure is coming down on the bride
[18:51] so hard it's so easy to go well I I go
[18:55] to church there but that's it yeah
[18:57] don't stand for what you believe in
[18:59] think God's going to bless you when
[19:01] you're a coward you think God's going to
[19:03] bless you when you turn your back on him
[19:05] God's only going to bless you when you
[19:07] stand for him
[19:09] how long how many years did how many
[19:11] years did brother say one time that he
[19:13] took this from the Philistines they kept
[19:15] coming in year after year and taking
[19:17] what was his they kept coming
[19:19] and God standing by that shamgar if
[19:21] you'll stand up I'll be there Jim Garf
[19:24] you'll stand up
[19:25] how many of us is the same way is he
[19:27] telling us the same thing brother and
[19:29] sister if you'll stand up in that
[19:31] situation I'll be there
[19:32] brother and sister they're one that's
[19:34] putting you through that trial at work
[19:35] I'll be there for you but stand for my
[19:38] name stand for my name stand like sham
[19:41] guard did stand up and say that enough
[19:42] is enough
[19:44] this is my god this is my family this is
[19:46] my family's food and I'm standing for it
[19:49] but it's so easy to take the easy Road
[19:53] if you ever get a true revelation
[19:56] of Who You Are
[19:57] you're not going to be kicked around
[20:00] you're not going to be pushed around
[20:02] you're not going to take it from your
[20:04] from your employer you're not going to
[20:05] take it from your boss you're not going
[20:06] to take it from your family other
[20:08] brother home I made a statement it's
[20:10] Wednesday night and he says we do so
[20:12] much out of our way
[20:13] for everybody else and not for God
[20:17] and I thought of that and I thought you
[20:19] know how powerful that is because what
[20:21] do we do for for for our kids school
[20:25] they don't even believe the same God we
[20:27] believe in
[20:28] how much do we go out of the way and
[20:30] cost us money and time to help them
[20:34] not that it's wrong to have them
[20:36] how much money and time do we spend
[20:38] watching them watching our kids play
[20:40] sports how much time do we watch our
[20:42] kids play in the band do this do that do
[20:45] this we run to and fro how much time do
[20:48] we give God
[20:50] how much time did we give God and I
[20:52] thought of that in my own life and I try
[20:54] to take it to me first and my family and
[20:56] I think what
[20:57] what's wrong
[20:59] what's wrong with me
[21:01] because I can so easily get caught up
[21:05] and forget who gave it all to me
[21:08] because without him I'd be where my
[21:10] brothers are
[21:11] I'd be in a mixed up mess
[21:13] laying in sin somewhere without God
[21:16] right but his grace
[21:18] his Mercy
[21:20] kept me from that
[21:22] and if God's did that for you how much
[21:24] more is he wanting to do for you
[21:26] I look at the prophet's life and the
[21:28] prophet said the world went come in the
[21:29] tree and he said don't smoke before I
[21:31] could defile your body in any way
[21:33] well he had to be there to help him
[21:35] through every bit of it but he had I
[21:37] mean he had an end time of what he
[21:39] wanted him to do and the reason why he
[21:41] had to keep him from that because he had
[21:43] a gift to be a prophet and he had a
[21:45] message to bring and he wanted a clean
[21:46] vessel to bring it in
[21:48] how much more of any of us
[21:50] he said what brother what brother
[21:52] brother I've already did this but God
[21:53] brought you from it
[21:55] God brought you out of it and when he
[21:57] brought you out of it he forgave you and
[22:00] when he forgave you he put you up on a
[22:01] rock and he said here you are now you're
[22:03] now my son
[22:04] and now I love you
[22:07] I've always loved you
[22:09] but now you recognize where that love is
[22:12] in 62 convinced and concerned and that's
[22:15] one one of my one of my messages I
[22:17] really love
[22:18] he said if you can be convinced
[22:20] that God takes a hold of you shakes your
[22:23] heart makes you a new creature in Christ
[22:25] Jesus let sickness and death or anything
[22:29] else come along you're convinced
[22:32] he can take good care of you
[22:34] right sure amen I like that
[22:37] shamgar the little fella we talked about
[22:39] the other night he was concerned about
[22:41] his family yes he knowed they was hungry
[22:44] and the Philistines come in a thousand
[22:46] men I believe 600 men something I
[22:49] believe 600 of them come up with armed
[22:51] men and he was convinced concerned about
[22:53] his family because they had starved to
[22:55] death that winter but he stayed there
[22:58] thinking and studying what could he do
[23:02] he stayed there until he was convinced
[23:05] that God keeps his promise
[23:08] and I thought of another place where
[23:10] brother Brandon went on and he talked
[23:12] about how we got to have this and this
[23:13] and this and line and he says they used
[23:15] to pray for ten days
[23:18] and then they was convinced that it was
[23:20] God
[23:21] and I thought of us how long have we
[23:23] we've lost our prayer life
[23:26] we've lost it and why we lost it we've
[23:29] lost it because we've lost
[23:33] we're not really convinced that it works
[23:35] right
[23:37] because you know if I was convinced that
[23:40] I could run to that back door and run
[23:41] back and I'd lose 10 pounds I'd do it
[23:43] three or four times
[23:48] it would help
[23:51] but what do we do
[23:53] we know we say Prayer Changes Things
[23:59] but then do we pray enough right
[24:01] right and I thought of that's what he
[24:04] said there and he says he stayed there
[24:06] until he was convinced he didn't say how
[24:07] long he stayed there
[24:09] it may have been two or three years
[24:11] before he was convinced we need to stay
[24:14] there we need to when we come to the
[24:15] altar to forgive we need to stay there
[24:17] until we're convinced God's changed us
[24:19] if you're not if you're not just exactly
[24:21] right with God and you're sitting here
[24:23] thinking well you're not talking about
[24:24] me because I need save well you know it
[24:26] works the same way with salvation
[24:28] if you need saved you need to find that
[24:30] Altar and you need to stay there until
[24:32] you're convinced
[24:33] and then once you're convinced then God
[24:35] will show you who you are then you can
[24:37] recognize what he's trying to do for you
[24:39] and then you can accept what he's given
[24:41] you but until you do that he can't move
[24:43] on yet he needs you to stand on that how
[24:46] many you know how many examples does
[24:48] each of us have we talked about a living
[24:50] God last night
[24:52] each one of us we could circle from Pew
[24:54] to Pew each one of us has got at least
[24:56] one testimony well God's moved in their
[24:58] life
[24:59] or their close family's life
[25:01] don't let it come commonplace
[25:03] David here David I always referred back
[25:06] to it he said the only the Goliath
[25:07] standing the other line was there and he
[25:09] left I can do this too
[25:11] yeah look back at our lives and think
[25:12] recognize Lord recognize that God you've
[25:15] moved from me before you'll move for me
[25:18] again
[25:19] goes on down and says Shem go he could
[25:21] have said I'm a Seed of Abraham
[25:23] and Shem girl could think of the natural
[25:25] seed but then he goes on down and he
[25:26] says how much more of us being the Royal
[25:29] Seed of Abraham
[25:31] Memorial Seed of Abraham who we are he
[25:34] he never ain't some God never wanted to
[25:36] learn he didn't go to school
[25:39] to learn how to fight
[25:41] he he didn't he didn't put his money
[25:42] into technology he didn't put his he
[25:45] just got down and he began to pray
[25:48] he says God what can I do
[25:50] God what can I do
[25:53] and when God decided to use him he jumps
[25:55] out that window with an ox goat
[25:58] and he says come on Philistines God
[26:00] doesn't showed me right and he wasn't
[26:02] scared a bit he didn't back up he didn't
[26:04] stand in the corner he just come at him
[26:06] and once he'd come at him he slew off
[26:08] 600 of them and I say we need to do the
[26:12] same thing grab that Ox goat step out on
[26:15] faith step out on faith and forget about
[26:17] what your families told you forget about
[26:19] what the world's telling you forget
[26:21] about how bad the economy is forget
[26:23] about how much pressure is on the
[26:24] message Believers forget about all the
[26:26] chaos around it grab your faith stand up
[26:29] and take it right because it's yours God
[26:33] gave it to you and I he gave us
[26:34] happiness he gave us joy he gave us
[26:36] blessings abundantly if we'll stand up
[26:39] and we'll take it
[26:41] he never wanted to learn how to do it he
[26:43] says now wait a minute I'm Gonna Roll
[26:44] your seed I'm a Seed of Abraham I'm
[26:47] circumcised so you know all these
[26:49] Philistines are good Warriors
[26:51] they've been practicing a long time
[26:54] I'll go down to the Seminary and get my
[26:56] PhD or lld I learned how to duel I
[26:58] learned how to how the church rules
[27:02] if he had done that that's all he would
[27:05] have known
[27:06] anything about
[27:08] and I look at the world today and that's
[27:10] what we have we send a we take any of
[27:13] our denominations and they send a person
[27:15] off to school for 10 years
[27:18] to be to be a professor to be a to be a
[27:21] minister and they come back and all they
[27:23] know is what they taught them
[27:25] and they don't know God
[27:27] how much more do we need men that know
[27:29] God maybe they don't talk good brother
[27:32] Branham says how can he use me I can't
[27:34] even talk good I'm from Kentucky
[27:36] Moses said the same thing he said God
[27:38] you can't use me I said he's like I I
[27:40] started
[27:42] well you know what that's good excuse
[27:44] I'll give somebody talk for you
[27:46] God don't want to hear our excuses right
[27:48] God called you now to do something he
[27:51] wants us to do it and you know we can't
[27:52] get out here we talk about all the time
[27:54] we look around and I think here we are
[27:56] we talk about the raptures coming the
[27:57] Rapture is coming I can't wait to go
[27:59] home some of the songs sung this morning
[28:01] I love them we'll see him on that day
[28:03] we'll see him
[28:05] we need to make a move
[28:07] we need to recognize God's waiting on
[28:09] you and I
[28:10] God's waiting on you and I to move to
[28:12] him because he's sitting there with his
[28:14] arms outstretched saying children come
[28:17] come come unto me come unto me I want
[28:20] you to come I've waited all these
[28:23] thousands of years so that my word can
[28:25] be manifested but I need you to
[28:28] recognize who you are I need you to
[28:31] recognize that this word was for you
[28:33] what did Jesus at 12 year old and he
[28:35] stands up there and he says this day
[28:37] this scripture is fulfilled he
[28:39] recognized who he was he recognized that
[28:42] he was that scripture that was for him
[28:45] and that was his day and that's who he
[28:47] was that's what you got to do you've got
[28:50] to come to this Bible and find you in
[28:52] this scripture find you in this word and
[28:55] when you recognize that this is you then
[28:57] walk out on it then you can take that
[29:00] Oxford sham guard shamgar recognize you
[29:02] know what I am this he can't take that
[29:04] for me and that's when he come out
[29:06] amongst them and when he come out
[29:08] amongst them he didn't come out there
[29:09] backwards he'd come out there with
[29:11] everything he had
[29:13] and how much more does we need to do
[29:15] that we need to recognize that we are in
[29:17] this scripture that we're not just an
[29:19] afterthought of God that we're not just
[29:21] something that you know that happened
[29:22] after they closed no the book's still
[29:24] open and the book's laying here opening
[29:27] we're coming to the end of time and here
[29:29] we are
[29:30] we're being will being manifested in
[29:33] these scriptures
[29:34] we need to recognize that we're in them
[29:36] scriptures and the bride's going to
[29:38] recognize she's in there and when she
[29:40] recognizes she knows she's not going to
[29:42] worry about her schooling she's not
[29:44] going to worry about how smart she is
[29:45] she's not going to worry that maybe she
[29:47] don't have every revelation God didn't
[29:49] put a thing in there and said that you
[29:51] had to know every Revelation to get to
[29:53] heaven he said believeth on me and he
[29:56] shall be saved believeth on me and he
[29:58] shall be saved brother Brennan said when
[30:00] we get over there we'll be eternity
[30:02] still learning things right so we're not
[30:04] going to know it all here we're going to
[30:06] know a lot
[30:07] what God shows us
[30:09] right but first you got to realize it's
[30:11] him the giving us knowledge you got to
[30:13] recognize where you are in that
[30:16] he says you can't match the enemy I
[30:18] can't match it but remember I'm living
[30:21] under a promise Hallelujah that's
[30:23] already in his powers and been more than
[30:25] matched and conquered and cast down I'm
[30:28] more than a conqueror right now not
[30:31] myself but I'm in him who conquered him
[30:35] for me
[30:36] he said Frank give it a minute then get
[30:38] your hearts go run the devil out run the
[30:41] devil of dead away
[30:43] don't let the devil of Doubt steal your
[30:46] healing don't let the devil of Doubt
[30:48] steal your pride steal your salvation
[30:50] steal everything that God's gave you
[30:52] just because somebody says oh he don't
[30:55] move that way no more you know the days
[30:57] of Miracles are passed
[30:59] really
[31:00] since when because my God didn't tell me
[31:03] that
[31:03] and I've seen it too much in my life
[31:06] I've seen it too much in my family's
[31:08] life I've seen it too much in my church
[31:10] I've seen it too much in the message
[31:12] around the world don't tell me that the
[31:15] days of Miracles have passed I've done
[31:17] experienced it you can't convince me of
[31:19] that all it is is a thought it's a seed
[31:22] of the devil to try to increase doubt in
[31:23] you it's a seed of the devil to try to
[31:26] convince you that God ain't going to
[31:27] move like that no more
[31:29] but he still moves the same if it's not
[31:32] so then Hebrews is wrong when it says
[31:33] the same yesterday today and forever and
[31:36] if that's wrong then throw the whole
[31:38] book out because it ain't worth nothing
[31:40] but it's right and it's true
[31:43] and it's absolutely the word of God and
[31:46] being the word of God he says I can't do
[31:49] it but he that's in me can
[31:51] David never did walk into one of his
[31:54] armies and says oh David here I'm going
[31:55] to show y'all how it's done
[31:58] sham guard didn't jump out the window
[31:59] said here I am shamgar
[32:02] he says my God
[32:04] is in me and here I come
[32:07] here David said he didn't say whenever
[32:09] whenever he made the comment we'd go
[32:11] back and read the scripture he didn't
[32:12] make the statement I'll deliver Goliath
[32:16] he says my God
[32:18] will deliver him into my hands
[32:21] my God
[32:22] you know what man you can't heal each
[32:24] other
[32:25] we can't save each other
[32:27] can come up here as much as you want and
[32:30] all the ministers could stand in here
[32:31] and anoint you and cover you head to toe
[32:33] and we can't do nothing for you
[32:36] but if you can just believe
[32:38] if you can just believe an ounce of
[32:42] faith
[32:43] you can just believe then he
[32:46] can come down and take it all away from
[32:48] him and there's nothing too great for
[32:50] God I look at the little things I think
[32:52] you know
[32:53] I think this little thing comes to my
[32:55] hand when I was at work it's on a
[32:57] Wednesday night my baby daughter and and
[33:00] the McDonald's got the big heavy metal
[33:02] doors
[33:03] and she went out the door and on the
[33:05] hinge side she laid her fingering on
[33:07] that door closed
[33:09] and my wife said when she got there it
[33:11] was as thin as that piece of paper it
[33:13] was and she was crying she's four years
[33:16] old
[33:17] but all she wanted was whether home
[33:19] would pray yeah
[33:20] brother Homer went over there and prayed
[33:22] and Carol said they kind of forgot about
[33:24] it she quit crying what have you so when
[33:27] they got home said she asked her she
[33:29] said tap the house your finger and
[33:30] tether couldn't even remember which hand
[33:32] it was on
[33:34] I couldn't remember which hand it was on
[33:36] don't tell me the days of Miracles were
[33:38] passed
[33:40] you say oh that's just a little finger
[33:42] we've seen cancer fall off people
[33:45] it's not just stories people it's not
[33:48] just stories Church God's still moving
[33:51] today God's still moving but you know
[33:54] what the people that receives that
[33:55] healing they had to recognize there was
[33:57] a god
[33:58] and once they recognize there was a
[34:00] guard they had to recognize that they
[34:01] needed him
[34:02] and then once they recognized that they
[34:05] had to recognize that he
[34:07] could do it not them right so many times
[34:10] we look at our own lives and we think
[34:11] well I can do this
[34:13] I'm a mechanic by trade I look at a car
[34:16] and I think well I could fix that
[34:18] and then three hours later I'm stomping
[34:20] my head going no I can't fix that
[34:24] because it's just the way it is
[34:27] but so many times you know they used to
[34:29] tell me they just tell me they said well
[34:31] how do you do it and I said well
[34:33] somebody calls me and says they broke
[34:35] down on the interstate I began to pray
[34:38] and I get in the car I'm driving to him
[34:40] and I see God
[34:41] it could be one of a million things
[34:44] God just laid my hand
[34:46] just take take this that you gave me and
[34:50] and help me to try to help this brother
[34:54] and it's never failed
[34:56] that I've always been able to do
[34:58] something to get them down the road
[35:01] and I thank God
[35:03] that may be little
[35:05] but he is so concerned about your little
[35:07] things
[35:08] he's so concerned about the little
[35:10] aspects of your life the ones that you
[35:13] look at and think oh you know he ain't
[35:15] got time for that he's got that and all
[35:17] he cares
[35:19] and if you'll recognize he cares he can
[35:21] move for you
[35:22] he cares for the little hair he cares
[35:25] for the little thing that you may think
[35:26] is nothing
[35:29] and he's just he just wants he just
[35:31] wants you to care enough to ask him
[35:35] and I thought of that you know what he
[35:36] said he says he didn't want to learn how
[35:38] to do it well David didn't want a great
[35:41] weapon
[35:42] because we look at it you know and you
[35:44] you know they look at me in the example
[35:46] I gave of going to work on somebody's
[35:47] car and they say well he's a mechanic
[35:49] that's what no
[35:50] that's not why
[35:53] they're trying to take God out of it
[35:55] and that's what David and Shem go in our
[35:58] examples here that's what they didn't
[35:59] want to happen
[36:00] they didn't want to stand up there with
[36:02] the Learned men in the Warfare and
[36:03] everything else and they didn't want him
[36:05] to say yeah but you know Saul trained
[36:08] him for 10 years
[36:09] you know and he trained him in Every Act
[36:11] of war and he trained him how to fight
[36:12] the Goliath and David just used his
[36:14] training
[36:15] no no they didn't want that they wanted
[36:18] to be obvious there was God on the sand
[36:22] and then you and I in our daily lives we
[36:24] need to give him the praise back for
[36:26] that
[36:27] he says he he Delights himself
[36:30] in our praises and worships to him
[36:32] he does it for us not asking anything
[36:35] back
[36:36] he heals your body
[36:38] he saves your soul he gives you a job he
[36:42] gives you the finances to take care of
[36:44] all your needs he gives you
[36:45] Transportation he gives you a pastor he
[36:48] gives you a church he gives you and he
[36:50] don't ask for nothing back
[36:52] but he Delights himself in your praises
[36:55] and when you praise him that just makes
[36:57] him want to give you more just makes you
[36:59] want to give him more
[37:00] it just makes me want to give you more
[37:02] because you know what how much more you
[37:05] know we talked about the brother brother
[37:06] Dale mentioned yesterday and you know he
[37:09] said he said not my sons no
[37:11] I'm their dad
[37:12] anything I have stairs
[37:15] not only they don't necessarily have to
[37:17] ask for it they just tell me they need
[37:18] it
[37:19] that's how God is
[37:21] everything lays in his hands
[37:23] and all you got to do is ask God you see
[37:26] my need
[37:28] God you see where I'm at this morning
[37:31] God you see that maybe I've stumbled a
[37:34] little girl you see the trial the battle
[37:37] I'm going through God moved from me
[37:40] move from me
[37:42] move from me
[37:44] and I think then I think oh we are we
[37:47] really convinced right
[37:49] that we need him as much as we do
[37:52] or am I really convinced that I need him
[37:55] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[37:57] Saturday Sunday
[37:59] in Romans 12 I believe it is Paul says I
[38:02] beseek you to give your
[38:04] everyday life and one version says
[38:07] you're Every Day Life you'll go to work
[38:10] life
[38:11] are you do you really do you really
[38:13] recognize
[38:14] that you need him all the time
[38:16] that we recognize that you're part of
[38:19] the Bride
[38:21] you're part of that bride that he spoke
[38:22] before the foundation of the world and
[38:24] he says I'll have a bride that stands
[38:27] perfect on this day
[38:29] and cross the mystery of God revealed
[38:31] brother Brown says his body
[38:34] would do the works that he promised like
[38:36] in mark 16.
[38:38] his body was not held in the grave but
[38:40] was recognized in him in the
[38:42] resurrection
[38:43] he said do you get it
[38:45] then the body of his believing children
[38:48] would not be held in the grave when he
[38:50] comes
[38:52] but we'll be recognized with him
[38:54] because he died for that purpose
[38:57] to resurrect his bride the body
[38:59] recognized because it was his holy body
[39:03] because it's his word
[39:06] amen and if you are a spoken word and I
[39:08] believe we're spoken words he spoke us
[39:11] before the foundation of the world then
[39:13] that makes you Unholy spoken word and
[39:16] that Holy spoken word unto him
[39:18] is his very life
[39:20] everything that he was he poured into
[39:22] Christ everything that Christ was he
[39:24] poured into the church and there's the
[39:26] bride standing here today with
[39:27] everything
[39:29] in her power recognized recognize our
[39:32] call in our placement yeah
[39:34] recognize our calling places three kinds
[39:36] of Believers by the way up says Joseph
[39:37] another believer he couldn't help being
[39:41] what he was he was a prophet God made
[39:45] him a prophet he didn't want to be
[39:47] different from his brothers but he was
[39:49] different
[39:50] God made him what he was nobody else
[39:53] could take his place
[39:55] nobody can take your place no matter how
[39:59] little you say he says I'm just a
[40:02] housewife
[40:03] nobody can take your place
[40:06] God in this great economy has set so
[40:08] forth that the body of Christ in order
[40:11] till there's no one
[40:13] that can take your place
[40:15] and I look around and you know I talk to
[40:17] especially talking to the youth and and
[40:19] how the youth thinking on they always
[40:21] think well you know I wish I could be a
[40:23] Eddie biscal
[40:24] I I wish I could be a Donny vegan I wish
[40:27] I could be a you name it
[40:30] God didn't call you to be them
[40:32] God called them to be them
[40:34] right God called you maybe to never
[40:36] speak a word in public
[40:39] God called you to maybe just live that
[40:41] life but nobody can take that
[40:44] brother Brennan said Moses couldn't tuck
[40:46] Jesus's spot the same way Jesus could
[40:48] have took Moses spot as much as Jesus
[40:51] was he couldn't have played Moses he had
[40:53] to find his place and you know I think
[40:55] so many times you know you look at you
[40:57] look at David and the example that he
[40:59] was in every aspect
[41:01] David got out of his call and it fell
[41:03] apart
[41:06] there's so many of us we do the same
[41:08] thing
[41:09] we get out of our call and we mess it up
[41:12] because we don't we we've got to
[41:14] recognize that it's not us doing it
[41:16] but it's him doing it through us and if
[41:19] he's called you to speak to 5 000 he'll
[41:21] make it happen
[41:23] you ain't got to try to make it happen
[41:25] you ain't got to sit down and write
[41:26] invitations to get them to come you
[41:29] ain't got to call them and beg them to
[41:30] come to church
[41:31] they'll be there because God's called
[41:34] you to fulfill that right
[41:36] if God's called you to sit on a few and
[41:39] pray for somebody you
[41:41] once you recognize you're calling your
[41:43] placement and I think of that I think oh
[41:46] God help us help us realize who we are
[41:48] help us realize what we're here for and
[41:52] what he wants us to do
[41:54] how many times has it been each one of
[41:56] us can tell testimonies God wake you up
[41:58] in the night to pray for someone
[42:01] they needed it
[42:03] they needed it and I think you know as
[42:06] uncomfortable as it may be sometimes for
[42:08] God to wake me up at 2 30 in the morning
[42:11] but I think you know what
[42:13] if I need prayer I'd like to know
[42:16] somebody will wake up and pray for me
[42:19] I pray for them
[42:21] and I thought of that and when was in
[42:23] Jamaica we hadn't I had an experience
[42:25] down there and I was two three four
[42:27] o'clock in the morning and when I get
[42:28] home my grandma told me I stayed up all
[42:30] night praying for you
[42:32] I thought that's how we make it through
[42:35] recognize God needs you
[42:38] God needs you right
[42:40] it says we can not believe we do not
[42:44] believe that we have the power Lord we
[42:45] just claim
[42:47] we claim to have authority he has all
[42:50] the power and once we recognize that
[42:53] but we recognize we have the authority
[42:55] to it we don't we don't do it we don't
[42:58] step out and do it ourselves
[43:00] we don't step out and say well I'll heal
[43:02] you and I'll do no we'll let him do it
[43:05] but the authority lies within us the
[43:08] bride of Christ not not the ministry not
[43:10] not the the bride of Christ has that
[43:12] Authority the same holy ghost that was
[43:15] in brother Brennan was in you
[43:17] Glory the same holy ghost that Jesus
[43:18] said he'll sin back is in you and I the
[43:21] same power and anointing is in you and I
[43:23] if we can just believe
[43:26] if we can just believe
[43:29] I said oh some way if I can get that
[43:32] message to him brother Brown
[43:33] and he says if you could only see Lord
[43:35] just realize wake them up Lord
[43:38] one more time tonight
[43:39] let them see you're the same God you're
[43:42] confirming your word
[43:44] you keep it just as you promised in the
[43:47] last days you said these things was
[43:48] happened and I thought I said you know
[43:51] he saw things he probably never saw or
[43:53] never said
[43:55] but look around us
[43:57] it doesn't take a genius to realize
[44:00] we're way up into revelation
[44:03] we'll come into a closing of time
[44:05] it's time a bride starts putting herself
[44:08] together
[44:09] and if you read Revelations 19 7 it says
[44:11] she
[44:12] puts herself together it says the script
[44:16] said let us be glad and rejoice and give
[44:17] honor to him for the marriage of the
[44:19] Lamb is coming his wife has made her
[44:23] self ready God didn't come down and bull
[44:27] whip you into the corner and make you
[44:29] get dressed God didn't come down and say
[44:31] no I'm going to make you line up now God
[44:34] said here's my word
[44:36] you recognize who you are and you line
[44:38] up with it
[44:39] and he can't move until you recognize
[44:41] that you're that bride and you recognize
[44:43] who you are and I thought of that and I
[44:45] thought you know that she's like a
[44:46] marriage today if we want to have a
[44:48] marriage Saturday
[44:49] nobody has to warp that bride in the
[44:51] place to get her dress on
[44:55] because if she's obeyed God and she's
[44:57] kept herself clean and he's kept herself
[44:59] clean and they and they've lined
[45:01] theirselves up that they're going to a
[45:02] perfect marriage to a perfect ceremony
[45:04] to live eternity together and they're so
[45:06] in in love with each other that they
[45:09] just can't wait to spend eternity with
[45:12] each other
[45:13] nobody got to stand back then and make
[45:15] her get ready
[45:17] and she's probably pushing people out of
[45:19] the way yeah
[45:20] yeah right you're like look at my time
[45:22] y'all y'all had y'all's time it's my
[45:24] time to get up out of that altar
[45:26] and that man you know they may be a
[45:28] little nervous about him he's nerves
[45:30] anytime you get in front of people
[45:32] but you know what he ain't gonna stay in
[45:34] the back room or the front room in this
[45:36] case he he ain't gonna stay back there
[45:38] and say well Pastor I don't know if I'm
[45:39] ready to go or not
[45:41] you know I just
[45:43] he can't wait to get out there
[45:45] and most of them if it's anything like
[45:47] me and my wife we're looking at brother
[45:48] Carol we're like you heard this thing up
[45:51] you know we don't want to sit up here
[45:52] and talk all day
[45:54] you know we want to get married right
[45:56] right we want to start our life together
[45:58] we want to be with each other
[46:02] and I thought of the bride of Christ
[46:05] in that way we should be
[46:08] right if we recognize we're his bride
[46:10] we shouldn't we we don't want to wait
[46:13] any longer
[46:15] we don't want to struggle in this fight
[46:17] anymore
[46:18] we want to fight this world and all of
[46:21] its Temptations anymore
[46:23] well it'll be run into that altar
[46:25] we'll be running to that altar saying
[46:27] God take me
[46:28] God Take Me As I Am forgive me Lord
[46:31] Jesus take everything from me because I
[46:33] want to spend the rest of my life with
[46:35] you I want to spend the rest of my life
[46:37] with your Holy Spirit and my soul I want
[46:39] to spend everything every aspect of my
[46:41] life I want you to come into me
[46:44] and I want you to confirm this marriage
[46:47] and then I want you as we said yesterday
[46:50] be that Living God in Me
[46:53] I want you to live through me I don't
[46:56] want people to say where there's that
[46:57] there's that Jonathan Jones when you
[46:59] yeah we knew him
[47:01] no I wanted to look at and say man
[47:03] something happened that boy
[47:06] amen you know we had a we had at the
[47:09] church here a couple weeks ago with but
[47:11] Kyle was witnessing to a little uh
[47:14] fellow that was at the McDonald's we was
[47:16] eating
[47:17] and I asked him to come to church he
[47:19] come to church but Kyle okay I'll stop
[47:21] by and pick him up and I believe he's
[47:22] homeless
[47:23] and so he come to church and he come to
[47:25] church he seen one of the other brothers
[47:26] in church he goes oh God I know him
[47:29] I don't know and then after church he
[47:32] said something to him he says man I know
[47:34] where that guy come from he said that's
[47:35] something real here
[47:38] and I thought yeah that's that's what I
[47:40] want
[47:41] and God wants that too
[47:44] God wants us to recognize that we can't
[47:46] do it without him
[47:49] we can't do it without him
[47:51] it don't matter how long we've been in
[47:53] this thing
[47:54] if you've been in this thing 30 40 50
[47:56] years if you leave God out of it you'll
[47:58] fail
[48:00] if you take God out of your life you'll
[48:03] be right back out there with them
[48:04] because this fleshly body is going to
[48:06] desire the things of the world
[48:08] and if there ain't a holy ghost here to
[48:10] keep it under subjection it's going to
[48:11] fail
[48:12] and if you don't keep him every day of
[48:14] your life
[48:16] you want to fail
[48:18] why do you think we see it in the
[48:19] message we think we grow up in the
[48:21] message and we think you know we hear
[48:23] the prophet talk about whether the
[48:24] Baptist whether the Pentecost whether
[48:26] method is and that's why we quote it
[48:28] because we quote the prophet but what
[48:30] about the message
[48:31] the message has got as many problems as
[48:33] the Baptist has got
[48:35] it right we the claim we follow this
[48:36] blessage has got as much issues as the
[48:39] Baptist has got
[48:41] we got as much marriage problems as the
[48:43] Baptist has got we got as much sin
[48:45] problem as the Baptist has got we got as
[48:47] much idolism as the Baptist he's got
[48:52] it we need God
[48:54] and we need God first in our lives
[48:57] we need God first in our hearts we need
[48:59] God first in our churches we need God
[49:01] first in our families
[49:03] and we need to look to him for
[49:04] everything that we ask and do
[49:06] because if not we become
[49:10] just another another ideal right another
[49:13] theology
[49:14] another great another great man that you
[49:16] know you know like that portray him you
[49:18] can go back and pick up old books and
[49:20] they're portrayed brother Branham as a
[49:22] as a general of faith and and and a
[49:25] great man of God and and a forerunner
[49:27] the faith healing and
[49:29] well that's all we become
[49:33] yeah but we're much more than that
[49:35] we're a chosen bride out of this chosen
[49:39] generation that's going to take that
[49:41] message and she's going to live it
[49:43] but first we got to recognize that's who
[49:45] we are
[49:46] right and I think of I think I think of
[49:48] one of the favorite one of my favorite
[49:49] quotes and he's in the church age book
[49:51] and he says and the and the reading says
[49:56] he knows talking about the devil he
[49:58] knows if the people get the true
[49:59] revelation
[50:01] of the true church
[50:04] and what she is
[50:06] she's done what she stands for then she
[50:08] can do Greater Works then she becomes an
[50:11] invincible Army
[50:13] I'm longing for that
[50:15] I'm longing for that I'm longing for the
[50:17] time that we can stand as a United bride
[50:20] and say there's my savior in the sky and
[50:23] he's coming to get me because you know I
[50:25] see in Revelations as as time closes out
[50:28] and we're closing out the book I see in
[50:30] Revelations where it says the bride says
[50:33] them that believe says even so come
[50:37] quickly that's when she's recognized who
[50:40] she is and she's had enough of living in
[50:42] this past house she's had enough of
[50:44] living in this world and she said Okay
[50:46] God we see we're her we're ready come
[50:49] now come now come now take us and I
[50:53] thank God
[50:54] help us to recognize that
[50:56] help us to recognize that right and I
[50:59] thought of that and is it there's a
[51:01] thought just kind of played in my mind
[51:03] last night I thought God
[51:07] what's it going to take
[51:09] for us to really recognize
[51:12] because I look around and I look all
[51:13] around us and I thank God
[51:16] I had a brother asked me one time
[51:18] because I I I read that quote
[51:20] which says she'll become the when she
[51:22] realizes who she is and he and his is an
[51:25] elderly and I'm not talking bad about
[51:27] the brother at all love him to death but
[51:29] he said well after this many years you
[51:31] don't think we realize we're the bride
[51:33] and I said no I don't
[51:36] know I said no I don't I said I think we
[51:39] have an intellectual conception
[51:41] that we're the bride but it ain't
[51:42] dropped here yet
[51:43] it ain't dropped here yet like brother
[51:46] Brenham said about that scripture on
[51:47] greater is he that's in me he said if we
[51:49] could get that Revelation nothing could
[51:52] stand before us if we could get
[51:55] that Revelation nothing could stand in
[51:57] our way we could walk out like Shem go
[52:00] and take all of the doubt down we could
[52:01] take all the sickness down he says in
[52:05] one place he says he said where Jesus
[52:07] was doubt had to flee
[52:10] where the bride is doubt has to flee
[52:13] he said when Jesus walked into the town
[52:15] people laying on the side fell in his
[52:17] shadows and raised up the bride should
[52:19] manifest the same thing because it's the
[52:21] same word of God in Jesus that's in the
[52:23] bride of Christ and if we can recognize
[52:25] who we are and we can recognize that
[52:27] them things that start happening
[52:29] we'll start coming around and we'll
[52:31] change atmospheres at work we'll change
[52:33] atmospheres and family get-togethers
[52:35] we'll change atmospheres because of who
[52:38] we are and because of what we are and
[52:40] who we stand for not not because of what
[52:42] this flesh is right
[52:44] because of the god that lives in us and
[52:47] when that God walks on the scene Devils
[52:48] have to flee demons have to flee
[52:51] sickness has to flee
[52:54] first
[52:55] we got to recognize we need him
[52:59] and you say well here I am I've been
[53:01] coming to this church for 20 years
[53:05] I've been coming here all my life
[53:10] but when's the last time you really got
[53:11] away with God
[53:14] what'd they say you know uh you know
[53:17] different ones they they go through
[53:19] there and they talked about uh back when
[53:21] I was a kid growing up they talked about
[53:23] John Elway quarterback of the Denver
[53:25] Broncos and all the great things he did
[53:28] Joe Montana and they said well now
[53:30] they're just living on their past
[53:32] I think as Christians we do the same
[53:34] thing
[53:35] we move for God so much
[53:38] and then we get happy
[53:40] and then we sit down and we say yep yep
[53:42] God's did this gods did this through me
[53:44] God's did this but what's he doing today
[53:46] what's he doing today because my kids
[53:49] they're never really fully grasped
[53:53] what the prophet did in the 60s
[53:55] because that's a century before them
[53:57] right
[53:59] right they're never fully grasped what
[54:01] my grandparents saw right
[54:03] they'll never fully grasp what my
[54:05] parents saw
[54:06] they need to see in me a living God they
[54:10] need to recognize that they have to have
[54:12] that same God I told my oldest daughter
[54:14] here and not not to talk not to put on
[54:16] the spot embarrass her nobody looked at
[54:18] her but
[54:19] I told her the other day I says
[54:21] you're 13.
[54:24] us as most people in the message anyway
[54:27] getting married 18 19 year old yeah
[54:30] I said that gives you five six more
[54:31] years
[54:32] under my roof
[54:34] and I says as long as you're here I'll
[54:36] I'll ensure that you're at church that
[54:39] you love God that you pray that you see
[54:42] us reading the Bible that you I said but
[54:44] Elizabeth what are you going to do when
[54:45] you leave here
[54:47] I can't make you live this life
[54:51] and we need to recognize we can't make
[54:53] our kids live the same life we do
[54:56] I look in the message and I look around
[54:58] our ranks and I think what have we done
[55:00] it's like we just expect them
[55:03] to grow up and believe this message and
[55:06] go on
[55:07] and I look around and I see a youth
[55:09] generation leaving
[55:12] I see them leaving
[55:14] we went to LA camp this year and had one
[55:16] of the best camps they said they've had
[55:18] in L.A their brother Tim told me all
[55:21] right
[55:23] but all of my group said that's the
[55:26] least we've seen there in years
[55:28] and I think what's happening
[55:31] we're not taking them back to the word
[55:34] and making them realize they need the
[55:37] same God I got
[55:39] I can't live for them I can't live for
[55:42] your kids you can't live for your kids
[55:43] they need God
[55:45] and they need a real God they don't need
[55:48] something they can say well you know you
[55:50] know I could sit here and say well I
[55:52] seen God do this in my papa and I seen
[55:54] God do this and no they don't do good
[55:56] enough
[55:57] we need recognize
[56:00] that our children
[56:01] needs to see a living God in their life
[56:06] what it what else can convince them if
[56:09] you want to stand
[56:10] musicians want to come
[56:12] what else can convince them
[56:16] that they need to serve this same God
[56:18] Amen than a life lived before
[56:22] but I had some wonderful parents my
[56:24] parents was wonderful raise me in this
[56:26] message taught me many things that I
[56:28] needed to know in life
[56:31] but how much more
[56:33] do I need to pray in front of my kids
[56:35] yeah
[56:36] how much more do I need to read the
[56:37] Bible in front of my kids how much more
[56:40] do I need to talk about God in front of
[56:42] my kids
[56:44] each and every one of us
[56:46] there's so much more we can do for our
[56:48] children
[56:50] instead of just hey we'll take him to
[56:51] church and we'll just we'll just put
[56:53] them into God now God put them into your
[56:55] hands as parents
[56:57] and he says God he said he said children
[56:59] here's you some children raise them
[57:02] under my likeness not under your
[57:04] likeness but raise them under my
[57:05] lightness
[57:06] and I think we fail that as parents
[57:09] right here pointing at myself we feel
[57:11] that amen
[57:12] we don't give
[57:14] our children enough God
[57:18] we can tell him that brother Branham
[57:19] said this and brother Brenham said that
[57:22] but what did you say
[57:24] because I can come to church and I can
[57:26] come up here and preach and I can look
[57:27] good
[57:28] well I don't know if that's possible but
[57:30] I can try to look good
[57:33] and then I can go home and the first
[57:36] time she does something wrong I can get
[57:38] angry yeah
[57:39] and she thinks hmm
[57:42] is that really him yeah
[57:45] or I can sit down with her and talk with
[57:47] her
[57:48] let's pray about this
[57:51] and I may still have to punish her I'm
[57:52] not saying no Punisher
[57:55] but we can pray about it together
[57:57] and then we can say you know what what
[57:59] you did was wrong
[58:01] that's punishment that comes with that
[58:04] but I still love you right
[58:06] right and God still loves you children
[58:08] no matter what you've did no matter what
[58:10] you stumbled on God still loves you
[58:13] and he may whoop you
[58:15] and he may punish him he's done me
[58:17] several times
[58:19] but at the end he's got his hand
[58:20] outstretched he said stand back up I'll
[58:24] put you back in the line of duty and I
[58:26] put you back to work something on your
[58:28] heart brother 683.
[58:31] that's 683 inspirable
[58:35] without him
[58:37] here
[58:38] I could do nothing foreign
[59:23] afternoon
[59:24] please please
[59:51] I would be nice
[59:56] with us
[1:00:16] thank God
[1:00:20] all God wants is us to get out of the
[1:00:24] ways Let Him Live
[1:00:28] let him live in our hearts in our lives
[1:00:38] away how about
[1:00:41] it
[1:00:47] Jesus
[1:00:53] I would be
[1:00:57] nice
[1:01:08] said all God wanted was one person in
[1:01:11] his hands
[1:01:13] one person he said
[1:01:15] that when the Bible
[1:01:22] do you want a Revival then let's start
[1:01:25] in you
[1:01:29] but our problem is we want to Revival in
[1:01:31] somebody else
[1:01:36] we want somebody else to do something
[1:01:40] instead of letting it start in me
[1:01:44] he needs the sound guard
[1:01:47] he needs a David in the last days well
[1:01:51] there's a lot of giants around
[1:01:55] children he needs you to
[1:01:59] I will Adventure
[1:02:14] anybody else want to come
[1:02:26] foreign
[1:03:03] time
[1:03:05] now
[1:03:11] see all God needs is somebody in his
[1:03:13] hands
[1:03:15] he just needs somebody to yield herself
[1:03:17] to to him
[1:03:20] the rest in him and he can take care of
[1:03:23] everything else
[1:03:26] don't win
[1:03:27] we try to fight our own struggles and
[1:03:30] battles instead of I'm just leaving it
[1:03:33] up to the Lord
[1:03:34] the Lord whatever
[1:03:37] like a share
[1:03:39] whatever it takes you come on the scene
[1:03:41] do it
[1:03:43] take away
[1:03:45] well you know I've never seen him fight
[1:03:46] all of you
[1:03:49] never seen him fail when I do it that
[1:03:52] way now if I try to fight my own battles
[1:03:54] and try to do her
[1:03:56] I mess up
[1:04:00] just wait on him and when he tells you
[1:04:03] to move you move
[1:04:06] because you know God a lot of times like
[1:04:08] the brother was quoting
[1:04:11] it was last night
[1:04:14] the prophet said he has to push me to
[1:04:18] get me to do
[1:04:21] see sometimes he wants you to just step
[1:04:23] out
[1:04:25] you step out on it
[1:04:29] what's the problem why can't we
[1:04:32] well I'm afraid of myself but don't
[1:04:35] worry about it you're already a failure
[1:04:38] born one
[1:04:42] but God takes failures and makes Heroes
[1:04:44] out of them
[1:04:47] all he needs is just us to believe
[1:04:51] without you
[1:04:54] my baby
[1:05:07] Jesus
[1:05:42] us
[1:05:48] but we can't make it without his
