of my heart open the eyes of my heart I want to see a man I want to see open the eyes of my heart I want to see I want to see to see shining in the light of your glory for out your pilot [Music] shining in the pour out your power in love as we train [Music] I want to see [Music] and if you want to see you got a look into the word let's turn over an exodus chapter to Monica and Zoe our home because it was that we was saved and I said y'all just I'll speak tonight on a little topic of overcoming power let's read Exodus to verse 11 to 14 let's just go to the Lord in prayer well God we're so grateful to you tonight to be able to come together around your word and look into your word the mirror of your word Lord you just to see how we compare and stack up and I pray God I know that you'll just be with us tonight or to open up your word to us to receive a blessing and we've come expecting Lord Jesus I believe we're all expecting a change to your changes Lord Jesus from the creatures that we that we are now even to do more and more like you I pray God that you'll just grant it Lord that you'll open up your word to us and we invite you into our hearts and into this place now we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Exodus chapter 2 verse 11 to 14 and it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown then he would out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting and Hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand and when he went out the second day behold two men are they Hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore samadhis now my fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intend us now to kill me as thou kill us the Egyptian and Moses feared and said surely this thing is known may be seated the Lord's blessing to the reading hour so I want to speak on overcoming power and talk about what it takes to get it and the recipe for how to get it and in this in this little story this is maybe a hard Scripture be talking about overcoming power but in this little story we were reminded of this you know we know about how Moses was his mama taught him all you know growing up that he was going to be the deliverer that he was gonna taught him about the word and showed him the things that were that were spoken of him and kind of placed him and identified him about who he was going to be so he began to look into think about those things and as he got older maybe he was thinking well you know I'm supposed to deliver these people so now is the time and so you know he what he did was he he he he he thought I'm gonna I'm gonna help Israel I'm gonna help deliver Israel I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna help woman and and I'm gonna solve their problems in this way but the problem was that he wasn't equipped to do it and so so we know that he was predestinated to destroy the enemy he was born to destroy the enemy to destroy all those things he was predestinated for that cause but yet he started off on the wrong foot he started off on the wrong the right footing with the wrong foundation is that he he went into it with the right motive and the right objective but yet he was not equipped for that task and we know that God equips a man when he calls him me he puts puts in him something to do the work to to fight the battle and so so Moses you imagine somebody on a battlefield and they and they look down at their hands and they find out that they don't have a sword in their hand and they look down at their their feet and their feet are not shod with the the preparation of the gospel of peace and they look like their head and it's not the helmet of salvation is not up there and they look at their chest and the Blessed plate parade of righteousness is not on their chest and and it looks like you know why would they even go into battle that way to begin with to try to overcome the enemy but in this case you know it seems like so many today do so many kind of you you know go into battle without the right kind of preparation without the right kind of equipment without the right kind of and you know what it turns out to be is it's like these two these two men looking at Moses how he had failed he had turned into a murderer because he went about it the wrong way he went about it the wrong way and it turned in it turned him into a murderer where he was a pro because he approached it the wrong way and you look at you look at so many other people in the Bible they like Paul he started off without the right equipment he started off with the right with the right motive and the right objectives like Gamaliel had taught him he had said under his feet and he knew all the letters and everything but yet something was something was wrong because he went out killing people he was a murderer there he stood holding the coat of stephen there he stood watching these Christians be killed for their faith and and and it turned out to just be absolutely the wrong path because he started off not equipped the right way you know there's so many other people in the Bible that they're written of that that they started off down the wrong path and they ended up being killers because they attack the wrong thing they attack the Word of God they attacked the thing that would be really trying to help them the most you look at Paul and David turned out to be a killer and then here this Moses a killer and he destroyed the Egyptian and it turned out to be a great disappointment as all these people stood there looking at him at a horrible disappointment of failure I thought you were supposed to be the deliverer I spot you I thought you were supposed to be helping me and it turned out to just be you know they they looked on him and and what what did Moses do he tried to cover it under the sand because it said in verse 12 and he looked this way and that way and he when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand and you wonder if those sands began to sift back or we don't know how those two men began to they uncovered the thing that Moses had done but one way or the other it was uncovered so that's the that's the thing we you know we want our problems to be uncovered so that they can be dealt with so that they can be brought into life because because when the problem was uncovered then Moses realized that he was not equipped that he did not have that overcoming power that he needed to deliver the children of Israel and so then he could do something about it of course what he did was he he ran off into the wilderness he ran off into the desert because he was afraid he was scared and so he ran away he began to run away from Pharaoh and you see that's one of the identifying characteristics of a man that does not have overcoming power is that there's something in then that shakes that trembles that at the prospect of being being something being brought in the light of something being shared publicly of something being identified and so we ran off into the desert running coward and you know how brother Brown talked about how that God can't use a coward he can only use somebody that well you can only use somebody that's equipped to fight the battle and the only way that you can be equipped to fight the battle is by the Word of God there's no other way and so so you you see I'm gonna get into some quotes here I got a lot of quote reading but the the problem with people that are not equipped in this day is that you might be it might look on the outside like you're equipped to fight the battle but down on the inside there's something that's lacking something that's not right and it will war against the truth it will fight out and lash out and something won't be right down on the end something will be messed up and we call that anointed ones and so what anointed ones will do is you know back in the Garden of Eden the the very first preacher really was was a was Satan and he came down and he began to preach his ideas and the way he preached here was he just took what God said and just added a little bit or took a little bit away from it and so you see the great danger of of preaching the gospel is if you don't preach it absolutely right down the line you can either give a life or you can take it away you can either give a life or you can become a murderer you can become a killer if you don't preach it absolutely exactly right down the line so Moses he went running into the desert and he went he went to get equipped I wonder if he went running around in the desert he's thinking about how am I supposed to get equipped and you know a lot of times that's how people and go they go to church and they and and they and they sit there for years and there they begin to wonder well how am i how do I get equipped and they and they study the message and they study the quotes and still everything doesn't come together and you need to be equipped and so the RIT the way to get equipped here's a little secret the seed has to come through the body and so you got to get in touch with somebody that has it that problem is that we try to figure it out on our own and we go off on our own and we and we say well it looks like it's this so I think you know I think it'll probably work like that and that that will just mess everything up that is that is I know worst problem to go off and try to figure it out for yourself instead of getting in touch with somebody that knows how everything works because the that's God's plan is that the word has to come through the body it goes from one to the other and one picks up the word and quickens experience to them they get the revelation and then they know what it says so that they can share it with you and if you don't get in touch with one of the body members then you're you're really out of look like the Ethiopian eunuch that said how am I supposed to know this is so - unless some money will help me how am I supposed to understand unless somebody will help me and so if you don't get in touch with somebody in the body if you don't go to them to ask for questions and and and find out for yourself and the danger here is that you're looking outside they'll be an anointing it on the outside and look right and correct but down on the inside something is warring with the truth something will kill and destroy and murder the truth because this something there's something out of joint something's not right the truth is what will set you free the truth is what will will give you overcoming power and liberty and release you from the bonds of sin and death and sickness and horror and all those things let's read quote number 1 you must be born again brother Branham said and I think these are all things that we we've read before but you realize how almost you know we think we think about how the in in the Garden of Eden how one word off was thou shalt not surely die just one word off but that's not the only place where the devil can sow something extra y'all just leave that up there but I'm gonna talk for a second you know you know you think about Moses coming on the scene and not being equipped that's where that's where the devil wants to get involved is when a minister is not equipped our son of God is not equipped he wants to get in there and get involved so that he can add something or subtract from it add a little extra requirement or little extra requirement and then nobody gets to be born again because you've got to have the right revelation you got to have the right words sewn to be born again if you don't have the right words sewn and the understanding correctly presented then then the devil won't leave the unclean spirit won't leave the life can't come into your heart everything just gets all messed up you must be born again brother Bram said you believe every word just the way it's wrote here we don't need and the Bible said it's of no private interpretation do you know what that means private interpretation private interpretation means you go off by yourself and huddle up and try to figure it out and then you say well this has got to be what it means and then you messed everything up you become a failure you become a disappointment you've become a murderer you become everything wrong everything is just messed up because you haven't gone into it with approaching it in the right way because it is of no private interpretation God interpreted it and this is the way it is don't the Bible say in 2nd Peter there the Bible is of no private interpretation certainly no private it's wrote just the way it means it right like that just leave it just the way its wrote here it'll bring the same results so that when the Bible says faith comes by hearing the word that's what it means it means if the word is presented to you and you receive it into the womb of your heart and you just say I believe it then that's all that's required that's the only requirement as you believe it and you confess it and confess it means you just say ah that's it that's it and that's all you've got to do but our problem is we go off with our little private interpretations and we'll say well it means this and that stops the whole plan of God how can you be born again if you've gone off with your own private interpretation you've got to receive it from the body you've got to you got to hear it from somebody and that's our problem we get questions and stuff and we're like well what does this mean and we won't go to somebody that knows the answer to find out what it means we try to figure it out for ourselves maybe I appreciate myself now false teachers will bring false births true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word Christ do you understand why that is because a false teacher a false Anointed One someone with just an anointing on their life but not a bored birth not the birth of the word in their soul will not know how to present it and so it will always come out wrong when they speak it it'll be something wrong in there because the Devils involved and he's the one adding or subtracting from it he's the one saying well now instead of just believing the word now you got to go do some novenas or push a quarter with your nose or do so you got to go talk to the priest and ask forgiveness and stuff like that all those all those things that we should have gotten away from when we came out of Catholicism but denominationalism and all those things all that stuff should have died do you know that's what a death is a death is not just solving and crying and stuff but a death is when you that old idea that you had you laid it down and you say well I don't believe that no more and a lot of time there's a lot of struggling and striving and everything when you you like if you like maybe Moses wandering around the wilderness school what does this mean what do I have to do now and then you get in touch with somebody in this case listen Moses was a prophet so he got it straight from God he downloaded directly from the source but you and I are not prophets we got to get it from another member of the body because the seed comes through the body false teachers will bring the false births true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word Christ false prophets will bring false birth the birth of churches the birth of Crees the birth of denominations and here you are Pentecostal brother false sensations and tell a man he's got the Holy Ghost he speaks with tongue listen see that's another thing that a false teacher will bring they'll put it instead of putting it on a revelation of the word instead of putting it on the evidence of the scripture they'll put it on some kind of sensation or some emotion I felt something I something like that listen when when the angel came to Mary and she said be it unto me according to thy word there was no evidence that anything had taken place oh she did what she looked at the angel that said be it unto me according that word she just confessed it and then then she went over to Elizabeth and the word began to come forth from her and she began to prophesy and speak of what was growing in her womb and even though I hadn't been born here even though I hadn't come forth it had been conceived something was moving in there and so when the Word of God is planted in your heart and something begins to move something begins to grow you might not have any kind of sensation any kind of emotion at all but something has taken place and a false teacher won't be able to identify that to you because they'll always put the evidence on an emotion or some kind of sensation something other than the word but the word is the evidence the revelation of the word and your life where your life has been changed you can see it and you got the works and the evidence is you can bring the word by word true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word Christ false prophets will bring false the birch of churches the birth already that he said I've seen devil's speak with tongues pencils a leg down and riding unknown tongues that don't mean a thing see it's got to be a life by their fruit you shall know them brother Branham do you believe in speaking in tongues yes sir you believe in shouting yes sir to be a Christian I believe that I believe God's Word but if the life isn't there to back it up and we believe in shouting but we believe in speaking in tongues and we believe in all of those things but you know a lot of times emotion and sensations is where the devil will get in the devil will get in and speak through somebody and make it look like they got discernment or something he'll get in there and speak something to shout it out or whatever and make it look like something's going on when really there ain't nothing going on he said get out there a stuffed shirt glory to God hallelujah and then tell me that's Christ Christ was humble meek and gentle go into a town and my you Jeff to just be be just brushed off the shoulders you know and everything has to be just right not a wrinkle in your suit and you have to have the very best or you won't even come at all and on and on listen the devil the devil has been after the seat of God trying to destroy it since the very beginning us this great warfare where the power the overcoming power of God in the bride is at war with the devil and the way that God does war with the devil is through the unadulterated seed word nothing added nothing subtracted it's absolutely the word and the way the devil does war with God as he tries to add something to it or take something from it they try and then cuz that stops everything if you've got something to add it or something subtracted you cannot have faith because that will not produce faith it will not produce anything it will just stop everything let's go quote number B Christ is revealed in his own word today so confused about the evidence of the holy ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed that's where them the tape on false anointed ones are anointed ones they can be anointed with the spirit speaking tongues dance shout preach the gospel and still a devil it's the inside her and then he says now remember jesus said all the father's given to me will come no man can come except my father draws him first you think about that that that it could be a deacon it could be a minister it could be anybody in the laity that thinks that they're born again because they prayed long enough to get a sensation or something but they didn't go to where the word was they didn't go to the source to understand to get a revelation to clear away all the doubts to clear away all the confusion to talk to somebody and say well this means this and this means that and so they didn't do that and so then it's then it gets all messed up let's look at number c1 this he said now she one word not a whole Decalogue just one word she questioned God because it was presented to her in that light that that word was questionable God's Word cannot be questioned he meant just what he said but she questioned it because it was predicted her to her oh well God surely didn't mean that now see see how simple this is you and I can look at the word and think as we're reading something well God surely didn't mean that and you'll think that because of something somebody else said some you'll passed a minister that already told you something or somebody that you saw on Facebook or something that was planning in your mind and that's got to die that's what the death is that that thing that was planted as to die so that life can spring forth Oh God surely didn't mean that but he did mean that God means every word he says and it doesn't need any private interpretation it's just the way he said it well say how you know about the Bible I believe that my God has guided this Bible he watches over his word he knows that atheists and infidels would arise in the last days so he's watched over it this is exactly the way God minute it's the way it's to us now now we must believe it one word off of it and we lose our fellowship go off into death eternal separation from God just as Adam and Eve did we must believe God's truth because one word added or subtracted will mess everything up your name goes off the list because you've added something and adding is as simple as saying instead of just believing well now you got to do this instead of just believing God's Word and confessing then you got to do something extra there's no other extras listen we there's a lot of things that go around the new birth there's a lot of things that like we go to church you got you got to go to church right you get you need to go to church there's things that you have to do you there's a whole economy of things that have to happen but the basis of your revelation the basis of the requirement of the overcoming power is that you have heard the word and you've received it through the right channel through the right interpretation presented to you by somebody that knows what they're talking about and then you receive it and it becomes a revelation to you because it's quicken where the RAM said it will say how you know about the Bible I believe that my God has guided this Bible he watches over his word he knows that atheist and infidels would arise in the last days so he's watched over it this is exactly the way God minutes away it's to us now now we must believe it did already there I show dear come on ba you with the program all right and we lose our fellowship go off into death eternal separation from God just as Adam and Eve did we must believe God's truth let's look at number D how I got to mix the letters and numbers cuz I I put I got carried away when I was robbed my name Satan and Eden when he first come to these attack to attack a person knowing the children of God was fortified with this word Satan attacked the word see that's what Satan's tactic is to strike out at the word at the source of the thing and see that's where Moses messed up and Paul messed up Paul not have being equipped to do it right lashed out at the thing that would help him the most not having the right understand and lashed out at it and struck at it because he wasn't equipped right but when you get the equipment then you know what's right and everything lines up so you never attack the being he attacked the word first look at that sneaker lizard what he does a day that's funny that's like you know how Jesus called here that old Fox look at that sneaker lizard what he does today the first thing he can't lay it on say well that's not a good person that's a good person see but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get them to deny that word that's just the only only thing he wants to do get you to deny that word now I'm not trying to scare anybody but it's easy to deny the word if you don't have the right interpretation of it because you can look at the word and say I believe that I believe it but like my through 28:19 I believe that at Matthew 20 19 is the scripture we always go to refer to such things as this you look at that and say I believe that but you don't have the right understanding to it for it and to get the right understanding you got to go to somebody that does so they can tell you to look there's not jesus is not three person preet three different people hey God is not three different people he's he's one God with with different attributes and then somebody can explain that to you and you and the light bulb goes oh oh and what that does is when somebody explains it as that kills that old idea it's David it's dead and bird in the ground and it won't be like that Egyptian that Moses tried to cover up where the the sand maybe drifted away and somebody comes by says it's not dead or there it is or whatever it'll be it'll be really dead but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get them to deny that word that's just the only thing he wants to do get you to deny that word so Satan tried to attack the word in the Garden of Eden so he had to have something now that he could use to the human being would look better than that word see he had to have something that would look better to the human being than word and do you know what he used reasoning just what we'd say common sense and common sense looks like you're reading the word are you reading the message and brother branham says something a little bit confusing or strange like for example the one example I like to give us is where brother Branham was telling the story of Haman and the old testament of how he naman how he had to go dip into the river Jordan seven times how he had to go dip and brother Brown back in 1951 said he didn't have to dip he just had to believe and then later on in another message he said he had to dip wherever he was gonna keep that leprosy well that can be a little bit confusing you know you know what it is is you all you have to do is believe but some people are a little bit stubborn and they're believing so that need a little jump-start or like you your car when your battery dies you need somebody to go but off and so name and need a little jump starter and so he had to go dip seven times some people have to have to do some people have to come up to the altar some people have to shout a little bit it's not that you have to do those things but if God requires it of you you must be willing to do it that's the thing that you must be willing to do it if it's required of you but the thing is the basis of it all is faith in the word faith in the word we're Maya let's go to II Hebrews chapter seven and you people with these sawblade tempers that's always spouting off of the mouth of somebody can't put up and things like that say I'm going I'm switching back over to the murderer Moses the murderer of Paul the murderer David who Bacall something wasn't right something was at conflict he murdered his brother you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right not just go around and tear down it you don't have to stick a knife and a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well as shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it what Jesus said guilty of it guilty of being a murderer a murderer like Moses and David and Paul and all these others but I'm thankful that God has made a way for the murderers you know brother branham and Smyrna in this murder in church age he says and here he is talking about the seven golden candlesticks walking in the midst of those who he meet whom he has redeemed even his church and what were those who were redeemed were not many like Paul murderers and corrupters were not many like the dying thief robbers and min killers all trophies his grace all brought back from the dead all made alive in Christ Jesus all made alive some gods overcoming power is able to take a murderer and transform them into something that he can use he can take somebody like Moses who was wandering in the desert and after 80 years God finally caught up with him and he could transform his life and equip him and put a sword in his hand or in this case a rod a stick and tell him how to use it what to do with it when to drop it and pick it up and how long to leave it on the ground give him knowledge of how to operate the gift and show him what to do with it God is able to transform and I just thank God for His grace I feel like I feel like you know like Dwight knew who I think it was white moody that he came running down from that from the from upstairs where he was arenas Bible and ask somebody do you know grace because grace is what we all need grace to extend it to the chiefest of sinners grace to the to the murderers and the sinners and that all the different all the long list of the ones where Paul said and such were some of you that God has transformed us by by the renewing of our minds to transform us from our own ideas and our private interpretations and our carnal interpretation of the scripture until we have the mind of Christ so we can see things the same way he does and you know what when you see things the same way that he sees it then you begin to love one another you begin to love your brother and sister and everything just begins to line up just exactly right now I don't want to leave Moses in the desert you know Moses is problem really the greatest enemy he had the greatest enemy that all of us have is when you look in the mirror the greatest problem that Moses had was himself and that's why God had to let him run around in the desert until he kind of he got all that let all that self die out and he was ready for God to deal with him maybe if he hadn't let him do that and and work you know let the hot burning Sun beat down I mean let it's a poor nag him and be to own him in you know sometimes you sometimes God will brother branham said this that God would give you a spouse or let you have a spouse to that would be the cross that you bear in life he might not have said it exactly that way but it is something to that effect so maybe he didn't say the cross that you would bear but something something like that it would be the thing it would be something to help you yes yeah it's in there somewhere it would be something that would be almost a blessing in disguise for you to strengthen you and help you to become in a place where God can deal with you so that you know that that you need God and all of those other things that go with that and not just spouses and now I'm not just talking about that but all all the different things in life because you know brother Bevin said that life is a struggle it's supposed to be a struggle it's supposed to be a hard thing work you just you you know sometimes going to church is hard sometimes it's hard dealing with people it's hard going to work is hard and it's supposed to be like that so that you don't get easy and complacent and me it's supposed to be a combative to this old layout of seeing spirit where you you get rich and increased with Goods and feel like you have need of nothing because if life is a struggle then it's a constant reminder that you need God if there's barely any money in the bank sometimes if there's the funds are low if the kids are always you know worrying about things that all kinds of things are happening everything's going wrong then you realize that you need God and it'll put you in the right and the right frame to approach him with and so Moses one day one day he's walking along and he and he chases a sheep or whatever you know that some of the 10 commandments or what kind of puts it he he's falling a little sheep up into the mountains and and something catches his eye and he sees a bush burning wonder what a strange thing but you know the see that's what that's what catches a lot of people's attention and they're so interested in the burning bush that they pay no attention to the voice they so much they're so interested in the signs and the wonders and the sensations and and having a nice experience and and just being a nice good Christian with the devil nice and happy inside of you but you know that you know brother Brennan said that the devil will get nice at home in your church nice and comfy and and because there's no revelation to boot him out there's nothing that there's no word that you're believing because you've got your own private and corporate interpretations there's nothing to give him the boot so the devil gets nice and comfy and he's sitting there in church having a good old time what was I talking about but so you see Moses he wasn't just looking he came for the burning bush like the like the believers did when they that the first pull and the second pool they came for those those kind of things but what brother branham was really after was the big rainbow trout that would be interested in the voice in that in the opening of the word and so when and the Bible says in Exodus chapter 4 when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see could you just imagine maybe dramatized it the Lord's called put the boot on bush on fire and he's black put the bait out there he's fishing he's fishing for believer he's fishing for Moses and he saw he turned aside to see yes I got him and that's what that's what that's why brother all those visions brother Branham had of the pools and all of those different things he's fishing he's fishing for the believer and he puts something attractive on the hook to get you to turn aside so that then you'll hear the voice and the voice is the main thing and listen I'm a Maria I'm gonna read this the scripture here but I just want to think of you of this that mo has heard the voice but then see God wanted to put the voice in Moses he wanted to make his lips the mouthpiece and that's what stumbles a lot of people a lot of people don't they they stumble over that you have a confession there that's how it works that you just speak the word then it comes out of your mouth that the bride would be the voice in this last day that the voice that God has delivered to us and has been spoken through a prophet that you would have anything to do with that nobody wants to have anything to do with it that's where the stumbling is is they they stumbled all over the voice the voice is the thing the voice is the key the main thing know and see Moses stumble to that he said but but I got a problem with my mouth and it's sometimes it won't work right you know I've felt personally myself oh yeah that's one thing I kind of struggled with growing up and everything you know you go through school and you feel like well my mouth won't work right my mind is thinking one thing and my mouth says another and you you start to develop a complex that it just won't come out right and everything and so maybe Moses you know it practice makes perfect and you know you get up in front of people and you start talking at work they had us get up and talk years ago and and you begin to you know your brain starts sinking up with your mouth but you know that was my problem Moses was willing to solve Moses as God was willing to solve Moses problem without any speech therapy without any any going to some class to learn how to talk without any all that kind of stuff God was gonna put his voice into Moses mouth and Moses had his own private interpretation of how that was supposed to work he said well I think is I think it's got to work like this I think I'm supposed to be a good speaker or I'm supposed to be a smart man or I'm supposed to have a lot of education or something like that but God God is able to take it literate fishermen and make something out of it so in verse nine abut Exodus four it says and it shall come to pass because he tells him about all the signs and Moses said him the Lord o my Lord I'm not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou has spoken under thy servant but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue maybe that's the kind of person God can use there's somebody that feels like III don't think I can do it this I don't know if this is gonna work but see Moses God wants somebody to believe him and the Lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth who or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord now therefore go and I will be with our mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say and then he objected again mmm and he said old my lord send I pray thee by the hand of whom thou will see him he's asking very politely and around about wings do it let somebody else do it and III think that's maybe our our problem a lot of times is you we try to find a way around just accept in the Word of God that's stepping out in faith and doing something for the Lord and so the angle of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said is not air and they leave I thy brother I know that he could speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet the end so he set up that situation where Aaron will be the spokesperson that he would put his voice in Moses mouth and then Aaron would be the voice would be in him as well and so he went down into Egypt and now now after that he had heard the voice now he was equipped to go do what he had done before without being equipped before he was a murderer because he was not equipped that he came out doing everything wrong everything didn't turn out right but now he had he had the knowledge and the understanding he had a staff in his hand that God had given him he had two signs and he had the word of the Lord and he knew what to do with that rod so when he came before pharaoh and pharaoh with no fear and pharaoh's standing there saying listen you can't be free your people can't be free and moses with the knowledge that he had he just took that rod and dropped it right in front of him and just stood back and and watched the drama take place and out come the pageant magicians and they do their impersonation thing see how the impersonation is just like today where there's an impersonation there's an anointing but there's not something on the inside to be able to frame the word correctly to be able to preach it without without error so that so that it will produce something and so they were able to impersonate it they were able to make it look like they had the goods but on the inside there was nothing to back it up but Moses had the goods he was able to back it up and he knew how it worked that's what knowledge is is not just a lot of head knowledge but the the understanding of how everything works and so he let go of the rod and he just over he'd already let go he just stood there and he watched God work and he was patient and he he watched God that that serpent you know his rod devoured the other two serpents because he knew how to handle that serpent he knew how to handle the devil see Moses was coming down to Egypt on a path of utter destruction ready to destroy the works of the devil ready to lay waste to sin ready to lay waste to everything that would hold the children of Israel back he was ready to liberate them and now he was equipped he had no fear and see Satan was there telling them you can't be free and that's a lot of the things that are going around the message today they're saying that the people of the message are not free that they're in bondage that they're doing things just because just because somebody tells them to and they don't have an understanding of what Liberty is you know real Liberty it's being a prisoner of Christ what God has you in change your change of love where you're like I don't want to do anything to hurt my brother or my sister or to hurt God and so God so Moses went down clearing a path of destruction and his and his failure kept resisted he would unleash another plague by the spoken word until finally it got this destroy in the path destroying everything and finally I got to the last plague which was the unleashing of the destroyer which is what the scripture says in Exodus 12 it says then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of hyssop that's how simple it is just take simple faith and apply the blood dip it in the blood that is in the basin and it strike the little and the two side posts with the blood is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of this house until the morning everybody had to stay under the blood under that token because of the destroyer was coming and when the destroyer comes it's not to hurt the children it's to liberate them to set them free for the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians and when you see at the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you that's over that's overcoming it's when God destroys all of the sin and all of the things in your life but the way that God does it the way that he doesn't even hear is by the word by laying out a word pass for them to follow you must apply the blood over the door you must do it with hyssop you must eat the lamb go in there eat it all what you don't eat burn it all of those things they had to do and then then then they were liberated and they they got all of the the gold and things from their neighbors they borrowed it and all they went God had equipped them for their journey and give them provision and then they got to the next great obstacle will God deliver us over this over this sea so we know that story that that through that through that deliverance God destroyed utterly all the Egyptians and that's I think that's what we're all struggling for through the opening of the word that God will destroy everything that's that's the experience of the new birth when you can look back like they did and look back to the past and see that your life has been changed and look back and see that the Egyptians have been destroyed in your life and when they got over on the other side that's when that's when Miriam and all of the women they took up timbrels and they begin to rejoice because listen when it's with God delivered what I think one of the one of my kids asked me that one time why do people sometimes they scream out in church what water sometimes people people let loose because God has delivered them on something when you get delivered of something there it'll produce it improves the reaction when you see grace in your life when you see that God has done something when you see the power of God working in your church and in your life then you realize that the the grace of God to you and it'll produce in a produced joy and a producer reaction but we don't want to go the opposite way and say well you got to jump up and down and you got to hop all around and all of that kind of stuff that's going in the wrong direction that's that's not right you want to you want to jump for the for a revelation you're not just because you want to maybe dramatic you think of all the times that think about this how Moses heard the voice and God put his voice in him and gave him the three signs he signed had a voice it spoke there was a message behind it and God wants to put his voice and you so you know the message and are able to speak it and confess it and that voice that voice destroys the enemy just like it did with Joshua in the Battle of Jericho remember how they gathered all around and they marched around all the different days and on the last day they gathered and they shouted with their their voice the the understanding that they had is what brought the walls down and everything came down except for the one just like in the in the that Old Testament story and that Exodus story except for the one that was under the token because that's what the destroying does that's what that that burning fire represents a consuming fire that's meant to burn out everything from your life except the things that are wrong or that are right to burn out all the wrong from your life to burn out everything that's sinful and and decadent and of the flesh worldly all those things and leave only a real Christian life we think about this story and when after they begin to journey through the wilderness in Exodus chapter 17 verse 8 through 14 it says they came upon the a Malayan and it says then came amalek and fought with Israel and were feed him and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go out fight with emilich tomorrow tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with a rod of God in Montana so Joshua did as Moses has said to him and fought with emilich and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand Emily prevailed but Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he set their own and Aaron and her stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomfiting emilich and his people with the edge of the sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the years of Joshua for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven and if a Mallick represents the things that plagued Israel it represents the things that plagued you in your life God is able to utterly destroy that out of your life but the problem is sometimes we don't back up the man that has his hands up the man with the ball you know we need we all need to back up our pastor and stand behind him and lift his hands up so that the enemy can be utterly destroyed so that the enemy can be completely destroyed and conquered and then in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy Moses was talking into chapter 7 he was talking about the when they came upon the God God told him about the Hittites and the girgashites and the Amur ice and the Canaanites and what they were supposed to do with them and the way he said to deal with him he said thus shall you deal with him you shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire and in other words have no mercy just destroy everything so that's what the power of God is doing power where the power of God is it's the revenue power comes from Revelation the revelation of his word the Pawel you know sometimes we think power comes from sensations and feelings and all that kind of stuff but power real power comes from a knowledge just like Moses had with his staff of whether to lift it up or whether to drop it or even having confidence that it would turn into a snake like he knew that God had showed into you and that's what power is that's a revelation and that kind of power is the kind of power that the gates of Hell cannot prevail against Matthew chicks 16 verses 13 through 19 that was you that was that was enacted right outside of Capernaum and if you go to Capernaum my brother-in-law was telling me this because he just got back from Israel and y'all had gone to Israel before you'd probably seen this as well they actually having there's an actual gates of Hell there where it's called the gates of hell a big old pit or something where they throw they used to throw goats in as a sacrifice to pagans and everything and they called it the gates of hell and so Jesus was standing dear in Capernaum when he told the story when this thing was enacted and and when sight when he asked him who do you say that I am and Simon Peter Simon Peter answered it said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God I know who you are and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and you talk about binding and loosing binding and loosing comes from the revelation of the power of God because what it will do is it will loose you from your captivity and it will bind the devil so that the devil cannot work it will loose you so that you can you can be free it like it loose the children of Israel the power of God through the revealed word and it will bind the devil like he destroy them with it with the water that there of the Red Sea crashing in on them and then destroyed them while it loose the children of Israel because what it will do it was it will it will constrain it will destroy all it works to the flesh the lust of the flesh the pride of life the enmity by the revealed word as you hear all these stories of the revealed word and you're being preached over the pulpit of the price paid the way to be born again the God had true oneness what eternal hell is Redemption what the shout boys trump is all these things that combined together together to give the church overcoming power overcoming powers with what God is wanting to equip the church with you know that's what the the disciples the disciples were running around scared before the day of Pentecost wondering what was that what hide and wondering if they had really you know if everything really had happened the way that it was supposed to and all those different kind of things but on the day of Pentecost they got equipped and you know how they got equipped they got equipped with a combat beasts that first combat beasts was a lion roared in the lion when here or the scares all the enemy you like brother been talked about they that that lion rose on the day of Pentecost because the lion those for combat beasts represent the overcoming power of the revealed word in the bride fighting to destroy the works of the enemy that lion reared his head because they were armed with the power of that combat beast they were armed with the things that Paul talked about in Ephesians 6 where he said finally my brother and be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your Lauren's gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ecl be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and I'll just finish on this so the musicians can go ahead and come forward what we need to do to get that overwhelming oh that that overcoming power is you know when you come to church it's like going to the doctor and when you go to your doctor and the doctor says well don't take this drug or don't you got to take all the penicillin don't just take some of it because that'll cause a big old problem there back to you or rise up and they'll get stronger and all that kind of stuff you got to listen to your doctor if it'll work right and so when you come to church you got to listen to the doctor and the best thing that can happen to us is for is for something to be uncovered for something to be for you to find the remedy when you go to the doctor if the doctor says well this is you got a problem here you got a tumor or whatever it needs to be cut out or some kind of something that needs to be remedied then you could do something about it and so well I was just seeing right there let's just stand
