one thing we want to get out of him we want to know what to what the Lord has for us and we sure appreciate the Lord for letting us even live say some people did not make it through the day today lady pulled out right up here a couple days ago with J Moore and I don't know her but I don't know ever and here in Lula and she passed so you just don't know but just keep these people in prayer September

know all heard all that um having to get her up out of the floor and all that stuff and um we just pray they'll give her strength and I don't have any results back from my test from Friday so no news is good news so we will uh let you know what's going on and um we just believe all is well anyway so we're we're I'm not worried about it so I just don't like to go to the doctor I don't like to get prepped I don't like to get shot I don't like to get gassed you understand what I'm talking about are you well if you live long enough all right let's go to the son of man part 127 uh tonight we're going to speak a little bit back on our uh subject that we were talking about of metamorphosis we'll continue a little bit more because what started out looking one way ended up looking another way but it was the same life it was the same person isn't that what's happening to me and you the man that's what's happening to us in our life it's the metamorphosis of God that has changed us from the inside out and that's what it is with the the caterpillar and all that the the butterflies already in there even in the little egg the butterflies in there somewhere the big beautiful wings and all the pretty things and we know that that well we'll look at there's it's kind of funny there's four stages to the butterfly and there's four stages to our restoration of of the word back in power in the end time uh brother Brown said you know four deaf Messengers ate it the tree down in four life Messengers will bring it back so we'll talk about that just a little bit but those four life Messengers intertwined in that is these virtues because what's what started on the day of Pentecost is definitely what's going to carry us through all right the Holy Ghost falling in a group of Believers and they acted like Jesus Christ all right you can take the seals of all the plagues Daniel 70 weeks you can take all that and we've we know we preached it right here and we know that it's being taught well but if we don't live the life that's where brother Brown said we're we're missing it we're missing it on that life and even Paul said you can know all Mysteries and not have charity which is the new birth then you're a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so let's bow our heads and remember these ones that are not here we'll miss seeing them Lord I pray that you'd be with each one Lord Susan's mom Lord we forgot about her Lord just bless her where she's at now father I pray that you would just touch each one that's not here with us Lord there's many ones that are sick there's many ones that are struggling Lord let's let's not forget those that are struggling Lord to even try to get to church father and I pray that you'd be with them Lord give them a spark in their heart father and give us a renewed spark tonight Lord and give us something you said you would receive power so Lord after the Holy Ghost has come Lord let's let's just release some of that power tonight Lord it'll help each and every one of us Lord maybe not so much as as screaming and scouting and speaking in tongues and all these things but we'll have a settling in our heart that when we go home and and when the storm clouds gets real bad like it was this morning it looked really bad all of a sudden the sun breaks through father I pray the Breakthrough in our life tonight Lord and that whatever gloominess that we've seen Lord before in the day before we walked in this door it'll be done away with Lord Into Sunshine the s-o-n will shine Lord and give us that warmth that we need to fight the battle for us to get out of here with Lord and I pray that you'd bless us and eat bless brother Dale sister Dale bless the bride around the world Lord all the ministers and ones that were acquainted with Lord we pray that you touch each one Lord bless him in Jesus name amen the Bible says John 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh it's not a substitute it's not we're looking for somebody else I'm looking for my flesh to be used by God I'm looking for your flesh to be used by God and not just to be used by God because a sinner can be used by God Gibson callings we'll look at in just a minute Gibson Collins are without repentance but if God ever dwells inside of you and uses your flesh that's him using your flesh and it is not you it is not I that liveth Paul said but what Christ that liveth in me all right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth we'll read one more and you'll be seated John 3 verse 3 says Jesus answered the sin unto him verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see or understand and literally he's not going to be able to see you're not going to heaven if you don't have the new birth I mean you're not going in that City if you don't have the new birth you're not going to be bride if you don't have the new birth that's the kingdom of God all right you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word and we've continued on now I want to um break this down just to just a little bit I looked in the uh um online and was was we've always shown this as being born again which is an ongoing thing but I want to I want you to read something that that that that you know that word being could be you you're a being all right but it is a it is a I don't know where they call it an adjective or something but it it's something else it's an action word it's being born again you're you're being activated or you're you're you know you're being reborn or being born again and Paul tells us being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible so how can we take something corruptable and make it incorruptible by the word of God all right by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever and that word being born again is begott again or be born again or to produce again all right now what's going to happen when we look at this when we look at this butterfly now remember the butterfly the cycle of the butterfly the butterfly the adult butterfly lays an egg it looks nothing like the butterfly don't go to sleep already all right it don't look nothing like it the next stage don't look nothing like it the next stage don't look nothing like it but that last stage it reproduces itself come on somebody it reproduces itself it's Reborn and then you see exactly what planted a seed in the first place so to produce again are born Anew so every day we need a being born again we need something that is renewing us as Paul says by the renewing of your mind how you going to renew your mind you're not going to renew it with anything but the word of God preaching teaching and speaking of the word of God and praying and reading your Bible all right it's the only way you're going to get it you're not going to get it any other way so you can try to find it somewhere else but it's not you're not going to find it you might find a substitute I was talking to a girl um she's a phenomenal Christian girl there we're at home and and she said you know she said before my daddy passed away he was a Pentecostal preacher um he said you know he said he started watching Joyce Myers and see if he got more out of Joyce Meyers than anybody either I said a Pentecostal got anyway so I just kind of looked at her and a little strange and didn't say anything I didn't want to burst or bubble but you see that's what they're leaning to they're leaning to a feeling or an emotion or somebody popular somebody you know it's got you know a crowd of people and and they've got 50 000 views on YouTube or or what more and and you know you look at Joyce Meyers and her hair is about shorter than mine and and you know what brother Brown said about a short-haired woman a bob-head woman so I I just don't have any time for that you know what spend my time looking at the word of God I wish those people that were bashing brother random and believe the sign people I wish they'd spend as much time showing their gospel if our gospel is wrong show me yours don't don't show me 30 minutes of why yours is wrong or mine's wrong you know give me something give me something to help something to edify and look and help us being born again all right because it's a renewing it is a renewing it's something that how many times have we been through life and we've done something done something then we used to do it every day then we used to do it every week and then we started doing it every month and then well didn't you I I just got tired of that well the word of God should never be that way the word of God should be that that I want to be here to where if I listen to a minister and he says something and it Sparks me and I go and I I study on it or I or I um meditate on something and that's the way you should do you say well that's just for the ministers no that's what we're here for is to stir you up so that you'll study where I don't have to study for you all right and you you have to write the man you can do your own studying you have your own books you have your own tapes you have your own prayer life all right you must be born again brother Brown says now God bless his word and I want to take the subject this morning in Jesus's first Doctrine now his first Doctrine now if it was his first Doctrine then it must be our first Doctrine you must be born again that was his first Doctrine we find out that there are so many different meanings I've been talking about this but there is I want you to get it out of your mind it is being justified it is being Sanctified it is coming to the New Birth and continuing on that is the new birth is the continuation of the word of God being made alive in your life hey brother Bob stands here on Sunday teaching Sunday school and and last Sunday you know in that 30 minutes brother Bob did a an outstanding job I've been on I've been on brotherly kindness for you know three or four or five sermons and he popped it all in 30 minutes so uh and that's just God I mean and it Sparks your attention and he gets it gets you to study it again all right don't ever leave a subject every subject's got something connected with the other one don't leave one you just come back to the because you're going to come right around to the same subject again and if you know the Bible even tells us if you're plowing in a field don't look back right no look by if you're plowing in the field you get in that Furrow and you plow don't look back because if you look back what you're going to do you're going to be like this but stay in that Furrow if we're in that Furrow of Brotherly kindness man I you know I did I said there Sunday and I said good grief I didn't touch pieces of it from some of the things that brother Bob was bringing out about brotherly kindness brother kindness is the deep subject brother kindness is the subject that's right up there at the very top and it's very narrow and it's going to be hard for us to get to that and through that why because we're contrary even born again believers you're still contrary to the word of God you're still born and sin you can't get away from that you you have a carnal mind all right and that's enmity to God so you got to get that mind get the mind of Christ to override that mind all right and don't be double-minded right now the Bible tells us about a double-minded man we find that there's many different meanings that people put to that nearly all churches say You must be born again that's kind of the basis of Christianity but what are they saying I read a few I looked up being born again in on a Googled it and and my there is I mean you can read for days what the definition of being born again is but thank God he sent us a prophet that told us when Jesus stood said you must be born again he says if he said what inside of you a Grace with the word for your day in other words brings you to church makes you read your Bible makes you study do the things of the of the word of God to me that is my only I mean how are you going to do it by feelings how are you going to do it by any emotion How You Gonna you can't but it is by an experience there's got to come a day folks when it's just like reaching and getting that doorknob there's a key there's a knob and there's a bolt that goes in that door all right that is the integral parts of a doorknob well that's the integral parts of being born again but what do you got to do you got to go over there and turn that knob something happened right this is old you that's your birth that's that's too simple well guess what I wish you could make it that simple you took what you got turned it you hear that it opened that Bolt and you let somebody in but but without that without the Turning of that Bolt the same you stand at the door so it's an experience I had an experience you saw me walk over there and open that door and what'd it do it changed the atmosphere actually when I opened it it did change the atmosphere because that hot air started coming in but it changed the atmosphere it changed where I was and it would change my whole point of this whole room when that door opened because anything can come in anything can get out so nearly all churches say You must be born again but each one has their different interpretation well you just saw ours it's opening the door turn the doorknob but it's an experience that you have so you can put it with whatever you want to put it with but it's got to be you got to say this is where I was born again at every one of your sisters know exactly where you were when you gave birth to your children no I can't remember you may have been knocked out for days but you can still remember where you're at but that's the experience you had an experience of childbirth all right so how do you interpret it I would go to each church and then his brother I'm telling just a whole Congregation of of denominational people look there's gotta be one way there must be a truth somewhere so now remember it didn't say you ought to be it says You must now you must be born again 1961. as I was saying before about the door that and that doorknob stays the same until you turn it it's locked all right you still are what you are until you're born again of the spirit of God it does not change you what saying a Creed coming to church reading your Bible even that it will but your Creed joining the church change your idea a lot of people are at that point they just have good intentions all right or as we say find Jesus in jail you just get caught doing what you're doing you get feel sorry about it and you feel sorry for getting caught not that somebody that was a devil in there that made you do it and guess what you're going to go right back and do it again but that new birth is an experience something that takes place there was something that turned that opened up a door that God could get inside of you and do what not just move you over not just move you over kill you fire Holy Ghost and Fire he's going to burn that thing out and he's literally in your soul he is rebirthing you I don't care if you're 90 years old as the woman was she was 90 something years old when she came to the lord well when she got born again God didn't put a 92 year old woman back in there no he renewed her he made her to where that her theophany just changed right to a young person I just I just believe that because how you gonna get the eternal life that you're going to live in for an eternity and it's be old the reason you're old is because your mom and daddy brought you here but when that Soul comes inside of you and God changes not exchange he didn't kill your soul he kills and burns that nature that you had because you had a carnal mind because you came from sex just like the next person did and the next person did and everybody in here come from the same Act and you're dying because of that one act but if you're sitting here today born again you were made alive by the same act right and that's God birthing you into the body but the reason we have to be born again because the Bible teaches us that we're all born in sin shaped and iniquity see that's why I love about brother Brown he just lays it out there he said I was born in sin a prophet I was going to hell he didn't say now I'm different I'm special I'm Malachi 4. no he did not he said I'm lost he said everybody's lost till they're born again we're all together wrong to begin with and there's nothing we can do about it there's nothing we can do about getting here wrong but there is something we can do about getting here right while we're here now all right everybody with me on this now remember all those people they were what we call Abraham the father of our faith I was thinking about this the other day about Moses and different ones sometimes maybe the Lord will let you if you'll ask him he'll let you just really get into the life of that person and that may just be me but I just kind of got into you know you get into the life of Moses and you get into that and what we read is okay but there was a God that was motivating that all right so that same God that spoke to him at the burning bush is the one that spoke to me the day I got born again and he's not just living around me or with me he's inside of me all right see that's something Moses couldn't say because Moses wanted to meet him he wanted to know where he was he wanted to figure him out though he made him at a burning bush but he met fire he didn't meet a person he wanted to meet a person but because of the blood of bulls and goats he couldn't see that person Faith remember he saw his back part he said you can't see my face and live well guess what we can see his face today and live when you get born again you're looking at the face of God if you're really born again but all these having a good report all these different ones that the whole Old Testament is just full of these people neither one of them are born again not a one of them got their old nature burnout and the nature of God put in that person no there was gifts it was Gifts of anointings of coming on and coming off we're going to see here in just a few minutes even Jesus told the 12 disciples he said I'm going to give you power to lay hands on the sick preach the gospel and Judas was there and remember he didn't have nothing in him but the devil obviously all right everybody with me but he gave him power like Susie excuse you he gave him an anointing he gave him something to work with but when you get dunamis power is where Peter didn't need Jesus the day at the gate beautiful come on he didn't need the person he had that person inside of it he said Silver and Gold Have I None but I have received that promise God having some better things for us to stay without us cannot and will not be made perfect without a group of people because remember as we were talking before and I was listening brother random the other day he said everybody got a piece listen we're not peace people p-i-e-c-e we're full adoption every joint supplied everything that moves is God everything that breatheses God in this end time we are looking at The Headstone the head we are not looking at pieces of the body as God saw pieces of the body and was happy when Martin Luther you know he did that in October I think what was it October he put those thesis 95 thesis but remember his new birth is not your new birth as far as that part of the word all right just shall live by faith all right not anything of sanctification but remember it was the butterfly adult had planted an egg all right so potentially that was a butterfly potentially it was headed toward full word potentially when I put corn in the ground if the stinking deer don't eat it all we're going to eat them vegetables they might be in a different form but I have got zero P's zero okra and they beat the tops off my corn they're dying I'm gonna eat them peas and all but it may be in a form of meat but I'm gonna eat them things but they tore my garden up bad but anyway so but what I planted I had I had good intentions but what I planted was going to come up The Corn was supposed to come up to a grain and then that grain you dried it out and put it up and next year you planted it it looked like what went in the ground but the stages all did not look like that one grain of of corn but that life of the grain of corn was inside there and that's what we're going to look at in just a minute that's the same thing with our birth and then when being born again when we look at these virtues they must be something special that is given to us all right because not everybody's going to get them listen the potential for the butterflies there but when you get to that caterpillar stage if a caterpillar does not eat it will not produce a butterfly yet it is a caterpillar and got a butterfly inside of it it will die because it's not eaten that's 238 Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift the Holy Ghost for that promises unto you and to your children to all that are far off and even means our Lord Our God shall call Our Promise is not again it's not partial promise our promise is full Authority full nature of God full headstone not pieces or parts man right that's our mandate that's what I come to church for sure I come to church to get my little portion but my little portion is a hundred percent of what I need and I'm heading toward and you are heading toward a peace you're starting with a peace but you're heading to a full body you're going to be the one that's going to see the perfection we're the ones that's going to be able to see I just believe in the name of the Lord we're going to be able to see the body change we're going to be able to look at it and become part of it not just say oh that's for another age there is no other age this is it I mean listen I was thinking about this so that's a little bit carnal but you watch a football game and it's like 60 Minutes long all right so you watch a football game and and you know they're out there and they and they got like 30 or 45 seconds to run a play you know in there they just take your dear sweet time until the last two minutes of the game right in the last two minutes of the game they know oh when that clock goes zero zero zero game's over but before that they're looking at 59 58 57 you know they're looking at 59 minutes they're like we're good come on hike the ball but last two minutes it's a flurry especially if you're behind right you watch any kind of game any kind they get right up to the last inning or the last play of the last few minutes of a soccer game or something like that and I couldn't tell you the first minute or last minute of a soccer game but they call it football too huh Adam I don't know ain't football but think about it that's what we're at now this is it there is no other quarter there's no other game there's no other time and listen we don't even get overtime if you go into overtime you are a foolish virgin and you didn't win the game all right this is it we're coming to the zero zero zero now I believe that the reason that there's so much confusion about the Holy Spirit is not correctly tall so let's just continue on because we know we were just talking about it but we're thank God for a proheart with that nature that you were born with contrary to God every bit of it was contrary to God I don't care how sweet and nice and wonderful you are without the new birth and without God putting something in you your dad take the Stony heart out of your flesh he's the only one that can do that and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit listen to me that's god making sure that you make it if you take something imperfect and put something perfect in it you're gonna make it amen he's going to make sure you're going to make it that's where election and predestination and foreknowledge all comes together somebody's going to make it he saw somebody want it so bad so he didn't put you in Luther's age he didn't put you in Wesley's age he puts you in Pentecost he puts you 60 years ago in a prophet's message sitting in the Tabernacle or whatever more he put you right here more blessed is him that what have not seen and believe all right but he's going to make sure we're going to make it he said I'm going to put my spirit within you and cause you you know if I put a spirit of uh sister Barbara's not here tonight so I'll talk about her just I'm sure she's watching but she's so Meek and Mild I have to get real close to listen yeah I know y'all do too not one of y'all never heard her talk loud not a one amen you're all like what oh I got okay what really excited the other day can you speak up a little bit but that's just her but put me inside of her now wouldn't that be because you're going never but that's what God does though he puts himself inside of you and makes you act like him right she's probably passed out now on the floor Sister Barbara he's okay you'll not have to be like me I can talk I can talk loud so you don't have to but that's what God does or if we'll believe that we're supposed to remember there's Christians in Antioch they called them Christians because they acted like Christ there was a group of people that had you know even from afar off saw this man named Jesus didn't understand him but saw his life for 30 years probably didn't even believe in him but he they then he disappears come on somebody he disappears goes off the scene we don't know what happened to him we think he went out in the desert we think this happened we think they stole his body or they well now he just went up and come right back down in those people and made them Act like he acted so they connected the two together they must have been around that man Jesus because they're acting just like him Peter says Silver and Gold Have I done but such as I can call the Bishop no he didn't say that churches I have today give unto you amen I like what Peter Peter was you know how he was real he's always with bold but he said you know he walks by and he walked by this guy and he says this guy's you know wanting alms and all this stuff Peter being Peter he looked at him and he said look on us wasn't making him anything but what he was doing was doing just like where brother Brandon would do be still look up here brother Adam said you look up here he said now if I tell you to close your eyes you close your eyes he said I take every Spirit In My Control in this building all right well that's what Peter was doing he was he was taking the scene and he was controlling the scene he said look on us he said now what I got I'm fixing to give you I don't have enough to pay you doctor bills I can't heal you but I know there's one inside of me that will if you'll just calm down and look on us think about that there's a lot of times and I and I'm not for it or against it and it has its time but but all this jumping and dancing and singing and shouting and running the owls that there is a place for that but I believe when somebody needs to get healed or gets prayed for it needs to be quiet getting to be it needs to be it you tell me one time where brother Branham ever said now y'all just continue screaming and shouting no he's always saying calm down sit down I'll read it to you I read it to you last Wednesday sit down he said the Holy Ghost is timid he said you need to sit down sit still don't move now he didn't mind him praising the Lord you saw on that movie where that black sister stood up and he said thank God for you black people praising the Lord you know which was fine but it wasn't the whole building where you couldn't even hear what brother Brown was saying there's got to be a control to it where where Peter says look hey look right here look look at us all right so let's continue on but that's just something we need to be taught more of maybe to get more out of it I've just seen you know for nine years June and I were were counselors at camp at Alabama and and the same ones every year came to the altar screamed shouted you know fell out XYZ whatever you want to say and then they disappeared you'd see him a year same two years and then gone hear that they were out in the world you know doing XYZ well maybe if somebody would have got down there and and talked to him one-on-one just talk to them said hey you know be still don't be just don't be screaming y'all don't get quiet if you want to but that's just the way I see that the Lord deals with us there is a time to rejoice and scream and shout amen there is a time for that but you got to know what you're screaming and shouting for getting these meetings and the people are already shouting amen before the guy even preaches well he could say 10 things wrong and they'd be shouting already all right Luke 24 49 says behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high that word in dude means to put on clothes with a raid in or be clothed in a sense of sinking into a garment which is dunamis power which is inherent power now that's what we want because we are inheritors all right but now this other power is when we called him he gave 12 disciples power against unclean spirits cast them out heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now that powers exosia or he he gave them Authority but what happened with that Authority when they hung Jesus on the cross where'd that Authority go they weren't even around at his death they scattered everywhere and Judas is the one that turned him in so he had exclusive power which was power that came on and off just like we would at a meeting or anything like that you would have power it's even Power of Choice Liberty to do as one pleases the Lord Jesus gave them Liberty to heal the sick raise the dead do all the different things he gave them power which was a temporary power but then what happened it didn't stay on them it just went away but now in the day of Pentecost that dunamis power that came and went inside of them is the one that gave Peter authority to do what he did he didn't need exclusive power anymore he had xoc I mean he had the dunamis power not the EXO see he had dunamis power and he walked around with it you and I got to realize we walk around with the power of God every second of our life if you're born again believe me if you're born again you've got the power over the devil inside of you waiting to be used not waiting to to come to church where you can get anointed it's good to be here you should and you will if you're a Christian John truly baptized with water and this is Peter I mean this is Paul but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not me today I mean this is Jesus you'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and then that's what happened they went to the death on up on the day of Pentecost but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you because what happened this quote from Brother Branham is just I I used to underline it a lot when I was reading a church age book because it says remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of what happened in the book of Acts so I just gave you examples Paul Peter John James all the different ones but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into that church the real Church defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless what teach that the Holy Ghost was in a wafer or in a priest or in the preacher or in this or in that and not in them like what somebody said the other day and it's true uh but the denominations uh and the one denominations in this message you know they can get Jesus to to be our savior and and to you know to down across for us but they can't really get them inside of them they look back at something happen and said well he died on the cross but they can't get that same man because if that same man would go inside of them that would be the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth and it would change them they would not have exclusive power they would have dunamis power but they don't but it's made but it's made the church called formal powerless so but look at this the kingdom of God is the word of God made back in power whatever you can think about what brother random did he came to bring the power back in the church because the word of God was so diluted it was so changed praise the Lord it was man had got involved with all their ideas and their doctrines with no Paul he says look if you received the Holy Ghost since you believe I wish somebody would go around all the message churches and preach that have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message since you've come into this I don't want to say tent and cause you to have a tent Ministry tent Vision sorry don't believe in none of that this is the tent that I'm worried about I'm not worried about some tent coming over this way all right right I know we all are I just want to make sure somebody on the video knows that uh we ain't looking for no tent we are the town of God but if you're seeing the Holy Ghost since you believe this message since you sat for years and years and years like brother Dale always said and it's so profound he said I'd rather come to church drag my nails all over the girl you know pulling myself in and say God give me the Holy Ghost God give me the new birth and to find out I had it already than to come in and oh bless God I'm I'm gonna sit over next to Bob because I know I know me and Bob got it you know and I'm gonna sit next to him did y'all realize something Sunday do you realize something I'll tell you how let me tell you how let me tell you how people work look at all his pictures that he put up except for one it was a man with a beard you go look at it and say I thought man a bunch of guys with beards in it because Bob was teaching because he had a beard that's why but it's what you see and there's nothing wrong with that but I was just going man they all got beards hey the greatest preacher I ever knew had a beard that's what I told Dan daisley one time he told me he said if you'll shave your beard he said I'll let you preach for me I said well the best preacher I ever heard in my life the greatest preacher on the face of this Earth had a beard he said who in his little wife she's a Hispanic lady she's sitting there and I said Jesus Christ and she said I guess he told you so I preached for him a couple weeks later so have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message since you've come in and and got the to me got the emotion out of the way got to got everything just just laid out get under some good teaching get under some good Revelation all right because look these people said look we've been preaching this message for years we don't know what you're talking about they you need to get the Holy Ghost we thought it was the message no it's not but then we look in Ephesians 4 says let no corrupt now you say how can I grieve the Holy Spirit Paul lays it out in verse 29 and 31. if you'll watch Paul when he's writing his letters remember he's writing letters he's not this is not verse 29. or verse 30s everybody understand what I'm talking about this is not Ephesians 4. man put those in there and put those breaks in that but it was a continual letter so Paul's listen continue a letter all right let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace into the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sailed until the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and wrath he's continuing his thought he's telling you if you have bitterness you've grieved the Holy Spirit if you have wrath you've grieved the Holy Spirit if you have corrupt communication you've agreed the Holy Spirit am I okay with that is that all right no anger if you if you're angry Holy Spirit go down a limb clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all malice now watch this is how you bring him back and be you kind brother Bob reading this Sunday be a kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you brother Brown said possession against the enemy 1959 says see the holy spirit is so timid he said be reverent keep quiet now you see he's in prayer line be reverent everybody now just be real Reverend keep quiet see the holy spirit is so timid how many knows that just real timid the Holy Spirit see just any little Interruption bothers him any interruption of that what I just listed of Paul the malice and the strife and the clamor and all get that out of the way it will bother him but we want to get him back guess what do the reverse of whatever that was okay so let's get on to something else right here let's look at this let's look at the anointings of the gifts let's read First Corinthians 12. verse four I kind of this is what I added in when I was sitting in there but now there are diversities of gifts look but the same spirit so we're not getting away from the Holy Spirit we're not getting away from that new birth that we had when we when we got born again you got the new birth now but there are diversities of gifts all right and there are differences of Administrations but the same Lord not everybody can be a deacon or a preacher or Pastor or Elder they're all different diversities but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man and woman sister to profit with all in other words all the whole Community or the whole church but the manifestation of spirit is given to every man the prophet with all for 2-1 is given by the spirit the word of wisdom it didn't say everyone it said one and that don't mean like one with your finger but one among you one among us all right because listen there's some Among Us me included that don't have all these virtues 100 percent remember we get 30 60 and 100. some get 30 some get 60 some get a hundred some of you have had your temper completely wiped out some of us have not for one is given by the spirit of wisdom Word of Wisdom look to another all right now to another the spirit moves over into another vessel all right to another the word of knowledge look by The Same Spirit though that's how they agree it keeps the same spirit and they agree as the Bible says in one all right to another Faith because look you can look at this in Corinthians and I don't know if this is when when Paul and and and Barnabas had their difference or when Paul and Peter had their difference I don't know the chronology of the writing but remember it was the same they weren't they weren't diverse in Doctrine it was just a little human something that they didn't agree with everybody with me okay all right now listen it's not gonna be peaches and cream I'll promise you that because we're all different to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith watch he keeps saying by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing look by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues or different kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self-sane spirit in other words that these gifts gift look dividing to every man severally as he will all right so remember the reason I'm telling you this is because there's two sets of gifts now watch these gifts can be interpreted and they can be not interpreted they can be the devil can brother Brown said pass out spiritual gifts all right because they're not predestinating gifts they're gifts that's given with all to the body all right and gifts and callings or that you just got to remember that but see he may give brother Donnie the gift of wisdom but when Brother Don he's finished with that gift of wisdom I say finished when God's finished with whatever you need to do it may go over to brother Tony everybody with me but it's the same Holy Spirit if they're not if they're not both born again that same spirit's not going to carry it over there okay so you understand what I'm saying we all have diversity of gifts but there is a predestinated as brother Dale said and I've read them read you the quote the predestinated gifts of God stay that way all the time they don't change and that's the fivefold ministry I don't see how in the world people are trying to get that out and it's a predestinated gift it's actually the only one that can't be interpreted by the devil if they preach the word right it can't be imitating yeah well you can have false preachers and teachers but if you have a pre I'm talking about predestinated by God amen if it's predestinated by God he's going to use those vessels in his way and it's going to be right 100 of the time all right remember these gifts are speaking in tongues and interpretation is not always right come on brother Brown was talking about different things like that he said he said you need you got an evil spirit in your church if that if it's one prophesies or interprets and and it gets all confusing he said that's not the Holy Spirit Galatians 5 verse 22 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith let's go right back now to the statue of perfect man meeting his Temperance look against there's such there's no law it's not even covered by the law because it's the fruit of the spirit of God love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness Faith meeting his Temperance against such there is no law in other words there's therefore now no condemnation because what was the law given for the law was given to condemn you sure Paul is telling us there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are not above the law no no no no no no but have made the law a Living Word of God are you getting it made the law not dead away with the law Jesus couldn't do away with the word of God he came under the law to make it honorable to make it to where if you were born again you're not going to want to kill somebody Commander adultery all those different things but watch there's a group of people just for a minute there's a group of people that's going to use these gifts wrong but they think they're using them right not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many shall he didn't say a few many brother John many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not what prophesied cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works they didn't do it in the name of the devil they did in the name of God with a different motive and without the new birth they got an anointing they didn't receive the Holy Ghost after they believed they just believed the message and went on with it that's hard to say but you preached this message for 30 or 40 years and walk away from it and say it's wrong you didn't get the new birth I can tell you thus saith the Lord you didn't get the new birth no cause a new birth the New Birth the power of God the dunamis of God will never ever now you can say I don't understand it but you can never deny what came in this end time and be born again no way no way can they come back that's up to God all right and in thy name done many wonderful words even maybe baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus did Mighty Works in their name and then I'm professing to you I never knew you I knew of you but I didn't know you intimately because an intimate relationship of God is when that God comes inside of you I know we all understand what I'm talking about comes inside of you and has an intimate relationship with you and you too become what one he said depart from Ye Ye that work iniquity wow please Lord don't let us be any of that group I want to be that group where he smiles at us and says hey you made it you made it you made it in the worst age and the worst time he he I put this one together with this one I put this one together with this one I brought one from South Carolina and one from I brought one from California and one from Georgia I bought one from the Philippines hmm put them back together to put you right here knowing that you'd make it no one you wouldn't fail knowing you would do everything in your power to do what this message said see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man though but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the soul is darkest pitch false teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the word that's what does it can we stand that can we stand that a preacher would come in here and and say bring me all your cancers and bring me all your diabetes and all your kidney stones bring me up bring me and I'll guarantee you you'll walk out whole but William Branham was not the prophet of the end time I don't believe in that water baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ what are you going to do with it it's already happening but what are you going to do with it are you going to get caught up at emotion and say boy he he heals he must be right no it's the word and the word only bottom line that's my brother came I believe he straightened it out that's a true word of God get it right they'll do the same signs the anointing ones they'll do the same signs but the words what separates them keep listening somewhere they'll have to go off they all prophesied they all done this that and the other what am I getting at listen you can imitate some of these gifts some of these we call virtues you can you can self-will yourself into different things right I I've lost almost 50 pounds I self-will myself from eating potatoes and and and self-will ain't got nothing to do with God makes me feel a little bit better but I can self-will myself too back to 250 pounds from 200 so or 205 or something or they're like that but anyway but that's just my willpower this is not willpower this is not willpower now my dog my granddaughter Deanna she spent the night with us Monday night and we'll use it for an example it's a little carnal but it's an example um and and I always like math so what I would do when she was a little kid I would do math problems and I didn't just do little ones I did like 750 584 times seven what's the answer you know some big and she would have well anyway so she has now she has an average in math of 105. in the 10th grade 105. it's better than me I don't know him how to get to 105. she got bonus questions but there was a teacher told me right here in Lula when she was starting up in in the school and got into like fifth or fifth or sixth grade I think they go to the seventh or eighth grade anyway it was up here at Lula and that teacher come to me and he said he said you know what Mr Dale he said he said you ought to be proud of your grandma or your granddaughter because of one thing he said now some of those people and I think about this in the spiritual sense some of these kids that I have he's math teacher he said some of these kids in my in my uh gray in my grade or my class they do it by repetition not that they know what's going on they've just done it so long they do it right by repetition he said but now your granddaughter he said I he said he said when I tell her something he said it he said it just doesn't he said it sinks down somewhere and she understands it so well why because she had good teaching before because math is really just numbers and it's zero through nine there's no other numbers but zero one two three four five six seven eight nine you all know that there's not any mystery ones oh they got A's and B's and and C's and squares and all that stuff but still it's still zero one two three four five six seven eight nine but with Deanna same way she was taught well to begin with but it wasn't that she was doing it by repetition she was understanding that if you take a quarter and a quarter you take one-fourth and one-fourth you've got a half all right then you continue on with a half and three quarters and to the hole and and you get and he said it just clicked with her he said I don't have to tell her twice he said I can do a problem tell her how to do it and he said half the class will just do it because of repetition they just do it because I did said but your daughter understands and can carry it on further well now she's in the 10th grade and it's showing same way we should do in the spiritual aspect listen we were not born to be able to be math majors but when you get born again get born again you got the teacher you know what the Bible says he puts the teacher inside of you I can't understand this I can't understand this that brother Louise he's not here tonight but he'll tell you and it is hard you go back and watch some of brother Dale's tapes back when and and and it's hard to hard to understand because he was a teacher and he broke everything down and if you tried to go in that direction he already had a roadblock up he tried to go in that direction he already had a roadblock up right am I am I correct so that taught us well so we use that teaching not a repetition well I'm coming to church because you'll come to a place though where your grades will get bad if you just do it by repetition brother Louise said I sat here for almost six months in this church and he said I didn't understand nothing your daddy was saying he said but I stuck it out he said I stuck it out and he said finally the pieces started coming together one piece at a time one Marshall at a time one piece of bread at a time one whatever you want so if you've got questions today just keep plugging along don't quit listen God never quits if you quit it's you and the devil would love for you to be a quitter but God would love for you to sit here stay under the fountain get wet long enough if you got the Holy Ghost listen he promised he'd teach you what was going on he promised almost he would as you say one day Lord you promised me my children if I are brother Bob or brother Louise or brother Aaron preach something or some other minister comes and preach and you say I just don't understand that just hang in there you just go on your prayer closet and say God you promised me that if I would make myself available you'd put somebody in the Pulpit to answer all my questions can we do that but look they'll do the same signs but the word is what separates them they all prophesied they all done this the others sure just the same Jesus said they'd do the same but the word is what separated them notice not signs everybody with me so let's look right here let's go real quick it's 8 20. let's continue on well we know what the battle of Armageddon is we are going through it right now you are going through a battle of Armageddon well if you're not pray for me and you better pray for yourself coach surprise coming now the battle started in heaven it'll be finished on Earth in the form of Armageddon but it will be on in me and you before that right now look but watch here's a promise I never have got to this but in Daniel 12 there is a time of trouble called Jacob's trouble and then that's going to be and when we're gone and we're in the marriage supper it's not for the Gentiles but I think the Bible still The Book of Daniel is talking to me but God's going to stand up and fight for Israel now listen if God listen to me if God's going to stand up Michael who is Christ is going to stand up for the children of thy people which Daniel's people was what Jews right now what more is he going to stand up and fight for a son and daughter these are not Sons and Daughters of God you are a son and daughter of God he will stand and fight for you if you later but the problem is we try to fight our own battles am I getting somewhere we try to fight our own battles we try to do it our own self no there shall be a time of trouble such as never right now is your time of trouble right now is your battle right now is your Armageddon are your trials of of of uh beating it out and brother Tom falbush He blesses heart a lot of you didn't know him but it was Donnie's dad and he used to sit right there third row big Burly guy he was Mr tough but when he got in front of my dad he was Mr wimp wasn't he because he loved my dad every morning at General Motors he drove a eight ton Hollow to bring daddy a cup of coffee all the way through thinner Motors all the way through that 100 Acre through that Hundred Acre um plant here he comes what old diesel popping with that coffee in his hand to give it to brother Dale right am I telling the truth but he would tell us he'd say your daddy would tell me some things and he said I get I'd get some mad contrary to what he'd ever seen and contrary to what he was doing and Daddy was kind of you know smacking on the head he said I'd go over there and he said there's a pillar and and if you've ever been over there and somebody probably haven't but it's sectioned off there's there's concrete pillars that have like P1 well it would be P would run all the way down this way and you would understand where you're going P1 P2 P3 well P1 or whatever it was was Tom's favorite one and it was like concave he said I beat my head against that thing so much because he was dying out to itself because self wanted to take over his self didn't want to die but he did finally and he sat there he said he's a bang that head against that pillar is that what we need to do it got him somewhere it got him something but if God's going to stand for Israel listen he's got to stand for me and you first all right he's got to we have had many battles spiritual battles many great v-days or Victory days that the church has had I mean the church the body of Christ I'm not talking about the organized system but I'm talking about the body of Christ the body of Believers down Through the Ages has had many great Victory days but now remember they're all in the grave waiting on me and you to have a wonderful great Victory Day the last battle our battle of Armageddon we talk about it we've had several Wars wars and rumors of wars and V days and V days and B days and it'll finally wind up in that great battle of Armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle of Armageddon that'll settle the whole thing listen that's what's going to bring the headstone here it's when that battle of armageddon's over and the enemy has been destroyed look Armageddon is to clean off your Earth as it cleans off the Natural Earth he's going to clean off your Earth for seal she re-purified re-purifies herself with atomic blowing listen it's not just going to take a firecracker to get us out of here it's going to take the atomic bomb brother around said What Faith to get us out of here and the volcanic ash and things sink and soap blood of men that's ugly it's a battle we talk about battles I was reading a a small little snippet about a guy that survived D-Day now and those of you that don't know what D-Day is look it up I mean as soon as the men there was like several I I'm trying to say but like 30 000 men came off those boats and the Germans just slaughtered them before they even got to the to the cliff they were just picking him off and he said he said I could hear bullets flying by me he said he said they'd hit the hit my comrades he said the whole Beach was just soaked in red blood so it's a battle it's a battle it's ugly War as hell on Earth but we have a promise that look and the great millennium she sings beneath the Earth the volcanic Brays out again it renews and cleans the Earth for this great millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here I like that yes sir there's coming a Time when it'll be great we talk about being born again being born again just put it plain it's your adoption because your adoption's not your birth all this we've been talking about is not the adoption part of what we're going to talk to about Sunday and we'll not stop right here want to go to the metamorphosis real quick and then we'll come back to this on Sunday everybody all right let's read this right here because there's a lot of different things now you say different yes there is different things that from your new birth to to your adoption there's a lot that goes with that all right you receive the spirit of adoption No Doubt that's how far behind I am so brother Brown tells us let's read this right here Paul tells us in Hebrews 5 10 Bob's been through this before talking about called of God and high priests after the order of Melchizedek I'm whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your dull of hearing boy that's kind of hard for somebody to take for when that for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God he's admonishing the people that they are not where they think they are and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses melt look is unskillful this is not unskillful this is using as they say in the business World your skill set whatever your skill set is you use it every day I know how to do Mail Packages all the blah blah blah I couldn't go do Bob's job I couldn't get in the building they say Lord hillbilly how'd he get in this thing I said I know Bob and throw me and Bob both out because my skill set is not that I might tell them I'm delivering the mail for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe now remember he didn't say he's lost didn't say he was just gone and you know let's just kick that person out no he's a baby and the body he's a son and daughter of God a baby but strong meat belongs to them that are what are a full age even those who by reason of use by reason of you using do you know what exercise I know y'all hate it but your body is made to exercise your body is not made to sit around drink diet I'm not even Diet Coke drink Coke and eat tear chips those you don't know what tether chips are they're potato chips that's how you get 250 pounds but strong meat belongs to them that are a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses hmm memory reason conscious affection imagination remember there's only one sense in the in the middle guy Faith or doubt you're either born again or not George's not talking about it says census you're out in the second room you're out in the spirit realm your senses exercised to discern the good from the evil can you do that you better be able to this is the time this is the time of the separating time because remember the battle of Armageddon oh let me go back to that listen battle of Armageddon is not against two people that like each other there's never been a battle against two people that loved each other not a war like that no that wanted to kill you for a belief and you're wanting to kill them for a belief and keep from getting killed all right Church age during the church ages the bride tree was eat to a stump we know brother Brown tells us that but watch what these four stages of rebirth being born again so let's go through it this is where the butterfly this is where the metamorphosis comes in and man you're talking about keep reading just keep reading about this so there's four stages so the four stages of your to get you to adoption get by with me to get you to adoption it takes four stages not three all right takes four because there's four bugs eat it down Palm one canker worm caterpillar Locus that eat and brother Brown tells us every one of them is Joy the fellowship the word the this the lat all that we're not going to get to it let's just get to what this butterfly is now remember there's four stages of rebirth there is an egg laid by the one that you're going to look like it's laid by the adult in other words you're not gonna get born again under baby teaching hmm but what is justification chopped off what you were before come on and those he's Justified he's already glorified so if you're a real true egg now listen if you're a real true egg you'll become a butterfly all right caterpillar is the next stage it's the feeding stage this thing to burst out turns into a caterpillar and what do you do when you become sanctified you come to church you start eating the word of God you start kicking out all the bad stuff everybody with me caterpillar is the feeding stage it's the stage that tells it it tells in the uh um encyclopedia or whatever you know Google that a caterpillar will eat five times its weight but there's a butterfly inside there and that butterfly is longing to get out so the more he eats the bigger he gets and it might not look so pretty sanctification is not really pretty because it's a tearing it's a ripping it's a pull and remember it's blood sanctification is the blood all right so the pupa stage is the transition stage or the New Birth your cells grow rapidly then you've got a new life there's something inside of you wanting to get out it's a transition stage that's you still kind of look a little like the caterpillar but you don't look like a butterfly but you look more like toward the butterfly than you do the caterpillar you look more like God that's a new birth than you did at sanctification all right now when you come to the adult it's the reproductive stage about how to fit you mature by the word what are you doing you're coming back to what that was that planted you born in His image not we're not looking like it you may not look like it till you get to the very end stage but you still have four stages full restoration what did it do it brought you back to what puts you in the ground or what planted the egg the stage where you look like your birth parents praise God each stage is different and serves a purpose at each stage that's why we believe in true justification chopped off your past sins true sanctification unclean Spirit goes out you start living better living right that's not your new birth right the pupil stage is a transition stage cells start growing you actually start changing into another image praise the Lord you start changing into another image because you're getting ready to look like a butterfly and then when you get to the maturity of the adoption stage you're looking like the father and the mother that brought you here so each stage is different it serves the purpose of each stage each one of these are a stage that we come to are a metamorphosis it's the process of transformation from an immature form to an adult form and two or more distinct stages well it's four we know that there's different ones for different bugs a change of the form or nature of a thing or person into a completely different one by natural or Supernatural means the Journey Begins With a call to Adventure away from the Ordinary World one is familiar with and comfortable in you know there's many times there's many bugs I was reading on that a little bit I'll try to want to stay with the butterfly but there are different ones that they lay an egg and it's not until another year before that thing starts growing or getting to a caterpillar there's different ones but you and I we come to this stage to wear an egg then we come to Caterpillar then we come to the pupa and then we come to the adult stage just like this right here initially one may deny this call because of its Dawning pull toward a potential dangerous unknown a caterpillar when he's eaten listen when the caterpillar is eating he's not going I'm gonna be a butterfly I'm gonna be a bird no the butterflies inside there he's eating because he's jumped down his side he said just keep eating you may not look like it but just keep on eating there's something inside there I want to get out but you gotta eat for it to get out if answered and acted upon one enters in a special world where one undergoes a series of tests and challenges the road of Trials encounters enemies and also mentors and allies that guide and assist through the difficulties through the fires of tribulation and Chaos a part of the initiate dies and it's reborn wow because remember the caterpillar all that breaks apart all that breaks away I think the the article I was reading uh caterpillar actually this that's why they grow so big they grow so big they crack if you don't eat enough you don't crack so they die and there's a butterfly inside there nothing comes out but if you eat enough and swell up enough you'll crack and what comes out what's inside of you to the fires of tribulation and Chaos are part of the initiate dies and is reborn resurrected within a lecture that is taken back to be shared with the Ordinary World what we watch butterflies right they're just beautiful we plant butterfly plants butterfly bushes sorry butterfly bushes we do or we did you got butterfly bushes why to see the caterpillar see the egg to see that ugly Pupa hanging down on kiss right here underneath the leaf no but if you don't see those you'll never see the butterfly so we plant butterfly bushes to see the butterfly not see the caterpillar not see all these other stages we discover there's more to give and have the capacity now to bestow these inner qualities unto others this edification of self deepens us into a more Mythic way of being in the world a higher plane of existing there's your adoption because nobody not everybody's going to come to adoption a higher point of existing unless musicians come let's stand our feet then where then when we started from from which we can give more of ourself listen the egg sticks to a leaf it don't move okay everybody with me the caterpillar only can crawl so far when that Pupa comes it stops it starts working on the inside but what moves what gives more of our self is when we reproduce what was planted inside of us same way with corn same way with anything and this is what we're coming to and we'll get to it maybe Sunday Matthew 21 Jesus said unto them do you did you never read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits there of another he's telling Israel that he's coming out from you and going to be given to a gentile Nation and that's us and whosoever shall fall on
