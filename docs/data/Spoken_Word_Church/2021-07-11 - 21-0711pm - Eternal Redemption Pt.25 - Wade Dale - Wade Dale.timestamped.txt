[0:04] Okay. Um, so, uh, I wanted to thank
[0:07] Nanny and Poppy for letting me go to
[0:09] BYC. It was my first year and I had like
[0:11] a really good time. Um, and, um, yeah, I
[0:16] really liked it. Um, I think I really
[0:19] got something out of the messages and I
[0:21] really feel like there's been like a big
[0:22] change in me. Um, so I really want to
[0:27] make this quick cuz I know we don't have
[0:28] a lot of time. So, I was basically
[0:30] delivered from um a suicidal spirit um a
[0:34] spirit of depression and uh um I was
[0:37] prayed for um by brother Andrew and a
[0:40] few of my friends. And um it was it's
[0:43] gone now and I haven't been dealing with
[0:45] anything. And um it it was actually very
[0:49] funny cuz I wasn't planning on being
[0:50] prayed for. I was stuck in the mentality
[0:52] that I wouldn't be healed because it had
[0:55] been going on for such a long time. And
[0:57] so, but um when I was prayed for it was
[1:00] just completely gone after that and I
[1:03] haven't been dealing with anything. So,
[1:07] [Applause]
[1:18] Well, the devil kept telling me not to
[1:20] tell a testimony, so I'm here telling a
[1:22] testimony.
[1:25] Basically, um, these past few weeks,
[1:27] especially after I had gotten saved, he
[1:29] had started reminding me of things I had
[1:32] done for my past. And I knew God had
[1:34] forgiven me and stuff. And I was like, I
[1:37] know I shouldn't be worried about it. I
[1:38] repented. God forgave me of my sins and
[1:40] all that, but he I it was still in my
[1:43] mind and it was kind of stressing me
[1:44] out. So, I was battling with all that
[1:47] baggage for my past and um still felt
[1:50] emotional and a little scarred from
[1:52] things I had been through, even a couple
[1:54] grudges that I needed to let go of, just
[1:56] things I needed to just let go of
[1:57] completely. And um
[1:58] so I went up to the altar at BYC
[2:01] and a sister came up. It was actually my
[2:03] counselor. She was like, "I think God
[2:05] wants you to let go of some baggage from
[2:07] your past. You can't hide from God. He
[2:09] loves you and he forgives you and wants
[2:11] you to continue moving forward in his
[2:13] word. He's forming you into a mighty
[2:15] woman of God. And I just I lost it. I
[2:18] started crying, praising God. I felt a
[2:20] huge burden lift off of my shoulders and
[2:22] it
[2:23] I was so happy to have been delivered of
[2:25] that. But um I really want to thank
[2:28] brother and sister Dell for paying for
[2:30] us to giving this uh the opportunity to
[2:33] go to this camp. It was a real blessing
[2:36] and we had lots of fun and really
[2:37] enjoyed it.
[2:38] Thank you.
[2:48] So, I want to thank brother and sister
[2:49] Dale for letting me go to this camp cuz
[2:52] without them um paying for it, I may not
[2:54] have gotten the blessing that I got.
[2:56] Yeah.
[2:57] So, I was I'm sorry. I promise I
[3:00] wouldn't cry.
[3:04] It's all right.
[3:07] So, I was dealing with a lot of
[3:08] depression.
[3:12] And Satan was like telling me that I
[3:15] couldn't get away from it. And I
[3:17] believed it. So, I couldn't get away
[3:19] from it. And I kept going to the altar
[3:22] and I was trying to get rid of it. And I
[3:24] would pray and I wouldn't get anything.
[3:28] And Zane would tell me, "See, you're not
[3:29] going to get delivered from that
[3:31] depression. like you're never going to
[3:33] get rid of it. You're just stuck with it
[3:34] for the rest of your life.
[3:36] So
[3:38] on Wednesday night, I went up to go get
[3:40] prayed for. And brother Andrew Glover
[3:43] told me
[3:45] about how God could free me from that.
[3:47] And if I only just believed that I could
[3:50] be freed from that depression, then I
[3:51] wouldn't have to be stuck with it the
[3:54] rest of my life.
[3:55] And so he started praying for me and I
[3:58] believed. And the next day,
[4:01] um, I felt like I really felt a burden
[4:03] lift off my shoulder and I knew that I
[4:05] was delivered. And of course,
[4:08] of course, Satan came back to me and he
[4:10] told me that I wasn't delivered from it.
[4:12] And he tried to still tell me that I
[4:14] still had depression.
[4:16] But I kept believing and I went back to
[4:19] church. And ever since that day that I
[4:21] got prayed for and I believed, I haven't
[4:24] had depression ever since.
[4:26] [Applause]
[4:34] Amen. Praise God. We're going to kick
[4:35] that spirit of depression out of here.
[4:38] Praise the Lord. And the only one that
[4:40] can do it is God.
[4:42] When you yield to him, he's more than to
[4:44] do anything. So, we just thank God for
[4:47] these young people. Thank God that God's
[4:49] delivered them for some of these things.
[4:50] Now, it's Satan's going to battle them.
[4:54] You know, they're going to make them
[4:55] lingo. what you got up there wasn't
[4:57] wasn't it's just temporary. No, when God
[5:00] does a work, it's eternal.
[5:03] So, you believe that? Amen. Brother
[5:04] Ryan, we know that he was battling at
[5:06] one point in time with depression. So,
[5:08] he knows how it is. Thank Gabby as well.
[5:11] So,
[5:12] some of us here have. So, we say boo
[5:15] devil.
[5:15] Amen to that the spirit. Amen. Praise
[5:18] God. We're going to have um let's just
[5:21] sing this little song and uh uh we're
[5:23] going to get the group ready. the uh the
[5:25] young people, they're going to sing a

[19:15] [Music]
[19:19] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[19:24] Open the eyes of my heart.
[19:28] I want to see you.
[19:33] Oh, I want to see you.
[19:40] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[19:45] Oh, open the eyes of my arm.
[19:50] I want to see you.
[19:55] I want to see you
[20:00] to see
[20:02] high and lifted up.
[20:07] Shining in the light of your glory.
[20:13] Pour out your power and love as we sing.
[20:18] Holy, holy, holy. Love him today.
[20:24] High and lifted up,
[20:29] shining in the light of glory.
[20:34] Pour out your power and love as we sing.
[20:39] Holy, holy, holy,
[20:44] [Music]
[20:47] holy, holy, holy.
[20:51] You are holy, holy, holy.
[20:57] Yes, Lord. Holy, holy, holy.
[21:02] I want to see you.
[21:07] I forgot to mention this that that the
[21:10] new uh song special sheets, they're
[21:12] downstairs. Uh there's one also in the
[21:15] recording room. So, just look through it
[21:17] and see if you have to sing a song
[21:19] special just how we've been doing.
[21:20] They're they're up for this month and
[21:22] for August, right? I forgot to mention.
[21:24] Thank you, brother Louise, for doing
[21:26] that. If you don't know where that's at,
[21:28] there's one on the refrigerator
[21:30] downstairs will tell you when you're
[21:32] supposed to sing. So, uh, and if you
[21:34] cannot sing,
[21:37] you need to let one of the song leaders
[21:38] know. Actually, Brother Louise is
[21:40] probably the one you need to let know
[21:42] if, uh, if you can't, uh, if you can't
[21:44] be here, like today, Sister Aster
[21:46] Smallwood was not here and it was her
[21:48] time to sing. So, uh, thank you, Sister
[21:52] Christine. I want to thank Sister
[21:53] Christine and Sister Trudy Colin,
[21:58] for taking time with the youth and
[22:00] putting in some good harmony, not just
[22:01] coming up here and and practicing a
[22:04] song, but trying to get the parts
[22:05] together and the pieces together and and
[22:07] spending a lot of time doing that to uh
[22:10] to help our youth sing to the glory of
[22:13] the Lord. You I like special singing.
[22:14] Regular singing is okay, but special
[22:16] singing to me is from I mean it's all
[22:18] from the heart, but it comes from one
[22:19] person and you can get to feel what
[22:22] they're going through. And the song
[22:23] usually you'll sing a song of something
[22:25] you're going through or a song of
[22:27] something God's laid on your heart.
[22:28] Well, if God laid it on your heart,
[22:30] you're the conduit he's going to use to
[22:31] get it to the people
[22:33] at that moment. That's your ministry is
[22:35] to be able to sing that special the way
[22:37] that you do sing it. So, I thank Sister
[22:39] Christine and Sister Truth. They've done
[22:41] it for a while, but they really stepped
[22:42] up. We had a good time at the 50th
[22:44] anniversary. Um, and also I want you to
[22:47] remember one thing. The devil's real.
[22:51] When you stand up and make a statement
[22:53] that we've only had two pastors
[22:56] in the whole 50 years, well, see what he
[22:58] done? He tried to knock us off our
[23:01] testimony, but we still have a
[23:02] testimony.
[23:04] This church,
[23:07] for those of you that weren't here,
[23:08] we've we've been in one building for 50
[23:10] years. We've never made a payment on
[23:12] this building and we've only had two
[23:15] pastors
[23:16] in 50 years. They ain't many message
[23:17] churches can say that. So, just feel
[23:20] happy and joyous and there's been no
[23:22] splits. We've had people leave. We've
[23:25] actually uh had people go off and and do
[23:29] other churches under our blessing. But,
[23:32] um and that goes to show you that the
[23:34] devil's going to try his best
[23:37] to knock you off your testimony. Okay.
[23:41] He ain't going to knock you off
[23:42] testimony.
[23:43] Do you know William Marryiam Brandon,
[23:44] the prophet of the end time, suffered
[23:46] depression,
[23:47] right?
[23:48] He said he did. I was looking up quotes
[23:49] when you were talking about that two
[23:51] times. He said, "I suffered the same
[23:53] thing, sister."
[23:54] Depression. A prophet
[23:57] probably more than you'll ever know.
[23:59] Amen. Because he was in between two
[24:01] worlds.
[24:02] And depression is really just it's
[24:03] nervousness. It's nervousness and
[24:06] thinking that everybody's against you.
[24:07] And nobody's against you, girl. We all
[24:10] for you. Amen. We all for you. Don't you
[24:13] worry about that. There's one thing
[24:15] though. When the devil's mouth's moving,
[24:17] he's lying.
[24:18] Amen. And like I said before,
[24:21] all of you today in this building should
[24:24] feel comfortable except for one person.
[24:28] I want the devil to feel so
[24:29] uncomfortable
[24:30] in this building till he leaves.
[24:32] Amen. We going to have a church service
[24:34] anyway. whether he hangs around or not,
[24:37] he can just listen to all this good
[24:38] singing and good preaching that we're
[24:40] going to do. So, God bless you.
[24:42] Brother Luis will be bringing the
[24:43] message for us Wednesday night.
[24:46] Also, remember and be praying for our
[24:47] youth service will be July the 24th.
[24:50] That will be on a Saturday and we'll
[24:52] also be Sunday. Uh we need to we need
[24:55] some workers to get together next
[24:57] Sunday. We'll discuss it. Uh what we're
[24:59] going to do is start at 3:00. We'll have
[25:01] a meal for the young people. And brother
[25:02] Richard Hayyatt, as far as I know, he's
[25:05] going to be here from Kentucky the whole
[25:07] weekend. And he's that brother I go
[25:08] preach for when I go to Illinois
[25:10] hunting. And he's a really good solid
[25:12] brother. So, um, he'll be here for the
[25:14] weekend. Also, remember there's camp
[25:17] meeting coming up in August, Brother Joe
[25:20] Green's camp meeting. There will be no
[25:21] foreign brothers there, but we still
[25:23] they'll still have the meeting at the
[25:24] church. Brother Donnie Reagan and
[25:26] Brother Ron Spencer will be doing the
[25:28] Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
[25:30] services. So, let's go support them if
[25:32] we can. Also, I got a call yesterday
[25:34] from Brother Brad Powell. They will be
[25:37] having their youth camp uh Labor Day
[25:40] weekend. That will be September
[25:42] somewhere in the 3, four, five,
[25:44] somewhere in there. So, just keep that
[25:45] in your heart and your mind. That would
[25:47] be in September. Also remember we will
[25:51] be having a youth meeting on
[25:54] September the 25th and 26th. Brother
[25:56] Andrew Glover will be with us. So that
[25:58] will be our youth meeting on Saturday.
[26:00] Brother Andrew will be here Saturday and
[26:03] Sunday. So just keep that in your
[26:05] prayers. That's what's coming up. And
[26:07] also Sister Esther Smallwood called and
[26:11] said her nose is not broke.
[26:13] So thank God for that. It's just it's
[26:16] just a bad sprain. I'm not going to
[26:18] figure out or wonder what happened and
[26:20] how she got that. It really doesn't
[26:21] matter. She's healed.
[26:23] Amen. That'll be all right.
[26:26] We are uh
[26:28] we serve a living God.
[26:30] He takes care of us even when we don't
[26:31] take care of oursel.
[26:33] Amen. He's right there. Everpresent help
[26:35] in a time of trouble. So, let's go to
[26:37] the word of God in Hebrews 9:11.
[26:41] And just remember, continue to remember
[26:43] brother Dale on your prayers. I got my
[26:44] phone up here too, so I'm sorry, but if
[26:47] something comes up, we'll we'll let you
[26:48] know. Anna's got her phone open, too.
[26:51] Sister Lisa, also they are still
[26:53] checking him out for other things. But
[26:54] you know what?
[26:57] Everything will be all right.
[26:59] Amen.
[27:00] You just pray for us. All of us need to
[27:02] just bind together closer,
[27:04] not scatter,
[27:06] you know, just bind together closer and
[27:08] uh and we'll be fine. uh this morning
[27:11] was uh it was a testimony that the man
[27:14] even though he wasn't feeling good he
[27:16] got
[27:17] to the place that he was supposed to be.
[27:18] He stood behind this pull pit
[27:23] right here. He stood right here sir.
[27:25] Now whatever was happened that's okay
[27:27] but he stood in his post of duty. He
[27:28] didn't stay home. He didn't shun his
[27:30] post of duty. So we thank God for that.
[27:32] So let's go to Hebrews 9:11.
[27:34] We're still on the eternal plan of
[27:36] redemption. This is part number 25
[27:39] and we'll continue on and we we um we'll
[27:42] be talking about the redemption of
[27:45] Israel. All right, because they are part
[27:47] of the plan of redemption.
[27:49] Hebrews 9:11. Let's go to there. All
[27:51] right, let's bow our heads. Dear
[27:53] heavenly father, thank you this day that
[27:55] you've given us Lord time to look into
[27:58] your word of God and Lord to be able to
[28:01] assemble a group of people together to
[28:03] hear the word of God. And Father, now as
[28:05] we are assembled here, Lord, we pray
[28:07] that you would sanctify us, Lord. Move
[28:09] us out of the way. You take over. You do
[28:11] the speaking. You do the revealing.
[28:13] Father, because without you, this is
[28:15] truly just a meeting of minds. Lord, I
[28:17] pray that you'd be with Brother Dale.
[28:19] Touch him, Lord, in in the hospital
[28:21] there as they're doing what man can do.
[28:25] But we know that you're God
[28:28] and you change not. And he stood for you
[28:30] all those years. Now I pray that you're
[28:31] up there right there standing with him
[28:33] there in the emergency room with your
[28:36] servant. We pray Lord that you just
[28:38] strengthen each one of us. Keep us all
[28:39] strong and healthy and safe. Forgive us
[28:42] of our many sins and Lord all the
[28:43] different things that we have Lord
[28:45] problems of life and sometimes we take
[28:48] them for granted. But Lord we know that
[28:49] you're there with us. You said you'd
[28:51] never leave us or forsake us. So give us
[28:53] Lord today our daily bread. Thank you
[28:55] for the visitors that are here Lord and
[28:56] they may be having to return back home
[28:58] sometime soon. Lord, we pray that you'd
[29:00] just get them back home safe. Father,
[29:02] just give us, Lord, strength for the
[29:04] journey. In Jesus name we ask.
[29:07] Amen. Hebrews 9:11. Jim keeps remember
[29:10] me remembering reminding me that's 911.
[29:13] So I don't know if that's some kind of
[29:14] be alert. It's 911.
[29:17] Yeah, it's going to be a bomb. I better
[29:20] not be bombing. It's not bomb. But she
[29:23] does that when she sits up here. when
[29:24] she sits back under she say anything but
[29:27] Christ be being coming high priest of
[29:29] good things to come by greater and more
[29:30] perfect tabernacle not made with hands
[29:33] that is to say not of this building
[29:35] neither by the blood of goats and calavs
[29:37] but by his own blood he entered in once
[29:39] into the holy place and here's my been
[29:41] my whole thought for 25 services having
[29:44] obtained eternal redemption
[29:47] for us
[29:49] eternal redemption
[29:50] for us now let's go to Amos 3 and7 Seven
[29:54] Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he
[29:56] revealth
[29:58] his secrets and to his servants the
[30:01] prophets. The lion hath roared who will
[30:03] not fear. The Lord God hath spoken. Who
[30:07] can but prophesy? Ain't that what we're
[30:09] supposed to do? According to Revelations
[30:10] 10
[30:11] 8,
[30:13] we're supposed to prophesy. Revelation.
[30:15] Now, let's read Revelations 10:7. But in
[30:18] the days of the voice of the seventh
[30:19] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[30:21] mystery, one mystery of God should be
[30:23] finished, as he hath declared to his
[30:25] servants the prophets. You may be
[30:27] seated. We're going to read this. 1
[30:29] Thessalonians 4
[30:32] 13.
[30:33] But I would not have you ignorant,
[30:35] brethren, concerning them which are
[30:36] asleep, that you sorrow not even as
[30:38] others which have no hope. Boy, that's
[30:40] pitiful that you don't have any hope.
[30:42] For if we believe that Jesus died and
[30:44] rose again, even so them which sleep in
[30:46] Jesus will God bring with him.
[30:49] Now, this is what we're going to try to
[30:50] cover. We got to cover this and then go
[30:52] on to the two witnesses. For this we say
[30:54] unto you by the word of the Lord, that
[30:56] we which are alive and remain,
[30:59] that's me and you.
[31:00] Amen.
[31:01] We which are alive and remain until the
[31:03] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[31:05] them which are asleep. Amen.
[31:07] No one on this earth is going to prevent
[31:10] the bride coming out of the ground
[31:12] except us getting in position.
[31:15] Amen. This eternal redemption right now
[31:17] is hinging on us getting out of the way
[31:19] and it going on to Israel.
[31:21] Everybody got that? Say amen.
[31:24] For the Lord himself,
[31:26] he's not trusting it to a second person
[31:28] or a third person. For the Lord himself
[31:30] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[31:32] the voice of an archangel and the trump
[31:34] of God. You know, if you talk to people
[31:36] in the world, they're looking for a and
[31:39] a hurry and a
[31:41] right.
[31:42] That's what they're looking for.
[31:44] Yeah.
[31:45] It's already happened,
[31:47] and you and I are the recipients of it.
[31:50] Amen.
[31:50] You and I are sitting here today.
[31:52] Fulfill that scripture right there.
[31:54] To the point.
[31:55] Amen.
[31:56] And the trump of God. And look at that.
[31:59] It says, "Pause. Pause right here.
[32:01] Pause." because we hadn't got to this
[32:03] part yet,
[32:04] right?
[32:05] Because the dead in Christ shall rise
[32:07] first
[32:08] and we what then we we which are alive
[32:12] and remain shall be caught up together
[32:14] with them in the cloud to meet the Lord
[32:16] in the air. And so shall we ever be with
[32:19] the Lord. All right. So let's pull up
[32:21] the chart just for a second for some of
[32:23] the visitors that's been here. Y'all
[32:25] should have yours somewhere in your seat
[32:26] or we're going to show it right here.
[32:28] the chart of we we we're tracking from
[32:30] Adam to the future home. Everybody got
[32:33] that? Say amen.
[32:34] All right. So, for the ones that have
[32:36] not been here, we kind of have already
[32:38] flowed through all this chart. And I'm
[32:39] not going to background because we don't
[32:40] have time for we are right here. We're
[32:43] past the day of Pentecost. We're getting
[32:44] to a place where Jesus Well, let's go
[32:47] right here to where Jesus, he came to
[32:49] his own and his own received him not
[32:51] because he had to put the Old Testament
[32:55] church away because of their whoring
[32:58] that they went to just plain. He had to
[33:00] put them away because they were
[33:01] prostituting him. They were they were
[33:03] following other gods. They were doing
[33:05] things that they weren't supposed to do.
[33:06] So God put them away when he came to the
[33:10] earth. The Bible said he came to his own
[33:12] and his own received him not. But as
[33:14] many as received him, to them gave he
[33:17] power to become the sons of God. So it
[33:20] was to the Gentiles and to the Jews. But
[33:22] he came to the Jews first and the Jews
[33:25] rejected him. And we know that's in John
[33:27] 1:11. You don't just keep the chart.
[33:29] Then let me read this. Romans 11:25. For
[33:31] I would not, brethren, that you should
[33:33] be ignorant of this mystery, lest you
[33:35] should be wise in your own conceit. That
[33:37] blindness in part has happened to
[33:39] Israel.
[33:41] God blinded his own children.
[33:43] That's right.
[33:45] Until the fullness of the Gentiles
[33:48] become in. Now, where's this gentile
[33:51] church begin? On the day of Pentecost,
[33:53] Acts 2 verse1,
[33:55] Christ came back as the Holy Ghost of
[33:57] the new birth onto 120 people. The
[34:00] promise that he gave them. It did not go
[34:02] to the Jews because listen, we'll pull
[34:04] up the chart in a minute. We look at
[34:06] Daniel 70 weeks in Daniel 9:24.
[34:10] It's not just something that we debate
[34:12] about in the message.
[34:14] It's a happening.
[34:15] It's it's the redemption of Israel.
[34:18] They get a six-fold purpose. We get six
[34:20] seals. No, brother Wade. We get seven.
[34:22] We get six seals. There's only six seals
[34:24] in the Bible.
[34:25] Right.
[34:27] Cuz the seventh seal silent.
[34:29] That's right.
[34:30] And there stands the seventh seal right
[34:32] there. Remember Jesus preached six seals
[34:35] in Matthew
[34:37] 24,
[34:38] right?
[34:39] Because he was number seven,
[34:42] and the prophet of God tells us six
[34:44] seals finishes redemption. So the
[34:46] six-fold purpose in Daniel 9:24, we'll
[34:49] read it a little bit later on. That
[34:50] six-fold purpose, whatever puts us
[34:53] in the future home or puts us in the
[34:56] millennium is going to put Israel in the
[34:58] millennium.
[35:00] But ours is a new birth and going
[35:03] through the three stages of grace and
[35:05] going coming up to the statue of perfect
[35:07] man and then taking a body change and
[35:09] then taking a rapture. Listen folks,
[35:11] we're not looking for a rapture.
[35:16] Boy, some that don't come here look at
[35:17] you kind of crosseyed.
[35:22] Why? It's not even in the Bible.
[35:24] Right.
[35:25] Yes.
[35:26] There's a catching away.
[35:29] We're going to read it in a minute. In
[35:30] Revelations 4, it says, "Caught up."
[35:34] I thought I just read to you that the
[35:35] dead in Christ shall rise first.
[35:38] So, we're looking for a resurrection
[35:40] message.
[35:41] We're looking for a resurrection message
[35:43] coming from me and you to call the dead
[35:45] saints out of the ground. Then, the
[35:47] Bible says we will be changed. Then, the
[35:49] Bible says we'll be caught up to meet
[35:51] the Lord in the air. So, let's just quit
[35:53] skipping all the way to the rapture.
[35:54] It's not going to take place till the
[35:55] dead come out of the ground. Right?
[35:57] And where's it going to come from? No,
[36:00] it's going to come from you and me. It's
[36:01] cuz the voice of the resurrection is
[36:03] inside of us.
[36:04] Amen.
[36:06] That's where everybody's confused. You
[36:07] see how the devil delays things? Even in
[36:10] the denominational world, they he delays
[36:11] things. Well, that's okay. Now, that's
[36:14] all right. And if you're if you're a
[36:15] denominational person, they don't care
[36:17] anything about church ages, but they
[36:18] know that they're going to have to go
[36:19] through seven years of tribulation and
[36:22] then they then they going to get saved.
[36:28] That's what they say. So what? So now I
[36:31] can just keep waiting and keep waiting
[36:33] and keep waiting. No. One day that still
[36:35] small voice is going to say, "You missed
[36:37] it."
[36:39] Because the c this catching away that
[36:41] we're going to come to is secret,
[36:44] right?
[36:45] But it's got to come from the voice of
[36:47] the resurrection inside of me and you.
[36:48] Amen.
[36:49] The opening of those seals that that
[36:51] seventh seal will produce itself, stand
[36:53] on the earth
[36:54] in a bride, a headstone,
[36:56] and call the saints out of the ground.
[36:58] Because listen,
[37:00] listen, that's why it's important that
[37:02] the son of man ministry has to come back
[37:04] in the end time.
[37:06] The son of man is what's been through
[37:07] all that.
[37:08] He said, "I am the resurrection and the
[37:10] life." Now, where were we at that time?
[37:12] We were inside of that son of man.
[37:13] Right.
[37:15] Right.
[37:17] See, it's not We We try to separate this
[37:20] thing. We try to, like I said before, we
[37:22] we we beat the oneness to death and we
[37:24] beat the Trinitarians to death and we're
[37:25] the biggest tunist you ever seen in your
[37:27] life.
[37:27] Yeah.
[37:28] Well, there's Jesus and here's us. I
[37:30] ain't nothing and you ain't nothing.
[37:33] Well, I'm going to read I read y'all the
[37:34] other day in in Matthew I mean Yeah. No,
[37:37] John chapter 17.
[37:40] There's the Lord's prayer
[37:42] that they may be one
[37:45] as you and I are one. Well, how was the
[37:47] father and him one?
[37:50] No, they weren't two.
[37:52] They were one.
[37:53] So, you and I, that's the great
[37:54] revelation of the seventh seal is that
[37:56] you and Christ are
[37:58] one.
[37:59] Amen. And we're going to produce that. I
[38:01] promise you, we are going to produce
[38:03] that because we have to. There's nobody
[38:04] else to produce it.
[38:06] No one else. Church ages are over,
[38:09] folks. Church ages. We're done with
[38:11] We're done with the church ages,
[38:12] right?
[38:14] But we had to have a gentile bride
[38:17] because God had to put away Israel from
[38:20] all this back here.
[38:24] But Jesus came to his own. His own
[38:25] received him not. He walked in this
[38:27] world. He preached three and a half
[38:28] years. He died. He went to hell. He came
[38:30] back. He resurrected as the son of man.
[38:34] Right? That flesh body man actually came
[38:38] out of the ground
[38:39] with a glorified body.
[38:43] Amen.
[38:46] Malachi's running the He's running the U
[38:49] cameras.
[38:51] I told him he's not to keep up with me.
[38:59] But that's what it's going to be, folks.
[39:01] We've had down through the church ages,
[39:03] we've had a hope as brother um
[39:07] was talking about. There's everybody's
[39:09] had a hope.
[39:10] I hope I'm saved. I hope I'm going to
[39:13] make it.
[39:13] Hope I'm going to walk on the streets
[39:15] and go. I hope somewhere in this
[39:18] tribulation period I'll get saved. I'm
[39:20] talking about the denominational world.
[39:22] That's not true.
[39:24] Right?
[39:25] You get born again now.
[39:27] You don't have to go through the
[39:29] tribulation. You don't have to stand
[39:31] judgment.
[39:32] I told you that's two great revelations
[39:34] that if I never get another revelation,
[39:36] kids, if you never get another
[39:37] revelation,
[39:41] realize one thing's for sure. You do not
[39:44] have to ever stand at the white throne
[39:46] judgment.
[39:48] You will never have to give an account
[39:49] of what you did if you're born again.
[39:53] And you will not have to go through the
[39:55] tribulation period. You are going to be
[39:57] caught up in the air
[39:58] to meet the Lord. to never be with him.
[40:00] And we'll read that in just a little
[40:01] bit.
[40:03] But the bride now is a gentile bride. We
[40:06] have to go through a church age. We have
[40:08] to go through,
[40:11] excuse me, in the days of the voice of
[40:13] the seventh angel.
[40:15] We have to go through those things. You
[40:16] look in Acts 13:46,
[40:20] Paul says, "Lo, we turn to the
[40:21] Gentiles." Don't you don't have just
[40:22] leave that up because I'm just going to
[40:24] read it. We know I've already read these
[40:25] about three times. All right. But now,
[40:27] let's do though. Let's take that down
[40:29] and let's read Revelations 1
[40:32] 13
[40:34] through 20. If that's all right,
[40:35] brothers, if you pull that up.
[40:39] Revelations 11:13 is what? In the midst
[40:41] of the seven candlesticks, what? One
[40:43] likened to the son of who?
[40:45] Son of man.
[40:47] Son of man. God in human flesh.
[40:50] But what is his position at this time?
[40:53] He's g about the paps, the breast with a
[40:56] golden girdle. So, he's in bride form,
[41:00] right?
[41:00] And John sees that and the guy, the
[41:02] man's standing like this. And here he's
[41:04] got the seven candlesticks right down
[41:05] here in front of him. He's got his arms
[41:07] out, but he's got a special something in
[41:09] his right hand.
[41:10] Yeah.
[41:11] He's got seven stars.
[41:14] Seven stars.
[41:15] Not six, not five. Seven stars. Head and
[41:19] hair white like wool, white as snow, and
[41:21] his eyes were as flames of fire. You see
[41:23] that shows also that in bride form he's
[41:26] a judge
[41:27] because the Bible said the saints will
[41:29] judge the earth.
[41:30] You and I will be the judge. There'll
[41:31] not be just one person sitting up there.
[41:33] The whole bride will be sitting up there
[41:36] in judgment judging the world.
[41:40] You will not have to be judged one more
[41:42] time. Your judgment is over
[41:45] if you're born again.
[41:47] And his feet was f like fine brass as a
[41:49] burn in the furnace and voice the sound
[41:51] of many people or waters. He had in his
[41:55] right hand seven stars. And out of his
[41:57] mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. What
[41:58] a word. And his countenance was as a sun
[42:01] shineth in his strength. When I saw him,
[42:03] I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
[42:06] his right hand upon me and said, "Fear
[42:07] not. I am the first and the last. I am
[42:10] he that liveth and was dead." Now only
[42:13] the son of man can say that. Right.
[42:17] That's right.
[42:18] And behold, I am alive forever more.
[42:22] You see, Lazarus and all the different
[42:23] ones that was resurrected from the dead,
[42:25] they had to die again.
[42:28] This man right here, once he said, "I am
[42:31] alive forever more. He's alive for
[42:35] eternity
[42:36] in that glorified body." Everybody got
[42:38] that?
[42:39] And have the keys of hell and of death.
[42:41] He picked up a set of keys while he was
[42:43] gone. Yes. Right.
[42:45] Write the things which thou hast seen
[42:46] and the things which are and the things
[42:48] which shall be hereafter. The mystery of
[42:50] the seven stars which thou sawest in my
[42:52] right hand and the seven golden
[42:54] candlesticks. The seven stars are the
[42:56] angels of the seven churches. And the
[43:00] seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[43:02] the seven churches. Now listen, there
[43:04] were not seven individual churches
[43:07] like this building. Right.
[43:10] It was it was a characteristic of the
[43:12] age
[43:13] and the people fit that characteristic.
[43:14] Right.
[43:16] This is not a Leodysian church. Thank
[43:18] God building.
[43:20] All right. And it was not one over in
[43:21] Leodysa over there in in Asia. It was a
[43:24] church and it was a characteristic. But
[43:26] the the important thing was God sent
[43:29] seven stars. Let's go to the next one.
[43:31] That word means a messenger,
[43:35] an envoy. one who has sent an angel or a
[43:38] messenger straight from God. So, we
[43:40] needed those seven messengers. And like
[43:43] I told y'all before,
[43:45] if brother Random is not our messenger,
[43:54] where's number seven?
[43:56] Cuz he promised me seven church age
[44:00] messengers.
[44:00] That's right. And if we're in the last
[44:02] church age, he's got to put together for
[44:05] me because you know what then, brother
[44:07] David, then if he sends me to hell, I'm
[44:09] going to stand as judgment. I'm going to
[44:10] say, "Look, you didn't do what your word
[44:11] said."
[44:13] Right.
[44:13] You can do that, you know,
[44:15] right?
[44:15] You can do that to God. You can take him
[44:17] to his word. Ain't that what Brother
[44:18] Brown said?
[44:19] Take him to his word. I take him his
[44:21] word. Said, "Look, you didn't send me a
[44:22] messenger. If William Brown's not the
[44:23] person, you got to send me one."
[44:27] But thank God, I'm not searching I'm not
[44:29] searching for another one.
[44:31] I'm not looking for another man. I'm
[44:33] looking for the man.
[44:35] Christ Jesus in a people.
[44:39] Take all your inadequacies and all your
[44:41] dates and all junk. I don't care.
[44:44] William Brandon brought me to Christ.
[44:46] He brought a clarity to the message. He
[44:49] brought me strength, not a hope. He
[44:50] brought me faith.
[44:53] And he was a messenger sent from God.
[44:55] And if he was sent from God, guess what?
[44:56] He's going to do what God sent him to
[44:59] do.
[44:59] That's right. But you know what that
[45:00] does? That also confuses most of the
[45:03] people.
[45:04] Amen.
[45:05] Well, what about this? Well, what about
[45:07] it? They called Jesus the king of the
[45:11] demons
[45:13] when he was here on earth.
[45:14] That's right.
[45:15] They called him Belleub.
[45:18] They called him a wine
[45:19] bber.
[45:21] He hung around with sinners and
[45:22] prostitutes. You try that.
[45:28] See what I mean? That's it,
[45:29] right?
[45:30] And if it's got Listen, folks, and I'm
[45:31] I'm working on something.
[45:35] If we have to see the characteristics of
[45:37] the Son of Man, then we've got to break
[45:38] down what he did while he was on earth.
[45:43] Because if we're looking at the Son of
[45:44] Man, we got to break down what he had
[45:46] what he did while he was on earth.
[45:49] Right.
[45:51] He never screamed at a demon.
[45:54] That's right.
[45:55] He was in full complete control of
[45:57] everything he did from the time he got
[45:59] up in the morning till the time he went
[46:00] to bed at night.
[46:04] He didn't have to scream and holler.
[46:06] That's it.
[46:07] No.
[46:09] Authority came from here.
[46:11] That's right.
[46:12] The demons didn't even want to be around
[46:14] him. They said, "Hey, can we leave?"
[46:16] And he said, "Go."
[46:19] That's what I want us to happen here. I
[46:20] don't We don't have to scream and beat
[46:21] people to get demons out of them. Good
[46:23] grief.
[46:24] See, that's Pentecost. And I'm sorry,
[46:26] but that that's the son of God
[46:28] revelation.
[46:30] Having to lay hands on somebody and
[46:32] having prayer lines, that's okay. But
[46:33] you know what brother Brown said? They
[46:34] didn't have one
[46:36] right
[46:36] in the Bible.
[46:37] Amen.
[46:38] Not one prayer line.
[46:40] So, who created the prayer line? We did.
[46:44] Because of the weakness of the people.
[46:46] If that hurts your feelings, I'm sorry.
[46:48] But because of the weakness of the
[46:50] people, we have prayer lines.
[46:52] Yes.
[46:56] Anyway, that went over like a lead of
[46:59] tub of lead. But that's okay because I'm
[47:02] going to tell you something. You can
[47:03] scream and you can shout and you can
[47:04] shake people all you want to. But until
[47:07] the word's preached to that demon, he'll
[47:10] stay right there.
[47:12] Amen.
[47:12] You preach the true unadulterated word
[47:15] of God, Satan hates the word more than
[47:16] anything. Because listen, brother Ram
[47:18] says, "Satan can pass out supernatural
[47:22] gifts."
[47:23] Swallow that one.
[47:25] Satan can pass out. He listen, he's way
[47:28] more spiritual than you are.
[47:30] The devil is way more spiritual than you
[47:32] are. He was spiritual before the
[47:34] foundation of the world.
[47:35] Right?
[47:37] But listen, what you got inside of you,
[47:39] if you're born again, was before him.
[47:45] That's what I put my faith on. That that
[47:47] was before him.
[47:52] Boo devil.
[47:55] So Malachi 4
[47:58] was sent to do one thing. Behold, I will
[48:01] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[48:02] coming of the great and dreadful death.
[48:04] I know we know this, but this has got to
[48:05] be I got to set this up to talk about
[48:09] the two witnesses going to Israel cuz
[48:11] we're the only thing is hindering them
[48:12] from going,
[48:13] right?
[48:14] You and I. We're hindering them from
[48:16] going. We're hindering the plan of God,
[48:20] but we're not. The plan of God's not
[48:23] behind. It's exactly where it's supposed
[48:25] to be.
[48:26] All right. So, look. Behold, I will send
[48:28] you Elijah the prophet. So, listen,
[48:31] brother David again. He's got to send me
[48:35] Elijah the prophet.
[48:38] Before the great death, dreadful day of
[48:39] the Lord. Now, if William Brandon wasn't
[48:40] it, he better send me one pretty quick.
[48:44] That's right.
[48:45] But I believe he did.
[48:46] Amen.
[48:47] Cuz see, he turned me back. And he shall
[48:50] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[48:51] children. We know that was John the
[48:53] Baptist. He turned the heart of the old
[48:56] testament old test old testament to the
[49:00] new testament children that was born on
[49:03] the day of pentecost. But then he's
[49:06] going to send
[49:08] Elijah number four
[49:12] to turn the Gentiles
[49:15] and forgive me for using this phrase
[49:17] again. He's going to turn the heart of
[49:19] the babbling Pentecostal babies right
[49:23] children.
[49:25] to the faith of the fathers.
[49:30] What's the faith of the fathers? Peter
[49:32] walks up one day and he says, "Hey,
[49:35] silver and gold have I none,
[49:38] but such as I have
[49:40] give I unto thee."
[49:42] Rise up and walk.
[49:45] Now, what about that?
[49:47] If he didn't have it, he couldn't give
[49:49] it.
[49:50] That's right.
[49:51] Right. He had the pure unadulterated
[49:54] word for his time.
[49:57] But God's going to have to send us that
[49:58] Elijah to turn our heart back heart
[50:02] inner part of the children of the
[50:04] fathers. Lest I come and smite the earth
[50:06] with a curse. So we know Malachi 3 was
[50:08] John the Baptist and God didn't smite
[50:10] the earth with a curse. So we know that
[50:12] that was
[50:14] Malachi 4. Let's read Matthew 17:10.
[50:17] We're going to fly through these real
[50:18] quick
[50:20] if that's all right. Everybody okay?
[50:22] We got our mind on what we're doing. All
[50:24] right. Let's put our mind on what we're
[50:26] doing. This is the battle. We need to
[50:27] just keep on fighting.
[50:29] Amen. Keep on fighting.
[50:31] Matthew 17:10. Listen, if we stop every
[50:33] time somebody falls down, you don't ever
[50:35] win the battle.
[50:36] Just keep going.
[50:38] The soldiers will make it back. I
[50:40] promise you.
[50:41] And his disciples asked him, saying,
[50:42] "Why then say the scribes that Elias
[50:44] must first come?" Do you know truly you
[50:47] heard me preach on the five cups of
[50:48] Elijah but they have they know Elijah
[50:51] has to come back because of that
[50:52] previous scripture which is in the Old
[50:54] Testament. The old Orthodox Jews know
[50:57] that Elijah has to come back before the
[51:01] Messiah comes.
[51:02] Right.
[51:04] They just didn't believe it was John the
[51:05] Baptist and they just didn't believe it
[51:06] was William Brandon.
[51:08] Right.
[51:09] Right.
[51:11] So they're looking for Elijah. Every
[51:13] year they have their sedar or whatever
[51:15] the meal that they have. They put a cup
[51:17] out and it's empty. That's called the
[51:18] cup of Elijah. When they're finished
[51:20] eating and Elijah doesn't show up, they
[51:22] walk out the door and they look down the
[51:23] street this way. They look down the
[51:24] street this way. And if they don't see a
[51:26] man and they'll know Elijah when he's
[51:28] coming because he'll know, they'll know
[51:30] him when he gets in those two witnesses.
[51:31] They'll come to the door and they'll
[51:33] look they'll look they'll come back in,
[51:35] take the cup, they put it upon the shelf
[51:36] and say until next year. All right. So
[51:39] they know that Elijah. That's why that
[51:42] when the two witnesses hit Jerusalem,
[51:45] they're going to go, "Finally,
[51:48] Elijah has showed up.
[51:50] Where's the Messiah?" And what they're
[51:52] going to tell him, what they're going to
[51:53] tell them is, "You missed him.
[51:57] You crucified him.
[51:59] Because Jesus answered and said unto
[52:01] them, Elias truly shall come shall first
[52:04] come and restore all things." Because
[52:07] remember now, John the Baptist was not a
[52:08] restorer.
[52:11] That's right.
[52:12] Brother Brandon was like the Elijah
[52:13] number one that when the uh when they
[52:15] went to Mount Carmel and they tore the
[52:17] altar down, what's the first thing
[52:19] Elijah did? He put all the rocks back in
[52:22] the right place.
[52:23] He put all the revelation back in the
[52:26] right place. And then what happened? The
[52:27] fire fell.
[52:28] God consumed that.
[52:33] God consumed that sacrifice when
[52:34] everything was ready.
[52:35] Amen. Amen. Elias truly shall first come
[52:39] and restore all things. So let's go now
[52:42] to Revelations 10. Because listen, if we
[52:45] just take Malachi 4, five, and six,
[52:50] he he came, the prophet of God came and
[52:52] restored us back to the faith of the
[52:54] fathers.
[52:58] And that's okay.
[53:00] But that's under the son of God
[53:01] revelation. That's under the baptism of
[53:04] the Holy Ghost. For you those of you
[53:05] that don't know what I'm talking about,
[53:06] God came back on the day of Pentecost in
[53:08] the form of the baptism of the Holy
[53:10] Ghost came into the believer and gave
[53:13] them power to do great things, signs and
[53:16] wonders and miracles. And the word was
[53:18] preached, but it wasn't preached
[53:19] completely.
[53:21] Paul never mentioned the seal. Peter
[53:24] never mentioned the seals.
[53:26] None of them never mentioned any. John
[53:29] wrote about them,
[53:31] but they were in symbol form. He wrote
[53:33] about them.
[53:34] He didn't preach them. Jesus preached
[53:36] them in Matthew 24.
[53:38] Amen.
[53:40] So now we had to have a prophet come in
[53:43] the end time to do two things. Turn our
[53:46] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[53:48] and
[53:51] and and
[53:53] but in the days of the voice of the
[53:54] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[53:56] sound the mystery one mystery of God.
[54:01] There was one mystery left off is who
[54:03] that son of man was.
[54:05] If you want to put it all in a nutshell,
[54:06] you talk about thunders and boy, people
[54:08] start talking about that and it's all
[54:10] get you all get convoluted in your
[54:12] brain. Forget about it.
[54:14] The seals are for your full total
[54:17] redemption.
[54:19] Body, spirit, and soul. That's what man
[54:21] has not done in during the church ages.
[54:24] He's been born again in his soul, but
[54:26] his body had to go to the grave
[54:29] because there wasn't enough word to or
[54:31] quickened word to change his body. And
[54:34] it wasn't required for those other
[54:36] church ages.
[54:37] It's required in this church age under a
[54:39] seventh messenger, seventh angel sent
[54:43] from God, when he shall begin to sound
[54:46] the mystery of God should be finished as
[54:48] he hath declared to his servants the
[54:51] prophets. Is everybody okay with that?
[54:53] Amen.
[54:53] Let's read this quote right here that we
[54:55] always read.
[54:57] This is brother random in the leadyian
[54:59] church age. Now this messenger of
[55:01] Malachi 4 in Revelations 10:7 remember
[55:03] he bring he has to bring the two
[55:04] scriptures together is going to do two
[55:07] things. One according to Malachi 4 he
[55:09] will turn the hearts of the children
[55:11] Pentecostal babbling babies. Get away
[55:12] from the speaking in tongues is a total
[55:14] evidence. Get away from all these having
[55:17] to lay on of hands. I'm sorry.
[55:19] Right. Listen, the two times the two
[55:24] times in the New Testament that that
[55:27] Jesus came upon a gentile,
[55:31] he never touched them.
[55:36] Even one the centurion said, "I'm of
[55:38] authority. I perceive you're of
[55:40] authority. Whatever I say, they do." You
[55:43] know what he was saying? He was saying,
[55:44] "Man, whatever you got inside of you, if
[55:47] you said the world would turn upside
[55:48] down, all you got to do is say it
[55:51] by his word.
[55:55] If I hurt your feelings, then sorry."
[55:58] But we got to get to where we're mature
[55:59] adults,
[56:01] not babbling babies,
[56:03] where every little thing happens and we
[56:05] just fall apart. You can't do that.
[56:08] Two, he will reveal the mysteries of the
[56:11] seven thunders. Now, like I said, don't
[56:13] get all don't get all googly eyed. Seven
[56:16] thunders are what? Not seven men. It's
[56:19] not seven virtues.
[56:21] It's the seven seals revealed to a
[56:24] individual.
[56:25] Right?
[56:26] Because I just Brother Brandham this
[56:27] morning, did you see on there? He said
[56:29] the greatest thunder is to the devil is
[56:32] a life lived.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:35] Thousands of thundering voices. That's
[56:37] what God's looking for. The greatest
[56:39] thunder Satan will ever get will is
[56:41] because he'll come to you and there'll
[56:43] be nothing he can take a hold of.
[56:45] Right. That's right.
[56:47] That's the greatest thunder you will
[56:48] don't look for a boom boom boom. Don't
[56:49] look for all that other stuff.
[56:51] Right.
[56:52] Okay. Just remember in one time if Satan
[56:56] comes to you
[56:57] say get behind me.
[57:00] That's what the son of man said, wasn't
[57:01] it? The son of man said get thee behind
[57:04] me Satan. That's all you got to do. Just
[57:05] say get behind me
[57:06] and move right on.
[57:10] which are the revelations contained in
[57:12] the seven seals. Look, it will be these
[57:14] divinely.
[57:17] And I'm going to tell you like I told
[57:18] the church I was preaching at the other
[57:20] day. If you can't if you
[57:23] I'm going have to say this delicately,
[57:25] Luis,
[57:27] delicately.
[57:30] If William Brand Brandham preached the
[57:32] seals, preached the thunders, preached
[57:35] the marriage and divorce, preached the
[57:36] Daniel 70 Weeks, preached all these
[57:39] great doctrines that everybody's so
[57:40] afraid of.
[57:43] And you got the Holy Ghost and tell me
[57:45] you can't understand them.
[57:49] Maybe you need to get the Holy Ghost.
[57:51] That's right.
[57:52] The real one,
[57:53] not the fake one. That's right, brother.
[57:58] How, listen. How can God speak through a
[58:02] prophet? Here we go again. How can God
[58:04] speak to a prophet and openly openly
[58:08] confess all these,00
[58:11] sermons and God preserved them? Let man
[58:14] preserve them. You've got them in your
[58:16] pocket on your phone now.
[58:18] Right, brother?
[58:19] And he's going to keep that from you. I
[58:21] thought Revelations 10:7 said he was
[58:22] going to tell you the mystery.
[58:25] Amen.
[58:26] So listen, our problem is we're not born
[58:28] again
[58:30] because how can you be born again and
[58:32] have the Holy Ghost and somebody preach
[58:34] you the word that's got the Holy Ghost
[58:35] and they don't coincide.
[58:37] Yeah,
[58:38] now there's a lot I don't understand.
[58:41] There's a lot you don't understand.
[58:43] But to say I ain't got to hear that,
[58:46] Uhuh. you cutting yourself off.
[58:48] That's right.
[58:49] I think the Bible calls that iniquity.
[58:51] That's right.
[58:53] Remember, the iniquity of the Amorites
[58:55] in the end time has to be completely
[58:57] full
[58:58] before God will come and bring a church
[59:00] us church to full maturity.
[59:03] Listen, we're going to come to maturity
[59:05] like the son of man came to maturity.
[59:07] Then we just get back in Matthew, Mark,
[59:08] Luke, and John and read what the son of
[59:10] man did. And that's what you got to do.
[59:12] That's right.
[59:15] Not Acts 238.
[59:20] Because Acts 2:38's the son of God,
[59:21] revelation.
[59:23] But the son of man is that man that
[59:25] stood there in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[59:27] John and declared who he was.
[59:30] Amen.
[59:32] Stand up one day and said, "I am the
[59:33] resurrection and the life."
[59:37] And then in John 17, he says, "Now I
[59:39] pray, Father, that he they be like me,
[59:41] like I'm like you." Now, where'd he get
[59:43] that word, I am the resurrection and the
[59:44] life?
[59:47] Where' brother say your resurrection
[59:48] was?
[59:52] It lies inside of you.
[59:54] That's right.
[59:56] What's going to bring
[59:59] Ray Gabriel out of the grave.
[1:00:02] Amen.
[1:00:03] What he had inside of him.
[1:00:04] That's right.
[1:00:05] He's got the resurrection inside of him.
[1:00:07] You said, "No, he's done passed on." No,
[1:00:09] that he ain't passed on.
[1:00:13] He's just not in this dimension.
[1:00:15] That's right.
[1:00:17] He's over there bothering Gary Atkins
[1:00:19] and Brother Dick.
[1:00:23] And Brother Tom's in there going, "Told
[1:00:25] y'all this is what it is. I told you it
[1:00:28] would be these divinely revealed." So,
[1:00:29] it has to be divinely revealed. It
[1:00:31] cannot be revealed by some novice. It
[1:00:34] has to be divinely revealed truths. Like
[1:00:36] I said before, that's the reason I
[1:00:38] believe this church has been so
[1:00:40] successful. Brother Dale has tackled all
[1:00:41] the major doctrines and nobody's ever
[1:00:44] been able to stand against the major
[1:00:45] doctrines
[1:00:46] with brother Dale preaching. No,
[1:00:48] ain't nobody got it like he's got it.
[1:00:50] Sorry.
[1:00:54] But now listen, he didn't keep it to
[1:00:55] himself.
[1:00:57] He's been giving it to us for 45 years.
[1:01:01] What have you done with it?
[1:01:04] And me, I was gone for 20 years.
[1:01:07] I was the devil's product.
[1:01:10] for 20 years. And I and I apologize for
[1:01:13] that. But you know what? God knew that.
[1:01:15] He wasn't nervous. He knew when you He
[1:01:18] knows when you're going to come back. He
[1:01:19] knows. But it will be these divinely
[1:01:22] revealed.
[1:01:24] So it's not going to come through the
[1:01:26] wall
[1:01:28] or a rock. It's going to come through a
[1:01:31] person. Not one person. Listen. No.
[1:01:34] Five-fold ministry.
[1:01:36] That's right.
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:37] Amen. five-fold ministry. It will be
[1:01:40] these divinely revealed
[1:01:42] mystery truths that literally, now
[1:01:45] remember that word literally. I'm not
[1:01:47] standing up here as a type.
[1:01:49] Right?
[1:01:50] You're looking at the literal person.
[1:01:52] Right?
[1:01:52] All right.
[1:01:54] That's why the son of man, now listen,
[1:01:56] he can't literally be here in the sense
[1:01:58] that he's going to be here in his body
[1:02:00] because you can't have two bodies on
[1:02:01] earth at the same time.
[1:02:03] But he declared that you were his body,
[1:02:06] right? And until we meet him in the air,
[1:02:08] this is the only body God's got.
[1:02:12] Prophet of God said, "Use your hands.
[1:02:14] Use your mouth. Use your feet."
[1:02:21] That literally turned the hearts of the
[1:02:23] children,
[1:02:25] children,
[1:02:27] babbling babies
[1:02:29] to the Pentecostal fathers. True
[1:02:32] Pentecost. Not a not a Pentecostal
[1:02:34] shouting experience, but a true
[1:02:36] Pentecost. So, there's the two things
[1:02:39] Malachi 4 is to do.
[1:02:42] Now, let's go to number two.
[1:02:45] And this will this will help us right
[1:02:46] here. Seal the deal.
[1:02:50] Now, he's been revealed through the
[1:02:51] church ages. Now, watch. Through the
[1:02:53] church ages as the son of God. That's
[1:02:55] what I've been talking to you for the
[1:02:56] past 30 minutes.
[1:02:58] So, I'm just reading you the quote to
[1:03:00] reiterate that it didn't come. It's not
[1:03:01] my private revelation. It came from the
[1:03:03] prophet of God. But I can see it.
[1:03:05] Listen, you ought to be able to see
[1:03:06] these things.
[1:03:08] When you get to where you just say,
[1:03:10] "Brother Bram said, you're just a
[1:03:11] parakeet."
[1:03:14] Right.
[1:03:14] Had a preacher say that one time. Stood
[1:03:16] up in a meeting and said, "I'm just,"
[1:03:17] didn't he? He said, "I'm just a message
[1:03:19] parakeet." And I thought, "Oh,
[1:03:22] exactly." That's all I heard.
[1:03:29] Sorry. It's time.
[1:03:31] It's time to be blunt.
[1:03:35] If we're going to make it, we're going
[1:03:36] to make it like they said we're going to
[1:03:38] make it. The prophet of God said we're
[1:03:39] going to make it. Not they, but the the
[1:03:41] Lord through the prophet.
[1:03:42] This is how we're going to make it. Or
[1:03:44] he would not have sent brother Brandham.
[1:03:45] That's right.
[1:03:46] He sent us a messenger to give us a way
[1:03:48] to get out of here.
[1:03:52] Now, down through the church ages, it
[1:03:54] was son of God. God being a spirit, the
[1:03:57] Holy Spirit, he revealed himself in the
[1:04:00] church age as in the congregation as the
[1:04:03] Holy Spirit among the people.
[1:04:06] We find in the layout of sin church age,
[1:04:08] the last church age, he's put out of the
[1:04:10] church.
[1:04:13] No, you know why he felt uncomfortable?
[1:04:15] Kind of like I said, I want one person
[1:04:16] to be uncomfortable today. I want the
[1:04:18] devil to be uncomfortable. You know
[1:04:19] what? God felt uncomfortable in the
[1:04:21] church.
[1:04:22] Right?
[1:04:23] Wow.
[1:04:25] That's what it says in Revelations 3,
[1:04:27] right? That he's on the outside of the
[1:04:29] door, outside of the outside of the door
[1:04:31] knocking. That's
[1:04:32] right.
[1:04:33] Nowhere else was he ever put out in any
[1:04:35] age but in the layout of sin age because
[1:04:38] they said we're rich have need of
[1:04:40] nothing. We don't need a prophet.
[1:04:43] Now they're saying we don't need a
[1:04:45] five-fold ministry.
[1:04:48] Right?
[1:04:50] You ain't gonna make it.
[1:04:52] You go ahead.
[1:04:54] You be one of them that goes through the
[1:04:56] tribulation and stands before the w of
[1:04:57] their own judgment.
[1:04:59] And know it not that you're miserable,
[1:05:01] poor, naked, blind, and don't know it.
[1:05:04] He was put out of the church age. And
[1:05:05] then according to Luke 17, he said, "As
[1:05:08] it was in the days of Sodom," we Lord,
[1:05:10] what a solemn condition we got. So shall
[1:05:12] it be in the coming of the son of man.
[1:05:15] Son of man, not son of God. Son of man.
[1:05:19] Now, he was reading the same Genesis
[1:05:21] that we read. Notice at Sodom what taken
[1:05:24] place. Now look,
[1:05:27] stop right here real quick. When we went
[1:05:30] to Thessalonians, it said there would be
[1:05:32] a shout, a voice, and a trump. Right.
[1:05:34] Everybody with me?
[1:05:35] Amen.
[1:05:36] You can sleep later. Don't sleep now.
[1:05:41] Michael, don't sleep. Big eyes always
[1:05:43] open.
[1:05:45] Now look
[1:05:48] in Thessalonians, something happens.
[1:05:52] There is not a requirement in any other
[1:05:54] church age for a resurrection.
[1:05:57] Right?
[1:05:57] If I don't get anything further, we'll
[1:05:58] we'll we'll kind of we may get to the
[1:06:00] two witnesses later on. We got to get we
[1:06:02] got to get the dead out of the ground
[1:06:03] first.
[1:06:05] Right.
[1:06:06] All right. We get the dead out of the
[1:06:07] ground, then we can talk about two
[1:06:08] witnesses.
[1:06:09] All right. So,
[1:06:12] we come to First Thessalonians. In First
[1:06:14] Thessalonians, though, is a requirement
[1:06:16] that we have three things happen,
[1:06:19] right?
[1:06:20] A shout,
[1:06:22] a voice,
[1:06:24] and a trump.
[1:06:25] Not any Not any shout, not any trump or
[1:06:30] any voice. It has to be the right one.
[1:06:33] Right?
[1:06:34] Because it has the resurrection message
[1:06:35] in it.
[1:06:37] Now, all those before even Luther,
[1:06:39] Wesley, and the first part of Brother
[1:06:41] Ram's message, there was a hope, there
[1:06:43] was a resurrection. Yes, sir. I know
[1:06:45] there's a resurre How many times go ask
[1:06:47] somebody when they think the
[1:06:49] resurrection is going to happen?
[1:06:52] Just go ask a Christian friend of yours
[1:06:54] or just somebody out in the
[1:06:54] denominational world, when do you think
[1:06:56] a rapture is going to take place and
[1:06:57] what what do you think it's going to be?
[1:06:59] Well, now grandma talked about that and
[1:07:02] and I think maybe it's in another time.
[1:07:06] What are they doing?
[1:07:10] It ain't going to happen in my time
[1:07:12] because I ain't ready.
[1:07:14] That's right. Right?
[1:07:16] No. The Bible says there's going to be a
[1:07:18] shout, a voice, and a trump, and then
[1:07:21] the dead in Christ shall rise first. You
[1:07:23] and I, because of the son of man
[1:07:27] ministry, the coming of the son of man
[1:07:29] is the shout. It is the voice and it is
[1:07:32] the trump.
[1:07:34] Amen. It's not the son of God. They
[1:07:35] never had those three in any other age.
[1:07:38] Right. Right.
[1:07:39] It took a prophet though to tell us what
[1:07:42] that is.
[1:07:43] denomination. What What is that? It's a
[1:07:46] shout.
[1:07:48] A voice.
[1:07:51] What does a shout do though?
[1:07:56] And it's an attention getter.
[1:07:59] Yes.
[1:08:00] See, see, she didn't go to So, see, do
[1:08:04] you see what I mean? The shout, when
[1:08:06] it's a shout, it gets your attention. I
[1:08:08] don't even care if I have said Louise.
[1:08:10] Everybody would have went
[1:08:12] Well, see, there was a shout, the
[1:08:14] message of the hour. They had been all
[1:08:16] through seven church. You okay? They
[1:08:23] got to quit doing that to older people.
[1:08:25] Uh
[1:08:28] that you Bella said, do it to me. Do it
[1:08:30] to me.
[1:08:31] Okay.
[1:08:32] But here we've come down though to this
[1:08:33] church age.
[1:08:35] They they've had minor shouts and boy,
[1:08:38] but they've not had the three. And it
[1:08:40] took a prophet to tell us exactly what
[1:08:42] that is.
[1:08:44] And it's and it's a requirement for you
[1:08:47] and me. What is that shout voice and
[1:08:49] trumpet? It's the son of man descending
[1:08:53] from heaven into me and you.
[1:08:57] Not another, not Wesley, not Luther, not
[1:08:59] all those different ones. But that was
[1:09:01] it took a prophet to break those down.
[1:09:04] Right?
[1:09:05] You know what's a great what really gets
[1:09:07] me? Go read Revelations 10. Now, all the
[1:09:10] way through the Bible,
[1:09:13] when you see a capital A, it's most the
[1:09:16] time is the angel of the covenant or or
[1:09:18] the mighty angel or I mean an angel. But
[1:09:22] go to Revelations 10. God hid that thing
[1:09:24] so much. He used a little a
[1:09:28] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:09:30] with a book in his hand.
[1:09:33] Prophet of God said, "Only Christ
[1:09:36] could that be."
[1:09:38] So he put that focus on, oh well, we
[1:09:40] wouldn't have known that if we keep
[1:09:41] looking through the Bible. Usually the
[1:09:43] big A means Christ. The big A is the
[1:09:45] angel of the covenant.
[1:09:46] Yo, the capital A.
[1:09:48] But he hid it.
[1:09:50] But it took a little prophet to walk out
[1:09:51] one day and he said Revelations 10:1. He
[1:09:54] said only Christ could that be.
[1:09:57] That's it.
[1:09:58] Hidden in simplicity.
[1:09:59] Amen.
[1:10:00] Hidden in the word of God, but given to
[1:10:02] me and you.
[1:10:03] Now listen, William Brandon was not the
[1:10:05] son of man.
[1:10:06] That's right. You know why he wasn't the
[1:10:07] son of man? Let me prove to you. If
[1:10:10] anybody tells you he was the son of man,
[1:10:12] say, "Look, here's the characteristics
[1:10:14] of the son of man right here. He's got
[1:10:16] to be virgin born."
[1:10:19] That way with William Brandham right
[1:10:21] there,
[1:10:24] didn't have any children, didn't have a
[1:10:26] wife,
[1:10:28] took a Nazerite vow. Just keep just keep
[1:10:31] you'll clear everybody out, but that
[1:10:32] first one's going to clear them out big
[1:10:33] time. That's right.
[1:10:35] The son of man was virgin born
[1:10:38] now. A son of man
[1:10:41] can be sex like we are
[1:10:43] but come into the revelation of the son
[1:10:46] of man. Is that all right?
[1:10:48] We okay.
[1:10:52] Now look at number three.
[1:10:56] The queen of Sheba.
[1:10:59] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:11:00] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:11:02] the son of man. Look at that angel down
[1:11:05] there to the church elect and what he
[1:11:06] done. Look at Jesus what he done in his
[1:11:08] generation. Look down here at this
[1:11:10] generation what he's doing now. Now he
[1:11:12] brought it right there right to here to
[1:11:14] that generation.
[1:11:16] They'll receive a sign but they won't
[1:11:18] believe it.
[1:11:22] They will receive a sign but they won't
[1:11:25] believe it.
[1:11:27] Now there you are. But it comes just the
[1:11:29] same. An evil and adulterous generation.
[1:11:32] Look, they're seeking after a sign,
[1:11:34] right?
[1:11:35] That's why you see these people rise up
[1:11:37] with some kind of maybe some um
[1:11:40] discernment or or great healings in
[1:11:42] their campaign. People just flock to
[1:11:44] them. It doesn't matter if they're
[1:11:45] trinitarians, fourness, fiveness, and
[1:11:47] got eight wives. It don't matter. It's
[1:11:48] just there. Oh, it's just wonderful.
[1:11:50] Let's just go.
[1:11:51] Yeah.
[1:11:52] Right.
[1:11:53] Because they're seeking out. Listen,
[1:11:54] everybody's looking after a sign.
[1:11:57] That's right. That's right.
[1:11:58] You drive down the road, you're looking
[1:12:00] at a sign.
[1:12:03] Everybody's looking for a sign. But an
[1:12:06] evil and adulterous generation will seek
[1:12:08] after a sign and they'll have it. It'll
[1:12:11] be given to them. As Jonas was in the
[1:12:14] belly of the whale three days and
[1:12:15] nights, so the son of man will be in the
[1:12:17] heart of the earth three days and
[1:12:18] nights. Look, but the resurrection
[1:12:21] will be the sign.
[1:12:23] Yes.
[1:12:25] And the resurrection sign is given to
[1:12:27] the church in this last day. What's he
[1:12:29] talking about? He's talking about that
[1:12:30] healing campaign that went out, the
[1:12:32] natural healing campaign that saw the
[1:12:34] dead raised, the sick healed. More
[1:12:36] people were healed in one service of
[1:12:38] William Brandham than the all of Jesus's
[1:12:40] life. Right.
[1:12:43] Proven.
[1:12:45] Proven. 200,000 people.
[1:12:49] Remember him telling about going to
[1:12:50] India and they they woke him up that
[1:12:52] morning and they said, "Look." And he
[1:12:54] said they were army cars, like army
[1:12:57] transport cars that had crutches and and
[1:13:01] um
[1:13:02] crutches and wheelchairs stacked to the
[1:13:05] top. That's how many people got healed
[1:13:07] in his message.
[1:13:09] But see, that was temporary.
[1:13:11] That was a temporary resurrection. When
[1:13:13] he started preaching the message, the
[1:13:15] seals in 1963 all the way up to when he
[1:13:18] passed away. That was a resurrection
[1:13:20] message.
[1:13:22] That they got a sign.
[1:13:24] What was the sign to do?
[1:13:26] What did he say it was? Bait on the
[1:13:28] hook.
[1:13:29] That's right.
[1:13:29] Not the hook.
[1:13:31] You don't catch the fish with the bait,
[1:13:32] but you do.
[1:13:35] If you if you just got a hook out there,
[1:13:37] most time they won't bite it.
[1:13:39] But you put the bait on that hook where
[1:13:40] you don't they can't see the hook,
[1:13:43] right?
[1:13:43] And then they come up there to get that
[1:13:45] piece of meat and when they do, they get
[1:13:47] hooked.
[1:13:48] But let me tell you something. Only an
[1:13:50] eagle will get hooked.
[1:13:54] All those others, them catfish and
[1:13:56] bottom dwellers,
[1:14:01] they don't get they don't get it. But a
[1:14:03] real eagle will get hooked.
[1:14:06] Look, the angel of the Holy Spirit in
[1:14:09] the me in the meeting showing the same
[1:14:10] thing, doing the same thing across the
[1:14:12] nation, proving that Jesus Christ has
[1:14:14] raised from the dead just the same
[1:14:16] yesterday, today, and forever. That's
[1:14:17] the generation that will receive it.
[1:14:22] Everybody got that?
[1:14:25] Now, let's read Job 14:12.
[1:14:28] So man lith down and riseth not till the
[1:14:31] heavens be no more.
[1:14:32] They shall not awake, nor be raised out
[1:14:34] of their sleep. Oh, that thou wouldest
[1:14:37] hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
[1:14:40] keep me secret until thy wrath be
[1:14:42] passed. That thou wouldest appoint me a
[1:14:44] set time and remember me. Don't throw me
[1:14:47] out there and forget me.
[1:14:49] Right?
[1:14:49] If a man die, shall he live again? All
[1:14:52] the days of my appointed time will I
[1:14:53] wait till my change comes.
[1:14:57] Amen. That's right.
[1:14:59] Job was an Old Testament prophet and he
[1:15:01] still knew there had to be a body change
[1:15:02] because remember he always said he said
[1:15:04] a man goes down and he rots and he dies
[1:15:06] and he don't come back.
[1:15:08] He just got a revelation till my chains
[1:15:11] come. Now look, thou shalt call
[1:15:16] and I will answer thee.
[1:15:19] Who's thou? That's the Lord Jesus. We
[1:15:22] know that's the resurrection man. But
[1:15:24] now where's the resurrection now though?
[1:15:26] Jesus is not coming back to speak the
[1:15:27] resurrection. It's in me and you.
[1:15:29] Right?
[1:15:30] See, you put yourself That's why I said
[1:15:32] we put ourselves so far out of the
[1:15:34] message. Brother Ram said, "If you don't
[1:15:35] see Christ in every verse, read it
[1:15:37] again." Well, where's Christ?
[1:15:39] In the book, in in the pew,
[1:15:44] in this building?
[1:15:45] How about in you?
[1:15:47] I think that's Paul. Paul said that was
[1:15:48] one of the greatest mysteries was Christ
[1:15:50] in you, the hope of glory.
[1:15:51] Right? Thou shalt call and I will answer
[1:15:55] thee. Thou walt have a desire to the
[1:15:58] work of thine hands. Let's read this
[1:16:00] right here. Everybody all right? We okay
[1:16:04] not nervous? We only been going an hour.
[1:16:06] Resurrection is a state of having passed
[1:16:08] completely through death and having
[1:16:10] risen from death.
[1:16:14] All right. To be in resurrection is
[1:16:16] different than to be alive. To be alive
[1:16:19] is the original state without having
[1:16:21] passed through death.
[1:16:23] Pretty self-explanatory. To be in
[1:16:25] resurrection is to have passed through
[1:16:27] death and been raised up.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:30] And who went through that? The son of
[1:16:32] man.
[1:16:33] The son of man went through death,
[1:16:35] burial, resurrection, body change, and
[1:16:37] ascension. Everybody all right with
[1:16:38] that?
[1:16:40] All right. All of Christendom is based
[1:16:42] on resurrection.
[1:16:44] Let's read 1 Corinthians 5 51 15:12
[1:16:47] because we got Listen, like I said
[1:16:49] before, and and don't get me wrong, we
[1:16:51] all want the rapture to take place.
[1:16:55] But the rapture can't take place
[1:16:58] with dead bodies in the ground,
[1:16:59] right?
[1:17:00] It can't. Listen, the rapture can't take
[1:17:02] place with a sixth dimension full of
[1:17:03] people,
[1:17:04] right?
[1:17:06] That's the bride, folks.
[1:17:08] The bride's got to come back here.
[1:17:10] Didn't that angel even tell brother
[1:17:11] Brandham said, "You've got to go back to
[1:17:14] earth."
[1:17:16] That's right.
[1:17:18] So, that's what they're doing. They're
[1:17:20] waiting on us so they can get back here.
[1:17:21] And the reason they ain't got back here
[1:17:25] is because death hadn't been destroyed
[1:17:26] in a group of people yet.
[1:17:28] That's right.
[1:17:29] Why would you want to come from no death
[1:17:31] to back to death again? Yeah.
[1:17:33] No, somebody the alive and remain is
[1:17:35] going to have to stand one day as the
[1:17:37] prophet of God said and death move up
[1:17:40] your sleeve and you just wipe it off
[1:17:41] like it's nothing like a tooth less than
[1:17:43] a toothache.
[1:17:44] Oh, that can't happen. Then you'll never
[1:17:46] make it.
[1:17:47] Amen.
[1:17:49] Now, if Christ be preached that he rose
[1:17:50] from the dead, how say some among you
[1:17:52] that there's no resurrection of the
[1:17:54] dead? But if there's no resurrection of
[1:17:56] the dead, then is Christ not risen? And
[1:17:59] if Christ be not risen, then our
[1:18:01] preaching is in vain.
[1:18:03] Go to the house.
[1:18:05] Amen.
[1:18:07] What are we here for?
[1:18:08] That's it.
[1:18:10] So listen, let our focus not be on the
[1:18:12] rapture, though. Let our focus be on the
[1:18:15] resurrection.
[1:18:16] That's got to happen first.
[1:18:19] The dead in Christ shall rise
[1:18:21] first.
[1:18:22] And if Christ be not risen, then is our
[1:18:24] preaching vain? And our faith is also
[1:18:27] vain.
[1:18:28] Wow. Our faith is also vain. Let's go to
[1:18:31] the next one real quick.
[1:18:34] Excuse me.
[1:18:37] Lord have mercy. 1 Corinthians 15:20.
[1:18:41] Continuation. But now is Christ risen
[1:18:43] from the dead. Paul's telling them
[1:18:45] Corinthians. Now he has risen from the
[1:18:46] dead and become the first fruits of them
[1:18:48] that slept. For since by man came death,
[1:18:51] Adam, by man came also the resurrection
[1:18:54] of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so
[1:18:57] in Christ shall all be made alive, but
[1:19:00] every man in his own order.
[1:19:05] First shall be last, the last shall be
[1:19:06] first. Our church age is going to come
[1:19:08] up first and the next one after that and
[1:19:10] then the next one after that.
[1:19:12] Boy, what a time we're going to have.
[1:19:13] Talking about a youth camp.
[1:19:16] They'll be all about 18, 20 years old.
[1:19:18] All of them from Paul to us.
[1:19:21] Right. Oh, brother Curtis, this is a
[1:19:24] this is the quietest you'll ever hear.
[1:19:27] You wait till them young kids start
[1:19:29] coming back. Start coming back in this
[1:19:30] dimension that were old when we put them
[1:19:32] in the ground.
[1:19:35] Oh my.
[1:19:37] But every man in his own order, Christ
[1:19:39] the first fruits, afterwards they that
[1:19:41] are Christ at his coming. So now let's
[1:19:44] go to Revelations 20:4.
[1:19:47] And I saw thrones.
[1:19:50] Wow, this is going to prove my my
[1:19:52] theory. It's going to prove my theory.
[1:19:55] There's not one throne at the judgment.
[1:19:57] There's thrones.
[1:19:59] And I saw thrones and they sat upon
[1:20:01] them. Who? The bride. And judgment was
[1:20:04] given unto them.
[1:20:08] H because the Bible says the saints will
[1:20:10] judge the earth. And that will even
[1:20:12] judge angels. You know, the Bible tells
[1:20:14] us that if we have a problem with a
[1:20:16] brother,
[1:20:20] What are you supposed to do?
[1:20:22] Go to the law, go sue him, take him to
[1:20:24] take him out there and pay $10,000 to a
[1:20:26] lawyer.
[1:20:26] You're supposed to come right here
[1:20:29] and let the pastor and the deacons and
[1:20:32] the elders judge instead of spending
[1:20:34] your money. Hope there's no lawyers in
[1:20:36] here, but spending spending no money on
[1:20:40] a lawyer when you can the the the Bible
[1:20:43] says the saints will judge the earth.
[1:20:44] Why go to somebody outside? Why go to a
[1:20:46] heathen because they're going to only go
[1:20:48] by the law and not have any grace
[1:20:50] involved.
[1:20:50] Right. Right.
[1:20:51] And I saw the souls of them that were
[1:20:52] beheaded for the witness of Jesus and
[1:20:54] for the word of God and which had not
[1:20:57] worshiped the beast. Now this is the
[1:20:58] bride. Neither his image. Neither had
[1:21:00] received his mark on their forehead or
[1:21:01] in their hand because remember everybody
[1:21:02] that's got a mark is the mark of the
[1:21:04] beast. They lived and reigned with
[1:21:06] Christ a thousand years. But the rest of
[1:21:07] the dead live not again until the
[1:21:10] thousand years were finished. This is
[1:21:12] the first resurrection. So that's what
[1:21:13] we're involved in.
[1:21:16] We're involved in the first
[1:21:17] resurrection. Blessed and holy is he
[1:21:19] that hath part in the first
[1:21:20] resurrection. On such the second death
[1:21:23] hath no power because remember at the
[1:21:25] white throne judgment, you've got people
[1:21:27] that have died
[1:21:28] physically. You got me?
[1:21:30] But they never were spiritually alive.
[1:21:32] They had no new birth. They're going to
[1:21:34] have to come out and be killed again.
[1:21:37] Second death. That's why they call it a
[1:21:39] second death. Right?
[1:21:40] You don't want to be involved in that
[1:21:41] second death because if you come up in
[1:21:43] the first resurrection,
[1:21:45] you don't die no more.
[1:21:46] Right?
[1:21:47] You're not dead anyway.
[1:21:48] Right?
[1:21:49] You never have died. There's never a
[1:21:51] Christian ever died.
[1:21:52] Right.
[1:21:53] Never.
[1:21:53] That's right.
[1:21:54] And know what the Bible says two or
[1:21:55] three times. It says they sleepeth. They
[1:21:57] sleep. They sleeping. They're sleeping.
[1:21:59] And but they shall be priests of God and
[1:22:01] of Christ and shall reign with him 1,000
[1:22:04] years. Now, let's go back to First
[1:22:06] Thessalonians. And I think we'll stop
[1:22:08] right here. We won't get we won't get to
[1:22:10] the uh
[1:22:12] I'd like to get to that, but we won't
[1:22:13] get to it right now with the two
[1:22:16] witnesses.
[1:22:18] But I would not have you ignorant,
[1:22:20] brethren, concerning them which are
[1:22:22] asleep, that you sorrow not as others
[1:22:25] which have no hope.
[1:22:28] For if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:22:29] rose again, then so them also which
[1:22:32] sleep in Jesus sleep.
[1:22:35] You hear what I sleep? complete
[1:22:38] in Jesus will God bring with him. For
[1:22:40] this we say unto you by the word of the
[1:22:42] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[1:22:44] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:22:46] prevent or the prophet of God said
[1:22:48] hinder them which are sleep for the Lord
[1:22:52] himself. Now here's what's got to
[1:22:53] happen. That's why I brought it back up
[1:22:54] again. For the Lord himself himself.
[1:22:58] So it's got to be a son of man ministry.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:01] Right.
[1:23:02] Got to be a son of man ministry in a
[1:23:03] group of people with a shout because
[1:23:06] he's not going to listen. He's given us
[1:23:08] everything we need.
[1:23:10] He sent us a messenger to tell us what
[1:23:12] that where that shout come from
[1:23:14] and tell us where the voice came from
[1:23:17] and the what the trump of God is. And
[1:23:19] look, and the dead in Christ shall
[1:23:21] write. You say, "Oh, brother, that's
[1:23:23] dead." No, that's the one
[1:23:26] that's already dead now.
[1:23:28] That's right.
[1:23:33] Every one of you that's born again
[1:23:37] is dead
[1:23:39] in Christ.
[1:23:41] Not dead physically. If you're born
[1:23:43] again, you are dead in Christ. Because
[1:23:46] listen, remember, you got to die
[1:23:50] before you can marry Christ.
[1:23:52] Your old husband has got to be dead,
[1:23:55] right?
[1:23:56] All right. and the dead in Christ shall
[1:24:00] rise first.
[1:24:01] Amen.
[1:24:02] Then
[1:24:04] we which are alive and remain
[1:24:10] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:24:11] the cloud to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:24:13] So shall we ever be with the Lord. Let's
[1:24:16] go to 1 Corinthians 15 51. I want to
[1:24:19] read a few more and then we'll close.
[1:24:21] Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall
[1:24:23] not all sleep, but we shall be changed.
[1:24:28] But now watch, you got to be careful.
[1:24:30] You got to you got to watch the the
[1:24:31] process. In a moment, in the twinkling
[1:24:33] of an eye, at the last trump, it said,
[1:24:35] "What at the trump here? For the trumpet
[1:24:37] shall sound, and the dead shall be
[1:24:39] raised incorruptible
[1:24:42] and we shall be changed."
[1:24:45] Right?
[1:24:47] You see, we got to have something. We
[1:24:48] got to have a resurrection in here
[1:24:50] before there's a resurrection of this
[1:24:52] guy.
[1:24:52] Right.
[1:24:53] That's right.
[1:24:54] Now, listen. You're already resurrected
[1:24:55] sitting in heavenly places in your soul.
[1:24:58] We know that.
[1:25:00] Can't harm it. I don't care if they drop
[1:25:02] a nuclear bomb right here. You can't you
[1:25:04] can't nuclear bomb a soul
[1:25:06] if it's God.
[1:25:08] But they're going to be raised
[1:25:10] incorruptible. We are going to literally
[1:25:12] see the dead come out of the ground
[1:25:15] in a glorified body before while we're
[1:25:18] still doing this.
[1:25:22] You better get out of the way.
[1:25:26] That's the great mystery. We think it's
[1:25:29] all a boy, one day I'm going I'm coming
[1:25:32] to church and as soon as I walk up that
[1:25:34] aisle, these gray hairs are going to
[1:25:36] fall out. Now, some of y'all we don't do
[1:25:37] that in a bottle, but you gray hairs
[1:25:41] your gray hairs going to fall. No, that
[1:25:43] ain't going to happen.
[1:25:45] We're going to be probably at the lowest
[1:25:47] of our low.
[1:25:53] Not 80, not years, Trudy.
[1:25:57] We because your numbers keep getting
[1:25:59] higher. Okay. Maybe we'll be at the
[1:26:01] highest of our highest of our numbers.
[1:26:04] But maybe we'll be the lowest of the
[1:26:06] low, darkest hour of our whole time of
[1:26:07] our life.
[1:26:09] That's it.
[1:26:11] Okay, let's go back to the son of man. I
[1:26:13] got to I got to cover this. Let's go
[1:26:15] back to the son of man. The last week of
[1:26:17] his life was at a party.
[1:26:24] He was beat, scorged,
[1:26:29] catine tales beat his back. And when he
[1:26:32] went to Pilate's hall, totally alone.
[1:26:37] Even his trusted disciples
[1:26:40] were not anywhere to be found.
[1:26:43] He stood alone
[1:26:45] in Pilot's hall.
[1:26:48] Darkest hour. He knew he was going to
[1:26:50] Calvary. He knew what was going to
[1:26:52] happen. But you know what inside of him?
[1:26:57] He said, "I got to do this for Luis
[1:26:58] Ureo.
[1:27:00] Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:01] I got to do this for Wayade Dale. I got
[1:27:04] to do this for put your name in there."
[1:27:06] So, according to the son of man, it
[1:27:08] looked like they killed the son of man
[1:27:09] and he just went off to nothing. And I
[1:27:11] mean, I'm sure Kyus and them was like,
[1:27:13] "Glad we're done with that guy. Just
[1:27:15] throw him over in a pile somewhere with
[1:27:16] the other ones and his body will rot and
[1:27:18] we'll never have to see him again." Oh,
[1:27:21] was he surprised.
[1:27:24] Oh, was he surprised.
[1:27:27] Cuz a couple days later, that man came
[1:27:29] out of the tomb.
[1:27:30] The son of man was raised incorruptible.
[1:27:35] But here we go. And we shall be changed.
[1:27:37] For this corruptible must put on
[1:27:39] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[1:27:42] on immortality. So when this corruptible
[1:27:45] shall have put on incorruption, and this
[1:27:47] mortal shall have put on immortality,
[1:27:49] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:27:51] that is written,
[1:27:54] and that's in the Old Testament if you
[1:27:55] want to look it up.
[1:27:57] Death is swallowed up in victory.
[1:28:00] Amen.
[1:28:00] Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave,
[1:28:03] where is thy victory? The sting of death
[1:28:04] is sin, and the strength of sin is the
[1:28:06] law. But thanks be to God which giveth
[1:28:08] us the victory through our Lord
[1:28:11] Jesus Christ.
[1:28:14] Let's read this right here and then
[1:28:15] we'll stop. Musicians, get ready to
[1:28:17] come. Revelations 4:1.
[1:28:20] Now listen. We've come through seven
[1:28:23] church ages. We've now come through a
[1:28:26] resurrection.
[1:28:28] The voice being in the bride. The
[1:28:30] resurrection has happened. The people
[1:28:32] have been changed. We have been changed.
[1:28:35] And we're going to still be around here
[1:28:36] 30, 40 days,
[1:28:38] right? According to the prophet, we're
[1:28:39] going to be around here 30 40 days. I
[1:28:41] think I got that on my chart.
[1:28:42] 30 40 days. Then what's going to happen
[1:28:45] then? Like I said before,
[1:28:47] and listen, I don't get people I don't
[1:28:49] get all upset when people say, "Boy, I
[1:28:50] just I'm waiting on the rapture. I wish
[1:28:53] the rapture take place, but you're way
[1:28:55] you're like three positions out of the
[1:28:57] way. I don't want the rapture to take
[1:29:00] place. I want the resurrection to take
[1:29:02] place."
[1:29:02] Right? Amen.
[1:29:03] Listen, if we see the resurrection take
[1:29:06] place, you got to go in the rapture.
[1:29:09] To me, the rapture is an event.
[1:29:11] It's something that's going to happen
[1:29:13] because of
[1:29:15] it's not just an automatic process.
[1:29:18] Well, I just hope the rapture comes. You
[1:29:19] better hope the resurrection comes
[1:29:20] first.
[1:29:22] After this,
[1:29:24] now this is after Revelations 3 1, two,
[1:29:26] and three, the church ages. After this,
[1:29:29] in other words, after the church ages, I
[1:29:32] looked and behold a door because
[1:29:33] remember the prophet of God tells us
[1:29:35] Revelations 4:1, the bride goes up.
[1:29:37] There was a door opened in heaven. And
[1:29:40] the first voice which I heard was as it
[1:29:42] were of a trumpet
[1:29:46] talking with me, which said, "Come up
[1:29:48] hither, and I will show thee things
[1:29:50] which must be hereafter." And
[1:29:53] immediately I was in the spirit, and
[1:29:55] behold,
[1:29:57] one throne. Listen,
[1:30:01] John's revelation is what took him in
[1:30:03] the in the rapture.
[1:30:07] When he looked on the earth, he saw one
[1:30:09] man.
[1:30:11] And when he went to the aisle of Patmas,
[1:30:12] he saw that same man again.
[1:30:15] He saw the Lord Jesus.
[1:30:17] And there was a throne set in heaven and
[1:30:20] one sitting on the throne. His
[1:30:23] revelation took him from earth through
[1:30:25] that open door into heaven. Same thing's
[1:30:28] going to happen to you. Your revelation
[1:30:30] will take you
[1:30:32] either take you to a mortal grave
[1:30:38] or you can be we which are alive and
[1:30:40] remain.
[1:30:43] You know what? It's your choice because
[1:30:45] now is the time.
[1:30:50] They're going to keep him. Let me read
[1:30:52] this real quick. Is that okay? They're
[1:30:54] going to keep him and do an echo
[1:30:56] cardiogram on his heart and a brain
[1:30:57] scan. Also, he had fluid on his lungs
[1:30:59] and his legs which needs to come off and
[1:31:01] tell everybody he's watching.
[1:31:04] So, wait a minute. Oh my goodness. He's
[1:31:08] watching. So, they better be good. Man,
[1:31:11] you can't get away. Not in this day and
[1:31:13] time.
[1:31:14] But I've already sent a um
[1:31:18] Oh, Terrence said, "You better be good.
[1:31:19] Daddy's watching." So,
[1:31:24] I just sent a message before I came out
[1:31:25] here to brother Dutch Scott. You know,
[1:31:27] he's got that email. He said, and my
[1:31:30] phone just blowing up and praying for
[1:31:32] the pop.
[1:31:33] Amen.
[1:31:34] Amen. So, let's musicians come. But
[1:31:36] that's what we're looking for, folks.
[1:31:37] We're looking for a resurrection.
[1:31:39] Amen.
[1:31:39] We're looking for a message that will
[1:31:41] take us the opening of the seals. The
[1:31:43] open. You say, "I don't understand."
[1:31:45] Find you somewhere where you can
[1:31:48] because God's not going to wait on you.
[1:31:49] He's already give us 2,000 years.
[1:31:53] That's right.
[1:31:58] But don't let me don't let me hurt your
[1:32:00] feelings, but I'm telling you, there's a
[1:32:02] lot of people in this message sitting in
[1:32:03] a message church that don't have the
[1:32:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:06] Or they wouldn't do the things they do.
[1:32:09] You can't leave this message and have
[1:32:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:12] Amen.
[1:32:13] Never. Can't look at me and tell me you
[1:32:15] got the Holy Ghost and you deny this
[1:32:17] message. You're the biggest liar besides
[1:32:19] the devil.
[1:32:21] How in the world can God deny God?
[1:32:25] Can't happen.
[1:32:27] They ask you, they told him he was
[1:32:28] Belgub one time. You know what he said?
[1:32:30] He said, "Can Satan cast out Satan?"
[1:32:33] In other words, how why would you want
[1:32:34] to cast out your good guy?
[1:32:36] Amen.
[1:32:37] Amen.
[1:32:39] And you know what? It would be it would
[1:32:42] be truly wonderful if you could get
[1:32:45] everybody to realize they didn't have
[1:32:47] the new birth.
[1:32:48] Amen.
[1:32:51] Because you could work on it,
[1:32:52] right?
[1:32:53] Because God said he'd give it to you if
[1:32:54] you want it.
[1:32:55] If you walk around all your life and say
[1:32:57] you got it and you don't,
[1:33:01] blind, wretched, miserable, naked, and
[1:33:04] don't know it,
[1:33:07] that's the spirit of this age. Right.
[1:33:10] I got it cuz I got all 1100 sermons and
[1:33:12] I go to brother so and so's church and
[1:33:14] he makes me happy.
[1:33:18] That's all right. But has God done
[1:33:21] something for you
[1:33:23] at that church?
[1:33:25] Has God spoke to you
[1:33:28] wherever you go?
[1:33:30] I'm just saying it's just to me it's
[1:33:32] plain. We need to quit all this running
[1:33:34] around stuff. Get settled with God.
[1:33:37] Yes.
[1:33:38] Cuz remember, let me one more time. The
[1:33:40] son of man, he never was rattled. Ever.
[1:33:44] Now, if we have if without the ministry
[1:33:46] that's back here, that's the ministry we
[1:33:47] got to have. He was never rattled.
[1:33:49] Storm.
[1:33:51] Peace. Be still.
[1:33:53] Right.
[1:33:54] Maniac comes up.
[1:33:58] Go.
[1:34:01] Oh,
[1:34:03] my baby's dead. Jesus said, "No, I'm
[1:34:05] just sleeping. Right? And now he said,
[1:34:08] "No, just leave him." He grabbed him by
[1:34:10] the hand. Didn't pray. Didn't shake him.
[1:34:11] Didn't have to go through a prayer line.
[1:34:14] He reached and grabbed her with the
[1:34:16] authority of God and raised her up with
[1:34:18] just See, that's what I'm looking for,
[1:34:20] folks. I'm not looking for a Pentecostal
[1:34:23] revival
[1:34:25] like the old Pentecost.
[1:34:27] Now, remember, I preached on revival for
[1:34:29] 20some services. You know what a revival
[1:34:31] is. But listen, brother Brown told us,
[1:34:34] he said, "If you want to see the
[1:34:36] greatest anointing and greatest power
[1:34:40] is when Jesus walked into the temple in
[1:34:43] Luke chapter 4,
[1:34:45] read your read your message. The
[1:34:46] greatest anointing ever hit the earth
[1:34:50] was when Jesus screamed and hollered and
[1:34:52] shook and run the aisles and screamed,
[1:34:58] they handed him the Bible." Yeah.
[1:35:01] And I'm sure he probably did shake a
[1:35:02] little bit inside because he was the one
[1:35:04] that wrote it.
[1:35:06] And he didn't go, "Well, now wait a
[1:35:08] minute. I'm familiar with this. I'm the
[1:35:09] one that wrote it." No, he just pulls
[1:35:12] over there and he says,
[1:35:14] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me."
[1:35:16] Amen.
[1:35:19] What did he do? He identified where he
[1:35:22] was.
[1:35:25] And what did he do? He closed the book.
[1:35:28] Only God can close a book and open a
[1:35:29] book. God closed the book and handed it
[1:35:32] back to the people. Remember, he handed
[1:35:34] them a closed book.
[1:35:39] Come on now. He handed him a closed
[1:35:41] book.
[1:35:42] Preach. Okay. Come back Wednesday night.
[1:35:45] You hear the rest of this. Stand to your
[1:35:46] feet, please.
[1:35:52] But Jesus handed him a closed book and
[1:35:54] the Bible said precious words proceeded
[1:35:57] from his mouth. He identified who he was
[1:36:00] in the word.
[1:36:01] Amen.
[1:36:01] And that was the greatest anointing that
[1:36:04] ever was. And that's what you and I once
[1:36:05] you figure out what you are, who you
[1:36:07] are, and what part of the word you are,
[1:36:09] Satan can't shake you, folks.
[1:36:11] Amen.
[1:36:12] Okay? Satan can't shake you when you
[1:36:13] tell him you're a child of God because
[1:36:14] he's not one,
[1:36:16] and he can't be one. don't know how to
[1:36:18] be one.
[1:36:19] Right.
[1:36:20] Oh man. Come on. Um anyway, go. No, you
[1:36:22] going to preach Wednesday night. Let's
[1:36:24] sing a song.
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:27] There's a river of life flowing out of
[1:36:32] me.
[1:36:33] Makes the lame to walk and the blind to
[1:36:37] see.
[1:36:39] Open the door sets the captives free.
[1:36:44] Oh, there's a river of life flowing out
[1:36:48] from me. Bring up a well
[1:36:52] within my soul.
[1:36:54] Bring up a well
[1:36:57] and make me whole.
[1:37:00] Bring up the well
[1:37:03] and give to me
[1:37:06] that life abundantly.
[1:37:11] Oh, there's a river of life flowing out.
[1:37:15] You're the only life this world has the
[1:37:18] lane to walk.
[1:37:20] When you leave this world, there'll be
[1:37:21] no life in this world.
[1:37:23] Open
[1:37:25] death. And that's when the wrath of
[1:37:26] God's going to be poured out.
[1:37:28] There is a river of God. Lord, judge us
[1:37:31] now. So, we have to be judged.
[1:37:36] within my soul.
[1:37:38] Bring up a well
[1:37:41] and make me whole.
[1:37:44] Bring up a well
[1:37:47] and give to me
[1:37:50] that.
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:37:55] Oh, there's a river of life flowing out
[1:37:59] of me.
[1:38:01] makes a lane to walk and the blind to
[1:38:05] see.
[1:38:07] Open the door sets a captive free. Oh,
[1:38:12] there's a river of life going in and out
[1:38:16] of me. Drink up a well
[1:38:19] within my soul.
[1:38:22] Bring up a well
[1:38:25] and make me whole.
[1:38:27] bring up well
[1:38:30] and give to me
[1:38:34] that life abundantly.
[1:38:38] Brother Bam comes up to that little
[1:38:40] little water trickling up out of the
[1:38:41] ground. He said if I could talk to him,
[1:38:45] he said I said, "Oh, you're here to
[1:38:48] what? You're here to feed the deer."
[1:38:51] Water's like, "No,
[1:38:54] I don't know what you know. I just
[1:38:56] there's something inside.
[1:38:59] There's something way down in the earth.
[1:39:02] I was reading an article the other day.
[1:39:04] One of those Aaron may know it. He's the
[1:39:08] he's the brains around this place.
[1:39:13] It's okay, Sarah.
[1:39:17] But there's 20 something million gallons
[1:39:19] of water somewhere in Florida that
[1:39:22] pushes up out of those live springs
[1:39:26] in a day.
[1:39:31] And that's natural. That's the pressure
[1:39:34] of the earth
[1:39:36] pushing water out. And brother Brown
[1:39:37] meets this little bitty spring that's
[1:39:39] just, you know, just bubbling up a
[1:39:41] little bit. And he says, "What are you
[1:39:43] here for?" He said, "I don't He said,
[1:39:44] "But there's something inside."
[1:39:46] That's right.
[1:39:47] And it's pushing.
[1:39:50] You can watch those little videos. I was
[1:39:51] watching it where you could see the the
[1:39:53] actually the the fish couldn't hardly
[1:39:55] swim over the top of it because there
[1:39:56] was so much force of the water coming
[1:39:58] out. That's natural. What about a
[1:39:59] spiritual live well?
[1:40:02] What about a well of living water
[1:40:05] flowing out from me and you take that
[1:40:07] with you Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[1:40:09] Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Do
[1:40:10] we come back?
[1:40:12] Wet somebody.
[1:40:14] That's right.
[1:40:15] Amen. Let somebody get wet. Drink some
[1:40:17] of that good cold water.
[1:40:19] Amen. Just remember, brother Dale, like
[1:40:21] I said before, that if they're going to
[1:40:22] keep him, then we may all try to go up
[1:40:25] there. I don't know if it'll let us in.
[1:40:26] Is co thing still going on? Who knows? I
[1:40:28] don't know.
[1:40:29] And two people could stay.
[1:40:30] Two people could stay with him. Okay.
[1:40:31] All right. So, we'll take care of that.
[1:40:33] But we'll keep everybody posted. Thank
[1:40:35] you all for coming. God bless you,
[1:40:36] brother Curtis and Sister Dorna for
[1:40:39] coming being with us. Brother David and
[1:40:40] Sister Angela, you just all family, not
[1:40:44] visitors. Never have been, never will
[1:40:46] be.
[1:40:47] We're just all part of the family of
[1:40:49] God. You just come to a different family
[1:40:50] meeting this time than you do when
[1:40:51] you're at your church. So, God bless
[1:40:53] you. We love you with the love of the
[1:40:54] Lord. If you would bow your head,
[1:40:57] remember, pray for Brother Dale.
[1:41:00] He's he's okay, but you just still need
[1:41:02] to pray for him. Pray for a mom. Pray
[1:41:03] for all the different ones. Pray for the
[1:41:05] church. And um I said we'd have a
[1:41:07] meeting, but since Terrence is not here,
[1:41:08] we may meet Wednesday night after
[1:41:10] service just to see how Brother Dale is.
[1:41:13] And I'm praying this is just a temporary
[1:41:14] thing. Um we knew this morning there was
[1:41:18] there was an issue going on. But you
[1:41:19] know what? Like I said before, he didn't
[1:41:23] he come up here.
[1:41:26] This was his post of duty. This is all
[1:41:27] that man knows.
[1:41:30] Sure, he loves his family, but he loves
[1:41:31] y'all as much as he loves us.
[1:41:33] And this is where he loves more than
[1:41:34] anything. being right here behind this
[1:41:37] pull pit
[1:41:38] preaching the word of God like he has
[1:41:39] been doing for 45 years. So just keep
[1:41:42] him in your prayers and uh keep us all
[1:41:44] in your prayers and we'll see you
[1:41:45] Wednesday night. Brother Luis will be
[1:41:46] preaching on the open book
[1:41:50] I guess I he told me to be quiet so I'll
[1:41:52] just be quiet about it. So all minds and
[1:41:54] hearts clear.
[1:41:59] Yes.
[1:42:00] Yep. That's right.
[1:42:02] Yep. Yep. remember sister Dale in prayer
[1:42:05] also and uh we'll give you any updates
[1:42:08] if if there's any that comes. So let's
[1:42:10] bow our heads to heavenly father. We
[1:42:12] pray Lord today that you'll
[1:42:15] Lord number one
[1:42:17] touch our pastor
[1:42:20] and then also the hands of the people
[1:42:23] that are up there. Lord they're only
[1:42:25] doing what the schools and the books
[1:42:27] tell them to do. But we know there's a
[1:42:30] supernatural being there. Also,
[1:42:33] if we could look through
[1:42:36] another dimension, we'd see a white
[1:42:37] light standing over that man
[1:42:41] that you said you gave us, Lord,
[1:42:44] an angel to follow us through our life.
[1:42:49] They may not be the healing angel, but
[1:42:50] that angel's there to take care and to
[1:42:52] lead and guide maybe the doctor's hands,
[1:42:54] but you're the healer, Father. You died
[1:42:56] at Calvary and took the stripes.
[1:42:59] So by your stripes, he's already healed.
[1:43:01] By your stripes, we're all healed, Lord.
[1:43:04] We all need a touch from you. We all got
[1:43:05] little things that are going on in our
[1:43:07] bodies, Lord. Even ones as we get older,
[1:43:10] but Lord, even the young ones. I pray
[1:43:11] that you would be with the ones, Lord,
[1:43:13] that sometimes we overlook the the
[1:43:17] pressures of the day of these young
[1:43:19] adults
[1:43:20] like Kay was so gracious to come and
[1:43:22] testify, Lord, about being in
[1:43:24] depression.
[1:43:25] That's a demon
[1:43:27] and that thing needs to leave.
[1:43:30] Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:30] I know we all have gone through it. Your
[1:43:32] prophet went through it. Different ones,
[1:43:34] Lord.
[1:43:36] But I pray, Lord, that you'll make an
[1:43:38] impression.
[1:43:40] Yes.
[1:43:40] That'll take care of that depression.
[1:43:43] Thank you, Father.
[1:43:43] And Lord, that means that you'll send
[1:43:45] your Holy Spirit, Lord. And when you
[1:43:47] send the Holy Ghost, the devil has to
[1:43:50] flee. Father, forgive us of our sins and
[1:43:52] bless this day. Take care of each one of
[1:43:54] them on the highway. the ones that have
[1:43:55] traveled a long distance. We pray that
[1:43:57] you'd see them safely back home. I know
[1:43:59] some brother Joe never be gone. Brother
[1:44:01] Aaron never be gone next week on
[1:44:03] vacation. We pray that you give them
[1:44:04] traveling mercies that we all come back
[1:44:06] together. Lord in you, Father, give us
[1:44:09] this day our daily bread.
[1:44:12] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:44:14] You're dismissed. God bless you.
[1:44:17] Oh, there's a river of life. Open the
[1:44:21] back door up.
[1:44:23] Makes the lame to walk in the blind.
