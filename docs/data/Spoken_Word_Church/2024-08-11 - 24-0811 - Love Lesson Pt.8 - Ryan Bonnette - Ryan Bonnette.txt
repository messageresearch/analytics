of your word I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you and you be seated and also I'm teaching Sunday school up here this morning uh so we're going to continue on what uh we've been on with the love lessons series so uh just want to say first of all it's such a privilege as we all realize to be considered uh even the opportunity to be the bride of Christ and something we should not take lightly not take for granted um and uh really get a sense of the gravity of that situation it's the best opportunity I believe that's ever been given to mankind so that's what this lesson is all about um we're going to get into I'll summarize the lesson here in a moment but let's Also let's go to the Lord in prayer for just just for this lesson for a moment Heavenly Father pray just help me Lord in teaching uh this lesson that youve put on my heart and I pray it be a blessing to your people here and give them understanding of it I pray and and just help to move out of the way and let and let uh let this be a blessing help to them and their walk with you in Jesus name amen all right so as the scripture says Revelation 19 his wife hath made herself ready so we know there is something for us to do as the bride of Christ I want to give a little word about her about brother Dell um that I didn't get to share yet as as a kind of a little testimony that um we were going to go see him when we found out he was getting bad originally we had decided not to visit him in ICU we don't usually visit people in ICU for so many reasons we're going to wait for him to come home and make him a banana pudding and go visit him at his house well then that evening that we we found out he was so bad that we were going to go the next day when I get up you know to get ready for work I sleep in the afternoon got up about 5 that evening and I was going to check what's at one last time make sure it's clear to go and turned out he went to his reward brother waited posted there and I said Lord you knew that was going to happen and so we didn't get to see him that last time but then that next morning at the chicken farm I always try to look for opportunities to take a picture of the sunrises I see see him every morning I went to the back side of the farm and saw this beautiful sunrise and I thought my my dad's favorite scripture weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning Psalm 30 and I was thinking Brother D that Sunrise you know he'll he'll be back all those who have gone by the way he they'll be back but it's a reminder every morning of the resurrection of Christ and it's just one of the most beautiful sunrises it was just such a consolation to me um and I want to talk a little bit about his life too this is not necessarily part of the lesson but it it'll tie in pretty nice that think uh Proverbs 13 a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children so all all four of my grandparents that passed away a couple of them I got to speak at their funeral just to give a little a few words and I always used this scripture because all of them in one way or another left an inheritance not a penny of money it was an inheritance of a life lived a legacy that they showed me my way to Christ um and both my grandfathers were pastors uh my dad's parents were missionaries in uh East Pakistan my dad sort of grew up there um for a short time in his Elementary years you know and they left such a legacy for me in that way teach me to read the Bible and pray and go to church and um so brother Dale did that he left us an example of a life lived but then all these sermons that we now have of his that are our brothers have so graciously put on the internet even Consolidated them into series that you got the seal Series in ' 82 and the matching pieces in '93 and and gab and I are working we've been working for several years Rel listening to the seals he preached in ' 82 and ' 83 and also starting on the adoption Series where we're going back listening to that and we can just glean over these things these that's an inheritance um and and a legacy that he left to us but that life lived when he was s up here as a revelated person and not bragging but he would tell us these little drop these little hints six books a day two tapes you know he was accused of being a two-year Theologian cuz he studied so much so if I would look at him and I'd say well how didd he get where he's at I want to be where he's at on that revelation ladder and I take that Revelation recipe six books a day two tapes it doesn't have to be exactly that formula you know just meditating on the word of God like he did constantly listening every day and he would say to like his peers you know some people had equal opportunity to come to that level of revelation that came in the message alongside him and years later he sort of left them and they're still preaching God's in a prophet and he's over here preaching the seals and Daniel 7 weeks and he said what have you been doing reading gre's Almanac you know he always made that G's Almanac now it's Facebook or whatever you let get in your way between you and the Lord so don't forget tithe your time just a good rule of thumb at least 2 and a half hours a day and I know that seems like a lot of time but if you space it out 10 minutes of Prayer in the morning 10 minute listen to sermon on the way to work meditate on the word of God if you can while you're at work if your job allows that have your devotional in the evening with your family and by the end of the day you've probably spent 2 and 1/2 hours just a little here and a little there that does tie in with my lesson perfectly cuz my lesson is Daily Bread so love lesson part 8 Our Daily Bread all I'm talking about if you lose me in all these examples this has been my whole life story seeky first the kingdom of God since I was 12 if you lose me in all these need to- GRE examples then I want to summarize it right at the beginning all I'm saying is it seems like a daunting task because the amount of word that's being revealed in our day and you think of all these the Bible is a thick book and all these sermon books that we have available in the seals book and Daniel 7 weeks Church AE book all these thick books and if you're not an Avid Reader which I'm not um then it might seem intimidating but if you just take it a day at a time you're not looking to read the entire Bible in one day just read your daily bread just a little bit here and a little bit there and you've got 365 days a year and that adds up it really does I've been reading my Bible every day since I was 15 and I see down to the scope of time now I see so many things that has blessed me with through that um and brought me here to the message so many other things Gabby and I are an anomaly we shouldn't even be here I mean some of you were raised in the message but we shouldn't be here she was an orphan girl tossed about from Pillar To Post never really had a solid family much less a church family and she prayed all that time God give me a family and he brought her to a message family that wanted to adopt a boy and at this picnic they were meeting these potential kids they could adopt and they took a picture of this boy and they went home and they got the picture developed and it was not the boy it was Gabby and her sister and they said and they were not even in the frame and they said well maybe the Lord wants us to adopt those girls so they did and here sits Gabby today as a testament to that that's predestination everybody said you came a little old seed I didn't have a little old seed in me I had a little old seed of the serpent you know but what I did have is a desire for more of God and God put the word my path that's predestination the word comes predestinated interally from God and it will find its place but he does it through people and through books and through interactions in your life and and churches and pastors and the fold Ministry that he puts in your path knowing what you'll do with it that's predestination am we shouldn't be here I would be in the Baptist Church still um uh Sister Amy y'all some of yall know my testimony that Amy and I Amy Stewart then Silas she and I were both in high school together marching band we dated for a while but one day sister uh sister gwy gave me a church book and said God sent a prophet and I said oh okay and to the seventh Church age I said oh what's the church age I'd already read the Bible by then cover to cover little baptist boy I'd already read it but I didn't read that I didn't understand that so anyway so that's predestination God putting somebody in your path amen so do something for your goals uh brother John durett talks about setting goals and I'm saying that's sort of same thing in this lesson form good habits set goals and then do something toward that goal every day and in this case I'm talking about the mysteries of God and the revelation of the word make that your goal that I want to be part of the Bride I want to understand d 7 weeks I want to understand the seals what are you doing toward that goal read the seal book if it's just a page a day just read it right so it works a lot toward other things in your life too um y'all probably won't be able to see that but I'll read it to you this is out of that Love Dare book that Gabby and I have been reading um love works in all areas the words of the Lord are pure words like silver refined and Earth and furnace purified seven times H sounds like seven Church ages Psalm 12 if being a regular Bible reader is new for you you'll be surprised how quickly you'll begin thinking differently and more eternally as you begin digesting it truth day by day if you are serious about establishing strategies for life based on God's way of doing things he'll guide you to make the connections between what you're reading and how it applies it's an enlightening Journey for uh with fresh discoveries to be made all the time God has a plan for the way you handle your money he has a plan for the way you raise your children he knows how you should treat your body and how you should spend your time he has a plan for the way you handle conflict and a plan for marital success most any issue that you will encounter in life can be taken to the counsil of scripture and illuminated by his perfect wisdom after all God designed life itself that's right isn't it just like your maker to know exactly what you need amen Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom of God you know that scripture um other things in your life as you seek God every day and reading his word other things in life kind of start to fall into place and with your money and your marriage and raising children so as I was saying earlier it's a daunting task I'm going to use that word a lot so daunting means tending to overwhelm or intimidate a daunting Tas to think of all these sermon books and even the Bible itself such a thick book so one of the key points I'm probably going to stress in this lesson is that you don't have to make yourself understand it you do your part and God will do his part on so many things that you that seem Out Of Reach and seem like you can't attain to just do your daily bread amen he'll do his part he'll put somebody in the pull pit I read the Bible don't know how many times and didn't understand most of it but he'd always be faithful to put someone in the pull pit to not only answer my questions but would make it relevant to what I just read that morning how many times have you seen the sermon of the preacher line up with your daily reading or your devotional with your family so possessed in the gate of the enemy uh after trial brother Banner says when the love of God comes comes into the heart and you fall in love with God he reveals himself the Bible meaning the interpretation of the Bible is God himself interpreting his promises for the Bible is written between the lines brother Wade often refers to how do you eat an elephant it's a good analy I don't think anyone here has ever eaten an elephant besides me brother Louis he's the only one I can think of that might try that so if you was to eat an elephant how would you do it there's only one way to eat an elephant right one body at a time that's right Dave Ramsey in his program talks about baby steps you don't try to pay off your whole entire debt when you start that program all at once you just take baby steps pay off the little one first and then the next biggest one and the next one and so on baby steps the invisible Union of the bride of Christ skip on down to the Highlight the word became blood the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God and the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of the prostitutes and be cleans and cleaned and Sanctified by the washing of Water by the word and make sure your mind and heart State on God and on his word am so continue on down also again down to the yellow and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmar Grace a wedding band of Grace unmar of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there he put your name in the book what a Thanksgiving the benefits of daily Bible reading um see James 1 Let's skip on down verse 7 for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord the man that's wavereth okay unstable naturally we are very unstable and uh but a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways ask God for wisdom and understanding revelation of the word as you read it he absolutely will help you understand it if you make an effort we're about just your daily bread make an effort no matter how small reading his word will give you stability both spiritually and in your life choices 1 Corinthians 15 therefore my beloved Brethren Be You Stand Fast unmovable always abounding the work of the Lord for as much as you know your labor is not in vain in the Lord the least little thing you do in private in secret in your prayer closet God sees it and he'll reward you abundantly for it your work is never in vain and Lord this includes your efforts of reading the Bible he sees your effort it teaches you to love how to be patient be a good spouse how to be a good parent how to be content even how to receive Divine Healing it's the answer to all things so spoken word is Original Seed this is one of my favorite quotes stay right with that word stay with that Watch What Happens say Lord I believe it it's in the Holy Spirit then watch then if he goes to bearing record then you'll know you got it not by some sensation the devil's do that not by some miracle the Devils do that but by your constant belief in the word of God and the life that you live never deny nothing say Amen to the word you know as you as you see more unfold you say Amen keep walking into it you might not understand it at first that's irrelevant it's just the M the fact that you you walk into it and when I came to the message I didn't see it I didn't understand it at first and it was really uh I I doubted it at first but you know I didn't have any reason to say it's not right so my job is open that church age book s wi gave me and I took it one page a day for a whole year it took me to read that book The First Time comparing it with my Bible and trying to figure out if brother Brandon was trying to pull the wool over my eyes you know misquote a scripture or something it makes the word becoming flesh see flesh and the same water spirit uh from James 4 submit yourself so to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw n to God He will draw nigh to you cleanse your your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your uh let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up so let's talk about the ant for a few minutes Proverbs 6 go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the Harvest so if we want to talk about somebody being sort of um un equipped I guess you you might say not able to accomplish a whole lot in comparison to like a human you know ants can't get a whole lot of work done um in comparison to US you know so they're they're a very small creature and but they're such diligent workers they just don't stop they keep going and they don't they don't consider whether something's even possible or not they don't look at the how how big the the chasm maybe is they have to cross or whatever they just keep going this never stop so some facts about ants a lot of different species this is just kind of broad okay um on average an ant can travel about 3,000 mi in its lifetime which is typically 1 to three years that's a lot for an ant you think about a daunting task as an ant to go 3,000 miles ants can travel up to four miles in a single day that's pretty intimidating to think of an ant that going going that far in a day moving at a pace of about 3 in per second they're able to travel such distances because they work throughout the day and night including forging for food at night in the spring and summer work your ants can travel up to 100 yards from their nest to find food so consider the ant very diligent worker um so in 2007 which is not the Year this picture was taken it's just a good quick picture I found of our house that was our starter home in 2007 we had a total debt Gabby and I um when we got married we started off with $150,000 of debt close to $100,000 on our house and $50,000 worth of new cars clueless about handling money not a clue around the time Mercy was conceived I said we need a bigger car you everybody thinks you know you're going to have a baby got to have a bigger house and a bigger car all of a sudden cuz like a baby can't fit in a in a small car a baby can't fit in a small house somehow got to have a bigger house bigger car so I was thinking like most people let's go get it some more debt and we already owed money on both their cars cars and I was going to trade one of them in and get even more debt mom and my sister Brooke they said why not consider Dave Ramsey's program so I started listening and I was hooked so we started the program 2009 two years into our marriage we had about $150,000 of debt um and then so this is what that looks like to me okay $150,000 a debt big huge hole like the Grand Canyon and you might think well that's not that much debt Ryan but according to what size our shovel was your shovel in this analogy is your is your is your income we never had a whole lot of income I mean um and it's a fairly modest income it's not 200,000 400,000 a year you know it's very small so um we still lived in that home by say it was 11 years altogether That was supposed to be our starter home we bought that house right before the downturn of the housing market so we were stuck cuz the value of the home dropped in half and it stayed down our area did not recover for about 11 years I don't know know why it took so long to recover but it was about 11 years we had all four of our kids there six people one bathroom two bedrooms in that 800t Matchbox little shoe box and here we are trying to pay off debt and trying to get ahead we sold our cars we paid them off and bought used cars and that helped us Advance quite a bit but we still had that mortgage hanging over our heads so I'm chunking little shovels into this Grand Canyon little $100 bills here and there it feels like it's just going into thin air but like the ant like all my examples I'm giving daunting task if you just make a little every day little bit every day keep chunking keep chunking here we are today mortgage paid off as of two weeks ago paid our last bit of our mortgage and I'll say by the grace of God because the mathematically it was impossible with what I was making having medical bills IA is a debt collector she since she's been born for 10 years bless her heart she's been in out of the hospital and had surgeries and had all kind of medical issues so we've averaged $8 to $10,000 on some years out of pocket um after insurance pays their part and then trying to chunk towards the mortgage and all that it just didn't seem like mathematically it was even possible and it wasn't it was totally impossible but we just kept on our diligent way sacrificing not much eating out at all and very seldom a vacation you know just like brother John said Trisha you sacrifice to win we did our part but then God did his part because people would give us gifts not thousands of dollars just you know little bit here a little bit there and we didn't need it so we chunk it at the mortgage chunk it at the mortgage chunk it at the mortgage uh we still have a little bit of medical debt so we're not technically debt free but we're mortgage free as of a couple weeks ago so thank the Lord for that and that's our house where we currently live our double double wide which is double the size of our last house pretty much double everything that we had so to me I let me read this scripture then I'll get on to that other example God calls Cyrus Isaiah 45 thus sayith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of Kings to open before him the two Le Gates and the gates shall not be shut I will go before thee and make the Crooked places straight I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in under the bars of iron and I will give Thee the treasures of Darkness think of about the mysteries of the kingdom of God um the Revelation that's been made available to us he'll give us that and hidden Riches of secret places and that thou mayest know that I the Lord which call thee by name am the god of Israel amen I didn't feel like some kind of champion when we paid off our mortgage I cried and I thought Lord we're like the Special Olympics I I got to see these some of the children in the Special Olympics several years ago and it really really uh inspired me how they put so much effort and and everybody knows they're incapable of maybe competing against you know fairly you know more athletic kid normal kid or whatever but yet they give it their all and they try their best and everybody just cheers for them cuz like like they did something you know and that's how I felt at the end of that that I gave my best but God did what I couldn't do you know um and sort of like Ruth uh in the story in BO Ruth chapter 2 and Boaz said unto her at M time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers and reached her he reached her parch corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaths and reproach her not and let fall some of the handfuls of purpose think about Revelation amen of these Mysteries and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not and she brought home I think it was um an epha of barley which is 30 lb is quite a bit for a little Ru to carry 30 lb or 6 gallons so my point is there that God makes up for our shortcomings like Ruth she was just doing her best to reap but they were leaving her these handfuls of purpose along the way something that she couldn't do in herself taunting tasks $1.2 million that's a lot of money to make I've made roughly 1.2 million at fiale but that's been over 23 years so how do you make $1.2 million at a time started off there seven bucks an hour that was a big pay raise from Derry spot making five bucks an hour but it's just been a dollar at a time never made $1,000 at a time never made 10,000 at a time I've driven 1.2 million miles that's a daunting task seems like a lot of miles I never drove a th000 at a time never drove 10,000 at a time I drive one mile at a time which is 50 trips around the Earth 2 and a half trips to the Moon that's what it looks like driving is incredibly boring no no matter what you do is incredibly boring there's no denying it so that's striving the one thing fun I wear a seat belt by the way this was at a stop I was at a farm so I just love my job just because I get to spend time of the Lord but it's incredibly boring but anyway one mile at a time is how you drive 1.2 million miles y'all are familiar with this I I'm going to have to close but um brother Dell's quoted this over the years many times SC Field's notes Here a mystery in Scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but in which the supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation and y'all can look at that list and I say almost everybody in here knows something about some of those things because the word that's been made revealed to you and just take that to heart and and thank God for the word that's been revealed and just keep going CU in all these Mysteries there's more to be revealed yes brother Dell uh our musicians if you'll start making your way up here please this is Brother Dale from about 5 years ago uh 2019 September 15th on salvation same material if you can get to that point to understand what faith really is then it'll be easy to be able to say add virtue because it's the same material all right it's not a different material it's the same material added to it virtue the knowledge will be the same material Temperance patience godliness it'll all be the same material so you're not having to try to figure out if you'll just ever find out what faith really is and get that in your understanding then you'll see that what these virtues really are it's just adding Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith Revelation to Revelation Daily Bread here a little there a little opening of God's word to each one of us brother bam gives an example about an arcade uh in Jehovah J number one when I got filled with the Holy Ghost if you people did uh like you people did I like to walk through and like a big arcade everything there belongs to me I'm air of every bit of it I like to find out what I got become a become a Christian I want to know what I own if I had an arcade I go through pull out a drawer and see what's in here and look over here see what's in there something seemed a bit too high for me I'd get me a step ladder and climb up to it I find out what it was something seems a little beyond my reach I get on my knees and start praying till I Rise up to it it belongs to me God promised it right Divine Healing the power of God brother Wade and others have been talking about power of God and all these materials or miracles signs and wonders he promised it so again knocking will be opened seek and you shall find oh yeah number of chickens hauled 65 million chickens that's a lot of chickens for one little guy to haul by myself we don't do team drivers that's me 65 million so think about the tortoise in the hair I like that example because if you've read the story of The Tortoise and the hair they were in race and uh the tortoise was not adequate to win that in his own power but because of the pride of that hair the Taurus being in persever and just keeping on keeping on his Daily Bread he finally won that race so be the tortoise don't be the hair God bless you thank you amen
