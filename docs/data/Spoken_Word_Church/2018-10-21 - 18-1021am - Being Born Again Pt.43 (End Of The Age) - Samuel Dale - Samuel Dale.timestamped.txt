[13:54] all in Jesus name so we're going to
[13:58] first Peter 1 22 23 then we're going to
[14:04] the Leviticus we're going to try to pick
[14:07] up a little point to review especially
[14:10] this past Wednesday's message make sure
[14:13] you understand where we're we're you
[14:16] know what we're trying to bring alright
[14:18] so we appreciate it maybe in another
[14:21] week or two we'll get off of this
[14:23] message I said I was gonna try to finish
[14:25] up the message today but I won't be able
[14:26] to it'll be for a while
[14:29] and brother Forney be with us Wednesday
[14:31] so just pray for him
[14:34] verse 22 seeing you purified your souls
[14:37] and obeying the truth through the spirit
[14:39] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[14:42] that you love one another with a pure
[14:43] heart fervently being born again not of
[14:46] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[14:50] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[14:53] for ever
[14:55] amen now you remember our point this
[14:58] past Wednesday as you're turning to
[15:01] Leviticus we we're talking about the new
[15:05] birth the new birth has always been ever
[15:08] aged every time the new birth is the
[15:12] birth of the word and if not explain
[15:15] something to me tell me what the new
[15:17] birth is well I just believe God well
[15:21] he's the word without the alive word
[15:26] without the Holy Ghost you can have the
[15:28] letter in your heart all of your days
[15:30] your life and still die and go to hell
[15:31] because you're missing it but with the
[15:33] revelation of that word
[15:35] you cannot die all right so what is the
[15:38] new birth it's the birth of the word
[15:40] okay we hit it Wednesday we'll get back
[15:44] to it the Lord willing in another week
[15:46] or something what is the headstone if
[15:50] the cornerstone is the new birth and
[15:53] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[15:55] personally to you then would not the
[15:59] headstone be the revelation of the word
[16:03] that would be sewn into the last days
[16:06] right because see the cornerstone and
[16:10] the headstone can't be different because
[16:13] the headstone actually become the
[16:15] cornerstone of the church and it comes
[16:19] through the church ages as the
[16:21] cornerstone Jesus Christ be in that
[16:24] cornerstone all right and then comes out
[16:27] to be the headstone so it'd be more the
[16:29] revelation of Jesus Christ that's what I
[16:31] thought we believe you know okay we'll
[16:34] get to that in a minute now we go to
[16:35] Leviticus 25 verse 8 that's out number
[16:42] seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven
[16:47] times seven years in the space of the
[16:50] seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto
[16:52] thee forty and nine years now that
[16:57] represents the church ages the seven
[17:01] church ages alright now listen it is in
[17:05] the seventh church age that the rapture
[17:07] comes
[17:09] but you cannot stay under a seven and
[17:13] think about eternity right as long as
[17:20] you're dealing with a seven you're in
[17:22] time okay so now read what we're talking
[17:27] about that's number seven sabbaths of
[17:30] years remember there's a jubilee over
[17:33] seven years remember they don't jubilee
[17:35] ever in other words you work six days
[17:38] rested the seventh all of that was tied
[17:40] into it now look and that's number seven
[17:44] Sabbath's of years into these seven
[17:45] times seven years and that's in the
[17:49] space of the seven Sabbath's of years
[17:50] shall be unto thee forty and nine years
[17:53] okay know what then shall cause the
[17:56] trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the
[17:58] tenth day of the seventh month in the
[18:01] day of atonement so you make the trumpet
[18:03] sound throughout all your land
[18:07] alright a trumpet has to come under the
[18:10] seven to proclaim the eighth alright
[18:16] keep that in mind as we go along now
[18:18] watch verse 10 so you know you've done
[18:22] seven sevens it's 49
[18:23] okay a jubilee a release every seven
[18:28] years now watch and ye shall hallow the
[18:31] fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty
[18:34] throughout all the land unto the
[18:36] inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[18:38] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[18:41] every man unto his possession and you
[18:43] shall return every man unto his family
[18:47] you may be seated the Lord that is
[18:49] blessing to the reading of the word now
[18:53] the said we tried to we've been trying
[18:58] for quite a while to get things in the
[19:02] right line up for us to understand where
[19:05] we're at and what's taking place and the
[19:09] day in the hour that we're living and to
[19:13] recognize your day and it's message all
[19:18] right now to recognize your
[19:24] and it's message we should know that
[19:28] we're in the end of all things that
[19:31] should be the natural but worse the
[19:33] message the how is it that we talk about
[19:37] Wednesday night that you find out
[19:39] whether a man is true or not what's the
[19:43] message that follows we don't throw off
[19:46] on anybody we don't make no light of
[19:49] anybody or what but CEO Roberts Billy
[19:51] Graham wonderful they were the two
[19:55] sodomite messengers that will in time
[19:57] that went down to Sodom and come out all
[20:00] right they were great they done their
[20:03] work okay thank God for it
[20:06] but were was either one of them that had
[20:08] a message oh you can get some books and
[20:13] things out on Billy Graham and what he
[20:15] taught on this you can get some books
[20:17] out on the old Roberts and what he
[20:18] taught on this that of the other all
[20:20] right but worse the message that they
[20:24] brought and remember the quote we gave
[20:27] you that brother branham said it don't
[20:30] matter if you have signs and wonders but
[20:33] if you continue with the same old
[20:35] message he said don't fool with it even
[20:44] though you have signs and wonders but
[20:47] you continue with the same old message
[20:49] what would it be today for us to want to
[20:52] sat down and listen to a message on the
[20:55] Trinity you know you know what I mean
[20:57] someone trying to prove the Trinity Rock
[20:59] we yet having signs and wonders very
[21:04] deceptive but you're out of the world
[21:08] see because there's got to be forever
[21:11] age and time there's got to be a message
[21:15] come forth
[21:17] all right we've been driving at that for
[21:19] a long time trying to get you to follow
[21:22] the thought because knowing we were
[21:25] headed toward this form here to try to
[21:28] express you know the things all right in
[21:33] the Bible
[21:35] you had a Jubilee over seven years most
[21:38] people don't realize that they only go
[21:40] to the 49 and up to the 50 okay all
[21:43] right but you got to release and be glad
[21:45] to go through the Scriptures matter of
[21:46] fact if you'll back up in verse 25
[21:50] you'll find it's dealing with the sevens
[21:53] all right
[21:54] that's why you have your seventh-day
[21:57] Adventist people who claimed the Sabbath
[22:01] or the baptism of the whole to go is to
[22:04] keep the Saturday or the seventh day
[22:06] alright see you had a release there in
[22:10] the Bible every seven years and it would
[22:15] go seven sevens is 49 and then it would
[22:18] come to a 50th Jubilee time all right so
[22:24] there's a release in each church age
[22:26] these church age has a release there was
[22:31] there was a Salvation to each age of
[22:34] people but if you'll go back now I'm
[22:36] giving you this where you think about it
[22:38] and you see what I'm driving out when
[22:42] you're studying that and you look at the
[22:44] Jubilee on the seventh or the release
[22:48] ever seven years if you'll read your
[22:51] Bible and I'll be glad to show you these
[22:53] things they were stipulations went as
[22:57] long as you were dealing with a seven
[23:00] and as long as you and I are dealing
[23:03] with a seven we're still hooked in time
[23:08] now we're not talking about an eighth
[23:11] day this or that or the other of the old
[23:13] doctrine back in about two seventy one
[23:15] two or three four
[23:16] I wish stood that just as much as we're
[23:19] standing it today but there's one thing
[23:22] for sure they talk then we were already
[23:24] in the eighth day we've done Pais to
[23:26] millennium we've done PI we've done done
[23:29] in today today I said no it looks like
[23:31] we're dying you know look like we've got
[23:33] a lot of problems so we can't be in that
[23:35] all right and see trying to get the
[23:38] point to the people to see what the
[23:41] truth was about it okay all right but by
[23:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your
[23:48] soul
[23:48] your soul is eternal as it'll ever be
[23:52] which means it's already your soul and I
[23:55] told them then your soul quoting brother
[23:58] Branham has already entered into the
[24:01] eighth day spiritually not eight they
[24:04] physically we're still physically we're
[24:07] dying as long as we're dying we're still
[24:11] under a seven but by the new birth that
[24:14] you receive your soul is eternal which
[24:18] is already into the eighth day
[24:20] spiritually not physically now so gonna
[24:24] be silly
[24:25] listen all right and see as long as
[24:29] we're under time we're hooked to it okay
[24:34] it doesn't matter what you want to think
[24:36] about this so in each church AJ was a
[24:39] release every seven years there was a
[24:43] release every seven years if you were in
[24:46] bondage all right
[24:48] now we won't go through all of that if
[24:50] you'd be glad to go with it but see it's
[24:52] not slavery that's what everybody thinks
[24:54] they dealing with slavery it's not
[24:57] slavery in the Bible they ain't even
[24:59] talking about slavery
[25:01] it's when a Hebrew buys a Hebrew it's
[25:08] not slavery you can't use the natural
[25:11] type of slavery in thing it doesn't work
[25:14] because see even the children of Israel
[25:18] had slaves right you know Oh Hagar was a
[25:27] slave about person see you don't go with
[25:34] slavery that's what we want to get we
[25:36] don't get in their type this stuff and
[25:37] don't go with it it's when a Hebrew buys
[25:40] a Hebrew it's when I oh brother Lewis
[25:45] money and I can't pay it and I go in
[25:48] bondage to him and work for him long
[25:50] enough to pay that debt and at the end
[25:54] of that seven years that it was there in
[25:56] the Old Testament then they become a
[25:58] release I could go home but you don't
[26:00] read you Bible read
[26:02] your Bible when a person let another one
[26:07] go free like that they didn't send them
[26:09] home empty-handed
[26:10] read your Bible that's wonderful you
[26:14] gave them provisions and things to help
[26:17] them to get started again cause it all
[26:20] was speaking of eternal life all right
[26:24] so there was a release every 7 years but
[26:27] you went to 77249 and then you turn
[26:29] around started right back over what
[26:33] because it couldn't come to a jubilee of
[26:35] a 50 all right his wave was bringing out
[26:39] another there's no record that Israel
[26:41] ever did you know never did hold that
[26:45] 50th why cause it wasn't gonna let them
[26:48] people go free that's just plain
[26:50] language they held it all right but see
[26:54] you go and if you'll notice in your
[26:56] riding in the scripture under those
[26:59] sevens if a man went into bondage now
[27:05] going to bondage brother Louise to pay
[27:08] my debt if I take my wife and go in with
[27:12] her and sell out to him when I get to my
[27:15] times up I go free my wife goes free
[27:18] but if the master give you a wife she
[27:24] can't go free her and her offspring
[27:27] would stay under the master see the
[27:30] stipulations they can't be no rapture in
[27:33] the Church ages we got to get to a
[27:35] number 8 to find a rapture the main
[27:39] thing I want to write I want to find
[27:41] because see that says as we read here
[27:43] now the Jubilee will sound on the 49th
[27:51] to declare the coming 50 it's another
[27:59] Irish word it's what people can't follow
[28:02] and I've tried my best to explain if I
[28:04] need to go over that let me know I'll be
[28:06] glad to try to cover it what you see
[28:09] under that 49
[28:12] but went into bundage with my wife she
[28:15] come on you gave me a wife my wife
[28:17] stayed they stipulations they kept was
[28:20] tied to time there's been stipulations
[28:22] in the church ages there's no change of
[28:24] the body in any church age right so now
[28:31] how we're gonna get to that place where
[28:32] they can be a change and worse the
[28:35] messenger and the message that goes with
[28:40] that
[28:41] that's all I've tried to do is get to
[28:43] see the man because you see under the 49
[28:45] you had stipulation
[28:47] but now reading the tenth verse over
[28:49] again when it comes to the fiftieth
[28:53] everything goes free you can't keep it
[29:00] in matter if I went into bondage and he
[29:01] gave me a wild all that goes free under
[29:04] a 50 there's no limitations under the 50
[29:08] because that's the type of the baptism
[29:11] of the Holy Ghost that's why it says in
[29:14] the Bible when the day of Pentecost was
[29:17] fully come see that come to a fifty not
[29:23] a forty nine long as we're in time we're
[29:27] hooked we've got to find out how to get
[29:30] from time to eternity all right then we
[29:34] got to find the messenger to get us from
[29:36] time to eternity then we got to find his
[29:39] message to get us some time to eternity
[29:43] all right are you looking for another
[29:45] messenger who's the messenger to come to
[29:49] declare that you believe are you looking
[29:53] for another prophet to come okay we've
[29:57] got that song heaven there's no profit
[29:59] to come I hope you're not blinded to
[30:02] that of what I've just said not looking
[30:06] for another messenger okay we believe
[30:11] the messenger has already come to
[30:13] proclaim as we covered our Wednesday
[30:16] night this is the introducing of the
[30:19] headstone the prophets it will review
[30:21] these in a minute
[30:23] but now worse the message what's the
[30:28] message of eternal life
[30:31] well we're just born to get believe
[30:33] we're ready to go you know you're just
[30:34] like a Pentecostal you shopping without
[30:37] the horns and forgetting the whole
[30:38] message what's the message what is the
[30:41] message of us trying to bring out there
[30:43] Winston what is it in the Bible that
[30:47] light had never shined upon what was it
[30:53] during the Scriptures it was lighted
[30:55] never said like I told you if you listen
[30:57] to Wade what are you talking about the
[31:01] son of man Matthew Mark Luke and John
[31:05] yes they wrote of the son of man they
[31:08] told of the Son of Man but show me
[31:10] anything Paul and Peter them ever wrote
[31:12] about it in their messages after them
[31:16] they never wrote of the Son of Man
[31:18] because they didn't understand it even
[31:21] Peter when he said when Jesus said who
[31:24] demands don't watch it when Pete when
[31:26] Jesus said to Peter who the man say i
[31:29] the son of man am right what is that
[31:35] Matthew ok wait don't read his name we
[31:40] don't plan these things ok all right who
[31:49] the man say either son of man look what
[31:50] Peter said Peter said dark the Christ
[31:52] the Son of the Living God Jesus didn't
[31:58] ask him who the son of the Living God
[32:00] was he asked him who the son of man was
[32:03] in other words implying the language
[32:06] jesus said to Peter when he said that's
[32:08] the one they say he said ok Peter you're
[32:12] in the lineup you're in the word but
[32:14] said you didn't get what I asked
[32:16] I asked who's the son of man you
[32:19] answered who the son of God is and said
[32:21] I'll build my church up on that son of
[32:23] God
[32:27] remember he died son of man right
[32:31] heroes son of God under their Pentecost
[32:34] into the church son of God is about
[32:37] give some of the Holy Ghost and Jesus
[32:39] said I'll build my church on that we
[32:42] said I'm coming back in the end time and
[32:43] I'll bring the rest of it to you don't
[32:45] worry about it what was it that mankind
[32:48] knew nothing of the sort of man like
[32:55] I've told you sure we talked about it in
[32:56] the Baptist Church
[32:57] son of man has always been resurrection
[33:03] jesus said I am the resurrection it's
[33:07] always been the resurrection all right
[33:09] now but being that see where is that
[33:13] resurrection there's got to be a message
[33:21] all right we'll get back to this here in
[33:24] a minute if we can back in Leviticus
[33:26] cause brother Branham was the one that
[33:28] said it on the daniel seventy weeks he
[33:31] said in 1977 would be the 70s you
[33:34] believe from according to Leviticus 25
[33:37] eight
[33:40] he said making exactly thirty four
[33:42] hundred thirty years he knew exactly to
[33:44] the year he knew exactly did the time
[33:46] all right
[33:48] so worth the message where was it we
[33:51] were trying to talk about wins t I mean
[33:54] you have Sunday excuse me every
[33:56] Wednesday here I get my days Wednesday
[33:58] all right what was it in the Bible at
[34:02] lighted nut shondo the seals of Matthew
[34:05] 24 Peter Paul
[34:09] none of them preached anything about the
[34:11] seals show me in the Bible come on they
[34:16] never preached anything about the seven
[34:18] seals Jesus preached those seals
[34:21] enlighted not shined on that until the
[34:24] end time all right so now then what have
[34:29] we been covering what are we trying to
[34:31] get across the prophet and his ministry
[34:36] and what he come to do had to come in
[34:38] two phases or stages are you listening
[34:42] two phases or two stages every one you
[34:45] want to call it stage one 327 Church age
[34:49] book this message of Malachi for Luke 17
[34:52] will burn will will turn the hearts of
[34:55] the father's back to the children right
[35:00] phase one
[35:02] he said the messengers gonna do two
[35:04] things 1 turn the hearts of the children
[35:05] by he said to reveal the seven thunders
[35:08] which is a revelation contained in the
[35:11] seven seals
[35:11] so what his brother Browns message it
[35:16] was not to fight to the fathers that was
[35:18] restoration to be returned
[35:20] what is brother ins message the opening
[35:24] of the seven seals and the message from
[35:26] their own out come on listen to what I'm
[35:29] saying if you can see it and open up the
[35:32] Bible to where to be a beautiful picture
[35:34] little Ron's messaged acquired in the
[35:37] forty nine the messenger in Leviticus
[35:40] comes in two forty-nine to declare the
[35:42] Jubilee the next year
[35:46] brother Branham come to declare and turn
[35:49] our hearts back to the faith of the
[35:50] fathers Amen
[35:53] that was what he had to do he had to
[35:55] preach us back to the faith of the
[35:56] Father but there on the Ohio River
[36:00] it didn't say your message is to turn
[36:03] the hearts of the children but that's
[36:04] melikhaya for look at the two parts
[36:07] right around got a cover of Malachi 4
[36:09] then he's got to cover revelation 10 7
[36:14] right he's got to turn the hearts of the
[36:18] children back then he's got to bring the
[36:20] message of the opening of the seven
[36:24] seals he said well what does that mean
[36:27] to me where is your messenger to take
[36:30] you to eternal life
[36:34] that's all I've asked that's all I'm
[36:37] asking you where's the message and the
[36:39] messenger to take us to eternal life if
[36:43] it's not already sounded then we've got
[36:46] to find it somewhere somebody's got to
[36:49] come forward with it right well I'm not
[36:53] looking for somebody to come forward
[36:55] with it I've never done that since I
[36:58] walked into this message I saw what he
[37:01] was coming to proclaim he had a message
[37:06] this man stood with a message here I've
[37:10] asked you to look at the titles of the
[37:13] sermons after this the seals was
[37:15] preached this look at the titles of the
[37:18] sermon everything after the seals broke
[37:21] went into eternal life the ones that
[37:26] matter to me that's what I'm saying you
[37:29] losing your you're losing the very
[37:31] salvation that the prophets message
[37:34] brings by being so sarcastic and
[37:38] includes me of being sarcastic or
[37:40] hateful or arrogant or intelligent or
[37:42] this out of the other when I've always
[37:45] tried to explain one time eternal life
[37:52] they had to be a messenger of eternal
[37:54] life Jesus Christ had to come and bring
[37:57] the message of eternal life right each
[38:01] church age had a messenger with a
[38:03] special message of eternal life
[38:05] for that age look at Martin Luther he
[38:10] was already a convert of a Christianity
[38:13] you'd call it he was a what a monk or
[38:15] what you call him a no guy in the ranks
[38:18] and all and what but one day
[38:22] what's eternity strike a man a man is
[38:26] dealing when crying out and trying to
[38:28] repent and trying to to do the penances
[38:31] and do the things of the Catholic Church
[38:33] and all of this over and over and over
[38:35] trying to say this self and God struck
[38:39] her into his heart and said the just
[38:41] shall live by faith that took Martin
[38:45] Luther to eternal life in his soul but
[38:49] he couldn't take him fleshly because it
[38:50] was not a danger time but he took his
[38:53] soul to eternal life John Wesley come
[38:55] along with a message of sanctification
[38:58] that message took his soul into eternal
[39:01] life the Pentecostals come with the
[39:03] restoration of the gifts and people of
[39:07] this message life and make fun of it big
[39:10] names will say oh then Pentecost was all
[39:12] false I challenge that on the basis of
[39:15] God's Word you show me anything false in
[39:17] the Bible come on church it's time to
[39:23] settle down and think about what we're
[39:24] doing what was brother branham's message
[39:34] he had to do the work of restoration
[39:36] back right because we've got so far away
[39:39] from the truth of it until that melech
[39:42] ha part had to be full filled but that
[39:45] was part one to turn the hearts of the
[39:47] children back now words the revelation
[39:51] 10 7 that in the days of the voice of
[39:55] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[39:56] sound the mystery of God shall be
[39:59] revealed where's the mystery the mystery
[40:06] is this message brought by the Prophet
[40:13] in Malachi there was a lot of mysteries
[40:16] come on there was a lot of mysteries the
[40:21] mixture of one God that mr. water
[40:23] baptism the mystery of the thing little
[40:25] running brings them out and shows him
[40:27] those mysteries was there but it was
[40:30] under the faith of the fathers but worse
[40:37] the mysteries that ISKCON the boring
[40:39] mystery that is to contain all mysteries
[40:42] all right are you following me so what
[40:46] happened see the whole key and the
[40:51] things is what I was trying to get
[40:53] across means me not finishing it up at
[40:56] the end I know I spend so much time
[40:57] trying to clarify something to you until
[41:01] a lot of times I don't have a point the
[41:02] time to get what I wanted to bring and
[41:09] then I try to bring out selling people
[41:11] well I fixed the intellect well how it
[41:17] wanted your profit bringing this in let
[41:20] we get to it in a minute What did he say
[41:22] because what I'm trying to get now watch
[41:24] part 1 turn the hearts of the children
[41:27] back when brother Branham went beyond
[41:31] the curtain of time what did he say he
[41:33] said will Paul be judged for what he
[41:35] preached they said yes or ever the angel
[41:40] said yes and those brother Brian said
[41:42] and I preached just what Paul preached
[41:44] and all of those are hollered out and
[41:46] we're resting upon it 1962 reads spoken
[41:52] word is the original seed read it or
[41:54] listen to it you call me an intellect
[41:59] you called me of this or that you say
[42:01] well your teacher then get me underneath
[42:02] well do what your teacher says I got
[42:07] tired of hearing 1 plus 1 equal to
[42:11] didn't you
[42:14] finally I got the two plus two equals
[42:17] four hey I'm doing pretty good and then
[42:23] I really got smart when you get on up
[42:25] into the hundreds and the thing cuz we
[42:27] begin to understand and we used to do a
[42:32] little thing in school goodness you know
[42:34] six seven eight years old
[42:35] I know y'all didn't do it because y'all
[42:38] wouldn't that dumb we used to do a
[42:40] little thing in school and that was to
[42:42] see who could count the fastest or
[42:44] multiply the best right and we go
[42:51] through you know two plus two equal four
[42:52] four four four
[42:53] Hey thank you twenty four is always
[42:56] going on who could count to the hundred
[42:58] two quickest well you know I found out
[43:01] one day how to count to 100 before the
[43:03] rest of them did of course they didn't
[43:05] like it cuz they thought I was a smart
[43:07] aleck right you say well ok now let's
[43:11] that's right now let's count to a
[43:13] hundred
[43:13] ok you start I'm gonna give you a head
[43:15] start go ahead and count to a hundred I
[43:17] mean okay you got ninety one foot hey he
[43:21] shortcutting know what you can do it
[43:24] just say pot of peas did you hear me pot
[43:31] of peas it means in the pot over a
[43:35] hundred well even though he could count
[43:37] 99 plus one and that was smarter than
[43:39] the rest I will do it I come up with a
[43:41] pot of these then just cut the whole
[43:44] thing out do you understand I'm trying
[43:48] to illustrate the answer is in the
[43:53] message and the message has already been
[43:59] brought
[44:00] but it's so simple we're not looking for
[44:06] another messenger to come no cuz we've
[44:11] already had the seventh church age
[44:13] messenger
[44:16] he's already brought his message and
[44:19] like I told you go out through the
[44:22] fields and just read the titles of the
[44:24] sermons

[44:47] Christ a mystery you remember what he
[44:49] said now listen he said if you have any
[44:52] questions on the seals and things where
[44:54] these they go you ain't listening to the
[44:58] message go back to seal Buckley read it
[45:00] he didn't say that he said go to Christ
[45:03] a mystery read it he said go to Christ
[45:08] the mystery why because in Christ the
[45:11] mystery was a whole entire thing
[45:14] come on Church it's just it's time to
[45:17] quit playing with our silly little
[45:19] things and and listen to the word the
[45:26] Prophet said to ever messenger come at
[45:28] the end of the age where do you think
[45:37] he'd come
[45:39] where did Paul come where did iranians
[45:43] where do these come at the prophet said
[45:49] it comes the end of the age well I've
[45:52] been Paul's met Paul comes in late in
[45:54] the age he come right up here and when
[45:58] he got right here and witnessed a minute
[46:01] now if Paul come up here then he's
[46:05] bringing the message to some earner
[46:10] see what I said and you don't listen
[46:18] Paul came at the end of the age into
[46:21] what age we read it to you Wednesday
[46:28] well what's that got to do it
[46:30] where does your messenger come because
[46:32] remember your messenger has to call you
[46:35] forth into the message of the age if
[46:39] you're not called forth into the message
[46:41] of the age you're in bad shape
[46:42] now let me tell it to you like this no
[46:44] church age was ever in time the age is
[46:52] there but he turn life is in every
[46:58] church age if the Holy Ghost in every
[47:01] age listen what about it
[47:11] where is your messenger at that you've
[47:15] got to be called unto now is that the
[47:17] scripture verse number nine preach here
[47:21] 1971 I read the scripture going beyond
[47:25] man's camp and the scripture says go
[47:29] unto him you realize you bet you've got
[47:33] to be called out of an age to be the
[47:35] bride if you're the bride's you're
[47:38] called out of the age physically
[47:40] speaking we're still in the age right
[47:42] we're in Lady ousia
[47:44] right but spiritually speaking by the
[47:46] baptism of the Holy go your soul is just
[47:48] as eternal if that ever be and you've
[47:50] already been called out of the age go
[47:52] out unto him that's what the scripture
[47:56] says called out of the age into eternal
[48:03] life sitting in heavenly places in
[48:06] Christ Jesus but we're still here see
[48:10] that's what you this that's all you get
[48:13] we're doing here
[48:16] we're going to be here until the rapture
[48:19] change the moment or not twinkling eye
[48:22] right
[48:24] but we got to be called out of the age
[48:27] how can you be called out via ijen to be
[48:29] in the age oh that's right again we
[48:31] called out your being an ignorant
[48:32] oh so you burr you birdbrain runs around
[48:36] and around trying to figure things out I
[48:39] know you got to do is just ask God was
[48:46] he in the age physically yeah he was in
[48:50] time which spiritually he was the god of
[48:53] glory right physically he aged
[48:59] spiritually he could not age right so
[49:06] what about it one things days we're
[49:08] gonna get it it's gonna strike us see
[49:12] the messenger comes at the end of the
[49:15] age now if Paul what message I've got
[49:20] him wrote down there so if you want him
[49:21] what age was Paul to be the messenger of
[49:24] I mean I got brother branham's word okay
[49:27] we can look at the pyramid we can see we
[49:29] can talk but what age was Paul to be the
[49:32] messenger of the church in Ephesus right
[49:36] now how could he come at the end of
[49:38] Ephesus and bring the message to Ephesus
[49:45] he bring the message to Smyrna right so
[49:51] then get away from looking at things and
[49:53] can't figure it out take what God says
[49:57] the Prophet emphasized over and over
[49:59] through the church age series that the
[50:01] messenger coming to the end of the age
[50:02] in an overlap between these church age
[50:09] and an overlap run that into your
[50:12] computer some down you get home an
[50:15] overlap between their ages that's what
[50:18] made it work
[50:23] cause listen Jesus said the porter you
[50:33] remember that in the Gospels the porter
[50:37] stands in the door and calls the door
[50:41] ain't going to open let's that porters
[50:43] to him during cold snoring the porter
[50:48] called in the sheep ear who was the
[50:53] porter sure he was typing into the Lord
[50:58] Jesus Christ his own ministry right but
[51:00] who's the porter for each church age the
[51:03] messenger of that age
[51:06] that was what was wrong see the people
[51:09] thought intellectually that Luther was
[51:13] preaching to destroy the Catholic Church
[51:15] and if what they tried to do no making
[51:18] region history illegal I mean they burnt
[51:20] down churches they don't every time I
[51:23] think Luther said that's not right
[51:25] say well you told us to get out and get
[51:27] away from him he said yeah but that's
[51:29] not right
[51:30] I don't do any good to burn the church
[51:33] is to get rid of them things that's
[51:35] inside of you they burnt building
[51:41] thinking that was what Martin Luther
[51:42] talked now he talked of just shall live
[51:46] by faith he taught the new birth to come
[51:50] into the heart of mankind to set that
[51:52] man free you never taught burning the
[51:58] churches and doing this out of the other
[52:01] there's people in this nation especially
[52:03] back in the old days of the seventies in
[52:05] time why they they go by church they
[52:07] just ain't going in that place you go
[52:11] didn't I ah I've got two old spirits in
[52:16] there and although spirit was in the
[52:18] person who say at night that's what
[52:21] always made me unpopular okay
[52:23] still I am so I don't worry about it oh
[52:25] there's the truth what am i concerned
[52:28] about the buildings you know this used
[52:31] to be an old store
[52:35] well they are there amongst over got any
[52:39] more bad spirits in them well you've
[52:41] been sitting in an old store building
[52:43] for a long time how many bad spirits
[52:47] have you got out of yes okay but listen
[52:53] Church the messenger always came I was
[53:00] trying to explain it to you Wednesday
[53:01] night he always came at the end of the
[53:03] age okay now explain to me where your
[53:13] messenger is and who he is and what's to
[53:17] take place under that form of line or
[53:22] thought of the messenger come at the end
[53:24] of the age
[53:25] did Paul come at the end of Ephesus or
[53:28] the beginning which one well what that
[53:35] matter to me if he came to the end of
[53:37] the age look what you got one two three
[53:39] four five six seven but if he becomes
[53:47] down here and brings it correctly you've
[53:49] got one two three five six seven eight
[53:53] hey hey the number eight we were using
[53:57] well ago the number eight signifies
[54:00] eternity right that's Leviticus number
[54:06] eight signifies eternity Paul coming to
[54:10] end of Ephesus then he would bring in
[54:14] the message to Simona
[54:21] what you see you won't listen to
[54:23] somebody preaching and then when I read
[54:26] it you've already got your mind so shut
[54:28] off until you won't listen to what even
[54:30] the Prophet says Paul came at the end of
[54:34] Pentecost and brought the message to
[54:40] Ephesus as the age began to dwindle
[54:49] Iranians came at the end of that Ephesus
[54:54] age and brought the message to the
[54:58] Samoan age now if I get them majors
[55:01] wrong in the nines wrong you put them
[55:02] right okay you see he brought the
[55:09] message of eternal life these messenger
[55:13] brings the message of eternal life now
[55:16] remember what a messenger does what a
[55:18] porter does he opens the door unless he
[55:25] come in Paul rebuked not to church at
[55:33] Ephesus Paul rebuked the Pentecostals
[55:38] from getting away from the book of Acts
[55:40] now we're going to read the prophet when
[55:43] I'm gonna preach it to you then to see
[55:44] if you can believe it without the rip
[55:46] prophet saying it with plain common
[55:49] sense if you'd watch the story unfold
[55:52] Paul came rebuking those that was before
[55:56] him are dire in the church ages I mean
[55:59] not even in the church a the first
[56:01] church age is Ephesus then is that age
[56:03] dwindle down Iranians came at the end of
[56:06] the church the end of that Church of
[56:10] Ephesus you've got a man standing
[56:13] Iranians Martin Columba Luther Wesley
[56:16] Elijah look where Elijah if you're gonna
[56:20] put him you got him way down here
[56:25] you know how are you gonna get that
[56:28] messenger in the right place if he don't
[56:32] fall in the right place you don't have
[56:34] no message you'll see what I've been
[56:37] preaching for 40-something years this
[56:41] message was to to proclaim Liberty to
[56:44] the bride of Jesus Christ set her free
[56:48] that she could take a change bring her
[56:51] to a fifty to make a change this message
[56:57] the prophets message that's why the
[57:01] nineteen fifties in 1969 that was the
[57:05] first message I preached first message I
[57:08] preached in this message was in Athens
[57:10] Georgia in 1969 and it was that the
[57:13] bride of Jesus Christ would be the son
[57:17] of man made manifest I can be gladly go
[57:23] with you and read them over and over
[57:26] showing that the bride of Jesus Christ
[57:28] would be the fullness of the Godhead
[57:29] bodily but who wants to listen talk like
[57:34] that because see they can't see you want
[57:39] to hear somebody tell about the goodness

[1:00:01] brought the message his message was not
[1:00:05] a rebuke to the age I've tried my best
[1:00:08] to get you to see that the messenger
[1:00:11] coming to the age is a messenger eternal
[1:00:14] life I tried to get you to see that the
[1:00:16] other day about the Prophet we see a
[1:00:17] prophet is a judgment sign it's a
[1:00:19] judgment side of the world and people
[1:00:21] that don't reject it but a prophet is a
[1:00:23] message of grace to the bride glory
[1:00:29] hallelujah prophet coming to America why
[1:00:32] because there's a bride here the
[1:00:41] messenger comes the end of the age what

[1:01:40] do you need to know that you need to be
[1:01:42] warned again you think the world needs
[1:01:43] to know it needs to be born again well
[1:01:46] you know that born again experiences the
[1:01:47] new birth and it's the birth of the word
[1:01:49] right within the headstone would be the
[1:01:52] birth of more than word so you're saying
[1:01:55] we don't need to headstone that's why
[1:01:57] we're dying and going by the grave
[1:01:58] that's why we're here fifty years after
[1:02:01] to go into the profit
[1:02:02] why because we're not taking what he
[1:02:05] said we're still looking for something
[1:02:08] to come instead of believing what he
[1:02:12] said is it we're looking for something
[1:02:18] to come trying to find some way to make
[1:02:22] it on some idea of our own well you
[1:02:27] don't believe in this you know I believe
[1:02:29] I've told you and I've been over and
[1:02:31] over it and I don't care what you think
[1:02:32] I said this from day one the
[1:02:36] resurrection could come there's going to
[1:02:38] be thirty forty days until the time of
[1:02:41] us to be changed in a moment in the
[1:02:42] twinkling of an eye so we can have a
[1:02:46] glorious opportunity of brother Branham
[1:02:49] coming to preach to us I've never said
[1:02:53] nothing against it we get you making me
[1:02:56] say things that I'm not saying you're
[1:03:02] not listening to catching the word
[1:03:05] you're not putting it up on the basis of
[1:03:07] the word you realize what I'm saying if
[1:03:10] the messenger come at the end of the age
[1:03:11] and you put Paul at the end of Ephesus
[1:03:15] where are you gonna wind up of course
[1:03:22] you're gonna wind up by out of the
[1:03:23] prophets message called I'm gonna read
[1:03:24] to you alright but the thing of your
[1:03:27] thoughts of your mind is you don't know
[1:03:29] what eternal life he is you don't know
[1:03:31] what in the world we're talking about
[1:03:33] you don't know why in the world you'd
[1:03:35] have to have a Jubilee over seven years
[1:03:37] and then our Jubilee for a 50th all of
[1:03:41] those things you don't listening
[1:03:42] the word you just taking your own ideas
[1:03:49] and we went through enough to your to be
[1:03:54] able to understand what was brother
[1:03:56] branham's message okay
[1:04:00] trying to do God a service right being
[1:04:02] with not in the years of preparation but
[1:04:05] when he begins to sound works is faith
[1:04:09] Express not in the healing service the
[1:04:12] message that follows the healing service
[1:04:15] I have heard but now I see the message
[1:04:18] that follows the healing service I've
[1:04:24] read these over and over to you the
[1:04:26] rapture knowing that this message would
[1:04:30] come he knew there was a message coming
[1:04:36] he thought he'd fulfilled the most of it
[1:04:39] until he found out where it was really
[1:04:41] laying out there's a man here that can
[1:04:50] turn on the light this is introducing
[1:04:52] the headstone you remember that from
[1:04:54] Wednesday the message voice of the sign
[1:04:58] this is introducing the Messiah to the
[1:05:03] people questions and answers in 61 when
[1:05:11] he said I began to sound forth the
[1:05:13] message worded protons message begun I'm
[1:05:20] spoken word his original seed I like
[1:05:21] this one because it covers it good he
[1:05:24] said your message self for run the
[1:05:25] second coming of Christ or the full run
[1:05:28] the coming word and which Christ is the
[1:05:31] word that's why I say it like that it
[1:05:34] didn't say on the river there of Ohio
[1:05:36] River that you'll turn the hearts of the
[1:05:38] children back to the faith of the Father
[1:05:39] he doesn't say that but we know Malachi
[1:05:43] says it'll do that and that's what he
[1:05:45] done but yet it speaks all the way from
[1:05:48] dark lean to the end and says your
[1:05:50] message self for run the second coming
[1:05:59] well because there was more to his
[1:06:01] message than just adding the faith of
[1:06:03] the fathers that talking about long ago
[1:06:05] trying to get it it's got to go on to
[1:06:07] that part for putting 10 revelation 10 7
[1:06:10] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:06:12] angel when he begins to sound the
[1:06:13] mystery of God's would be finished
[1:06:15] that's part two we just covered part 1
[1:06:18] of turning their hearts back to the
[1:06:23] faith of the father or to is to take us
[1:06:29] to a change of the body
[1:06:39] let me just read this one I quote tried
[1:06:42] to quote it the other night I see
[1:06:44] brother branham when he brains things we
[1:06:46] look at it in a crazy way okay if you
[1:06:51] want to come up to number 11 if they can
[1:06:56] get it up on the screen number 11 which
[1:07:00] is the unveiling of God the pillar fire
[1:07:04] appearing visible among us and
[1:07:05] identifying that the message is right
[1:07:07] like he did at Mount Sinai I remember
[1:07:10] before the true message come forth Moses
[1:07:12] preached and led them out of Egypt take
[1:07:15] that to the faith of the fathers before
[1:07:17] anything could happen the place of the
[1:07:20] father's has to be returned to the
[1:07:21] church come on read it
[1:07:25] remember before the true message come
[1:07:27] forth
[1:07:29] Moses priests and led them out of Egypt
[1:07:33] but there before the real Commandments
[1:07:36] was laid down the seals was brought in
[1:07:39] ain't that something brother branham
[1:07:42] could make the Ten Commandments of seven
[1:07:44] seals but you're thinking of Ten
[1:07:48] Commandments is being a book of rules
[1:07:52] the Ten Commandments was a revelation of
[1:07:55] Jesus Christ
[1:07:55] our Paul was wrong Oh Paul said why what
[1:08:06] did Paul say that to prove that he
[1:08:07] wasn't wrong what did Paul say to prove
[1:08:09] that brother branham note what he was
[1:08:11] talking about Paul said the law was
[1:08:13] spiritual he's that scripture he said
[1:08:20] but I'm calling off Paul said the law
[1:08:23] was spiritual
[1:08:25] see the law was Jesus Christ in letter
[1:08:29] form what is the seals Jesus Christ in
[1:08:34] the letter form what had to be preached
[1:08:41] we thanked the Ten Commandments and it's
[1:08:44] a buckaroo thou shalt not steal thou
[1:08:45] shalt not kill thou shalt not
[1:08:51] but see that's what we think of 10
[1:08:54] commandments I look at it as a
[1:09:00] revelation of Jesus Christ and I look at
[1:09:06] the seals is a complete revelation of
[1:09:08] Jesus Christ
[1:09:09] what do you look at it for well I've
[1:09:12] always heard it - the law was this this
[1:09:14] condemn us all said the law was
[1:09:19] spiritual because it tried it's best to
[1:09:25] bring Jesus Christ out in the open and
[1:09:27] you know what it finally did he finally
[1:09:30] appeared on earth walked out upon those
[1:09:33] Ten Commandments
[1:09:41] but a random preached the message and he
[1:09:44] said the seals came what look before the
[1:09:52] real commandments was laid down the
[1:09:53] seals was brought in God come down
[1:09:55] before the people and prove that Moses
[1:09:57] was sent in a pillar of fire did God
[1:10:01] come down in this last days and prove
[1:10:02] this messenger was correct did he do
[1:10:10] those times yeah yeah a lot of you
[1:10:13] sitting here right now saw it then you
[1:10:16] ought to realize there was something
[1:10:17] taking place but what was taking place
[1:10:21] not in two years of preparation what was
[1:10:24] he talking about years of preparation
[1:10:30] when God was trying to get man to see
[1:10:35] signs and wonders was to catch the
[1:10:38] attention of the people right
[1:10:41] for what reason why was the signs and
[1:10:46] wonders went first to try to get the
[1:10:50] people to believe the message that was
[1:10:52] following what's so wonderful we could
[1:11:01] ever see it will run the coming word
[1:11:06] that's what your prophet said spoken
[1:11:08] word regional see the coming word which
[1:11:11] is Christ read spoken words regional
[1:11:16] seat said your message will forerun the
[1:11:22] second coming okay
[1:11:28] he priest Moses did and let him out and
[1:11:33] then God came down on the mountain now
[1:11:39] brother Branham said that Israel didn't
[1:11:42] get what they thought they got so that
[1:11:46] means we didn't get what we thought it
[1:11:48] was he said they didn't get what they
[1:11:50] thought it right he said they thought it
[1:11:51] was a book of rules he said but it's a
[1:11:55] revelation of Jesus cry now what about
[1:11:57] me and you what's the Ten Commandments
[1:11:58] to you that's got much steal thou shalt
[1:12:00] not commit adultery thou shalt honor I
[1:12:04] thought in there somewhere that was
[1:12:06] wanting something about behold all
[1:12:08] Israel the Lord our God is one you see
[1:12:12] you can't get the Ten Commandments are
[1:12:14] any of you from even read that enough to
[1:12:17] know you got to put about four different
[1:12:19] things together to get to full Ten
[1:12:20] Commandments to come out correctly well
[1:12:25] no I read it so on to go read a little
[1:12:27] bit more you'll find out there's some
[1:12:30] things said in other places they
[1:12:34] wouldn't said in the original part okay
[1:12:36] see because you don't go that away well
[1:12:39] listen Paul came at the end of the age
[1:12:44] now listen
[1:12:50] is the sign of the end time sir neighs
[1:12:54] church age that is messenger he can go
[1:12:56] to 15 if you want to we know that Paul
[1:13:01] was the first messenger and when the
[1:13:04] first trumpet sounded and the first seal
[1:13:07] was tore loose and he's putting the
[1:13:11] seals and Paul was the first messenger
[1:13:15] as we found and what did he do
[1:13:18] declared war on what I asked you minute
[1:13:23] ago
[1:13:24] did Paul rebuke the church at Ephesus or
[1:13:29] did he bring a message of deliverance to
[1:13:31] Ephesus
[1:13:32] then who did he rebuked the Orthodox
[1:13:38] Church for not believing the Messiah
[1:13:42] that Jesus had produced to them are you
[1:13:54] Paul declared war and was condemning the
[1:13:59] Orthodox Church for not believing the
[1:14:01] Messiah sign that Jesus had produced to
[1:14:03] them why they should have known it they
[1:14:06] should have known him remember Paul come
[1:14:08] at the end of the age all the messengers
[1:14:10] come on the end come at the end of the
[1:14:12] age that's the end time when these
[1:14:14] things are brought forth
[1:14:16] Paul knowing the Scriptures and knowing
[1:14:18] that Jesus was Messiah and he blasted
[1:14:21] those synagogues not to church at
[1:14:24] Ephesus now from place to place with the
[1:14:28] Scriptures and was put out of every one
[1:14:30] of them till finally he shook the dust
[1:14:32] off his feet and turn to the Gentiles
[1:14:34] what was it sounding of a trumpet an
[1:14:37] angel messenger come on all came at the
[1:14:42] end of Pentecost the book of Acts is
[1:14:49] what I call penny collars the Orthodox
[1:14:52] Church the synagogue's who did Paul
[1:14:55] rebuke those people for not believing
[1:14:59] the message that had come forth by the
[1:15:03] Lord Jesus and naturally had went into
[1:15:06] the church and Peter in the book of Acts
[1:15:09] you remember what was bringing out son
[1:15:12] and heir of Winston you know Peter had a
[1:15:15] message you know whatever born-again
[1:15:17] believers got a message letter Brendan
[1:15:21] said what should we go to the school and
[1:15:24] he said tell him how the candle got lit
[1:15:27] Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost
[1:15:29] after the Holy Ghost felt and preached a
[1:15:31] sermon he had a message and condemned
[1:15:35] them people for not accepting Jesus
[1:15:39] Christ and said this is that that was
[1:15:42] spoken of by the prophets he had a
[1:15:45] message every born to bring in believers
[1:15:47] got amazing you got a message carry that
[1:15:49] message well president I don't know what

[1:15:59] there said well should I preach now he
[1:16:02] said I had a message but I've got a
[1:16:04] message now and I believe I need to

[1:16:09] and take care of you duds and forget it
[1:16:12] you know what I mean you need to get
[1:16:15] back to working at home instead of and I
[1:16:18] ain't what brother so-and-so says that a
[1:16:20] woman or two stay in the kitchen and
[1:16:21] I've nothing to do with it no I believe
[1:16:23] in the sisters having something to do
[1:16:25] with this just as well as the men but
[1:16:27] just get in your place if I was a woman
[1:16:32] and and I had been a preacher for 20
[1:16:35] years and found out I wasn't supposed to
[1:16:36] be preaching I'd be the freest woman has
[1:16:38] ever been in the world because I know
[1:16:40] then I'd be following God's Word well I
[1:16:42] bet you can't do that code it's burning
[1:16:45] within my heart blabber okay you know
[1:16:51] but listen the truth order set us free
[1:16:56] we shouldn't have to talk about hiring
[1:16:59] clothes and dresses or whether your
[1:17:01] woman's supposed to preach or what
[1:17:02] you're supposed to do
[1:17:03] we shouldn't have to even talk about
[1:17:05] that not 50 years after listening to a
[1:17:08] prophet of course if we've been
[1:17:10] listening 50 years when I even asked you
[1:17:16] to read or listen to a tape do you go
[1:17:19] home and do it let's go ain't nobody
[1:17:22] gonna tell me what I'm gonna do I'm
[1:17:23] gonna do what I want to well bless God
[1:17:24] go on do I go to hell you're off my
[1:17:27] blood
[1:17:27] cause I've told you the truth I don't
[1:17:32] mean that sarcastically their hateful I
[1:17:34] mean the truth you're taking yourself
[1:17:37] out from under the blood when you won't
[1:17:38] do what somebody tells you ain't got
[1:17:43] time you got time for everything else
[1:17:48] right okay Paul was rebuking the
[1:17:57] Orthodox Church for getting away from
[1:18:04] the Lord Jesus in his message
[1:18:06] so he came at the end of the age where
[1:18:10] did he come right here as axe was
[1:18:13] dwindling down Paul came right here at
[1:18:16] the end of the age rebuked the age prior
[1:18:18] and brought his message as Paul days was
[1:18:21] dwindling down Iranians came on to a and
[1:18:24] to be the messenger to the Smyrna and he
[1:18:27] rebuked Paul's people for getting away
[1:18:30] from the message and brought his message
[1:18:31] therefore it comes all the way down the
[1:18:33] same way all right but here's the key
[1:18:39] you got seven men right Paul Iranians
[1:18:43] Martin Klem with the West you got seven
[1:18:45] men all right now you're hooked in time
[1:18:48] because you're still under a seven you
[1:18:51] agreed with that while ago now let's see
[1:18:52] if you agree with you kind of looked and
[1:18:55] lo que yo coach in seven seven is 49 and
[1:18:58] you had a Jubilee over seven years no
[1:19:00] just kind of going along with that let's
[1:19:02] see if you go along with it now when we
[1:19:06] let your prophet place the ages and the
[1:19:09] people and you can't argue right so what
[1:19:18] did the Prophet say now come on up
[1:19:20] number 16 brother let's read and we'll
[1:19:24] get through this and hurry come up to 16
[1:19:28] which is the first seal you got it
[1:19:36] okay let's read and listen to what he
[1:19:44] says then along come to Pentecostal age
[1:19:50] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit they
[1:19:53] cabbage down on that now I've heard it
[1:19:55] even right here big man's not supposed
[1:19:57] to be appreciate stood right here I done
[1:19:59] told him he's wrong but he come here and
[1:20:01] said it he said in Pentecostals or false
[1:20:03] I declared it down there school I said
[1:20:05] Gillan told him that brother Branham
[1:20:07] said they had the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:09] Ghost exactly like it come on the death
[1:20:11] penalty you think that corrected him no
[1:20:14] but I done told him before he come here
[1:20:16] but I wouldn't a pastor so I didn't say
[1:20:18] anything else to it but you see that's
[1:20:22] where we get our ideas and we won't
[1:20:25] listen we won't even read the Prophet
[1:20:28] let's read
[1:20:30] I like little brother ones brother
[1:20:32] Maloney I like what he had to say about
[1:20:34] he called it third grade reading you
[1:20:36] know what third grade reading is third
[1:20:38] grade reading is one two three four ABCD
[1:20:42] CatDog John you know Mary going to town
[1:20:47] in other words simple reading third
[1:20:51] grade reading is simple reading right
[1:20:54] now let's do some simple reading
[1:21:05] let's see what this profit has to say
[1:21:07] about this baptism when I old ago he's
[1:21:08] sitting they can't Beach down on it and
[1:21:10] there cannot be no more ages that's all
[1:21:13] of it
[1:21:14] that's the fill it out are the lady or
[1:21:16] C&H but that we found in a study of the
[1:21:18] scripture that the messenger to the age
[1:21:20] come right at the end of the age every
[1:21:22] time Paul came at the end of the age we
[1:21:25] find out that Iranians come at the end
[1:21:27] of the age Martin into the age Luther at
[1:21:31] the end of the catholic age come on and
[1:21:39] what wesley at the end of the Lutheran
[1:21:43] age where do Wesley come at the end come
[1:21:51] on did Wesley come right up here or did
[1:21:57] Wesley come right here he came at the
[1:21:59] end of Luther's age now that's what your
[1:22:01] prophet is saying so now you go on and
[1:22:03] read on through are either you're gonna
[1:22:08] say the Prophet was wrong
[1:22:11] come on look what he says and at the end
[1:22:16] of the Lutheran age the Pentecostal and
[1:22:20] watching it correctly at the end of the
[1:22:22] sanctification through the baptism of
[1:22:24] the Holy Ghost at the end of the
[1:22:26] Pentecostal age we're supposed to
[1:22:29] receive according to the word as God
[1:22:31] helped me to not to show you here we're
[1:22:33] just to receive a messenger that will
[1:22:34] take this loose ends out there and
[1:22:36] reveal the whole secret of God for the
[1:22:38] wrapping of the church now listen
[1:22:47] Luther at the end of the Catholic age
[1:22:51] and watching Wesley
[1:22:53] at the end of the Lutheran age and
[1:22:56] Pentecost at the end of the age of
[1:23:00] sanctification through the baptism of
[1:23:03] the holy ghost that wants you and at the
[1:23:11] end of the Pentecostal age though you
[1:23:17] ought to be immediately being a
[1:23:18] realizing brother branham was not the
[1:23:20] messenger to lady of seal you ought to
[1:23:23] be picking up on that by now no he's the
[1:23:29] end of the Pentecostal age he's got how
[1:23:33] the message of eternal life come on look
[1:23:35] at the end of the Pentecostal age we're
[1:23:37] supposed to receive according to the
[1:23:38] Word of God help us show you here never
[1:23:41] see you receive a messenger they take
[1:23:42] all the loose in we're at the end of the
[1:23:44] Pentecostal age one more go to the next
[1:23:50] one number 17 which is really if you got
[1:23:54] the old book his old book is 464 of the
[1:23:57] old seal book but this is questions and
[1:24:00] answers on the seals you see it's one of
[1:24:02] those ages only taking a dip into the
[1:24:04] Holy Spirit justification is the work of
[1:24:06] the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work
[1:24:08] of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is
[1:24:10] the Holy Spirit how many of quotes do
[1:24:13] you want that brother Brennan says the
[1:24:15] messenger is the Holy Ghost is that
[1:24:19] enough to agree with it who wasn't
[1:24:21] Luther's day the Holy Ghost who wasn't
[1:24:24] Wesley's day the Holy Ghost right listen
[1:24:28] sanctification is working holy but the
[1:24:30] baptism is the Holy Spirit now watch him
[1:24:32] that's the reason it took a prophetic
[1:24:35] prophet to come down
[1:24:39] now you said well that's brother Brown
[1:24:41] now come on read that's the reason it
[1:24:44] took a prophetic prophet to come down no
[1:24:46] messenger to the age the age of Lady
[1:24:51] you'll see of what is it because the
[1:24:53] holy ghost came himself in his fullness
[1:24:56] of the baptism now you tell me I was
[1:25:00] rusev Street Holy Ghost was false and
[1:25:02] I'll tell you to eat your own words get
[1:25:05] out of the message you just disturbing
[1:25:08] the whole time look that's the reason it
[1:25:12] took a prophetic prophet to come down no
[1:25:14] messenger to the age because the Holy
[1:25:16] Ghost came himself in its fullness of
[1:25:18] the baptism he called him a prophetic
[1:25:20] prophet but at the end of the age that
[1:25:23] it always ends upon the others we find
[1:25:25] are the messenger sent and these
[1:25:27] scruples and things that are to be
[1:25:29] placed in their place Lee like that then
[1:25:31] the rapture comes for the church so
[1:25:36] where did brother Branham come did
[1:25:40] brother Branham come here or here
[1:25:46] Elijah see they draw this according to
[1:25:49] that but Elijah comes right here Elijah
[1:25:56] comes at the end of the Pentecostal age
[1:25:59] which is the age of lady of seal but
[1:26:01] Brandon was not the messenger to lady
[1:26:03] you'll see the Holy Ghost he just said
[1:26:04] it the Holy Ghost came himself who's the
[1:26:09] manager but wait a minute you got it all
[1:26:11] messed up no ain't got it right why
[1:26:14] because you've got seven men but you've
[1:26:20] got eight manifestations of God Paul
[1:26:25] Iranian humble Martin Luther Wesley
[1:26:29] baptismal Holy Ghost and then Elijah to
[1:26:32] come they see Church do you have no
[1:26:36] hopes you don't you have no hope unless
[1:26:40] you can get rid of random to be an
[1:26:42] eighth messenger or the man to bring the
[1:26:45] message to us
[1:26:47] we're hooked in a seven hooked in time
[1:26:51] I'm reading you the message he placed
[1:26:55] the ages come on Luther come at the end
[1:27:01] of the Catholic age well let you know
[1:27:03] that that's good you read we read the
[1:27:06] next one Wesley come at the end of
[1:27:08] Luther's age and said Pentecost come at
[1:27:11] the end of Wesley's age in the baptism
[1:27:14] of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:15] Oh juice the street was just the gifts
[1:27:21] or you're blind as a dog in a blind dog
[1:27:25] in a meat house at least he can smell
[1:27:32] the Holy Ghost came himself in the gifts
[1:27:40] and you know the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:27:42] Azusa Street and Azusa Street was still
[1:27:45] Trinitarians do you know that you know
[1:27:49] the oneness doctrine had never been even
[1:27:51] caught until about nineteen eleven or
[1:27:54] twelve they were Trinitarians on the day
[1:28:01] of Pentecost Azusa Street now we're
[1:28:03] going to get into a green masterpiece if
[1:28:05] you will we run around them covered how
[1:28:09] Mary represented
[1:28:12] Pentecost when he said Marie was not the
[1:28:18] seed she was a carrier of the seed he
[1:28:24] was the seed they were not even
[1:28:30] listening the Holy Ghost came on the
[1:28:34] Zeus's tree brother Brennan said exactly
[1:28:37] like the day of Pentecost
[1:28:40] but just because so-and-so says well I
[1:28:43] don't understand that
[1:28:44] none of us understand it we can
[1:28:46] understand that but brother was all done
[1:28:47] if he might gonna understand it be
[1:28:49] brothers Owens hope I like one statement
[1:28:55] that was made years ago rudder on him
[1:29:00] said it and brother I remember a brother
[1:29:01] would because I remember this Titan
[1:29:03] brother around and said a little old
[1:29:05] woman wife's water woman you know don't
[1:29:07] even know where ABC says you can help
[1:29:10] you if she's got to hold it up if she's
[1:29:15] got to hold a ghost she can hit me but
[1:29:18] who's gonna listen to a little old
[1:29:19] wife's one you gonna get the preachers
[1:29:26] this message to listen to women
[1:29:34] oh no we're gonna put him out well it's
[1:29:37] like I said about one brother and he he
[1:29:40] said then women ought to be in the
[1:29:41] kitchen well I didn't think to ask him
[1:29:45] cuz it ain't none of my business but I
[1:29:47] want to know does his wife go out and
[1:29:49] get a natural job and work now if you're
[1:29:56] gonna put the woman in the kitchen get
[1:29:57] her out of the workplace
[1:29:59] come on no we put them in the workplace
[1:30:03] and that's men go fishing and hunting oh
[1:30:07] we got it straight the woman's in their
[1:30:10] price they're supposed to be in the
[1:30:12] kitchen well what are they doing down
[1:30:13] working at the place where the men are
[1:30:16] there with them all the time
[1:30:20] you see that's what people don't like me
[1:30:22] cuz that's just a well thing I mean if
[1:30:25] I'm gonna tell my wife she can't do you
[1:30:27] can't tell me nothing about the message
[1:30:29] cause you just a woman now you show me
[1:30:32] that in the Bible I'll show you some
[1:30:34] prophetess I'll show you some women in
[1:30:37] the Bible that was used you go ahead and
[1:30:40] do what you want to but now here I am
[1:30:42] say I do that say that would be right to
[1:30:45] put the women back in the kitchen who's
[1:30:49] gonna work and buy the groceries you
[1:30:53] sorry bunch of men ain't gonna work you
[1:30:57] got your wife out there working well my
[1:31:00] wife's got to work cold wet yeah because

[1:31:22] philippi old work well how old is she
[1:31:30] well she's working you see that's why it
[1:31:34] don't fit with me that's why I'm not
[1:31:36] popular but you see I like it that away
[1:31:40] because I can stand for the truth and I
[1:31:42] don't have to back up on anything
[1:31:45] I can read what the Prophet said when he
[1:31:47] said Paul come at the end of the age and
[1:31:49] then when he brings it down to the end
[1:31:51] and brings it to that the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] came on the Zeus's Street in the
[1:31:58] fullness and brother Brown called it
[1:31:59] another great prophet he wouldn't come
[1:32:05] buddy self because he said dinner that
[1:32:07] into the age of messenger come now back
[1:32:09] up to the Leviticus just a second
[1:32:11] seven seven is 49 ceiling that forty
[1:32:14] ninth that messenger in the 49th was
[1:32:17] special he had the Clara the fiftieth he
[1:32:25] had to declare the fiftieth he had to
[1:32:27] speak that the fiftieth was present you
[1:32:29] couldn't go free unless you had to
[1:32:31] messenger to tell you you could go free
[1:32:34] but I want to know about 250 I want to
[1:32:37] know about the new birth that makes my
[1:32:39] soul eternal I want to know about the
[1:32:41] new birth it'll take me all the way to
[1:32:43] the change of the body I want to know
[1:32:45] about this message has within it rapture
[1:32:48] in faith and rats through and grace lays
[1:32:50] in this message the prophets message
[1:32:53] began through the opening of the seals
[1:32:55] before then he was in preparation of all
[1:32:58] the other things and when those seals
[1:32:59] broke through the Prophet the message
[1:33:01] went into eternal life right the message
[1:33:08] went into eternal life we've had an
[1:33:14] eternal life message we're not having to
[1:33:16] throw to be looking for we've got it in
[1:33:19] our possession but do we believe it was
[1:33:26] like I said now I'm gonna called brother
[1:33:27] so-and-so said this brother so-and-so
[1:33:29] said to Azusa Street was false well then
[1:33:31] you can't we read where brother Branham
[1:33:33] said that there was a great prophet came
[1:33:36] on the Zeus's tree you can't read where
[1:33:38] he says the Holy Ghost came exactly like
[1:33:41] the day of Pentecost Azusa Street so now
[1:33:46] who's lying
[1:33:47] come on musicians who's lying who's the
[1:33:50] who's got it
[1:33:54] it's vital to understand the messenger
[1:33:57] coming at the end of the age because
[1:34:03] somebody's got to stand between me and
[1:34:04] you and eternity and call for it well
[1:34:10] your prophets already done it
[1:34:12] are you better be looking for somebody
[1:34:15] else your prophet has already brought
[1:34:23] this message what are we doing well we
[1:34:33] just don't understand don't understand
[1:34:35] you know you don't want to read third
[1:34:38] grade reading said Azusa Street was the
[1:34:41] baptism of the holy ghost no messenger
[1:34:43] the prophet said to the aged mezuzahs
[1:34:50] Street started off with the baptism of
[1:34:52] the Holy Ghost and may I quote brother
[1:34:54] Branham he was required referring to
[1:34:59] them was the day of Pentecost Azusa
[1:35:01] Street and he said they were closer to
[1:35:04] the coming of the Lord than we are do
[1:35:06] you want that quote yeah I don't mind
[1:35:10] stating all these things because you see
[1:35:14] they were totally dependent upon God
[1:35:17] because they hadn't even heard the
[1:35:19] message of Malachi 4 but they depended
[1:35:27] upon God come on Lord bring us to our
[1:35:32] knees but get us out of here hit us out
[1:35:39] of here because we winding up and
[1:35:41] running out
[1:35:42] there's listen Church come on the tapes
[1:35:45] is back there from not from 2002 if you
[1:35:49] want to see if I've changed my doctrine
[1:35:50] but there's people sitting here that was
[1:35:53] here when I preached these things back
[1:35:56] in the 70s and 80s because I've always
[1:36:01] preached the messenger come at the end
[1:36:03] of the age
[1:36:03] and I've always preached it from what
[1:36:05] the prophet brought he's the one that
[1:36:07] praise placed the messengers read it
[1:36:09] he placed who come at the end of what I
[1:36:13] didn't have enough sense to do it I have
[1:36:16] done it right opposite I'd have brought
[1:36:18] Pilate to end of Ephesus
[1:36:21] how could Paul come at the end of heaven
[1:36:23] system and bring the message to Ephesus
[1:36:27] hey don't don't run with me and don't
[1:36:29] scream and holler brother Dale don't
[1:36:31] understand they were some of those men
[1:36:33] we're already dead before the age
[1:36:34] started in time don't get with me I
[1:36:36] ain't got no time to argue with you I'm
[1:36:39] just telling you I know that there were
[1:36:41] some of those men you can't lay there
[1:36:43] their message right down on a certain
[1:36:45] date so this is that or the other I know
[1:36:47] that so don't do it get out of it get
[1:36:52] down to believe in it it's either this
[1:36:55] message or we have no hopes either the
[1:36:58] Prophet brought the message or you and I
[1:36:59] are in bad shape and if he brought the
[1:37:03] message why can't we believe it what we
[1:37:05] got brother come here I'm sorry
[1:37:07] went over a few minutes that's because
[1:37:12] in biscuits there's more I - biscuits
