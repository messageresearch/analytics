some words of encouragement I know we've got many needs that just back there talk brother Wade about all the different needs and there's a request come in to please remember brother Dy um his I guess his youngest his baby daughter just passed yesterday and uh she was 47 and and uh so yeah that's my goodness just remember him um tonight we're going to read from 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 um again I think that was a scripture I was on last last time and uh so yeah y'all remember us this Sunday we'll be going out of town and then keep her there and in prayer he'll be going out of town and out of the country soon so um we sure be well she'll be thinking thinking about you and praying for you brother amen 2 Thessalonians chapter 2: 1 to8 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word and we're so grateful tonight to have your word as a comfort when All the Troubles of life as sail us and this Satan just throws his darts at us and things seem to go maybe not the way that we intended or hoped that they would go things take a turn for the South Lord we know that all things work to the good of them that are love the Lord and are called according to your purpose Lord many many times it things like seems like things squeeze us a little bit but we have confidence because your word says you'll never leave us you'll never forsake us you're always with us I thank you Lord Lord God for these promises that you given unto us that are laying here in your word and I pray God that tonight you'll just bless the word Lord that that you'll help us Lord that you'll Quicken it to us and you'll just feel at Liberty Lord to move Among Us Lord and to open up these things to us to make it live to us so that it's more than just something laying here on the page but it's something that will really spring forth and give us encouragement in the hour that we need it we ask these things in your name amen now I want to take a a little title from this scripture to come and see and um maybe it'll take me a while to get to that uh to get to that title in my in my message tonight but um Lord will and you'll see why I I titled it that so we'll start at verse one here in 2 Thessalonians now we beseech you brethren in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means oh he's already talking about don't don't let anything deceive you let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God see that's where the Antichrist wants to find himself maybe not so much in the barroom with a honky tonk but right here in the religious right here messing with you let's say it like that right here poking and prodding at you remember you not that when I was yet I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity do already work now think about that he's saying it's already working you don't see it maybe uh very apparent right there in front of you but it's working only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth oh that's a promise that we're all looking for and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming the Lord bless you you may be seated I thought I thought I was going to be cold tonight but I'm going to go ahead and take this the weather's changing on us it's getting chilly but it's warm up here now think about that for the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who now lth now brother Brandon will explain is he God that lth and this doesn't mean to that allow that would allow but that would prevent there's something holding off the devil from being able to just spring fully into full manifestation but now that's going to happen when the bride leaves the Earth or to think now that that you the that Christ is living in you and you are actually preventing that death devil from fully springing into action and and uh taking taking full control of the think what it's going to be like when the bride leaves there won't be any Holy Ghost left on the earth there won't be any anybody that that is a real Christian there won't be anything left but the devil and why would you want to be left in a situation like that I I think it behooves us to really you know just constantly be checking up and the the hour that you you know your situation and make sure that you really are born again because you certainly wouldn't want to be left in that kind of a situation only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming so one day one day we can see that Christ is going to step out of the way and then the wicked one shall be revealed but the mystery of iniquity is already working now you oh you think you think what what the mystery of iniquity that that Antichrist Spirit there's a spirit moving and what his goal is to deceive to get you off of the mark to get you off of the off of the track that God God wants you to rely fully on his word to look to his word for everything you have need of there's where you'll find peace and contentment and joy and and and and and and and all those the ability to forgive one another and love and all those promises that laying there in the scripture and the devil don't want you to have none of that so he's constantly he's constantly at work to try to deceive and try what's what's he trying to do he's trying to get you to doubt the weapon that God has given you that God has given you God has given you his word and the devil's constantly at work to get you to doubt that and now isn't that true all down through your Christian Journey think you maybe you'll maybe you'll get through a rough spot and things don't maybe go quite the way you like just like we were praying and and and the devil will begin to poke and tell you tell you things to make you deny or or doubt the the the way that the word says it now now this is what brother R said in the first seal he said we were talking the other day about people who getting off the track it is just like shooting a Target if that gun is perfectly balanced perfectly trained and sighted it's got to hit the target unless that Barrel moves or twists or vibrations throws it off and wherever or wind puff now now really that's what we're talking about tonight that mystery of iniquity something to get that gun to shake the gun something to shake a wind puff or something something come along and he'll just throw something at it to make you to make you is it really is he really the same is he really with me I don't feel like he's with me oh but you can have confidence in the word of God just stay right with the word of God and brother ra said wherever it starts off at there's only one way to do is come back to where it left the track come back to where you stopped believing come back to where you got off the Target and start again if it's going to hit the target if it doesn't why it just doesn't hit the target and that's the way in studying scripture I believe he said you'll never figure it with your mind that's right it takes the lamb to reveal it amen the lamb alone can do it I I to think about that tonight that when God gives you a revelation it's something that some man didn't do it's something Supernatural that took place in your life that God opened up the book and showed something to you and it's something that so oh you just know that it's supernatural when God reveals it to you and God is going to have a target hdden church we've got a quick why cuz we've got a lamb to reveal these things we've got a lamb who has only the lamb was worthy to open up the book but the lamb has made us bth worthy so that we can look into these things and that gives us confidence to know that we're going to God is going to have a Target hitting Church a church that is balanced a church that is unmovable unmovable by the things that the devil can throw at it and say well I don't think God cares about you I don't think this promises for you no cuz the word says it is says it's mine the word promised it God is going to have a church that is true because she stands for the word so what's our Target now now last time I think we were kind of talking about the target the target is that Capstone that we're trying to get to the Target is the seventh seals but let's kind of go even Beyond just looking at the Seven Seals the target is the seven Thunders under the seventh seal now brother R said now in in the seventh seal he said now you you notice on the opening of this seventh seal it's also in a three-fold mystery this one I have will speak and I've spoke that it is the mystery of the seven Thunders amen now I'm just kind of laying like just a p throwing the pattern out there so we can so we can look and and think about these things he said under the seventh seal under the seventh seal it is The Mystery of the seven Thunders and he said the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it will be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said no one knew when he would return so now you think about that pattern laying there that like maybe maybe will lay it up against like the pattern of the seven Church ages seven Church ages where all these Loose Ends maybe maybe you could probe and say well this maybe I think this messenger is the right messenger for the first church age but then at the seventh Church age a messenger come along to just tie up all the Loose Ends until there ain't no question anymore now hold that same pattern up that that you can maybe maybe you can probe and and thing maybe you get a little Glimpse at what the first seal is and you could preach about it and all those things but the seventh seal ends it all up it's the end of it so you maybe there's some things that you can see in the first seal maybe there's some things that we can preach about but when the seventh seal is open it ties it all up so there ain't no question anymore and then you can see the thing that was hidden under that that maybe that curtain or under that tapestry that the Masterpiece is hiding under the things the veil is taken off and you can see the whole thing there so maybe you could say we could say it like this that maybe you can pair what you heard somebody say about the seals maybe you can just repeat it maybe you get kind of a good intellectual understanding in your head about what somebody said about it maybe you can understand you heard somebody say that the first seal is justification and you repeat it after them you say well the first Seal's got something to do with justification and I'm repeating it after you maybe you know the Seal's technically maybe you know that it has something to do with one God and you can look and you can read that quote where brother R said my revelation of the first seal is that the that I'm standing here and the white horse rider goes there and you can say you can see where he's saying my revelation of the first seal is that it reveals one God and you can you know the symbols and you can have all of brother brandham statements memorized oh but the Thunder is the voice of God to you the Thunder is God revealing himself and revealing what that thing is and and not just that but making the thing live I'm talking about tonight that this gospel has got to be lived I I think maybe if we could just get away from the notion that we could just know it and if we if we got enough understanding that we could just confuse somebody else and hurt somebody else's feelings and poke and and pride and all those kind of things but somebody's got to make this gospel live and the Thunder shows that it's alive it's Alive walking on two feet in Revelation chap 6 it said now now think about this pattern that we've got here Revelation 6 verse1 I saw John looking he I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see amen and brother said no doubt John might have jumped up in the air when the Thunder roared the Thunder roared and he might have whoa might have might have scared him a little bit and there when the first seal opened a sounded like a Thunder and we know what brother R said I don't think we need to go into all the background of the Thunder is the voice of God speaking and without a revelation you won't understand it's just like thunder rolling but when you understand you can hear the message that's being preached well thank god tonight that you could hear not just hear hear falsehood but but you can rejoice when you hear something good being preached I'm so glad that when something TR the truth is being preached behind the pullit I can recognize it and and shout and give glory to God and something within my heart goes to burning when I hear something good being preached not just to be able to discern the the evil or the the the wrong Doctrine but to be able to discern the good so when you hear the thunder and you can hear what it's saying that's one of the greatest blessings that God can give to you to be able to hear his voice but there's a difference between that Thunder and the Seven thunders in Revelation 10: 2 he said and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when when he had cried seven Thunders other their voices now I just maybe want you to think about that what would be the difference between that Thunder and the Seven Thunders there's a thunder that sounds and then a little bit longer later there's seven Thunders right you think now you can probe and prod and all all these things as they're kind of talked about but one day the full thing will be revealed in Revelation chapter 4 he said oh we how we need and Jeffersonville thousands now think think about the way he we know this quote we've quoted it over and over thousands of lived voices not just somebody telling you about what they believe but living what they believe the Thunder of God thundering out how and sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish now now there's a thunder not just somebody that say let me tell you what I know but somebody that's living it out living out a Sweet Holy Holy where they they they' separated themselves from the things of this world that's where I'm going tonight separated themselves from all the Netflix and all the junk and all the Tommy rot of this world because they've United themselves in Oneness with word they they they they've just got away from everything that the devil's thrown at them until they're United with what the word says undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish he said yes sir real Christians now that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how you how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil now think about this What Hurts The Devil how many wants to hurt the devil tonight now he said What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on now there's a good test we just throw there's a good test for maturity a good maturity test so oh you see so many times somebody will disagree with somebody and you can just see a rile up you going to disagree with me somebody will oh but there's a thunder a thunder when you can say something or somebody can say something to you and you don't you don't R back somebody can call you something I don't even believe you're a real Christian I don't even believe that you're preaching what what ever unroll the list like one of Paul's lists unroll it call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on he said oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil what what kind of Thunder shakes the devil when you take this word and Let It Be quickened by the spirit in your heart and in your life and it becomes not just a lot of things that you memorized and a lot of statements and things but but it becomes alive alive walking around there oh come on now let's let's simplify what the Thunder I think sometimes we preach the seals and so till so much is it's something we can't even we think it's beyond our grasp but these are things that God has given us the ability to understand God has we we were talking in the family the other night about about this return Ministry that says well basically they read what brother brandham says and and they say well I don't understand it so no body can and what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to wait until until brother brandham comes back to give us to give us another dose of what he already preached now you think about that think about what why brother brandham did not spend all those time all that time preaching the first and second and all the seals and all the all the messages and then he said if you don't understand the seals go back to Christ the mystery of God revealed he didn't preach that and then expect us not to understand it but he preached these things so that we can know so that we could have Rapture in faith how is this going to give you Rapture in faith because when you look into the seal and you recognize that you're not a bluff that you are not a bluff you recognize that your iniquity is gone you recognize that the word has changed your life you recognize that the true super anointing has come upon your life then you know that God is going to change your body because that is what will give you rur and faith you got to have the seals the first seal oh you think about this pattern of the first seal if the first seal reveals the mystery of iniquity and how to get rid of that thing and what it is and how to boot it out and what what does it then the seventh seal Thunder will reveal the end of the iniquity so the seven seal Thunder reveals the end of the thing it's gone it's gone from my life it's gone from the thing and the first seal brother said all right a thunder went off John knew it was the voice of God and then the lionlike creature said come see what it was and John went forth now with his pen to write what he was going to see and the first seal again he said remember aoud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God that's what the Bible said see a clap of Thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him see it was a thunder oh that's what the church is looking for is revelation Revel cuz when God reveals it to you that's how you will overcome the enemy when God reveals something to you the devil will come well I don't I don't think that he's still the same yesterday to Tak him forever and if God's revealed it to you you can say I'm sorry I've already I've already been there I've already had an experience with him I he's already revealed himself to me in the dead of the night when I was praying and seeking God and pouring through the pages sorry I I've already been there I've already met him like Moses when he went to the pillar of when he saw that Pillar of Fire at the burning bush and we went down to Egypt with confidence then because he had met God and sorry sorry Pharaoh I've done been somewhere I've got I'm ready to take over because I've got an experience oh you you see you see how that see look at this pattern you could repeat to over and over again all the maybe the things that you learned in church about being born again and try to act and everything but when when that's really alive in you it's different now you can confess you can say you can say with the word says that's why God now look that that that Antichrist spirit is trying to pull us away from the word but God has called us to separate to separate from everything that's contrary to the word to separate from unbelief to separate from iniquity to separate from the world to separate from Satan and God's covenant with Abraham and his seed brother R said the first thing when God calls a man he calls for total separation from the world separate yourself Abraham as soon as he got his called now now as I'm as I'm reading these quotes think think about that picture of the SE of the first Seal The Lion and the white horse rider and and that devil that that Antichrist Spirit trying to pull you away from the truth and what God sent to come by it think about that picture he said separate yourself Abraham as soon as he got his call now here it is every Christian in here that's born again when God called you called for total separation now what what that means is you got to come to a place where that Antichrist Spirit don't have nothing to do with you amen that you been it's totally been kicked out that that's what the requirement is to get to get out of here to take a body change and the white horse rider what's it trying to do is trying to deceive you into compromising trying to deceive you is poking and prodding and trying to get you to doubt the word trying to get you to where you feel a little a little maybe a tummy ache or something my toothache or or something and you say well I'm not going to go to church today maybe your little cat gets sick and you say well I'm not going to go to church today and then you could just Blossom that unroll the scroll and all the things that the devil wants to want you to compromise on but if you'll stay right with the word and say I'm not going to compromise with nothing I'm going to do what God Said you watch and see if God doesn't bless you one day there's going to be a little small chosen called out people that God's going to bless them with a body change you see God wants separators he wants to separate that Antichrist Spirit from you so that don't have nothing in you so that oh you see God wants you to totally separate from the things of the world you shouldn't have no trash on Facebook nobody should be able to look at your Facebook page and see a lot of bunch of nudity and a bunch of trash and a bunch of nonsense because God wants a bunch of separated people he wants separated and called out people you shouldn't need a bunch of trash to save your marriage you don't need no trashy books to save your marriage and give you a better married life you say brother B I wonder if you're coming after me tonight well why would it matter if I was chasing after you tonight you need to repent you need to get right you shouldn't need no trash in the world you shouldn't need an influence of the Antichrist spirit in your life you don't need the world's entertainment you don't need nothing that the world has you don't need anything that that Antichrist has now Satan is a faker and a deceiver what's he doing impersonating gifts and tongues and religion and churchianity I'm reading quotes here but there's one thing he cannot do he cannot impersonate that living reveal word he can't impersonate the word brother R said now Satan can imperson can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of a gift I hope you're learning but he can't know this it's not even he's talking about the seventh seal it's not even written in the word he can't know who think now the devil can't know a revelation even if you tell him what it is he'll be like I don't understand the devil don't understand a revelation so now what's under what's revealed under the first seal how are you going to defeat the Devil how do you defeat amen how do you defeat that Antichrist Spirit you're going to defeat him with the word and you're going to defeat him with a revelation a personal revelation that God has given you that's how you going to defeat the Devil every time Satan can't understand Satan can't apprehend Satan can't comprehend Revelation he just don't know so how are you going to defeat the Devil you going to defeat it when the Devil comes with his thoughts and his ideas then what you got to do is you got to be like like a lion and you got to rise up and you say like the like that the word that that lion represented it is written it is written it is written it is written Thou shalt not wor have no other gods before me it is written it is written just like Jesus did when the devil came to him and you'll defeat him that's that's how you drive out the devil from your life as you speak the word like we were talking about a brother the other night that was going through some hard times and and the the way I encourage the brother is don't say nothing God wants an optimist God wants somebody that'll speak positive things don't say don't say nothing don't don't speak anything negative don't say well I don't I'm not worth nothing I'm not worth this or that but speak what the word says and the word is going to be positive to you and Paul was saying that Faker that deceiver is already working right in second Thessalonians what we just read for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way who he that lth see see a mystery the mystery of iniquity way back in that very Church age here which was what deceivers you see I'm just reading some quotes here deceiving the people off into something and brother would say it's a spirit work working to deceive a spirit working to deceive now you see that devil will maybe he'll get in somebody somebody like maybe maybe sometimes preachers to say something contrary to the word oh you that CU that's what the devil the devil wants to do is just get right in amongst all the religion and all the churchianity maybe he'll get in some maybe you're one of your friends to say something that's contrary to the word I don't I don't think you can have it I don't think you can have that that promise there a problem so much is not so much that bar room with a honky Tong but sometimes the problem is the pullit sir now now you think about resisting resisting the devil brother BR and the personation of Christianity he'd say if you'd see a spider in your suit you'd condemn that restaurant and set over at the Chamber of Commerce and you'd write it up in the paper now I I was just meditating on this today or this morning yesterday just thinking about how people do so many times now think about what brother I'm saying if you'd see a spider in your soup you'd condemn that restaurant and then you'd go write it up in the paper or nowadays we go on Facebook or on Google and write a big review I can't believe there's a spider in my suit but so many times people go to a church and they'll just let brother Brown said let the devil cram anything he wants to down that soul of yours that's worth 10,000 worlds to think about what a ridiculous statement that somebody would go would get all irate about the spider in their soup but yet just put up with false Doctrine false doctrine that won't help you defeat the Devil false doctrine that sometimes will just let allow the devil to run rough shot over your life and now you see what are we talking about tonight I'm talking about that it matters what you believe it matters what you eat it matters which preachers you listen to on the internet it matters what you're consume and I I was listening to One Pastor talk about somebody would come this is actually a denominational Pastor he said people they'll have like a guest Minister come in and then it might take the pastor another three months to weed out of the congregation all the false doctrine that that gas Minister preached there behind the pulpit if they're not careful why cuz oh you if you're not careful somebody could come in and throw out a lot of things that gets in the people's minds and gets to turn in things and why because it matters it matters what you believe it matters it matters what you amen you know when you open up your mouth and you say Amen it matters because that signify amen comes from that Hebrew word am which means Faith So when you say Amen you're saying faith I believe what you're saying thank God for people that want to ruminate and think about something that is said over the pullit amen that's why you know you know really it kind of bothers me when I'm preaching more not so much when people don't say Amen but when just people aren't interested cuz if you're interested but even if you're not saying amen as long as you're thinking about it I I just love to see people that are interested in the preaching of the Gospel like you're doing tonight that rejoices my soul thank God for a genuine gospel thank God for something without hypocrisy now that's what that first seal is talking about something without hypocrisy something that's real and genuine God don't want to meal with spiders for you he's got something real for you that'll give you real spiritual vitamins and strengthen you but it behooves us to be on guard we are influenced by Spirits like that Antichrist that mystery of iniquity that it's there's spirits that try to influence us and try to pull us one way or the other try to influence brother Bram said in demonology religious realm he said Christians are influenced from above the Holy Ghost influences his church in this realm of mortal now every Mortal here is influenced by one of these worlds the Devil by these Spirits influence men the devil has His prophets and God has his and God perfecting his church he said the sinner is influenced by spirit because he has a spirit and the wrong gives influence and the right gives influence and those who are dominating ated with Blackness and separation or dominated from the underworld of devils now you think about way back in the beginning when in the Book of Ezekiel when when it said that L Thou Art the anointed cherub thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity found in thee way way back when that war was first fought in heaven iniquity is found in Satan iniquity and he brought that war down to heaven and that iniquity that M that's that mystery of iniquity that started way back there and that same spirit that same spirit is trying to influence yes the Demonic Twisted Spirit of Satan rebelled against God because iniquity was found in now what is Iniquity I know we're right here at the top of the hour so far so good what is Iniquity iniquity is something that you know you ought not to do and you do it anyhow and Paul said there's such in the Earth today workers of iniquity what is Iniquity why would anybody do something that they know that they shouldn't do now y'all know y'all probably remember last time I got to preaching on this why would anybody do something that they know if if you know if your mama told you not to go in the street when you're a little kid cuz the car is going to come by but you just you get all stubborn and everything and you go running out there anyway why would you do that if if your mama told you not to go eat a mushroom don't go put that Berry off that bush in your mouth and and you know you're not supposed to do it you and yet you go run out of that bush and you go popping berries in your mouth and then you got to go take a visit to the ER but you know you shouldn't do it there's there's something there's something broken up and twisted in the way that we're made now you think you think about that I'm not really talking tonight about disobeying your mama like that I'm talking about disobeying the word of God because when God's word says something for is for our profit you know you so many times we'll we'll try to you know a young man or a young woman looking for a spouse and so many times they won't go back and looking for looking at the word they go look look to their what their friends say look to every any everything else but what's good now why is that why do we why do we stray away from from from from what we what we know maybe even intellectually of what's right and what's good that God's word is true in Genesis chapter 2 when God told Adam and Eve and of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die now why why would eve eat from that tree when God told her not to she got to ruminating on it cuz that that devil the devil begin to tell her well see he's doing he's doing the same thing back then that he's trying to do today pull away from the word now see how you can take all these seals and run it right through the Bible absolutely amen that same that same devil that's trying to pull you away from the word tonight tried to pull did pull e EV way amen back there very at the beginning why would anybody want to eat out of a garbage can why do people sit in churches and listen to stuff listen to a bunch of Tommy Rod why would anybody want to do something hurtful why would anybody want to put something harmful in their bodies God when God's plan is for you to be peaceful and contented and joyful and faithful but Satan's plan is to twist and contort that plan into something perverted so iniquity you go back to Hebrew the Hebrew is Avon which means Twisted to bend twist or distort like an old man with a crooked back it's all twisted up cuz it ain't right it should be straight should be able to walk straight but of on means it's twisted so iniquities are bending twisting or distorting of the law of God's word to different degrees and God's word says one thing and iniquity is our Twisted perverted makeup right by Twisted perverted spirit amen that goes contrary to God now maybe maybe right now you're thinking well this sermon kind of now we're getting technical it's time for my eyes to droop a little bit but now think about this think about now the there's iniquity and are you thinking maybe maybe think of it like this I don't want no iniquity in my life but God has given us a way to get rid of the iniquity and that is revealed under the first seal how you can get rid of iniquity how you can get rid of it now let's let's dwell on a little bit more iniquity is something that you know that you're doing that you all not to do and still won't repent of it now there's the problem you know if you know tonight that you're B not born again you know tonight maybe maybe you're sitting here and you know that maybe before you come to church maybe you are looking at something on the Internet you shouldn't have been doing and you know that that's wrong maybe maybe before you come to church maybe maybe there's somebody that just ain't living right and they they vaping get unroll the list of all the things that we could do and you know that you're not doing right and you won't repent of it now there's iniquity he said brother R said God will not hear your prayer if you know you should do it and won't do it if you know you should go be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you won't do it that's iniquity and what about this here's the real Clincher of the summation of it if you know that you need to be born again and you won't do it that's iniquity now you think think about now that has something to do with the first seal you know that you need to be born again and if you won't do it if you won't let the word grip a hold of your life there is Iniquity iniquity is something that you know it's wrong and still holding to it when you know your Creeds are wrong and you still hold to it that's iniquity you know better but won't do it it's iniquity see in Psalm 66:18 it says if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me amen if I know that I ain't living right the Lord will not hear me until till what I Repent you got to make it right amen now if you haven't made it right yet tonight is your call that God is calling you oh if you can hear that Thunder calling you tonight the voice of God pulling and calling at your heart to say that it's time it's time to repent it's time let that iniquity be in the past instead of the present it's time to repent cuz God won't even hear your prayer if you know you're not living right and won't repent everybody's guilty of iniquity and Isaiah chapter 53 it says all all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all now there's how we going to get out of it cuz we got a lamb who's worthy amen and a lamb that can open up the book a lamb that paid the price and he's the one that all of our iniquity was laid upon him so that we could be made perfect am Psalm 51 uh verse 5 says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me amen that you oh think about that now that you were actually shaping you were formed by your mother and father knowing all the trace it all the way back doing something contrary to the word of God cuz you're supposed to come by the spoken something contrary to the word of God cuz you're supposed to come by the spoken word and you come contrary to that so you're actually your makeup is actually shaping and formed in iniquity a product of that and in sin did my mother conceive me and that's why when you you could tell a little child don't go eat don't go get some cookies out of the cookie jar we're fixing to have we're fixing to have supper and he's going to go do it anyway cause he was shaping in iniquity so what's iniquity is that initial State iniquity is the the root the root of the problem it's the initial stage of the root cause amen while sin in iniquity is that Twisted part and sin is what happens after that oh to to lay it out a little bit maybe even planer to know to know that something's wrong and and you're thinking I'm going to do it anyway there's the iniquity and then you go do it and that's sin to know that you shouldn't be doing it and you're meditate over it that's what I I've always wondered how people people get that get so far in the ditch and you think about if you trace it all the way back all the thinking that they had to do to get to that spot and there's the iniquity I know that I shouldn't be doing that maybe uh speak about talk about adultery that's a man and a woman that's married to one another and you know that you shouldn't be looking and going around with somebody else and you start thinking about it and before long cuz that's what happened in the Garden of Eden before long Eve had I mean uh yeah Eve right had a baby in her arms right iniquity is that carnal condition of Fallen man and the Mystery of iniquity is that spirit that got us in that mess y right and Jehovah gy brother ra said every man is deserving of hell for you're born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies there's nothing good about us to begin with because we're all products of what happened there in the garden all trickled down from age to age and iniquity is the reason for lies and theft and murders it's why people are greedy why politics starts off good and becomes evil it's the reason for corruption it's the reason for exploitation for betrayal and oppression it's that deep seated twist twisted and corrupt nature so what's the mystery of iniquity the mystery of iniquity describes that something hidden or not immediately apparent it is the underlying sinful nature or tendencies that are already at work that Spirit moving even if they haven't been manifested overtly it's the thing under the covers that's working and brother Ram said or he said that first stage I'm I'm trying to now we we we're already past 45 minutes so I'm trying I'm looking for a place to start closing in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2:7 we just read for the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who got only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way that Antichrist Spirit wants to control he'll control the whole world that Antichrist spirit will own everything and try to control everybody you think about that that Antichrist Spirit moving until finally in verse 8 of 2 Thessalonians and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish not this bride brother said not this bride because they receive not the love of the truth Christ is the truth the word that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie and brother Brown said the LIE what lie the lie that thou shalt not surely die the lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but that pleasure in unrighteousness and there's that mystery of iniquity what he that Antichrist spirit that hides what's he what's he doing he's hiding in the heart of an unregenerate religious man and really nail it down what it is it's an anointed one as well as right as well as even after you're born again the iniquity that continue to influence these you continues to influence a born- again believer in their Spirit realm after their conversion that's right like somebody getting caught up in false Doctrine and then coming back God will lead them back caught up in the seventh under Doctrine or something like that and then then they lean back or talking behind somebody's back when you know you're not supposed to talk behind somebody's back or looking at circumstances like Peter did looking at the winds and the waves when you know you ain't you're supposed to look at God's word or doubting God's promises like Sarah like giggling in the tent oh but God wants us to hold true to his promises God's going to have a church like that that's balanced and true an antichrist spirit comes in the form of religion I I I I don't want to be churchy I don't want to have no churchianity in it you know sometimes brother R talked about how you can get one another Spirit you can get the pastor's Spirit you get like a church Spirit but I don't want a religious spirit I want I want we'll say the bride spirit I want the spirit of Christ and Christ is the word you know so anything anything Antichrist would have to be anti- word so that means anything anything that's off the word anything that's not correct in this Doctrine would have had to come from the Antichrist anything you hold that is contrary to Christ is Antichrist anything any doctrine that is incorrect is Antichrist amen now you think about and what are we talking about tonight how do I get rid of all that false Doctrine how do I get rid of that you're going to get rid of it by the word amen word upon word here a little there a little precept upon precept adding up building up little blocks in your life you are built up as Lively Lively ston ye are built up the world being built up in you and as it's built up it's pushing out pushing out everything every influence of the devil cuz we're talking about theight influence the devil could maybe the devil's influencing you right now to think about that pot of beans on or whatever think about that that good food you got at home or maybe a good book you got on the laying there on the night stand you want to get home to or all sorts of things and the devil's the devil's constantly trying to pull you and influence you away from the word but think about if you let the word get a hold of your life and the word begin to influence you you think you see what the word does the word is like a it's an Avenue for the spirit to move and the spirit to have Liberty in your life as you believe the word the spirit is loosed in your life now there's the recipe for how to get born again if you want to be born again tonight just let the word have Liberty in your life as the word is is being preached as you un open the the Bible maybe there at night before you go to bed open it up and begin to read to the pages and you'll say well I don't understand I don't understand what it's talking about but let slowly and surely it begins to have a grip on your life and as you something will strike as you read that and you'll say I believe it that's something I know that that's true and you watch if something don't come rushing in it's a spirit loosed on your life and you see that that same process just keeps unfolding and unfolding as the more word that you hear and the more word that you receive until finally it becomes a super anointing and that super anointing unfolds and unfolds until finally there's going to come an anointing that will change the very molecules of your body now see see why that first seal is so important I I hope it's becoming plain to you tonight the first seal reveals what iniquity is and what the mystery of iniquity is and how how it reveals how do I give the devil the boot how how do I get that devil out of me not just out of my soul but out of my spirit out of my whole being how do I get rid of that thing and the seventh seal unfolds until finally the seven the the Thunder can be revealed which reveals to you that it's gone it's all gone and and that shows that you're going in the Rapture what in Luke Chapter 11 just think think about the word being able to kick the devil out in Luke 11 Jesus said if I with the Finger of God cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of God has come upon you when a strong man armed keepeth his Palace his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him when the strong man comes when God comes to the house he going to kick the devil out when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted and divided his spoils the word is stronger than any devil oh you want to have power over the devil in your life just quote speak the word let the word have preeminence in your life if you'll let him Christ if you'll let him Christ will come and take over you think about think about though to be anti- word to be anti- word is to be anti- Jesus that's right absolutely to be anti- word is to be Antichrist because the spirit and the word are one if you are anti- word you will have to be Antichrist sir and if it started in the first church it will have to grow until the end when it takes over and it just becomes Satan Satan's Eden yes sir but God's going to have a little bride that allows the word to just take over and take over her life one word off is Antichrist one word off is anti- but if you're just word upon word and you become the word as you hear the word until you are the fullness all the bride together the fullness of God made bodily and you you see how you can just you keep repeating that to somebody don't you realize who you are don't you realize who you are but when God reveals it to you it's different then it it's different than somebody just telling it to you over and over again true look at that Antichrist spirit Spirit working to come against the movement of the Holy Ghost and that in that early church age the nickan spirit and we're just kind of kind of maybe hurrying through some of these things here as we're about to close that nickan Spirits brother R said never mind what God's word says you can't understand it we have to interpret it to you but you think about you can understand amen God wants to reveal himself to you think about that nician Spirit coming against coming against the liberty of the holy ghost moving in people's lives to make them think they couldn't understand it when you can understand it and you can have a direct relationship with God he said they oppressed the People by Leading them into and binding them to organization based upon the Creeds and Dogma which they taught the people instead of the pure word of God sir you know it's the clergy's job to hold the word over the people it's the clergy's job the the the preacher's job to preach the word and and then watch God do the rest it's it's not my job to make somebody repent it's my job to preach the word and then God will God will move on their heart and make them repent it's not my job to make somebody be a Christian I I could beat somebody over head with a rolled up newspaper all day long and it's not going to make them be a Christian it's my God to pre my my job to preach the word it's not my job to drag somebody to church but you watch the god get a hold of them and they'll be sitting there on the Pew and rejoicing along with everybody else it's our responsibility to preach the gospel and then do what watch God back it up because that's what the word the word the word was given to us to loose the spirit in our lives it's his Spirit that's doing the work it's the spirit that can change lives it's God that blesses amen but the devil has his false prophets oh yeah am I'm trying to get to a place here trying to run through my Andrew Glover can do this faster skip through his notes I'm not I'm not like that thank you thank you brother after the bride I think now after the bride is taken away that scripture we were reading then this man of sin will reveal himself am the spirit becomes greater and greater until it takes over but there's a little group that has packed away the word they've got plenty of fuel to keep the fire burning amen Amen brother round and you know when he was preaching pretty much all the seals he just kept constantly referring back to the to the the foolish virgin he said the bridegroom call went out in the seventh watch and then the sleeping virgin come rubbed her eyes and said suppose I ought to have some of that old too so maybe we'd better have some some of that some of that word that will loose the spirit the old is the spirit how you going to get the spirit the word it's the same it's all wrapped up together and the real true B bride standing there say we have just got enough for oursel we just got enough in to get in oursel we can't give you nothing if you want some you go pray up pray that God will reveal himself to you there's a real true bride that has loaded up with oil cuz she knows what that's going to do she's got a revelation of that power she loves the word she's in love with the word and she's it she it's doing something in her life so she loaded it up because she ain't foolish and she's made herself ready brother said the bride could go home and you never know nothing about it right he said that's true somebody said well brother Brown that would be a mighty small group if there was 800 winning the Rapture tonight you never hear a word about it tomorrow or the next day or no other time he said be ready watching every minute quick your quit your nonsense just get down to business with God because it's later than you think now if he could say that back then what can we say tonight that surely is later than we think that's the reason brother R said Christ has to stay on the mediatorial seat back there as an intercessor just hang on with me just for a few more moments we'll be closing in a minute until that last one comes in at the last stage and these Revelations then these Revelations then there at the last of what it has been breaks forth upon the people and they see what happened brother now that's what we're doing sitting here in church on a Wednesday night we're Longing To not just see what happened down through the seven Church ages but to see what's happened in our own lives now there's what's revealed in the Seven Seals when you look back and see what God has done God think about now that God wants you to see what happened amen that's what's going to give you Rapture in faith God wants you to remember remember all The Crucible the times of beating the strange things that were said the hurtful things remember all that your experience remember when you were first born again remember when you grew remember it just piling on remember how your character was changed to make you to make you his Queen that's why in Revelation chapter 6 verse one it says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see come come take a look at this right come and see come and see what God has made you come and see how God kicked the devil out come and see how God kicked the devil out of your life come and see how Satan is a bluff come and see how you ain't a bluff come and see how you stand for something and when you speak the word it actually does something now to think tonight about how if you're a real godall minister to know that the word that you speak will actually have an impact on people's Liv lies because you ain't a Blu to sit see there sitting there as as a real born again Christian to know that you're really a real borning in Christian because God has revealed it to you not just cuz somebody pumped you up and slapped you on the back and said a lot of good things about you to to know that you ain't a faker come and see come and see God is veiled in your flesh God veil in my flesh come and see the mystery of one God come and look into the book and see come and see that mystery of iniquity right away now that's what what do we want to see come and see the Queen of Heaven that's been made spotless by the lamb brother R said in the first seal he said some church today calls her the Queen of Heaven the Queen of Heaven is the selected bride of Christ and she comes with him and he started talking about that queen of Shea the queen of the South that would come up she she found she found what was really important in her life and she loaded up camels and went on a long J why cuz she knew that that word of God meant something to you and if you can look back in your life and remember how the word first gripped you and it kept gripping you and gripping you and changing you day by day just like that Queen when she got to the feet of Solomon and she'd listen to Solomon talking could you imagine sitting there and hearing the things coming out of Solomon's mouth and she my goodness where how does he know these things how does where did you get this kind of information and that's just how you and I are when we turn on the sermon sitting there in our car maybe when we wake up laying there at night you know sometimes I come down in the morning I hear my wife playing brother brandom and and you know it's it's just like that Queen of Sheba listening to to Solomon you hear the same wisdom because the same one that spoke through Solomon spoke through brother brandham and is speaking still speaking through his through the ministry today he said not even a Jew came up with that generation that was Jews yeah and they were blind and missed him there that great Queen humble herself and come and accepted the message and the Queen of Sheba wasn't foolish and you believe you believe tonight that that same one that spoke through Solomon that same one is still able to speak you know in the Book of Revelation so many people get confused by that that John actually he bowed down to that one that said I behold I come quickly and he said don't bow down to me and so many people get confused by you but you know he said I of thy Brethren the prophets and in the book of Hebrews it says that God many times and many ways spoke through the fathers through the prophets and you wouldn't bow down to a prophet but it was God speaking through him nonetheless and that same God that spoke through Solomon that same God spoke through Paul that same God spoke through brother Ram you wouldn't bow down to brother brandham or you wouldn't bow down to Solomon but it was God speaking through him nonetheless and that same God is still speaking in this day speaking through a five-fold Ministry if you could recognize it thank God that God has given us the ability to listen and to be able to hear and recognize and that it's not just a bunch of noise and not just a bunch of Thunder not just a bunch of clapping and rolling thunder but we can hear the voice of God when he speaks to us that Queen of Sheba wasn't foolish you know what foolish means it means a decision or behavior that lacks good sense judgment or wisdom and I tell you what lacks good what what I tell you what would make good sense is to follow after this word and cleave to it with everything that you got if you're not born again tonight run to it as quick as you can run to it and how how are you going to get born again tonight by the word how you going to get access to the blood of the Lamb by the word the blood the word is what gives us access to his Spirit brother R said remember when that foolish virgin went to buy oil when they come back the bride was done gone and the door was shut and they knocked and said let us in let us in but they were in outer Darkness cuz they were foolish all that time they were running around nor you see you'd have a lamp and then you'd have a little pouch that you'd fill up with oil and all that time they were running around thinking that they're that that they had what were they thinking you don't have any oil in your pouch you're not carrying it right iniquity iniquity to know and to know that you need to be born again you know that you must be born again amen you must be born again you must be born again don't let the devil tell you you can't have it it's your promise as the musicians come forward you must be born again I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquer and to conquer this fellow That's mighty mighty and his conquering power but how is he going to conquer with no errors you see the only weapon right that this guy has is has is his deception yep he's trying to deceive and the only way that you can combat that deception is by the word of God the word of God drives out the deception y right God bless you Saints let's stand to our feet and just wor Worship the [Applause] Lord am Lord [Music] I just sing it to him and now if you have a need

that we need to fight the enemy that when the Devil comes to you with all of his lies you've got the antidote now you think about that promise that brother BR said that one day there's going to come somebody that the devil won't know what to do with why why cuz they took God at his word amen and they just they just stayed right with his word and they separated themselves from everything contrary to God's word now so if you're battling and you're struggling with things just just speak God's word if God said it if you're if you're a born again Christian and you speak God's word then that's deity speaking and it ain't going to fall to the ground God's promises are going to be fulfilled you love the Lord tonight you don't have anything well let's just pray and then we'll be dismissed Lord
