[40:58] 19 I will go into them and I will praise

[41:09] art become my
[41:11] salvation the stone which the builders
[41:13] refused is become The Headstone of the
[41:15] corner this is the Lord's doing it is
[41:17] marvelous in our eyes this is the day
[41:20] day which the Lord hath made we will
[41:22] rejoice and be glad in it save now I
[41:25] beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord Lord I
[41:27] beseech thee send now
[41:30] Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in
[41:32] the name of the Lord now remember that's
[41:34] the scripture we've been reading because
[41:36] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[41:38] the Lord it it would if someone is
[41:40] coming in the name of the Lord then
[41:42] that's the Lord coming right they may be
[41:46] sending another one in a servant or a
[41:48] for but that's fine but that's still his
[41:50] coming see we have blessed you out of
[41:53] the house of the Lord now let's go over
[41:55] to Zechariah
[41:57] I hope you've been reading these uh
[42:00] scriptures and uh you know meditating on
[42:03] them and I know I'm very slow in my
[42:07] preaching but and also
[42:10] repetitive but
[42:12] I it took me a year and a half to finish
[42:15] the first grade not because I couldn't
[42:18] hear and all like that but that is one
[42:21] good point you know I had to learn it
[42:23] over and over and over but uh once you
[42:26] learn it 1+ 1 is still two algebra
[42:29] geometry trigonometry whatever it is
[42:32] it's still got one bases what 1 + 1
[42:35] equals two all
[42:37] right now we'll read in
[42:39] Zechariah and the angel that talked with
[42:41] me came again and wait me as a man that
[42:44] is wakened out of his sleep and he said
[42:46] unto me what seest thou and I said I
[42:49] have looked and behold a Candlestick all
[42:51] of gold with a bowl upon the top of it
[42:54] and set his seven lamps there own and
[42:56] seven potes to the seven lamps which are
[42:59] upon the top thereof the two olive trees
[43:02] by it one upon the right side of the
[43:03] bowl and the other upon the left side
[43:05] thereof so I answered and spake to the
[43:08] angel that talk with me saying what are
[43:10] these my Lord then the angel that talked
[43:13] with me answered and said unto me
[43:16] knowest thou not what these be and I
[43:18] said no my Lord then he answered and
[43:21] spake unto me saying this is the word of
[43:23] the Lord what is all of this what was
[43:25] these candlesticks and these olive trees
[43:28] and what are these all right he said he
[43:30] tells him what it is then he answered
[43:32] and spake unto me saying this is the
[43:35] word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying
[43:38] not by might nor by power but by my
[43:41] spirit sayth the Lord of hosts who art
[43:43] thou oh great Mountain before zerubu
[43:46] thou shal become a Plaine and he shall
[43:48] bring forth a headstone thereof with
[43:49] Grace with shoutings crying Grace Grace
[43:52] unto it moreover the word of the Lord
[43:54] came unto me saying the hands of zeru
[43:57] will have laid the foundation of his
[43:58] house his hands shall also finish it and
[44:04] thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts
[44:06] has sent me unto you now you'll know it
[44:09] when it's finished right for who ha
[44:12] despised the day of small things the
[44:14] prophet said God in
[44:16] Simplicity for they shall rejoice and
[44:19] see the plummet in the hand of jerub
[44:21] with those seven these are the eyes of
[44:24] the Lord which run to and fro through
[44:26] the whole Earth
[44:28] Earth then answered I and said unto him
[44:31] what are these two olive trees upon the
[44:33] right side of the Candlestick and upon
[44:35] the left side thereof and I answered and
[44:39] I answered again and said unto him what
[44:41] be these two Olive branches which
[44:44] brought the two which threw the two
[44:46] golden pipes into the golden oil out of
[44:50] themselves and he answered and said unto
[44:52] him knowest thou not what these be and I
[44:55] said no my Lord
[44:58] then said he these are the two anointed
[45:01] ones that stand by the lord of the whole
[45:04] earth you may be seated the Lord at his
[45:06] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[45:09] as I said the ones that were not here
[45:12] Wednesday get those and I hope there's a
[45:15] copy there's four four things there
[45:17] we're going to
[45:19] uh do a lot of reading today I hope to
[45:23] finish this morning but if not we won't
[45:25] worry about it
[45:30] now what were we what was the point we
[45:33] were trying to get across Wednesday
[45:36] okay
[45:39] now Moses was told in Exodus
[45:44] 25 about verse 31 I think it
[45:48] is and he was in also over in in um
[45:54] chapter is chapter 25:31 when he starts
[45:57] telling it you'll also find that over in
[46:00] Exodus U
[46:03] 37 but he was told to
[46:07] build a
[46:09] Candlestick now we know what the prophet
[46:11] has gave us the
[46:13] definition that it is not a candles
[46:16] stick because candles burn out all right
[46:21] but it is really called a lamp
[46:24] stand all right now in doing
[46:29] that he tells God tells
[46:33] Moses how to build
[46:35] it if you're looking there in Exodus 25
[46:39] you'll notice verse 40 it tells him says
[46:42] look that thou make them after their
[46:46] pattern which was showed thee in the
[46:49] mount all right now over in Hebrews 8
[46:54] and5 Paul refers back to the is and
[46:57] talks about how that Moses was told to
[47:01] make this lampstand Candlestick you know
[47:06] and bring it down now I told you
[47:10] Wednesday that the catch to what we need
[47:13] to see is
[47:15] that you for you to try to draw
[47:19] that he would have a horrible
[47:23] picture of trying to draw out what
[47:28] God told Moses cuz he told him to make
[47:32] uh shaes and branches and bowls and
[47:34] Knots which is B bubs and flowers and
[47:38] you got six branches here and six
[47:40] branches here and you got this to be
[47:42] done here and you got this to be done
[47:44] there and if you tried to draw that
[47:46] out You' go
[47:48] Haywire cuz you got bubs and you got um
[47:53] things made like pomegranates you got
[47:54] flowers in it you got all kind of things
[47:57] all right now that was what was told to
[48:00] Moses to build now to you that wasn't
[48:03] here if you're look on the back you'll
[48:05] see the uh seven uh lamp stand the the
[48:10] drawing you know that is made of the one
[48:13] that is uh the only one that I can find
[48:17] now there's others that are made uh you
[48:19] can buy them off of Internet you can
[48:21] order monora as they call them and uh
[48:25] like I told him Wednesday don't look up
[48:26] manora m a n o r right look up n m e n o
[48:30] r and you know but it's pronounced
[48:35] manora and in that is the the drawing of
[48:39] what Moses made you say well how do you
[48:42] know that was the one that Moses made
[48:45] because it fits what was told to
[48:49] build right and we went through that
[48:52] Wednesday I'm not trying to show you how
[48:54] intellect I am I'm sh trying to show you
[48:57] how perfect the word of God is all right
[49:01] so he W say we don't need intellect BL
[49:03] we need Revelation well let's hear your
[49:06] Revelation about the
[49:07] lampstands and all of the things you
[49:10] know if it don't fit what was draw
[49:12] they're made right all right so Moses
[49:15] doesn't go up there and build a whole
[49:17] bunch of bows you know build this build
[49:19] him a bowl build him build him a this
[49:21] building there he comes down and makes a
[49:25] lampstand and he makes makes it out of
[49:27] pure
[49:28] gold and it has no joints or nothing and
[49:33] it's solid one solid piece and I told
[49:36] you even if you think that you could
[49:37] screw out the middle and pour oil down
[49:39] in it I would forget that cuz it's one
[49:41] solid piece go ahead pour it in the
[49:43] bottom of the bowl and you know let it
[49:46] take care of but see Moses was told to
[49:49] build something
[49:50] natural all right to put in the
[49:54] temple okay now he was told to make
[49:58] cherubims but what did that do that only
[50:00] represented right he was to put a cherim
[50:03] over here and a chair them over here and
[50:06] with wings and all this that and the
[50:07] other and they were everything made out
[50:09] of gold it said it that David brought in
[50:11] 666 talet of gold a year and man we
[50:15] weighed it out done the best we could go
[50:17] the Old Testament give you 75 lbs to a
[50:19] talent and the new test to give you 200
[50:22] so you know you got a lot of weight
[50:23] there anyway but they made those things
[50:27] and Moses was told to build it after the
[50:30] pattern if he hadn't seen it he wouldn't
[50:32] have known how to build that's my point
[50:35] all right see but then once he got it
[50:37] built then everything
[50:39] therea must fall back to the pattern
[50:43] that was given
[50:45] him all right now if you'll notice in
[50:48] Reading in Exodus he doesn't mention L
[50:52] the uh the uh two olive
[50:55] trees he do doesn't mention that in in
[50:59] Exodus all right it's mentioned in in in
[51:05] Zachariah
[51:07] now the point I'm trying to get you to
[51:09] see is one man makes a natural
[51:12] thing but that is only a
[51:14] symbolic that he made so was it with the
[51:18] fact that you'd build a cherubim you'd
[51:20] build this and you'd build that and
[51:22] you'd put this there all of those is
[51:24] only symbolics
[51:27] you know something to look at all right
[51:30] but Zachariah picks it up and as
[51:33] Zachariah is is doing it he's looking at
[51:36] the lampstand that Moses made cuz
[51:40] zachariah's way on over P Moses right
[51:43] and he's over there and he can look back
[51:44] and see what Moses made but see
[51:48] Zachariah is told to build or to take
[51:51] this and and to put it there and what it
[51:55] is see then he the seven golden
[51:57] candlesticks we read in Zachariah okay
[52:01] but in Zachariah then he's talked about
[52:05] the two olive
[52:07] trees well if you made that out you'd
[52:09] have a tree over here and a tree over
[52:11] here two olive trees you know I mean you
[52:14] you would try to make things out but
[52:16] why the point of it is if I don't
[52:19] mention this about 10 more times today I
[52:22] want you to remember one thing the olive
[52:25] trees is where you get the olive oil
[52:28] from all right so it's showing you where
[52:31] you get the oil from now hold on to that
[52:34] for a few minutes all right trying to
[52:36] get up to where we're at in a hurry okay
[52:39] now but he's shown the two olive trees
[52:42] that Moses
[52:43] was you know you'd add two more olet
[52:46] trees to your drawing but that won't
[52:48] work why why fool with it Moses had
[52:50] already been using the Candlestick the
[52:53] lampstand for hundreds of years before
[52:55] Zachariah come on the scene they were
[52:58] already using it in the temple that was
[53:00] to be put in to there and they had more
[53:02] than just
[53:04] one one king that ordered 10 at one time
[53:07] I remember reading and they were more
[53:10] than just one and they were only like
[53:12] three according to record that was kept
[53:14] Burning uh 24 hours a day some of the
[53:17] others were actually put out right and
[53:20] you know and because the symbolics of
[53:22] what you're
[53:23] holding but now listen to what I'm
[53:26] getting that Zachariah sees that
[53:30] Candlestick that's what he's
[53:32] shown he's got it in front of him
[53:35] maybe maybe he's in the temple when you
[53:38] know our part because Zachariah the
[53:40] restoration of the temple cleaning off
[53:42] and getting ready Ezra Nehemiah
[53:44] all but that's what I was trying to get
[53:46] you to see Wednesday
[53:48] night that once Moses built the
[53:51] Candlestick the
[53:52] lampstand you don't have to make a whole
[53:55] bunch more drawings right right from
[53:57] then on you're getting the
[54:00] Revelation and Moses then saying one
[54:03] thing build a
[54:05] lampstand that lampstand was made it had
[54:09] holes down through all those pipes
[54:11] running down in to the
[54:13] bottom all right Moses does not tell in
[54:17] Exodus what to do to get it to burn and
[54:20] that was what I was trying to get you to
[54:21] see
[54:23] Wednesday olive oil have would have to
[54:26] be put into the hundreds of hundreds of
[54:29] degrees to be able to make it light
[54:32] right okay you you you know what I'm
[54:35] talking about oil like that is not
[54:38] gasoline we're not talking about
[54:40] kerosene we're not talking about uh coal
[54:43] oil we're not talking about you know gas
[54:46] Under
[54:47] Pressure we're talking
[54:50] about you know olive
[54:53] oil
[54:55] okay now H I told my why something the
[54:58] other day some of you probably never
[54:59] thought of it you're going to gasp when
[55:01] I say it but even
[55:06] gasoline it it it's got a problem most
[55:08] of the time it's put under pressure and
[55:09] then you light it but if you ever made a
[55:12] flambo out of a plastic jug with
[55:15] gasoline you know a burning light flambo
[55:17] burning
[55:18] light right you can take a h you can
[55:21] take a gallon jug cut it in half pour it
[55:24] full of gasoline except don't let it
[55:26] roll run over don't let it run out pour
[55:29] it down in there very
[55:30] carefully couple of inches deep you
[55:33] strike a match and just stick it to
[55:35] it you're not going to blow the world
[55:38] up you're only going to light the center
[55:41] of that
[55:43] gas try it sometimes see if I'm wrong
[55:46] just make sure now I said don't spill
[55:47] none around don't let it get into where
[55:50] the vapors and things of that pour it in
[55:52] real carefully and you can just light it
[55:54] and it just sit there and burn for hours
[55:56] the only way that'll burn the plastic is
[55:58] when the gasoline is finally burned
[56:00] out you know you can boil water in the
[56:03] plastic bag right sure all right but now
[56:06] listen what I'm trying to get you to see
[56:09] is Moses didn't tell all the whole story
[56:12] he only Built what God told him but he
[56:15] knew the rest of the story how do you
[56:17] get the olive oil up to the top to be
[56:20] able to burn it all right I gave you the
[56:22] quote from the prophet he said what you
[56:24] do you put a wick in it right am all
[56:27] right now we're old enough brother
[56:29] George and us are old enough to remember
[56:30] the old lamps you know and we were
[56:32] burning and and you put the coal oil
[56:34] down in the bottom and you know the
[56:36] kerosene and you you had to have a wick
[56:38] you didn't like the kerosene it wasn't
[56:40] burn that way right gas will but
[56:43] kerosene wouldn't burn right off you got
[56:45] to get it hot all right so you put a wit
[56:49] down
[56:50] through and it was made out of wool or
[56:53] some kind of flax see the best was wool
[56:57] and you put that down in there and then
[56:59] you can just light that thing well you
[57:01] know it'll just keep burning cuz it's
[57:02] drawing that oil up out of the bottom of
[57:04] the bowl well look at your Candlestick
[57:07] the things you're looking at you just
[57:08] let them run right down in there and you
[57:10] light it brother R said you're the wick
[57:12] right I gave you the quotes I'm trying
[57:14] to get in a hurry all right he said
[57:15] you're the wick he said the wick is a
[57:19] Believer and that believer has to be
[57:22] able to walk with the word right all
[57:25] right now and in doing that see it would
[57:28] come out to show you that you would need
[57:32] some situation or existence to get the
[57:35] oil from so Zachariah is shown what he
[57:39] said this is the word of the Lord unto
[57:45] zeru the seven golden candlesticks the
[57:48] the uh two olive trees is the word of
[57:50] the Lord to zeru now what's Zachariah s
[57:54] he s the seven churches ages because
[57:57] there's your liand that's right amen
[57:59] your laand is your church
[58:01] ages and he's showing that and he's
[58:04] showing him where the olive oil comes
[58:06] from all right now we'll get back to
[58:08] that in a minute but I'm just trying to
[58:09] to move over real fast and not lose
[58:11] those that were not here but remember
[58:15] now Moses is not riding put a wick in it
[58:19] that was something else it came along
[58:21] right amen Moses is not talking about
[58:25] two olive trees that's something else
[58:27] that was coming
[58:29] on right that was things that would be
[58:33] brought into showing us the
[58:35] Revelation everybody understand what I'm
[58:37] saying now it would be something to show
[58:39] us the Revelation it continually
[58:42] unfolds because that lampstand back
[58:45] there was only to speak of the seven
[58:47] Church ages we'll get to it in a minute
[58:49] where the Prophet said they was seven in
[58:50] the old and seven in the new all right
[58:53] amen now so it shows the church edes
[58:57] it's showing I'm talking about the
[58:59] second coming of Jesus
[59:01] Christ what is the second coming the
[59:04] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[59:06] church all right that's what your
[59:08] Prophet says and it's been taking place
[59:12] since the day of Pentecost amen that's
[59:14] right well you mean the second coming
[59:16] well that's where he started amen that's
[59:18] right it's going to be finished in this
[59:19] age and the most wonderful thing because
[59:23] no age outside of this age that's right
[59:25] would ever
[59:27] understand how that the Revelations 1
[59:31] about 13 1213 that you'd see one
[59:34] standing in the midst of the seven
[59:35] golden candlesticks like unto the son of
[59:38] man G about the pouch which is women
[59:41] femish with a golden girl nobody could
[59:44] understand that until it's shown later
[59:46] see each one is unveiling it as each
[59:49] person sees it they're writing it like I
[59:52] said non he saw chariots josing in the
[59:55] street
[59:57] what do you see BU o mobiles running
[59:59] into each other down the highways
[1:00:01] running like lightning with torches in
[1:00:03] other words let have on that's what your
[1:00:06] Prophet said he saw he saw this day but
[1:00:09] how could he describe it chariots
[1:00:12] droping in the streets Ezekiel said he
[1:00:14] saw fire falling down out of Heaven
[1:00:16] nuclear destruction right he saw a wheel
[1:00:20] in the middle of the wheel draw that big
[1:00:22] old wheel Brother D With A Little Wheel
[1:00:24] in the middle yeah what do you mean
[1:00:28] you got two wheels what are you talking
[1:00:30] about see the Bible is unveiling the
[1:00:34] revelation of
[1:00:36] God that's why I preach that message
[1:00:38] there how that his coming is revealed in
[1:00:41] the Bible the prophet in Christ of
[1:00:43] mystery said it's revealed in every
[1:00:44] verse right all right now is everybody
[1:00:47] caught up a little bit from Sunday that
[1:00:49] missed that I mean Wednesday to where we
[1:00:51] can go on see Zachariah then is shown
[1:00:56] the candlesticks we got that the
[1:00:59] lampstand okay now he picks up in verse
[1:01:02] three he's shown two olive
[1:01:06] trees what is God showing Zachariah the
[1:01:10] word of the Lord amen all and what is he
[1:01:14] showing him where does the lamp get the
[1:01:17] olive
[1:01:18] oil from The Olive Tree amen and there's
[1:01:23] two of them you said well I understand
[1:01:24] that brother Dale that's most mes and
[1:01:26] Elijah
[1:01:28] okay that's all right but is that all of
[1:01:32] it is that all you
[1:01:35] see is that will that fulfill all of the
[1:01:38] things in the Bible or just Moses and
[1:01:42] Elijah because remember Moses and Elijah
[1:01:46] is to come after the Rapture so now what
[1:01:49] are we supposed to talk about okay now I
[1:01:52] want you to notice something
[1:01:56] I want you to read it here in in in
[1:02:00] Zechariah and then I want to turn over
[1:02:02] to the Book of Revelation chapter 11 so
[1:02:05] we'll pick up on these two ol trees
[1:02:08] now look in Zechariah
[1:02:13] 4 and
[1:02:17] 14 then said he these are the two
[1:02:21] anointed
[1:02:23] ones that stand by i
[1:02:28] y the lord of the whole
[1:02:31] earth now I tell you A lot of times I
[1:02:33] try to give you secrets and try to help
[1:02:35] you and and I don't believe you get it
[1:02:38] when I say write this
[1:02:42] down you
[1:02:44] know now like in
[1:02:47] school you know okay now when he in
[1:02:51] school and the teacher come
[1:02:54] along and the the teacher went through
[1:02:56] the book
[1:02:58] going you know
[1:03:02] read but it was your book and the
[1:03:05] teacher told you said if I was
[1:03:08] you I'd underline that word right there
[1:03:12] right right now you went to school right
[1:03:15] especially College people right
[1:03:19] now what do you mean well all
[1:03:22] of that she read was what was said in
[1:03:24] that one word
[1:03:27] right remember that one
[1:03:29] word so you're going to have a key so
[1:03:32] you don't have to remember I it said
[1:03:33] when the test come by you write down
[1:03:35] that one
[1:03:37] word now that's what I try to get you to
[1:03:39] see here the other day I said I said I'm
[1:03:43] going to say this four
[1:03:46] times how many remember what I said I
[1:03:49] was going to say four times in one
[1:03:53] sermon I want you to write it down
[1:03:56] am the quote was
[1:04:00] what that you'll never any be any closer
[1:04:05] to the fulfilling of God being visible
[1:04:08] Among
[1:04:09] Us than the headstone coming to the
[1:04:13] church right and how many of you wrote
[1:04:15] it down and thought on
[1:04:19] that that'll be very valuable about two
[1:04:21] messages
[1:04:22] later see I try to get you to see
[1:04:25] something the Bible run around and said
[1:04:27] don't have to be
[1:04:29] corrected he said it says what it means
[1:04:31] it means what it says right okay now
[1:04:34] Zachariah said these two anointed
[1:04:38] ones
[1:04:40] stand by B
[1:04:43] why Circle that b why okay now let's go
[1:04:48] over to Revelations and read
[1:04:51] it and you'll see that brother Dale is
[1:04:54] not an intellect he preaches by
[1:04:56] Revelation amen but you got to have the
[1:05:00] Revelation there's only one way to get
[1:05:02] it by the intellect that's right and you
[1:05:04] tell me how you're going to get it
[1:05:05] without it first being
[1:05:07] intellect okay so look at Revelations
[1:05:13] 11 verse three and I give power unto my
[1:05:16] two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[1:05:20] 1,23 score days clothed in
[1:05:24] sackcloth the these are the two olive
[1:05:27] trees now what two olive trees the two
[1:05:30] olive trees that Zachariah
[1:05:32] saw
[1:05:34] okay but once these are the two olive
[1:05:37] trees and the two
[1:05:43] candlesticks and Zachariah on is saw one
[1:05:49] Candlestick so added Revelation is
[1:05:52] coming two candlesticks
[1:05:55] but he keeps the two olive trees look
[1:05:58] where it's at though these are the two
[1:06:00] olive trees and the two
[1:06:02] candlesticks standing
[1:06:06] before not by
[1:06:12] right
[1:06:15] before the god of the
[1:06:17] earth well brother Dale that's just some
[1:06:20] two
[1:06:21] witnesses cuz that's what you're reading
[1:06:23] right there the two witnesses yeah try
[1:06:25] to draw
[1:06:27] that draw what is shown in the Book of
[1:06:29] Revelations and you got two candlesticks
[1:06:33] and you got two olive
[1:06:36] trees but why worry about that just
[1:06:39] think about adding God adding Revelation
[1:06:42] it's like Moses added a wick to bring
[1:06:45] the olive oil up into the top where you
[1:06:48] could light the
[1:06:51] wick the olive oil will only go into the
[1:06:54] wick and you light the wick and it draws
[1:06:57] the olive oil up through right that's
[1:07:00] your life I'm trying to show you the
[1:07:03] candlesticks the lampstands and seeing
[1:07:05] that it is Jesus Christ in the bride
[1:07:08] okay but now
[1:07:10] look how can this be fulfilled that one
[1:07:13] man sees him standing the two ol trees
[1:07:16] sees them standing by the
[1:07:18] Lord the other one sees it standing
[1:07:21] before the
[1:07:22] Lord now where in the scriptures can you
[1:07:24] find two olive trees standing by the
[1:07:30] Lord so you better find out what the
[1:07:32] olive trees
[1:07:33] are
[1:07:35] okay now keep in
[1:07:38] mind what does that
[1:07:42] mean I'm not being sarcastic nor hateful
[1:07:45] I'm trying to get you to
[1:07:49] think keep in
[1:07:51] mind Moses built what God showed him
[1:07:55] right but God didn't show him that that
[1:07:59] was the church ages God didn't show him
[1:08:02] the two ol trees God didn't show him the
[1:08:06] bride standing in the candlesticks those
[1:08:08] were things that unveiled as it's going
[1:08:11] on
[1:08:13] right like the the uh uh
[1:08:17] cherubims and cherubims wound up to be
[1:08:20] Angels later then Chans wound up to be
[1:08:23] preachers then Chans wind up to be
[1:08:27] people
[1:08:30] see see what Moses saw in the mount he
[1:08:36] built right now we asked the prophet
[1:08:40] because only by way of the Prophet can
[1:08:42] we get the symbolics right you agree y
[1:08:46] oh we got this
[1:08:48] symbol the uh I can show you go to
[1:08:50] scoffield and scoffield said that these
[1:08:53] two olive trees was was the two two
[1:08:55] witnesses over in Revelation because he
[1:08:57] could run the
[1:08:59] scripture you think he
[1:09:02] understood the denominations teach uh
[1:09:05] Revelation 6 that the six seal as a
[1:09:08] tribulation period do you think they
[1:09:10] know what that
[1:09:15] is so you can read Natural Things once
[1:09:18] you get a key you can just go from one
[1:09:20] to the other so if you got over here two
[1:09:23] olive trees and Zar you got two olive
[1:09:26] trees in the Book of Revelations and you
[1:09:28] say hey that must be the same too and
[1:09:31] these two are the two witnesses going to
[1:09:33] Israel so hey we got it well now do you
[1:09:36] have all of
[1:09:39] it remember these two over here are
[1:09:42] standing
[1:09:47] before they're not standing
[1:09:50] by the
[1:09:52] Lord okay all right prophet it we have
[1:09:55] to ask you we know by your understanding
[1:10:00] that
[1:10:01] Zachariah Moses this only put it formed
[1:10:04] as a top of it Zachariah begin to unfold
[1:10:08] unto us to be able to see uh the
[1:10:11] candlesticks and how they would
[1:10:12] represent things and then uh the seven
[1:10:18] over in the Book of Revelations you
[1:10:19] would pick up and you would find the the
[1:10:22] revelations one that there was the seven
[1:10:24] golden candlesticks and you'd find out
[1:10:26] that the scripture says that that is the
[1:10:28] church down through the seven Church
[1:10:30] ages that by the spirit of God all right
[1:10:33] so Zachariah know what he was talking
[1:10:35] about he saw it as the word of the Lord
[1:10:37] coming to zerubabel which zerubabel is a
[1:10:40] Tope of the end time messenger is what
[1:10:42] your Prophet said to bring the word of
[1:10:44] the Lord unto you and I right all right
[1:10:47] so we're taking the prophet's
[1:10:51] definition and putting it right back in
[1:10:54] Scripture it's all right
[1:10:56] now we have seen the church ages and
[1:10:59] what they
[1:11:00] are okay
[1:11:03] now the
[1:11:05] prophet gave us some great
[1:11:08] understandings if we would just follow
[1:11:09] those understandings so right now
[1:11:11] prophet of God what are these two olive
[1:11:16] trees well quote wait a minute let me
[1:11:19] get over a little further before you get
[1:11:21] there
[1:11:25] look what your Prophet had to say now
[1:11:27] we'll start reading some of our notes
[1:11:28] and if I have to I'll take this evening
[1:11:31] on this I don't worry about it so long
[1:11:33] as you get it we'll repeat it and if you
[1:11:35] got questions and answers we'll have
[1:11:37] that
[1:11:37] too I want you to see what I'm talking
[1:11:40] about right cuz only by seeing what it's
[1:11:43] talking about can you understand the
[1:11:45] Revelation well we don't need that all
[1:11:47] we need to know seven Church a represent
[1:11:49] right well did you know that before the
[1:11:51] prophet said it no well then the prophet
[1:11:53] said a lot of other things right amen
[1:11:55] amen so we need to know
[1:11:58] that now watch what your Prophet said on
[1:12:01] number 14 of your notes and watch him
[1:12:03] how how he's got this because over in in
[1:12:06] Zachariah you've got two olive
[1:12:10] trees and one lamp
[1:12:13] stand one
[1:12:16] Candlestick go back and read it but in
[1:12:19] Revelations you've got that we've just
[1:12:21] read verse 4 114

[1:12:29] two
[1:12:31] candlesticks so now you got two
[1:12:33] candlesticks well brother random what
[1:12:35] does those two candlesticks mean we know
[1:12:38] you have told us the two olive trees are
[1:12:41] the Moses and Elijah right but see you

[1:12:47] explaining about these two candlesticks
[1:12:50] CU they don't know what it
[1:12:52] means brother random what does it mean

[1:13:01] Old Testament if the Lord will maybe in
[1:13:03] the coming Services I'd like to show how
[1:13:06] that the seven Church ages tyed out in
[1:13:09] the Old Testament how that they begun
[1:13:12] just exactly like at the beginning of
[1:13:15] the church ages of the Gentile church
[1:13:18] and went down through a similar Dark Age
[1:13:22] and come out into the Glorious time of
[1:13:25] Pentecost now he's talking about Old
[1:13:27] Testament all right I remember one time
[1:13:29] he was talking about Pentecost he said
[1:13:31] can't you see maram uh taking their
[1:13:33] tambourine and running down beside when
[1:13:35] they had conquered and went across and
[1:13:36] Miriam running along speaking in
[1:13:38] tongues he said you can coming down to
[1:13:41] the Pentecostal age he said talking
[1:13:43] about the coming to the Pentecost at the
[1:13:46] falling of the Holy Ghost in the new in
[1:13:48] the early church and then coming out
[1:13:50] Jewish dispensation all right now let's
[1:13:52] go on Matthew two or three Witnesses
[1:13:58] let's go down to the next one so we'll
[1:14:00] tie it all together patas
[1:14:04] Vision paragraph 153 196 1204 evening I
[1:14:10] just give you what's underlines you read
[1:14:12] the rest of it to make sure it's right
[1:14:14] he talks about the prophet sees it in a
[1:14:15] vision what does he see the two olive
[1:14:17] trees now what kind of what did they
[1:14:21] burn in those lamps in the Bible times
[1:14:24] does anybody anyone know oil what kind
[1:14:27] of oil olive oil two olive trees what is
[1:14:31] it the old the new and the Old Testament
[1:14:35] standing by
[1:14:39] it not
[1:14:41] before the old and the New
[1:14:45] Testament you said well how's it old how
[1:14:47] can it be old and new testament I
[1:14:50] thought it was just the two
[1:14:52] prophets cuz the old and the New
[1:14:54] Testament is where you going to get the
[1:14:55] oil from and the oil is the Holy Ghost
[1:14:59] am
[1:15:01] right all right so we're getting some
[1:15:03] keys to be able to understand a little
[1:15:07] bit going down to number 16 page 50 of
[1:15:12] the patmas vision which is 50 of the
[1:15:14] church age book He's explaining these
[1:15:16] two olive trees and what they
[1:15:19] are and he says it is Burning Brightly
[1:15:22] because it has plenty of oil which it's
[1:15:25] getting from the two olive trees now
[1:15:28] watch where he's getting it from which
[1:15:29] stand on either side see by the Lord
[1:15:34] Zachariah okay the two trees represent
[1:15:38] the Old and New Testament and of course
[1:15:41] the oil simplifies the Holy
[1:15:45] Ghost well now brother
[1:15:47] Dale you read one in invasion of the US
[1:15:50] in 54 so brother randam in 54 he just
[1:15:53] understood that it was you know was Old
[1:15:56] and New Testament well if I was you I'd
[1:15:58] go check the year the church AE book
[1:16:00] came out because the church AE book I
[1:16:02] just read out of in page 50 was only put
[1:16:04] out in
[1:16:08] 65 so don't say well that was he had
[1:16:10] this and he had
[1:16:13] that who alone can give light the light
[1:16:16] of God to the people the angel who spoke
[1:16:19] in Zechariah was as much as saying this
[1:16:22] is what you see means that the the
[1:16:25] church cannot accomplish anything by its
[1:16:27] own might or power but by the Holy Ghost
[1:16:30] right amen for that amen all right now
[1:16:34] but brother
[1:16:36] brandom you go on now to continue the
[1:16:39] understanding and what are you saying
[1:16:43] it where do you get the oil he said from
[1:16:47] the two candle the two olive trees and
[1:16:51] the two olive trees is the Old and New
[1:16:52] Testament you get anything outside the
[1:16:54] old and new Testament what do you got
[1:16:56] garbage can right what do you got man's
[1:16:58] interpretation what do you got
[1:17:02] denominationalism because you'll sputter
[1:17:04] and splat and won't work because it's
[1:17:06] not pure olive oil right pure olive oil
[1:17:09] will only come from the Old and New
[1:17:12] Testament does everybody understand that
[1:17:15] partner right do we need to stay on that
[1:17:17] cuz I can stay on it the rest of the day
[1:17:18] it doesn't matter to me I just want to
[1:17:20] make sure you understand do you
[1:17:23] understand the two Al Tru Prest
[1:17:25] represents the old and the New
[1:17:27] Testament well I just thought it meant
[1:17:29] Moses and Elijah well where does Moses
[1:17:32] and Elijah get their oil to bring to the
[1:17:36] church you know the 144,000 after the
[1:17:40] Rapture they get it from the old and the
[1:17:42] New Testament because by that time there
[1:17:45] will be an old and a new testament
[1:17:48] that's why that it's represented in the
[1:17:51] point of the opening of the word that
[1:17:52] there was seven candlesticks in the old
[1:17:54] test test there's seven in the new there
[1:17:57] was a bride in the Old Testament there
[1:17:59] is a bride in the New
[1:18:02] Testament right and they stand by the
[1:18:06] Lord yeah so brother randam let's
[1:18:09] continue on
[1:18:10] now where is it or what is it that we
[1:18:13] can
[1:18:14] see about these two

[1:19:57] what I'm
[1:19:58] saying now you tell me you can I tell
[1:20:01] you
[1:20:03] can't but now
[1:20:05] listen can't we see
[1:20:08] then that Zachariah is shown three
[1:20:11] things
[1:20:14] y he
[1:20:20] shown lampstand he looks back to Moses
[1:20:23] he sees it he shown two olive
[1:20:26] trees showing Zachariah where the oil
[1:20:29] was going to come from was from the
[1:20:31] olive trees right which would be the
[1:20:34] word of
[1:20:35] God all then he
[1:20:38] shown something to take up another
[1:20:43] step he's shown where that's
[1:20:46] at he shown that it's going to be in the
[1:20:48] Bri
[1:20:51] right now he might not have understood
[1:20:54] all he was talking talking about about
[1:20:55] the bride but yet he was understanding
[1:20:58] right
[1:21:00] right now we can see then that Moses and
[1:21:03] Elijah can be the two olive trees we see
[1:21:07] then that the
[1:21:10] uh Old and New Testament is the two
[1:21:13] olive trees
[1:21:16] right now we are the
[1:21:19] bride the
[1:21:21] wick that burns in the light of the age
[1:21:24] that were living to bring light to the
[1:21:26] world right okay we must get that from
[1:21:29] the two olive
[1:21:31] trees so we don't get all we get from
[1:21:34] The Book of Revelations right we get the
[1:21:37] whole
[1:21:38] book
[1:21:39] right we're the only people that
[1:21:42] understand that we get the old and the
[1:21:44] New Testament you know you were told
[1:21:46] don't read Genesis cuz you can't
[1:21:48] understand it don't read Revelation
[1:21:50] because it's too much in symbolics
[1:21:55] brother R said the reason the devil
[1:21:56] don't want you to read those things is
[1:21:58] because Genesis shows his beginning and
[1:22:00] Revelation shows his
[1:22:02] ending he don't want you to understand
[1:22:05] that right he don't want you to
[1:22:09] understand the lampstands and the two
[1:22:11] witnesses right and the old and the New
[1:22:14] Testament because it was
[1:22:16] what now old and
[1:22:19] new so now you got two olive
[1:22:22] trees now the old and the the New
[1:22:28] Testament let me put this ahead of
[1:22:31] time the old and the New Testament
[1:22:34] understood in the correct
[1:22:36] order will
[1:22:38] be standing by the lord of the
[1:22:43] earth
[1:22:45] Zechariah The Book of Revelation said
[1:22:47] it's standing
[1:22:51] before so I'd hang on to that by for a
[1:22:53] minute
[1:22:57] now brother
[1:23:03] random where is there a
[1:23:07] place that this can all be
[1:23:11] fulfilled the Zechariah could see one
[1:23:14] lampstand and two ol trees and
[1:23:15] Revelation can see two olive trees and
[1:23:19] two
[1:23:20] lampstands one could say it was by the
[1:23:23] Lord the other one could
[1:23:25] say it was
[1:23:29] before we know for a certainty that the
[1:23:32] lamp stands would represent Israel as
[1:23:35] well as the bride because Israel was the
[1:23:38] Bride of the Old Testament she had seven
[1:23:41] Church ages I wish I could place all of
[1:23:43] them there's only just a few that
[1:23:45] brother brandham covers like I did there
[1:23:47] a minute ago you know that that showing
[1:23:49] it all right but he's the one that says
[1:23:51] it all right now notice something real
[1:23:58] careful okay cuz it has always bothered
[1:24:01] me you remember the other week I told
[1:24:03] you some things that bothered
[1:24:06] me it always bothered me how that the
[1:24:10] two olive trees would be the two
[1:24:13] witnesses but yet I knew the prophet had
[1:24:16] said that the two olive trees would
[1:24:19] be the Old and New Testament
[1:24:26] all right then the key come into being
[1:24:28] that the two being the old and the New
[1:24:30] Testament would be as Zachariah saw
[1:24:32] it by the
[1:24:35] Lord now was not his arm stretched at
[1:24:38] Calvary right for what
[1:24:42] reason the old and the New Testament
[1:24:45] right right amen are you with
[1:24:50] me I knew that it represented that I
[1:24:53] knew Zachariah said that this is the
[1:24:55] word of the
[1:24:57] Lord
[1:24:59] unable well we knew then after catching
[1:25:02] the message and coming into it that our
[1:25:04] dependence would be upon zerubabel as to
[1:25:07] be who he would be that it would be the
[1:25:09] end time
[1:25:10] messenger that would bring us to
[1:25:15] Revelation and the key was as I told you
[1:25:19] before when I read the Bible the first
[1:25:22] time in the Baptist Church and really
[1:25:23] reading it for me myself got converted
[1:25:25] 1958 in the Baptist
[1:25:29] Church and I began to read the
[1:25:32] Bible and when I came to Malachi 3 and
[1:25:34] Malachi 4 I told my wife I said
[1:25:37] according to the Bible here there'll be
[1:25:38] two prophets come before the end of the
[1:25:41] world I had not heard of The Prophet's
[1:25:43] message at that time I was only reading
[1:25:46] what the letter
[1:25:47] says but I always believed in Reading
[1:25:50] what the letter says these people talk
[1:25:53] about it already between the lines
[1:25:55] brother Dale yeah but if it's different
[1:25:57] from what's on the line then it's not
[1:26:01] right what's between the line cannot be
[1:26:04] anything different that's what I'm
[1:26:05] trying to get you to see Moses built
[1:26:07] exactly what God Said then God could add
[1:26:10] to Zachariah and understanding to open
[1:26:12] up to see more that it was the word of
[1:26:14] the Lord coming down through the people
[1:26:18] right who was the coming of the lord of
[1:26:20] the Old Testament oh Jesus Christ but it
[1:26:23] took Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph
[1:26:26] Masterpiece I'm quoting to build a
[1:26:28] foundation look at that Foundation
[1:26:30] exactly what you're looking at that
[1:26:32] drawing on the pyramids you got a
[1:26:33] foundation there on I mean the drawing
[1:26:35] on your Candlestick you got a
[1:26:38] foundation he said but the prophets
[1:26:40] built the body so look at the body being
[1:26:42] built in the Old Testament but finally
[1:26:44] Hebrews 10:5 finally a body came into
[1:26:47] being was produced by the Old Testament
[1:26:50] I thought we believe that the New
[1:26:51] Testament would start off with the
[1:26:52] foundation Apostles and proph Jesus
[1:26:55] Christ being the Chief Cornerstone and
[1:26:57] that's why the book of Acts would be the
[1:26:58] foundation our standard right all right
[1:27:02] and then we would start through the
[1:27:03] church ages to bring the church
[1:27:05] ages and the theight in the end time of
[1:27:08] the church ages would would be that God
[1:27:10] would send Elijah so I asked brother mod
[1:27:13] I said what does that mean when he begin
[1:27:15] to talk to me about the message of the
[1:27:17] hour of Miki 4 I said well who's Malachi
[1:27:22] 3 he said well glad let you ask that I'm
[1:27:25] glad I run into a man that know the
[1:27:27] scriptures cuz always love to read and
[1:27:31] when he began to tell me the scriptures
[1:27:32] and telling me in Luke 1:7 how that John
[1:27:36] the Baptist was to come and fulfill and
[1:27:38] turn the hearts of the the the Old
[1:27:40] Testament people toward toward the New
[1:27:42] Testament message
[1:27:44] see and then he would tell me there and
[1:27:48] I could read the Bible that it didn't go
[1:27:50] on and say that that same Elijah turned
[1:27:52] him back and brother said see there if
[1:27:55] he did cuz that's what I asked him I
[1:27:57] said you know did it turn back he said
[1:28:00] cuz see that's what it was taught in
[1:28:01] organization if you read that scripture
[1:28:03] where it says and the disobedient unto
[1:28:05] the something they'll use that scripture
[1:28:07] there in Luke 1:17 and they'll say well
[1:28:09] see there he turned him right back
[1:28:11] brother Mo said if he turned him back
[1:28:12] said he turned him back to the Old
[1:28:13] Testament said where would you have
[1:28:15] salvation said John turned him from the
[1:28:17] Old Testament to the new right said this
[1:28:20] Prophet has to turn us back to the faith
[1:28:22] of the father amen I said thank you I
[1:28:24] got the scriptures right that's right I
[1:28:26] knew who the two prophets were not two
[1:28:29] what was it Spirit of Elijah spirit amen
[1:28:31] okay
[1:28:33] now but the old and the New Testament
[1:28:36] stands in a perfect position because it
[1:28:38] stands on either side of the of the god
[1:28:41] of
[1:28:42] Glory right but Z but Revelation says
[1:28:47] that they stand before well now
[1:28:49] according to my understanding is I'm
[1:28:51] walking over to them on tape and I'm
[1:28:53] looking at something out here in front
[1:28:54] of me that means it's before
[1:28:57] me that little thing there that holds
[1:28:59] where they sing from it's before
[1:29:03] me all of them instruments are before
[1:29:08] me but see that wouldn't give the
[1:29:12] idea so where in the Bible can you read
[1:29:15] a a position or a
[1:29:19] situation right where can you read a
[1:29:22] situation in the Bible
[1:29:24] to verify that the old and the New
[1:29:26] Testament was standing beside the Lord
[1:29:28] do you
[1:29:29] know write it
[1:29:32] down write down your answer
[1:29:39] CA this was a thing I told you that
[1:29:43] always wondered about the old and the
[1:29:44] New
[1:29:45] Testament and the two
[1:29:48] witnesses but there was more that I
[1:29:50] wondered
[1:29:52] about I wondered about something that
[1:29:54] happened in the
[1:29:57] Bible go to Matthew
[1:30:00] 17
[1:30:02] okay and let's
[1:30:16] read you got
[1:30:18] it and after 6 days Jesus taketh Peter
[1:30:21] James and John his brother and bring
[1:30:24] them up into a high mountain
[1:30:27] apart
[1:30:29] okay and was
[1:30:31] transfigured transformed in other words
[1:30:34] before them and his face did shine as
[1:30:36] the sun and his rment was white as the
[1:30:39] light and behold there appeared unto
[1:30:42] them Moses and Elias talking with
[1:30:50] him now you see I know what this
[1:30:52] scripture means
[1:30:56] your Prophet knew what it meant
[1:31:01] too let's read what he
[1:31:06] said look back at your
[1:31:14] notes see we take Matthew 17 as speaking
[1:31:18] of
[1:31:19] adoption and hear ye
[1:31:21] him right this is my beloved son in whom
[1:31:24] I please to dwell here ye him that's
[1:31:26] what we
[1:31:28] cover but that's not the right angle of
[1:31:30] the
[1:31:32] scripture that's not the right sense
[1:31:34] that it's
[1:31:39] in let's
[1:31:42] read number 19 on your notes Here your
[1:31:45] hymn
[1:31:47] 1958
[1:31:48] 0301 and he's going to preach on
[1:31:50] adoption but watch
[1:31:52] it and now we could take a lengthy time
[1:31:55] on this and we could take it from many
[1:31:57] different
[1:31:59] angles truly the right angle to take
[1:32:03] this from is by way way of the second
[1:32:07] coming of the
[1:32:10] Lord you see where I've been preaching
[1:32:12] for 15 sermons to get to this okay so
[1:32:16] listen today
[1:32:18] please I got something in there if you
[1:32:20] need it laying on my desk
[1:32:24] if you need something to keep you
[1:32:30] awake it's a piece of pepper about that
[1:32:35] long did you want to go eat it I'm sure
[1:32:38] you won't go to
[1:32:40] sleep
[1:32:44] okay now
[1:32:47] watch that right angle to take this from
[1:32:49] is by way of the second coming of the
[1:32:51] Lord but brother Dale it's it's only
[1:32:56] adoption hold your point and
[1:33:00] listen you out there that hear it hold
[1:33:03] your point and listen read what your
[1:33:05] Prophet
[1:33:08] says he knew this was the order of the
[1:33:11] second
[1:33:13] coming he knew
[1:33:16] it that's what he's saying and perhaps
[1:33:19] maybe your pastor has taught you this
[1:33:21] many times on how that the order of the
[1:33:25] scripture how perfect it
[1:33:28] is the second coming of the
[1:33:32] Lord first the Moses and Elijah and then
[1:33:36] he looked and saw just Jesus only all
[1:33:39] for shattering or picturing the coming
[1:33:41] of the Lord the second time but tonight
[1:33:44] we want to approach it from another
[1:33:45] angle so he goes to
[1:33:48] adoption okay look at the next one here
[1:33:50] ye himn 58 328
[1:33:54] so we find him here going up to the
[1:33:56] Mount as we call it Mount
[1:34:00] Transfiguration always like to look at
[1:34:02] it in the real
[1:34:04] sense that it is wrote
[1:34:06] in look
[1:34:09] at that most all ministering Brethren
[1:34:12] approaches it as a type of the second
[1:34:16] coming of the Lord and that is
[1:34:20] true but there is not one scripture in
[1:34:24] the entire Bible but what will dovetail
[1:34:26] and connect with the next scripture
[1:34:28] every bit of it every bit it is one
[1:34:33] great big picture all the way from the
[1:34:36] Garden of Eden and the way of Calvary
[1:34:38] back to the Garden of Eden just one
[1:34:40] beautiful
[1:34:41] picture talking about a jigsaw puzzle
[1:34:44] down below
[1:34:47] it all right
[1:34:56] let's read number 21 while you
[1:34:59] have
[1:35:02] 1955
[1:35:07] 225 Jesus had just been taking Peter and
[1:35:10] James and John they went up in a
[1:35:13] mountain to show the coming of the Lord
[1:35:16] he
[1:35:16] said now notice what he
[1:35:19] said to show the coming of the Lord he
[1:35:22] said some stand here shall not see death
[1:35:26] until they see the kingdom of God coming
[1:35:28] in
[1:35:30] power now the only one that saw that was
[1:35:32] John
[1:35:34] right come on your Prophet said that
[1:35:37] John goes to patmas and sees the climax
[1:35:40] the coming of the Lord all
[1:35:42] right cuz he said there'd be some
[1:35:44] standing
[1:35:46] here and he went up and showed them just
[1:35:50] what would take place in the
[1:35:52] mount what what's going to take
[1:35:55] place the things pertaining to the
[1:35:57] second coming of the
[1:35:59] Lord and when they did the first thing
[1:36:02] they
[1:36:03] saw what did they see Jesus
[1:36:08] glorified that's the next thing the
[1:36:10] church will see here on Earth is the
[1:36:13] coming glorified Jesus amen number 37 on
[1:36:16] your notes at the end of it you'll find
[1:36:18] brother random saying on the Easter seal
[1:36:20] don't turn over and read it cuz we're
[1:36:22] going to read these other one that he
[1:36:24] says
[1:36:26] that glor the adoption glorifies Jesus
[1:36:30] Christ
[1:36:34] okay let's read on
[1:36:37] down here yeem 1957
[1:36:42] 5:19 and now as he comes and then this
[1:36:46] had another meaning to it I know many of
[1:36:48] you my brethren the clergymen you apply
[1:36:51] that to the coming of the Lord that's
[1:36:53] right night it was applied there the
[1:36:55] order of the coming Christ and they
[1:36:57] looked and they seen glorified Jesus
[1:37:00] they looked again and seen Moses and El
[1:37:03] the two witnesses Revelation 11 and they
[1:37:06] look back and seen Jesus only exact with
[1:37:08] the order order the the coming glorified
[1:37:12] Christ of preaching to the Jews then
[1:37:14] Jesus coming with his
[1:37:16] bride
[1:37:17] okay hear ye
[1:37:20] him 1957 807 and the real correct
[1:37:24] approach to this text tonight is the
[1:37:27] order of the second coming of Christ how
[1:37:30] that first he saw Jesus then Moses and
[1:37:32] Elijah and then Jesus only truly that is
[1:37:35] in perfect harmony with the second
[1:37:37] coming of Christ and he had said just
[1:37:40] previous to this many stand here that
[1:37:42] shall not see death till they see the
[1:37:45] son of man in his glory that was a
[1:37:47] prefigure of his coming in
[1:37:51] glory hear you him 196
[1:37:55] 3133 I believe as
[1:37:58] perhaps all
[1:38:02] ministers are many of them knows that
[1:38:04] this setting meant the coming the order
[1:38:07] of the coming of Christ the first thing
[1:38:09] they saw and how the order was they seen
[1:38:12] Jesus which was to appear then they seen
[1:38:15] the coming of the
[1:38:17] glorification and Jesus was to appear
[1:38:20] and then they seen the coming of the
[1:38:22] glorification and Moses and Elijah the
[1:38:24] very order of the second coming and when
[1:38:27] they look back they saw Jesus
[1:38:30] only trying to read to you a bunch what
[1:38:33] brother Rand had to say about
[1:38:43] it who is this Mel chz 1965

[1:38:58] the eagle in the Bible and there was a
[1:39:00] prophet named Moses and one day God
[1:39:02] called him and wouldn't let him go over
[1:39:04] the land and he he died on the Rock the
[1:39:06] Angels took him away and buried him
[1:39:08] there was another man an eagle didn't
[1:39:10] even have to die he just walked across
[1:39:12] Jordan and God sent a chariot down and

[1:39:31] hundreds of years but here he was in
[1:39:33] such a form till even Peter James and
[1:39:36] John recognized him amen if this Earthly

[1:41:16] wasn't which Jesus was referring back to
[1:41:20] something that happened Jesus Took Peter
[1:41:22] James and John and went up to the Mount
[1:41:24] Transfiguration one time and was
[1:41:25] standing on top of the mountain and
[1:41:27] Jesus who was placing his son like I'm
[1:41:30] trying to had the other night placing
[1:41:32] son and when they did they looked around
[1:41:35] and found out there
[1:41:37] stood Moses and Elijah they were talking
[1:41:41] communing not little white flags
[1:41:43] floating around or little white clouds
[1:41:45] rather floating around but they were men
[1:41:49] talking Moses had been buried in an
[1:41:51] unmarked grave for 800 years and Elijah
[1:41:54] went home in a chariot 500 years and
[1:41:57] here they both was till just as much
[1:42:00] alive as they were ever was alive
[1:42:02] standing there talking to him before he
[1:42:06] went to Calvary
[1:42:13] Hallelujah
[1:42:17] now he said with brother Dale
[1:42:23] why would that thrill you so
[1:42:31] much why would
[1:42:33] that uh break your
[1:42:39] heart we know about this we know about
[1:42:43] that we know about the two
[1:42:47] witnesses but you
[1:42:50] see this is the only place in the Bible
[1:42:55] that Moses and
[1:42:57] Elijah was standing not
[1:43:01] before but they were standing by the
[1:43:06] Lord John sees them later standing
[1:43:12] before Zachariah showed a beautiful
[1:43:14] picture right I not understood what it
[1:43:17] was all about but he says these are the
[1:43:20] two that stand by the Lord
[1:43:24] say well that's over there the second
[1:43:26] coming and all these that and the other
[1:43:28] see that's where you're tied up at
[1:43:30] that's where all of us was tied that's
[1:43:31] where I was tied that's why I couldn't
[1:43:36] understand sure I've preached on these
[1:43:38] things many times but if I was you I'd
[1:43:41] listen sometimes I've always tried to
[1:43:43] make the statement to you that when I
[1:43:45] preach something over again it's because
[1:43:47] I've received further
[1:43:49] Revelation not to reh hatch the same
[1:43:52] things because if you know I've never
[1:43:53] preached Daniel 70 weeks again if you
[1:43:55] notice I've never preached the seals
[1:43:57] again you know in an order of 1 2 3 4 I
[1:44:00] didn't feel it needed to
[1:44:02] be I'm trying to bring you something
[1:44:04] from my
[1:44:06] heart these two witnesses stand
[1:44:10] before the Lord at is
[1:44:12] coming I see you got his coming out you
[1:44:16] under you got his coming to
[1:44:20] Israel in the tribulation
[1:44:26] is that not
[1:44:30] true why would brother brandom take a
[1:44:33] thought like this and
[1:44:38] say I know this scripture here and I
[1:44:42] gave you quote after quote is talking of
[1:44:45] the second coming of the
[1:44:49] lord it's the order of the scriptures
[1:44:52] it's the placing of the scriptures he
[1:44:54] said he said I want to give you another
[1:44:57] point I want to use it in a little
[1:44:59] different way what's he talking
[1:45:05] about
[1:45:08] okay patas Vision
[1:45:11] 19612 1204 number 27 on your
[1:45:18] notes taken up to the mountain
[1:45:23] well back up above there he says
[1:45:24] everything had to be established in the
[1:45:26] mouth to three Witnesses so he took up
[1:45:27] Peter James and John for the three
[1:45:29] witnesses to see what was going on they
[1:45:32] take up Jesus on the mountain he take
[1:45:33] him up and he was transfigured before
[1:45:35] them transformed his realm and Shine
[1:45:36] Like the Sun in the middle of its
[1:45:38] strength and there appeared unto him
[1:45:39] Moses and
[1:45:41] Elijah what is this son of
[1:45:44] man coming in
[1:45:49] now the first will appear
[1:45:54] Moses and Elijah
[1:45:57] right okay keep
[1:46:00] reading and notice before Jesus returns
[1:46:03] to the earth now this is a little ahead
[1:46:06] of
[1:46:07] time but the spirit of
[1:46:10] Elijah will return back to the Earth and
[1:46:13] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:46:15] the fathers right the Bible said so
[1:46:18] Jesus saw him here
[1:46:24] are you reading Jesus saw him here the
[1:46:28] apostles saw him
[1:46:30] here the order of the coming of the son
[1:46:33] of man
[1:46:34] glorified he's to be glorified coming
[1:46:37] back first thing before they saw him
[1:46:39] what was what was what
[1:46:44] Elijah then what
[1:46:47] Moses Israel returning Yonder the
[1:46:50] lawkeepers and then the glorified son of
[1:46:53] man Hallelujah do you see the order of
[1:46:56] his coming the spirit of Elijah are the
[1:46:59] witness of the Life Church age see
[1:47:02] coming in power to manifest him
[1:47:06] right so what is Matthew 17 talking
[1:47:09] about the coming of the Lord that Elijah
[1:47:13] is going to come first
[1:47:16] right the number four time to the
[1:47:19] Gentile bride right remember he comes
[1:47:22] five times the other time he comes to
[1:47:25] Israel
[1:47:28] okay 70 weeks of Daniel 1961
[1:47:31] 806 he talking about the two prophets
[1:47:34] what they do Moses and Elijah they rise
[1:47:36] on the scene they'll tell those Jews
[1:47:37] they're mistake and out of that Jewish
[1:47:39] Bunch that there's now to be 144,000 God
[1:47:43] will call with these prophets what is it
[1:47:47] the spirit of Elijah off of this Gentile
[1:47:50] church amen will just continue right on
[1:47:54] into that Jewish Church go right on in
[1:47:57] and call Moses with
[1:48:00] him now brother brandom's not the one
[1:48:03] going to Israel right but the spirit off
[1:48:06] the Gentile church is the spirit of
[1:48:08] Elijah hallelujah amen brother ROM say
[1:48:10] this who who did he say Elijah was he
[1:48:12] said it's the spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:14] Christ Elijah of this day is the Lord
[1:48:16] Jesus Christ right see what are you
[1:48:18] saying brother Dale we'll get to it in a
[1:48:20] minute all right
[1:48:23] number 30 on your notes now in Matthew
[1:48:25] 16:28 which is page 62 of the patmas
[1:48:28] vision Church AG book now in Matthew
[1:48:32] 1628 prefacing or coming before Matthew
[1:48:35] 17 1-13 Jesus said there be some
[1:48:38] standing here which shall not taste
[1:48:40] death till they see the son of man
[1:48:42] coming in his kingdom
[1:48:45] right now watch it and the three
[1:48:48] Apostles did see just that the order of
[1:48:51] his second coming they saw him
[1:48:53] transfigured there on the Mountaintop
[1:48:56] his rment was Blazing white and his face
[1:48:58] Shone like the sun in its Zenith and
[1:49:00] there appeared stood Moses and Elijah on
[1:49:03] either side that is exactly how he's
[1:49:06] coming again listen truly Elijah will
[1:49:11] come first come and turn the hearts of
[1:49:13] the children bride back to their
[1:49:15] father's Apostolic word Doctrine so are
[1:49:19] you catching it
[1:49:24] here are you hmn 57125 31 on the notes
[1:49:28] and perhaps maybe I'm going to take it
[1:49:30] in a little different angle it really
[1:49:32] represents the coming of Christ a second
[1:49:34] time on the appearing of Moses and
[1:49:37] Elijah and then Christ only but it
[1:49:39] represents something
[1:49:42] more what does it
[1:49:44] represent the second coming of Jesus
[1:49:47] Christ in the spirit of Elijah that's
[1:49:49] the only time in the Bible that you'll
[1:49:51] find Moses and Elijah standing beside
[1:49:53] the Lord Jesus Christ someone show it to
[1:49:55] me the Book of Revelation they're
[1:49:57] standing before Zachariah know exactly
[1:50:00] he said it exactly listen here you himym
[1:50:03] 1957 310 32 in your notes now my brother
[1:50:08] theologians I know the real meaning the
[1:50:10] significance of this was the coming of
[1:50:12] the Lord the order of the coming Moses
[1:50:15] and Elijah to appear and then they look
[1:50:18] back and saw Jesus only but tonight it's
[1:50:20] approaching it for tonight let's
[1:50:23] approach it for a few minutes under
[1:50:25] another way cuz all the scriptures ties
[1:50:28] together there's no
[1:50:33] loopholes can you see what I'm talking
[1:50:36] about well let's read the next
[1:50:42] one here you himm 1957
[1:50:46] 807 but we want to take a new route on
[1:50:48] this tonight another way around because
[1:50:52] every word of God DB tals together
[1:50:54] there's no contradictions in the God's
[1:50:56] word it's like to see the scripture that
[1:50:59] con I'd like to see the scripture that
[1:51:01] contradicts itself that cannot be
[1:51:03] straightened by the same scripture if it
[1:51:06] is written surely in Parables because it
[1:51:08] is purposly did that way to confuse the
[1:51:10] wise and pruda that God might reveal it
[1:51:13] to babes such as would
[1:51:17] learn you see
[1:51:20] why that it thrilled my heart
[1:51:23] God I always
[1:51:24] knew that Matthew 17 had something to
[1:51:28] do with the second coming of Jesus
[1:51:32] Christ not just his first
[1:51:35] coming his second
[1:51:38] coming and what about his second
[1:51:42] coming I've tried my best to get it over
[1:51:44] to you that second coming started on the
[1:51:47] day of
[1:51:48] Pentecost is going to finish in this
[1:51:50] last days what with the spirit of Elijah
[1:51:53] that come forth to bring us the word and
[1:51:56] a little old
[1:51:58] Prophet when he died he didn't take it
[1:52:00] with him cuz your Prophet said the
[1:52:03] spirit of Elijah all of the Gentile
[1:52:07] bride would go to Israel I know that's
[1:52:10] hard for some people to swallow I didn't
[1:52:12] say it your Prophet did argue with
[1:52:15] him it's true but it perfectly fits
[1:52:19] because the spirit off of this Gentile
[1:52:20] bride is the spirit of Elijah
[1:52:23] which is the Lord Jesus Christ right see
[1:52:26] Moses and Elijah standing on Mount
[1:52:28] Transfiguration is the keyn note to tie
[1:52:30] the whole Bible together cuz it takes
[1:52:32] the new and the
[1:52:33] old right amen
[1:52:37] okay and brings it together so they can
[1:52:39] stand by the Lord because Elijah's got
[1:52:42] it had to come before Jesus could come
[1:52:45] before Moses could go to
[1:52:47] Israel and you know that the Jews
[1:52:49] actually believe that Elijah
[1:52:53] will precede the coming of the
[1:52:58] Messiah you don't believe that I'll give
[1:53:00] you some names to get a hold of it'll
[1:53:02] tell you about
[1:53:03] it the Jews believe that the that Elijah
[1:53:07] will precede the coming Messiah
[1:53:10] abely amen that's exactly right he just
[1:53:13] preceded it his message amen but you and
[1:53:17] I must be that message am
[1:53:20] amen not talk about it right be the
[1:53:24] message amen cuz it's not a talked about
[1:53:26] word that's going to
[1:53:28] Israel they'll take this message to
[1:53:31] Israel it will not be as one brother
[1:53:33] preached years ago that the two
[1:53:35] witnesses would be a gentile prophet and
[1:53:37] a gentile
[1:53:39] bride I told him then no brother Randon
[1:53:41] said he' be two Jews of course he didn't
[1:53:43] like what I said that's all right I just
[1:53:45] told him what brother Randon
[1:53:47] said brother man said there' be two Jews
[1:53:49] he said they won't receive it now you
[1:53:52] said well now wait a minute Elijah was a
[1:53:53] gentile well I can't explain that I just
[1:53:56] tell you what he said he said it'd be
[1:53:59] two Jews and go to Israel because they
[1:54:00] wouldn't accept nobody
[1:54:02] else see that's just the way I am I just
[1:54:05] read it and I see it that's why I do it
[1:54:06] I read the Bible I see it that way I
[1:54:08] read it for what it says I don't read it
[1:54:10] in Baptist
[1:54:11] GES or Methodist or two souls or seven
[1:54:14] Thunder virt PR River Jordans or
[1:54:16] whatever right I read it for
[1:54:21] myself but but that RAR has bothered me
[1:54:25] that I knew that Matthew 17 had to do
[1:54:29] with the second coming of Jesus
[1:54:31] Christ but I couldn't see how it would
[1:54:34] tie together until I saw those two
[1:54:37] prophets standing by the
[1:54:39] Lord and that's the only place in the
[1:54:41] Bible they stand by the Lord is on the
[1:54:43] Mount of
[1:54:45] transfiguration There Was Elijah to come
[1:54:47] to the Gentiles to bring the word and
[1:54:49] there was
[1:54:51] Moses that will go to Israel amen and
[1:54:54] this Spirit of Elijah will just come
[1:54:56] right off this Gentile bride and go
[1:54:58] right on with Moses amen finish up the
[1:55:01] Bible of what Moses saw in Exodus
[1:55:04] 25 when he saw seven golden
[1:55:09] candlesticks Zachariah saw it as the
[1:55:13] word of the
[1:55:15] Lord Matthew saw it is the actual coming
[1:55:19] and those two witnesses talking Moses
[1:55:22] and Elijah talking to
[1:55:28] Jesus John we don't want to be over
[1:55:30] there where he saw
[1:55:31] it it means we missed
[1:55:34] it come on Brothers take on these
[1:55:38] things sorry to be a little bit lengthy
[1:55:41] this morning I generally cut off a good
[1:55:42] bit before now but I'm sorry but I
[1:55:44] wanted to get it to
[1:55:46] you of the order of his second
[1:55:50] coming now I'm going to say it
[1:55:53] all
[1:55:54] right you got your
[1:55:57] pencil I'm going to say it okay don't
[1:56:01] come upside I didn't hear you say that
[1:56:03] well your brain was shut off or
[1:56:05] something happened cuz I'm going to say
[1:56:09] it there is no second coming of Jesus
[1:56:12] Christ outside of a mount
[1:56:14] Transfiguration experience of
[1:56:17] adoption that is the day that we're
[1:56:20] living in is the adoption time that's
[1:56:22] why the brother brandham knew that
[1:56:25] listen he said I'm going to take it from
[1:56:27] another approach you don't think he was
[1:56:30] just using the scriptures because it had
[1:56:32] hear ye himym in it he wanted to use it
[1:56:34] hear ye himm is the coming of the Lord
[1:56:36] Jesus
[1:56:40] Christ write that
[1:56:44] down adoption brings Jesus Christ on the
[1:56:50] scene as much as he let ever be here

[1:56:58] air so brother brandom said I'm just
[1:57:01] going to take it from
[1:57:03] this but he was showing the greatest
