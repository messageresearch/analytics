[0:00] then we don't
[0:01] want we don't want the knowledge of this
[0:04] world now I was thinking this
[0:09] morning brother randam
[0:13] never you know everybody well you need
[0:15] to take the kids we we come through that
[0:18] era where when you turned 16 years old
[0:20] they pulled you out of school and sent
[0:22] you to work because brother Brown said
[0:23] education was of the
[0:25] devil yet all of his children graduated
[0:29] school
[0:30] and even Billy Paul went to Bible
[0:32] College
[0:33] so it's like Dad said yesterday we were
[0:37] talking coming home from Hinton he said
[0:41] U if we don't get the essence of the
[0:44] message there's enough quotes in the
[0:48] message there are enough quotes that's
[0:51] going to kill you and it will quotes
[0:53] will kill
[0:55] you if you don't have the new birth
[0:58] there we go if you don't have a new
[1:00] birth to do what discern and that's what
[1:02] we're talking about with
[1:05] knowledge to me knowledge is summed up
[1:07] in one word
[1:09] discernment now you can have discernment
[1:11] and not be able to write your name Peter
[1:15] did right here Peter was couldn't even
[1:18] write his name yet he had
[1:21] discernment on the day of
[1:24] Pentecost God used an ignorant fisherman
[1:27] to bring the gospel right Peter was the
[1:30] first one Peter was the first spokesman
[1:32] he walks out and says
[1:34] hey this Jesus whom you've crucified he
[1:38] preached him a good sermon
[1:39] right but he didn't know how to write
[1:41] his name but you know
[1:44] what as in human
[1:47] knowledge brings you what
[1:50] experience or experience brings you
[1:53] knowledge both works both ways all right
[1:57] in in the human realm knowledge brings
[1:59] experience experience brings knowledge
[2:01] now I've seen some people that were 60
[2:03] years old that were still
[2:05] kids in their brain Susan said I got one
[2:09] said you shook your head I mean you're
[2:11] the one taking your head up I got a
[2:13] couple I got a couple Susan's got
[2:15] children running all over the place is
[2:20] grayhead but now
[2:22] look yeah he com yeah right get out of
[2:25] that one you hear that
[2:28] Dy but anyway but no really I have
[2:31] honestly and you have too you've seen
[2:32] people that were 60 years old that were
[2:34] so immature and just make you sick well
[2:36] that's human immaturity all right but
[2:39] now I've seen people that were in their
[2:41] 20s that you could learn something from
[2:44] if you just listen to them because they
[2:46] had some good things to say and that's
[2:49] just worldly
[2:51] knowledge but nothing ever beats
[2:54] experience nothing nothing beats being
[2:57] there nothing beats going through it
[2:59] nothing beats having a knowledge of
[3:02] you've been there you know you can
[3:04] sister Johnny can sit here and and as
[3:07] and as let me put this right as colorful
[3:11] as she
[3:12] is good word as colorful as she really
[3:15] and I mean she's very expl she explains
[3:18] things very well okay she could sit down
[3:21] and explain to me Time
[3:24] Square what what's another one oh um U
[3:27] what's the big old Gardens up there the
[3:30] Central Park Central Park she could
[3:31] you've been to Central Park all that see
[3:34] she know and she can just you know why
[3:36] you know why she's been there but see
[3:39] she can tell me and just be so vivid she
[3:42] can tell me the trees are beautiful and
[3:44] the the grass is green and and she can
[3:47] even tell me how to get there but you
[3:49] know what it's just that I have I have
[3:52] somebody else's word for
[3:54] it right now let's apply this to the
[3:56] spiritual
[3:58] part brother brand
[4:00] message is
[4:02] hearsay until it's revealed to
[4:05] you now want get that right hears say
[4:09] it's something a man said unless it's
[4:11] taken through the filter of your
[4:13] knowledge that's right and if you have
[4:17] human
[4:18] knowledge just human knowledge brother
[4:20] brand said you'll fight it all the time
[4:24] human knowledge puts people with the
[4:26] father son Holy Ghost baptism human
[4:28] knowledge brings a trinity cuz remember
[4:30] Godly knowledge never brings
[4:32] that Godly knowledge is over here pure
[4:35] and right and and nothing wrong with
[4:37] this with God's knowledge okay but we
[4:40] take our knowledge of what man's
[4:43] ideas cuz it was man's ideas that
[4:45] brought a father son Holy Ghost baptism
[4:47] it wasn't God it was man's idea that
[4:50] brought a trinity not God so we've got
[4:52] to take and you know what God will Wink
[4:54] in our ignorance when we can't really
[4:57] see one true and living God like we we
[4:59] should he'll Wink in our ignorance but
[5:02] he he would that all of us what come to
[5:05] um let's read these right here in in
[5:07] Timothy I like the way Paul puts it
[5:10] let's go to 1 Timothy
[5:18] 2 Timothy is a hard one for me to find
[5:21] yeah it's right after the one other one
[5:24] I can't find Thessalonians right after
[5:27] Thessalonians that I can't find
[5:30] but in the scoffield Bible it's
[5:32] 1275 but go to 1 Timothy 2 and
[5:39] 4 let's start with verse one I exhort
[5:44] therefore that first of all
[5:46] supplications prayers and intercessions
[5:49] and giving of thanks be made for all men
[5:52] for kings and for all that are in
[5:54] Authority that we may lead a quiet and
[5:56] peaceful life in all godliness and
[5:58] honesty now this is Paul right for this
[6:02] is good and
[6:04] acceptable in the sight of God our
[6:07] savior who will have all men who will
[6:10] have all men to be saved and to come to
[6:12] the
[6:13] knowledge of the truth now watch what
[6:16] he's
[6:17] saying for there is one God and one
[6:21] mediator between God and Men the man
[6:24] Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom
[6:26] for all to be testified and due time so
[6:30] he would that all come to the knowledge
[6:32] of Truth now he didn't he he finished
[6:34] that thought go to 2 Timothy
[6:36] 3:7 second Timothy he wrote the second
[6:39] letter and he still got the same
[6:44] thoughts but he's bringing these people
[6:48] in as being all those ugly things up
[6:51] above there you see that without natural
[6:53] affection truth Breakers false accusers
[6:55] incontinent Fierce despisers those that
[6:57] are good traitors he High minded L
[7:00] Pleasures more lovers of God having a
[7:02] form of godliness look at verse seven
[7:04] ever
[7:06] learning human
[7:09] knowledge trying to reason out God's
[7:12] word human knowledge ever learning and
[7:15] never able to come to the
[7:18] knowledge of the truth all right so
[7:21] that's where we go back to our
[7:24] definition of knowledge is discernment
[7:28] You' got to
[7:30] ear to
[7:32] me when the Bible says pray without
[7:36] ceasing to me I want to take that word
[7:38] and put discern in there you discern
[7:41] without ceasing cuz as you what do you
[7:42] pray
[7:43] about what do you pray about a choice
[7:47] what you pray about somebody's going
[7:49] through a problem somebody I'm going
[7:50] through a problem I'm going what
[7:53] discernment you know you know brother
[7:55] Dale can discern a lot of things that
[7:57] goes on by the way he sees you out
[7:59] that's right and he doesn't have to know
[8:01] the details but what does he do he goes
[8:03] to praying as an intercessor he's not a
[8:06] pope he's not a priest like that but
[8:08] he's he does intercede for
[8:11] you okay what did he do he has
[8:15] discernment not just discern right and
[8:18] wrong you should discern right and wrong
[8:21] down at Faith cuz remember there's only
[8:23] one sense in that inner realm Faith or
[8:27] doubt you have to discern which one is
[8:30] in your soul right now okay Faith or
[8:34] doubt you say well I I still doubt well
[8:38] just be
[8:39] careful just be careful when you use
[8:41] that word if you just say well well I
[8:43] just doubt everything but he's talking
[8:46] about the word of God right if you're
[8:48] doubting the word of God you don't have
[8:50] the new birth because the new birth is
[8:52] the birth of the word which is God right
[8:56] which is the perfect discernment all
[8:58] right so you got take that and look and
[9:00] see there's there's there's knowledge
[9:02] that you
[9:04] use in the
[9:07] Bible that's human knowledge and brother
[9:10] brandham talks about human
[9:12] knowledge and then there's knowledge of
[9:14] the Lord are the knowledge of the truth
[9:17] not knowledge of a truth we have a
[9:19] knowledge of a bunch of a truths that's
[9:21] right but we won't we need to have if
[9:24] you're born again that starts in baby
[9:26] form a knowledge of the truth and I want
[9:29] I would love them to put the in capital
[9:32] letter a knowledge of the
[9:35] truth brother said you have a knowledge
[9:37] on the Revelation but if you have a
[9:39] knowledge that is the
[9:41] Revelation it's the same it's one you're
[9:44] not wondering all right that's what
[9:47] knowledge does to me the third one up
[9:50] Faith Faith or doubt you're either born
[9:53] in or you're not you're not halfway
[9:54] there like brother Brown said you're not
[9:56] a half pregnant woman you're either
[9:58] expecting or you're or not all right so
[10:01] you're either impregnated with the word
[10:03] or you're not one of the two you got to
[10:05] figure that out but it is in a baby
[10:08] form everybody understand that this is a
[10:11] baby form this Holy Spirit right here is
[10:13] not a baby form that's right that's
[10:16] almost a full grown man right all right
[10:19] or woman okay but right here that's baby
[10:22] form Faith that's where Paul's talking
[10:25] about drinking the sincere milk of the
[10:28] word mhm cuz you got to have start you
[10:30] got to start with milk all right that's
[10:33] what I said then you got to go to Virtue
[10:36] add to what you believe
[10:38] virtue
[10:40] strength not only that people can draw
[10:43] strength from you but that you have
[10:44] inter strength for yourself okay and
[10:48] then you got to have knowledge what
[10:49] discernment that discernment is really
[10:52] uh you take Temperance and patience and
[10:54] godliness you better have some knowledge
[10:56] coming up there some discernment mhm
[10:59] or you'll trip up cuz brother Brandon
[11:01] really doesn't talk a whole lot about
[11:03] knowledge but he goes to Temperance and
[11:05] patience and you watch him in this in
[11:08] the Statue of a perfect man book he'll
[11:10] say right here's where we fall
[11:13] off he didn't say virtue he didn't say
[11:15] knowledge he got up to Temperance and
[11:17] patience and he said right here's where
[11:18] we fall off or here's where we fall
[11:20] short so he knew that Temperance and
[11:22] patience was going to have he's going to
[11:24] have to have a real wide strong
[11:26] Foundation that's right of Faith virtue
[11:29] because you know what if you have Godly
[11:30] knowledge it'll help your Temperance and
[11:32] your
[11:33] patience cuz what are you doing you're
[11:35] Discerning
[11:36] right you Discerning whether you used to
[11:39] smack the guy in the mouth or you know
[11:41] run your mouth to the to the to the
[11:43] woman or the neighbor or whatever that's
[11:44] right but if you got a knowledge of the
[11:46] truth in you that says
[11:48] hey without God I'd be just like that
[11:51] person that's right that's true without
[11:54] God I'd be just like that person that's
[11:56] right that's what daddy's been telling
[11:57] us when we come into that human but that
[11:59] human body is an animal body it reacts
[12:03] to to animal
[12:07] nature what brother Brown said right
[12:10] this is
[12:12] animal and without the holy ghost man is
[12:14] what same as a brute Beast same thing
[12:17] now he's got a soul that he's got to be
[12:19] judged by don't get me wrong but he is a
[12:22] brute Beast you see it now did you see
[12:26] the other day where that
[12:27] principle in a school was raping a boy
[12:32] while his parents were sitting out in
[12:34] the
[12:35] lobby oh yeah I mean how stupid and how
[12:39] how overwhelming this power is that
[12:43] Satan has on people now Hey listen
[12:45] brother Brown said in the
[12:47] 50s that we were one click away from
[12:50] Insanity one click which means one one
[12:52] little clip one little turn I think
[12:55] we've went all through that
[12:57] turn but remember we got to be just like
[12:59] Sodom and
[13:01] Gomorrah those sodomites tried their
[13:04] best to get drag those angels
[13:06] out they did men right that's right and
[13:10] do something with them and lot got so
[13:12] caught up and read the Bible it's pretty
[13:14] tough lot said here take my
[13:17] daughters here take my
[13:20] daughters and lot was a righteous man B
[13:24] what the Bible said but see it vexed his
[13:26] righteous Soul he was what was he was
[13:28] trying to do right
[13:29] but he was in the wrong environment
[13:31] remember Abraham stayed in the right
[13:33] environment same way with you and I
[13:36] that's right we got to live in this
[13:37] sodomite World Lord we got to live in it
[13:40] but we don't have to be partakers of it
[13:42] all right it says ever learning never
[13:45] able to come to the knowledge of the
[13:47] truth why they never got born
[13:49] again that's the whole thing if they
[13:52] would have got born again they would
[13:53] have become into the knowledge of the
[13:55] truth and at least had a little
[13:58] understanding of what was going going on
[14:01] okay I think in the preaching today in
[14:03] Sunday School in these days and Sunday
[14:06] school I find that I'm Discerning my
[14:10] actions and reactions continuously yeah
[14:14] that's what I mean the Bible says pray
[14:15] without ceasing well you can't close
[14:16] your eyes and pray but prayer to me is
[14:19] discernment like I said if you're
[14:20] praying about a situation or you're
[14:22] praying about a person what are you
[14:23] doing you're Discerning whether they
[14:25] need prayer or
[14:27] not whether God needs to change that
[14:29] situation or not
[14:32] right brother Brandon remember he had a
[14:35] problem with
[14:37] that
[14:39] remember he said I have to be able to
[14:43] discern this is not exact quote but he
[14:45] in other words he was telling the
[14:47] people I have to be careful because God
[14:50] put something on a person right to
[14:52] straighten them up remember and he said
[14:55] I've prayed it off and got in trouble
[14:57] with God why because God honors the
[14:59] prayer
[15:00] first he honors the prayer of a
[15:02] righteous man aileth much ises that what
[15:04] the scripture says prayer of a righteous
[15:06] man our woman ath much right so he
[15:09] prayed that all he says I have to be
[15:13] careful discern be careful what I'm
[15:17] doing with what God gave cuz see God
[15:19] gave him that gift it was his to
[15:22] operate it was his cuz remember brother
[15:26] Brown said this is my eye God gave it to
[15:27] me now he didn't say those little things
[15:29] just for just for filling up tape space
[15:32] but remember God gives you the Holy
[15:34] Ghost it's now yours it's not his
[15:36] anymore it's yours it's a possession
[15:37] it's yours you have it it's your Holy
[15:40] Ghost all right it's him in another form
[15:42] but still it's yours because if it's not
[15:45] yours it's somebody else's or it's not
[15:47] even yours to start with
[15:50] that listen gra B like sister who died
[15:55] sister B and it is a confusion
[15:59] a friend
[16:01] or said probably that is correct because
[16:06] what he done was he heard something
[16:08] different and started praying for a
[16:10] sister over here see if and but it was
[16:12] Sister Bell's time to go home right but
[16:15] God knew if he heard that sister Bell's
[16:18] name and started praying for her he
[16:19] would have to answer that prophet's
[16:21] prayer right right so see what did God
[16:25] do God didn't change brother Brown's
[16:28] mind
[16:29] brother B heard just a different
[16:32] name you know brother bam even said he
[16:34] said God didn't tell me when my mother
[16:35] was dying or going to die he didn't tell
[16:38] me that my father was dying see there's
[16:39] things that God don't tell you cuz you
[16:41] know what as human beings it would drive
[16:43] us crazy it drove him crazy
[16:46] enough shaking people's hands and seeing
[16:48] Devils all over the place and knowing
[16:50] that they liked him and didn't like him
[16:51] and all that stuff but you know what he
[16:54] had a
[16:55] knowledge of the truth and now that's
[16:58] what he brought to me and you he had the
[17:01] but that knowledge of the truth and
[17:02] we'll get into it sometime maybe next
[17:04] year that Capstone of love I want you to
[17:07] know one thing for sure and I want you
[17:08] to think about
[17:10] this this right here is a little pyramid
[17:15] right that's a little pyramid of this so
[17:18] all this in its super form is right
[17:21] there right anybody got that remember
[17:25] how brother NE taught and how I teach it
[17:27] justification satification baptism of
[17:28] the Holy Ghost justification
[17:30] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[17:31] you got to go through all that and then
[17:33] you don't stop you go through the
[17:35] highest form cuz this person didn't do
[17:38] it this one
[17:40] did this person down here did it you did
[17:44] you know you did it cuz you was there
[17:46] but that Capstone of love that person
[17:47] never done it that's the Justified
[17:50] Justified I never done it in the first
[17:51] first place all right that's what this
[17:53] is driving out it's driving out the old
[17:56] person all right
[17:59] but all these gifts don't just stay down
[18:01] here all these gifts in their Apex form
[18:05] is in this right here everybody
[18:07] understand what I'm saying everybody got
[18:09] it it's just a higher form of this you
[18:12] never lose any of
[18:14] these in your human
[18:16] form got it cuz this is the statue of a
[18:19] perfect man all
[18:21] right cuz all this guess what's going to
[18:24] happen with all this it's going to be in
[18:27] its total Apex form when we get out of
[18:30] here you're still going to have
[18:33] faith you're not going to lose
[18:36] Faith no what did Brother Brown said
[18:39] what' God do he just believed he could
[18:41] do it he said let there
[18:42] be let that what you and I are supposed
[18:45] to do create a world go live on it cuz
[18:48] we got the Creator in US virtue
[18:50] knowledge Temperance patience all that
[18:52] St sure it's going to be under
[18:55] control but we got to get it under
[18:57] control down here
[18:59] because it's just going to be highest
[19:01] form up there everybody understand that
[19:03] you know you don't lose
[19:06] things when you go to heaven you
[19:10] gain you gain things what Dad and I were
[19:13] talking about yesterday people people
[19:15] are on to this well I was born with this
[19:17] eternal life and I don't have to do this
[19:19] that the other well
[19:20] now of course we don't agree with that
[19:23] at all the Bible doesn't agree with that
[19:26] and the prophet's message doesn't agree
[19:27] with it if you read it right right
[19:33] but if I have the new
[19:36] birth I can look back to all those
[19:39] things before the foundation of the
[19:40] world how I was in the mind of God how
[19:42] that my attribute was before the world
[19:45] was and how that I was preaching last
[19:47] Sunday on the DNA of the Holy
[19:50] Ghost well the Holy Ghost was the
[19:53] creator Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost
[19:55] brother BR said was the same person so
[19:58] who created the world Christ right but
[20:01] now Paul said it's who in
[20:03] you the Creator in you that's right the
[20:06] hope of glory so that's why brother
[20:08] Brown said you could create a world and
[20:09] go live on it because what's inside you
[20:11] in other words knows how to do it but
[20:13] there's a bar there which is a human bar
[20:15] we're down here we don't need to go make
[20:17] another world and live on it but we're a
[20:19] Creator we're still a little Creator
[20:22] Even in our lower form remember how
[20:25] brother B said you can create a
[20:26] situation you can change a situation
[20:28] he went in and his wife with all you
[20:31] know and and the prophet put on an
[20:34] apron and went to
[20:36] work I've told you I've told you the
[20:40] best way to get what you want from a
[20:41] woman is to put on an apron grab a broom
[20:44] and a mop Kendrick pay
[20:49] attention you ain't got hey you ain't
[20:51] got to adverti it don't be walking
[20:53] around no yard with no no no apron on
[20:56] all right inside the
[20:59] house but what did he do brother Brown
[21:02] Put on an apron started helping her with
[21:04] the dishes started putting the kids he
[21:06] giving them the toys and he said what 15
[21:09] minutes later he said it was just a hole
[21:11] what was it it was the one inside of
[21:14] him what would have we
[21:17] done woman hurry up and get my yeah kids
[21:21] hurry up and can't you shut them kids up
[21:25] you know I
[21:26] mean but what did he do he never raised
[21:29] his voice he just went in and you know
[21:31] started helping him and that's the same
[21:33] way with knowledge knowledge to me is
[21:35] discernment and that is 24/7 that's
[21:41] right that's that's to me that's praying
[21:43] without ceasing when you see that word
[21:45] pray without ceasing put the word
[21:47] discern in there cuz you're Discerning
[21:50] without ceasing you're ever deser every
[21:52] day that's right somebody cuts you off
[21:54] on the
[21:57] freeway you used to Des you used to not
[22:00] discern at all that's right you just
[22:03] reacted gave them the one finger wave
[22:06] you know or give them one of these or
[22:09] got ill about it you know but now what
[22:12] do you
[22:13] do I hope you still don't do
[22:17] that
[22:19] John how
[22:22] colorful you know you try to do I I I do
[22:26] try and the light you know how some
[22:28] people when they see the light turn
[22:29] yellow and if you're so far from The
[22:31] Edge I mean from the light you know you
[22:33] going have to stop this person behind me
[22:35] sto going I know what you wanted I got
[22:38] so angry I said I wish the I had a
[22:41] microphone where I could see I fly over
[22:45] me I got so angry well that's okay I
[22:48] mean you didn't bent to them you didn't
[22:50] get out of the car and do what you
[22:54] know you see them guys on a motorcycle
[22:56] the other day on it on the internet too
[22:59] New York in New York they were just this
[23:02] man was just really minding his own
[23:03] business with his family had a kid in
[23:05] the car and they the motorcyclist
[23:08] thought they had the road so they pulled
[23:10] out and stopped in front of him and he
[23:12] bumped one and Buddy after that it just
[23:14] escalated yeah he run over one of them
[23:16] and but he they pulled him out and beat
[23:18] him right there in front of the wife and
[23:19] the kids
[23:22] now what do you do in that situation
[23:24] number one don't go to New
[23:26] York
[23:29] and all you New Yorkers I'm sorry I just
[23:33] I
[23:37] know no after about six maybe but if I
[23:40] can get that other clip in I might get
[23:42] the
[23:44] rest from church on uh Sunday these two
[23:49] guys wasac together and they got so
[23:51] angry each other they got the car shot
[23:54] each other both yeah I read about that
[23:56] they didn't have a g they
[23:58] now look there's a there's see this is
[24:00] where discernment comes in like if if
[24:02] you would have been driving that car and
[24:04] your wife and kids and you weren't
[24:06] provoking or hurting anybody now if a
[24:08] guy comes up and takes his helmet and
[24:10] drives it through my windshield I'm
[24:12] going to shoot that man and I ain't
[24:14] going to shoot him in the
[24:15] belly cuz I have done nothing you but
[24:18] see you got to discern that okay it's
[24:20] like Daddy said he said somebody breaks
[24:21] in your house and starts getting on and
[24:23] you got kids and your wife in the house
[24:25] shoot
[24:26] them I mean he's a brute Beast he's
[24:29] either on something or you know but you
[24:31] know what we do we pray that God doesn't
[24:34] ever put us in that but if he ever
[24:36] does but if he ever does it's something
[24:38] for you that's right you're going to
[24:41] give that person something but it's
[24:44] something for you to help you to
[24:47] discern cuz you know what he said he'd
[24:50] never put no more on you then you can
[24:52] stand you got boy sometimes you get when
[24:56] to back off that's correct
[24:58] well see without Holy Ghost knowledge or
[25:01] or even Temperance and patience what are
[25:03] you going to do you're going to go on
[25:04] over the
[25:06] edge and possibly kill somebody that's
[25:08] correct and what the knowledge of God is
[25:10] doing now is is even in a
[25:13] situation we know when to stop
[25:17] yeah cuz I mean those two didn't know
[25:19] and I remember Sister Johnny brought up
[25:21] a good point they were just road rage so
[25:24] they got some M they bumped each other
[25:26] and pulled off on side of the road and
[25:27] they both pulled about guns and they
[25:28] killed each
[25:29] other best thing to do if somebody does
[25:32] that to you just go on because you never
[25:33] know what kind of idiots driving that
[25:35] car you know what kind of person driving
[25:36] your car but you don't know what kind of
[25:38] person driving your car of their car
[25:41] just don't put yourself in that
[25:42] situation but with Holy Ghost knowledge
[25:44] you'll say God if it wasn't for you I'd
[25:48] beat that kid to death or I'd beat that
[25:50] person up and you know what to me when
[25:52] you walk away from that that gives you
[25:54] more satisfaction than if you had have
[25:56] done it for sure I think so cuz I told
[25:59] the church over and just before we go
[26:02] listen listen to this what about these
[26:06] people that are preaching that you
[26:07] always was eternal you didn't need
[26:08] nothing that you you you're
[26:10] predestinated and you're predetermined
[26:12] and that's what you're going to be and
[26:13] you have no choice now how would you
[26:15] like to live that to me that would be a
[26:16] zombie that would be something that
[26:18] you're just walking through life and or
[26:20] what about knowing you were
[26:23] lost knowing you were going to hell
[26:26] knowing that you were doing things wrong
[26:29] and then God comes down and says
[26:32] hey be my
[26:35] child what a
[26:37] redeemer What A Savior I want to be
[26:40] saved from this guy amen this is the
[26:42] person I want to get saved from right
[26:45] here and if I can get saved from this
[26:46] person everything's all right all right
[26:49] let's go all right we'll talk a little
[26:52] bit more about knowledge and then we'll
[26:53] get into Temperance next
[26:56] Sunday
[27:03] I just want to know with temp is
[27:06] okay okay
[27:08] to
[27:10] what if it's not sister you pray for me
[27:21] yeah
