[0:00] the earth where we've been taken from.
[0:01] Father, we want to ask that you will be
[0:03] with us, Father, as we prepare for
[0:06] service, Lord. Thank you for the message
[0:08] that's gone forward. Thank you for the
[0:09] Sunday school teaching, Father, that
[0:11] will go before. Uh I pray that you will
[0:13] prepare us for worshiping, for praying,
[0:16] for service, Father, and for the
[0:17] preaching of your precious word. That
[0:19] you inspire the minister, Father. That
[0:21] you would just put, Father, that
[0:23] anointing, Father, to all the the words
[0:25] and give it life to us. And I pray uh
[0:27] that you would prepare the way for a
[0:30] good time today of fellowship in your
[0:32] word in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[0:35] Amen.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Today I'm going be
[0:38] speaking on rest.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; So
[0:43] many rest to our souls, right?
[0:45] And it's a it's a very settling thing to
[0:48] have this age,
[0:50] to have it from the inside out, and to
[0:52] have a rest about where we came from,
[0:54] the destination, where we're going. You
[0:57] know, we we do live in a world that is
[0:58] is raging all the more, sometimes our
[1:00] own body, sometimes our own
[1:02] circumstances,
[1:04] and just everything. And it seems like
[1:05] the more um time goes on, the more that
[1:09] we see the struggle, the um
[1:13] the more I've been able to mature, the
[1:15] more I'm realizing that there's just
[1:16] really a lot to contend with, right? But
[1:19] one thing's for sure, right, is when
[1:20] that soul is at rest, we have that that
[1:23] precious anchor. So have you resting in
[1:25] God in a restless world
[1:28] in God's word, right? So for in Exodus
[1:30] uh 33 we know God uh spoke to Moses and
[1:33] that's when he promised that his
[1:34] presence will be there with him and he
[1:36] said my presence shall go with thee and
[1:40] I will give thee rest. So it's a rest
[1:42] that is given. It's a rest that it's you
[1:45] enter into. It's a rest that we um you
[1:48] know in Spanish they use the word
[1:49] repose. So it's a look looking at the
[1:52] differences between those two words.
[1:53] Repose is is just it's a deeper meaning
[1:56] to it. Whereas rest it could it could
[1:58] also be literal right like sleeping like
[2:01] uh like you know sitting down being
[2:03] still but this rest is is a in Spanish
[2:07] for the most of the times it doesn't use
[2:08] like the word rest it actually uses the
[2:10] word repose which is such a rich word to
[2:14] mean like it kind of adds more than just
[2:17] being you know still it puts all those
[2:19] together. So I'm thankful that there
[2:22] remains to rest right. So we know in
[2:24] Hebrews 4:9 kind of goes back and forth
[2:26] because there's even a promise that that
[2:29] God swore that they would not enter into
[2:30] the rest. But we'll read to whom it's
[2:33] talking about and under what condition.
[2:36] But you know sometimes we take those
[2:37] words and and we bring bring content to
[2:39] it that of course there remainth the
[2:41] rest are for though right to the people
[2:44] of God right and uh it's a blessing to
[2:47] know here I was reading on Ruth how
[2:50] God rested we know when he created and
[2:54] he loves resting he's commanded rest in
[2:56] the the one day and seven he's commanded
[2:58] rest one year and seven he's commanded
[3:00] rest after the seven times seven I mean
[3:03] seven uh times that you have the seven
[3:05] year and then you have the jubilee,
[3:08] right? But one of the things is for
[3:10] certain is is God will not rest until he
[3:13] does certain things. And I know he's
[3:15] typified here. So then in Ruth we have
[3:18] then said she sit still as Naomi my
[3:22] daughter until thou know it says until
[3:26] thou daughter it says until thou know
[3:29] how the matter will fall for the man
[3:32] will not be in rest until he have
[3:35] finished the thing this day. What a
[3:38] confidence, right? To know that that um
[3:41] the only way the Lord's going to rest is
[3:43] when he accomplished what what he wants
[3:45] to do. And then he does rest and then he
[3:46] gives his rest. Here it is in Isaiah 62
[3:49] coming forth. It says uh first verse,
[3:52] for Zion's sake, I will not hold my
[3:55] peace.
[3:57] And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest
[4:00] until the righteous thereof go forth as
[4:04] brightness and the salvation thereof as
[4:08] a lamp that burnth.
[4:11] So God God loves rest. He constituted
[4:14] rest. He's the one that um was the one
[4:17] that created it all and he was his own
[4:18] inspector, right? He saw that and he
[4:20] said that it was good and and and that's
[4:22] why he rested because things were as
[4:24] they ought to be, right? And I think
[4:27] that um he grants that to the believer,
[4:29] right? As we'll learn here a little bit,
[4:31] we'll go through the we'll learn a
[4:33] little bit about unrest, right? And one
[4:35] of the things that it takes to be able
[4:37] to when you do enter into his rest, just
[4:40] what a contrast it is and what a
[4:42] difference it is and what a stillness it
[4:44] is, particularly when we're speaking
[4:45] about the soul. So here we have um in
[4:49] first kings 8:56 it says blessed be the
[4:52] Lord that hath given us given rest unto
[4:55] his people Israel according to all that
[4:58] he promised. He had not failed one word
[5:01] of all his good promise which he
[5:04] promised by the hand of Moses. Amen. His
[5:08] servant. We're so thankful we have that
[5:09] type in this age, right? where we have a
[5:11] message uh that's a promise and that and
[5:14] that a lot of people see it as a
[5:16] something to u of confusion but but it
[5:19] is a rest it is a rest brothers and I'll
[5:22] just touch here about nine verses nine
[5:25] nine scripture verses I have here about
[5:27] what it is to be at unrest right because
[5:30] it it in order for you to be at rest to
[5:32] even know what it was is you had to go
[5:34] through the unrest in our life right so
[5:37] what I have here is in Jeremiah 6:16
[5:40] thus Say the Lord, stand ye in the ways,
[5:42] and see and ask for the old paths.
[5:47] Where is the good way and walk therein?
[5:51] And you shall find rest for your souls.
[5:55] But they said, we will not walk therein.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Man, we've all had our times. Look what
[6:02] Job said here. My bones are pierced in
[6:06] me in the night season and my sinu take
[6:11] no rest. Look at Job 30:27. I've been
[6:16] here. He says, "My bowels boiled
[6:21] and rested not.
[6:24] The days of affliction prevented me." We
[6:28] know what unrest is, right? in sleeping
[6:30] or in rest in in just your emotions or
[6:33] in rest in um in your eternal
[6:36] destination.
[6:37] How is that soul going to be resting
[6:39] when there's when there's no assurance?
[6:42] Right? Whether people know it or not.
[6:44] Psalms 38:3 it says, "There is no
[6:47] soundness in my flesh because of thine
[6:49] anger. Neither is there any rest any in
[6:54] my bones because of my sin."
[6:57] You know, interesting enough, I was
[6:58] meditating on this and I had to gas up
[7:01] yesterday and I went and I went to the
[7:03] gas station and then there was this song
[7:05] bad to my bones or something like that
[7:07] and I was just bad and I'm like trying
[7:08] to get away from I'm like I'm just the
[7:10] the machine was broken so I had to get
[7:12] down there and pay and it just said bad
[7:14] to the bones and I just read the
[7:16] scripture and I'm like Lord let me be
[7:17] good to the bones you [laughter] know
[7:20] it's just like there's no soundness in
[7:22] my flesh because of thine anger neither
[7:24] is there any rest in my bones. I mean,
[7:27] look at that. Even your bones need rest
[7:29] or the anointing rests, right? We know
[7:32] because of my sins. So, unbelief.
[7:36] But the wicked are like the troubled
[7:38] sea. I just put a little image of that.
[7:41] When it cannot rest, whose waters cast
[7:45] up mire and dirt. So, no good, right?
[7:48] And I threw in this proverb over here
[7:49] because I thought it was pretty fitting.
[7:52] If a wise man contended, so even if you
[7:54] try to contend right, with the foolish
[7:57] man, whether he rage or laugh, there's
[8:01] just no rest.
[8:03] Isn't that something? Makes you wonder
[8:05] why sometimes when you're speaking to
[8:06] certain persons, you you just cannot get
[8:08] to that rest.
[8:10] Help us, Lord. Right? It's a condition.
[8:13] And Hebrews it says, "And to whom swear
[8:15] he that they should not enter into his
[8:18] rest, comma,
[8:20] but to them that believeth not." You
[8:23] see, sometimes we just say, "Oh, he said
[8:24] he won't enter into his rest." Of
[8:26] course, there is no rest in unbelief.
[8:30] There's no rest in in um in us not
[8:33] coming but God's provided way right of
[8:35] atonement and of a
[8:38] provided way for for all for being
[8:41] justified
[8:43] for being then there's another rest that
[8:45] comes when we're sanctified and then
[8:47] there's another rest that comes when
[8:48] you're baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[8:51] fire in the soul right and then I
[8:53] believe we're promised and we already
[8:54] are believing onto receiving the
[8:56] glorification right of our body because
[8:58] we already received the first fruits
[9:00] in our in our soul. Amen.
[9:03] And and here we have in Hebrews 4:101,
[9:07] there's a lot just a few verses next.
[9:10] For he that is entered, see you have to
[9:12] enter in into his rest, he also hath
[9:16] seized from his own works, the person as
[9:20] God did from his. 11. Let us labor
[9:24] therefore to enter into that rest, lest
[9:27] any man fall after the same example of
[9:30] unbelief. There's clearly a a
[9:33] correlation where unbelief, unrest.
[9:35] Belief rest. And the soul has two
[9:37] senses.
[9:39] Faith or sin, doubt, unbelief.
[9:43] There's either rest or no rest in the
[9:44] soul. But to have rest from sin,
[9:48] brothers, that's what the scriptures are
[9:49] talking about. That's that's to have
[9:51] rest from unbelief. You know what it's
[9:53] like to to have a rest that you just
[9:56] don't have to sin. You don't have to
[9:58] unbelief. You don't have to disbelieve
[10:01] this message, his Bible, his word to us.
[10:04] That's a rest.
[10:07] Isaiah 14:3.
[10:09] And it shall come to pass in the day
[10:12] that the Lord shall give thee rest from
[10:15] thy sorrow and from thy fear
[10:19] and from the hard bondage wherewin
[10:23] wherein thou was made to serve. That's
[10:27] the condition that we're having rest
[10:29] from. In Isaiah
[10:31] Psalms 94, it says that thou mayest give
[10:35] him rest from the days of adversity
[10:38] until the pit be digged for the wicked.
[10:42] And then so this is how we long I
[10:44] believe that when you're going through
[10:46] the process of going from unrest to to
[10:48] rest. I remember these these scriptures
[10:51] these verses when you're saying when it
[10:52] says in Psalm 55:6 and I said oh that I
[10:56] had wings like a dove for then I will I
[11:01] would would I fly and be at rest
[11:05] &gt;&gt; just escaping it all right sometimes in
[11:07] this world of unbelief
[11:10] and God given us that message this time
[11:12] God's given us that assurance that the
[11:15] scriptures are laying in the Bible
[11:16] applied died that are made alive in the
[11:19] believer. It it produces that rest that
[11:22] rest of knowing that that we have
[11:25] rapturing faith that we we are going
[11:28] through what the Bible promised.
[11:30] Jeremiah 30:10. Therefore, fear thou
[11:33] not, oh my servant Jacob, saith the
[11:35] Lord, neither be dismayed, oh Israel,
[11:38] for lo I, personal pronouns, will save
[11:41] thee from afar, and thy seed, a promise
[11:44] for the future, too, from the land of
[11:47] their captivity. And Jacob shall return,
[11:50] and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and
[11:55] none shall make him afraid.
[11:58] Amen. I look at this photo here. There's
[12:01] this lighthouse and there's this water.
[12:04] It's a famous photograph and there's
[12:07] this big waves and there's you can
[12:08] barely see that there's a person right
[12:09] there is standing. That's kind of what
[12:12] it looks like when you're transitioning
[12:13] from unrest or starting to to be in the
[12:15] lighthouse, right? Starting to be
[12:17] settled on the rock.
[12:20] 2 Thessalonians
[12:22] chapter 1:7 says, "And thou and to you
[12:26] who are troubled, rest with us when the
[12:31] Lord Jesus shall be revealed
[12:34] from heaven with his mighty angels
[12:39] preparation." Amen.
[12:42] So we have this is this is my favorite
[12:43] one. This one just came alive when I
[12:46] read it for the first time that I can
[12:47] remember reading it. And Psalm 116:7
[12:51] says, this is a prayer or a song. Return
[12:56] unto thy rest, oh my soul. It's like
[12:59] you're singing to your own soul, right?
[13:01] For the [clears throat] Lord hath dealt
[13:02] bountifully with thee. Now, we know we
[13:05] go through hardship, but it's talking
[13:07] about the soul. It's talking about that
[13:09] rest. The Lord has given us that rest in
[13:12] the soul when when there's that faith.
[13:15] Amen. Psalm 37:7 says, "Rest in the Lord
[13:21] and wait patiently for him. Fred not
[13:23] thyself because of him who prosperth in
[13:26] his way because of the man who bringeth
[13:30] wicked devices to pass. Rest in the
[13:32] Lord." Is 32:17.
[13:36] And the work of righteousness shall be
[13:40] peace. But look at the effect. And the
[13:43] effect of righteousness, quietness and
[13:46] assurance forever.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; And my people shall dwell in a peaceable
[13:54] habitation
[13:56] and in sure dwellings and in quiet
[14:00] resting places.
[14:02] That's a good description here of of the
[14:05] believer's rest.
[14:07] I said 321 171 18 just full of rich
[14:11] words like that's going to be the effect
[14:12] of righteousness. You're going to have
[14:14] quietness, assurance forever and you're
[14:17] going to have uh his people he said have
[14:19] a peaceable habitation and in sure
[14:21] dwellings and in quiet resting places
[14:25] man from all the noise of the world and
[14:26] all the unbelief.
[14:29] I I just remember what it's like to
[14:31] enter into that rest. And it is a
[14:35] settleness of the things that are of of
[14:37] divine value, right? Of of eternal
[14:40] value. And I'll go fast here because we
[14:42] got some really good uh more message
[14:43] quotes and scriptures to share. Psalm
[14:45] 139 1-3, it says, "Oh Lord, thou has
[14:49] searched me and known me. Thou knowest,
[14:51] so he knows your rest. Thou knowest my
[14:53] sitting down and my uprising. Thou
[14:55] understandeth my thoughts far far off.
[14:58] Thou compasseth
[15:00] that's just a way another way of saying
[15:01] he understand my path and my lying. And
[15:04] that word lying there I know I read it
[15:06] in other verses in in Spanish in
[15:08] particular version of King James. And
[15:10] that lying down it it just means repose.
[15:12] It's rest. So it's beautiful to says
[15:14] that he knows your rest. He's
[15:16] acquainted. He knows when you go out and
[15:18] sit and rest with them and and and
[15:20] stay still with him and are acquainted
[15:22] with all of my ways. Just think it's
[15:25] beautiful that he he cares for for the
[15:27] rest. So let's talk a little bit about
[15:29] the Lord's rest. He himself rests as
[15:31] well and and he talks about his own rest
[15:33] and how he rests. So we know in Genesis
[15:36] and God blessed the seventh day and
[15:38] sanctified it because that in in it he
[15:42] had rested. He's the first one that you
[15:44] know instituted rest from all his works
[15:47] which God created and made in Isaiah 11
[15:50] and10. And in that day there shall be a
[15:53] root of Jesse which shall stand for an
[15:56] end sign of the people to it shall the
[15:59] Gentiles seek. Isn't that beautiful that
[16:01] we're prophesied even in the Old
[16:03] Testament that the Gentiles It's
[16:04] interesting sometimes the the Jews,
[16:06] right? Uh there there's even uh we're
[16:09] promised in their own Bible to to be
[16:12] manifested. It says to it shall the
[16:15] Gentiles seek and his rest shall be
[16:18] glorious. Says a glorious rest even for
[16:20] the Gentiles is promised here. We know
[16:22] for the for the church for Zion. And it
[16:26] says Matthew 8:20. And Jesus said unto
[16:28] him, "The foxes have holes and the birds
[16:32] of the air have nests, but the son of
[16:35] man hath not where to lay his head." So
[16:39] interesting, right? There was a rest in
[16:41] the natural and the ark, in the
[16:42] covenant, and a place for him to dwell
[16:44] in, for his presence to dwell in. And of
[16:46] course, we know that in the spiritual,
[16:48] right, he wants to dwell in a certain
[16:49] place. So we we talk about his rest in
[16:52] in there. And it says in Acts 7:49,
[16:56] "Heaven is my throne and earth is my
[16:59] foottool. So what house will you build
[17:01] me? Say the Lord." Or what is the place
[17:05] of my rest?
[17:07] Right?
[17:09] Challenging there. Uh and look at this.
[17:11] Psalm 132 for I think he answers it. For
[17:15] the Lord has chosen Zion.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; He had desired it for his habitation.
[17:22] This is my rest forever.
[17:26] Very Bible good Bible answer here
[17:30] in Zion. Forever he wants to rest there.
[17:33] I will dwell.
[17:35] And usually where you dwell is where you
[17:37] rest for I have desired it.
[17:41] I will abundantly bless her provision. I
[17:44] will satisfy her poor with bread with
[17:48] God's own word. Right? And I just want
[17:50] to highlight that verse again. It's in
[17:51] the middle of the two I I read. This is
[17:54] my rest forever. Here I will dwell
[17:57] for I have desired it. Talking about
[17:59] sign. So that is his resting place.
[18:02] Psalm 1328 it says arise O Lord into thy
[18:05] rest. Look at that. This is beautiful.
[18:07] It's like the psalmist or it's a song or
[18:10] a poem or something being out. It says
[18:12] arise O Lord into thy rest. So it's
[18:15] actually commanding the Lord to rest. It
[18:18] says, "Thou the ark of thy strength."
[18:22] Isn't that beautiful? This is actually
[18:24] somebody else speaking these words on
[18:26] behalf of the Lord. It says, "Go ahead
[18:28] and arrest, Lord, you and in the ark of
[18:31] thy strength."
[18:34] And then we have here where um where it
[18:37] says, I want to just quickly read this
[18:38] because I thought of I found something
[18:40] really interesting um about Solomon. So,
[18:44] we know David and then Solomon ended up
[18:46] building the his temple. Behold, a son
[18:49] shall be born to thee. He's talking to
[18:50] David. Who shall be a man of rest. I
[18:54] actually learned that Solomon is shalom
[18:56] or shalom. It comes from the word rest.
[18:58] Shalom. And it says, "And I will give
[19:00] him rest from all his enemies
[19:02] roundabout. For his name shall be
[19:05] Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet
[19:07] unto Israel in his own days." So the
[19:10] very own name Solomon is being described
[19:11] here. He shall build an house for my
[19:14] name, and he shall be my son, and I will
[19:19] be his father. And I will establish the
[19:21] throne for his kingdom over Israel
[19:23] forever. Now my son, the Lord be with
[19:26] thee, and prosper thou, and build the
[19:29] house of the Lord thy God, and he as as
[19:31] he hath said of thee. Just beautiful to
[19:35] know that, you know, there's a house
[19:36] being built today and there's a son and
[19:38] that there's a man of rest and that we
[19:41] know there's a greater than Solomon
[19:42] here,
[19:44] &gt;&gt; man. Luke 767 says, "And the scribes and
[19:46] the Pharisees watched
[19:49] whether watched him whether he would
[19:51] heal on the Sabbath day that they might
[19:54] find an accusation against him." And I
[19:56] put these two scriptures together here
[19:57] because I just want to say I'm thankful
[19:59] that the Lord will heal me on a Saturday
[20:01] that will heal me on a Sabbath that will
[20:03] bring us the healing and he was not
[20:05] ashamed to be the Lord of the of the
[20:08] Sabbath. And I just think it's beautiful
[20:10] here because
[20:12] it says here in Matthew 12:8, for the
[20:15] son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath
[20:18] day.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Son of man said so rescue of the soul.
[20:23] I'm going to wrap up here. Matthew
[20:25] 11:29, "Take my yoke upon you and learn
[20:28] of me, for I am meek and lonely in load
[20:31] in heart,
[20:33] and ye shall find rest unto your souls."
[20:36] Amen.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; It's not just the rest, but it's the
[20:39] soul rest.
[20:41] In Psalm 62,
[20:44] favorite of mine, it says, "My soul
[20:47] wait." And that word wait, it actually
[20:48] means rest as well. It says, "My soul
[20:52] wait
[20:54] thou only upon God for my expectation is
[20:58] from him. He only is my rock and my
[21:02] salvation. He is my defense. I shall not
[21:05] be moved."
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll speak just briefly about
[21:08] Jubilee because um there's also a rest
[21:11] um that it was promised and it says in
[21:14] Leviticus 25:10, "And ye shall haul the
[21:18] 50th year and proclaim liberty
[21:21] throughout all the land into the
[21:22] inhabitants thereof. It shall be a
[21:25] jubilee unto you, and you shall return
[21:27] every man unto his possession." You to
[21:29] return to your land. You should return
[21:31] every man to his own family, unto his
[21:34] family. And I think that's where we rest
[21:36] is because the Lord's calling us home.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; He's calling us into his jubilee. I
[21:40] think the believer entered into to me it
[21:43] was real special that the first service
[21:44] I came here was literally on the
[21:46] celebration of the 50th appearance of
[21:48] the cloud to me. I heard this message as
[21:51] a here's your jubilee. Here's your shout
[21:55] and the mark of the beast. We know
[21:57] brother Benham here in the message it
[21:59] says and it says here now get back to
[22:02] our type. Now there was a beautiful type
[22:05] given and I wish to start with today the
[22:07] marking of the beast. Uh it says now in
[22:10] the old testament the bible said that
[22:12] there was to be a 50th jubilee that was
[22:15] seven times seven years and in the 40th
[22:18] night year that it was to be made ready
[22:21] and the 50th year was the jubilee year.
[22:24] 50th means jubilee. It was 50 is God's
[22:27] jubilee number. The word pentecost means
[22:30] 50. It was the outpouring of the Holy
[22:32] Spirit and the end of the 50th day. I
[22:37] was also it was also at the end of the
[22:40] 50th year. Amen. Just typifying there
[22:42] what it's going to be. Isaiah 61. The
[22:44] spirit of the Lord God is upon me. And
[22:46] here's the same thing to proclaim
[22:48] liberty to proclaim the acceptable year
[22:50] of the Lord. So when the Lord comes by
[22:52] your way, he's giving you that jubilee.
[22:54] And the believer's rest in it says here
[22:57] in this hour it is precept upon my
[22:59] precept, line upon line, hear a little,
[23:00] there a little, hold fast to that which
[23:02] is good. For with the stammering lips
[23:04] and other tongues will I speak to this
[23:06] people and this is the refreshing. Amen.
[23:10] This is the rest that shall come from
[23:12] the presence of the Lord. Remember he
[23:14] told Moses, "Go, my presence will be
[23:16] with you and I will give you rest." And
[23:18] then here we have um speaking about rest
[23:21] and how it says at the bottom. Oh, what
[23:23] is he? The one that comes in you gives
[23:26] you peace, your sign, your comforter at
[23:28] your in your rest. And here I love
[23:30] because it says
[23:32] the bottom it says when we enter into
[23:34] God, we rest all the time. Not from
[23:38] Sunday, not from one Sunday to another.
[23:40] We rest eternal. We got eternal life.
[23:43] The Holy Spirit gives you rest. Amen.
[23:46] And here's talking about stones. On the
[23:48] top it talks about stones that were
[23:50] offense and of laughing and of stumbling
[23:52] and of uh but here we talk about it says
[23:55] but for the church a precious load stone
[23:58] to the believer a stone of assurance a
[24:00] stone of rest oh mine resting I know
[24:03] that I have passed from death unto life
[24:05] my soul is at rest oh come unto me all
[24:08] that labor and heavy laden and I will
[24:11] give you rest see it was a sign to be
[24:13] evil spoken of talking about how prophet
[24:16] uh spoke to uh Mary Simeon And he spoke
[24:18] to Mary and saying that the same stone
[24:20] was going to be what is it spoke about
[24:22] before Christ the stumbling stone to the
[24:25] world and it was going to be uh speaking
[24:27] against but to us he's a stone of rest
[24:30] and then here it says but it will be an
[24:32] assurance it will be a love it will be a
[24:34] satisfaction and it will be something
[24:36] that you know you've passed from death
[24:38] unto life this is that scripture of
[24:40] Simeon and 5:24 verily verily I say unto
[24:44] you he that heareth my word and
[24:47] believeth believeth on him that sent me
[24:49] hath everlasting life, and shall not
[24:52] come unto condemnation, but is
[24:56] is pass from death unto life. Amen. Rest
[24:58] in Jesus.
[25:00] Rest from all works. Amen. God bless
[25:03] you, brothers. [applause]
