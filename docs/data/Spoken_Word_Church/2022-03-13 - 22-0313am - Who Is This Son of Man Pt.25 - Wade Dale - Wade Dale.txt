standing on holy grounds it kind of came from our bible study we just it turned into a testimony service and everybody was talking about how god had protected them through the years through different times amen and you know i'm sure we all have testimonies that way and i i have one that way as well and this was once i was working in downtown baltimore and was um it was about four lanes of highway that i had to go across and um i didn't know the last lane was a turning lane so the lights were getting ready to change and i thought i'd just run across and i was running across just looking where i was going because i knew the cars were getting ready to go but i didn't realize that last lane was a turning lane and they had that green light and i was running and something just stopped me i didn't see this car but i stopped and a car went i said lord god my goodness thank the lord standing on holy ground angels all around amen praise the lord and that's part of our story victory in jesus we heard this we heard this story but we're now part of it by his grace amen let's sing 22. i heard an old story how a savior came from glory how he gave his life on calvary to savor it's like me i heard about his groaning of his precious blood [Music] then i repented of my sins and won the victory of victory in jesus my savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood [Music] [Music] he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood i heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lame to walk again and he caused a blind to see and then i cried dear jesus come and heal my broken spirit and somehow jesus came and brought to me the victory oh victory oh in jesus my savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me i knew him and all my love is due him he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood i heard about a mansion he has built for me and glory and i heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea about the angels singing in the orientation story and some sweet day i'll sing up there the song of victory oh victory lesson oh jesus oh my savior forever sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me oh i knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing floor oh victory oh in jesus my savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me i knew him and all my love is to him he plundered me to victory beneath [Music] the other sudden we were going home we got in snail ville and we stopped at the light and we had a turning light and as soon as we took off somebody else took off from somewhere else that wasn't supposed to be and uh i thought afterwards i said how did i do that now i got thinking i didn't he did he saved me because it happened so fast i couldn't have never done it but uh because when i tried to take my foot off the accelerator and put on the brake it slipped off the brake and so god just brought us through it yeah yeah that's right we're gonna read this morning from psalm 27 let us pray heavenly father we ever grateful and thankful love for your being with us love protecting

only one service brother matthew will be with us that day and then also remember the next weekend that brother bob will be doing both services um myself sister june um brother luis and his wife and brother board are going to ohio to dedicate the the church part up there and the brother isaac's house so just remember us keep us in prayer but brother bob will be doing not just coming sunday but the next sunday the 27th i believe it is also remember that april the 15th 16th and 17th we'll have our first annual easter service um brother jewelfornia be here on friday night brother homer longoria will be here on saturday at three o'clock it'll be a regular fellowship meeting we'll be telling you about food and all that you'll need to bring and then that we will also have a birthday

on that afternoon so just keep all these things any prayers be um and all these brothers that are sick and brother homers have got to go the 16th i think it is to have his um heart cath roto-rootered out he's already had the heart cath but uh he had some calcium deposits talked about luke gibson the other day he's doing okay and uh he said to keep him in prayer so and he may be bringing the group with him too he said just pray for him so let's go to john 1 this will be part 25 i want to i want to insert something in here today we've been reading about the adoption and about what happens in the end time but let's look at the part that says we're predestinated to adoption now i know we as believers especially here in this church we know the true meaning of predestination it's not god pulled you through a tube god didn't make you do anything but by foreknowledge those who he foreknew so what comes first predestination no for knowledge comes first god foreign so he could predetermine what's going to happen before the foundation of the world because he's god amen and he knows the end from the beginning he knows what you'd do if you'd done something different hello that makes him infinite amen we're finite we can't understand that but maybe we can get a little bit understanding today about this predestinated to adoption and remember this predestination is your journey predestinated is the promise predestination is the journey predetermined destiny that's your journey but the predestinated is the promise the predestinated have a promise if you're predestinated you've got a promise you're going to make it because god saw you make it amen so what a comfort we have in that so let's go to john 1 and let's bow our heads the heavenly father we thank you for this day lord that you give us we pray now that you would be with us in the service lord we've sang the songs we've done the part that we need to do for the preliminary now pray lord that you come among us in a special way anoint us lord for this journey that we're on you do the speaking father and let us all hear from you today lord be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us ones in ukraine and different ones brother barry going over there lord we pray that you should protect him put your hand on him and lord may help the people father i pray that you'd be with the ones that are on the highways the ones that are traveling be with them lord and take care of them bring them back together lord what is one in you just be your brother aaron there maybe before he's changing the tire on the side of the road please keep him safe lord i pray that you'll get him here real quick father we pray lord that you'll just be with our pastor touch him because the deacons and elders and all the different ones the ministers in the church lord we pray that you keep your hand on us lord in jesus name we pray amen i also remember sister june you know her dad um he'll be 89 in november but he's lost his sight he had a stroke and um the doctor told him this week that he probably wouldn't get any better so that's that's probably uh um well the lord knows better you know okay that's just the doctor saying that his vision is not coming back so jen and her brother are taking time because you can't feed itself because you can't see to eat so she's over there for five days and then rex would be for five so just keep reading prayer we all promised we'd take care of our older people so so we will do that and uh a good it was good to have it's good to have him around for 88 years anyway and not have any of them go in a nursing home so that's wonderful in itself so just remember them sister regina's with her too so they're over there i think they may be watching in here in a little bit but let's read our our scripture john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and then we'll get to this in just a minute romans 8 verse 14 for as many that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have not received the spirit of bondage unto fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry abba father and you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word and today i want you to turn if you want to or you can walk look at it on the on the screen but i had to bring out my old bible i've got notes from like that i wrote so many notes in my old bible sometimes i have to bring it back out so we want to go to the book of ephesians and let's talk about i know some of the ministers have been there too but we're going to go through it really slow ephesians 1 through about 14. that's all right amen i want you to look at what god now remember predestination is the journey predestinated is the promise all right predestination is the journey predestinated is the promise all right and we are pre-next predestinated to adoption according to ephesians we've been reading it that we are predestinated to adoption and remember that we were talking about just as they were putting that up dispensation i've been reading too brother branham talks a lot about dispensations and stages and i want to clear something up and i really appreciate people that are they're watching online when they send emails there was a brother sent me an email this morning and he said you said that luther and wesley were prophets well a prophet is who the word comes to you've got my major prophets and minor prophets you got prophets in the five-fold ministry now we know that lutheran wesley were was reformers but did not the word come to lutheran wesley it wasn't three or four preachers in the s that had to say uh luther brought the just shall live by faith he was the prophet of that day though it may be partial though it may be a reformer that he didn't have all the loose ends tied up but that had to come in the promise of the end time of the luke 17 30 the revelations 10 7 the malachi 4 5 there was a major prophet to come in the end time to tie everything up but when luther preached the judge shall live by faith that's the same judgment justification you live by not different holy ghost and luther had the holy ghost all those messengers listen those were seven stars in the hand of god those must be pretty special people amen all right so when you say their prophets then i could call i could call you a prophet the prophet's who the word comes to but each there were seven predestinated by predestination they were predestinated to come in luther's age and he was the one that had the word for the agent if you if you turn luther down you turn god down so he was the prophet for that day wesley was a prophet i've got some quotes in here where brother brown i know he says they're reformers and that's fine they are because they didn't have all the word but they were still prophets to their age they were ones that stood up and god said if you don't hear that guy you're not going to make it to me that's a prophet amen now they they had their flaws and they had their um uh you know father some holy ghost baptism they couldn't put it all together but they were they were prophets enough to where you had to listen to what he said they were identified in the scriptures reading where brother brown talks about only in the end time will we be able were we able to name those yes we were not able to name you know wesley probably didn't stand up and say i'm the sixth messenger of the stat of the star of the hand of god no he just knew he had a message but he took a prophet in the end time a major prophet in the end time to go back in the word of god and bring out and say all right here we've got paul irenaeus martin why didn't we pick polycarp he explains why he didn't pick polycarp so he's bringing out see luther couldn't do that wesley couldn't do that but the prophet in the end time did do that so when i when i said lutheran wesley were prophets i meant they were prophets they were prophets for their time you know what you wouldn't got to heaven without luther's message in luther's time to me that's a prophet prophet is who the word comes to a man so the word came to luther in that church age all right everybody okay with that we know the reformers we know that they didn't have everything but they had enough to where god said you're going to listen to this man or you're not going to get it amen so to me that's good enough that's one of them seven stars in the hand of god i'd like to be considered one of the seven stars in the hand of god wouldn't you amen so we consider him a prophet messenger not like the one we got but one that's different than the clergy of the day look who he protested the world catholicism was all spreading like wildfire in here stands a man that says no you don't have to do novenia's you don't have to crawl on your hands and knees you don't have to see a priest you don't have he went against the whole world so i thank god that god said sent us a prophet that the same thing happened he was against the whole world and the whole world's against us same thing so god bless you and let's do this right here so in dispensations and stages we know that we're in a time now of the pre-predestinated to adoption let's let's read this if you want to i want you to look how personal god give this in the book of ephesians remember ephesians was what very mature corinthians they were all he was always trying to say look guys y'all don't need to be drinking at the at the lord's supper table and you don't need to be marrying your mother your stepmother and you don't need to be doing this you don't need to be doing that but now the ephesians watch what he does first thing he says he says paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus now that was the people that were there and i like this next one and to the faithful in christ jesus that's us that's us from from paul speaking this to today we are the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ now watch how this scripture unfolds now we look and see that adoption is in three stages the new birth is in three stages as bob's been talking about the attachment perfect man everything comes in threes three stages of this three polls three the three that everybody got that so we're staying in the three so in the mind of god this is what's happening so watch this is before time this is a prophet called paul that's picking up the mind of god before the foundation of the world because watch i'm going to read it blessed be the god and father of my lord jesus christ who has blessed now look i everywhere god god wrote this paul wrote it but we know god wrote it look it's us and we and us and we look at all these different things that that we see that god has given us in this end time but i want you to look at the predict when i say predestinated by to adoption this is the reason because watch blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who is blessed every time you see that red we'll just pronounce it with me blessed one more time blessed that's pretty good with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ now brother brown said that was a believer's position are we not trying to find our position all right you got to find out you're born again first once you find out you're born again first then you can start growing in god some of us are just growing physically but i want to grow up in god amen so this remember this is in heaven according as he has chosen us in him when us and him before i don't have to stop at that us you just say us when i say that okay that makes it really class participation according to he has chosen in him before the foundation of the world that that was weak that should be holy keep you awake we should be holy and without blame before him in love now look that's what god said about you today we sit here today we are not the holiest people in the world outside man middle man memory reason conscious affection but that's not what god saw that's not what god saw god saw this thing already done but then remember we've got to come down here according as he has chosen then you're getting it in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love look having predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what brother brown say his will was his will is his word today you are listening to the reading of the will of a testator that died to give you something but remember our inheritance was before the foundation of the world everybody okay with that jesus didn't come to bring us an inheritance i'm telling you where your inheritance was at having predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will which is will is his word to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved that's jesus christ this is my beloved son and who i am pleased to dwell that's your new birth that's what we're talking about today we're talking about the new birth we're going to get to it just a bit what we were talking about this yesterday i mean last sunday so now look but we've got to come down here listen redemption i want you to listen to what i'm saying redemption was thought of in heaven the plan of redemption was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but it had to unfold in its natural part because revelations 13 8 i believe it says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world but he had to literally come down here and die on the cross because redemption in his finish point finishes down here redemption doesn't finish in heaven redemption finishes down here in its natural form you we have to play out this act that was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world everybody okay so now here we are on earth verse seven in whom that was weak in whom have redemption through his blood now remember he died in the mind of god two thousand years i mean 25 million billion years ago but 2 000 years ago he literally did this and that's what we believe in listen i can't listen i can take the mind of god and believed that that was in the mind of god but he had to do it 2000 years ago so i can see it here on earth so i can believe that that man did literally shed his blood literally hang on a cross for me and you amen and who most in whom have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins plural sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto the mystery of his will having made known to us not the world the mystery of his will and the mystery of his will is what brother ram says to adopt us okay so that's the mystery of the that's the whole mystery that you come down through time and even paul and all the different ones they speak of adoption they give you types and shadows but it's only supposed to happen in the end time it's on because we did have a major prophet that brought the word back listen god cannot work through false doctrine that's the key it's like brother bob was talking one word eve one word put every hospital that's right on a corner put every cemetery out in the field one word so don't you think one word's not gonna be important to get us out of here so god had to send us a word prophet he had to send a major prophet but well now we have that major prophet's message and the anointing to go with it and then that makes me a new prophet brother brown said we are prophetic people is that what he said if we're prophetic people we ought to be able to see like he saw you say oh brother branham was the eagle and he sure he was he was the one that came to maturity first he was the one that went up higher to look and see he was the one that looked over the fence but what did he do he come back and told us what was over the fence amen so now we have to take and go okay we know what's over the fence we know the revelation of what's going on so on earth it's where our redemption is but let watch have it made no unto the mystery of that was weak the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself pre-determined destiny because he saw it in his mind and brother branham stood one day and said let's go back into the back part of god's mind he said let's go back there he didn't say i'm just going back there he said let's go back in the back part of god mind god's mind and see this great mystery this great purpose of why we're here and he preached christ is the mystery of god revealed one of the greatest one sermons he ever preached in his life amen having made known unto the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself look that in the dispensation of the fullness of times in other words the past 2 000 years we've got dispensation of every church age all the way up to today this dispensation is for the adoption of children and to grow up in god that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which on earth even in him and whom also have obtained an inheritance oh no brother way we were just this great uh from the foundation i mean from the time we were born we were just this seed and we were just this eternal person and we had this eternal life baloney the things i did when i was growing up god didn't have nothing to do with that amen god will not dwell in an unclean vessel but now in the mind of god as we read that scripture before the foundation of the world verse 1 through 6 god saw that we would want it so he gave it to us amen had it waiting on us so yes there was an eternal seed but you weren't born with it you had to obtain it you had to fight for it to me that's so easy so easy to understand if you'll if you'll separate it to where you've we we've got a message that is so prophetic that it takes the mind of god but it takes the mind of god and brings it down so that individuals can understand it that just common people can understand but see the great minds of the world and the great minds of sometimes in the message overlook those simple things and listen i'm telling one word we're not we don't get a uh we get a grace card but we don't get what they all say in golf they call it a mulligan you get one stroke that you don't have to deal with well we don't do that none of the bride is going to take a body change i'll promise you you don't get one we've got to take a body change according to this next one we're going to read down here when we get to it am i okay so ephesians 1 1 through 6 is in god in the mind of god before time before the foundation of the world you've got to get into be the faithful in christ jesus so we got to come to redemption on earth and we've got to come to full redemption the fullness of times not just part luther had part wesley had part but you and i are going to have to bring it all together in the fullness of this time and we're gonna have to take a body chain somebody will it won't be a billion people it'll only take one that's right it'll only take one i'm praying there's more but it'll only take one person one jesus stood and brought lazarus out of the grave and brother brown said if he hadn't called lazarus by name he said the whole all the old testament people would have resurrected how powerful is that in whom also y'all sleep already and him also that's better obtained an inheritance look being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after what the counsel of his will or his word amen he cannot he listen this bible sure was written before the foundational world but it had to be unfolded down here amen there had to be an elijah there had to be an isaiah there had to be an abraham they had to be a a literal person because if we're coming to the revelation of the son of man i thought that was god in human flesh that wasn't god in spirit form that was god in humans yes having the preeminence that's right been dealing on that a little bit this this week you talk about preeminence now you've got to remember we have a life to live man when we first come in the message they were you know there was doctrine flying everywhere but boy there was there were some really some people that were really i mean they were like zombies they didn't want to do you know and kick the tv out we know all that but the preeminence has got to start from any side it can't be a do and a don't it's got to come from inside that's why we got to look at the inside teacher that's why we got to have teachers and tutors and governors to teach us because listen folks we're all contrary to god you were born contrary to god so don't talk to me about being special god's not a respecter of persons we were all born dead lost but we had predestination we had the foreknowledge of god to know that we would want it that's right amen that we would want it and want nothing else but that and the preeminence would be that we put god first in everything we do not that we walk around we have to pray with our eyes closed the bible says pray without ceasing you can pray without ceasing with your eyes open amen the bible says jesus looked up in heaven and prayed he was looking all right so well you know we think we have to close our eyes but we don't have to close our eyes to pray we can be in a constant state of preeminence if we'll just listen to what he has to say and we've got life to live folks we've got jobs to do we've got all this other stuff but are we listening to what god tells us you watch bob meddled wednesday night i'm gonna meddle a little bit this morning you watch there's two things that you watch if somebody don't pay their time they struggle with money all the time don't think you can hide amen and number two you watch people when they start having problems they quit coming to church the very thing you're not supposed to do you're giving preeminence to somebody else this is where you need to be fight your way to church you'll get something [Applause] find your way don't come to me with problems and uh something on facebook the other day that was talking about um something about you know well said i'm not getting fed it's all about spiritually and the commentator said well you ought to come to where you eat in other words he was saying if you come to church you get fed if you stay away i mean if you say well i'm malnourished but there's gold and corral sitting in your parking lane your attack your house is attached to the golden corral and you're starving to death brother dale likes golden corral so do i that's where you get your food well guess where you get your food amen and it's not just press play you need an atmosphere you need a place that people get together sheep have to get together because we're hurt animals amen and we're stronger together what does what is the first thing that a lion or a wolf or a fox anything even something small what's the first thing they do they cut them away from the herd they find one they can't get 20 people at one time or 20 animals sorry at one time so he'll pick one he'll pick that one and don't go to church much and don't pay their time but don't read their bible but don't pray so do the vice versa you know that's a quote brother brown said if you're stingy give stuff away he said just do the vice versa he said if you're having a problem and if you have a problem with this just don't do it it's pretty simple but it it's really profound i guess to get people to get to church but anyway that we that we should be to the praise of his glory first trusted in christ in whom oh you can say we because that ye is we and whom also trusted look after did you trust god when he was in the world no you trusted your own ability you didn't pray about stuff when you was out in the world no you didn't i thank you no you didn't just plain that's your sister would say the same thing no you wouldn't no you didn't you didn't ask god about the things you did when you was a sinner no right but after that you heard the word of truth you had to hear the word you didn't just come up and say i'm just in the message i had this seed down inside of me and boy just i just feel it now well you feel it all right but after you heard the word of truth listen you have to hear the word to be justified you have to hear the word to be sanctified and you have to hear the word of god to receive the baptism of the holy ghost you cannot receive it just sitting under a tree and not heard of god ever that's right because what are you going to connect to what are you going to repent to who are you going to repent too if you don't know how to repent of god godly sorrow leads you to repentance what's godly sorrow you coming to church are you getting under conviction somebody telling you about the lord amen that all right in whom we also trusted after that heard the word of truth so you got to hear truth the gospel of your salvation and whom after look in whom also after that believed we're sealed with that holy spirit of promise [Applause] there's your journey that's what we're going to look at we're going to look at about going across we're and we'll not get to it today because we're going to try to keep it a little bit short but we're going to get into joshua and then when they got ready to go into the promised land listen they went through the wilderness of sin why do you think they called it the wilderness of sin because they were coming under sanctification what was god doing he was trying to get away he was trying to get the trash out all this demons you read it or somebody ready where brother brown was talking about their everyone dead those people those old fighters those old people that came out of egypt had to die because god couldn't work them they were always murmuring always complaining i mean my heavens what a social program he fed them three meals a day clothed their their clothes didn't wear out what miracles couldn't a man look at his kid and say that baby's got on the same clothes and he's 14 years old that kind of baby got on the same clothes it did when it was a baby did not the bible said their clothes did not wear out nor their sandals and they walked for 40 years in the same shoes walmart would be out of business if that happened this time but you know what that's what we're heading back to you don't think in eternity we're going to have to trade our shoes sorry rich where's richard sorry richard no goodwill no good will in heaven sorry about that richard loves go to goodwill and get them secondhand things that's all right there's nothing wrong with that all right and who ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation look how personal this whole ephesians 1 is he's trying to get you to see that god's working through you and with you all right you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now watch now we're going to the future which would be romans 8 23 we're going to get to eventually verse 14 says which is the earnest of our inheritance now an earnest that's right here this is the earnest today you're sitting in the earnest of your inheritance if you're born again even if you're not born again you're going to get an inheritance it ain't going to be good but you're going to get one which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession until the praise of his glory what is the purchase possession your body change is to purchase possession that's why some have to go by the grave but guess what they're going to pick up that body they were living in god's going to change that body change the atoms make it 20 years old it's going to have to respond to what's in that curtain of time because what's inside of you i'm telling you it's more powerful than what's on the outside of you because when they come back up they're not going to brother robert tatum's not going to come back up in the 80 something year old body no but when he got born again he got a 20 year old body his theophany inside of him inside of you today listen have you ever thought about this i was thinking about this yesterday i'm talking about the new birth if you really realize what happens at the new birth what god's done to get you where you're at have you ever thought about it sit down think about it if you're not born again you don't have a lot to think about except getting born again so listen if you decide you're not born again that's a good point the ones that think they're born again the ones in trouble that are not but if you ever just sit and realize that look when you were in the world and you did the things of the world the bible said the love of the father was not in you that bear okay with that even if you sit in a messy church for 30 years and didn't do all the things of the world you were still worley you always want to sneak around and do this or sneak around and do am i hitting something sneak around do this and sneak around and do that remember them them little bob blacks kids they just so precious devils that's the box of that's right [Laughter] i'm just joking breathe breathe zoe breathe can't embarrass her boys your face gets red but we were we were born in a sin shape and iniquity we were bound on our way to hell and our soul was black it was the devil it was the nature of this world the nature of the demons of this world you see what the demons are doing now don't you my lord they're in everything you can't really hardly have a lot of preeminence minds you you see this preeminent uh billboard now they got them to change they change from one naked woman to another one you can't turn your head because you see another one but god knew we would make it in this age so don't make it's not an excuse but think what god did at your new birth he took that soul now i want you to understand something what is making you think today what is making me move my hand today is my soul it is not my body something's having to tell that body to move there is a firing mechanism or some sort of whatever you want to call it electrical charge that's going on in you right now be a little bit unplugged but um plug it back in maybe that's what we need to get this little plug in we plug it back in but that fire mechanism that is a soul that's a life that's a person this help that's making you do it's even making you think thoughts that you're thinking now we know that memory reason conscious affects an imagination remember we're not born again in that that realm all right because of the bad thoughts that we have and we still have problems we still got to go up the statue of perfect man but inside your soul if you're born again today god not an angel god himself resides in your soul god himself not a second person not a third person not an angel god the creator resides in your soul that's what you need after you heard the word of god the gospel of your salvation after you heard that you didn't know anything about it until you heard it how did you get how did you come under conviction well god he he just he just no you were sitting somewhere listening or you were sitting somewhere listening to what a preacher said six months ago but something comes to you of what you heard amen isn't that how you had you did your bad stuff at out in the world you leaned to what you heard you leaned to what you saw but now we lean to what god inside of us is and what the word is but listen to get in your soul he had to do a work he had to do something it's not just automatic that's what i say about and god forbid it is easy but it's not that easy to just say well i believe the message so i reckon that that seed just popped to life and no you it says after after you heard the word of truth after you come to this new birth god starts dealing with you why because before that you were contrary to god you were as black as night as the song says yours my soul was as black as night but darkness has taken flight what that had to go out of you as in the book of luke says the unclean spirit goes out of a man that's in sanctification that's not it's a new birth because remember the children of israel will get to this afternoon the children of israel were the children of israel but they had to take a journey and their journey was not in the type of the holy ghost hello their wilderness journey was sanctification not in the promised land amen justification was they came out of egypt but they had a mixed multitude with them they had the unbelievers they had the real believers they had some that wasn't even born yet that were believers later on we'll get to it this afternoon but then the wilderness of sin god had to start shedding the unbelievers that's at your sanctification that's not within your birth do not get caught in the wilderness of sin and you keep going satan loves for you to take that death walk indian death walk round and round and round in the same they went 40 years and they should have been in the promised land in about three days don't you think they went to the same place 40 times at least and 2 million people and cows and donkeys and everything else well they strung out probably five miles just the people and the animals and the carts and the and the tents and all that other stuff that they had and they walked around just like me and you the devil puts on death mark but you know what one day somebody stood up and said hey we ain't going that way anymore joshua and caleb said no we're we're not going we're going that way we're going to go to that mountain jake i mean caleb said give me my mountain amen we'll get to that this afternoon but in the future which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession until the praise was glory and then when we get to romans 8 verse 23 you've got to come to adoption first you got to come to your birth you got to have your journey we're talking about positioning placing people come to adoption where your name is as good on the checkbook as god's is it is now potentially but he's not going to give you the checkbook and you're not ready for it amen we're not going to give the keys to the car to morty as we did the other day brother john's still sweating over there but we're not going to give the keys to the car to a kid and god knows more than we do about when we're ready to get it but he knew somebody would be ready to get it because he had the keys and the car ready hey man he just wants us to get in there and drive it but you know what driving in the right way because power without character satanic i see that more than ever and ever power without character will make you do things that you i mean even at the even at new birth ungodly temper compromise on the word of god as bob was talking about wednesday night there's no room for compromising none and if it separates us i was talking to brother rush just a few minutes ago he was talking about if the son of man if we're supposed to have the son of man ministry which i've been preaching for 20 something sermons it's going to make you different it's going to make the world hate you and they're going to actually crucify us not on a cross like jesus he already done that we don't have to go there anymore but spiritually he's crucified why did brother brown stand up one day and sigh and die this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ they didn't put him on a cross physically spiritually they put him on a cross they made his they made his first listen to me they made his first crucifixion of not a fact we don't believe that because of our tradition this is what we believe so they they put him spiritually back on the cross are we doing the same thing that's my question to you are we killing him again by our doctrines by our habits our ways of things that we do that we're not supposed to be doing amen come on people which is the earnest of our inheritance what's the earnest the down payment your new birth as i was saying a minute ago brother brown talks about vulcanizing everybody understand that brother brown one time he talks about vulcanized everybody know what vulcanizing is not the young kids they love all them looked up when i say that they go used to used to there was a tube inside of your tire everybody tire t-i-r-e in you on your car even on your bicycle and your four-wheeler and all that other stuff you got it right everybody okay in the polaris and all that they're not anymore they they're usually tubeless now but when you had a tube and it got a hole in it you didn't throw the see that's why we're so disposable now we just throw the tire away and just have to buy a new tire i don't know do they sell even sell do they still sell them tubes you have to probably probably find them because they used to they were everywhere i mean convenience stores everybody sold tubes because everybody needed them but you take that tube and it's made out of what rubber all right then they sell you a patch that's made out of rubber then they give you some glue and to make it really stick you light it and it burns the glue gets it really hot and then you take that patch which is rubber and the tube which is rubber and you put them together and what happens it vulcanizes in other words it melts into the rubber and it makes it one makes it actually now stronger because it's double layer stronger than it was when it first started that's the way god did us it's a new birth we had a hole in ourself it was called the devil we had a hole in our tube now predestinated in the mind of god yeah god has to give everybody a soul yes everybody with me today god gives you a soul now you it's you what determines what to do what you're going to do with it adolf hitler had a soul but he left it black he didn't ask for any kind of forgiveness everybody okay with this but you one day when you got down on your knees you said god i don't want to live this way anymore i got too many holes in my tire i put air in it goes it goes flat i'm tired of the way i'm living aaron was probably amber probably wished he had a patch when he's out there on the road i hate about listen i pray for people when they have um tire trouble because i don't like that i have to change all that on the side of the road and somebody knock you down and kill you so you've got a saw but it's black but it's a soul it's something god can work with it's rubber but it's got a hole in it and you've and you've you've tried because see you might want to stick a piece of wood in it you might want to take a band-aid like one time before a long time ago when we had bicycles we used to try to take we didn't have duct tape back then but we had the black electrical tape you take that electrical tape and you try your best to get that hole to close up but when you say man this is good and then you put put you put the pressure to it guess what david but you had to find something that had a soul also that could fix you that's why the bible tells we need to be we're going to be filled with the holy ghost and fire and fire the patch came the patch came down and gave his life for you so that you could ask him to fill your hole to fill your cup but it took rubber it took a man with an eternal soul to give you eternal life that's why it had to be jesus christ that's why he had to be almighty god that's why he wasn't a second person to a trinity that's why he wasn't just a mere human even though he was a human but inside of him was rubber and by the fire of the holy ghost he burnt that old you out killed it if you let him killed it not divorced it we talked about that before you sisters you can't marry if you have a living husband guess what i'm not talking about just you women i'm talking about us the bride of jesus christ can't have 12 living husbands right he's got to be what dead d-e-a-d dead and once he's dead you're free to marry you're free to vulcanize and let the holy ghost in fire put that patch on and listen never ever ever will he get a hole in it again never will it get a hole in it because look that's our inheritance but that's just your earnest that's the down payment that's not the full possession the full possession is that we are going to become god on the outside not just god on the inside we're going to become god on the outside and that potential is lying here today in each and every one of us look which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory now let's read them quoting in the token i hope you understood that look in your bibles that's why i brought my old bible because i got notes written everywhere but um see before the foundation of the world when god saw all this as brother brown said he took a picture of you when you were 20 years old and at your new birth you were changed i thought you were a new creation he recreated you and now that soul inside of you is not 60 years old 70 years old 40 years old it's 20 years old because if it's eternal it can't be old i thought i just said you got eternal life at your new birth the eternal's not old eternal's young that's what you've got in you already let it out let it out and the only way you can let it out is you let it out because god's not going to do it but god took a picture and he saw each and every one of us before we were even born and what is a myth what is the mystery this great mystery paul said christ in you the hope of glory christ in you for you to realize what you already have in your possession but it's just the earnest it's the earnest the down payment until the purchase possession it was a down payment when they come out of israel when the children of israel came out of egypt that was a down payment because they hadn't got there yet but somebody was going to because there was a promise there was a promised land that they was made a promise somebody was going to live in that promised land now god knew all them people he took care of for 40 years fed them watered them clothed them protected them he knew none of them was going to make it but two joshua and caleb that's the only ones that were going to make it but they were predestinated because god saw joshua would stand up and say we can take that place and caleb stood up and he didn't even just say that he said what are y'all talking about remember he kept set up stood up in front of them 10 and said shut up remember that sermon i preached about 20 years ago on 10 lion preachers there was 10 lion preachers they went across the promised land they've been in the message forever how many 40 years they went across and saw the land saw that brother brown preached attached to a perfect man saw that we're supposed to come to adoption saw that we're supposed to come to the opening of the seven seals and you know what the ten said we can't do it they lied they were lying preachers but joshua and caleb were not they said i'm not worried about them giants and i'm not worried listen them ten throw the circumstances out there buddy they're bigger than we are we're like grasshoppers we can't take this place joshua and caleb wasn't looking at that they were looking at a promise the promise that somebody was gonna cross that jordan river and get in that land and not just get in the land but possess it possess the gates of the enemy everybody all right let's read this real quick right here on the token the token is a sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted i've read this before but look made and been accepted we're accepted in the beloved who is what jesus christ but we have to be born again to be accepted because the devil he god's not going to adopt the devil's kids he's only going to adopt his kids because they're only ones in his line does everybody got that full complete obedience puts you in the word one you believe it every bit and all of it's in you not on you not something floating around beside of you but in you and you watch it working through you wow now let's go to the next one the next one says we were talking about the headstone the brother brown said the headstone's yet to come now he preached a message he preached a headstone message but the people were not there to receive it they'll be okay with that we read it over and over again her brother adam said it's not for you it's gone from you it's not for you to get anyway live a good christian life and in other words it'll be told later on who it's going to be and i believe it was me and you i believe it was somebody that had the right receptor that had the right crystal that was cut the right way amen all right let's go to galatians 4 1. next one now i say that the heir as long as he's a child difference nothing from a servant though he'd be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father we have to be taught these things let's go to number quote number three real quick and then we'll quit and come back this afternoon in the adoption series now look preaching catches the center brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is now what was joshua type of the holy ghost right joshua the man right now when he got him in the promised land they didn't just people fall over now we know one thing's for sure and i'll read it today a lot of the king says we're done you know remember rahab said when y'all crossed that river well it in other words the air just went out of our tube amen but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith now we have faith for healing we have faith for all these different things right but we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are we'll get to that a little bit later on to know what we are not just that we're the bride of jesus christ that's your new birth that's what should be told you it's in your birth there should be something inside of you say you're my child now and if you'll work with me i'll work with you and what a teacher does a teacher can only work listen anna all the anybody that's teaching it's you got to get a response you can tell everything you know in the book lay it out there do it just like they told you in college just lay it out there but if there's nobody there to receive it and some kid's going to get it and some kids are not going to get it if we didn't know they had a flat tire i'd say that they didn't change their clock like some of you other ones didn't you wait on that you waited on november though yeah november when you come to church and ain't nobody here you'll think the raptures took place no you just didn't change it you didn't change the clock number three that where we're at now all right let's go number four this set for this afternoon your adoption is not your birth we've already read that several times your adoption is your placing so what we were talking about we're going to talk about this afternoon the promised land was not where they wandered around where where did they wander the children of israel they wandered in the wilderness all right at least those 20 and under knew who they were because joshua and caleb told them who they were they listened to the messenger of the hour which told them about what we're going to what they're going to have to do how they're going to walk where they're going to be positionally placed and we'll get to that this afternoon but your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing so this is already in the land keep scrolling when you were born again john 1 17 i believe when you're born of the spirit of god we are sons of god but we were predestinated see but we were predestinated what to adoption we were predestinated to grow up yes now here's what i'm trying to get you to for this sons of the last day that's us we were predestinated unto adoption now here we are this is what hurts pentecost a little bit they say i got born again praise the lord god the holy ghost that's fine you're a child of god that's right but yet that ain't what i'm talking about wow so now he has he has took that and he has placed it over here he said this is not what i'm talking about so i'm not talking about the new birth i'm talking about your placing adoption is placing a son so let's go to read the romans 8 14 real quick and we'll skip through this a good bit but look for as many that are lit this is the first stage of adoption you've got to be born again you've got to have the birth that's what we were talking about the holy ghost and fire has got to burn the old you out and god himself not a second person like i said not an angel god he said oh well god's the angel of the covenant don't start with me god's a person and brother brown said the person of jesus christ comes to you with a new birth so the person a person the eternal person came to me and we vulcanized we vulcanized so much you the devil can't pull it apart and now god can pump the tire up and god can use your vessel or your vehicle to get where he needs to go all right look for as many as they're led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god first thing you got to do folks remember get born again to even start your adoption you can get partial some of these i believe in justification sanctification because that is god changing you it's sanctification it's a work of the holy ghost all right so you get partial of these but not the full god can't fully work through you if he's not in you i'm sorry he can give you an anointing but he never can work full that's why he didn't work through the pentecostal that much because they got an anointing a lot of times they didn't get the holy ghost for ye have not received the spirit of bondage and to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry out of a father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the composition that is that we are the children of god and as children than heirs we are the children of israel they stood up in egypt because we'll read something real quick they stood up in egypt and said we're the children of god we have a promise and we are not going to stay in egypt we went out of here because they were children then heirs what heirs of the promise and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we might be also glorified together now we know what the promise is acts 2 38 amen acts 2 38 says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and your children and them that are far off even as men as our lord our god shall call so that's the promise the promises in your birth but now let's look at something real quick let's go all the way down to if you don't mind go to number seven brothers can continue scrolling in and when we're born in the kingdom of god by jesus christ we're an heir of heaven join ours with jesus because he took our place he became us that we might become him all right now remember let's just read the bread god predestinated you by foreknowledge that you were coming to this everybody understand it raise your hand god by foreknowledge predestinated you to come to the promised land so there was a predestinated group of people that was headed toward the promised land but there was only two of them now these were predestinated to fall in the wilderness under justification and sanctification not to get into the promised land but there was a group predestinated to get into promised land and it was two plus the 20 and under that had been what raised up in the wilderness so now let's go to genesis 17 12. real quick this is what god said about circumcision and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you eight days why eight days eight days is eternity seven days is in time when you receive the new birth you step out of time your soul is in eternity as we read before a position in heavenly places in christ jesus now you're still here caught in this dimension but your soul is eternal and in eight days you shall be circumcised now what circumcision the type of the baptism of the holy ghost everybody got that say amen all right real quick and then we'll cover this we'll back up on this this afternoon let's go to joshua 5 1. it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which are on this side jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan what is jordan death you got to die to get in the promised land you got to die didn't i just say that your husband's got to be dead before the children of israel that we were until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel when you become a son and daughter of god satan's heart melts because number one he lost a good soldier and number two he knows you're gonna fight him and you he thinks he's gonna win but we know who wins now watch at that time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives whoa sharp two-edged sword now remember they just crossed jordan into the promised land they're right at the edge of the jordan they haven't been positionally placed yet everybody okay with that wake up thank you joshua made him sharp two-edged swords and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt that was the group that died everybody got that saying ma'am i'll be done in just a second now all the people that came out were circumcised that was coming from the world egypt their command was to get circumcised on the eighth day right right at the birth but they walked all this time god had to get rid of all them people the unbelievers and had to raise up a new group but that new group hadn't been circumcised yet it just come through justification and sanctification they're about right with that now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt then they had not circumcised for the children of israel walked 40 years in the wilderness to all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of god preeminence unto whom the lord swear that he would not show them the land which the lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead that's us that's we that's us not they and their children whom he raised up in their stead they were still children they were still children of israel they were just younger watch them joshua circumcised for they were circumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off of you hmm this is a circumcision in the promised land this is cutting off the old stuff after we already get in the promised land amen this day if i rolled away the republic of egypt from off you wherefore the name of this place is called gilgal until this day and the children of israel camped in gilgal and kept the passover in the 14th day of the month and even in plains of jericho go back go back down to verse verse 8. and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole why it hurt for you men we understand that if you get circumcised at 20 years old you're gonna walk different don't you walk different after the new birth don't you walk different after you get in the promised land god has to keep cutting the old foreskin off so that he can be made known but they had to wait until they were made whole so in other words so they could walk again same way with me and you when you get you get in the promised land you're going to flounder around a little bit amen you're going to make mistakes you're going to get sick you're going to get all these different things that maybe you had not got before i never was a sick person until after i received the new birth you know in my body amen but you know what that's okay i'll take it so let's read this verse 11 go back down to 11. now when they got into the promised land musicians come the children of israel and captain gilgal kept the passover in the 14th day of the month and even in plains of jericho they passed over jordan now what happened it was very significant they didn't eat what they ate in the wilderness anymore under justification and sanctification you had to hear a new message you had to eat of the old corn of the land the mantis ceased on the day they crossed over in other words their food ceased and then what happened they had to go out and harvest of the old corner of the land it wasn't god didn't just i mean you know you could stand here and just catch you a bucket full of kentucky fried chicken joe forney would be shouting at the moment papa yo you got that popeyes you ain't kidding popeye's best chicken in the world anyway that's no plug for popeyes they're not paying for this this is not a promotion but it is good but i mean really they just took their their bucket out in the morning and they piled it full of manna went back in rolled it up made made food out of it but god told him said look when you get in that promised land you're gonna have to eat different man you're gonna have to eat different you're gonna have to think different you're gonna have to talk different and you definitely have already started walking different that's right amen because of the circumcision so all that now we're in the promised land this afternoon we'll talk about the placing what joshua did to him but let's stand to our feet they eat the old corn of the land on the moral after the passover unleavened cakes and parts corn in the same day they started eating food that came from the ground they started eating food that they had to harvest but remember they didn't plant it they didn't plant it the people that were there planted it they took and ate it and it gave them nourishment [Music] we can have a message of eternal life but there's also a message of you moving on after your eternal life after you give receiving the new birth there's a promised land a positional placing joshua didn't just say you know joshua didn't just walk across jordan have all this great powerful thing going on and say all right y'all just have at it no [Music] god wanted them placed exactly where those mothers screamed their name he wanted to place because they did something in that part of their land that you can't do over here brother brown said our problem was is we're over in ephraim's field eating corn when we should be in our own field in manassa if manassas corn eat corn plant corn that's the positioning place
