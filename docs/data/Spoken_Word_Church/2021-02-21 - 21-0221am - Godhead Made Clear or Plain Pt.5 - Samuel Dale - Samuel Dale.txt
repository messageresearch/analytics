and then we'll go into the scripture father we thank you for a day in an hour that we have a time that we can call upon you that we can take a little time and just sit down and relax for a little bit and lord depend on you to come and speak to our hearts because that's our desires and father we ask you to bless each one remember the sick ones among us remember brother turn there and take care of that lord and all the others that are sick father just reach down and touch each one and your little bride around the world we crawl out for all of them lord because we got to promise that you said you wouldn't let anything happen to us that you wouldn't be there to take care of it so we depend upon that and we ask you to just bless now as we read your word and talk about you we ask you to just bless and guide each thing he's thought the points we try to make may it all be for you in jesus name amen matthew 28 verse 16. when the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubt it and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world you may be seated now remember this is after the resurrection so it is put to where all power he didn't say that back down through the time because you know there were things having to be made manifest in ways and like i've always said he was born lord to christ he was born the savior but he was not the healer he couldn't do that as a child so you have to wait until things comes into being and then after you come into the uh times of their of the river jordan and then you see the anointing came on him that made him the anointed messiah and then he was crucified and then he comes forth and says all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth all right so then it's all gathered into that point and uh i hope this series parts or thoughts has been some to help you to understand the godhead because that's my point i i want us to see the godhead but to see the godhead correctly because like i've always said we say uh you know oneness doctrine is uh you know the people thinking that jesus was the final immorphy i don't believe that i believe the bride of jesus christ is the final morphe for the gentile dispensation all right now it's him in us it's not us no it's him in us manifesting himself and making it known all right then trying to hold a point to where you can follow it and understand you know that we did in a couple of services talking about that god has always had a body he's never been without a body all right back before time ever began back in eternities et cetera or whatever uh he had a body you might have to call that a theophany or whatever but don't worry about it it's still a body and like i i tried to emphasize last week in the basis of the fact of that theophany body is way in a more powerful or real or whatever words you want to use than these natural bodies that we live in now so then it shouldn't be any problem to say that god has a body you know that shouldn't well i just don't see that god has a body well you know what are you looking at see if there was a theophany body back there before the world ever begun you know anything then that's more real than we are that's more powerful than we are that's the part that the power is in is the revealed word of understanding where we're at in things and that's what we've tried to to uh show you and to make manifest the point to where that we are the bride of jesus christ we're the last in morphe to the gentile dispensation we're the life's form that god is to take in this dispensation to the gentiles then he'll turn to the jews and then more for himself to them and that's wonderful because we can we can have a part of thinking about that hey if we are part of god and we believe that we are and if god is not complete without us well then when he goes to israel he's going to have to explain the bride he won't have to that will be his joy as to explain it and to me then what i like about it i don't think those jews when they get the message of what has happened and how they've turned down god and all like that and what took place you know and uh they weep they separate and go on set they don't get mad and hateful and well we were look we we're the bride no they forfeited their rights of being that we are the bride of christ we didn't uh make ourselves that he chose that to be that away and and you know in that form of walking in it but just remember now god has always had a body whether you would want to call it a theophany or anything like that remember it's more real than we are all right but then to remember one thing as i was trying to say now in this dispensation we are the body of jesus christ all right and that's being that body then you know that's wonderful to be in the day and the hour so let's just start reading a few of the things if i can to try to get through these notes but i wish you would if i'm i'm serious i've always tried to preach the godhead and believing it of one true and living god and seeing it coming all the way down going all the way through the dispensations and then winding up even after we are here and we leave in the rapture he's still going to be revealing himself to the jews and getting all that said and even when we get into eternity i think in the millennium he'll be there and we'll he can be talking to us and bring but even after that on into eternities all the way through then he'll still be revealing himself but the thing of it is he'll be revealing himself to people that can understand because they'll be part of him that's what i like about it i like to to think about what it's done you don't never sit down i do sometimes because like i said i've been 50 years preaching this message in a 40-something and i just sat down sometimes and just think what a wonderful opportunity i have had you don't think like that about that that you could pick up the bible and understand what you once was so mixed up in until you could not comprehend what was being said or anything but now you can just sit down and just think about him and how he's revealed himself to you and i this that's a wonderful wonderful opportunity to be able to come to that place all right but let's get into the thought now and try to understand so go ahead with number one and let's pick up a couple of scriptures that we used last sunday and let's pick those scriptures up and then we'll go into the quotes of the prophet but i wished as i'm getting the point to there i wish you would take all of these quotes i've made an opportunity last week we made some extra copies if you don't have a copy let me know especially of this today even if it takes another message because it'll be on the bride being the fullness of the godhead bodily well see then you'll see that it's not what i've tried to say or some idea that i have or a thought is what the prophet said all right then what he said is the finality and we have no rights and he couldn't uh i was thinking about what i tried to put in on the message there last sunday that you know he couldn't do it no other way forget that of well this could happen and we could have done this and we could forget all of that and remember one thing it couldn't happen no other way right because he knew it now he knew you'd be sitting here today right well you know what there's no way in the world you could get by without being here i don't care how many car wrecks you had and shotguns poked down your throats or what is going on you're going to be here because he said you would well we ought to start thinking like that on a positive note yes amen of the hour that's it here's you know for weeks and weeks i've been driving that hard to see get us to see something positive about what's taking place that we're a part of this is the bible being made manifest in this day among us by the things that are taking place around the world and all that and what about us having the understanding of that that don't thrill you that's that's something what is that thing you say aaron that your spoons fell out of your bowl or something i can't keep up with all of that but listen let's just read the scriptures and get into the thought now because we're going to be dealing we've got to review a little then we'll start dealing with the bride of jesus christ being the fullness of the godhead bodily okay now listen and he is before all things colossians 1 17-19 and by him all things consist and he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence now what is preeminence first place is that a good definition of preeminence i mean you got other definition but it really this means first place god has always wanted preeminence in his church because he wants to be number one and he ain't gonna take number two or number three so don't think well i'll give him this much of it no it's gonna be the preeminence because that's what he said the prophet said the preeminence see if you want to know what's going to take us out of here in a change of the body and a rapture and of things it's preeminence it's yielding to him first place in our lives and letting him take over all right so now listen and he's the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now all fullness is to dwell now i've spent time trying to explain that and i'll spend just a little minute on it we're going to be reading a lot of things the prophet said all god was he poured into christ all christ into the church to take her back to the garden of eden all right but i've also tried to explain that maybe wrong to try to explain god's word but the best i can do i i like i kind of like it that way i like for you to explain what you're talking about to me because that's you know that don't leave me that leaves me to understand and remember our points we've always tried to make about that little thought there that all god was he poured into christ all christ into the church take her back all right in your mind do you think of all god was he poured into christ and that just does away with god you see if you hold that thought it sounds real good it sounds like well hey yeah all god was he poured into christ no i just said it there a moment ago when we get on the other side into the eternities the prophet said god would be bringing us his message of cheer down to the endless ages so when you're saying oh god was poured into christ does that do away with god just he's gone well now there's christ he said well he's christ we got it right we got the god head right well what about when all christ was he pours into the church now he's christ's gone i mean you're gonna annihilate it's gonna do away with it or you're gonna wind up with nothing but yourself and see you don't realize now listen i hate to make this statement but it's true you don't realize that satan's plan satan's plan is to try to get me and you to believe that we are god because that would make him bring it into his being the wrong way satan's got that plan that's what he's wanting to do and see if we think that we are something then we're nothing that's the best way to say it and just get on that but you know that i've been explaining that down through time all the time trying to on the godhead to not do away with this move it over into another form it enhances or magnifies as it moves over from all god into christ then from all christ into the church it just keeps manifesting or manif um you know bringing more into the reality and then to bring it all into the church all right and see then when i read these things don't try to get anything well i don't know uh all god was important to christ all christ in the church talking about well i guess we ain't got nothing left because that's what you're saying if you don't hold that point correct that's what you're saying you're making yourself greater than he is and that's satan's plan because that's what he wants he wants to be number one but he can't do it all right go ahead to the next one number two now just for colossians all right colossians 2 10 9-10 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and look what it says and ye are complete in him so now if he's not complete without us we're part of him he's in us it's in us right which is the head of all principalities and power all right in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily then there's not a god over here and a god over here and the three gods and the situation no it's coming into reality okay reality of what it's supposed to be brother branham in the philadelphian church they don't have to pull if they can if they want to some of these i'll just read them or cover it brother branham in the philippine church age said jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of god but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of god by the holy ghost within us so he's not here now physically we meet him in the air all right so he's not here now that's the words of the problem we meet him in the air he doesn't come here physically but now here's the statements of the problem he is to come so visible among us until he would raise the dead and we'd go in the rapture now that's a direct quote he's going to be that way but not physically not in the 16th element but he's here in a greater way than the 16 elements because he's hearing you and me all right and see being that then what is that going to make me and you all right see then he made a temple he had the temple he had the things but then he came into the temple that he wanted to come into which was the body of jesus christ bringing him to the fullness of the godhead bodily bringing him to the situation to where that all power reading a minute was given unto him all right then if all of that comes into the bride who's the bride that's the simple point that i'm asking you go ahead let's read a few of these yeah because we had that about the temple let me get this part down god manifested himself there at sodom as a prophet being a man in flesh god elohim as i heard someone speak it a while ago which the godhead bodily was in him he was the fullness elohim is the fullness of the godhead bodily all right now elohim is the amorphy god right god who come down and he'll morph it himself with his people then he finally comes in his people all right and see then it brings the fullness of the godhead bodily into jesus christ but that's not all the story look at number five we'll pick these up and he didn't overcome she'll sit with me in my throne as i have overcome and set down on my father's throne in other words i took within my body the holy spirit i overcame all the things of the world through temptations and by the holy spirit and in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily all powers in heaven and in earth is given unto my hands he said all the power then god is powerless what's your prophet that way he can talk in other words what is he trying to explain that there's not a god over here and a god here and a god here called a trinity he's trying to express it to the fact of one true and living god or the correct idea of the oneness all right so look what he's saying he said all power then god is powerless if he's another person that's what i like he's powerless if he's another person so if there's three gods in your godhead trinity idea then who created who who started what and who's the most powerful jesus said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me so then he's he's powerless for the bible said jesus said after his resurrection that all power in heaven and earth both was given to his hands okay jump to number 5a all right questions and answers on hebrews and this makes the professors get great but it's simple now i'll read matthew 28 19 and you follow me and some of you with acts 2 38 have it ready i'll begin with it you know reading jesus came all right come on down to what he's doing speak unto his disciples senator all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth where's the father's power if all the power in heaven and earth is given to jesus god got powerless then didn't he or did he just tell a story was he joking he meant it because you believe it he meant it well all power is given unto me where's god's power at then he was god that's the exact that's the only thing there is to it see he is the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in jesus christ all right why because he's almighty god he's not a second person or an idea if he did you'd have two or three and one of them would be powerless this would be powerless who created who who took care of what you know you understand he said well i just can't understand the godhead i can't because you know there's one over here and one over here no think of how that god can condescend into another form he could condescend from father jehovah the old testament into the body of jesus christ and that doesn't do away with him he moves over into that form all right well can you understand it like that then jesus was god manifested in another form is that simple god was manifested in another form in other words one day i got married that made me a husband then here comes white on the scene that made me a father but did it change me did it make me any different no i'm the same person so it's it's not just it's god just moving over in another form and manifesting himself for the way that he needs to do all right let's see did we read this one go ahead go ahead number six let's just get started on the thought if you don't believe it by reading what the prophet said then it don't do anything good for me to read it to you and holler and scream at you i just go on down the road and try to help you to understand i've always tried to preach one true and living god to see him as the prophet taught it that way i don't have to you come to me in other words let me say it this way you come to me and show me where i missed the teaching of the godhead i'm inviting you come and show me where i've missed the teaching of the prophet i'm inviting you to come let's sit down and talk about it it may be just misunderstandings because that can take place it may be just some thought that we have but come and let's talk about it all right lord show me where i've missed the message that's all i've asked well you don't believe in this you don't now wait a minute let's don't get down into whether he's coming on a white horse or a red horse or a green horse or what kind of horse we don't have to get into the silliness of it we get into the basis of knowing he's coming but are you following me now oh god we'll go through these and read it and now all god was he's in morphe's changes his form steps over into another form and manifesting himself as the son of god then one day that same god comes forth and manifests himself by morphing into a church on the day of pentecost now what is let's see what is the new birth the prophet said it's father son and holy ghost coming and living in you the truth father son and holy ghost coming and living in you so are you right now by the new birth how the father son and the holy ghost dwelling inside of you in the form we would call it the holy spirit that's fine but just remember it is the fullness of god but on the product if we don't get it in a fullness we just get it in a part but he's the fullness but in the entire bride he's the fullness we'll read those things in a minute but i'm just trying to ask you a question it takes father son and holy ghost to make one god all right then don't do away with the father and move over and have a son manifest and then do away with that and have a bride no go into that form and just think about it on the day of pentecost god came back your prophet says in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost which was jehovah god coming and living in you see if you have the new birth right now you have father son and holy ghost dwelling in you that's very close to being the fullness of the godhead in one person but it won't be now we can't do it with that now we've got to keep that right it won't be in one person why because he gives it to us as a spoonful but remember the spoonful out of the ocean is the same water of the full ocean in other words it's god you have the new birth you have the father son and holy ghost dwelling in you no brother dale always thought it was just the holy ghost that we have see the holy ghost is the father it's just another form so listen to what i'm trying to say then and watch it through the series in the message all god was he just amorphies changes his form to make known himself as the son of god all right see then he just makes himself known as the bride it doesn't do away with god come on where's the body of jesus now i emphasize that a lot right that god come and came down and lived in a body but you know what he took that body up and left it and what do i emphasize you can't have two bodies god doesn't have two bodies on this earth at the same time so if he's got a body and he's dwelling in his bride there's enough it doesn't make two gods out of it doesn't make a father out of it and and a bride out of it you become god made manifest why can't we get it that way why can't we see it in a way but brother dale you mean to say that we're god made manifest will you tell me what you are you're a child of god a child of god is god made manifest in another form right so let's just read a few things now we've we've tried to keep it a little bit on the line of of uh i deliberately moved quotes around to where that my emphasis up till now has been dwelling with what that in god dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily that should be sensible no problems no thoughts no ideas that are contrary he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all right now let's go into the bride let's go into the next okay let's see what have we got good shepherd of the chief oh that's where we okay yeah what pentecost needs is a good bible lesson good teaching then you wouldn't need to much going on wouldn't need so much going on jesus christ was the son of god he had the spirit without measure we believed that in him never dwelt just a part of god but all of god was in his son jesus christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all of god was poured out in christ all that god was was in christ on all that christ is he poured out on the church but you keep refusing it look what your prophet put right in but you keep refusing it in other words you refuse to understand it you're still hung up in mind like i said i've heard ministers you have to they're trying to explain the godhead and the thing they say all god was all god was now all means all well you just done away with god why not think about it like this all that god was going to make manifest on earth was in jesus christ all that god was going to make manifest then would put jesus christ into the bride it's not all the basis of getting rid of everything it's all of what he's going to do because come on now you shook your head if nothing else you didn't amen that's not right with me but when you shake that head brother donny reagan says that that means yeah right right so you shook your head while ago about some things so just remember where you're shaking your head out all right see all god was he just stepped over into another form called jesus then all jesus was through the manifestations of the amorphies and the things that he's doing steps over into a church all right so if now if if it's true that in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily if it's true that jesus could say all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth and your prophet said then where's the power of the father he's trying to explain it right god changing him his form from one form to another all right you see that way you can understand the godhead because look what he said and him never dwelt just a part of god but all of god was in his son christ jesus he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all of god was poured out in christ all that god was was in christ and all that christ is he poured out on the church but you keep refusing you refuse to understand see the things that if i do not the works of my father believe me not how did his father send him the father sent him what went with him and in him so he just stepped from one form to another he didn't do the way with that when we get to glory i i do not and i've always taught it and believe it as well i don't believe we're going to have a part here a little part to represent the father and little part to represent the son and learn to represent the holy ghost i don't believe that now i've always taught it i don't believe that so don't ever accuse me of that even though you think that's the way i'm going with it just remember one thing jesus said i and my father are one and it's i in you and you and me all right we're going to have we're going back to that body we can understand more we're going to have according to the bible a body like unto his glorious body but see all of the fullness but just keep that in mind now i keep inside i know how the human mind runs at least mine does so you forgive me to try to explain your me to you i guess but just remember all god was important to christ doesn't do away with god it manifests god it magnifies god on the day of pentecost you had here before his crucifixion one man that had the fullness of the godhead bodily but then on the day of pentecost that god came into first 120 and then 3 000 and it's been thousands and thousands and millions coming since then of that god that's right but you see we say tonight well i'd like to have been there in the upper room what about your upper room experience what about your salvation you don't believe that that lick of fire came down on you well i've heard people explain this and explain it it didn't happen to me well what do you want some form out of it that will run into like they did with it and made tongs as the evidence or something or pillars of fires is the evidences or is this that or the other i'm talking about the coming forth into you and i as a person of the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth is the person of jesus christ coming and living in you right if not what is it well if i got a person in here think you let your mind just run into channels just listen sometime sit down and read the prophet's message i get through this series one of these things i i'm gonna try to bring out something that i've been thinking on and how everything can be natural and come down but then it turned out to be supernatural and we'll get to it but i'm trying my best to express this to us so go ahead to number seven christ is a mystery of god reveal i want to coax just a little bit so that even people listening to the tape will get the idea all right coming on down what i'm this is what i'm coming to god expressed in jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily that's what he was he was father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily but now listen you shook your head uh-huh do you believe when we get over on that other side that he's going to bring us a message of cheer or do you think you don't got all of it here uh-uh i don't i think we just getting enough here to be able to understand when we get over there all right that's the way i believe it i believe we're just getting enough to be able to understand and watch the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence the first place in his church well brother dale i just i just don't see that in the people of this message well where are you going that's all i want to know if you know it's somewhere else tell me let's go i'm not joking if you know of another church where they're bringing it out the truth and god is coming and manifesting and showing it then let's go [Music] we better be concerned about it well i think brother son well let's check out what his doctrine is check out their ways and their actions and let's see see the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence now watch fullness listen keep the word fullness in your mind now and listen all that god was the fullness now that god had bodily all that god was he poured into christ so what went into christ the fullness of the godhead okay all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was was poured into the church the believers not your denomination the believers the true born again believers so all god was coming forth and manifesting himself in a manifestation for us to understand was eventually poured into jesus christ and then it was poured into his church and when it's finished i can't help it i can't help it that we can't look and see god in people see we're looking to sue to soon we're looking to try to find some form of of a position to put it or whatever just remember whatever you're looking for then why are you not the first one manifesting that that you're looking for if we need to do this let's do it if that's what we need let's do it yeah but brother dale i'm just and i know but he poured it into the church all right go ahead the believers go ahead to the next one number eight but when the great ransom body through all ages comes up then that's going to be a great throne there revelation 7 expresses it great number which no man could number so all of the ages has come up them that's walked in the light of the bible as far as it was revealed to them and now we know that wesley had more light than luther did we know that pentecost outshined wesley certainly it does because it's just gradually let loose as it did down through the prophets and so forth until it was perfectly made known the godhead bodily in christ was finally made known it took the prophet to bring it right no problem but look and now the christ in the churches just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband notice and god is the husband of the church and the church is his bride back on it all right jump to number nine now we're going because we used that one a while ago now to you that's got your bibles turn to chapter one of revelation and start from the ninth verse your pencils and papers and i'll try to give you a little dates and so forth as we go along now this is actually this morning was more of the sermon type placing the foundation upon the deity of the revelation god being revealed in christ how many believes it god was revealed in christ jehovah revealed in christ now where's god to be revealed amen he only got from christ to the church you you don't have no second 13 14 15 persons in between right listen how many believes it god was revealed in christ jehovah revealed in christ now where's where's god to be revealed in his church with his people in us the same spirit the same works the same manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering gentleness patience peace mercy all that was in crisis in the church remember keep this in your mind all that god was he poured into christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so what was poured into christ the fullness of the godhead bodily now what and all that christ was he poured into the church what's in the church the fullness of the godhead bodily are you reading god above us god with us god in us that triunity not trinity triunity of god god manifested in three different manners father son and holy spirit what is it but do we believe it or are we still turning it down are we still refusing it as we read there while ago i mean there's one thing for sure you're gonna have to admit one thing i do make you think some people told me one time so you make us think well that's what i want us to do i want us to think because we're blinded for the point until we we do start getting it in the right order and the only way you'll get it in the right order is think about all it go ahead number 10 because then this is taken before we would see jesus we would see jesus then he god was in one man christ jesus and him brought the fullness of the godhead bodily in that one man and when that pillar of fire come down at pentecost you notice tongues of fire set upon each of them because they begin to speak in tongues before they begin to speak in tongues there was tongues of fire that was god separating himself from the pillar of fire into each member of his church god separated himself so he could be universally all over everywhere at one time universally universal means all the way around all over all you mean tell me brother dale do you believe that there's going to be a day happen that he'll be universally around the world in the broader crowd i do i've always believed it i've always believed that quote because that hangs in my mind where he said that god will pour into us his fullness see church this is 1969 because that's where i started preaching this in athens georgia oh you already seen it then because when i begin to say that the bride is the son of man well i could just i didn't have to read i could read live no the prophet's the son of man i said it's not the prophet the prophet is not the son of man i had to spend the whole service explaining that brother branham was not god i admit and say it and plan and don't worry about it he was closest thing to it than we've ever seen some of you saw him in real life you saw god living in a man but still you he told you don't get it confused come on he says right now healing meetings is going is going in africa the limes are walking the blinds are seeing all around the world the universal church of the lord jesus christ and individuals men who's living and serving him god separated himself and placed himself out among that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me i knew you and me see i will be a little while in the world because most no cosmos there the world order will see me no more yet the church shall see me for i as a personal pronoun i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's right i i will be with you seeing see the universal church of the lord jesus christ i'll be with you the works that i do so you do also listen church i don't say things to hurt people's feelings i know i do i'm sorry but i don't say it to hurt your feelings i say it to try to get you and me to the one place if we believe what the prophet says oh yeah i believe every word he says but i just write this problem over here i got his problem yeah that's what i mean but see do we believe what the prophet has said well i believe everything he said do you understand what he's saying well i don't really know for sure where i fully understand it or not well that's that's human we're human i'm not throwing off on nobody but i thought that we believe that they would be eventually to a place that we would be changed and taken out of this mess that we're in well who's going to do it well i don't know well who's going to do it go ahead number 11. we'll just keep reading a little bit do we now this is as we would see so there was sirs we would see look at moses how he was hid in the bull rush like christ so forth took it to egypt and oh just everything a lawgiver and whatever more he just betrayed christ then when christ come in him was the fullness of the spirit see that was the fullness of the godhead bodily was in christ they had it by measure now we know that same thing here tonight by the holy ghost on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire broke into many tongues of fire four tongues and said god was separating himself among the people that day god was in one person christ now he's in the entire church universal amen he's in the entire church all right go ahead 12. lean out to your own understanding you've heard this one over and over so what did it say so if you were in the foreknowledge of god then are becoming a part of god and the only way you can be a son of god or a daughter of god you had to be a part of god and god isn't complete without you has to be that's right because there is on one only one resource of eternal life and that is god and him alone has eternal life now and you were part of him and so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking okay now we'll get back to those things these brothers are covering wonderful things on these and we just thank god for all of it but see we're going to get there but think about it go ahead number 13. cross is the mystery of god reveal and in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness in his godhead deity through his church if you drop that off what are you in the fullness of his godhead amen jesus was the fullness of the godhead but what does he say deity through his church oh do you think you're god no i know i am what are you and if you don't think i am god you're off the word oh wait a minute now because i think you're god i think you're god in human flesh if you got the new birth if you got the new birth you're god in human flesh i believe that don't have no worries about it how the freedom and that's in his church oh my the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we see it what did brother brown say he's problem was one little bitty scripture right what was it somebody tell me hebrews 13 8. she was messed up in whether he was god or not she was messed up and whether or not there was a god-head dwelling in him and she was really messed up and wondered what was in her i guess come on i like the way wade was bringing out the other night i stayed with that always how adam and eve had eternal life in their soul you don't hear that priest in the people of this message they ain't going to do it i mean if i'm if i'm off the word you go get me one brain let me hear it go get me a tape of somebody in the message that explains that that adam and eve had eternal life in their soul well who do you think you are i hear one thing about it i don't care what you think i am god has brought forth his word what are we going to do i ain't challenging nobody or prone to nobody nothing i'm just telling it like it is you think you're some kind of smart ad i ain't smart i may be an elite i certainly ain't smart if i smart i'd quit and go home and let you have this thing if i smart i do that because i do away with all the heart acts and headaches that comes with doing it but don't you worry about it we're here and we're gonna make it out here see how that hybrid condition he told eve don't you do this and don't you do that eve was confused on one thing brother ryan said hebrews 13 8. he says that a quote when do you want it i'll be glad to get it after the service some of these can run it up now they can run it up and throw it over because you know it's true i wouldn't say that if the prophet hadn't said it because i'd be stupid i'd be trying to be something myself and i'm not i know that okay what do we get to we don't number what 13. did we get that 14 all right god's provided place of worship there is so many infallible proofs that jesus is the place he is the gate he's the name and the only provided way that god has for man to meet in worship he is the way he's the truth he's the life the gate the door the alpha the mega the beginning and the ending rosa shearer and lily of the valley bright and morning star all of that he is both rooting offspring of david the bright and the morning star and who is he in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily now look at little strange wordings where we in there are sons and daughters to god god in god's godhead so we're in the godhead and if that quote right back before then is right then the prophet said he's not complete without us the godhead is not complete without you brother ray yeah well i just put brother right too high huh it's the prophet telling you the truth we need to believe it okay let's go ahead what we got 15 so as we would see jesus and there was one to the called out elected church that was showing the sign that the god was in flesh jesus was god in flesh and if jesus is in you tonight it's still god manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church come on the human flesh making himself known hey come on in his church now see then brother branham was not the son of man but here's what's hard for you to follow the entire body of jesus christ all born again believers to make it the fullness of the godhead bodily is the son of man and brother branham is a part of it that's right i'm sure when we get there it'd be a glorious time to hear him some more but just remember it's going to take everybody it's going to take every born-again believer to be i have never taught that no one group of people or one little people our brother dale would do it or anything like that i've never taught the son of man any other form except one thing it takes every member of the body of jesus christ to be the son of man it takes every member of the body of christ if you ain't listened as we've read to be the fullness of the godhead bodily when are we going to believe it yeah but i just i just can't see it because i see you i see too many problems that's what you're doing you're looking at too many problems but just remember hey come on hey we got the old saying right i got two eyes looking at you you got two eyes looking at me right in other words i think i'm something you're looking down at me there's somebody looking down on you okay manifested himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known now listen brother branham was not the son of man he was not the fullness of the godhead bodily the entire bride of jesus christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily i've taught that for almost 50 years now and i'm still teaching it the son of man which is the word made flesh right and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the son of man who is the son of man the lord jesus christ but look where we would be if a prophet hadn't come okay let's see if we can what do we got uh where are we on 16 okay run it on up let's pick up just watch because i want this point then we'll try to run five it has been hit since the foundation of the world and it's seven full mystery and god promised in this day at the age of this ladies in church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing god immorphy mask in the pillar of fire god in morphy in a man called jesus god and morphy in his church god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god okay jump to the next see if we can get these out 17. almighty god unveil then it was god in them days it was god and a man his son jesus christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man or no human it was god in christ god in a man the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man god in a man now it's god in men the fullness of god in the godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word he says that's what we are he says that's the point okay go ahead 18. let's see what we need on this around to run it to the bottom just where we can get this because i'm trying to get it in here and he's governed the body of the all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like adam did at the beginning like adams was rather at the beginning 19 go on he's talking about he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in sodom when a man come down in human form three of them two angels and god himself that was god the bible said it was now he come down and he manifests himself there by turning his back to the the tent the prophet done those things right so he's got the part to do he's part of the son of man as much as anybody else all right that's where i hold the whole point the tent where sarah was and told abraham what sarah was thinking in the tent congregation says yes amen okay watch jesus himself said all at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself i believe brother branham had the ministry of jesus christ because that's malachi 4 luke 17 30 or revelation 10 that's what the scripture says but it didn't make him no different he's a human being okay listen to this the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost or the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man he said the church would do it so now you're denying him if you don't believe it it's not me you're denying him okay let's get one yeah let's get this one luther's justification wesley sanctification pentecostal baptism now we come to the head the capstone grace grace the capstone cried the headstone crying what grace grace passed from death and creed into a living word at the of the living god god's only provided place for his his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that split off of something to make it alive and seated now in heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to ever promise in the word then what does that do you being a part of god's gene a part of the word other men are part of god's word seated together manifest the entire body of christ because there's no leaven among you now living is sin all right you said well there's too much sin among us well god don't see sin if he didn't have to kill us come on come on we'll get under a lot of them things but there's no leaven among us now listen down here see what's talking about brother brown brown no leaven among you just the word only seated in heavenly places in the door where he put his name christ jesus no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you so if you want to know anything about bringing the fullness and getting the son of man it's what does he say no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily couldn't do it in luther's age now listen to him remember the other night i was bringing this out couldn't do it in wesley's age couldn't do it in the pentecostal age this couldn't be brought forth what i'm talking about it's your prophet brought couldn't be brought forth back our that's what he's just saying look couldn't do it in the pentecostal but in a day when the son of man will be manifested and you sitting here a lot of you saw the manifestation or the ministry of the son of man you saw a prophet that could stop and turn his back all those things was there but that don't make him god but it's proof of the coming forth right but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of god amongst his people see this message is the only way that you and i have any hope whatsoever but we've got to believe it's talking about us simple he tells us he lays it out in order this message couldn't come forth in luther's age right it couldn't come forth in wesley's age it couldn't come forth in the pentecostal age this message couldn't do it it had to wait until the prophet came on the scene malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7. that's right but see when we take this message and receive it and believe it then the bride will be standing on earth as the son of man the fullness of the godhead bodily he said brother dale don't that thrill you to think you preached that in 69 it does for one thing it thrills me to the fact of knowing that god done it and revealed it and showed it through the prophet but it don't exalt me whatsoever it takes me down because any revelation you've got takes you up you're in bad shape that is not a revelation from god a revelation of god would automatically carry you down you'll become very humble with it you'll you'll walk in the light of it you'll glory in it you want glory in yourself when we see it okay let's see if i can get these next two and then we'll quit okay go ahead number 21. christ when he was on earth was the body of god god created his body going on down let's pick up this part all that god was was in christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that's what the scripture says now and all that god was he poured into christ he was emmanuel god with us and all that christ was he poured into the church what is it anointed ones to continue his work that his word might live constantly okay go to the last one talking about the deity veiled in human flesh hebrews 1 and also genesis 18 remember god was a man standing there eating and talking with abraham and told what sarah was going come on musicians and doing in the tent behind it and jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh now remember jesus didn't say when the son of god is being revealed in luke 17th chapter i believe it in about the 30th first somewhere along in there and when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in the church again back in the church again revealed in human beings not son of god but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days and we find what it's promised take these home and read them i didn't write the book i gave you what the prophet had to say but are we going to believe it are we going to believe who what god says we are you know that your salvation is based upon what god has said and really it's what god said about you your salvation is based upon what god has said but i don't see these great miracles and signs and wonders if one person is healed that's a great miracle if one person is saved that is a great miracle we are seeing church but you're not paying no attention to it we've got a woman in the white house that's thus saith the lord right because that's what he said would take place but do we believe it do we believe that's the sign of the end i don't look for no tribulation no the bride don't go through tribulation but there is a pre-tribulation to strike a preacher revelation can be pretty bad the only difference in a pre-tribulation and a tribulation re if you'll take it and just listen and you'll find the prophet saying it tribulation means the wrath of god is poured out that's what tribulation means tribulation for patience that we have with one another or whatever we do or or things like that are that's not the wrath of god being poured out if you think these things are horrible wait till the wrath is poured out when there's no way for you to be able to pray for your sicknesses or anything because remember if the wrath is poured out on the gentile dispensation you're already in the tribulation yes and you are lost the only thing you can do there is give your life for the gospel and hope for a salvation of a foolish virgin that can happen but who wants to try it on a foolish version why would we want to try it when we've got the word understand think on these things take these quotes and just read them and see what the prophet has said this is not what brother dale has said or anything it is not what brother branham has said it is what god has used to speak through brother branham to bring to you and i yes amen but do you believe it's possible for the bride of christ to be the fullness of the godhead bodily if you don't then you're going to have to deny every one of these quotes we just read if you believe that the son of man can be the word made flesh in the entire body of christ then there's hope for us and a change of the body if not there's no hope it's left up to us to believe it well i don't see it well what are you looking for who's got it i don't see nobody's got it but oh ain't suddenly she she's got it but she just dips a little snuff and lies a whole lot yeah you're getting aggravating now okay let's get off of that what we got let's sing that uh see i'm just trying my best to get you to see what your prophet said about you go ahead brother we find many people who can't understand why we are so happy and free i've crossed over jordan to canaan's fair land and this is [Applause] i've crossed over [Music] [Music] the devil don't believe it i see but i'm filled with the spirit there isn't a doubt that's what's the matter with me oh this is like heaven to [Music] [Music] and this is [Music] has come to ask about so you just drop down in there and just take it all away let it all be made manifest we'll see you and have lord dear the part the time to take the honor and glory as to the one who's done it for us we love you and we thank you in jesus name christ anybody else and this is like heaven don't forget we've been ministering this afternoon just keep these in mind [Music] if this is not the word of god oh this is like heaven too tell me where and let's go this is like heaven to me i ain't claiming to be the only one preaching the word i ain't never said nothing like that but there's one thing about it we've seen god open his word [Music] when we opened up the internet to where it was going to put out there for the world to be the to view the internet i thought we would be so beat to death with quotes and if that's another you know and thoughts and ideas of preachers all across the world whenever they get it i finally preached a series on the doctrines of the message that i didn't agree with and why and one brother said you don't understand well but listen church god is wanting somebody to believe his word it's not to believe brother dale is to believe the word of god and let him make it manifest that's all he's waiting on for somebody to believe it father we thank you for your loving your grace unto us we thank you for today and we just ask you now to go with the people and may they take these quotes from the prophet and know that it's not what we've said but it's what you said and we haven't denied any form whatsoever that you've manifested yourself among us in we believe in every form we believe in ever and morphy we believe in all the things that you've made manifest we love you we thank you in jesus name amen you're just oh this is like heaven to me oh this is like heaven to me
