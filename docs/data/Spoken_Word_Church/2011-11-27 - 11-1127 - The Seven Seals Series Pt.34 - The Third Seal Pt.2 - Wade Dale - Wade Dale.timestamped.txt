[1:45] with it the other day when I come back
[1:46] to work he would G me a big old
[1:49] kiss he sent me a he sent me a u um text
[1:55] message that how much he missed me so
[1:58] bless is real real man he's a good kid I
[2:01] like like to work with him I like to see
[2:03] his life change more than anything see a
[2:06] life change right buddy I'm sure Rachel
[2:09] scolded him some while you were yeah
[2:15] probably all right third seal now we got
[2:18] we're hooked up and we're on when he had
[2:22] opened the third seal I heard the third
[2:23] B say come and see and I beheld in l a
[2:26] black horse he that sat on him had a
[2:28] pair of balances in his hand
[2:30] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[2:31] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[2:33] penny and three measures of barley for a
[2:35] penny and see thou hurt not the
[2:38] oil and the wine now let's go back and
[2:41] get our symbols
[2:43] together our symbols on the third seal
[2:45] is what pair balances wheat and barley
[2:47] oil and
[2:48] wine it was a black horse which we we
[2:52] looked in the denomination on ISM and
[2:54] death now remember let's don't get this
[2:56] confused let's stay at the
[2:58] level because the second seal was red
[3:02] that was killing that was physically
[3:03] killing the people right we've moved up
[3:06] a little higher
[3:08] now cuz this is spiritual
[3:11] death remember the Blackness of Cain he
[3:14] killed Abel but he he didn't kill Abel
[3:17] to make him
[3:19] bad came became one with his Doctrine
[3:22] before and that's what caused him to
[3:24] kill Abel right all right that's what
[3:27] caused him to kill Abel so what was his
[3:30] Doctrine is what killed him and then he
[3:33] got able killed physically all right so
[3:36] we come
[3:37] through the White Horse which he had to
[3:41] start with the White Horse couldn't
[3:42] start with the red had to start with the
[3:43] white cuz everything had to be righteous
[3:45] right good upstanding
[3:49] people right little saying little deed
[3:52] little little foxes that's full ofine
[3:54] all right so then Satan moved up in the
[3:57] second seal to a what a red horse where
[4:00] he physically killed the people and and
[4:03] uh June's going to look up uh and
[4:06] I you know you can read Fox's book of
[4:08] Martyrs if you want to I started reading
[4:10] it but it was it's kind of rough to read
[4:14] but Google Dark Ages that second seal
[4:17] covered the Dark Ages in Columbus time
[4:19] all right and um there's some good
[4:21] commentary on what happened during the
[4:23] Dark Ages all right we know
[4:26] that the Catholic Church physically
[4:28] killed 60 8 million Protestants because
[4:32] of their Doctrine killed them physically
[4:36] right all right but see Satan wasn't
[4:38] finished there you know what Satan did
[4:41] Satan did God a favor in the people
[4:45] too he put the Christians in the sixth
[4:47] Dimension where they're
[4:50] Eternal so Satan's like well I got to do
[4:52] something else that's what the devil
[4:54] thinks cuz he sure does play with my
[4:57] mind enough to make me think that way
[4:59] right
[5:00] yeah we're all those that are immune
[5:02] come come in and teach this Ser
[5:04] teach all right but uh we are looking
[5:09] now at something that Satan done he's
[5:11] not physically killing the people
[5:13] now he's killing them spiritually that's
[5:16] right
[5:18] black denominational
[5:23] death brother randam said in in the I
[5:26] was reading the third seal he said he
[5:28] said and he would get on over even into
[5:30] the seventh seal and he said now I know
[5:33] why I was so against those denominations
[5:35] not the people right but now let me add
[5:38] something to that you say well the
[5:40] people are good people they are but if
[5:42] they take on that Doctrine they're just
[5:44] as dead as that denomination is sorry
[5:48] that's right I didn't say that God said
[5:50] it God said it's my way or no other way
[5:53] that's right sorry that's what he said
[5:56] so they may be good people and they may
[5:57] be given eternal life
[6:00] but they got to go to the white Throne
[6:01] judgment and be judged for what they do
[6:04] and what they know right all right but
[6:07] now you and I don't have that excuse all
[6:09] right we're we're either do or die here
[6:12] all right when he had opened the third
[6:14] seal I heard the third Beast say come
[6:15] and see and I beheld a little black
[6:17] horse and he that s on him had a pair of
[6:19] balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice
[6:21] in the midst of the four beast that's
[6:23] what I want to get to Heard a Voice this
[6:25] is the first time you hear another voice
[6:28] other than
[6:30] the four
[6:31] Beast
[6:33] remember and I Heard a Voice in the
[6:35] midst of the four
[6:37] Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny
[6:40] three measures of barley for a penny and
[6:42] see thou hurt not the oil and the
[6:45] wine seal those people up with the Holy
[6:48] Ghost cuz see we went through
[6:49] justification right we went through
[6:52] sanctification in the red
[6:54] horse right the blood and now we've come
[6:57] to it you say well what is black got to
[6:59] do with having the Holy
[7:01] Ghost if you're not dead today if the
[7:04] old you is not dead you don't have the
[7:05] Holy
[7:07] Ghost and what's death
[7:10] black brother you got to be zeroed out
[7:13] blacked out whatever you want to say
[7:16] you I see the physical you sitting here
[7:20] you're not physically dying I mean yeah
[7:22] we're physically dying but we're not
[7:23] physically Dead all right but
[7:27] inside it's where the dying is the worst
[7:31] brother BR said 68 million cathol I mean
[7:33] 68 million Protestants were killed
[7:35] during the Reformation or not the
[7:37] Reformation but the um uh Dark
[7:40] Ages he said Untold billions by their
[7:43] Doctrine so see we've come to where
[7:45] we've talked about and this is the point
[7:47] I want you to see we've talked about
[7:49] what justification talked about
[7:51] sanctification now we're talking about
[7:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a type
[7:55] because the wicked one brings you
[7:57] denominational ideas even the church age
[8:00] was the fifth and sixth age which is
[8:01] Luther and Wesley and that combat Beast
[8:03] was man but this right here was so
[8:06] important this third seal was so
[8:08] important that the prophet said the lamb
[8:10] spoke
[8:11] himself read your seal book y'all need
[8:13] to read the third seal over and over
[8:16] again it was the lamb that spoke CU it
[8:18] said in the midst of the four
[8:21] Beast what the lamb is
[8:24] protecting the lamb comes on the scene
[8:26] at the Holy Ghost and only at the Holy
[8:27] Ghost does he come on the scene right MH
[8:30] all right we know he's on the scene of
[8:31] justification in a partial form
[8:32] sanctification in a partial form but
[8:34] it's the lamb himself it was the Lamb of
[8:37] God he gave his life for who me and you
[8:39] so when we're born again we receive that
[8:41] lamb that sacrifice he we have to look
[8:43] to him correct right we can't sacrifice
[8:47] ourselves I'm going to read you
[8:48] something in the seal book it's going to
[8:49] help
[8:50] you let's don't let read it in just a
[8:52] minute but there's where that we see the
[8:54] third seal he was so protective of those
[8:58] people he said see thou not hurt the oil
[9:02] and the
[9:04] wine now what's brother brand said wine
[9:08] was stimulation and oil was the Holy
[9:10] Ghost oil types the Holy Ghost wine
[9:14] types of stimulation of Revelation that
[9:16] you get when you have the Holy Ghost
[9:18] wheat and barley or what sustaining life
[9:21] bread all right and then the pair of
[9:24] balances was the one Satan had in his
[9:26] hand right he had a pair of balance
[9:30] bances and he said he that sat on him
[9:32] had a pair of
[9:33] balances in his hand so Satan's the only
[9:35] thing that have this in his hand he
[9:36] didn't have this Satan can't touch that
[9:38] wheat and barley he can't touch the true
[9:40] word of God he can't touch the oil and
[9:43] the wine or we can imitate it cuz we saw
[9:45] him imitate in the first stage right but
[9:47] he's come to a higher form now to where
[9:49] man he's got a pair of balances in his
[9:52] hand because look that's what it says
[9:54] here when he had open third seal go down
[9:57] to the Black Horse and he that sat on
[9:59] him him had a pair of balances in his
[10:01] hand period And I Heard a Voice in the
[10:04] midst of the four Beast say a measure of
[10:06] wheat for a penny and three measures of
[10:08] barley for a penny see thou hurt not the
[10:11] oil and the
[10:14] wine all right so that was what the lamb
[10:16] said the lamb spoke and said
[10:20] hey in other words listen to this the
[10:23] person on that horse has no power the
[10:27] person on that horse has no way to
[10:30] sustain your life he can't give you
[10:33] bread he can't give you all in one Jesus
[10:37] is saying in the in the lamb form the
[10:39] Lord is
[10:41] saying protect see thou not
[10:44] hurt this group of people cuz he knew
[10:47] that see Satan had become more and more
[10:49] shrew because look the combat Beast with
[10:51] a man what is
[10:53] that intelligence so Satan came from
[10:56] physically killing somebody where I can
[10:58] look and see that that sister Gwen's
[11:00] being persecuted and the Catholic Church
[11:02] kills her and she's out of the way her
[11:04] Soul's locked away but see we can see
[11:06] that
[11:07] physically but to sit somewhere and and
[11:10] die
[11:12] spiritually remember the Bible says a
[11:14] woman is dead while she's living talking
[11:17] about the church talking about the
[11:19] church but still talking about you and I
[11:21] individuals cuz the Baptist Methodist
[11:23] Pentecostal they're dead they're dead
[11:26] while they're living we see them Al and
[11:28] go church and they build big churches
[11:30] and all that but they're dead full of
[11:32] Dead Man's Bones the Bible said all
[11:34] right but here the lamb has come on the
[11:36] scene in this third
[11:39] seal why that's the Holy Ghost Christ
[11:43] the lamb the Holy Ghost brother Brown
[11:44] said was the what same
[11:46] person so there was the lamb speaking
[11:49] out a measure of a measure of barley a
[11:52] measure of wheat for a
[11:54] penny but don't you hurt the oil in wine
[11:57] all right so at third seal he brings in
[12:00] he brings in an idea that I want you to
[12:03] think about God comes on the scene at
[12:05] the new birth right that's God
[12:08] himself coming to take up a boat in you
[12:11] but if you're still
[12:13] alive spiritually the old person the one
[12:16] that your mom and daddy gave you the old
[12:18] natur if it's still alive all you done
[12:21] was divorce the
[12:22] thing and you can't marry sisters you
[12:26] can't marry until your husband is what
[12:29] dead
[12:30] dead brothers and sisters we can't marry
[12:34] Christ until our husband is
[12:38] dead they can't they can't hear
[12:42] you
[12:44] death so the old you is dead God don't
[12:48] reside you can't put him in a closet and
[12:50] pull him out when you need him that's
[12:52] right cuz the old man is definitely he's
[12:53] going to come out of that closet by
[12:55] himself you're not going to have to go
[12:56] get it that's right right right I was
[12:58] wondering whether the wheat and barley
[13:00] had anything to do with at the end time
[13:02] here now the same uh you won't be able
[13:06] to buy or sell unless you take that Mark
[13:09] right well it says this does say a
[13:11] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[13:13] measures of barley for a penny the only
[13:14] thing brother brandham said was that was
[13:16] the sustaining life that Satan see Satan
[13:20] now is trying to take that life away
[13:21] from us right we know Jesus is a bread
[13:25] of life and we're we're not you know
[13:27] we're not denying that but you and
[13:30] I if he transfers all that he was to us
[13:34] then what are
[13:38] we we're the bread of
[13:41] life right somebody cannot get the Holy
[13:44] Ghost you look at me kind of
[13:46] awkward I thought we were Christ made
[13:48] manifest in another
[13:50] form where does life come from the body
[13:54] of
[13:57] Christ like from the
[13:59] body right which is the wheat and the
[14:02] bread The Barley right if Jesus said I
[14:05] am the
[14:06] bread and he comes inside of me and I
[14:10] speak his word and you get a revelation
[14:14] you didn't get it from me you got it
[14:16] from God but like daddy's been preaching
[14:18] you listen to what he's saying the words
[14:21] of a
[14:22] man not nothing to do with us as far as
[14:25] flesh we're just servants we just stand
[14:28] here suppos to be empty but God's going
[14:31] to speak to you through somebody that's
[14:33] right I don't care if it's another
[14:34] sister or a
[14:36] brother but see God's not going to give
[14:38] you the Holy Ghost by him just speaking
[14:40] it directly to
[14:41] you that's not the way it happens right
[14:44] right that's right you had to hear the
[14:46] what word and did you hear it from
[14:50] somebody either Grandma Grandpa Mama
[14:53] daddy brother sister you heard the word
[14:55] whether you wanted to hear it or not
[14:57] physically you heard the
[14:59] word right brother Tim you heard it from
[15:02] somebody that's right you know all that
[15:05] times Mama used to tell me you know this
[15:07] and that and the other that was God
[15:08] speaking to me but I what I do I didn't
[15:11] listen so see I can reverse this thing
[15:14] and see that this black horse done
[15:16] something he cut me off from
[15:19] God see he killed a lot of
[15:22] people with
[15:24] Doctrine more than he killed him with
[15:27] physical
[15:29] sword or tear him apart or beheading or
[15:32] all that he done those people a
[15:34] favor see we got to look at this thing
[15:36] like Brother Don you know I went in
[15:38] there last night and and sister Jun and
[15:40] I went in and had a chance to just kind
[15:42] of stand there and talk to him for a few
[15:44] minutes and of course he they said he
[15:46] could he could hear and uh and I said
[15:49] Brother Don I said I'll see you in the
[15:52] morning true he just going to be as
[15:54] sleep one night that's right and I was
[15:57] telling June have you ever read your
[15:58] jensson
[15:59] book you see where brother rown died he
[16:03] died at
[16:06] 549 Christmas Eve morning 557 557
[16:12] sorry well I looked up this morning it's
[16:14] really actually
[16:15] 549 see he's only going to be dead for a
[16:18] few
[16:19] minutes cuz he's the one that told us
[16:23] sometime between 6 and 99 in the morning
[16:26] mhm the dead in Christ is going to rise
[16:29] right so he didn't make it at 6:00 but
[16:32] he's only got just a few minutes left
[16:34] right think of it that way Brother Don
[16:37] was 83 years old God did him a
[16:39] favor by taking him home sometimes we
[16:43] wish as humans to hold on to them but
[16:45] when they get to that age that's uh you
[16:47] know we went and spoke with him a few
[16:48] weeks ago and and he said brother I just
[16:51] can't have faith for
[16:52] myself I said well we're just going to
[16:54] believe for you but his s his his
[16:57] daughter prayed that he he would go if
[16:59] he was going to go go quick yeah and
[17:02] Buddy he went quick
[17:04] yeah but I leaned down I told him I said
[17:07] Brother Don I said I see you in the
[17:08] morning I always tell people that told
[17:10] told Brother you know brother Tom that
[17:11] long time before he died that just don't
[17:14] worry about it don't
[17:15] worry sure this Blackness of death is
[17:18] something that scares all of us but when
[17:22] Jesus he must be protecting somebody
[17:25] when he speaks himself out of this third
[17:27] seal says hey yes hurt not the allil the
[17:31] wine I'm the bread they're going to get
[17:34] it from
[17:35] me but you're not going to hurt somebody
[17:37] that's got the Holy Ghost in Revelation
[17:39] right you can't hurt a
[17:41] Christian I told Brother Don I said you
[17:44] know just something they said that you
[17:45] know he could hear and he's laying there
[17:47] and I told the told Brother Don I said I
[17:50] want you to tell me that
[17:52] job about O Jones when I see you again
[17:56] and his old finger didn't his old finger
[17:57] just went to twe twitching I mean his
[18:00] finger just went to twitching like crazy
[18:01] he heard what I said cuz I can't
[18:04] remember the joke but he told it in
[18:05] brother brandham the story behind that
[18:07] Brother Don was standing at the
[18:08] Tabernacle telling a joke and brother
[18:10] Brandon was driving by with his window
[18:12] down and he heard him telling a joke and
[18:13] he said oh that's a that joke about O
[18:15] Jones so he knew the same joke that
[18:17] brother Bram knew so that's kind of the
[18:19] way I put that together but I wanted to
[18:20] relate something to him so he could
[18:23] remember he won't forget that right he's
[18:26] in he's in a dimension now where he
[18:28] won't forget that right and I told him I
[18:31] said I want you to tell me that joke
[18:33] when you see me and boy old finger just
[18:35] went to twitching like crazy you know
[18:37] he's just doing this fun just like this
[18:40] that's but he couldn't speak and he
[18:42] couldn't you know his human faculties we
[18:45] going away but as the human faculty goes
[18:48] away that's when that protection comes
[18:51] cuz a lamb is our protector right amen
[18:53] he's the one who protects us cuz he
[18:56] gives us what he gives us our bread give
[18:58] us our oil and our wine you know it to
[19:01] take away the the Earthly part of it but
[19:04] if you had wine and bread you understand
[19:06] about wine I mean if you drank a lot of
[19:07] wine you'd be drunk but people in the
[19:10] other countries that's they drink wine
[19:11] for their meals and they don't think a
[19:13] thing about it but oil wine wheat and
[19:19] Barley if you had unlimited amount of
[19:22] Wheat and barley and oil you'd never go
[19:25] hungry and you'd have wine to drink
[19:27] that's what was telling it right here in
[19:29] this seal when he saw that horse rider
[19:32] go out he said hey don't worry when
[19:34] somebody says this thing is
[19:37] black that's just my Revelation that
[19:40] God's tell trying to tell us hey I'll
[19:42] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[19:45] you thank you Lord I'm going to be with
[19:47] you right here even till death physical
[19:51] death comes that's okay I'll be right
[19:53] there with you the whole time all right
[19:56] I've always said many times that that
[19:58] you know we believe in angels brother
[20:01] Bown said the death angel come to get
[20:03] you but that death Angel's got one thing
[20:06] he's got a problem with a
[20:08] Christian I think about this the other
[20:10] day we were sitting somewhere in airport
[20:12] I guess and uh just masses of people and
[20:16] you know remember I told you one time
[20:18] that I you asked the Lord said why why
[20:20] me why me and all these 50,000 people
[20:23] that go through Atlanta airport why I
[20:25] mean he said because you chose me above
[20:30] and they never would come to a
[20:33] realization that I was their savior then
[20:36] I was sitting there I was like Lord what
[20:37] in the world but all the Death Angels do
[20:40] they just take these people and they put
[20:42] them in what The Fifth Dimension right
[20:44] they put him in the dimension of the
[20:46] Dead well we don't go in The Fifth
[20:49] Dimension we ain't dead that's a good
[20:51] old southern word we ain't dead we are
[20:54] not dead we are alive right so that when
[20:58] that Death Angel comes to get a
[21:00] Christian I don't believe he can even
[21:01] touch
[21:03] him I believe he just brother Ram said
[21:06] he'll send somebody down to the river
[21:09] right thank God for a prophet he said he
[21:13] said the Lord will send somebody down to
[21:14] the river that you
[21:17] know they send you down to the river
[21:20] them down to the river to help you
[21:21] across
[21:22] Jordan so whoever Brother Don knew could
[21:25] be brother Brandon but you know what the
[21:26] dead in Christ arise first and I was
[21:28] thinking this morning it says the first
[21:30] shall be last I mean the and the last
[21:32] shall be first we're the last Church age
[21:35] but we're going to be the first church a
[21:36] to
[21:37] resurrect so we're going to get to see
[21:39] him
[21:41] amen cuz he's under the
[21:44] protection you say oh no if you got the
[21:47] Holy Ghost you're protected right that's
[21:49] why we type justification sanctification
[21:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost justification
[21:53] first seal sanctification second seal
[21:56] and the third seal is is not So Much
[22:00] Death as as as oh this death is going to
[22:03] grip you no I want to
[22:05] die I want to die I ain't dead
[22:09] enough I want to be dead but at least
[22:12] one thing I know the the one inside of
[22:14] me that you can't see he died a long
[22:16] time
[22:17] ago you may have problems in that Spirit
[22:20] realm and in that flesh realm but that
[22:22] man
[22:23] died and I'm sealed in by what the Holy
[22:27] Spirit
[22:29] but see that's just the
[22:30] earnest cuz the seals don't stop at
[22:33] number
[22:34] three that's just the earnest I don't
[22:36] like saying just the holy spirit's not a
[22:39] just but the Bible did call it a
[22:41] thing all right black horse that doesn't
[22:46] start your
[22:47] journey I mean stop your journey that
[22:50] begins your
[22:51] journey as a
[22:54] Christian right the spirit part of you
[22:56] starts cuz the oh you does what do we do
[23:00] in baptism we bury them but we don't
[23:04] leave them
[23:05] under thank
[23:07] God we resurrect them to what newness of
[23:12] life
[23:14] life you say all this
[23:17] yeah there's life and
[23:21] death because death is going to be
[23:23] swallowed up the Bible says in what
[23:26] life death is going to be swallowed up
[23:29] in life and that's what he's telling us
[23:32] in this third seal he said hey don't
[23:34] worry he said it himself he spoke
[23:38] brother R said the lamb speaks out of
[23:40] the midst of the four
[23:41] beast and says don't you hurt this thing
[23:44] don't you hurt these people sure they
[23:47] going to physically kill them
[23:49] but when that Death Angel went in to get
[23:51] brother dawn last night 1:00 or this
[23:53] morning at 1:00 that angel had to take
[23:55] him to a different place and it wasn't
[23:58] the
[24:00] angel it wasn't the
[24:02] angel that had a
[24:05] choice he had to take him in the sixth
[24:09] Dimension that's why death is not a
[24:11] ruler over us if you're a Christian even
[24:13] in physical death that Death Angel comes
[24:16] to get you you say
[24:19] no I know where I'm going right just get
[24:22] me down to the river there'll be
[24:24] somebody will have their hand out yes
[24:26] Lord somebody will be there to help me
[24:29] across that river that dark place we
[24:31] call
[24:33] death but justification sanctification
[24:36] we've come to the man which is
[24:37] intelligent so what God what God did is
[24:40] God said protect them give them the Holy
[24:43] Ghost protect them and a type of us now
[24:45] not that age didn't get all the Holy
[24:47] Ghost don't don't don't get mixed up
[24:49] right everybody understand that we're
[24:51] typing kind of back and forth but the
[24:53] the physical death is that that black
[24:55] horse is going to ride he's riding
[24:58] through denominational
[25:00] ideas it's the man age or intelligence
[25:03] age so what did Satan do Satan said well
[25:06] I can't if I physically kill them I'm
[25:08] doing them a favor so now I'm going to
[25:10] let them live but I'm going to give them
[25:12] a different
[25:14] Doctrine which is much more deceptive
[25:16] and much more black as far as death than
[25:20] the other one which was the the
[25:24] sanctification or
[25:25] the physical killing of the people
[25:27] people the red but in this fifth and
[25:30] sixth age is when denominational ideas
[25:32] began to
[25:33] come now Luther Luther wasn't a
[25:37] denomination Luther was a born again
[25:39] Christian Luther was bride and the
[25:42] people he pulled out of that Catholic
[25:44] church or wherever from was bride right
[25:47] he was a Protestant he protested the
[25:49] Catholic Church those people came out
[25:51] and God was pleased to dwell in that man
[25:53] Luther but now when Luther
[25:55] died what did it become
[25:58] a Lutheran
[26:00] Doctrine Satan said oh Mighty Man
[26:02] remember Satan's
[26:04] follows Satan never goes ahead of God
[26:07] remember one thing for sure if Satan's
[26:09] doing something God's already done it in
[26:11] the positive form remember that Satan's
[26:15] already done it in the I mean God's
[26:17] always already done it in the positive
[26:18] form Satan's doing it in the negative
[26:20] form so as as he told him hurt not the
[26:24] only one this black horse is not going
[26:27] to hurt
[26:28] US unless we let it hurt yes Lord but if
[26:32] we're sealed in by the Holy Spirit then
[26:34] we are dead but you know what what comes
[26:37] to us at the New Birth the baptism of
[26:39] the Holy Ghost what God himself
[26:41] intelligence we take all that that was
[26:44] in here what happened to the the day of
[26:46] Pentecost the 120 in the upper room
[26:48] listen to The Very Word of Life The Very
[26:51] bread they listened to Jesus for three
[26:53] and A2 years did not have a clue what he
[26:56] was saying
[26:58] but they packed it right
[27:00] here and on the day of Pentecost God
[27:03] quickened every bit of
[27:05] that right to 120 people he quickened
[27:09] all that word that they
[27:11] held and they
[27:13] died to their self sure Peter jumps up
[27:17] and says repent and be baptized in the
[27:18] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[27:20] of these sins and you shall receive the
[27:22] gift of the Holy Ghost for this promises
[27:23] to you and you children to them and the
[27:25] far off even as many as our Lord Our God
[27:27] shall call
[27:28] so we baptize in a name the name of
[27:30] Jesus Christ which is this lamb what was
[27:32] the Lamb's
[27:33] name God only had one name if God the
[27:36] lamb and the Holy Ghost is the same
[27:37] person what's what's the Lamb's name
[27:39] Jesus
[27:41] Christ amen Behold the Lamb of God that
[27:45] takes away the sin of the world who was
[27:46] standing on Earth Jesus Christ that's
[27:49] what John said Behold the Lamb of God
[27:51] that takes away the sin of the world all
[27:52] right who's God Jesus Christ I come in
[27:56] my father's name mhm God's not a name
[27:59] father's not a name but Jesus Christ is
[28:01] a name that's what we identify all right
[28:04] and then also in number three but now
[28:07] look let's get one thing here and then
[28:08] we'll
[28:10] go the intelligence of man intelligence
[28:13] is not bad as long as you don't let it
[28:15] become a part of man's
[28:19] ideas right intelligence is not bad
[28:22] because Peter James and all them in the
[28:24] upper room if they had not
[28:26] heard right the word for 3 and 1/2 years
[28:30] spoke to them what that's what I saying
[28:31] about
[28:33] bread this is sustaining life to the
[28:35] bride it's not uh let's read something
[28:38] let's turn this seal book let's read it
[28:39] real quick I want you to see something
[28:41] right
[28:43] here
[28:45] 212 page 212 in this book third
[28:50] seal paragraph 56 and then we're going
[28:53] to read
[28:56] paragraph
[29:01] 111 all
[29:03] right paragraph
[29:06] 56 sister Johnny I I preached this in
[29:09] Wich last Sunday about the justification
[29:12] sanctification the justification the
[29:14] glorification the three steps of
[29:16] justification they really
[29:19] enjoyed really enjoyed it yeah I'm hot
[29:22] too just like paragraph 56 look just
[29:26] like take it on the other side there was
[29:27] people coming in who has heard power as
[29:29] kings but wasn't Kings see see you have
[29:32] to notice the Bible terminology of
[29:33] anything see now watch but this the
[29:36] reason that all the straying ends of the
[29:38] mysterious part about justification the
[29:41] mysterious part about sanctification the
[29:43] mysterious part of the baptism of the
[29:45] Holy Ghost and why what kind did did he
[29:48] eat an apple or did she eat a
[29:49] pomegranate or something see was what
[29:51] was the serpent seed and oh as the
[29:53] baptism in the name of the father son
[29:54] and the name of the Lord Jesus right oh
[29:56] hundreds of those things has been left
[29:58] loose ended he's talking about it not
[30:00] being a great big show but up there
[30:01] above it he says why didn't these other
[30:02] men paragraph 55 Wesley Luther and other
[30:05] great reformers who brought out
[30:07] justification sanctification and the
[30:08] Pentecostal age with the baptism of the
[30:10] Holy Ghost and things why didn't they
[30:11] catch these these messages why didn't
[30:14] they get them because they were
[30:15] reformers that's right okay now God was
[30:18] doing a work of restoration
[30:21] mhm right but they were reformers they
[30:24] reformed the people Luther said to just
[30:27] shall live by faith but still drank beer
[30:28] and smoked the pie but God reformed him
[30:31] from the Catholic Church started
[30:33] restoration because when you get two
[30:35] shoots that is the corn plant it's just
[30:39] a different kind of life I mean not a
[30:40] different kind of Life sorry a different
[30:42] manifestation same life cuz the same
[30:45] life that put up two shoots is the same
[30:47] life that's going to make that air corn
[30:48] on the end where you going to get it
[30:50] from that's what I said before through
[30:51] the foolishness of preaching or the
[30:54] words of a man you're going to get
[30:56] perfected
[30:58] sorry that's just what God said he said
[31:00] he said I give you Apostles prophets
[31:02] pastors teachers and evangelists for
[31:03] what perfecting the
[31:06] Saints in other words giving you bread
[31:09] giving you
[31:10] oil giving you wine all right now now we
[31:14] don't give you the Holy Ghost and we
[31:16] don't give you a revelation but we give
[31:18] you the
[31:19] ability to hear what God has to say in a
[31:23] form you can understand mhm you
[31:26] understand that in form you can
[31:28] understand
[31:29] am there's intelligence in a form you
[31:32] can what understand break it down to the
[31:35] people cuz see here he says Luther had
[31:38] justification Wesley sanctification in
[31:40] paragraph here but look down to part it
[31:42] says mysterious
[31:43] part mysterious part justification
[31:46] mysterious mysterious part
[31:48] sanctification see the mysterious part
[31:50] is to me and
[31:51] you because justification sanctification
[31:53] baptism the Holy Ghost puts you in the
[31:55] body but that's just the earnest
[31:58] that's not the full possession the full
[32:00] possession is you're Justified and that
[32:04] person never did it start with and
[32:05] you're standing glorified in God's sight
[32:08] now let's read one more thing let's go
[32:10] over to one what I say 11
[32:17] 11 let's just let's just let brother
[32:21] brandham blow the doors off of this
[32:25] doctrine that we've been hearing about
[32:27] Adam seed and Eve the Sab and all this
[32:30] stuff listen to this I knew it was in
[32:31] here I just had read it in a
[32:35] while let's read verse let's read 110
[32:38] the real human blood as human beings
[32:40] would be become incarnate god without
[32:42] sex virgin the Virgin birth produced
[32:44] that now God's word promises promise
[32:48] become blood and was incarnate in the
[32:49] person of Jesus Christ the Savior the BL
[32:52] bulls and goats and so forth but now
[32:54] wait here God made the promise say
[32:57] saying it would be there when it come
[33:00] her seed should bruise the Serpent's
[33:02] head now if her seed come just like from
[33:06] Adam or like it been from The Serpent
[33:09] and so forth then it still be sinful
[33:14] seed that's why I said there's nobody
[33:16] good know not one I don't care how
[33:18] righteous your parents
[33:19] are I don't care how righteous they were
[33:21] in the Old Testament they had to have a
[33:25] sacrifice and sure the father made a
[33:27] sacrifice for the daughter until she
[33:29] became a full age right until she was
[33:31] married that's the same way you know
[33:34] many times before you've heard me say it
[33:36] that
[33:37] you Joon Danny your hes Holy Ghost until
[33:41] she gets
[33:43] it I'm my daughter's Holy Ghost until
[33:46] she gets it if she lives in my
[33:47] house all right that's the truth yeah
[33:51] and you're the head yeah you're the head
[33:54] boys and girls don't matter but just for
[33:56] an example since we you know didn't Jo
[33:58] in here but for an example that's true
[34:00] you will be held accountable for what
[34:02] she does until she gets married now our
[34:05] leaves home and then you can't you know
[34:06] you can't you got to cut the
[34:08] cord but listen this if her seed came
[34:11] just like from Adam or like had been
[34:13] from The Serpent and so forth then it'd
[34:14] still be sinful seed that's the reason
[34:17] John wept there was no man because no
[34:19] man everybody was across the other side
[34:20] of the ditch the chasm but there's
[34:23] coming a time when this substitute blood
[34:24] of animal would be done away with when
[34:26] the real and carnate blood came God made
[34:29] God made Flesh and
[34:32] Blood all right so God had to come and
[34:36] what he have to do he had to die to
[34:39] release what I was just talking about
[34:41] the life not the literal blood you can
[34:44] be covered in it today you can just be
[34:46] poured with Jesus's blood and you still
[34:47] be just as rot and sinner as you can be
[34:49] yeah right but it was the life that was
[34:52] in that
[34:53] blood I got a little thought maybe that
[34:56] about
[34:57] believing that maybe I want to bring
[34:59] next Sunday I think that is going to be
[35:00] gone so
[35:03] believing do we really
[35:07] believe or is it just a mental
[35:10] attitude but brother R said the mental
[35:13] you know right mental attitude toward
[35:14] God or bring bring any promise to pass
[35:17] that's
[35:19] right but what if you're a born again
[35:21] believer and that blood is there for
[35:24] you see that's why that sanctification
[35:27] that second seal was so good showing
[35:29] that how God
[35:31] Sanctified you through what his blood
[35:34] and then now if you're Sanctified you're
[35:37] dead if you're dead your life is what
[35:41] hid in Christ I'm quoting
[35:43] scripture and Satan can't get in there
[35:46] the only way you can get in these people
[35:49] he figured out that hey I can't kill
[35:51] them physically cuz I'm just doing them
[35:52] a good deed I'm going to take and I'm
[35:55] going to take what these men say
[35:57] and I'm going to twist it just a little
[35:59] bit and I'm going to kill a whole lot
[36:01] more cuz they're going to sit in these
[36:02] big old churches and they're going to
[36:03] just die they're just going to be
[36:07] dead believeth thou this yes all right
[36:11] let's go see you next
[36:14] Sunday
