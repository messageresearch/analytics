your presence your love and your understanding thank you for you and we just ask you tonight that you would come on the scene in our midst Lord and we've prayed to you we've worshiped you in song we poured our hearts unto you through those things and offerings and everything else Lord and now we pour out our heart unto you on the point of opening it it up Lord that we may be able to receive you we love you and we thank you have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to us and bless your little bride around the world that's not hard to ask because you already promised it and Lord we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 12 and 13. and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to just come in a little bit got a few quotes I want to read relating to what I've been trying to do and then we will get into comments and questions and I encourage you for your comments because you know that way I learned more of what's on your heart and mind by questions and by you commenting on what you see in the things and we just pray that the Lord would have yeah we started this series 18 messages ago on the Masterpiece family and in doing that my full purpose was for one thing for us to you and I to recognize the day that we are living and the word for the hour that we're living in you know the part for us and and how that the full word is to come into being in this last days you see then we are to recognize our day and its message and I would that you would listen to that message or read it you know recognizing your day in this message because you know to most people recognizing your day in this message it recognize that God sent a prophet that's That's the basis of it and that's wonderful that's part of it but you know we'll read in here just for a second what he was talking about on paragraph 184 he's talking about people recognizing and he says the past 25 years Israel has just recognized that they're in the Homeland for something it was prophesied they'd have to be gathered again Isaiah said so we read it a while ago God help us to understand it all right paragraph 185. at the same time and listen the bride has recognized the evening light just begin to recognize the hungry Pentecostals have begin to recognize that them organizations hasn't got anything they was looking for they're so twisted and torn up since the time of recognition recognition he says you've got to recognize the world has recognized the Nations is recognized science is recognize the devil has recognized it's the time that he can wreck women wreck the church wreck the people he's recognized it and God has recognized that there is a people on Earth that he predestinated to life he recognized this in the time to send his message he did it the people had recognized it the bride time has recognized the evening light and if Sodom had been recognized Sodom had have recognized her day when she seen those Messengers come down like Billy Graham and Oral Roberts recognizes not just totally it's all together paragraph 196. he said it people get they recognize say Pentecostals oh my why don't you recognize your day recognize the day of the evening time it is here and it's here yeah that to vindicate the coming of Christ to vindicate it we're at the end recognize your day all right recognizing your day all right so there's no way we could recognize our day whatsoever as I've tried to bring you without God sending the prophet so we've we've gone through that part that he's brought the message and we're still reading the message and enjoying the the things that he taught you know and still getting more each time as we read and study and and things it just keeps unfolding because God always will read in a minute he always sends a prophet first sure because that's part of it because the word don't come to you and I the word comes to the prophet then it comes to you and I right a five-fold ministers involved then you're involved see and we come to that place but to recognize our day in this message he recognize Who We Are Luther recognized who he was that I've been over it and over and over maybe maybe he didn't recognize he was the angel of the fifth Church age Etc he may have you know I don't know that's no problem but he recognized one thing he recognized that it was time to preach the just shall live by faith all right and when that was brought forth then the people could make that manifest right all right so he recognized that and see what do we need more than anything they can put these up if they want to and we can read a little but page 34 of the church age book The revelation of Jesus Christ oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit all right we need a revelation more than anything now my point has been for us to try to understand ourselves amen who we are amen all right now a recognizing of the Prophet coming right recognize lady osia as being here recognize Russia coming this way China coming that way recognizing where the end time is wonderful but to recognize who we are and what we're here for amen we've got a purpose each age had a purpose all right Amendment right the East age come forth in this time and look what the prophet says number three of the quote makes 15 Revelations Jesus Christ and remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation in the book of Acts drop on down and he said he knows that it's a church and if the people get the true revelation of the true church in what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works come on she will be an invincible Army oh well we're just going to church we just playing around waiting you know waiting on the pope to come out of the United States and waiting on the the the woman to get in the White House and boy we'll get all excited then you know that's not exactly like he sounds like he's saying if they get a true revelation of what the two spirits were within the framework of the Christian church now what is two spirits that you and I need to deal with right and we say well I want them to Holy Spirit and the other Spirit of the devil all right but what about being the real bride in the spirit and what about coming down to the anointed ones with the same Holy Spirit they recognize what they're doing then we can recognize the day that we're living so you not have to worry if they get a true Revelation two Spirits within a framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit what discern and withstand the Antichrist Satan will be powerless before her that he'll even be as dwarf as he was in the time of Jesus Christ do we believe that well I just can't see you wowzy wowzy woo that's what brother 40 says you know but you know what I gotta tell you a lot of time about the man that told brother molts and why they didn't go out to the Moon they just went out you're in the desert somewhere but you know what you could have put him on a ship and sent him to the Moon he wouldn't have believed it because there's people that are just plain unbelievers oh they dope me up and done something you know see a lot of people have never believed it don't matter what they can't believe that's pitiful isn't it but listen what has been the purpose what we've been talking about a word for each age a messenger to bring the word we've been through seven churches and each messenger brought that message to that age but the people made the message alive amen or made it manifest the world didn't get upset even at the great Apostle Paul but when the people begin to talk like Paul amen and for God to be able to use them and things happen like it did in Paul not in the magnitude of one person no right see because it wasn't to be but what is the Greater Works that the prophet says we're to do he says now we can't do more Jesus because he died he done this he said because there's more of us more of us you know of course we're real good to quote we got to do the lesser works for we knew the Greater Works well praise the Lord go to work is there any problem with that statement you know I mean at least we could have a positive attitude right now look what he says here on number four about turn on the lights paragraph 35 and it meets that condition every time that God manifests his light the world itself rejects that life why it's written right in the Bible well they would reject it all like that right each age God has allotted so much of his word for each age and he always sends somebody to manifest that word he always sends somebody to manifest it right to make it known what is it going through three things he does she wanted him revealed makes it known in manifest Every Which Way that goes does it reveals it and then makes it manifest all right you see we're in the days of manifestation we're in the time of finishing it up if it hadn't have been for God sending a prophet that's where I love to read these things number five crisis Christ has identified the same of all ages and so in each age when God Lots his word for his age then when that word is ready to be manifested Now search the scriptures don't just take my word when that word is ready to be manifested then God sends down a prophet and reveals a word to his people well amen because that's the way we get it we get it my way of the Prophet messenger all right see then we got it in order look what he goes on to say in the unveiling of God I got 136. but this is spirit that comes upon the promised word for this age and brings forth and manifests listen not two tables of stone now what's he referring to ministering of the spirit back up above it read not the letter not two tables of stone not quotes but look but the presence of the Living God not a mythical thought somebody made up or some Houdini a trick but the very promise of God revealed and made manifest right before us think about her coach provided place of worship paragraph 110. and we find that in each age when God said a certain thing would happen here come that man alone and manifested that listen here come there are people alone and live that now what's he talking about you're talking about what we just read up above right that he sends a prophet that's what he's putting in the wording look here come that man along and manifested that he preached the message right here come their people under that messenger and live there that was God himself living in the people because it was an answering of his word see that's all I've tried to well everyone goes to the bottom I read it wrong again you read it but listen to try to see Who We Are we can talk about we believe that Luther's message we talk about we believe the Wesleyan message we talk about we believe the Pentecostal message we talk about we believe this message but what is this message see that's what I've tried to do with this series of trying to get us to recognize our day in its message me trying to get us to see ourselves all right we started out 18 messages ago talking on the Masterpiece family and in that we talked about the corn of wheat it died and went into the ground or it would have bought along and that was the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man and that came forth in the ages and then you come through the ages and there again the word dies and goes into the ground and comes out in two little shoots we call Luther you know stalked or something we call Wesley then we come to the shuck we call that the Pentecostals and then we talk about being back to grain again the original grain well see that to me then is each age or each group of people recognizing their age if not then we we'd be as his brother around and said that would have been something for Moses to come along and said well we've got to leave out of Egypt so it's a Nile River out here so we'll just build an ark that's what Noah done we're in the word we're building art we just have to be a little bigger you know well we got plenty of time we can build a good Ark but that wouldn't be recognizing their day the day they reckon it was the day they followed Moses out of Egypt right and see that's what I've tried to get you and I to see that that corn of wheat has got to come back to the original grain that went into the ground for a rapture right you remember that we spent all the time going through all of the things Masterpiece see not I would have shook all right then we begin to talk about how that the bride would come forth and in the end time to finish it all up that it would come out to be the fullness of the godhead bodily would be recognized in a bride to bring her to a rapture well yeah people don't want to talk about you talk about us being the foolish or the godhead by at SWAT brother Branham said we'd give the quotes if you want them call me write me I'll be glad to write them off but run in your computer this run in fullness of the godhead bodily and read one because what's going to bring about the rapture the prophet then he covers it real good and we gave it there where he said no leaven among you no denominational doctrines in other words brings the fullness of the godhead into a cry a bride see then if I've said things that the prophet didn't say let me know but if I said what he said at least you could amen what he said yeah but then we went from talking about the fullness of the godhead bodily we went on over into talking about the son of man that original grain that went into the ground would come back to the original grain again and be made manifest in a group of people in the end time Prophet bringing the message the bride to make it manifest all right then we went through talking about what that one standing in the midst of seven golden encounters like unto the son of man it was God right but everyone says there and we gave it said it's not a Prophet this is God but he was manifest in a many membered body called a bride remember that while we're in an honored denomination from standing are drawn out a bride right we didn't leave anybody out down to the ages to say that we were the only ones in the end time and let a lot of emphasis upon that you don't pull us apart from the rest we're not something special yeah we're just a special manifestation of God because that way all of the others are waiting on you and I Hebrews 11 40 right and see then all we got to do is become what the messengers talk is any problem with that urge you'd rather run a read a love story magazine or some story about something else worldly events and and we all look and read at different times guys but our emphasis should be upon the message that has been given unto us I don't care who's going to be president it'll be the one that God wants to be president I don't care where the pope comes from he comes from Gillsville Georgia I don't care he'd be the one God wants well he's in charge of everything well yet he's got a bride and that bride is going to be tried by the word is that right I believe it's what he said God of this evil age that the one where he said this bride will be tried to prove that she wouldn't fall like Eve did well I know I was thinking about that the other day and I said we talk about adoption we we talk about not praying for rain in a monsoon season a lot of people might not even know what in the world that means you know but it means when you're getting plenty of rain You Don't Pray For Rain you pray for it to stop right if you need and run you pray for rain all right and God can come on the scene and make that word manifest and we've seen that all right see recognizing Who We Are well and I'm just as honest as I can be now folks and try to be as much as I can but I don't believe we're the only people there are but I believe we've got to have our part I believe we've got to be our part of that body of Christ I believe around the world that God is manifesting himself in a many membered body called the bride of Christ the called out ones now bride's never been in an age nowhere that's everybody wants to talk about this and that yeah Luther was in the bright age but he was not in the age that he was living in physically he was but spiritually he was birthed out of that into the bride so we're never born again believer worked out of the age into the kingdom of God our kingdom is not of this world what do we care what they do see it's wanting to be right in the word to just find out who we are and thank God did it the scripture said it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves I remember we wasn't Rabbi Richmond talking about brother bisco at that time he said you know I can't help it if God chose me or Israel you know maybe a Jew I can't have power well so all you and I had to do with it was to accept this message when it crossed our path right and to see this is the word of the hour but now I hopefully admit with many doubts in my heart about why it is but to most of the people of this day it's recognized right around was a prophet that's that group going out of the way other group going this way right around was wrong here wrong here but what I don't understand I don't get it I'm honest man come here and preach he gets up here and he says run around is wrong well I'll try to hold it until he gets through because I do believe the word is true that spirit is subject to the prophets well you know what it may die he ain't no Prophet he's off the work but you know what you can't find out what a lot of people believe unless you let them open their mouth right right so the spirit Spud Victor him let him get up and run his big mouth but then when he gets through I say take your shoe off because if you can correct a prophet you must be God and I want to kiss your toe he said would you do that yeah oh and kisses though I might hit it with a hammer but my point is what when are we going to say to people that's not what the prophet says you that listen on the internet that's your choices but when somebody comes down there and said brother Rhino was false or running around was wrong here wrong there I'm not going to listen to that man again now if you do you're trying to get that bug on you come on you're trying to get the bugs trying to get on you and you're Latin it all right so yeah I'm sorry that's just the way I think well he said some good things so does the Baptist so does the Catholic The Beatles a lot of people thought they sound good I never did caring for it but I couldn't understand what they were saying I might have thought more of it if I could understood them but listen Church put it right down tonight now where we're at here and you I've done put now what I believe I believe around the world the bride of Christ is becoming the end time message now I believe that but it's our part here to just get our part right all right we're not to go out and convert them if they're preaching the truth they don't need to be converted that's not saying going don't go out and preach to them I didn't say that see that's what a lot of people think we got it here let's go get them bring them to Lula we don't need too many more little buildings sometime pretty full on Sundays and uh we are going to have seats sitting in these aisles and and big old screen downstairs where some can sit down there before we build on you know or build another building or something why go to there's no need of it because them kind of people they're going to come in and they're going to go out so you just let them come in go out you know see a lot of people can't just sit down and grind brother had a good illustration he said like a cat eating a grinding stone you say that's impossible no it's not that cat's tongue don't get in trouble because it's going to be wore out a lot but if one grain comes off every time that cat touches that grinding stone the grinding Stone's going away it's where God does great things he draws billions of gallons of water every day out of the oceans and seasons and never makes a bit of racket what was it the prophet said one hundredth of one percent or something out he gave it recognize Jesus when he was here some big great outstanding number was all that you know I mean not a big number it's small very small number recognized the Lord Jesus brother Branham was more recognized probably by the world than any messenger that's ever been because of the gifts and the things it was in his life still it wasn't seven billion people that heard the message but what has that got to do with anything well brother Dale and brothers I don't agree with you so what I want them to know I don't agree with them I mean that's why I'm just honest and straightforward fault I don't have time play ain't Kevin when I said if we don't hurry up we're going to be having services in a nursing home right well we're getting older folks a lot of us in here are already Pious what God promised us right and a lot of you are chasing close on our heels but recognizing Who We Are why can't we say we're the bride but like I said about the raising the hand part I believe I'm born again but I don't know where I'm into bride or not now that's that's forgiveness to say in Low Mentality I'm trying to get away from that word stupid word Josiah I'm trying to get away from calling him things but when are we going to start behaving like the message that has been given us to love these people that are off the word is that the way brother Ryan said it he said somebody at all then to come in he said sit down among you if he said love them he says they'll go out or come in one right but you loving them when he made that statement that day about he said I'd rather see love in a church than to see 5 000 people saved I thought oh let me listen he said because if you've got love in a church there'd be ten thousand or what a number used way up but to recognize Who We Are nobody in the Bible down to the church ages or anything I've made this statement over and over ever amounted to anything until they recognized who they were Martin Luther was a good guy but he was just one of the guys in the in the conventor of what you call them but yet when God come into man's heart you know that Martin Luther become known worldwide right amen brother Brandon what was it the little Kentuckian seventh grade education he said he used to it didn't even have no clothes wanted to get me an old 30 30 where I could go out west and become a guide you know and couldn't afford it he said friends wouldn't even talk to me go down the street they wouldn't even talk to me he said now I got guns some pretty nice ones and he said now I have to hide to be able to get a little rest because everybody won't talk to him right you know what can't you recognize what was said to David and David I took you from taking care of an old handful of sheep he did a major King no wonder the man loved God look what he's doing with him look what he's done for you and I established us in a word position until we don't have all that garbage can coming through trying to preach false Doctrine and get us lit off a name may be that we're intellectual word people you know they don't realize that's bragging on me I mean you know I can call you whatever you want to to me that's bragging to say you ain't nothing but word word word that's bragging keep on because that's all I do I love the word of God but I love to see it in the people as it controls us that's the only thing I can see that a rapture how do you get these virtues back here we're going to need them to go into Rapture right how do we get them what was it about 1980 where the Lord opened that up to me and said by the opening of the word the preaching of the seals and the things the message of prophet brought the opening of the word will bring the virtues well we're not going to get them studying Greer's Almanac well I'll just pray myself into it you know I'll fast myself into it go ahead we read our minute ago the prophet said it's not just you know letters it's a revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ and where he's at he's in you sister Gail well if I could just see Jesus open your blinded eyes and look around you see what I've been trying to say then not selling you something that the prophet didn't say we were and really matter of fact I withheld a lot of things if you just go in the message and read it to start in 63 especially 64. read the whole message series from there on out and see if that's not what he's talking about the grain of wheat the the fullness of the godhead the son of man and see if that's not what he's talking about a bride then think about it as I said so get ready now for somebody to think about what we said blue okay think about what we've tried to bring to recognize Who We Are our day in this message and to see what God's doing in this day Luther's done his day Wesley's done his day Pentecost has done his day we went through all of that we wrote around and said even a zusa Street represented Mary back there that was a carrier who said she was not the words she was a carrier but the word was inside of her I said one day then he had to come out and manifest himself okay we recognize Pentecostals in all the days and hours that we're living and we see it in the truth like us tried to bring out the brother even calls the Holy Ghost fell on Azusa Street 1906 calls it to genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost you call it the prophet another great prophet right well I just don't believe that well you're not doubting me if I read to you what brought around say it you're not doubting me well you only read part of it well bring me the other part I've always been open to just do one thing and that's bring to you when I believe God has given to me into my heart and this is not a new thing of just 18 sermons we preached on this I was preaching this in the 70s the dean brought me some cassettes the other day from back somewhere back in there and I was talking about faith 77 talking about faith we just didn't get into Daniel 70 weeks three years ago we were into that in the 70s and then I've told you and people think that's just you existing exhaust 19 and 69 in Athens Georgia that was my first sermon in this message that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be peace on a man the word made flesh in the end time you think I don't believe that more today than I did then what just keeps unfolding I can see now what it's going to take for you and I to get out of here you know what it's going to take somebody ready for the question you know what it's going to tell you and I are becoming the word and how do you become the word I see what is it uh I'll get it in a minute he said you become the word as you receive the word might be in perfect faith if you become the word as you receive the word but we sat down on our Hops and just play church and go to church and be good people and do everything else that's well and good or we can struggle it out and fight it out of our own natural we ways and beings to try to become what God wants us to be he's coming back after the word because that's what it's always been giving God to glory and honor for everything I saw something the other day I told my wife about it but you see I'm not afraid I've always preached what I believe not afraid I have no fear about the message that I've tried to preach I have no fear about somebody coming and attacking it and tearing it down don't have to do a lot of tactin for 50 years almost and you know a lot of you ain't like I am you know I've talked to people years ago I used to I don't get to talk nobody no more I reckon they just count me out and don't worry about it that's all right but I've sat down and talked with people I felt so sorry for him until they would try to quote something and they couldn't even quote it and tell you where it was at well brother Brown said so I said that's on page 444 something I would tell them where it was at you know because I felt so sorry for him they couldn't even quote I said well you'll find that right there you know here's a book read it you know why yeah if you're afraid of somebody quoting something contrary to your quote what you got I believe they all come together and make a beautiful picture who will be first questions comments talks someone out there on the internet call in Joe's on the phone because I'm not afraid I saw that and I said Thank You Lord saw something else but I just explained that to my wife but I'll leave that alone God it has nothing to do with anything we have something to do with me you see church if you know where you're standing you're not afraid when you don't know where you're standing you're scared to death right who'll be first to say anybody tell me what you believe Brother Dean you know tell me what you believe that's it I'll tell you what what I see out of the series you you preached it I see you bringing the form of God all the way back from in the back of God's mind before the foundation work right brought to form and the way the form was and what it did it the people that that received that form it's a mystery you've been bringing a mystery right all the way back before I mean before the foundation World exactly it's it the mystery has been it's been in the form of God and what God was doing like in the prophets exactly see it was it was going on the form of God was gone but there was a people that believed Isaiah these are people that believed Ezekiel and this is what he was doing he's he's coming down through his by his form or the form he's in from from Genesis 1 26 27 right you preached and Wade preached a lot see the mystery has been coming down in the mystery is what you've been preaching right I mean and I hope the people I mean I mean I could be here a week talking on this here but I know I got to move on but see you you brought to you brought to promise you brought the Lord Jesus Christ over the scene you brought what he done on the scene yeah it in the form of that and you brought to church ages you brought to seals you brought to Trumpets it's all in the message in this 18 just this 18 not counting all the rest of them but just in this 18. it's there so if people that don't understand the Mysteries ought to get busy they are to really seek God because I'll save myself you preached a lot of things over the years to me and it's things that I at the time I couldn't understand you'd say things and I'd meditate I'd pray and I was so desperate because I had confidence in I believed that it was a truth but I didn't understand it and I stayed that way until God revealed it to me and this is what I'm talking about and I don't know I I can't do it no justice is all because 18 18 sermons is is is and I just see it it's like that Roman Candle just exploding and God revealing to me see that mystery that come from back before the foundation of the world Amen because you can't add nothing to God and you can't take nothing from God but there's a people up here that's predestinated by the foreknowledge of God and they see that they are this is what I see Brother Sam they see that they are elected God elected them and and and when they see it from the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you've been speaking of by the Dynamics that ain't nobody thinks is going on they see it by that and God by that takes them back to where he put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and then he shows them his Destiny so I I just I just I just I would I would ask the people to look at the form of God right how he he God I mean how can you put it in the words bro Sam the mystery that I say right that's coming up through that I mean you could I couldn't I could I could stay here for a week and talk about what I see on what you preach just these 18 servers so but it's a it's a four I would say the form of God and the form of God's people amen all the way down he did this is what it come for I mean the whole picture of God is what you is what you preached right here in these 18 sermons amen God bless you Maria h and really the worst one but God has worked for me and I want everybody here to know about it yeah I can sit here tonight and tell you I am a part of the son of man I believe that folks if you're looking for something from God stop looking for some great big something right God is the only being that can get as simple as he gets and yet it is so magnificent as Brother Dean said words don't explain it I can't I read through the Mighty God unveiled and I was catching things as Brother Sam was preaching I run across the paragraph there or two one day I can't say God spoke to me out loud yeah but I knew just as well when I finished those couple of paragraphs that God had told me that was mine that I had it and you can't shake me from it now folks and if you're in that place keep going right pray for Revelation Gloria brother Dean's right there ain't there one of us sitting here desperate enough and I don't know whether we're going to get desperate enough or not till God beats his eye to death right but if that's what it takes so be it God has been most merciful to all of us I could look at me and I thought the other day I thought well this and that and the other about what's going on and I got to thinking on something about somebody else well I ain't got no problems right right but I just want to say that I appreciate you brother and I love you I love the Lord and I appreciate what he's done for me and don't look for no big boys and if you get something comes to you and you're not real sure just keep talking to him and meditating about it reading he'll Quicken it to you somewhere right it's like saying don't lost in quicksilvers guys he said I'll help you but you got to try right a lot of word in that that's true right amen brother Hank what's today oh I don't know uh I see something here and every time every time and I come here and I hear you I get a sense of peace and my life fell apart but everybody at this church has helped me and blessed me and the message that you put out there it gets clear every time I come and I thank you for that I thank God for you amen I thank God for Dawn and Susan and Mark and everybody in this place amen because everybody here has not turned their head when I walk by they've looked dead at me yeah and I appreciate that and I love every one of y'all amen I see what y'all got and I want some of it amen amen that's a good call me it'll be next just be salty it'll make you thirsty who'll be next I get up this morning and I generally get up and fix breakfast for my wife you know she'll be doing something I just cooked the breakfast and I'm good at cooking eggs and bacon at least I can do that you know but I got in there this morning I was thinking about that salty knife I've put a little salt in the eggs and I got too much she don't know it I turned around and throwed them out and cooked her some more because I didn't want her eating them salty eggs now that's too salty and I think we can't be too salty in the Lord who'll be next anybody with a comment thought questions or anything yet everybody happy I believe the word don't you I've always believed it and always wanted to do one thing and that's all I want to do is just see somebody receive the word it's your brain I don't have the ministries of these other brothers I'm not uh you know it bothers me that I don't have the kind of humbleness and the form of of anointings and things that these some of these brothers have and I I cherish that and I'm not joking now I cherish it and honor it but I'm just me and that's all it can be amen there's no need of trying to be anything else I've always just been honest and sincere about what I am but my point is not what I am is what you are to get you to see who you are the new birth is wonderful because that's the only way we'd never start I mean you can't even talk about it until you get to New Birth let's see the new birth is your baby that's wonderful but then you got to grow up and to see God work and do as he has Among Us in Mighty ways it's great for me
