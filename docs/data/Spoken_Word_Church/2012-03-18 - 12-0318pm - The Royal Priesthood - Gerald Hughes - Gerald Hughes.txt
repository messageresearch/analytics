believe i want to speak on the subject of the royal priesthood amen and um so if you'd like now to take your bibles and stand with me yeah thank you greg i believe it's first peter 2 9 i'd like to read to begin with here first peter 2 and verse 9. he greet you this evening in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ and um maybe just before we read the scripture we can talk to the author once again lord jesus we know that we're unworthy to approach the throne of your grace but yet you bid us to come with boldness and lord we can only do that through the shed blood of calvary's lamb realizing we have no merits of our own right but lord we're not here projecting ourselves we're here because you have made us to be here you have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance and lord you've made us acceptable and so now father we come through that channel a provision that you have made for us your children and lord we uh realize that as your servant prophet said the reason that israel had to stay in egypt for 400 years was because of the jealousy of one brother lord may there be no jealousy among us but lord may we prefer one another and may we recognize the position that you have given us and be willing lord to step into that position without any condemnation without any reservation lord as it's written he hath made us kings and priests under the lord our god amen it's your making lord so we come with that realization this evening asking you'll make it more clear to us that our faith might be able to be built up and we'd be able to reach out and receive appropriate all of these promises granted heavenly father forgive us of every sin every shortcoming now every wrong thought word or deed of this day consecrate us for this service this evening granite we pray as we read your word in jesus christ's name amen amen amen all right in first peter chapter 2 one verse of scripture but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light amen let's get verse uh six here of uh um revelation chapter one also while we stand revelations one and six and hath made us kings and priests unto god his father to him be glory and dominion forever you may be seated in the lord and we won't remember now that here in revelation he's definitely addressing the church ages that's right amen and we also understand and maybe we'll now that you're seated and comfortable and now that i have your undivided attention uh go with me then to colossians chapter one and we'll take two verses of scripture here and that'll give us a little better foundation platform to launch from amen and colossians 1 12 and 13. giving thanks unto the father which has made us notice here it's god's making amen giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance in the saints of the saints in life who had delivered us from the power of darkness that's right and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son amen i want you to notice there's a spiritual translation that has already taken place amen correct amen all right if this spiritual translation taken place or doesn't take place in time we won't be in eternity right right there are certain things that it are imperative now amen for us to be with him then right right if we haven't received if we haven't heard and received and acted on the shout right exactly then we can't be a part of the voice of the resurrection nor the trump of god right amen there's a shout a voice in the trunk is that all right amen and uh so there's a translation now that must take place spiritual translation right that we've got to come to realize is for us now right you see we can't always put everything behind the sky and abide by right right we're not called upon to rule and reign as kings and priests only in the millennium right right come on but he have made us right now right king right amen and priests and i want you to notice this is not for just the brothers come on this is not for i'll read you the quote here where the prophet of god said have made us sons and daughters kings and priests all right unto the lord our god amen you see there's an elevator where there's neither male or female in christ right glory oh my and when the royal priesthood of melchizedek come on amen which we have come to the question is not and the prophet didn't entitle his message who was that melchizedek he said who is this amen right and so we see that there's a a new priesthood that has come forth and been ordained far and above and beyond the old ironic priesthood right of the law right and this is after the tribe of judah of which nothing is mentioned concerning the priesthood right right but this god swore by himself concerning this priesthood amen sure and we know that jesus christ ever liveth to make intercession for us amen and the old ironic priesthood a priest would offer first uh a sacrifice for his own sins and then for the sins of the people but the bible says that jesus did this once hebrews chapter 7 and verse 27 i want you to notice it here maybe we'll read back up also now just getting a good foundation that the lord will help us let's back up to verse 25 of hebrews 7. everybody had your swords i tell you what you should never come to the classroom without your textbook all right amen our curriculum is the word of god amen shame on you if you come to sunday school without your curriculum that's right amen hey man they taught us in the army you better not lay your rifle down right now better keep it with you all the time you better know the number of it amen have some ammo ready right yes sir and so as sons and daughters of god we should always keep our shorts handy when he is setting up on high one place brother said this uh interpreting uh ephesians 4 he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men what kind of gifts swords all right amen swords so we understand that god taken his man but he didn't take the king sword and he certainly hasn't taken swords from us but he's given the swords amen glory all right and we all also understand that jesus was a five-star general amen our five-star champion amen and then as the prophet said he's put five stars up on each one of us right amen that makes us five-star generals yes was jesus ours is f-a-i-t-h right so we're all now what am i talking about an army of god right right man a royal priesthood right glory where the entire army is generals right five-star general amen amen how can we fail that's right amen that's right how can we fail right oh my god a royal priesthood now god made this army yep god made this priesthood he had made us right it's out of our own makings right right right it's not around to do it right right it's not the church is doing it right right amen it's god that hath made us right what we are you cannot when you realize that it's god that made you it don't matter what anybody else is jealous about right and you know the devil will be jealous over what god makes you because he can't be made that he's jealous over the position of fellowship even that you have with the lord amen because god loves fellowship and satan was one time remember co-equal with god in every respect except to create and brother branham said he was god's right-handed fellowship with but now he has made us that right and um it's wonderful to be called to this position right now we can't make ourselves that if god hasn't called you then you're just beaten in the air let's begin here hebrews 7 25 where for he is able also to save them to the outermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them amen now he is the great high priest glory and here you'll one of the quotes i have here before me brother brown said we're lesser priests lesser priest nobody will ever come to that measure that the head of the church christ we receive the spirit by measure he received it without me amen is that right now so notice here in verse 26 for such a high priest becometh us who is holy blameless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens he's exalted so high that he has to look down on heaven such a high priest became us i am he became us that we might become him all right amen he became us such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily i want you to notice this verse real quick uh real closely here right verse 27 who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer a sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did well she catch that part right this he did once right when he offered up himself right right what is it that he did this right sure the scripture is perfect right amen that's what offered up sins uh offered up a sacrifice for his own sins that's right now holy just a bit of pepe are you trying to tell me jesus had sins the bible says this he did offered us a sacrifice for his own sins he did that first this he did once amen now we know as believers that he had not of his own that's right but he took yours he so took them that he tried on himself right exactly oh my right man here it is this he did once right right it was his sins right nothing he said nothing he was a sinner but that he so thoroughly and fully took your sins amen amen but the bible says this he did all right ah man do you realize that god when he asked the question why hast thou forsaken me my god my god why hast thou forsaken me there was the tree of life cursed for your site all right amen because to read us of the curse right that we came andre in the first birth all right amen as we said this morning referring to the point said living he loved me died he saved me buried he carried my sins my sins for what he carried my sins he took my sin right amen that's right carried my sins see why did god forsake him because of your sins and hosea it says thou art of all together to pure eyes to behold sin god can't even look at sin right and it was your sins it's the reason god forsook christ right living he loved me died he saved me buried he carried my sins right far away amen he who knew no sin was made sin right cursed right exactly is that right right and god could not resurrect jesus christ until he first justified you because it was your sins that cursed him right amen and god could not resurrect jesus christ until you was first in the eyes of god justified right now amen rising he justified it's a finished work right amen glory what god wants us to see in the lesson tonight i believe is something he had made not what we can right it's what grace has done it's what the plan of redemption has wrought amen what hath god wrought right in jacob right hallelujah mine verse 28 for the law maketh men high priest which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore and he was not made a priest without an oath that he made he swore thou art a high priest forever right after right god swear see that he would be a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek that's right which had no beginning of days right no ending of life that's right brother adam taught us clearly amen that same one that meant abraham back there became jesus christ right amen amen same one all the time same person just a different manifestation that's right hadn't been birthed in flesh yet hadn't been made flesh yet right but it was the same same person all right just a different manifestation different form i know two gods not all three gods only one amen you know there's one thing god don't know right he's supposed to be all nice and all-knowing right but he said i know no other gods no not one there is no other god that's right amen that's one thing god don't know amen and he wants you to not know any other god that's right hey man but now what i'd like for us to see is how that he's calling us hey not calling us but he wants us to recognize the calling he already made right what he's already done right and uh in the scripture here if you'll notice um you are not will be you are a chosen generation amen you are a royal priesthood that's right this royal priesthood must come then under the order of melchizedek right hallelujah amen amen what is it little messiah right amen why did it have to be shepherds do you realize that the shepherds got the first announcement and revelation of the messiah on earth when the word was made flesh right and they preached that everywhere the bible says they went and heralded the message abroad for two years and then when the wise men came down he wasn't a baby in the major he was a child in the house the bible says that's right and they killed all the children from two years old and younger trying to get him right right so two years later came the wise men and nobody was any wiser has to know where the messiah was right why did it have to be shepherds yeah god chose humble shepherds right but nobody listened to him he hid it from the eyes the wise and proven all right shepherd know where she performed the shepherds knew where the messiah was and the shepherds was the first one to know that he was on earth right amen amen and true shepherds tonight today know that he's on the earth today hallelujah no not in a nail starting hand right now with his feet on the earth as we know that he will be in the millennium but he's here in his body amen amen he's here in brideform amen oh my not just a messenger come down no messenger to the age brother branham said and question answers to the seals they asked brother branham said what about it brother branham will the bride have a ministry and so forth and they also there he he said now each age had a dip in the holy ghost a dip in the holy ghost but now the holy ghost is here in his fullness but the prophetic prophet come down exactly in other words uh something come down something heaven right revelation 10 right amen there was a earthly messenger on the earth with this other mighty messenger of revelation 10 1 made his manifestation right the messiah is on the earth now that's the message of the hour and only the elected ones know that that's right only the elected ones realize that that's right he's here to present to himself a bride without spot or blemish amen now you say i'm brother huge you're going to confuse me how many comments is there anyway well there's only one nature coming to the lord that we're waiting for but remember see john the baptist could not be taken off the scene until christ come on the scene right right and then john when he introduced the messiah yeah said i must decrease but he might injury right and the second forerunner in the end time our malachi 4 4 runner luke 17 4runner etc is has already introduced us now to the reveal word our mate our husband all right and so there's an invisible union has to take place here right in this dimension amen and he wants us to realize what he has made us right right and that he's already translated amen from the powers of denominational darkness right from the powers of creeds and darkness into the kingdom of his dear son and the king is an invisible union right because the kingdom of god cometh not with observation all right right what is the kingdom of god not meeting greek but it's love joy and peace in the holy ghost no no it stands out that the kingdom of god is within you amen right amen if the kingdom of god is in you and the king of the kingdom is in you right right amen amen oh my now then he wrote into his creation i went white donkey but today he's coming on white horse see who is this see what is the attraction on the mountain brother brown said a few years ago services is a time this was a prophecy now it's history what's the attraction sure see what is the attraction what was the attraction when jesus come riding into jerusalem right it was the king coming into his kingdom right the creator coming into his creation amen he was presenting himself as a king right now you'd be rejected right sure you're not a horse thief the donkeys belong to you right he wasn't teaching his disciples how to steal donkeys he was exercising the power of a king right the beast on thousand hills belongs to him right america is that right sure he's king all he has to do is speak the word everything belongs to him he's a benevolent dictator that's what a theocracy is a benevolent dictator amen and so we won't let him be lord of our lives is that true right now if we can find our place and realize what he's made us see it's not that we can make ourselves anything that's right you don't have to that's right you're not designed like i said this morning the bride is not designed to produce a child right but paul said what the word of god come out from you right yeah party come on to you aren't we all right hey yeah right you don't produce the word you receive the word and glory the bride when she realizes who she is and what her position is she can rest and receive right right amen rest receive believe conceive and produce hallelujah amen eat digest manifest amen that's right and uh go forward then right now so i i i really believe that where there were just a testifier of the gospel or a minister of the gospel if you feed on the word the holy ghost will bring that word to your remembrance when you need it yes he said he would that's right but see the problem a lot of times is we've been feeding on the wrong thing right man amen we need to empty out so we get filled up right right amen amen right yes died down they just i have nothing in there but the word of the lord and uh then he can set that word in order in our hearts and lives right i really believe that that's right amen now we're not capable of doing it ourselves and that's why we're we we're asking him and trusting him day by day to lead us to guide us to direct us i want you to notice here uh how the prophet puts this in faith is the substance our bodies are groaning and we have an inheritance and we're children now heirs of the kingdom oh my kings and priests unto god offering spiritual sacrifices right what does a priest do make a sacrifice right what is a a spiritual sacrifice that's what these sons and daughters do which are kings and priests yet not in full possession right but they're making sacrifices offering to god spiritual sacrifices the fruits of their lips giving praise to him amen right giving praise to him amen fruits of our lips you say brother brett i just don't feel like praising him that's the time to make a sacrifice amen praise him anyhow kings and priests right sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifices the fruits of our lips giving praise unto his name right that's right they asked one outstanding minister one time what do you do when you don't feel like praying he said well i pray till i do feel like praying all right hey that's the time when you offer a sacrifice right you know and the bible says that we're to present our bodies right a living sanctuary all righty man holy unacceptable unto god we suggest our reasonable service by that that's right man is that right right and so a living sacrifice you know a dead sacrifice don't suffer but there's a measure of suffering left for you right amen scripture speaks to the sufferings of christ left back for the church doesn't fill up right and also inflicting says for unto you it is given in behalf of christ not only that you believe upon him but that you suffer for his namesake right right see we want fly our bed of ease right we want to just go in without any suffering yeah but no pain no gain that's right this character is only made through suffering right if our lord the the chief priest melchizedek himself had to learn obedience through the things he suffered yeah how many knows the bible says hey all right man hebrews he learned obedience by the things he suffered how much more do you now live amen oh my don't be afraid to do a little suffering paul said i reckon the sufferings of this present time we're not even worthy they're compared with what he hath made us amen what shall be revealed in us right oh my so we see here now that he's addressing the church and uh the seven spirits was represented in the seven spirits that would be sent forth to the seven church ages and um he had loved loved us and washed us from our sins loose to see right and from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests under god his father right to him be glory dominion forever and ever amen have made us priests and kings under god right us plural amen that's right not made me king made us all right the church amen all right now he's addressing the seven church ages for the seven church ages four it's the seven peace now he said dominion and glory be be to him forever and ever hath made us do you ever know what a priest is what is his what his office is a priest is to make sacrifice to make intercession right and over in hebrews it said that we uh the church is the royal priesthood a royal priesthood the church is a royal priesthood a holy nation amen a peculiar people offering spiritual sacrifices heaven every man and woman that comes to god enters into the veil amen amen aaron the high priest only once a year was permitted to go into that holistic hole yeah and then he better know everything's in order that's right because if he didn't have everything in order the bell stopped ringing yep i had to drag him out one way or another is that right right right get him out of there because he didn't he was he went in the wrong approach right right what a holy sacred god amen but now every member hallelujah he's invited because the veil was ripped from the top to the right and the mercy seat is in plain view and you have no excuses right i have no excuses that's right you don't have to go through some general overseer some pope or some bishop to intercede for you there's one mediator right between god and man amen one mediator between god and man and that's the man not the woman right the man christ mel and so we see here that every son and daughter has the privilege of entering in to the veil amen what a glorious realization into the sacred presence of god where the mercy seat is we're the cherubims amen wings tipped coming together there presence of god and the mercy seat see actually as someone put it you know we actually become the mercies right you listen to the message about the throne right uh 144 000 and so on and so forth and we see then that here god has called us to this position he's made us to be this now they said to the lord jesus if thou be the son of god come down off the cross if thou be now he didn't make himself right what he was he just recognized who he was right who he was right what his position was right right brother branham said that jesus had to search the scriptures to find his place right amen if the bridegroom had to search the scriptures to find his place what about the groom right or what about the bride amen right if the groom had to what about us exactly what was christ it was god actually limiting himself even though he was in the fullness of god he was limited in knowledge right imagine jesus didn't even know the day in the hour while he was here right he said not even the son of man knows these things right well he was here he did is that right right maybe it had been revealed to you all right so we then must realize that we're here on the same order with limited knowledge right that's why you got to have faith in that body be it's not how much knowledge you have lead not to your own understanding right only believe only believe that's what we're called to do is believe right amen and uh as i said before you don't understand in order to believe you believe in order to understand that's right and then god will give you the revelation understanding as as we believe as you believe amen now now that is true god called messiahs god called us we become kings and priests unto god like jesus was god's high priest we become a lesser priest jesus was god in the fullest dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of god to the world for god was in christ reconcile the world to himself and as god was in christ reconcile the world to himself god comes into his church and anoints him some messiahs anoint him some messiahs oh my do you see it the same thing he did in his church the same the same things he did is in his church right the same power he had is in his church amen and his church becomes his dominion amen amen and he's king over this dominion right amen he's king of kings yes sir right lord of lords amen kings and priests all right he he's king over this dominion and we are his kings and priests offering spiritual sacrifice to god the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name amen oh my there you are messiah messiahs little messiahs little anointed ones anointed of what it's the main one annoying off of the great one all right oh my there's certain truths that ought to be emphasized and this is one of them yeah listen closely church age book he says he has made us he has made us amen oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he he has made us yes salvation is his doing right salvation is of the lord all of grace glory he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings oh we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign a spiritual kingdom he says in romans 5 17 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life glory see shall reign in life by one jesus christ and then he goes to colossians 1 13 who have translated us or who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of here's your son that's right now right now we reign with christ amen having a dominion over sin the world the flesh the devil showing forth his praise and glory amen showing forth himself capital h i m s e l right showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing of his own good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus amen that's right all right that's eagle's food isn't it amen i like now ah isn't it wonderful to realize james stop to think if the lord jesus uh you let's just say you instead of me saying had you been there 2 000 years ago um and you would want the lord to pray for it or maybe we could say it like this if he was here today and you would ask him to pray for you on a certain need certain requests do you think that god could turn that prayer down if jesus asked for it for you no come on now give me a response what do you think right do you think god could turn him down well just think about this now when you pray in jesus name amen god doesn't see you he only sees the blood right right he hears your voice that's right but he sees the blood of the lord jesus amen and here you are now he said himself as the father sent me so send out you right he's got messiahs on earth he's got intercessors on earth and he's the intercessor in heaven he's got all these little intercessors down here and he's the intercessor in heaven right but he's also the intercessor in his dominion all right man see amen oh my god now uh his earthly strength i've got the quote here maybe i can find it for you uh um is the government voice that isaiah says unless a child is given somebody's born and so on and the government shall be aware and the shoulders is where right part of the body right right right amen and the shoulders then are speaks of his body which is his earthly strength we're we as kings and priests carry out right see right his orders yes and we help fulfill see in his dominion even that were the promise of the over to the overcomer of this age he that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my dominion right now uh even as i am overcome adam sat down with the father in his dominion throne is dominion and this dominion stretches from eternity to eternity right amen riches it's over the household of faith it's over the whole realm of the family of god right amen do you ever think now what the sweetest sound on the human ear is brother brandon said we're told it the scientists and so forth tell us the swedish sound on the human ear is the sound of your own name that's right and uh then we rightfully sing that song jesus it's the sweetest thing i know right why because it's the name of whom the whole family right both in heaven and earth and state amen so who is it all right yeah stop and realize right he made us that right right if he oh my god you know there's um uh 14 generations and 14 generations and 14 generations um to christ right three groups of 14 right right you know i believe that's in matthew isn't it if i'm not mistaken let's see if we can find that right quick um just uh simple enough to try to even though i didn't have that in let's just check that out i believe that's in the first part of matthew if i'm not mistaken you bible students can help me chapter 1 of matthew 17. thank you thank you very much let's see here now uh so all the generations from abraham to david are 14 generations now abraham's the father of faith that's the beginning of the faith scene so all the generations from abraham to david are 14 generations and from david unto the carrying away into babylon are 14 generations and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are 14 generations now three sets of 14 would be six sevens is that right right six sevens and uh when we look now it's it's not complete you got the six number six there right it takes the seven to be complete right right just like there was six seals but then he was the seventh right amen uh there were six water pots yeah yeah but christ was the one who turned the water into white he was the seventh right and in john 7 37 he said come unto me oh you the thirst you know and so forth and this he speak of the holy ghost uh which should act would be given right see by the church because he was not yet glorified right so it was imparted to the church to be the one who really parked this life right see that the greater greater works that's right all right now then we see that um where is his seventh coming in like the woman at the well she had six husbands or she had five and one she's with number six wasn't her husband but here come the sevens right christ the true husband yeah and we see them also we see the same thing in type here in um uh ruth because boaz the kinsman redeemer only gave her six measures is that right right six measures of barley and that barley can be eaten or it could be used for seed right but see that was a natural seed but it only spoke of something he was going to do and that's why naomi said rest yeah right yep boaz himself gave her seed right to bring forth even christ right right sure right oh man jesse part of this genealogy right speaking of the seed of life amen all right now so we see six here generations but here comes christ all right so until we got so and so we isaiah 52 said he was cut off who shall declare his generation amen the bride is the continuation of the new creation seven church ages comes out now rightly there's another seven right seven generations right from every church age comes forth those faces of christ they'll see gene of christ the bride will be called out of seven ages what is she amen yes sir is that right if we can only see ourselves in this priesthood amen and this priest in us right now oh hallelujah sorry brother my mama he hath made us kings and priests right if he was the beginning of the creation god made adam and he made eve at the

these laws right riley i got a possession i got rights and the devil's trying to come and trespass right steal away my rights right you can intercede you can start you can call i'll read it we're not calling all right 911 down on your knees remember the greatest weapon ever given into the control of man is prayer yeah that's right yes sir greater than any atomic bomb greater than any hydrogen bonding jesus on the main line now if there's no condemnation in your heart the bible says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now if you've been walking after the flesh fulfilling the things that flesh you ain't going to have no faith to call nothing you pray gonna get nowhere don't get it by the ceiling right right see the importance of living a consecrated life amen listen brother man said when you first received god he said just about the size of a button yep a little light right yep comes into you right he said and as you pray and you consecrate yourself that grows and it'll push out all bitterness all in be all jealousy all stripes all the sins of the world all unbelief right that light will grow and you become light right amen amen and he's telling about that glory and then he says as you consecrate yourself then the holy spirit can lead you and he said i see it happen to me i was up at the hospital elijah perry had died my boyhood friend we was raised together and he was riding spider on the railroad car and he got crushed and then from that he got tb and bled to death and died in the hospital and he said i was fixing to leave because he was dead he said i turned away from him and there was a sister schaefer or something like that there he said i felt a hand on my shoulder i thought it was sister shape the shackler and uh i turned and it wasn't sister shatner dawn and he said i started to leave again and all of a sudden he said i found myself up on the bed of elijah perry yeah now here's two omnipotence meetings two elijah's coming together hey man hallelujah and he said my lips was on his lips and blood all over me and he said first thing you know he said i felt something coming up around my ear and it was elijah perry's hand doctor has already pronounced him dead they've been bled to death and everything else but see he too omnipotence right and he said he's come to the church here and testified about it he lives down here on this on the curve and he said that some 27 years ago how long has it been now yeah yeah what is it god confirming that we have another elijah again today right but see it started out with just one little button of light yep right that's it yeah see he don't want to just remain one little button of light in your heart right that's right he wants to be lord of all hallelujah he wants to have the preeminence right right amen is that right he wants us to be led by his spirit right he wants to calm down with your dwelling you with your temperament right see yeah he doesn't change your temperament he designed you that way right the way you are certain bells have a certain ring to them right depending on the alloy and the mixture and the way that bell was formed and molded amen and then you see as a son and daughter each one of you have a little different ring right each one of you but god loves you all right if you hadn't made you if you had not want you that way you wouldn't match that way right i'm not talking about your car always i'm talking about just your temperament right the holy ghost god comes down jesus christ comes and dwells in you with your temperament right thanks the thoughts that he would think through you right speaks amen his words through you performs the works that he would do here on earth through you amen right why it's his earthly strength the government is upon his shoulders hallelujah amen and we are called as a royal priesthood and if we really realized how much power and authority was invested into us i am sure that we'll do a lot more than what we double portion is promised to us right yes sir the spirit of elijah was upon elijah in a double portion right right i used to think oh that's asking too much that's so you know i you we can't we can't that would be wanting yourself to think you got a double portion yeah listen you better get away from that little five attitude right god wants you to recognize who you are do you realize the reason basty was put away from king of hazuris and esther chosen in her place because she wasn't willing to come and show forth the glory and her beauty to the king right when god does something to you or for you he wants you to testify all right don't be ashamed of what god has made you glory and you'll never be anything or get anything until you confess it right all right i may baptize you up here brother you just forgive me if i smile on you but it's like a horse said in tall clover you know right right i just you start slobbering do you realize what god won't you see don't be ashamed to show forth peace he's not your glory it's his right amen he made you what you are right come out of this inferiority complex right amen an inferiority complex will make you act superior sometimes yeah when you should yeah sure and um we used to have a little sister she was kind of very timid you know wouldn't hardly talk with anybody or anything she ended up we kept praying for her while she she finally came out of that you know married and just really her whole personality changed yeah i won't call her name but real sweet sister and but uh you know that's many times i think that's our problem oh poor me i'm just little old me you know and i know my background and i know my family life and i know my weaknesses it's all that's supposed to be in the sea of god's forgiveness long as you refer back to that you can't do nothing right exactly you won't never be nothing right right but see god's trying to shake us out of that right take see that's your earthly identity right oh yeah that's your earthly again right oh that's that old book of life yeah is cast in the sea of forgetfulness right and now your new marriage all right and your new life is in the lamb's book of life don't listen to invisible unions if you don't understand what i'm talking about go read the church but yeah see now your new life and your new record hallelujah in the last book of life all of that other though it was recorded and it was sacred your natural life and history but all that's cast in the sea of god's forgetfulness right not even to count it against you at all your old husband everything he's dead all right amen and now you're married to the revealed word yes and you know what god does i'm gonna be pretty brief here now i'm not just gonna keep carrying on i don't think just think now folks what he does for us my brother he exactly away all of our spiritual amnesia yeah right you know when we is born here in this dominion in sin shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies yes the nature of the world on us in the message north it not brother branham said you received the nature uh of on your spirit which was that a worldly nature your soul yeah now with it not he said now it was permitted of god didn't come from god he said if it's permitted to god okay god didn't give nobody something worldly right but all life comes from god remember to the fact we was born in sin we had a worldly nature on our spirit right exactly and that nature has to die right now that's the old husband yeah there is where the new birth comes in right right there is where the new birth comes there and what's god begin to do when that happens he starts amen shocking you back into reality to take away all of your spiritual amnesia that she was born with see you know who you are you know what you've done you know your guilt you know this you know that but he tries to he's not just tries he does it and he's here to tell you right now it looks like a contradiction but you've got to believe the word okay right got to believe the word where it looks like a contradiction that's where the revelation lays right let me play the part of the devil's advocacy here just a minute before i close say you're a message believer huh you believe the prophet of god let me tell you something your prophet said your prophet said you never sinned in the first place i can show it to you in the message you say you believe the tapes i can show you where he said you never sinned in the first place and my bible your mind do you believe the kingdom right sure it says you was born in sin you were shaped in iniquity you come into the world speaking lies you're guilty right yeah right but here the messenger comes right it looks like a contradiction because he says you you right you honey you you you you you now you believers never sinned in the first place right you was born of the spirit of god you never sinned in the first place right now what what could that be that's only god speaking via of his vindicated prophet messenger from the sea of god's forgetfulness right yeah come on now right which is the blood of jesus christ sure amen through the blood god has pronounced you justified right he's pronounced you perfect right amen he's pronounced you married right he's pronounced you kings and priests he has made you that and he's trying to tell you that's your position right right he's trying to tell you and me i'm preaching to me as well as you know i'm guaranteeing it every time i get up in the morning i meet my worst enemy when i look in the mirror right all right that's right amen worst enemy i've got standing right here in shoe leather all right man amen but now look god's here to tell you amen right he's here to take away all your spiritual amnesia amen i am closing but look what causes amnesia shock worry now there's no worry in faith right well i wonder if i'm christian i wonder i wonder if i'll ever make it wrong i wonder if i can make a commercial i want to bring up the holy ghost no wonder i wonder that's just a watering star right but there's a way you can know right there is a confirmation and a vindication of what the holy ghost is right there's some evidence in the holy ghost right it's the same as it was never church 18th and you're living here right that's the word it's the abilities in the hearing not in the speaking and the hearing all right i am blessed are your ears amen hallelujah the evidence the holy ghost is the same today as it was in every church all right can you hear the word can you believe the word yeah see say amen to the words can i do it all right you're having this the holy ghost i showed you his sheep right do you know the baptism the holy ghost he said in one place a temporal gift sure right he said the real gift is that seed gene down in your soul what about that one that is a good one you could have the holy ghost every day your life but if you ain't predestined to see gene down your soul didn't come from god you can't go back to god judas had the same anointing that was on paul's right david and psalms i believe over there said let his bishop be given to another yeah right that was the bishoprican office that judas was called to was given to paul same holy ghost anointing but on judas it be not denied and crucified the word on paul it brought the gospel to the gentiles wrote most of the new testament right confirmed the word is that right that's right oh my something god had made right see and he's here to give to us his own mind his own word his own faith amen he is here to tell us what he hath made us reveal to us what actually uh he ordained us to be from before the foundational world to reveal to us our origin to reveal to us our destiny to reveal to us our true identity exactly what is the symptoms of amnesia people forget who they are amen what their name is right forget where they come from they don't know their address their phone number amen they're origin right they're pedigrees yeah but when one of the cures you remember brother branham showing us one of the cures for amnesia i think it's i don't remember this after world war i wonder world war ii i think it's probably world war ii but they had these soldiers i think they might have been some of the french soldiers uh for the merlot but he's talking about how that they they had amnesia and they didn't have no identity no dog tag or anything so they didn't know where they come from they didn't know what to do with them because they were they were they were healthy right but they had amnesia they could eat they could work you know they were healthy but they didn't know who they were right and so therefore there was kind of like a you know instead of really being an asset there was a liability you can be healthy yeah you can be strong yeah but you're still a liability and not an asset to the kingdom of god unless you know where you come from where you're going who you are and what your power and what your authority is and what your position is amen right but they put them on the train and was taking this sanatorium somewhere you know and this trains predestinated that god stopped at the right place and they let some of the soldiers get off and rest themselves stretch themselves a little bit on the old train and maybe the train stretched back out into the suburbs of the little community where it stopped for a whistle stop and so the soldiers let the or the guards let the soldiers get off and look around a little bit and one of these old one of these soldiers with amnesia started acting a little strange so the guard watched him and he he found a little pathway in he he got on this path over the railroad tracks a little up there in the terrain and he said well we got you know a few minutes i will just follow him see what he does and uh so the guard was watching this soldier and he went over the hill and he stayed back distance watching him from behind you know and then he sees a little house over in front of the soldier and in front of this house on the porch was an old man sitting sitting a a rocking chair rocky and uh the old man began to raise up as he sees this soldier coming you know toward the house this man coming toward the house and so as he raised up and it's the uh this man with amnesia seen him and uh his father comrade to meet him and he said oh my son my son oh hallelujah glory to god my son and he said daddy daddy daddy the train had stopped to the right place he had found an old familiar pathway amen hallelujah the old gospel track he said amen and then his amnesia left him right would the god dark amnesia would lead us right amen amen father's business come home come on home back to your true identity jesus said i come from god i go back to god we must say the same thing right amen we must know our origin right we are his offspring not some other being but right from and part of the eternal god there's only one source of eternal life and that's joey if you're ever going to have eternal life it's his life hallelujah that he predestinated for you right receive it tonight if you haven't already surrender yourself yes sir amen we can be followers of this message and still not have the very life of god manifesting in us like we should amen is that true oh may the lord help you to be this royal priesthood and manifest accordingly that's our hits lord jesus how we thank you for this opportunity now to examine ourselves in the light of what you have made us to challenge ourselves and each other to see if we are a fully believing receiving and accepting and acting upon these positions and promises that you've made to us of who we really are having a dominion already translated hallelujah into the kingdom glory having received the kingdom hallelujah which is the headship of the word yes our kingdom is the headship of the word translated into it overcomers sitting with him in his exercising with him government up on our shoulders power and authority given to us against the devil over the world right now over the flesh over ourselves over these habits right over these little complexes that we get lord i'm sure that if i was to ask for a show of hands right here tonight how many has a complex about it maybe being a little inferior or whatever maybe you've been hurt or something like that boy i'm sure many hands would go up lord but dear god may they raise their hand in their heart without me even asking for it and say

communicate to offer sacrifices of praise to worship to sing the songs of zion always in their heart pray without ceasing making melody in their hearts hymns and joy and so forth lord i pray that you will help each other not just to go back into our own little cocoon or something like that our little world of feeling sorry for ourselves melancholy lord may we rise and shine now give you praise

little amnesia still in their spiritual life god may they cry out for revelation may they understand father it's not we that can do anything but we are your workmanship created as ephesians 2 10 says

there it is one more time oh oh oh is there is a place like is is when we anoint with oil i'd like to invite the elders that would like to at least to join us in prayer for brother marlowe he's changed the doctors has changed his uh diabetes medicine and uh the devil is trying to tell him he's got a little bit of parkinson's but uh he's too young for that that's right in fact i don't think he the bible says as our days are so shall our strength be right so that's the promise of god there's no age limit on healing amen amen that's right and so let's let our faith reach out now remember we have the authority we have the privilege we have the right to call the holy ghost enforcer on the scene and we know the devil is trespassing on god's redeemed property amen so let's rebuke the devil by faith now okay let's bow our heads as we lay hands upon our brother whom we've anointed with oil heavenly father we thank you for our brother lord and savior and we believe him to be a real seed of god thank you we believe him to be a real son of god and lord and lord we're asking you not only lord blessings lord as he takes this medication uh in the name of jesus christ for the glory of god we are in the kingdom of god hallelujah with authority over the devil in the name of jesus christ we receive these blessings remembering that you said whatsoever thing you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it so father we give you testimony now an expression of our confession and you're the great high priest who is interceding right now hallelujah let my brother go forth with full assurance now father as we're agreeing with him for total deliverance in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen anybody else would just like to come i mean let's believe and let's see see what truth really is what are your faces amen anybody else appreciate brother yes sir anybody else just come and let us believe let's believe and see oh you've got have to do it i'll leave you with me amen our sister is asking for strength now uh she's received the word of the lord that went forth tonight she don't want to be a asset or a liability but an asset something that's needful right she wants to be an asset and not a liability is what she said and uh how many i that's what i yeah if the government's on your shoulders that's the strongest part of your body right and we don't want to let the government of god down is right right yeah exactly and so in this dominion now we've got to take that authority and our sister wants to be a real asset and not a liability from this day forward and uh let's all agree not only for ourselves but for her that god will grant us that ability to do that right amen whatever the holy spirit speaks to your heart about we go forward i appreciate her boldness amen all right openness to desire that that's exactly what the holy spirit has called us for right right that's right so let's pray together with her and for different ones that have raised your hand to do the same thing and we're agreeing together with her now lord jesus that we will just be led by the holy spirit that will be sensitive that will be manifest in the apostolic order lord as there was prophets and prophecies lord and these powers of god are not limited just to the man but to the women heavenly father and lord we pray you'll anoint her dear god we remember even stephen's uh or philip's daughters that prophesied and so forth and lord we know there's a place in the kingdom of god not that we're here to try to emphasize the gifts lord but we're here to magnify the giver oh knowing that your presence and all of the emphasis should be placed upon you but father you've made us something and we want to recognize what you've made us so that we can take authority now and be a real asset not only to ourselves not only for our families but lord for the entire kingdom of god as one individual represents the entire body of christ the entire church of christ help us now master encourage my sister give her strength from this day forward to be a real asset to the kingdom of god sensitive led by the spirit yes granted in jesus name each one of us anybody else though let's just believe him okay anybody else who'd like to come just be praying yes you know yes amen i think it'd be good one more time for our sister the elders would come uh it is a form of sickness and affliction and i think this the doctors call it insomnia insomnia she can't sleep she still wants to come to church though amen that's good she's fighting her way and uh but the devil would love for her to come to churches to go to sleep in church but the lord is here i believe with all my heart to touch her and give her her heart's desire she's not giving up amen and uh so let's believe with her now if there's anything see that would hinder this healing this deliverance may the lord reveal it and to her individually and that we should be able to get that out of the way that she could receive there's no lacking on god's part amen god his promises are gay and amen there's no failure on his part and so if there's any shortcomings it would be something and if there is anything now that we've she's been praying for several times she expressed and uh so uh if there is something let's pray god reveal it to her that's right and then she can get it out of the way and receive her healing and uh so uh we're not here to try to discern her thoughts in the intents of her heart or anything but the holy spirit knows what it is glory and he's able to minister and reveal anything that would hinder amen right so let's pray now for her as we lay her hands up our hands upon her and i annoyed her with oil amen lord jesus and restored whatever amen anybody else thank you amen amen amen we believe we thank god for the truth yes enjoy the message today amen our brother being with us you know the word that he's delivered unto us and then let's just take it let it be about our hearts and minds that we may become amen as he was saying this morning to where we know who our head is and he's the revealed worker not just a letter you read the letter of the word and holler this is my head all you won't talk about but if it's not revealed amen that's right not a head that's right it's a good knowledge right but it's not a heater that's true right it is revealed work yes i believe so you just telling me we appreciate you coming being with us and everything today and pray that the lord will bless them as he travel on back and and be with them you know just let his light shine in his heart and life we appreciate her sister coming with him so let's just be dismissed remember pray for brother richard brooks will be with us the lord
