wonderful job this weekend good to have a a group of ministers that you can depend on and and uh and know that they know the word of God and they know how to they know how to bring it so we appreciate brother Lis and brother Aaron and and brother Bob for what they did this weekend while we were gone we had a real good time at Brother Richard Wilson's it's good to get back in fellowship with them he's a uh a wonderful brother in the Lord and we've always enjoyed his fellowship and his son Steven's coming here the end of September um uh the last weekend of September so he'll be here with us for that uh that weekend so good to be back if you got your Bibles turn to the Book of Job I don't know why we're going to do job job it just come up this way no what I was thinking about the other day we were we started on the isua street or or the uh Pentecostal Holy Ghost falling on the day of Pentecost in 1906 but I kept going back that week and and praying about what to speak at uh at brother Richards and then this thought came on my heart this is we're going to talk about justification but we're going to make sure that we remember that justification is not it is a one act it is a one um God's going to forgive you of of your sins and then you have the sins again and then you have sanctification then you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if we can't believe that all of our sins all of our sins are forgiven then we got a problem amen and we sin every day so there's the par brother R said we sin every day because we're born in sin amen we can't help that adamic nature being attached to our spirit but out of our soul gone just as just as God is so we're going to speak tonight on the just not shall the just will live right by faith we're a faith group of people we believe things we can't see we believe things we've ever seen in our life which would been the day of calvary or the day of the Resurrection we were not there personally to look at it with our eyes but we were there with him and so we are identified when we receive the new birth you're identified with that you're identified with hanging on the cross cuz he thought of you while he was there he died for you and me he didn't die for himself that's right he died for us amen so that he could be the justifier there's got to come to a point that has to be one one righteous judge and we'll read that last scripture we read tonight Paul he's coming to the end of his road and he said Jesus Christ the righteous judg what a mighty God we serve let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day thank you for the time that you've given us Lord I pray that you'd be with the ones that are sick be with sister June Lord continue helping her and raising her up Lord be with um Lord our friend from a long time ago Dorcas Williams her daughter is going through some things same things that Hannah went through Lord and and we pray that you'd be with her she called and wanted us to make a special prayer through sister Joyce Lord I pray that you'd bless it that situation Lord and you're the only one that can do that Lord you're the only one that can take somebody that's Bound by sin and bound by drugs and alcohol and you're the only one that can set them free and I pray that you'll do that father also our cousin Tina Crocker her daughter comes today and and visiting with us and said she's doing better but Lord she's only weighs like 110 lbs little small frail um girl that they don't really know what's wrong with her and we pray Lord that the great physician will take over and that you'll F that you know exactly before the foundation of the world what was wrong with her and I pray Lord that you'd bring it even bring it to the doctor's attention and bring it to their attention so that they can maybe give her some medication or something Lord that you've give we believe in healing Lord but we believe also that you put things in this earth for us to take Lord to to help with the healing process father be with us as a church group Lord I pray that you'd be with us as we continue down our our Life's Highway Lord and our paths we pray that you'd be with each one father forgive us of our sins bless us in Jesus name amen job 25 let's let's read let me tell you something um I've been reading on Smith Wigglesworth because I've been speak um speaking to myself been preaching myself a sermon of Theus Street Pentecost how that started we always say isusa Street 1906 and then we just kind of leave it there my what a powerful thing it was I mean it struck the world in the the the baptism of the Holy Ghost struck the world people would walk into church and two minutes later they said would be slain in the spirit just walking in because they come off the street there was so much power in that church where is that power now it should be greater now amen should be greater now than it was then and let's see where it comes from SMI Smith Wigglesworth said the Bible is the word of God Supernatural in origin Eternal in duration inexpressible in Valor infinite in scope regenerative in power infallible in Authority Universal in interest personal in application inspired in totality ity whole words inspired read it through write it down pray it in work it out then pass it on Amen so we're going to read it right now job 25 now brother Bob's been speaking out of the Book of Job and let's look now we're going to look today and and we're going to see that this may take us down a little different path than you may be thinking now so job is looking remember is looking for a redeemer he's looking he he's looking for answers to the questions is why why are my children gone why why I'm on a as sheep why why is my wife turned against me why he's asking these questions and here's one question he says how then can man be justified with God now remember when we get to the end of the book we are rightl we are but with his Revelation at the time in the Old Testament he's made all the sacrifices he's everything he's supposed to do cuz remember you will you were not ever justified in the sight of God in the Old Testament right you were covered all right you were covered to Calvary and then that took care of it but at the moment in time job is saying how then can man be justified with God or how can he be clean that is born of a woman every one of us have been born of a woman the brother B said born between Satan and Eve so job asked a question how then can man be justified with God because remember Justified means what righteous that means you're just you're just as righteous as God is if you've been Justified job couldn't find that now he found his Redeemer he found the person that was going to do it for him but he never came to that justification but you and I can you and I don't have to ask question anymore I know how I can be justified with God I know that my first first birth did not make me clean only my second birth is what made me clean all right we're going to read habca 2 and then we'll sit down for the vision is yet for an appointed time now remember there was a there's a vision and you and I have got to get a hold of that vision and then make it real because if there was a vision as we preached many years ago in Jamaica brother R had a vision of of people going up and down the mountain and a vision of Jamaica on fire and all these different things and I preached a sermon I told him I said you got to get into that Vision amen you were seen of a prophet there were people seen of a prophet doing these things I said you got to get into it and make it manifest cuz if he saw it and it come from the mind of God it has to come to pass so we have been given a vision Beyond any Vision anybody's ever been given brother random went all the way way to the past the curtain of time into the curtain of time and went all the way into the future home in a vision but now we got to fulfill those parts of those Visions so for the vision is yet for an appointed time so we have an vision for an appointed time today but at the end watch it shall speak by thy words you'll be justified and by your words you'll be condemned but at the end it shall speak and not like though it t wait for it my habca it's been like 4,800 years since habca spoke this we're taring for it amen hallelujah because it will surely come it will not t we might have to tear but it won't then the summation of that is behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him how many people have you seen try to justify their s amen don't ever try to justify yourself because you cannot do it there is no way in the world you can justify yourself but the just shall live look by his faith you may be seated in the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word now we're going to get into something here that may be a little different than what you what you saw brother uh Bob touched on it not too long ago on the seals about the mystery of iniquity but we're going to talk about it right here look at go to Romans 3:23 three and watch now Paul Paul is now he's on the other end of Joel I mean Joe job's over here said look how can a man be justified how can a man is born of a woman be clean Romans 3 Paul say the same thing for what all have sinned all let's say all together all have sinned and come short of the glory of God so there's nobody that came this way and others come this way hello somebody all right only in the mind of God was there a group of people that made it up here than down here Genesis 126 man it is that man is different but God saw it would be different because we were in the mind of God and we received it down here and he knew that people like Adolf Hitler and different ones wouldn't break wouldn't make it right but we've all got to come the same way we've all got to come born in sin we all got to come shaped in iniquity we all have here that we come here speaking lies Paul says for all have sinned and come short this is Paul a prophet a church age messenger he includes himself in that for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God now being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in who Paul no Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through what here we go again the just shall live by faith no the just will live by faith if we're going to make it out of here we got to have faith for a body change we got to have faith for Rapture and it's a different kind of faith I'm telling you remember brother R I read you many times he said faith alone won't do it cuz we got to put that faith into action we got to put that faith into Works whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood sorry brother Louise to declare his righteousness not yours his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed I read this not too long ago remember you cannot be forgiven for sins that you haven't done yet don't ask forgiveness for something you're going to do tomorrow no you got to wait till tomorrow if not you're a Catholicism that's what they do that's what the that's what the mob does they say I'm going to kill 14 people tomorrow and they say okay say 14 hell marriage and give me $25,000 and you're absolved well that's not the way God works you only forget listen Grace is not for the future Grace is for your past don't get quiet on me Grace is for your past it is not for your future right the remission of sins are for your past because remember tomorrow we're going to sin according to the word of God tomorrow you're going to sin you're going to wake up depending on eating you're going to wake up somebody's going to cut you off in the road you your boss is going to be a little bit mean to you your wife's going to say something a little sideways have I hit anybody yet okay thank you brother boy maybe all them other ones are perfect so through through the forbearance of God so God is longsuffering he he knows we're going to do this he knows every move we're going to make everything we've already done and everything that we're going to do he already knows that but he's all but we have to remember that he is all sufficient with a plan before we got here knowing what we would do he had something there a provision to get us out right slow down yes okay now watch what Paul says to declare I say at this time his righteousness listen folks we got to find his righteousness first I know this is Elementary but it's getting somewhere but we got to find his righteousness don't look at yours don't look at your neighbors you look at his righteousness he says we're perfect amen he says we've already made it he says we're The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ he said we're without spot and without wrinkle he's already said that that's right when are we going to connect to that and believe it come on amen that's what I said believe you're going to have faith you will have faith and you will live by faith because right now at the point you're standing today I know what's running through some of you's mind and mine too I did this yesterday I did this a day before I did this yet last week if you're not nodding your head then pray for me um brother John pray for me okay okay brother pray for you too good to see you buddy so whose righteousness are we going to declare ours his all right now under baby form and when we first get Justified you've got to believe that the righteousness of God is what takes your sins away right amen and puts them somewhere he can't even find him himself you got to believe that if not you're not justified right you got to really believe that am now watch to declare I say it this time his righteousness that he might be just well we know he is and the justifier you got to have a justifier you got to have a judge s sitting on the bench cuz you if you if you let the defense run the court they're always going to win right if you let the prosecution run the court they're always going to win you got to have a judge standing in the middle to judge right from wrong and remember God doesn't need counsel maybe some judges need counsel or or judges down here need books or they need previous laws or previous ways this was this was um uh this case was handled but God doesn't need that right he's a righteous judge so that means he does things right and he's the justifier of him now watch which believeth in Jesus too simple but he's the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus all right Paul where is boasting then it's excluded you can't boast you can't say I didn't do it because you know you did but the righteous judge can take and he can he can wipe your record off amen by what law of Works nope but by the law Here We Go Again by The Law of faith the just will live by faith therefore here's Paul he brings it all together therefore we conclude Paul's preaching that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law am amen praise God because the law condemns you every time that's what condemns us now what takes us to court now if we if we have to go to court what takes us to court you did something wrong they not going to call me tomorrow at 8:00 in the morning and bring me to court for for a a driving violation and I ain't even got my car yet the only time you get in the courtroom is when you've done something or you got to be a witness so we are justified by faith without the Deeds of the law now I was thinking this is where we're going to kind of switch gears a little bit and go on what brother Bob was talking about the other day a couple weeks ago maybe let's turn to Revelation 6 ver1 one now we know we know that when we come to a realization that we're lost and we ask God to forgive us there's a point there to where God forgives you your sins but it doesn't take away the one that made you sin everybody with me but now there is a time and a place where we're to be justified by the statute of perfect man amen that it Works into your spirit realm and your memory reason conscious effects and Imagination what did Paul say do cast out reasoning cast out all right cuz see when we get to Luke you you in justif in sanctification the unclean Spirit goes out that's exactly right he's talking about your soul but when that Soul's sealed in God's going to start working on the outside guy so then that same set of demons is going to bombard your spirit realm cuz they can't get in in your soul Satan can't get in your soul cuz look Satan can't go anywhere there's eternity amen amen he cannot he cannot get in anywhere that's Eternal that's his problem that's what he wants to do he wants to be above God he wants to be over here do you know he was perfect God made him perfect amen that's right amen God made him without sin that's right come on he said I've made you perfect until what iniquity was found in your heart he knew what Satan would do but Satan couldn't help himself let's read this right here now we know we're looking here at the mystery of iniquity but let's remember that the first seal also shows one God now to see that you've got to see the mystery of iniquity you got to see where that iniquity is at everybody with me that's why brother R could say here stands a lamb with a book in his hand all right Revelation 61 and I saw when the lamb and opened one of the seals and I heard as were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts now we know which one did that it was a lion l i o n so there was a Ministry loosed in the first three Church ages we've already been through do this but just a background just a minute I want you to see something there was a Ministry loosed first because the lion brother randam had the book who had the book The Lamb had the book the perfect one had the book The Righteous one had the book The Righteous judge had the book and when he had the book and then the the the voice was transferred to John come on somebody The Voice the Thunder is the voice of God when that voice come and said John come and see and watch and I saw that's a very short part but that's very profound and I saw when I had a revelation of where that sucker was at right amen he had to ride away from me because there stood the justif fire right there in the Pulpit that night brother R said here stands a lamb does John not type the bride John tyed the bride right here too and I saw can we change that just a little bit and when I believe when I got revelation behold a white horse what another Spirit right that's right another Spirit remember remember there's no iniquity in God Satan had iniquity in him so there's no iniquity in God so if you say iniquity you know where it's at right and if you're so full of God Satan's got to leave you right that's what we've got to work on when we get to the seals coming up in just just a little while when we get in Pastor zza Street and get into where brother Brandon brings his message we're going to see that he was standing there now you're going to swallow a minute brother randam stood there that night Justified before God or he wouldn't have said here stands the Lamb with a book in his hand right amen and there goes a white horse rider the mystery of iniquity was it was still in him oh don't get quiet right Amen brother R said he said before he preached it he said I'd have made a horrible mistake I would have preached my old notes which made that guy right there the the Holy Ghost and that would have been law because he was a prophet right everybody with me he said I have made a horrible mistake so what was going away from him false Doctrine or iniquity and there was the mystery that is in me and you until we see it right away from us we've got to see that thing leave us and not come back Hallelujah we got to see it leave we got to see what joy peace come in we got to see virtue knowledge Temperance come in and you know to replace that something's got to leave that's right in the Book of Luke it says what the unclean Spirit goes out brings seven more back it makes you worse if you don't fill it with something so the devil is not just going to leave and say sorry to interrupt your program I I'm not ever coming back no no no he's going to get smarter he's going to get more more um hidden cuz he was hiding he hides himself in Doctrine that's right he hides himself in Doctrine and then what you and I do is when we take that and accept that Doctrine we become that Doctrine and if it's false we become the devil there's nothing false in God we'll get to that in just a minute I let I want you to see something if we don't we'll get to it Sunday so when the lamb opened one of the seals now here's the lamb here's the judge here's the righteous one the justifier was standing there but remember we're going to get into something you might agree with me but it's something I saw today that I want to include in this but let's get through through this and just remember what I just said Satan is somewhere all the time if you're born again he can't be in your soul but he can be in your spirit realm bombarding you every day pray for me if if if he doesn't you I'm going to send you some of mine but he what did one of the four be said it says John come and what no come and understand yeah he saw what was riding off but he didn't understand what that was the bride now has an understanding of the mystery of iniquity of what that was it took a prophet to say no that's not the Holy Ghost that's Satan right that was a mystery there that was locked up from the foundation of the world many people have preached this different like brother R did the mighty conquer and all the different things but a white horse there was a there was a Doctrine went out and it was false and what did it do it Anointed The People CU we're going to get into this in just a little bit about isusa Street I've been reading today I'm going to read some more ausa Street brother Brown said the Holy Ghost himself came on the day of ausa Street amen no mess of the age I started on it last Sunday or last week right no mess of the age said the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness fullness of the baptism and they were slain in the power of the spirit for 10 to 15 years they had church service three days continuous so much so the neighbors got mad and called the police and I think one of the policemen got converted when he went to talk to them you see how the power of God was during that time but remember remember here's my point they were trinitarians so that part of them was false amen amen that's the mystery of iniquity that had to be broke in the end time to show all those locin that were back in the in those ages that yeah they had truth Luther had truth Wesley had truth Pentecostals had truth they had the Holy Ghost come himself in in param and and daddy Seymour and all those different ones and and even in sisters right sorry about that and I know you saywell got to go by history there was one lady she was uh she was the one that got um daddy Seymour started it was through a sister but you get quiet on me that's okay I know women ain't supposed to preach and the Bible says they ain't supposed to preach that's why brother random hammered on it so much cuz they got away from that they got into the emotional part and that's why he had to bring them back back to Center well he brought some back some stayed out there all right but God can use a holy ghost filed sister that's why you sisters come and pray with other sisters right you're bringing your Holy Ghost you're not just bringing your femininity you're bringing your Holy Ghost that's connected to your femininity that can what that's brother R said what did that sister do that sister was a mother the sister had a baby that was sick she was a mother she could what sympathize and connect her Holy Ghost with her and brother R didn't have to touch up baby the Bible says lay hands on the sick and shall recover it doesn't say ministers lay hands on the sick I ain't preaching something false here sisters have the Holy Ghost and if they do they've got power they've got a position but they have power in the Holy Ghost right don't get scared it's all right you sisters have the Holy Ghost don't you it can't be it can't be different than mine and your and the and the brothers it just has a position though you're it's in a female body so that female body that fell way back over y had to come under a law or had to come under what headship but that's what the bride is she has to come under headship each one of us are feminist in the body of Christ but we have a holy ghost that powers every one of us if you let it out amen as I said before let it work brother I've never said a word about when a sister stand up and speak in tongues that's part of the body but he told him he said Just Don't Preach sisters you got your own what position but he didn't he didn't ever never blasted one sister for standing up and prophesying and one standing up and giving interpretation right he said Just Don't Preach he didn't say no you don't supposed to do that he said no you not supposed to preach and we know why because of the position that was in the come from the garden cuz listen when we get into heaven you sisters are going to have just as much power listen your body's got to be changed just like our men's body got to be changed hello that's right think about that but we see that there was a false Ministry loosed but where did it come out of it come out of what John saw what was loosed when that seal was open that was something in there that was false that had to go all right so God is beginning to justify his bride amen he's beginning to justify not his church his bride that's right amen so let's look here just a second we already talked about the line Ministry listen to this brother R was praying he said forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespassed against us and freely from our heart can you do this can you do that I asked them up at brother Richard's church and only a couple people raised their hand can you really pray for your enemies when somebody despitefully uses you you get on your knees and pray for their soul Jesus said you're to get in the Kingdom you got to be able to do that Hallelujah and freely from our heart listen this is not brother brandom adding these words cuz you could have just said him from our heart but watch it changes the whole thing freely from your heart oh I forgive them because brother Bob preached Sunday and I'm supposed to forgive him because he said to ain't got nothing to do with it you're going to have coals heat back on your head amen you got to freely from your heart from your soul we forgive everyone who has trusted passed against us look that our sins may be blotted out think of that you praying for somebody that spitefully uses you gets your sins forgiven you know the Bible tells us that if you come up in here have prayer and you get healed that even your sins are forgiven amen even your that's Bible I don't have I don't need a quote that's Bible the Bible says you come right praying and believing that if you get healed your sins are going to be forgiven amen amen oh my what a mighty God we serve what let's open the book so we can read this thing sometime that our sins may be blotted out take our iniquity and bury it in the sea of forgetfulness of thy blood Hallelujah second Thessalonians let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they come a falling away first we're seeing that now and that man of sin right be revealed or made known the son of predition look who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called God now listen Satan didn't get Eve to doubt there was a god right Satan didn't get to either doubt what God said he interpreted it to her so she' take it a different way from the pull pit from the pull pit who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God and until that white horse rider rode off that's what was bound up in that seal right there was a Ministry loosed it was a false one but it came out of the truth that's right it had that you got to have truth first right you can't have false first false is what false is the opposite of Tru so true has to be here first you and I should walk in the truth that way we don't have to walk in the Falls remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things Paul blasted this thing his whole sermon everything the things I would not I do we' have a righteous judge remember all these things I'm telling you they're going to come in there Grievous wolves they're going to come in and and Lead silly women away this whole thing Paul's telling them he said now remember I told you these things and now you know what withhold that he might be revealed in his time he was revealed in this time right here yes sir we know where Satan's seat is they didn't know where Satan's seat was oh they thought it was in the barrooms or the prostitute places or or people that didn't come to church no it's in church amen hello amen and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work Paul in the first church age only he who now lth will let who brother Brown said he God he's going to let this happen until he the bride he said brother Brown said be taken out of the way and then listen when the Gentile door is shut when he goes to the Jews Satan is going to be on his throne in the Gentile Kingdom and the Jewish Kingdom that's not the 144,000 he's going to rule the whole world folks folks he not going to be well now the whole nation of Jews no it ain't going to be the whole nation of Jews only 144,000 and2 are going to not be deceived everybody else is going to be deceived right and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming what are we looking at right now this is the coming of the Lord this is it we are the coming of the Lord that's why that he'll be destroyed by the bride one day in the Gentile Church age through who through his bride so iniquity means unrighteousness are the condition of without law either because you're ignorant of it or because you violate it brother R said in in Kentucky terms he said iniquity is knowing to do better and you go and do it anyway or knowing you should do it and you don't do it you see we fall in iniquity if we say well we don't have to go to church right somebody say amen amen we fall into iniquity there's a demon that causes you to keep him going from going to church and where is it it's not in the preacher it's not the song leader it's not the guy that's supposed to be sitting beside of you in the Pew is in you so either because you're ignorant of it because you're violating it in other words you know to do better and you do it anyway all right so now watch here's the part I want you to if we get to nothing else we'll slow down right here okay this is what the uh what the Lord kind of backed me up on the show I didn't preach this at Brother Richard they just saw this afternoon so who is the son of man the son of man is God in human flesh living among humans all right now y'all quit looking up there stop that business but so the son of man is God and human flesh and I think y'all had the um the question at the last ministers meeting about was God was was Jesus all God or whatever happened to the body or you know let's just stop the confusion I come into this world the way you're looking at me now of course I wouldn't but about that big from an act between my mother my father that had natural sperm and natural egg everybody with me that's a called a sex act sorry but that's how we all come everybody come the same way I don't care if it's in vitro or whatever had to take this to put this right here all right so now what happened with Mary even brother random had to tell us because most denominations believe that Mary dropped an egg and God just produced a sperm and or germ let's say that and put it in right but brother R said no no no he said see what you would have God doing right see these are all these great Mysteries that that to me it pieces all the puzzle together it pieces the puzzle together makes it so clear that Mary says be it unto me according to Thy word God created a germ so who did that germ come from did it come from a human man huh did it come from Joseph just like your daddy and your mama even with Mary he made it so Supernatural till he produced the egg also right amen so that body whether you believe it or not was God Amen it was a human it had a human it had human characteristics yes sir I just folks I just believe in the Garden of Eden God had something in there that was his theophany that he talked to Adam and Eve with he can't change from that he came down here to put Flesh on to die for me and you that's got Flesh on us amen brother amen that's what he did but he didn't come through an act he come from what spoken word creation yes so yes the body was human the body got old amen but it came from God right and it was the possession of God because what did he do on the day of the Resurrection he didn't go get him another one he thought so much of that one he went and picked it up as bad as it was it been beat to a pulp and when that when that when that body stepped up out of that grave he didn't look like dog meat then no no no he might have still had the scars he might have still had the theci side but he didn't look like he'd been mutilated and run through a grinder it changed that body so the son of man lived among humans amen he's the true Superman and you want to look for a Superman he's the true Superman he came from another world to This World by an act of faith not conception between a man a man and a woman right he spoke it it happened yes it went through the law of planting a seed yes he went through the law that it had to come out of the womb it had it all that had for do was for me and you though right he had to be our brother so the son of man is our brother amen right now the Son of God is a tad bit different because now he's living in humans when he was the son of man he wasn't living in humans you with me he was living among humans saving those people knowing he could get back in them to save them but now here's my point let's see if you can you all amen and let's see if you amen this so the son of man now watch him in the Bible he's not very nice oh come on people you read your Bible don't you amen he said I didn't come to bring peace amen but a sword he said I'm going to make mother against father or mother against daughter father against son who is my family didn't even call his mother mother called a woman beat a bunch of people out of a church one time sat there and went all right when I get done this and I tie it down at the end y'all going to get a beating amen that was the son of man now we know the Son of God was inside there but look at the dispensation watch how we're going to change in that dispensation in just a few minutes everybody with me all right so the son of man sure he said father only thing he ever said really positive was was father forgive them they don't know what they're doing he was always calling them snakes vipers prostitutes nobody got saved under his ministry not while he was here Brothers nobody oh the thief on the cross got eternal life for his testimony but that wasn't a new birth that wasn't his children there was no children born until Jesus left because that's where that comes from living in humans he had to leave I've got to go away he said but I'm going to send you what I'm going to send I'm going to send you your sword I'm going to send you a comforter amen hallelujah I'm going to put this thing I'm going to put this thing back together in human beings I'm not going to do it by myself though I'm God Almighty I'm going to do it through human beings I'm going to live in them so now the son of man is supposed to come back in the end time let's see if you amen this so we're talking about in the church ages he was a the Son of God all right real quick slow down he was the son of God now remember brother R said that son of man on Earth Son of God through the church ages what God living in human people showing an extending Grace amen that's right through people right yeah listen why didn't Paul why didn't Paul on the road to Damascus if everybody once talked about this seed laying in somebody and being dormant and all whatever that it's just not not true when are we going to talking to somebody yesterday when are we going to get to re start realizing that brother brandham said a lot of things that men take wrong amen come on that's right every false Doctrine in this message didn't come from John J Lake been or John G Lake right didn't come from Billy Graham it came from what brother randam said that's why he said Rapture and Faith lays in not on Rapture and Faith lays in those books and tapes you got to have a revelation how are you going to have a revelation when Jesus stood there and said you got to eat my body before you can get to heaven thank you Jesus didn't he stand and say that listen that's a direct quote from God himself right from an eternal word that you can't change amen so when are we going to start getting the Revelation behind what the prophet of God said I've always told you it's the Ence of this message is going to change us not The Written Letter Paul said the letter kth the letter is going to kill us if we keep reading it where you can get a polygamy come on somebody where do you think that Doctrine came from right uh two Souls seven Thunders amen perusia no Holy Ghost until you get way up y where'd that come from off the books and tapes amen and you can find a d direct quote that's what me and brother was talking about like Brother D always said he said you give me a quote he said a few minutes later I'll find you one that looks like I said look like it contradicted each other that's why these people are leaving the message they ain't got any holy ghost at all amen they just have an anointing that can't put the three or four quotes together amen we've had a Ministry in this church that puts the quotes together and gives it [Applause] Clarity and that's what we're living off of the body word of the son of man as brother R tells us not a man's idea so now if the son of man lived among humans and he was God he was God in Body Spirit and soul everybody agree with me Body Spirit and soul he didn't have another body from a man and a woman he didn't have another Spirit from somebody else like we have a spiritual part of us that was brought on To Us by our parents grandparents hello you know what brother BR said right if I walk like this and my grandpa walked like this you know through your DNA well God didn't have a DNA he's his own DNA that's why he's having to change us from the inside out and I'm going to say this real real slow he can't change us from the outside in that's right that's right right it's his law amen it's his law as you came the way you're supposed to come now really you didn't but you came the way God saw you were supposed to come we were supposed to come spoken word children that's why we're heading back to that son of man where God's going to start living among humans Amen in you that's the transforming power of God I'm not I'm not here to tell you that talking Brother Richard Wilson we were talking about this and he said and it's true we're God Amen but don't get confused with us being the Big G right remember what Brother D don't don't get us confused with being the Big G right he made us Little G's but the only way we can be a little G is to be connected to the Big G amen and then the way he sees it is no different they're together because that's what we came from that's the source of that fountain that comes in but listen here's my point did the son of man ever make a mistake in his Doctrine when Jesus was on Earth he never said I didn't really mean to say that strike that from the record everything you said Brother John was perfect and eternal correct them amen think about it everything he said his Doctrine was always correct Hallelujah but now he knew though coming and living in human beings there was a filter he had to go through everybody with me are you understanding what I'm saying this is way you were going to understand why Luther could be a trinitarian and still have the Holy Ghost right that was a little something in my mind I couldn't really get straightened out I can now cuz the son of man can't make a mistake he's an individual person the only the only reason we're going we're going to be that cuz he said we were he said we were it didn't come through another preacher he said right that we'd be the son of man in the end time and brother Bram just made it plain Luke 17:30 all the one all the scriptures when the son of man's been what revealed where's it going to be revealed in Jesus is not coming back to the Earth his feet is not going to touch this Earth till the Millennium who's he going to work through human beings that he's anointed and Justified that's right that's where I'm getting to Justified where the just and the justifier is the same person but you can't have false Doctrine and claim the son of man Ministry in the end time that's right amen not one word Brother Richard said he said one word got him out one word off of them get us back in but you can live under the Son of God Ministry living in humans God knew he has to go through a filter though he's got to go through the memory reason conscious effect and Imagination to get to your soul right and you can let a demon get on you now listen son of man another thing let me back up a minute did a son of man ever have to say I need to get rid of that I got a demon on me did he ever say that no but every demon that came against him or came up to him they said we know who you are we know who you are we've seen you back in we've seen come on somebody we've seen you already they were so spiritual they could see past that flesh right that the Pharisees couldn't see past his flesh they thought he was wrong they thought everything you did was wrong amen but you can't make the son of man do something wrong right right exactly he was just he was just in what he said amen and if we're claiming the son of man Ministries back in the end time we got to be that very same thing we got to be a different group of people living among human beings who are dirty right and filthy but be as righteous as God is why do you think people under the Son of God Ministry has to pass away they have to die I I'm sorry they don't have enough word to change their body don't get quiet on me the only thing that took Jesus to death wasn't his false Doctrine it was me and you with our false Doctrine amen my false Doctrine started when my Mom and Daddy got together born in sin shap in iniquity brother Brown said you were trapped into it that's right right am we'll get into that a little bit more but I want you to realize if we're claiming if we're shouting that the son of man Ministry is here it's got to be a ministry that's not wrong he's got a Ministry that is above and beyond human beings amen come on yes this listen the Son of God is eternal so don't don't claim that Luther didn't make it Luther made it Luther is just as Eternal as you are but he had some false ideas that God couldn't that's right remember the Holy Ghost brother R said is the most timid person yeah amen any little something and and I know that's not ever happened to any of y'all pray for me then yeah because we have a filter he knew we were born in sin shapen in iniquity he knew we'd have problems he saw us already have those problems right but he made a way to get out of of it but in the end time we got to step it up a little higher remember look look right here real quick we receive the Holy Ghost right here to New Birth everybody say Amen baby b newborn what baby in Christ am I'm leaning down so you can see this not something wrong with my back now this holy spirit is not different from this one but it is amen this one right here has all these virtues sealed in this one down here does not but it's the same Holy Ghost it's just working in a different capacity now all right is everybody with me brother R said Son of God through seven Church ages amen who's that that's not some Son of God right I know it's hard for some of you young ones to believe to see this but that's not the Son of God that's the son of man The Headstone is the son of man Ministry in the end time that has to cap off a group of people that have come here to he right I'm going to drop it right there are y'all feeling good are y'all feeling good listen I love being your pastor I just kind of got that Revelation about a week ago then then I lost it yesterday and then no I'm just kidding Paul now I'm not making myself Paul there's no way I am not a church AG messenger all right you would think Paul would have this group of people that was just I mean when they walked in there Angels fluttering in the building I can feel the brush of angels wings I see glory on his face Paul walks into the Church of the Corinthians and this is what he tells them everybody with me know you're not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolators this is not Petty thieves it's some hard stuff nor adulterers nor feminite nor abusers of thems with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards have I hit anybody yet nor revilers this Paul's preaching to this group of people he's in a Corinthian Church preaching to his best of the best nor thieves nor covets nor drunk nor revilers nor starers shall enter the kingdom of God let's stand and sing a song be dismissed none of us made it and such were some of you but ye are washed you are Sanctified look but ye are Justified oh wa something happened something happened with all that up there at the top somebody come to a realization that the real them didn't do it now they might have not have come to it there but remember this is for us but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man d draw back now watch If any man draw back if you can't believe that you're just as righteous as God is if you can't believe that God can't clean you up if any man draw back from this Revelation my soul shall have no pleasure in him you won't get the new birth that's right there's therefore now what no condemnation amen that's right but we get condemned every day but where do we get condemned from brother Danny we get condemn from that guy right here stop condemning yourself if you're a child of God stop it but we are not of them oh he separated us somewhere but you are not of them who draw back under predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul amen oh amen man now do you believe this I said this the other day do you believe this now miam and them looking back brother R said this on 1955 water from the Rock and saw that separation annihilated from their enemies forever how long how long was they going to be safe for these Egyptians that you see today now let me say um kind of a panoramic Here Comes Israel across now this is pretty Dawning because the Red Sea is like you know 75 or 80 ft deep are everybody with me so there's a wall of water that's 80 feet high on both sides of you and you're looking at it and God overnight has dried you up a path because how many of y'all have walked into a into a lake mud goes up through your toes and it's pretty muddy anyway even when the water goes away it takes a long time God blew that thing off so much till it was nothing but like hard pavement amen right their wheels didn't sink in the mud he just said come on you're my chosen people so they go through that thing and they're all going through and they're I'm sure there's some Dayan and coras in there the unbelievers but they turn around and look and there are the things still open and here comes the Egyptian here comes all them demons that you thought you had got rid of right I mean chariots racing as fast as they can race I like watching that movie Ten Commandments I mean here they come man they're going to destroy them because here's couple million people up on a bank brother Danny and they're standing there and they're watching and here they come they're getting closer and closer God's not doing nothing nothing closer and closer and closer and closer then all of a sudden Moses just takes his ride and right before he sticks it in the gra into water he turns around and he says these Egyptians you see today these sins you see today you'll never see them again amen and I think he put forever justif chopped off their past sins got rid of their enemy not one there wasn't one that drug yourself up on the on the other side there was not one of your sins if you make sure that you put it in that sea that you know you've been Justified there's not one going to come crawling up a couple days later they didn't reform the Army on this side no it destroyed them it destroyed them they didn't come this way anymore so what did the children of Israel do they turned and walked for 40 years in sanctification to get rid of the old fighters to get rid of the old part of them that had what disbelieved the whole time brother Ram said look these Egyptians you see today you'll see no more forever amen put them in the sea of forgetfulness and remember them no more that's what kind of God we have not goes and digs it up again and holds it against you I forgot about it so justification is your Red Sea experience sanctification is that 40-year journey to get rid of all the what all the demons and then the Holy Ghost takes you into the promised land pretty pretty simple standing in the Gap brother Ram said look today he's the only mediator between God and man and we're freely pardoned and forgiven God don't even know we ever sinned when we going to start believing a prophet amen our sins were put in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more we cannot do that ourself we are finite we're sitting here today knowing we are finite people we remember if we don't remember the sin devil makees sure we do but look he is infinite and our finite we can still remember because we're not big enough I like what he say we're not big enough but he is so great that he even forgets we ever did Sin we are sons and daughters in his presence all things that he was we are he become my sin that I might become his righteousness he became your sin that you might become his righteousness so God cannot see no sin in you as long as your confession is in Christ Jesus amen remember what brother R told him he said don't come up here in the prayer line and have sin in your life what he tell them to do now you go back and two days later you just make sure you you pray for you know 24 hours straight he said no he said you bow your head and you for ask for God to forgive you your sins he said he'll put it under the blood and I won't be able to see it and he won't be able to sit it amen wow what a mighty God we serve Satan has made our sins so huge till he's got us bound we got to loose oursel from that but we got to do it through the justifier let him tell us let listen remember is he not our Advocate amen we'll get into that when we talk about the Holy Ghost he's your Advocate what does your Advocate do it speaks for you amen let him speak for you Satan comes at you read what God's already wrote amen not only is our sins forgiven but they are buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more for they are gone they're out of the eyes of God they're paralyzed they're divorced they're put away God don't remember them no more the church ought to Rejoice this morning to know that our sins will no more be remembered they are put in the sea of forgetfulness into the grave of Beyond any Resurrection oh let me ask you a question if we are under the son of man Ministry did he have any sin I'm going to cover that again did he have any sin huh he didn't have any sin son of man never sinned that's right now listen it doesn't mean that he didn't have a bad thought though you said no I don't he called Herod an old Fox he made a few comments that were you know he he actually was thinking as a human he had to be human folks but there was something inside of him that we supposed to have in us today that takes care of that he decided this we didn't and if he decided it to work this way guess what it will work this way he'll find somebody that will live by faith and nothing else they are dead forever forgotten about they are as if they had never happened you want me to prove that Revelation 6 ver9 and we'll close this is the greatest this is the fifth seal now brother brandom when he was when he was studying this if you'll look in the first part of the of the um um six the fifth seal sermon he said this is beyond what I thought do remember he thought these were Souls under the altar come on brother Brown thought that those were the souls under the altar Saints under the altar right what the Holy Spirit tell him cuz remember the son of man had to be prevalent during that whole week that's why he said I've never worked in this realm like this before he seen the Son of God heal raise the dead tell people where they live but never has he seen something come on the scene so much and tear everything he thought was right amen tore it apart and said this is it why do you get over to different places like thank God for the opening of the seals we got marriage and divorce thank God for the open of the seals serpent SE thank God for the open of the seals all these things he went right back to the open of the seals why he'd read them a thousand times and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain now look Souls all right these Souls were put in a place of them that were slain for the word of God for the testimony which they held now we know who this is this is the fifth seal Jew the martyred Jews that didn't even like Jesus at all never testified about him never said he was their savior hello they were Jews they got killed in the slaughter just because they were Jews and they CED with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true dust thou not judge see they knew he had to be a righteous judge and avenge our blood so right there the Holy Spirit should come on Brother brandham come on Prophet that's not that's not a Believer that's not a born- again believer cuz they would be saying have mercy he said avenge our blood on him that dwell on the earth Hallelujah and white robes were given They didn't accept it they didn't even want it come on they were just six million Jews that died because they were Jews Hitler loosed that 200,000,000 demons out of the river Euphrates on to that group of people and killed him and God being a righteous judge knew what he was doing you know why I'll read it to you in just a second and white robes were given unto every one of them it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants what the 144,000 that's living right now should be killed as they were should be fulfilled amen now they didn't want it but God give it to them right right now we can't pull that cuz we're not Jews sir this is why Romans 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery Paul's telling us this is a mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become come in all right if if God didn't if God didn't see hear me real real hear me out he saw a gentile bride that wanted him more than Israel did right come on he never took that Daniel 70 weeks and pulled it apart and literally blinded his own people so that you and me can come in but being a righteous judge he had to give him eternal life cuz he blinded him so when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in guess what he's going to lift his hand off of their eyes they're going to see who first thing immediately they're going to see the Messiah right through two prophets right verse 26 and so all Israel shall be saved that it is written they shall come out out of Zion to deliver and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob listen to this sixfold purpose and we musicians come on we'll finish rest of this later on there's more of this when brother Brown comes with the invisible union he he one month from being killed in a car wreck he preaches in streetport Louisiana on Thanksgiving day he says this is my Thanksgiving Day message to you that you're The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ you didn't do it you didn't do it in the first place you were trapped into it watch this that's where they done it he was making the end of sin for them who the Jews how could he do anything else but forgive them knowing he had to Blind their eyes so that we could come in it's like his own children calling for his blood remember they said let his blood be on us and our children that's the reason he cried for forgiveness for them Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they were blind for our sake they were made blind so God had to be just the greatest gift of justification when you were out and sin did you want God to forgive you of your sins you didn't care I just tell you right now you didn't care there was nothing good in any of us for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but thank God God had a mind and in his mind he had a vision but when God ever thinks of something in his mind Brother Gary it's got to come to pass when he saw that a gentile bride was going to love him more than Israel he had to pull that 70 weeks apart slap a gentile bride in in there that would love him and cherish him and be his mate but he's not going to forget Israel though because he's going to come right back and save that group over here and he's going to save this fifth sealed Jew that didn't they listen when they died they were looking for a messiah come on they were looking for a messiah they didn't know he was already here and had already left everybody with me they're buried in the sea of forgetfulness let's stand think of a sea of forgetfulness God cannot remember them no more because they were both dead and buried it cannot even be remembered no more they're out of God's memory amen now here I'm going to read you this real quick look up the word brother Brown said this is invisible Union the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're forgiven for instance you heard I got drunk and done some evil thing and everything and you come around and say to me you found out I didn't do them are you going to say brother R I forgive you for that forgive me for what I didn't do it in the first place brother R I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it at the first place now if I did it I'm guilty am I with me but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually did it but the word Justified is though you've never done it listen that's the Revelation revealed under the seals that's the whole revelation of underneath that seal is to show us that right there it's not even regarded at all in God's book of SE of forgetfulness your old book in marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God so why why do we let stuff beat us up for because the devil has one foothold on us and that's our mind up here not our heart he has right here he can play greatest battle ever fought all right remember it's not down here if you're born again it's up here amen you are Justified therefore being Justified it was accused you were accused You' never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of forgetfulness now remember the old Union there was an old Union you were born and S but you got to realize as brother R says right here you were trapped into it you never send it the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and dead absolutely how when we going to start believing what brother B said he's quoting the Bible to us those he's Justified he's already glorified now if you try to justify yourself you'll never get to that but he who is he has Justified he's already glorified you're standing there watching your old book of divorcement is put away dead absolutely AB resistance even in the mind of God The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word let me give you a little secret that's not in another dimension that's going to happen right here in this Dimension it's going to be real easy to think that maybe we can pass on and we get a glorified body and we in heaven he's talking about right now that's his that's his Thanksgiving message to us that it's going to happen right now not that it's going to be somewhere else or I'll just wait what you waiting on that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love stop right here this will be it Paul comes to the end of his Journey he went through the things I would I shouldn't I've done this I've persecuted the Christians I don't feel righteous I don't this I don't that he comes down to the end of his life he said look whatever's happened I fought a good fight I finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me me Paul Paul was pretty positive he said not for my congregation for me he come to a revelation that he was going to get a crown amen a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day now watch Paul could have just went off the scene and that would have been it nope he included me and you and not to me only but unto all them that also that love his appearing amen have we seen his appearing yeah he's appeared in many forms but he's come to dwell in a group of people that are The Virtuous sinless pride of Jesus Christ let's sing a song God bless you hallelujah oh ye Saints of light Proclaim Jesus light of the world live and mercy in his name Jesus light the world sing it to him now who's supposed to be the light you are the [Music] lighta come theups of Mercy shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the [Music] world is Jesus the world how's he going to send it through me and you send the you need to get somebody in the light beautiful light come where the D Drops of Mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world why not seek oh thank God for what he's done for us we couldn't do this we couldn't get ourself out of any of this we just make a big mess of it but when give it to him and let him do it Jesus the light of the world we walk in the light beautiful light come where the D of Mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus light of the world let's come confess him as your King Jesus the light of of the world then the Bell of Heaven Will Rain oh my when you see him it'll do something for you we walk in the light beautiful light come where the drops of Mercy are shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world I hope you understand what I'm trying to say it's not two or three different Holy Ghost it's not two or three different jesuses that mystery of iniquity is brother B was preaching not too long ago when you see that first Hill open you see one God cuz when you see one God there's no other God before me there's no other God behind me there's no other God riding on that horse he's right there that's where he is God's in his people not in three different people sure it's a manifestation of the Holy ghost but it's as brother R said it was a dip Luther had a dip of the Holy Ghost now not a different one it was the same water in the ocean just a small dip Wesley got a little bit bigger dip to be Sanctified the isua street Pentecost they got a pretty big ladle for cuz they had to go all over the world but it denominated and died amen but you and I you and I don't take a dip that's right we're the ocean amen we're the ocean we're the ocean from when all that came from God saved the best for last we'll make it we're going to get it done and we're going to get it done together we ought to know where we are and who we are and what we're doing here that's a revelation cuz when you see that then see whatever you got harboring inside of you that mystery that iniquity is going to take off that's what's going to drive the unclean Spirit listen Satan can't cast out Satan so Satan can't come and say get over Damon I'm I'm here now no they just both go to work on you but when God walks in the door somebody's got to move somebody's got to leave amen you love the Lord God bless you thank you for coming out on the Wednesday night we sure appreciate you um let's bow our heads and pray we'll have regular service on Sunday and then looking forward to uh to the week coming up after that dear heavenly father thank you Lord for all the things you've give us thank you for a group of people Lord that are here Lord not because Lord they want to be seen or heard or or look at me
