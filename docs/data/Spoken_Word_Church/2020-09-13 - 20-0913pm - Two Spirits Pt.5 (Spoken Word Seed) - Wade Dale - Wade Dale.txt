let's just start with the chorus the original light the original scene the original word it's what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original the original sea god's attributes were manifested to his pride in this last age we have caught the revelation by last prophet's message and we know who we are and what we raised up for praise the lord for the original life the original life the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original life the original seed we the word made flesh today this is what the scriptures say and our names are seen within redeemed and perfect without sin yes we are anointed and inspired by our god who's the original light the original life the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original life the original sea our eyes of understanding he has opened up at last and sweet victory is ours who were chained down in the past true jubilee has sounded and we have responded to our god who's the original like the original light the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed a seventh seal is unveiled the original line the original seed we are called onto adoption we are called on to adoption full authority and power sleeping saints will wake and join us for translation in this hour gentiles days will soon be over glory hallelujah to our god who's the original lot the original life the original seed the original word the is of man is revealed the seven seal isn't with the original life the original seed as brother white comes the original life the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unbearable [Music] all the way back from the beginning but now it's not there anymore i'm not on i thought i turned that thing on when i started no it does now right thank you it's more for them all y'all up here in the front gets the blessing of my loud voice anyway so the ones in the back maybe are not but uh that's okay yeah i know good to be in the house with lord good to see everybody downstairs was full this morning i don't know about this afternoon but uh good to be back here gonna take communion today and we'll discuss that at the end because if i tell you now you'll forget so we'll talk about it before we get ready to leave if you got your bibles let's turn to first john where we were before the last few times we're still talking about two spirits today we're going to speak on the spoken word seed spoken word seed everything originated from the spoken word everything even lucifer originated from the spoken seed word amen because what is a seed the word of god according to the book of mark sower went out to sow and the word was the seed but we'll get into where god had to split that thing though and bring natural seed in okay because he had to bring natural seed everything was spoken by the original seed didn't need another seed it had to originate somewhere there was first a seed of something that originated from the mouth of god it didn't originate from anywhere else if he's the creator he created every seed that ever was and ever will be on the face of the earth all right so now remember that today after the second service we'll be taking communion and remember brother louise will be speaking wednesday night so good good to be in the house of lord good to see everybody it's just a refreshing time you know i i don't see how you can miss church when the doors are open it's just a fire in your heart that it burns and it's just part of what you are it's that seed the word talking to the word amen first john four verse one talking about two spirits this is part five spoken word seed we'll try to get down into remember we were before we spoke on before the beginning now we're down here to where we see let there be and and i i enjoyed wednesday night if you didn't if you didn't hear wings do not service you ought to hear it ma'am because it really gives you a uh a little more perspective of what light is that we don't need the sun anymore once we get over into the future home we don't need it anymore so it's and it's not temporary it's going to be there but we won't need it we won't need to wait till in the morning till the sun comes up for us to get like no light's always going to be in that city that city will be illuminated for millions and hundreds of thousands of you if you if we go off to another planet brothers act we go off to the milky way and we can look back we'll still see that city hey ma'am if we can travel like a thought we ought to be able to amen we'll be able to observe that what is that light that light comes from me and you jesus told the people said you're the light of the world ye are the light of the world because when we leave this place the only light that's going to be in the world is going to be a little small dot of 144 000. why did brother branham draw the the the angel draw the chart and it showed the white and the black in each church age the white being what light and the darkness being the black all right so the angel was telling brother branham you're right on i mean when an angel comes by and draws the same thing you've been preaching on the wall pretty good confirmation to me but the most confirmation is is you can see it in the word if you can see it in the word you know that that that could be done and it could be imitated but you can't imitate it connecting with the word that's why i believe that light was so great back in the beginning that it's just to me that's illumination that's revelation that's a light that goes on your goes off in your brain or in your soul when when god brings a revelation to you because we love revelation we're revelation people so as we get revelation to me that's more of the spark that we need to get through life amen so let's bow our heads before we get started pray for each other pray for these ones um like i said we spoke to brother jason jackson yesterday or text your brother jason he he has the virus and a good many people in his church so we want to remember them especially sister sheila mccommons now some of you may know brother frank a commons he's from uh out there and um a real good brother his sister i mean his wife has real she's had problems with her lungs before this happens so now she has coveted and she's having a hard time so let's just pray for sister sheila as we go through the service just keep these in your prayer you know pray all the time pray without ceasing it just just continue to i i've always said before i don't know if sister jill's watching in but this little thing right here has really caused me to to pray i lost one the other day and i about died i had to go find try to find a thing i couldn't find it so june happened to have an extra one but this helps me to what i pray for sister jill first i pray for her first because she's the one that gave us these and then i start praying for the people and you should do that you should pray and you know what the lord brought to my attention the other day you know i prayed for brother ron ron who ron spencer or ron peterson or ron paul a run of this one to run that one gut said called the full name and even dutch scott is now doing he said people have mentioned to me to please call the full name of that person so that we can get a focus on praying for somebody and pray for brother ron spencer because he has coveted two and i think his wife does also and and he's battling um well he's not battling cancer i believe that's been defeated but he's just battling trying to get over everything so let's remember your prayers let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you'll anoint us for this service today lord that you'll be the active participant be the speaker lord that you be the hearer father and that the angels just clear everything back lord so that we can truly as we said get real updated revelation of what's going on in the time and the hour that we're living lord i pray that you'll be with the ones that are sick be brother jason jackson sister sheila mccombs different ones lord that we call by name lord all the time in our mind that satan has tried to he's trying to keep the bride apart because he knows if she'll get a true revelation as we're gonna read a quote here in a few minutes lord that we've been reading that if you'll get a true revelation of what's going on lord we know satan loves to divide and conquer but lord we know the greaters he that's in us than he that's in the world greater is he that's here lord as you said through your prophet you said you the word is a seed and every word of promise can be taken whole by the bride for healing for salvation for deliverance for all the things that we need it's laying right there in the word of god but if it just lays there it's no good we must put it in good ground we must water it with good water we must do the things that we need to do to get that seed to produce father i pray that everyone in the building and with the sound of our voice lord that you would help us all to grow up more in you lord to elevate our revelation lord higher and higher lord because you're standing there wanting us to give it the prophet that god said more than we're wanting it lord i pray that our want will be more and more for you father be with each one lord take care of the bride around the world bless this day in jesus name amen first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world how do we know that brother brown was a true prophet he was vindicated you can lay it everywhere in the word and right there is everything that he said all the things that he's given us is right there all right we don't have to go guest for something else or guest for somebody else even as some have said you know no no no uh who is who is this malachi 3 and who is this malachi 4 well you know the the words real clear john actually told you who he was i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness i'm not the one that's going to be here before the great and dreadful day of the lord so by the process of elimination malachi 3 is not william branham malachi 4 because he is restoring back the faith of the fathers back to the original all right and i believe and i can see that in his work that he did restore us back to the original but then he brought a message that had never been brought before a message that man knew nothing about jesus christ himself was the only person that knew anything about it and when he left he said i'm coming back so he's coming back in this end time and gave us the headstone revelation not the cornerstone revelation you've got to have the cornerstone revelation but it takes us to the headstone revelation but hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god pretty simple and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already isn't in the world that's 1896 year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of aaron you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word as we were talking uh sister um and i we're talking downstairs it's cletum talking about um different things about uh illuminati and all the different things you know that where is all that well you know what judas hung around until the day of the crucifixion he was there until jesus christ was almost put on the cross and then judas did what he was supposed to do so it's not yeah what are you saying by the way well it's not i believe there's illuminati in this message i hope you're listening now we know you're here but it's just it's two spirits it's not two people it's a spirit of truth and the spirit of error the spirit of error can hang on so long but right at the very end when you see that jesus christ this is my whole thought the seed word of god jesus christ himself is here today not sitting 2 000 years ago in an upper room he's here today and he's here today to separate the same seed that when he was sitting at the table and and they were all asking is it me is it me is it me he said the one that puts the hand in the bowl well my goodness they were all putting their hands in the bowl but judas knew who he was at that time he was being called out by the word itself and the only reason you and i are going to know the difference is the word is going to call it out amen not some human not some quote not cement you are going we are all are going to manifest what seed is in us in this end time amen we're going to have to because it's what it's harvest time it's not time to plant seed now we know there's new ones coming in and we know there's different things going on that there is a young plant growing but there is a maturity there is a time when you have to go out and harvest all that that you planted all right so god has come to a place he's going to harvest everything that he planted he's going to harvest it that's why we're looking at the spoken word seed because remember adam was a spoken word seed the world was the spoken word seed every seed that was laying in the earth was a spoken word seed all right so we're going to get to that in just a second i really enjoyed zoe that was wonderful did a good job i was as good as i've heard on the radio yeah good job get them young get them young before the devil gets them all right so let's look in ezekiel 28. i still want you to remember one thing we are not dealing with a demonic spirit like the world is talking to us about like some hideous coming up here at halloween he's going to be some gross and grotesque beautiful most deceiving age there ever is it's going to be a beautiful demon that's going to try to take our try to take our joy away from us ezekiel 28 verse 11 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of taurus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou see list up to some full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou hast been in eden the garden of god didn't bother him to walk up down the guard same garden that god walked up and down right didn't bother him he was there now has been in guard eden the garden of god every precious stone was not covering the sardius topaz diamond barrel onyx jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle and gold why that's beautiful stones the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes were prepared and then the day that thou was created so god created lucifer from a spoken word he spoke him into existence that's right amen everybody got a problem anybody got a problem with that he had to come from somewhere and if grant if god's the only originator and he's the only one that can create he created lucifer but this is how he created him though according to ezekiel and according to the other scriptures we've been reading he created him perfect he created him the anointed cherub he created him to be his right-hand man all right how many times did we read that that was where brother brown was telling us that he was his right-hand man he wasn't he wasn't some uh something created way down no he was right here all right and lucifer means light so you got to be careful this is like i said this is the most deceiving age there is that judah's spirit is here today is here what to turn us away from the word of god to keep us from listening to the word of god to keep us from doing the things that we need to do as far as being a christian because you know what satan is religious satan is deceivingly religious all right because it's a religious spirit that we're dealing with not now listen you say well brother what you're you're discounting or discluding all these other spirits no they fall under two like i said before there's god's holy spirit as brother brown said and then there's satan's unholy spirit so whatever god's holy spirit is it's eternal it's right everything's perfect there is nothing wrong with it it has healing it has salvation it has all these different things satan over here on the other hand has all the other you can put prostitution pornography perversion put all that under that but but it heads up to one spirit which is a religious spirit to begin with amen so that's the two spirits we need to look at so let's look at number one let's read this no let's look genesis 1 26 we're going to we're gonna try to get this to this man and how many times have we spoke on this and brother dale's speaking on it this morning is just you know just overlay what what we're doing this afternoon so he preached it a long time before i did a long time as uh some are realizing they listening back in the 80s brother dale's preaching on the seals that we're just we're just redoing this this we're just going back again all right listen the word of god is just going back over there's no new there's no new rabbit trail we got to go down sure we find different things and we i know brother they'll tell you one thing's for sure he's got more revelation now than he did in 1982 but it's based on what that is what was preached then it's based on what faith this whole pyramid is based on faith brother brown said this whole sermon today is based on one thing that's faith all right so we some of you may have heard this before but we want to give it a little update you know i i like to drive an old car brother donny's got some old old old model a's and multi model a's you didn't have a gps in the model a you got a map physical map so you see what we're talking about now we're updating as man has updated his revelation where we got gps's now in your phone that you got on your on your arm right there you got you got gps my goodness we needed one this big almost when we first got started but not anymore so as as satan satan can pull nothing over on god god's always used the gps god's always been wireless he's always been wi-fi what god ain't never needed a wire to plug anything in to contact you no why he speaks to you what from from him to through the airwaves right into your heart amen but see so does the devil the devil slips right in and does the same thing so we have to be careful with that so let's read genesis 1 26 this is the culmination of what we're going to get to maybe today and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image as brother dale said this morning this is what the listen to this big word i'm fixing to say this is what the multiplicity of god looks like it's right here we are the very woven genetic being if you're born again today you are woven in the image of this man right here because if he's your father i don't look like brother ray i look like my dad why because i came from that seed of genetic and we'll talk about in a few minutes about the law of reproduction every seed has to bring forth of its kind it can't bring forth anything different so then we must look like our father what adam looked like adam look like god you know like his daddy didn't he what else did he look like he didn't you know uh but i'm sure we're gonna see in just a few minutes when the natural seed split down here on the earth cain didn't look like abel why two different daddies why two different seeds physical now let's get let's stay spiritual now because the spoken word is the original seed the original condition as brother dale's talking about the beginning of the creation of god it happened to be spoken word seed not seed of man not even the seed of eve i mean mary personally she did not give see you see what that is you you you think about that if she would have given the the egg then that wouldn't have been the body of god that would have been a genetic makeup of eve coming from whatever down the line genetically [Music] no god created both egg and sperm put them together and planted them in mary by speaking the word not by a sensation by speaking the word of god and it brought forth exactly where it originated from amen you and i by the new birth yes go back to the original i was thinking that the other day you know me and josh was talking about it takes four thousand four thousand different people you know brother brown said god bred this one to this one listen what came first your humanity your human dna or the dna god saw you back before the foundations of the world listen i'm off my subject here but let's get on this one for a minute when brother rhino said god took a picture of you and put it in an album now you weren't even anything at that time it had to be the theophany hello it had to be the theophany it wasn't your flesh body it came later listen to the great designer let me tell you how good he is he took that image and he took four five six eight ten thousand people had to come together physically physical seed and and and um egg to match that image of me or you or anybody else what a mighty god when he took that picture it had to come that way brother brown said god bread this one to this one this one this one think about all the crazy way you got here and how you grandma you don't even know how your great-great-great-grandma got here why because god listen the master the master scientist knew he didn't have to look in a he didn't have to look at a microscope by the louise to see what your dna was he already put it there it was in his mind he was able to project that image of you 20 years old and then he waited for 6 000 years to get mr mr rego together to produce that image because that's what you're going to look like you're not going to look any different what you are now think about think about listen think about all the trouble god went through which god don't go through trouble but think about all the trouble that god went through just to get you here knowing that you would want it so bad until he would make what that peace match the piece has got a match you got to come in the image of your mom and daddy sure but somewhere in there if you're a son and daughter of god that image has got to match what god put in that book before the foundation of the world before michael and and satan fought before there was a world for you to stand on you know why because you're the very german nation of that person i come from god i'm going back to god okay i came from my mom and daddy though but brother brown said you got to realize that before the foundation of the world if you have new birth tonight that before the foundation of the world that eternal life always was with god well what was it you saw no that picture it's woven in his you couldn't find me in inside of daddy you couldn't find me inside but i was in my great grandpa according to the prophet of god that's right yeah not a little wiggling sperm running around in his body in genetic makeup that's why man broke into god's laboratory with genetics they can do a lot of things now they can tell you now whether you're susceptible to cancer or susceptible to diabetes what your family's history is why by dna why can't we realize that we're the dna of almighty god we had to come here a different dna but that dna has got to match what god saw before the foundation of the world but now look a sinner don't have to happen because he never saw him like that he just came on earth because of the law of reproduction and god gave him a spirit i didn't i don't say have to but he does because satan knew if he could get two people together in the garden he can make something you understand what i'm saying if he could get two people together and inject a natural seed into the god would have to give it life he had to give cain life he had to give able life because of the law of reproduction so let's let's think about that just kind of mull that around in your mind let's go to the exposition of the church ages now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his work attempt the destruction of god's people and discrediting of god's word it's what he's doing discrediting the word of god right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire remember even after even after he can't touch us for a thousand years thousand years he's bound by a chain of circumstance he's bound he can't work god lets him loose just for a little while he still thinks he can defeat us wrong answer right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church not the demonic that's going on out there listen the demonic out there is just a manifestation that that second spirit or number two spirit is an unholy spirit amen that's why they act the way they do they have an unholy spirit brother brown says even i've got the quote back there where he's talking about women putting on shorts and in bikinis and going out in the world he said it's a spirit that's on them women it's an unholy spirit that's on those women all right so now look listen everything's got a spirit to it everything everything even on one side or the other because even in the holy spirit you've got different manifestations of the holy spirit that works in your life you've got different anointings that god puts on you so satan has the same thing they're just perverted everything he's got is a perversion of what god has because he can't stand and say let there be that's right and he hates that he can't stand it she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her now remember that's a religious spirit now let's read number two the greatest battle ever fought i cut out some of these so we could get to what we're talking about here today this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels so now we realize as brother dale was talking this morning that we were going to bring forth today too that michael was not created he was the creator because why would lucifer the right hand man of god why would he want to fight with a third person or something down the line no satan wants to be like god he don't want to be like that guy he wants to be like god so he fought michael and lucifer fought and obviously satan lost all right and it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings now remember i said before not into human beings you can be demon possessed okay but you can't be the demon right everybody got that that's pretty simple you're a human being you have the authority to say no or you have the authority to say what brother brown say brother brown said that woman was healed by the time she got to the end of the platform said but the next day or whatever what she said he she loved that spirit so it just came right back to her she allowed it if she just took what brother ryan said and said don't you allow that spirit to come back fight the thing but some people like it i you know i got a sister-in-law that she just loves to be sick she'd have nothing else to complain about but you see that it's a pattern in people they just they'd rather be sick than be well why was he wowzy woo his brother jewel says i don't want to be that way and then it was thrown down from heaven the battle from angels became human battles and satan came to destroy god's creation and what god had created to be for his self he had satan came to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began on earth and begin where in us and has been raging ever since ever since the beginning of time it has been raging but god being the first the original the creator satan can't get above him he wanted satan to get beside him he did right-hand man you do this i want you to do this i want you to do this but what was found in satan was iniquity satan wanted to do more or what he was doing you know and and you know it's just like i'm sure god looked over lucifer they still talk now okay so i can just be all right by saying this he looked over and he said don't do that you shouldn't be doing that and you know what lucifer's saying i'll decide what i want to do he's not some he did not take headship that's why you and i must stay under headship we are sheep right we have to be led we have to have correction we have to be corrected and if we're not we're master children all right same way with lucifer lucifer the bible says until iniquity was found in you in your heart in other words god knew that lucifer would do what he did but he still gave him a choice he just like he did cain he said cain if you'll do well lucifer if you'll quit doing that we'll be fine but he couldn't quit he kept on going and going and what he do he kept getting further and further away from god not not not distance wise but word wise because he started creating his own word he could still stand right here beside the lord jesus and he still he can still bring a word to pass but what he has to do though is remember he has to take what this one says first original he has to take that original seed to pervert it he can't make a seed never can satan say let there be never can satan listen satan cannot get where god won't let him get amen satan will never get anywhere unless god allows him to get in to you me the garden of eden doesn't matter where right amen but what are we fighting today we're fighting spirits folks we're not fighting about i said before don't don't think that i'm talking about any person i'm not i'm talking about there's only two people we need to deal with that's lucifer and god amen or the devil or satan never how you want to say his name but it's the two spirits but remember as we begin now satan never can create amen he can't he can't be an original he can't any you say well no no sin originates from bible says sin started in heaven when michael and lucifer fought lucifer took his angels and came down here and didn't press their self into people see that's a doctrine brother brown covers that doctrine that that now they say you know there's some denominations say that those people came down remember the sons of god saw the daughters of men and started getting perverted no that was sex that was that was that was a seed that was given in human beings that wasn't the seed word of god amen it was the sons of god saw the daughters of men satan what satan perverted the beauty that god created god didn't create eve ugly brother brown said she's the most beautiful woman he said but satan knew he could use that and that's what he did so he used something that was part of the original so let's let's go the spoken word is the original seed let's go to number three all right so you want let me let me ask you a question where did the fall originate we always go back to when i even and um the beast did their thing and it was before that that was a manifestation of what had already been spoken amen and then what happened was is lucifer come down here to make that fall happen god can't make a fall happen but he allowed satan to come down here and be careful when you read the quote where brother brown said satan was the woman's designer you go to um marriage in divorce now listen satan didn't create eve god created eve created a perfect created or beautiful but satan looked at that and said i'll promise you if that ever gets to a man i can play with it i'm just like so i'm you know you just got to be like the devil sometimes you know you say well i can't play with that ugly guy over there yeah you understand what i'm saying i can't ah but that girl she's beautiful i can tempt her i can get close to her what do you think he did with the beast he didn't just walk up and say hey me and you no no they may have been years and years and years because there's an interaction between eve and the beast and adam even adam and the beast because it was the next creation close that's what we're going to talk about here in a minute that next creation that could talk right but now i don't think i i don't maybe adam did but i don't think eve knew that she could reproduce with him because she didn't know anything about reproduction remember they were naked and no problem everything was pure brother brown said a holy ghost veil was over them too all right but now remember you got to think with me here the beast was not the beast didn't have a soul the beast wasn't a human being the beast came from the seed of a beast everybody got that amen came from god but god in continuity as brother brown said in creative evolution he couldn't skip over no he had to make in creative evolution he had to make a beast he had to make a monkey and then make a beast and then make man but what he done with man is he put that soul of that genesis 1 26 man that thing that come from god because think with me here all life is precious to god but god told us that we could eat meat we ought to kill you know what you eat nothing you put nothing in your mouth that didn't die first that's right if you eat a raw goldfish it's going to die by the time it gets to your belly they still do that louise probably did a long time ago probably you just don't remember right it was those times those foggy times that you don't remember yeah but something's got to die before you can eat it so what is that life well we know listen we can get all this hui dewey about um cabbage and vegetables and it's got life but it ain't got life like a deer's got a life or a cow's got a life okay but it's life because god told him originally before the fall he said you can eat of all the herbs of the ground and the things of the tree and the nuts and the fruits and all that but then after the fall happened remember he said now you can eat meat because i think because i think god's setting up what we need i mean how we gonna i don't know if i could never be a vegetarian i just couldn't ever be a vegetarian god gave me canines so i could tear some meat with but god told us he said okay you can eat meat now you can eat this you can eat these things what is it and but it's life but it's not precious life don't get me wrong every life precious but it's not precious life that is a part of god like me and you are a part of god we have a soul we have something that listen god is obligated to his word right so god is obligated when a man and a woman comes together he's obligated to give you a soul because of the law of reproduction now remember though the beginning of the creation of god should have been that's what brother dale's talking about should have been spoken word creation but because of what happened satan what he perverted the original way of god okay so let's get into that real quick right here let's go to genesis one oh let's read this right here first sorry i think i missed the page here we go i'm sorry let's read this first because i want to get these the different seeds and then we'll go to genesis one all right number three exposition seven churches and get a little ahead of myself for there were certain men not saints crypt and unawares these have not come before by the means of the door and are therefore robbers who were there before of old ordained to the condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lascivious and denied the only lord god in our lord jesus christ these are spots in your feast when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds right now that's a spiritual planting that's not a natural planting that's a spiritual planting all right so now let's go to exposition of the church age this is a new one here i found it the other day listen to this did you get it now there are those twins again remember there was a tree of life and a tree of knowledge in the garden right there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same water rain and benefiting by the same sun but they are but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god give it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as cain did as did cain who ended up killing abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan wow that's pretty rough so now let's go to genesis 1. let's talk about the light just for a second in the beginning god created heaven and the earth the earth without forming void and darkness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light we talked about that wings tonight i hope you understand that that wasn't an artificial light either that light emanated from the almighty that light didn't have a beginning didn't have an end you can't do away with it just i said like i said before i read you that statement it says light is a form of energy when when when god said let there be light there had to something connect something had to rub together the big bang theory ever what you want to say it is but remember i'm like what brother dick always said he said i don't mind you talking about the big bang theory he said but somebody had to flip that switch to get the thing going right so it all to me it emanated from the eternal god because light is a form of energy energy can neither be created nor destroyed right so the energy of god is eternal it can only be changed from one form to another and that's what we're talking about where god that couldn't be understood that now he's now he's god because he's created angels to worship him he's created lucifer he's created all these things he's created uh gabriel all the different ones and then all he does is step over and says let there be not a different person he's changed his form he's took his energy and used it a little bit over here in this way amen same energy it emanates from the same place that all right but god saw the light what that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day in the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning with the first day now let's look at number four it is rising of the sun just read the red the first light that was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth remember that light wasn't created it was brought to the forefront it's what we were looking at here again what's the definition of light something that makes vision possible listen god always was and god always was a human now brother brown uses different things like forms of light and all god's always been a human he couldn't change from being that now he can change his form but he can't change who he is because if he stands there and says let us make man in our own image what image you well why it wasn't the image before there was darkness on the face of the earth and there was this and there was that and there was the other that brother brown says there's a halo of light listen we never came a halo of light adam never whirled around in the garden of eden no he was a man right right the first light was ever getting on earth was god spoken word what see spoken word seed the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word and he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth the creation of joy and life upon the earth now like this other definition says the sensation aroused by stimulation of the visible visual receptors when the light comes on it stimulates something in your eyes remember your pupils dilate real hard lights your pupils go down to protect your eyes and but when you got perfect light man you just oh this is great you can see everything all these led lights that was put up and all the different things you can see much better why because you ought to be able to see god's word better spiritually your eyesight should be better than it was before amen so now let's read revelations and let's prove that that light wasn't the sun because in revelation 21 when this thing is all said and done and over with and i saw no temple there and for the lord god almighty and the lamb with the temple thereof and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof there's so much to god we don't understand but i understand one thing's for sure he is light and if he's light standing doing the creating brother bob then we were inside that light and when we come out and become little messiahs and we become little gods we're not darkness if you're born again today you got a light inside of you brother ramsay you go create a world [Applause] hello create a world and go live on it inside of you why because you're part of the creator you didn't make him less a creator when you came one day and received the baptism the holy ghost no you made him greater we can do the greater works know what god decided that because god could do it he could just say okay i'm gonna you know you don't need to preach i'm just gonna no that's not what he said his word just like i was thinking why brother dale was preaching you know brother branham said that the old testament saints built the body of god now they didn't like a lego set no what was it his body was not created by man and woman his body was created by the word yes that's right and he said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child not a man not a human i mean not a man like adam not a full-grown no baby he had to come the way the word said that's what built his body when jesus walked out he walked out on all that old testament word in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god and then it came down here and become flesh it's the law of reproduction so let's go to genesis one verse six and we're gonna go we're gonna go through this pretty quick and we'll be done i got another little thought i want to bring later on i got way a bunch of way a bunch of quotes back there god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the water and let it divide the waters from the waters now this was after that he had done made the created the light you understand that everybody with me all right and god said let the water under the heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appeared it was so god called the dry land earth and gathered together the water called he sees and god saw that it was good now look this verse 11 is we're going to start right here [Music] this is the beginning of the law of reproduction all right so you put in the law of reproduction brother brown has several quotes on it but we'll not read them now to save time but now here is the law of reproduction and god said now who's standing there while god's saying this lucifer is standing right there he's not off playing somewhere he's in church so here he is standing next to the creator and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed satan said hmm something to begin with and the fruit tree yielding fruit what after his kind i didn't plant corn this year and expect potatoes to come up because i had corn seed when i planted corn seed i expect corn to come up god's the spoken seed word was perfect and original at the beginning when he said let them bring forth of their kind that's exactly what he meant now we've hybrided it man has but god don't hybrid god is original i've got many many quotes that brother brown tells us that god god's not in high breeding that's what got us in trouble to start with eve what high breeded with the beast didn't keep it original all right the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself so when god first spoke it he first spoke it when it started growing he didn't have to wait till that peach grew up and threw off a seed and it fell in the ground no he'd already set that in motion and you know guess what everybody millions of years ago that was it's still happening today i go look out in my yard and pour the little squirrels they they they probably like me and brother gary krantz they're absent-minded see i almost forgot your name so about absent as i could get but those squirrels go out there brother ray and right now there soon as the pecans fall out of the tree buddy they grab that pecan and go they push that thing down the ground now i'll eat you in a little while about january or february i they must have forgot about that drive-through restaurant right there because sister kathy what'll happen about april you'll see a shoot come up out of the ground i've got low pecan trees all over my yard why because it's the law of reproduction a pecan tree has to come from that seed if you put it in the right environment and surely they're wanting to eat it they're putting it up for food but if we have a good year and they plant so many i've got them growing mama all of us we've got we have to pull them up out of our out of our flower bed because here goes the little squirrel you know but what did he do he took that seed and put it in the right environment covered it up it went through the winter but when that life started hitting that seed it had to reproduce itself because it seemed life is in itself everybody got that same man whose seed is in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good so satan's going okay all right and god said let there be light in the firm of the heaven to divide the day from the night now he goes through and makes the two great lights so let's go skip some time go down to what's this right here verse 21 god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and ever weaned foul after his kind and god saw that it was good and god blessed them satan's standing right there god blessed them and said what be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters and the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth now we know how they reproduce because you know what their seed is inside their self mama whale and daddy whale gets together mama dolphin and daddy dolphin gets together that the animals were procreating by sex everybody got that but now he said it in motion he got the chickens here remember the eggs didn't come first the chicken came first he created mama chicken and daddy chicken but when he created mama chicken and daddy chicken mom and cheese mama chicken and daddy chicken had to fulfill what god said be fruitful and multiply under life mama and daddy chicken gets together there's a seed planted and what comes forth an egg what's in that egg another chicken boy this is simple and the evening in the morning were the fifth day but you know who's watching it though lucifer's watching every bit of this he's going i can't create them to but i see how they are doing it and i'm standing there when god told them multiply and fill the earth in the evening and morning with the fifth day and god said let the earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind now what's god doing creative evolution he's coming up out of the water and he's building cattle he's got animals on top of the earth living creatures after his kind cattle and creeping things and you know what he created the beast daddy and mama beast and god made the beast of the earth after his kind remember let's don't have an aha moment the beast has called the serpent to hide what he was before god turned him into a serpent everybody got that he was a beast he was an upright creature he was walking on the earth he was between man and monkey in flesh and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth god created them and said go multiply all right sexually between a male and a female nothing wrong with that because he's what he told them to do to bring life but satan's going remember brother brown said satan knew the knowledge of the principles of life that's the principle the law of reproduction is what listen satan worked under what god said don't you think that's what he's doing now yeah so i said about religious not all these things he's working under the umbrella of the message because god made the beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth he made them god saw that it was good and he told them to go and multiply the earth everybody got that say amen and that was between a mama and a daddy animal the the the man and the woman all right but now remember we'll get into this a little bit later that is what animal flesh now when we come to this right here it wasn't in animal flesh yet right everybody got that saying man you've been through genesis 1 26 in this church long enough you ought to know what that is that's god that's you in a multiple form that's adam that's the eternal life right there so you can't create an eternal life what i tell you many many times before when we get down to where it says god created man in his image that word is formed god is forming his own family when he said let us make man in our image you know what i believe i believe brother luis that's when he started making that picture he didn't need a polaroid no it was already in him it was a part of him see the look at the difference between me and you and god god knew how many children he was going to have because he's only got so many seed he knew what they were going to look like because he was god by foreknowledge but see you and i don't we just leave it to god but we know one thing's for sure sterling doesn't look like brother dardy why not the right seed amen but if you come to the right seat you're going to produce exactly where you came from amen that was the same way with cain and abel they produced exactly where they came from all right but let's not get to that real quick so now look and god blessed them verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image or formed man in his own image because remember as brother dale's talking about the beginning of the creation of god listen god has no beginning and god was not created so you got to take those words and know what god's saying i know what he's doing he's hiding it he's hiding it from even the devil he's hiding in your heart so that you get a revelation of what god said so god created a man in his own image the image of god created to him male and female created to them what happened was you got god's standing there you got lucifer standing here he's already fought michael so he don't have enough revelation to know that michael's standing right here he fought michael and he's the guy standing right here you know and then here's this other i'm going to say this this other thing comes out of god god start god's going i'm going to make something created in my image and i'm going to put it down here on the and satan's going lucifer's going where are you going to get it from you ever thought about that satan's going where are you because he can't create he has no thought of creation but there's the creator god's got it every bit in his mind he's got it every bit a part of him he knows what adam's gonna look like he knows where he's gonna put him satan only knows that when adam was put in human flesh brother branham said i'll bring the quotes later because we'll stop here pretty quick he said knowing the principles of life he knew that if he put adam and eve in flesh they'd fall so satan is standing there going their body looks just like this i can't i know that the monkey can't mingle i know that the bird can't mingle but there's a guy there talking to right over here that's probably uh if i was gonna be adam i'd need somebody to help around the house so i'd get the beast because he could talk monkeys you have to train but the bees could talk so i guess mr miss beast probably lived the closest i'm just saying you don't have to agree with him if you want to but i'ma tell you something eve was real comfortable with that thing around her yeah he didn't go running to adam and say oh that beast is talking to me no he's comfortable she's doing her little work and he's doing his little work and the beast is out there you know maybe sweeping the porch or planting the garden you understand what i'm saying because satan knew he said i think that right there's what i'm going to use because she's comfortable with him and all i'm going to do is i'm going to just step in there and motivate him and help this thing along just a little bit because you know what god said right here look and god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it now brother brown said we'll not subdue it until the millennium i'll bring all those quotes next sunday and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that creepeth or moveth upon the earth so satan is standing there and god's given whatever this being is authority over the whole earth now satan said wait a minute i'm down here now i'm your right-hand guy you see that attitude i'm your right-hand guy but you know satan's over there too he's sitting over in the corner and he's going i'll get him i'll get him when he puts that in human flesh i'll get him he said cause i can motivate that flesh he can't sit and can't get to your soul folks if you're born again cannot get your soul but he sure can play in that spirit realm which goes out into your body amen that's his playground and he knew it as soon as adam and eve were put in the flesh in genesis 2 7. that's right but god had a purpose for putting them in human flesh because he wanted to live in human flesh and he wanted to prove to satan that we could live down here in human flesh and not be a child of satan sure we were all born between satan and eve we were all we'll get to that next next week because here we are spoken word seed he spoke this right here and it come to pass he takes that and he puts it inside of a man named adam in a spirit man not a ghost floating around i believe when he made adam adam was a ruler of the earth now i don't believe adam had any limitation i believe adam could just move wherever he wanted to on the earth brother brown said just like the holy spirit leaves today so the holy spirit's not in one place he's everywhere it's all over the world so adam had that ability to be the god of the earth go around on the other side of the earth and move a tree somewhere that's what he said he said eve he would say oh adam adam i need this moved he said oh stop move whatever but remember that was later on because remember when that man was created and put down here we'll read it later on next sunday we'll stop right here musicians get ready to come we look at the spoken word seed well i tell you what we're gonna have musicians because we're gonna have a communion we'll just sing a song a cappella and then we'll um do the communion service but listen just for a few minutes god's original seed was right here look at me for a minute god see original seed was right here it was spoken law of reproduction was put into into into motion for man listen and for spirit man come on we gotta get you right this is it right here it's a spirit man he's not putting him in flash yet he's telling them to multiply and they don't even have a body like this body they got a body theophany but remember theophany don't sexually reproduce never has never will why remember it wasn't so in the beginning jesus said in the beginning we were not supposed to procreate sexually you say well why are we pro-creating sexually because we were put in human flesh i mean we were put in animal flesh and then when the fall happened it happened that's what happened satan perverted instead of now being a spoken word seed that had to be completely cut off yeah that's right god could not bring his children from a dirty womb now remember the first womb was right here this is one we talk about now the spiritual womb right here eve had to get it right here before she did the act the act was just a culmination of saying okay let's do it right you understand what i'm saying all right so then satan injected himself into the human race and god said okay we can't do this right now but i've already spoken listen god's word is eternal i've already spoken it will happen i got my children i already know who they are they're woven up inside my body the dna of god satan you can bring them in a perverted way that's all right i'll permit that because the animals are doing the same thing i'll permit that but they're going to be under a law now not just the law of reproduction because a woman is under the headship of the man the woman will bring children in childbirth and sorrow all these different things she'll be what subject to the man because remember before the fall folks it wasn't adam and eve right hello they were co-equal they were the same except that the emotional part of eve is what got her in trouble the central part that adam didn't have because when god separated him there stood satan when he separated him and said hmm i know what that is i can get to that i can get to her feelings i'm telling you this is why brother brown that's why women don't preach that's why all these different things that goes on in and now that we that women have to be put under but listen when we get over there on the other side when we get a body change i look what happened look what happened over there in the sixth dimension when brother brown went across the dimension he said that women were hugging me they didn't come up and shake his hand they were hugging him my precious brother even his wife first wife you know my prayer girlfriend my precious brother and my precious brother why all that junk has done away with yes we go back to the original where adam and eve now listen adam and eve stick your finger out adam and eve didn't walk around like this forever how many years before the fall they were husband and wife but they did not produce sexually children before the fall there was a holy ghost veil it didn't matter if they walked around with her arm around her his arm around her and her arm around him she could sit on his lap nothing right that's what we're going back to folks that's why brother brown said it ain't none of that over there jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning you know them pharisees bless their heart well if this one marries seven times and has dies and has ever seven brothers and they come in and they he said will that be in there jesus said carnal carnal carnal right right that will not happen in the resurrection but it's a beautiful thing if we do it right right because it's honored of god on this side right but it wasn't so from the beginning it was to be spoken word right why did it why did why was spoken word listen one more thing for close listen to this aren't you and i the body of christ aren't you now the only body that jesus christ will have on this earth until he comes back and we are his what bride what does the bride produce the egg which is the body that's right but it takes life from the mail that's why he's got a bride on the earth folks because brother brown said she'll be impregnated with the seed word of god spoken every sunday every wednesday every time you mash play every time you get together and talk about the word of god that is a seed going forth that is a seed that will come forth and bring exactly what it said it would bring forth when jesus swing well when jesus said multiply and replenish the earth sure he had to wait a couple thousand years but he came anyway it just it didn't do anything but just it let the old testament come into view for 4 000 years it let that old testament come in profits come in and what built the egg they built the egg what brother brown said brother brown didn't say that that the old testament prophets produced the life they produced the body that's what you and i are to what to be the body of christ we're producing the body of christ because without his life without his spoken seed word you and i are d-e-a-d we are dead oh no i'm alive i can run a 20-mile marathon you're going to die sometime and your soul is going to have to go before god but if you're born again tonight your soul is god your soul is god it's god it always was god in his mind it always was right you and i had to come down here what underneath the water or underneath the fall but you got here anyway yes listen the very image that brother ray gabriel was supposed to be had there not been a fall is sitting here today inside of a man that his mom and daddy had to bring into being right so what are we what we worried about if you're born again today what are you worried about oh i i blame the devil he's the one that's making you old god never wanted you to be old he always wanted you to be young let's stand to our feet he is here hallelujah he is here amen he is here holy holy i will bless his name again amen he is here did he call your name today closely hear him calling out your name he is here you can touch him you will never be it doesn't matter if you come from a prostitute and a and a drunk if you got to see the god in you it's exactly what it was before the foundation the world hasn't changed one bit you've been changed into his image we'll read the scripture next sunday where we there was an earthy and there was a heavenly there's a terrestrial and there's a celestial but that's where the two see because remember if you're a seed of god satan can't touch that but if you're over here on the other side and you and and you become just a natural birth and you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost you're that unholy spirit you're that unholy seed and god can't protect you amen but remember it's not that they're separate i keep walking over here and over here they're right here you're rubbing elbows because it's a religious spirit right so remember that but everything originated from god satan just perverted what he needed to pervert but you know what by foreign knowledge god knew what he would pervert knew how he would pervert it knew how this all thing would come out and it would all work to his honor and glory we we can realize that we come from god and we're going back to god amen we were in that dna strain of the eternal of the creator i was telling louise today listen just go sit somewhere and close your eyes and forget the whole all this junk and just say god place me in your mind i know that's where i came from but to have the mind of christ means that he'll be able to show you these things he'll be able to show you even though there's not a verbatim scripture because the serpent was more was more substantive than any beast of the field didn't say the beast was but when moses was writing it god had him penned that to hide it from the wise and prudent and say we ate an apple or an apricot lord folks listen any grown human being in this building today grown i said grown human being in this building today knows what the original sin is you can't deny it right we know we live in it but you know thank god though there was an original before that there was an original god before there was an original sin and that original god we had our he had us posted up there in the in the halls of heaven he said satan you can't touch that not till i'm done with them when i'm done with them i'll take them home or i'm going to take them in a rapture one of the two but you cannot touch them people oh yeah you can play with this because it's a different seed it comes from it comes from a natural seed but the spiritual word of god is the seed word of god you love the lord now what we're going to do is when brother dale does this brother terrence and brother bob are going to be downstairs outside at the concrete steps so you'll go out the door go down and then he's going to pray over everything up here though they'll take it down there and maybe we won't have to do this again but let's just do it this one time just for precaution but let them pray over that take it downstairs go down and take your your uh i started to say wafer take care take your um we told lisa to make us some bigger wafers so y'all could take them like we do no we can't do that but take your wafer and take your glass and go somewhere and stand separated but only you can be with your family to take communion if you're not going to take communion then you can go on out somewhere else that's okay but it's open communion anybody can take communion wants to it feels like they need to or can or want to it's an ordinance that we have not done for a little while and i believe we ought to do it if you're a christian amen but we'll go when brother dale prays we'll start at the back row go out the back row i'll be down here and i'll help the back row out that way you don't walk back and forth and but between each other right here everybody got that say man okay so when brother dale gets finished he's going to pray over blessing sanctify here brother terence and brother uh bob are going to take it downstairs outside you'll go out the door and take what you need and then go stand over here and then when brother dale he'll be the last one he'll get out there and then we'll all partake at the same time is that okay that all right god bless you brother dale come on love you with the love of lord play for brother louise yeah pray for brother and pray for this one right here he's developed a little bit of a cough yeah yeah the wagon pray for him amen you enjoy the message amen we don't want to never get away from doing this because we love to take communion that's it maybe like you said next time we'll just get it set back up in here and we can move about and do things here different and do everything okay so let's just read our scripture in first corinthians forever received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this new years offers you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever ever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy then drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the restless set in order when i come let's just take a few moments of solid prayer praying one for another and mainly praying for the sick ones among us that the lord would come among us and take away these sicknesses and things you know let's pray silently before the lord others just be with each one reach down and touch us all these old afflictions of the flesh come upon us sometimes lord because of the fallen condition but it also manifests your loving grace unto us as a healer and a deliverer so just have your way forgive our sins and lead us by that understanding lord and as we partake of this communion may we remember what it means to us and what what made it come to pass is what we need to remember we love you and we thank you be with the sick ones among us touch each one and deliver in jesus name amen father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today and for this purpose we come to this place to be able to try to remember lord more about you yes just have your way with us lord let your loving grace be with us thank you by the bread and the partakers in jesus name [Music] so there's people in the message that quit taking communion because he said the lord has come yeah well i don't think that fits in too good where we're at what's going on if if the lord's come we're in bad shape right that's like the saying of the people saying oh we're already in the millennium we are we're in bad shape because there's a whole lot worse for things to come yeah what's going on uh while he's doing that we're going to let the downstairs go first so i'll go down there and then i'll come up here y'all just sing until i forgot about it sorry about the ones downstairs and throw something at me when i get down there brother we're told in that word that we are to take this what we call communion we really know that it's just a sign or a symbol of what took place long time ago but you died on the cross for us and you gave your blood that we could all live father we thank you that we've been told these things and the truth of it where we don't get it confused with the world and all of their doings we just ask you to sanctify this wine today because a symbol of your blood that was for each one of us and just reach down into us lord we've seen it before that you just touched the sick among us by taking the communion because that's what we're doing we're fulfilling thy word doing what we can do the best we can do we ask you to just bless the wine and the partakers now in the name of jesus christ good morning i'll walk by the river i'll wrestle green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come
