amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to isaiah 59 isaiah 59 so good to be here you know it's been quite a while and that when you miss services you know you we can always watch it on the internet but it's still not as i like being here and being in the services and things but we appreciate everything because it just all works for the glory of the lord and honor of the lord brings everything to the right place and he'll get the honor and glory out of it all right it gave us time to sit down and think about you know a lot about where we're at and the day that we're living and things and we'll try to cover a little bit of that today and just an idea you'll see what i'm talking about you know but just we want to thank everybody whether it be on the internet whether it be anywhere around the world we know they were praying for my wife and and everything because see i never was tested as being positive so i started out the the case we went together to then they run the test on us and she wound up being positive i wound up being negative so it's mine's been negative the whole time but i still was limited to being quarantined by uh being with her my uh doctor i talked to him and he asked was you know checking on me and he said you think you've been exposed i said well we've kind of been here in the house together for nearly two months you know a month at least so i think you can be exposed a lot to a lot of things you know because we didn't uh i didn't back up i we did just a little we you know uh pulled back done a few things but other than that forget it because i've always been one thing i'm not afraid of anything the devil can bring now i'm not challenging him i don't do that don't do that you might get in trouble but i do believe in just standing there on it and saying okay the lord take care of it just be positive about it and then if things goes wrong and everything gets shaky then you just keep that positive attitude to say bye stripes i'm healed so if i've got it i'm still okay because i got to god on my side to take care of all of it you know and lead me through but we just thank everybody around the world and everywhere that people are called and and everything and and committed their self to prayer and we just thank god for that and you just keep praying for my wife she still has problems with the congestion in and here that's evidently from the sinuses because so she had that before this ever started it's this thing was six months ago that she had that problem with that and you know if they would have just listened to her when they put her in the hospital uh things would have been a little different because they were running and checking on lungs and heart and things and she said but it's up here and they just bypassed it we didn't give her a thing they sent her home from the hospital with nothing this just turned her loose the next day well then the next time they went in finally they got enough of them together till they did at least give her some antibiotics to help her and i'm sure that that helped a lot on the doing but she kept still trying to tell them you know and they just they wouldn't do it and i believe she'd have been a whole lot quicker getting straightened out if they did just to listen to her a little bit but that's the way they are and that's their concern they said we're concerned with the major thing your lungs and your heart and said everything's perfect said you have no problems and they couldn't figure out how that she could be her um uh what do you call it you're not your blood pressure but where the oxygen level her oxygen level was greater than mine it would always be 95 96 even as much as 98 you know in things that it would be and you know they couldn't figure that out because they thought well that's just you know it's supposed to at least be down some but see god was there taking care of it and you still remember because you still you know i thank god for it thank you for praying thank you thank the brothers here for ministering and taking over and and doing everything you know and and handling all of this church and keeping us running and even going i thoroughly enjoyed the services and things as a matter of fact i got one thought out of one and one out of another one and uh you know uh i'll be bringing these out to you because you know it just clicked in into thinking but uh we'll get into that you know but we just thank everybody thank the family they were so wonderful that they just well we didn't go hungry if you notice i didn't lose any weight i didn't do that there was there was meals on wheels and some of them didn't have to be wheels they just walked them down yeah heels and and took care of us but we haven't went hungry and we thank god for that thank you for everything the family for the cooking and all of the different things and all it's been doing and just thank everybody as i said to the ministers and things around the world we just all keep praying i'm like this i'm just saying this part now so you don't think that i'm picking on anybody or any thoughts but somebody had made a statement about said one brother said that that nobody being bribed wouldn't be affected by or wouldn't um be you know how the disease the virus well i i'm sorry i don't agree with that now i'm just you know you may do it you you that's up to you that you may say well brother so-and-so was well you know well that's one thing for sure i believe in all the truth but i know too you don't uh you don't put it different we're not we're not immune to sicknesses now if you start talking like that then we'll start preaching we'll we'll try to figure out about brother branham and all the things in his life and and try to make it you know if you want to get totally negative we'll get down to talking about him trying to take his own life a couple of times just don't get all that built up till you think that you're so great that you're not going to do it you thank god to take care of it i like what brother uh john martin said one time he said why not pray for to to keep away the sickness instead of praying after you get sick well that's good but that's you know i'm just that away i i'm saying you know satan is attacking the bride of christ as much as he can and see if you'll notice a lot of he's hit the ministers well see you know what that's doing he's trying to destroy that part and then get somebody to come along with a statement that makes others you know get down and out about their thinking about this that or the other well then so you you better think about brother branham said the lord jesus sat on a rock and grown with a headache after raising that little boy from the dead see let's just don't get into this glory situation of doing let's just be human let's face this thing just like we face it every day i didn't get up every day you know scared to death wandering and thing my wife would tell me see you stay in that in the house and i'll stay in that listen i said that's going to be hard to do you know we're going to cross somewhere in here you know and all like that but that's i just do i appreciate everybody and all the concern and all and we just committed all to god and believing and you just keep praying for her that god will reach down and and take this away and all because he can do it okay uh there's anything else let's see yeah brother the wade will be ministering this coming wednesday the lord willing and then we'll we've got some changes or maybe moving a little bit on up in the next week or two you know so uh we would be putting these brothers into line on the weekend because we've got other few little things coming and going but the lord will take care of it we'll all work through and appreciate everything appreciate you out there on the internet for for sitting up there with us you know and and uh listening and doing things and we just appreciate it we keep right on going maybe we can move a little bit faster and we can move back into bringing in uh more people you know and doing things but we just wait to see how that is some of these churches are being hit pretty hard we we have been hit you know pretty good but still we're here and god brought us through it so then we thank god for for all of that okay let's just pray father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for the opportunity of being here today and we pray that you would lord have the preeminence in each one of our hearts and lives bless each one bless the people out on the internet our ways and the things around the country and lord if they can see us back up here fighting for you lord and knowing that all things will work together it just we just have to wait it out sometime and just pray and see how you're going and what's going to take place so we pray that you would just guide us and lord and keep us and bless all of the ones that have confronted all of these things in knowing that you lord will take care of us all we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen there will be a kind of an odd way of going but i want to read this and uh it's an odd thing to use this scripture but then you'll see how it comes out to lord willing uh verse 19 isaiah 59 19. so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord will shall raise up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion now if you go over in romans you'll find out it comes out of zion see here is tucson because it's looking forward to calvary out of zion is over in the new testament where it comes forth you know all right and and to them that turn from trend from transgressions in jacob says the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seeds saith the lord from henceforth and forever you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word but that old devil he does everything he can i thought about it sister my wife going they went and tested her four times you know each time it would be three times was positive the last one had to come forth and be in the negative where sister rebecca went through i think four times i know she did three or four times and then it comes out well uh you know you can get down and out about that and say well what was this what was that what are you worried about you come out of it main thing is get it settled and that's done and finished and you know and uh you say are you um immune to sicknesses like that no but in god we're immune to all things and that's what i was not throwing no stones at nobody that somebody thinks that the bride won't be doing well that's going to be kind of contrary to the way we're going to be speaking today so we're going to be talking about persecution not tribulation now remember this and we'll remark over and over we do not the prophet did not believe the bride of christ would go through the tribulation persecutions yes troubles and heartaches and trials yes but not through the tribulation uh if you want these i've got plenty of them laying on the desk but he said on one of them he said you see there he said um the sixth seal he said that's the tribulation he said in the sixth seal it's all way on over after the rapture of the bride she's done gone when the tribulation comes in so it'd be kind of hard to put the bride into the tribulation now persecutions persecution is a part of a christian's life it's not to be that we're supposed to be put into this world to be uh not to have troubles and things amen and no it's not that away those things are part of a christian's life and and really that's why i said we can stand and pray really do you realize we're listening last night i guess not for the last one do you realize that it's an honor for god to be able to tell the devil come on satan have you considered my servant zach he said yeah but he ain't supposed to get sick now show me that in the bible many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord leadeth out of them all right you say what but but but now are you saying that sickness is a is of god no it's permitted permitted to bring us to the position but in order to bring us to the position of faith that we know and realize we get through it i mean a common thing that we used to think about is to say it we used to think about a common cold with nothing but you look at it now and you call it a common cold you call it a a virus now and it's affecting the whole world well but you see god's right in the midst of it all right let's don't lose faith let's glory into seeing what not the glory that we're sick i never say god thank you for making me sick i said god thank you for thanking enough of me to allow these things to come on me because the prophet said satan cannot put on you nothing unless god allows it well you mean death heartache sorrow trouble yeah that's right are you going to argue with the prophet don't argue with the bible no well see we don't glory in sickness we glory in the savior this is displaying his attributes if we wasn't sick his attributes of healer would not be displayed well see we could get on that and just keep going okay all right let's see if i can get back on where i'm going wade made a statement here not too few weeks ago or something he was talking and uh he was talking about and showing you remember how that uh a church age would come forth a messenger would come and the things you know and why that would be and that it would would actually always be because of people falling away right people falling away then persecution strikes the church drives her to the position that she turns to god each church age is at a white sea then at the ending of all of that up then a revival comes because of those things each church age then had a revival see martin luther when that aids been run down he ran out there with that message of the just shall live by faith and revival started well all right then i think that the way it is is why because we'll read one in a minute what the prophet said but see people reject the word of god all right they get all tied up you think about where we're living now because we're not back there with lutheran wesleyan we're living here and you think of how that what things have happened in the past year you say well all i can think about is a virus you don't think about it like a year ago that the people of this message began to just start falling away large groups large amounts of people that was in the message ministers that have been preaching 30 40 years or more and all at once they just fallen away turning to to all kind of doctrines and ideas amen well then here come a plague right brother randall said they turned down my message he said then the plagues will fall he said famine will come amen amen and he said not necessarily for the food but said for the hearing then he goes on and says man physical too before the hearing of god's word well now you look at it i i'm trying to make this i mentioned it a few times in doing this hitting it in the services to get you to think but you think about where we are now and where we've been and what's been taking place well see then what do you expect i expect a revival for the bride of christ to turn back to god and realize that hey wait a minute wait a minute these things are happening out here i mean did you ever think about that you would come we uh you know we used to we talked about it some and terence and us was right another day talking about it and and you just wonder well hey what's you know what do you expect next that's right hey don't tell him what's going to come next i'm not a doomsday gloomy preacher i'm just telling the truth i've always been i guess you call it a little optimistic and maybe very little pot pessimistic but i'm positive about everything but i know for sure things are going to take place do you expect god to pour yeah because the people have turned him down that's what your prophet will read what he said see when the children of israel they went down into egypt you realize they went into egypt as victorious people they never went into egypt into bondage they went in there and for probably uh for those 400 years if they were there probably two or three hundred years they were the victorious children of israel living in in goshen and everything running so wonderful then they started turning away from god then they wound up being into slavery right they didn't go down there as slaves study a little bit read your bible that's 400 years down there and probably two or three hundred years of that they were victorious people until ramesses come off the scene and this come off the scene i can't never keep up with those guys are but you know what i'm talking about but listen see then when the people turn away from god then it's automatically going to come a persecution i know i've fought this ever since i've been in the message i know the prophet i got them laying at the house so if you want to read them i got a lot of them laying in there if you want to read them i try to make myself straight and honest oh the bride ain't going to go through no persecution right ain't going through tribulation but she's going through persecution that's right why because the bible said that's right amen do you realize what isaiah was saying you realize what's saying right there it brags on and shows up to being you know when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord is going to read up a standard what do you realize that means that the enemy is going to come amen right it'll come to zion okay we'll get to jeremiah in a few minutes where he said you've turned down god and done this and he said you've got a hoarse forehead boy i'll tell you what so brother ain't got no horse forehead i'm proud of jesus christ ain't no persecution you just you just don't preach it right and you well okay go somewhere else find something else because we're running out of time folks you can bank on one thing we're running out of time all right see you if it's another 50 years we'd be running out of time i don't think many of you and me going to make it 50 years in natural life so let's don't get concerned about it well see i i've had i've talked to the church here i've tried to preach it for years that i believe in the the bride coming through persecution because the brother the prophet said the bride is as strong as that persecution amen that's right but you don't want it that way oh you want a glorious all right that's the reason i'm trying to take this day to announce this part you think about where we are now you remember two or three months ago when you could not go to church oh yeah we could have done yo yo okay yo yo yo you can't you'll go ahead i said you say well oh and and look what you just think about i mean some of you coming and talking about we're all talking about how that we stayed at home for the first time in our christian experience we could not go to church you realize a pen stroke and we would have been totally put out you realized and i'm not far trump against trump i don't worry about it all right that's right but you see if he hadn't come up with the point of saying hey if you're going to keep the beer joints and the liquor joints and the food and everything open we're going to keep the church open amen well he may not be no good he may be this but he may get eternal life for making that one statement too i'm not for him or against him or for this other man and the woman he's got running with him or whatever it's all got to be there the bible says i put in kings i take out kings it ain't nothing to me and you you can go and vote all you want to when i found out that we voted and put john f kennedy in office i quit voting because when we voted and put a catholic in i didn't vote no more and i didn't want to help it you realize a terrorist terrence he's he he gets his carnal point in sometimes but he's straight but you realize that we put in the office what the prophet said i don't care if you vote for trump or or i don't know what his name is either one of them you're going to put in the office your vote is going to put in the office a crook right right that's both sides nothing right you're gonna you're gonna vote it in he said the only thing we could ever done we should have done that you realize back when when gold was 35 an ounce if we'd have thought what brother branham said he said the church is going to get all the wealth of the gold and everything you know doing all this and the other and it's 35 an ounce what is it now fifteen hundred dollars an ounce or something i mean i don't even know because i ain't got nothing to keep up with i i count i got two or three pennies and that's it i mean i ain't got you know but the point is to look at what we're doing we vote in the people that the prophet said this is what would happen okay listen because that's what we want to get to we want to get to something just think about a point now my whole point is way based upon one thing now remember brother branham says over over over how many times the bride does not go through the tribulation amen now if you want a bunch of them i'll be glad to give it to you i got one in here in a minute uh let's see number four how can i overcome where he says the bride does not that's just one i just wrote it off and you're to know it don't don't study the message me the bride does not go through the tribulation because she's not got anything to be be purged of that she gets rid of it that's why we're here now to get rid of these things all right and see then but the bride has always been a hunted and persecuted a little group of people it's always been that right they've never been to people if there was in the church you can figure one thing for sure they were the crooks maybe the wrong way to say it but you know if you if you was able to control the world you got a problem and that's what we're gonna strike in just a minute so we get to the point all right but this let's go on see when people turn down the word now this is my point when they turn down the word of god all right back up year or two and look what's happened amen if you can't see that then you're blind as a bat and it don't matter anyway to see how the people of this message have turned against brother brown's message that's what i told you there was enough all of us you know hard heads back there in the 70s and things that when they come out with that about brother brown and we had the wrong dates out there in arizona you know um in you know colorado or whatever when he was out there with it and they claim he had the wrong dates well we faced that in 1970 but there was enough old heads until they said forget it we don't care what his dates are in time he brought us to christ which is the opening of god's word but now you don't have them to stand up for that well they started hunting something else just like one brother came here wonderful brother good little brother he came here probably his second sermon or something and you know and he preached wonderful and glory hallelujah and a month later he was denying the things the prophet taught because he found out there's a date different if that's all it takes you can find it because that brother said brother branham said if you see me off on one thing he said then you tap me off on everything well okay brother brandon was off on the white horse rider so let's go home let's eat drink and be married and get out of this junk no light had never shined upon that so there was no way nobody could judge it all right come on but you see the thing of what i want you to think about think about the order of events when people reject the word all right automatically persecution comes because brother branham says god goes out i get time to read it don't do it this evening all when the people get to to turning that down the word see then they start a little group of people always raises up and starts crying out for deliverance it's been that way in every church age to crying out for deliverance god would answer that with the next message that was to come see then what are you expecting you say yeah but that brother dale you just make you make the people of this message now i'm trying to tell the truth did it happen amen has it happened amen that's right would you ever thought about all the people that's turned against this message the name brands would you ever thought they would have done the way they've done no and poor old people gets caught i don't blame the people i blame the preachers the preachers are once carrying away well see jeremiah says you wound up with a horse forehead you know what a forehead is a denominational thinking person that's what it is a denominational thinking person a jezebel religion because that's where it comes from all right but listen but when the people begin to cry out for deliverance now look at the children of israel they said they were victorious people for a long time but then they begin to dally around and getting tied up and getting into the world and getting into the the systems and all and they begin to fall away from the word of god as they did then god began to make preparation to put him into a persecution because what else could he do you're going to blame god for it no and what else can he do you realize he's bringing the persecution to save us come on that's the way i think i'm sorry he's bringing the tribulation upon i mean persecution upon us i use that word tribulation just remember what i said the prophet taught it we believe it the bride don't go through the tribulation because ain't nothing to be purged for all right but see persecution always comes the prophet said it brings strength to the bride brother branham will say things like this he said god wants to prove to satan that his little bride won't fall like eve did so he allows these things to come on us he allows these things to take place all right but follow me now but i i'd brother dale i don't i don't believe i know the quotes i don't mean i know all of them i'm not saying that that's junk i'm saying it like this i've studied this message for 50 years out of 50 years of studying something you ought to know a little bit well i didn't have to go run up a whole lot of quotes when i got to considering these things because i already had them wrote down because i've always preached it this way i've always preached that the bride turns down the word the bride oh no that's them denominations turn down the word now the bride gets tied up with the world and the systems of things and goes away from the word of god the bride was the one and i've argued with ministers from this pulpit about it the bride is the one that went down to narcia what your prophet said she had no right to go they went no but but brother dale you don't understand it wasn't the bride will you tr argue with your prophet then because you ain't going to take what i say and you won't listen to this part there's people on the internet right here probably are sitting there saying i tried to tell him out years ago he still believes you better believe i still believe it amen and i'm praying for god to send it i preached a message persecution why we must have it amen because it's going to drive us to our knees we're going to get rid of ourselves one way or the other god's going to be victorious if he has to bring us down to our knees and crawling to beg him to get everything straight amen are you going to talk to him about it and tell him he's wrong help yourself all right but listen there's going to come a persecution on the bride we know it'll come on the foolish virgins and the things like that we know it'll come on the jews the 144 thousand the fifth sealed jews and the things are in persecutions and things and they wind up then people wind up going into the tribulation but the bride of christ don't go to the tribulation she goes to glory and i'm choosing the time to preach on it because to realize and try to knock the little things into our heads to think as i said a moment ago who would ever thought three or four months ago didn't you get hungry for the word didn't you get hungry for coming to church i did we was doing good we were still using the devil in our using the devil's equipments and the things like that to get the message out to the people but that didn't satisfy it to me i want to stand up in the church and declare jesus christ to be the same yesterday today and forever and tell the devil to go hide but i ain't going to argue with him i ain't going to challenge him i ain't going to do no i'm going to try to preach the truth because that's all i've ever done but to look at it the way it's supposed to be see you're thinking that i'm looking at it as a doomsday persecution but remember the persecution comes but remember what follows the persecution amen it's a revival because god always comes on the scene every church age he would do it they would get away from the word of god he would send a pr a messenger amen and they'd bring the message and the people would start rejoicing and a revival would strike well it ain't trying to see how mean we can get where god can send a revival i mean ain't no preaching like that but it's better than what most people preach you know at least it's sensible but listen let's just read a few because that's what i want us to do i want us to to just think about these and we'll take it this season i know we won't get through so we'll go so far and we'll quit and go this evening and uh go ahead with number one let's start from just read jeremiah and just remember what it says lift up thine eyes unto thy high places this is jeremiah 3 2 and 3. and see where thou hast not see where thou hast not been lined with in the ways hast thou set for them as the arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with the whoredoms thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness now this is israel we know the natural that's a type of the bride of christ well you don't know you don't know okay now watch what he says therefore the showers have been withholding if you think it's just for for all these other then i thought we were okay let's finish up what we're talking about therefore the showers have been withholding and there has been no latter rain a lot of rain that doesn't concern nobody but the bride of christ come on we're going to change it in just a minute because there has been no revival right what's the difference in latter rain and revival it's the same wording same thoughts as implied latter rain is a revival there's been no revival why and thou hast a forehead that refuses to be ashamed brother dale ain't got no horse forehead i i've got the mind of christ yeah i'll remind you in a different way than to preach to your heart about it i remember i mean remind you of one thing a few months ago you weren't able to come to church you had to be hand-picked even still on that basis of picking and choosing who's getting to come to church because the government has set it up that way what do you think they're going to do you realize as i said a while ago a stroke of the pen they stopped us from having church something that i'd never thought of in my life hey i'm pretty smart i ain't that smart i mean that is a joke no he's in life but i mean it is a joke because that whoever thought about what would take place i've studied this message for 50 years and argued and fussed with people about the persecution points and the thoughts and things for 30 to 40 years trying to figure out how is this going to take place run around and say something here and then he'll say something there and he'll say now this guy and he'll say that's that says the lord the minute he'll say something that sounds like totally contrary see i wonder did god show him everything right when he gets to the point one time he said i'm presuming he said now listen i'm not prophesying i'm presuming i'm not saying he didn't know what he's talking about i'm wondering how much he did know when he made that statement there years ago i mean it struck me what he said one day it'll come he said black and white are dying fighting again and die like flies well i thought that the next message he said that was my idea right but what are they doing now with all of this riots and the things he could have been looking at a whole lot more than what we think because i remember when he said on the sixth seal you remember that he's on the sixth hill he said i had to go outside i cannot he said i cannot tell them that lord it's in the sixth seal something that he could not tell the bride of christ persecutions though we don't want persecutions well what if that's part of a christian life you don't want it well no we don't want to dig it up no we don't get in front of the train now and holler to the train hey i'm going to stand here no we don't do like that we just face things straight up as they are and realize right where we're standing you tell me right now you didn't see me run out here three months ago and say but i'll tell you what so we gonna challenge the world because we're gonna have services every day of the week i wanted to when they said we couldn't do this couldn't do that but it's in groups and different things i wanted to say y'all forget it we're going to have seven days of the week services every day we're going to challenge the government brother branham never challenged it he had to abide by what they were doing remember it cost him about 40 something thousand dollars for them to pay off that debt that they demanded on that when he said i don't owe them one dime he said i'm not going to pay it brother got what him told him and then you won't be able to travel or do nothing see i knew that i could holler out and scream here and say we're going to fight this well some of you would come into services and we'd fight it but what good would it do i said okay we'll just abide for a while you remember when i made the statement this is not the end of all things it's just the beginning of the end well i hope you see today one thing if we can get to it do you realize we're right here facing a stroke of the pen and you've got your jews and your catholics coming together for a covenant that the bible says will take place all it takes is stroke of a pen how close are we to it because that's one thing that hit me real hard to think about i'm sorry i'm just human when brother branham would talk about and say that they'll pay off our nice our national debt see i looked at the national debt of the church dummy i was looking at it because they're going to pay off the church is dead they're not going to pay off the churches dead church don't have no debt don't pay off the world systems don't pay off the world national debt then it'll go to the point of the church come on we'll follow brother branham if we're not looking at things and trying to keep it in a line we're looking at it what we think it is we don't want to be in no persecution we don't want no troubles brother dale we don't want none of this where are we going but he says there's a persecution coming he said yeah but now brother dale that's what i mean i know that's that's for the foolish virgins and that's the jews and that's them it ain't for us well okay okay then just go to sleep okay go to number two which is jezebel religion and i would invite you to read or listen to the tape jezebel religion it will be a great eye-opening thing all the way through and many many things that the prophet said now listen and when ahab was on the throne you say he's on the throne that's right but jezebel was the head behind that throne she was the one that done the leading look what she took the very laws of the land and twisted them around and for her own gain and for greed and made ahab do it now are you thinking about what they've done they've took the laws of the land and twisted it and pulled it and i've told you over and over you cannot put a church in this town without permission from one of the established churches in this city you want to talk to somebody walk across the street and ask the man over there that that time was assistant mayor and he was trying to get his shirts doing he was a baptist the baptist wouldn't have him didn't like him he had to go to back here to the church of god or something over on the backside of town and get them to okay that he could put up a church that's right here you better check your little charter things where you signed in these communities when you bought your home because if you'll read in there you'll find out after a while it says you cannot have service without it you know of some more no more than five people or something but you don't look at that oh brother dale he just go look go find out huh but look because she was married to him i twisted him around for her own gain and for greed and mayday have do it because she was married to him and that's the way with our leader today i don't say he isn't a nice man but look what's behind him look at your dates what is it yeah kennedy because it's 1961 today but look what's behind him the harlot the very thing that we run here to be to america far in order to come over here to get away from it and the very principles that america has built upon we by our own free choosing elected a thing like that how many of you voted for john f kennedy don't raise your hand we ain't gonna zoom in around anyway but i'll put mine up cause i did i said that's the last time i voted then i did find out it was a pretty good thing because you know about that times where you found out you if you voted for one you're just voting for the other that's how crooked it was then now look we buy our own free choosing we buy our own preacher elected a thing like that now you see why my voice is going to be stopped pretty soon somebody's going to know yes why revelations 2 20. because it's a prophetess in the things he called herself a prophetess you just watch the wave of sin happening now get your point of what i'm talking about what causes it to happen what brings persecution the wave of sin okay are you listening you watch the corps go plum to the core you watch modernistic watch ungodly things happen in the churches and finally there will come a persecution the bible says so thus saith the lord certainly there will be okay come on i'm gonna get you off the hook this does say if the lord it's gonna be for the foolish virgins that says the lord is gonna be for them but it does say the lord's gonna be for the bride too because the rest of them don't need it it's no problem all right let's go ahead so there's gonna be a persecution okay go up to paragraph 97 which was there you go see what happened after that after the attack his voice became quiet nobody heard him no more god called him off the scene said elijah you've done made your message known to all of israel they know it now come up here in the wilderness get away from them separate yourself because i'm going to do something i'm going to show them what it is to turn my message down what said in war famine starvation what followed his message back there of the elijah war famine starvation what struck when the prophet came people turned down his message what stroke all kind of depressions all over the 30s which would be a little bit prior to brother browning but it was still in the bases of it you had your great depression look what's happening all down through there see thus saith the holy spirit watch what's coming watch what's going to follow there was a famine there will be a famine oh maybe not for bread but for the hearing the word of god and his truth all the churches will socialize and go right on into it just the same just like they're already been swallowed up with it when god sends forth a message and he tells the people and they don't receive it then he withdraws his servant now listen withdraws his servant and sends his plagues famine death spiritually speaking physically also you watch for a depression brother you think you've seen something you just wait after a while you haven't seen nothing you think you're dying for a good spiritual revival you wait till after a bit you just wait long and cry to hearing the word of god now thank with me like i've said over and over how many times three months ago you were saying to me brother dale we've missed coming to church you was trying to to get your name in the pot to get to come to church don't you think that's a famine or depression a hard time i did i wanted to come to church i hated to think we'd ever have stripes in there to where you couldn't sit close enough i never thought none of this would take place did you but it's put us into a depression you tell me it's not then go talk to your government about it what are you going to do there'll be a famine in the last days the bible said so said the prophet and not for bread and water alone but for hearing the true word of god but that voice will be quiet in the wilderness somewhere head away okay you know what that goes to so i don't mind saying it those things goes to the point of thinking that brother branham is going to return i don't have no problems with it i ain't never arguing with nobody about brother brown i'm going to return they're not going to return and you know i'm just saying that because i'm blunt i'm playing see your mind clicks off and gets over on something i have still listening to what i'm talking about they just make it to be sung where did we get to all right number four let's go to that one because that's the one that that i want you to get how can i overcome but i can't agree with him because he talked to somebody about it and you'll see the point cause i don't see it but it doesn't pertain to salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the lord he sees the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification i say the blood of jesus christ purify their church see its needs no i believe that the church goes through the tribulation period the church listen organization but the bride does not see the church will go through the tribulation but not the bride all right glory for that there's going to be a revival would you choose a woman you have to purify her before you married her see christ christ's bride is chosen and she is elected and she is god's bride the bride of jesus christ well that's must be talking about the bride because that's what i want okay okay go ahead philadelphian church age well keep thee from our temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation as a matter of fact it's a statement it won't why if it meant that it would have said that but it said i will keep thee from the hour of temptation he's going to keep us he's going to send a revival right amen he's going to send a lot of rain this temptation is exactly like the temptation to need it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to god's commanding word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and the life-giving as is to fool the world now let's go back to where we was while ago trump's rating went up when he says if you're going to have the doors open to the brewer and we're going to open it to the church his raiding went sky right but what if he's the antichrist oh no no no that's the pope we're going to get that a little bit you might be looking at pope the wrong way you might have to listen the pope don't have to pay off our national debt all he's got to do is tell somebody else go pay it right exactly right and nobody's gone and they think oh he's a wonderful guy look what he's done and then you some we get up here and say something against the guy and you know what they'll say to you well okay if that's the way y'all think that we're the antichrist then you go pay the bills for your mom and daddy they're in a nursing home and you go pay all of that it's gonna come in like flattery because the bible says it will come on maybe more serious than we're thinking see only the elect will not be fooled the temptation will come as follows the ecumenical move that has started on what seemed such a beautiful and blessed principle what was it fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one that's what that started on becomes so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause the all to join with her either directly or through appearance ad herbs are very pronounced to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council right little groups will lose charters privileges so forth until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local ministerial associate approves it in many if not most cities you cannot rent a building for a religious service i just told you for 20 years i've been telling you that you can't come to this town it's been tried two times i know of that they put a church right down here in the middle of town it lasted a month i'm trying to tell you we're in that we're in the place we're in a position right well yeah we're looking for it oh i don't see no tribulation i don't see no that's what that's lulling you to sleep and then somebody like me said something well bless god you go pay my bills then cause he agreed to pay my bills well i hope we get far enough because if we don't i'll quote you this one brother ryan says keep your homes and belong to the catholic church oh no that's not the bride that's not just well okay let's see how far do we get down yeah it's almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical groups as this pressure increases and it will it will be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they will feel it is better to serve god publicly in the framework of this what organization than not to serve him at all publicly we've got to serve him we've got to serve god and the only way we can serve god is through that church system do you see where it's coming the error to believe the devil's lie is to serve satan even though you may want to call him jehovah but the elect will not be deceived amen what about it going to the next where are we number six sumerian and if you think this shocking just wait until the prophecy of revelations 13 is fulfilled and read revelation 13 you see the image of the beast coming up and this comes up over here and this one is killed and the uh you know the the thing uh stroke but it comes forth and raises up and becomes a great church system wow it is strictly true that the united states of america is in the chapter the very number 13 is a symbol of this nation it started with 13 colonies his flags has 13 stars and 13 stripes and there is her destiny in the 13th chapter right in this image that is mentioned is this chap in this chapter will be found all the wickedness of the beast that was before it as the beast rose up at night see a council so the image will come out of the world council of churches with all uh ungodly and satanic power to vent the anger of anger of the devil upon the true vine of god now if you don't call that but i want to be a druva myself it will be a repeat performance of all diabolical cunningness and cruelty sure we ain't going to be destroyed no we ain't going to be destroyed no not the bride well she's got some hard roads to go you say well that's that sounds like doomsday to me brother go ahead to the next one those who fight the humble of god and scoff and destroy let them do it and do it they will and all in the name of god and religion but they lie they are not o god they are of their father the devil they by their deeds against any people expose themselves for what they are let them organize and repudiate the little flock they will but further reveal to all that they are of the devil they are the false vine divine that murders their hatred proves who they are now watch in a minute when it comes to murder because rhetoric said you can be killed for praying for the sick you get the word murderers and their hatred and proves that nicholas and doctrine church is who they are they shall be cast into prison yes they are hauled now listen now this is this is not them doing it they shall be cast into prison yes they are hailed into court and falsely accused and tried and imprisoned and that of course it is all done in the name of religion and decency and outraged innocence all done for a good cause that makes me think of the supreme court's ruling on prayer and the bible reading and things it's another angry outburst against god listen can't you see my point of what i'm trying to get at you don't believe in the persecution because you don't think god would allow you to do it well what if he's doing that for your perfection oh my god not a god like that well okay all right but you see folks that's what i said i've preached on these for years and years but i chose this while i was all thinking about it i'm thinking surely god how dumb and idiots we would be to not to look down and see for months and months these things are working right in the things of of the devil and his ways of doing things but yet also in god's ways of bringing it to pisces and allowing these things to happen and bring it right down to the point to get the little bride to the point that she would call out for deliverance yeah but i've always believed god was a good god amen he certainly is let's see let's see if we can get a little bit more where we got number number eight christ is the mystery of god reveal and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon shut up all the churches you see that in churches like this so evidently they must be talking about branham tabernacle on time who is not denomination they'll use them for storehouse anything and if any man goes and offers a prayer for anybody else that don't belong to the ecumenical movement will be shot on the spot it's already that lutheran minister the head of it said so and it's right here you can read it right here in your magazine i love this one i'll read this to you because i don't want you to miss it because you'll see that i'm not doomed today we're gonna have to end it before we get to it but hold on just a minute don't make any difference what they say that church will stand all right because she's already proved it right we're not gonna be down and out we're not gonna miss it go ahead to the next then number nine sardis in church age you know we're living in the end time it is in the end time that the churches are going to come together and as they are even now controlling world politics they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or sell you will lose all those who stay true to god and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of churches orders will be physically bereft now you look at word of rev means you're going to lose all and like i said you know what are you going to do hey talking to my two boys what are you going to do here it comes up mom and dad is too old to work if you don't take care of them we're going to dump them well you're going to have to take care of us are they gonna dump you i mean you're not fuss i ain't making no point i'm just making a point i'm trying to get you to look at a point all it takes is a stroke of the pen and you and i got problems that's why i'm saying i got a call the other day in my life sister called she said brother dale said i'm trying my best to do something you said i said okay good i'm glad you are i said what did she say i'm trying to get my ducks in a row and i said well okay i hope you're getting your ducks in a row you know what she was meaning what do i need to do you know what i've told you over and over and over we're not the mormons that put up a year's supply of groceries but that's a good idea but you still ought to at least buy up a few things and set them up in your cabinets at home you may need them in the next few months what's it going to hurt well that would be me showing my lack of faith come on you're going to live by faith i'm going to live by can of beans if i can get them that's my faith you say you're acting silly no i'm not i'm trying to make it look like you're acting silly because why does it matter if you lived out where we do when the power company comes out there and and the lights it off for four days and everybody up something down the road's got power and we don't have any you'll wind up putting up a can of beans here in yonder you'll buy a generator you'll do things to try to preserve what you got right that's right we've been without power for four or five days when the people all the way around us had power well until they get it connected all the way back to gainesville we don't get it down here because we're on the end of the line that's just a natural story to tell you what is that old statement don't let your left hand know what your right hand is do it or whatever it is listen church what are we doing they'll lose all those who stay true to god and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church orders will be church orders will be physically bereft that will be presented to them a great temptation to give in preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve god within the framework of the antichrist beast system they will give in to the flatteries and banishments of the hierarchy listen i'm not a dummy i know something else too you got people right now that are out there fussing listening to me saying it's about persecution coming to a group of people abroad and they're going to be the ones there they're they're going to say you're faults you're wrong you're wrong on teaching that stuff like that when you let it come to time when the debts come to and they're going to knock on my door and want some money to get by do you get it oh yeah you can fuss and argue all you want to now you're going to do this now but when it comes to you're hungry you're going to be hungry i'll do like i told them at work one time we were getting laid off the night shift and there's everybody saying well we're going to do this we're going to do that so what are you going to do sam i said well i'm i'm going to i'm going to get up my beans and my corn and my stuff that i got fixed and i said i'm going to make sure that i got me a good milk bucket i said what are you going to do with the middleweights i'm going to build the neighbor's cow because i'm going to live all right say sorry but listen because you don't like for me to be blunt like that but the very people that are against you now for your thoughts you let them get hungry they'll be at your house and they'll condemn you you mean you're not going to give me nothing to eat you're you ain't a christian how long did we talk to the lady sitting right out here terrence that lady kept saying it i mean you're supposed to be a christian you're supposed to help me i said hep is one thing doing what you want to get me done that's right no but in the judgment they will all be found naked they will not be given those white robes see the people that reject it won't neither will they walk with him you can't walk in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil hear and then expect to be with god it is time to wake up and to hear the voice of god crying now i'm right putting that in there because of one thing this message is the life's message that was to strike the earth right we're not looking for another message to come another messenger to come another thing to take place no we've already had the message the message has been delivered to us by the prophet of god we've got that message what follows that when the people reject that message they have no right to cry out for help i don't want to hold if i can get that one okay let's see don't protect your sin they're receiving not of the plagues they mean god is speaking shun the religions of this world like you shun the plague i don't mean we don't have neighbors we've got neighbors over here we do anything they want us to do they do anything we want to do not talking like that sunday religious ideas the principles are the thoughts the doctrines the denominational that's your mark of the beast where's the market to be in your forehead not stamped up there your forehead is where your thinking is at and see you've got their doctrine in there and they're in the hands i mean you've got the money in your hand we're already to that point they received none of our plagues god is speaking out showing the religion of this world like he's shown to play leave off walking with the world and make your garments wipe repent it with repentance and the blood of jesus go ahead i'm trying to find one and i'll quit on it this is from the assuming of the church ages the false church groups will come together in a world council of churches this world council of churches is the image erected to the beast revelations 13 11-18 okay this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control this ecumenical move will end up with rome at the head even though the people did not envision it that way this is so because in revelation 17 3 through it states that the mystery babylon is seated on the beast she is controlling the lies of our fourth empire this roman church is going is doing that with the world church system under her control will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to the rome because rome controls the goal to the world now we'll get to there because we're not going to we'll get to that this evening the gold of the world does all the people have to belong to the world church systems or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or head hey now before you throw too many stones just remember the bride don't go through the tribulation and that is pertaining to the tribulation when the mark of the beast comes into view sure i'm not telling because that's what it is the image of the beast is erected in in the tribulation and different things like that so sure it applies for that but it applies where it says this mark in the hand is what it means you know the power with the great power the church systems will persecute roll that on up before we get to bottom the true bride now during that where you'd see he's talking about the true bride see with this great power the church system will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching so forth her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and the truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist listen in person takes over and this is getting on over closer to my revival okay this complete world system of church of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch them away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb i'm not a doomsday we'll start on these things and pick it up because if i go any further i want to go into that we'll pick it up this evening and think about it i'm just trying to get me and you to think about one thing just look around where we're at in the past year that we've been we went in the past year from what i said while ago to a people of this message turning against brother branham to denouncing in him and and condemning the message and condemning all the things he taught and going out with their own doctrines and ideas of all kind of forms then all at once plague started falling but i've got one in here somewhere i'll read it where the prophet said that's what you do you turn against the message and you do god pulls her back what did he do to the children of israel when they were the victorious people resting in the egypt of their time they were they were there they were they were the happy people for i don't know what if it was a hundred years it was because it was there 400 years really 430. but if it was a hundred years still it's my point's right the children of israel never went to egypt as as enemies i mean you know as as slaves and things they went there as that pharaoh put them out there onto the greatest land that there was the goshen and put it there and set them up as the people but gradually they started falling away gradually they started taking the things of the romans and getting involved with them and god pulled away pulled away his presence let him go under the persecution they went under persecution for no telling how many years that they were there they were under the persecution of rome egypt but you know what one day they walked out of there as victorious people the bible says they raged egypt in other words i looked it up one time i mean they really just physically destroyed it got to work that they really evidently god this must have blessed the people because if you listen to prophet and then get your bible and read it you'll see they would actually must walk up to the neighbor and say if you got any gold i need a bunch of gold to take with me we're leaving tomorrow and you ain't going to need it that's right you got any food and the bible says they raised them they took everything they had they walked out of there victorious in a revival okay we know for sure a few years later they was in the wilderness of sin we know it's a continual cycle that's my point is through the church age is a continual cycle god would move on the scene bring a message the message would go forth and the people would receive it then after a while it starts slowing down gradually deteriorating from that message to the truth of what it was and as it does god sends plagues god sent viruses and things all the way down he sent this virus but this is the only one you'll find in the bible or anywhere that has struck the whole world if i'm wrong on that you come tell me but i've studied the bible in this message a long time this is the only time it's all worldwide these plagues is worldwide on this one but you see we'll get to it this evening when we begin to see that the catholic church has the gold rome has the bonds i mean the catholic church has the the bonds of jews has the gold 168 billion is what's listed in the church book now that was in 1960 how much is that now when gold is 1500 an ounce or something how much gold do they have they didn't need no more after that was done 1960 they had 168 billion they didn't need another dollar the interest on it would take care of it hey i remember i read a little bit you remember when they put social security enacted you know social security was enacted back into what 40s or what it was the time you all get the dates on that you know there's enough money put in that bank for that until there was never to be anybody have to pay taxes no more you didn't was not set up for you to pay social security it was enough money set aside to take care of everything but it wouldn't set aside for you for it to come to be taking care of 15 babies and and all this and the other you know and all of these things that the people wound up with in life my point we're here you may not be in church next week what are we going to do how about what the prophet see me and brother used to ride around hunt old houses and things said well we get by a few days in that one it sure needs some fixing up but we'd have to turn on a lot somewhere and put a little water in to do something we're talking about these things brother brown says meet an old store buildings or homes they gonna shut us up they're gonna put us up they're gonna put the pressure on and makes me and you turn to god come on lord send it down on us turn us to you to worry that we've got to get back into where that you can not walk away from us prophet said to dunn said they walked away said god walked away i'm a musician i didn't want it to go into the whole thing but i want to put something to see them because i want you to get into i want you to think about it between services and then listen this afternoon the world council of churches is not paying off the church's debt it's paying off the national debt of the whole united states and the world all the gold standard to pay off the national debt of america won't won't change it but to change the the gold standard of the whole world i'll say it to you like this i wouldn't think you could walk through the vatican and look down you know 168 billion dollars in gold sitting right there probably if you walk through the vatican you'd be surprised you know if you walked into our uh what do you call it uh where the the uh money is made you know it used to be that you had to have a dollar in gold for a dollar bill that was printed you think they got any gold in fort knox no they found out a few years ago they didn't have nothing there you ain't got no ability to pay your debts you gotta have a goal to do it but get my point it's not the vatican the catholic church i'll review this it's not sitting there in the catholic church 100 billion dollars late out there no i ain't gonna call names but you know what i'm talking about the super rich the illuminati the super rich like they said about uh e paul getty they told him one day said you lost it a million or a billion dollars he said paperwork and his life well okay sam won't ya this life paperwork he didn't have that money laid on the bank them rich guys ain't got a bank full of a house full of gold they got control all the way down through the world system it's not to pay off the catholic church it's not to pay off the well what we do now we owe we owe a hundred thousand dollars on this church up here at lula so we'll just let the catholic church pay it off don't be silly it's the world system the gold standard has got to be we'll review this afternoon come on let's stay what do we [Music] the got [Music] i will praise the lord [Music] i will pray [Music] i've got the bible and the prophet's message to tell us when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard jesus [Applause] i will praise the lord one more time anybody have a need i will say [Music] what is [Music] see we know the story we read the back of the book i used to they tried to get me to make book reports how many of you used to do that in school you know we used to have to make a book report well i always loved to read but i hated it right to get anything like that so i'd get my sister to write out the book report and i'd sign it and hand it in you know because she loved to read and write but my point is one thing i could read a book and i didn't read it like you read it you read it you go through it i looked at the front of it in that little example in the front it'll always tell you the characters of the story john and mary uncle and aunt soon him so you know it always told him right in front of it a little introductional part well then the last few pages always said and john and mary got married and lived happily ever after [Music] i didn't write the story if the teacher was smart enough and had read that book i wrote my own story about john and mary and i turned it in and they'd stamp that boy that's good my sister come in one day and she did and she was running late and she said sam here's your here's your uh your book report i said okay thank you well see i'd let her write the book report and then i'd rewrite them okay you know and and and i'd rewrite it i didn't dare do it and that day i forgot and turned it in where she wrote it that old school teacher said i know what you've been doing said your sister's been writing these stories that's true because you see i know the end of the story john and mary lived happily ever after i know the end of the story now the bride of jesus christ this hunted and persecuted the prophet will the scene honey and persecute a little bride we'll go to meet the lord in the hour so why are we worried not worried happy not happy because everything's going wrong but happy to know we know the story of why it's going wrong you realize it's going wrong because you're here [Music] what's making the devil mad you're here he don't like you the surprise is we don't like him think about it you're dismissed one o'clock remember service starts one o'clock put the math back on no matter what
