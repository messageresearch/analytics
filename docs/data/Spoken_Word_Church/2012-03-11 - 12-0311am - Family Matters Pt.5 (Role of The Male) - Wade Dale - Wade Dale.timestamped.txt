[5:35] supposedly into another dimension amen
[5:41] maybe when we get in another dimension
[5:42] we won't have time changes we'll have to
[5:44] worry about
[5:46] right little donny
[5:47] that's right
[5:50] you know me i announced it at the office
[5:52] several times not someone else too my
[5:55] brother chris forgot something that's
[5:57] okay in october you can forget and all
[5:59] y'all that are late will be an hour
[6:00] early
[6:02] but when you do it this time makes you
[6:04] an hour late so but goodbye to the house
[6:07] of the lord we still have to go through
[6:08] time
[6:09] i'm still here so you love the lord
[6:12] had a good week
[6:14] today seems like a special day to me i
[6:15] don't know to you but
[6:16] this seems like a special day
[6:18] i was um texting bro tom ernest sent me
[6:21] a text this morning said to tell all of
[6:22] you hello and that he loved you and that
[6:25] uh
[6:26] that he said soon probably so that he's
[6:28] out in wichita his home church so you
[6:30] got your bibles let's go ahead and turn
[6:31] to first peter three
[6:35] and get started
[6:38] i didn't bring my diagon out this
[6:39] morning
[6:40] so we'll just read it out of the
[6:42] out of the regular scripture i think you
[6:44] kind of got the
[6:46] the gist of what the diagrap was saying
[6:48] the original
[6:49] being joint heirs instead of just heirs
[6:51] being joined heirs together of the grace
[6:53] of life and that's what we're going to
[6:54] talk about
[6:55] today
[6:56] but the role of the man
[6:58] in doing so
[7:01] there must be headship
[7:03] because we are sheep and we must be led
[7:05] there's got to be someone above us
[7:09] to lead us and guide us like the holy
[7:11] spirit is our god he's to lead us and
[7:13] guide us into all truth is that correct
[7:15] amen all right so let's bow our heads
[7:16] before we get started dear heavenly
[7:18] father we pray today lord that you would
[7:21] again come among us lord in a special
[7:22] way father not as a bystander but an
[7:24] active participant you take over this
[7:26] flesh lord and take over the ears and
[7:28] the eyes of the of the hearer than the
[7:30] seer lord that that we may see what's
[7:32] given to us in this endtime lord
[7:35] we've given we we've been given an
[7:37] opportunity to fulfill your word
[7:40] something that paul and a lot of many of
[7:42] those people those people in the old
[7:43] testament and even in the new testament
[7:46] could not do lord they could not
[7:48] completely
[7:49] take the whole word of god and break it
[7:51] down and and line it up lord where we
[7:53] line up with you
[7:55] but now in the end time you give us that
[7:57] opportunity you sent a prophet lord
[8:00] you sent us the word
[8:02] through that prophet to give us strength
[8:04] lord and to break these things down for
[8:06] us and we take his words and we read
[8:08] them father we know that that was you
[8:09] speaking to us lord so now i pray that
[8:12] as as we speak did it not be man's words
[8:15] or not be a a man's quote but let it be
[8:17] a living reality let it be something
[8:19] that we take home lord and and take part
[8:22] of father and if anything be said that
[8:24] that's not it's not smothered just
[8:27] smothered with the holy spirit lord let
[8:29] it be taken out of our
[8:30] life lord just let it be totally
[8:32] saturated in you lord when we do that
[8:34] then everything falls in line father we
[8:37] pray for the sick it's not here lord be
[8:39] with them and bless them be with the
[8:41] sickness here among us in the sanctuary
[8:43] that should take it away from them
[8:44] father as the word goes forth
[8:46] may you seek
[8:47] and heal and save the lost
[8:49] be with each one father take care of us
[8:51] lead us in guide us by your holy spirit
[8:53] we pray these things in jesus name amen
[8:56] first peter 3 chapter 1. likewise your
[8:59] wives be in subjection to your own
[9:01] husbands
[9:02] if any obey not the word they also may
[9:04] without the word be won by the
[9:06] conversation
[9:07] of the wives we'll get into that a
[9:09] little bit more when we talk about the
[9:11] wives but today is going to be the role
[9:13] of the male or the husband
[9:15] while they behold your chaste or clean
[9:17] conversation
[9:19] coupled with fear
[9:20] who's adorning let it not be that half
[9:22] of be that outward adorning of planting
[9:25] the hair and wearing of gold and putting
[9:26] on of apparel but let it be the hidden
[9:28] man of the heart in that which is not
[9:30] corruptable
[9:32] even the ornament that's what it is now
[9:34] see but let it not be let it be the
[9:37] hidden man of the heart
[9:39] in that which is not corruptable
[9:42] even the ornament what this is the part
[9:44] that's not corruptable
[9:46] the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[9:49] which is in the sight of god of great
[9:50] price
[9:52] for after this matter in the old time
[9:53] the holy women also who trusted in god
[9:56] adorned themselves being in subjection
[9:58] unto their own husbands even as sarah
[10:00] obeyed abraham calling him lord whose
[10:03] daughters you are
[10:04] as long as you do well there's a
[10:05] stipulation there we'll get into that
[10:07] when we get into the
[10:09] to the female part and are not afraid
[10:11] with any amazement he's taking fear out
[10:14] remember fear is what got us here
[10:16] likewise he husbands dwell with them
[10:18] according to knowledge
[10:20] giving honor and to the wife
[10:22] as unto the weaker vessel
[10:24] and as being
[10:26] joint heirs together of the grace of
[10:28] life
[10:29] that your prayers
[10:31] be not hindered and you may be seated in
[10:32] the lord at his blessing to the reading
[10:34] of the word
[10:37] now we come to the time now where we've
[10:39] we've got the uh
[10:41] the marriage part i hope you've really
[10:43] really enjoyed the marriage part now
[10:46] we're going to break it apart and when
[10:47] you break things apart it gets a little
[10:49] more touchy because you got to get down
[10:51] to where you live now you can kind of
[10:52] you can kind of hide behind the husband
[10:54] and wife roll because we're married
[10:57] we two are one you know amanda
[11:00] i'll hide behind him should you get
[11:02] behind me
[11:03] no
[11:04] we're gonna see today man you gotta be
[11:06] first
[11:07] you gotta be first in everything right
[11:10] you gotta be the first one not the first
[11:12] one that thinks of everything thank
[11:14] goodness
[11:14] because we're not infallible sisters
[11:16] today
[11:17] i'll promise you one thing you'll learn
[11:19] we're not infallible right but there's
[11:22] one thing that is infallible and that's
[11:24] the word of god amen if you take the
[11:26] word of god and use it as your head man
[11:30] coming down to the sisters if you stay
[11:32] in line stay in the line of the word
[11:34] then you will not ever fail
[11:36] all right because the words infallible
[11:38] all right so now
[11:40] just to review a few minutes
[11:43] uh you can go ahead and pull that quote
[11:44] up if you want to uh the first one
[11:47] but talking about three-dimensional love
[11:48] everybody understand that we you there's
[11:50] two dimensions in the world that love
[11:52] and that's your body and your spirit
[11:54] but if you don't have that inside of the
[11:56] inside
[11:57] that third round that soul where you can
[11:59] connect
[12:00] now we're not soul mating right
[12:03] now i don't agree with that i don't
[12:05] think that you but still
[12:07] but still in every error there's truth
[12:12] somewhere in there in error there is
[12:13] truth
[12:14] because if you truly are one you're not
[12:17] the same soul we know that
[12:19] but when we come back to eternity or if
[12:22] you have the new birth and i have the
[12:23] new birth then you do have the same soul
[12:28] all right
[12:29] okay so we can safely say we're not soul
[12:32] mating down here but we can safely say
[12:34] that god's doing it all right man
[12:36] now when god put something together
[12:38] that's why the bible says that's why
[12:39] when jesus come he said
[12:41] whatever man puts together may not be
[12:44] right
[12:44] he said but whatever god puts together
[12:47] let no man try to take it
[12:49] exactly let no man try to take it away
[12:52] in other words why he's wanting to put
[12:53] it together is he not perfect
[12:56] he's perfect when he puts something
[12:57] together all right so when you're
[12:59] together as one in christ then then
[13:02] you're perfect we've got to understand
[13:03] that even our role of husband and wife
[13:05] that we saw all of our fallacies and all
[13:07] the things that we did wrong and then
[13:09] the things that we did right
[13:11] we still see that
[13:12] as human beings
[13:15] we're wrong
[13:16] most of the time
[13:18] as human beings right but like i said
[13:20] before you're going to see today if
[13:22] everybody will take their position
[13:26] you say oh my position is way on up here
[13:28] well prove it yeah
[13:31] pretty much now i'm not saying that back
[13:32] i'm not saying that boastfully i'm
[13:34] saying we gotta prove it
[13:37] we gotta prove it right
[13:38] but we gotta start in these primary
[13:41] things if you can't be the head of your
[13:42] own house
[13:44] now before we get started
[13:47] like i said the other day some of you
[13:49] don't have your wives here some of you
[13:50] don't have your husbands here
[13:52] i am these quotes i took off not
[13:55] singling out any one person
[13:57] okay now i'd be lying and standing here
[14:00] and i'd leave this pulpit but i i didn't
[14:02] have one person in mind but i know a lot
[14:04] of you don't have your spouse here
[14:07] but i'm going to read to you what
[14:08] brother brown said
[14:09] i'll let him tell you then you can talk
[14:11] to him about it
[14:13] all right i'm just going to put you the
[14:15] quote down and i'm not going to you know
[14:16] skewer it or or put my own
[14:19] interpretation in it i'm going to read
[14:21] you what
[14:22] what it says so if you look at this one
[14:26] remember
[14:28] never argue
[14:29] have respect for each other
[14:31] all right i thank you man's filter this
[14:33] is the last one we read last sunday
[14:35] so in the review of what we're doing
[14:37] here
[14:39] listen
[14:40] over the grace of god that he will give
[14:42] us understanding of such great mysteries
[14:45] as paul spoke here further on down in
[14:47] ephesians
[14:48] speaking of the husband and wife
[14:50] saying said this is a mystery
[14:54] what is a mystery
[14:57] he just tells you right
[14:59] how the woman should be in respects to
[15:01] their husband right
[15:02] great mystery
[15:05] even the second place i believe it is
[15:06] the entire scripture that reverence was
[15:08] ever spoken to
[15:09] said the woman seeing she reverts her
[15:11] husband
[15:12] reverence her husband then a husband
[15:14] ought to live such a life now that's
[15:15] what we're going to talk about today the
[15:17] role of the man
[15:18] seeing she reverence her husband
[15:20] reverence her husband then a husband
[15:21] ought to live such a life before his
[15:23] wife that his wife could reverence him
[15:26] as a son of god man because if you don't
[15:28] she's not right and you know what if you
[15:31] don't
[15:32] and she's trying to serve god
[15:35] you're out of the picture
[15:37] i'll read that to you just a little bit
[15:38] because if you tell her to do something
[15:39] contrary to the word of god
[15:41] your husband tells you something
[15:42] contrary the word of god he's not your
[15:44] head anymore exactly but now brother ram
[15:46] does tell you
[15:48] to still respect the man because that's
[15:49] your husband that's the man you marry
[15:52] all right
[15:53] and if and if he doesn't live that kind
[15:55] of life well then of course she wouldn't
[15:57] reverence him because she knows what
[15:59] he's made of
[16:00] but when it is a man that is a reverent
[16:03] man
[16:04] reverend and clean with his wife and
[16:05] before his family a real servant of god
[16:08] then the woman children and all women
[16:09] children of all should respect that
[16:11] servant of god
[16:12] with
[16:14] reverence and everybody says amen
[16:16] is that right
[16:18] now
[16:19] go to the genesis 3 16 this is why
[16:23] that we have this situation we talked
[16:24] about something last sunday but genesis
[16:27] 3 16 until the woman he said i will
[16:29] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[16:31] conception and sorrow thou shalt bring
[16:33] forth children
[16:34] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[16:37] and he shall rule over thee amen all
[16:39] right so there's where your double
[16:41] covenant comes in
[16:42] where man is the ruler now over
[16:46] the
[16:46] woman or the weaker vessel amen thy
[16:49] desire shall be to thy husband
[16:52] and he shall rule over thee all right
[16:56] now under the double covenant this is
[16:58] what we're under right now we're under
[16:59] that covenant where man is the ruler
[17:01] right he's the head he's the head ship
[17:04] sisters whether you like it or not i'm
[17:05] going to read some quotes that that
[17:08] that you may not agree with but
[17:10] you're disagreeing with the prophet
[17:11] you're not disagreeing with me
[17:12] first corinthians 11
[17:15] 3
[17:17] but i would have you know that the head
[17:18] of every man is christ that's the first
[17:20] thing
[17:23] that's the first thing
[17:26] there's that
[17:28] third dimension
[17:30] yeah because without god in that in that
[17:33] soul
[17:35] who's your head
[17:38] satan's your head
[17:39] because you're only you're only two
[17:41] powers amen
[17:43] the head of every man is christ
[17:45] and the head of the woman is the man
[17:48] and the head of christ is god so we see
[17:50] it every bit come down through there
[17:51] christ when he was on earth he had honor
[17:54] to his father which was in heaven is
[17:55] that correct
[17:56] he knew the one inside of him was
[17:58] greater than this one right here than
[17:59] his flesh man all right he wasn't two
[18:01] people he was one god
[18:03] but he also knew that one inside of him
[18:05] was the one that ruled everything
[18:07] all right is that correct that's one
[18:09] that don't bother me that's one true
[18:10] living god because you know what this is
[18:12] going to get back to when you see god
[18:15] and adam and eve in the garden if you
[18:17] were god standing looking at god
[18:20] the way i explained it yeah he see one
[18:22] that's right
[18:24] you see three right right
[18:26] you see one if we were to look and say
[18:28] well no no there's god and adam and eve
[18:30] no there's god and god made flesh in
[18:32] another form right
[18:35] and then god made flesh in another form
[18:36] amen and then god made flesh another
[18:38] form but what happened satan got to eve
[18:41] and it stopped that exactly right
[18:44] instead of it being god made manifest in
[18:45] another form dick addison sanger dale
[18:48] et cetera et cetera et cetera
[18:51] saying stopped it right right
[18:53] then we had to wait a little while right
[18:56] we had a little wait a little while till
[18:57] that head could come back amen right
[19:00] he didn't leave we're using these words
[19:02] for our own good
[19:04] god never left right yeah we left him
[19:07] right exactly so he couldn't get to us
[19:09] that fellowship
[19:10] was broken by what fear right
[19:14] adam said i'm afraid
[19:16] well then god said i'll put enmity
[19:19] i'll put a division between me and you
[19:21] in other words you're not going to see
[19:23] me like you should until i come back
[19:26] and i come back in flesh
[19:28] and identify who i am he said if you see
[19:31] me you see the father so he was
[19:32] identifying the father right that was in
[19:35] him
[19:36] right
[19:37] then he's telling us now
[19:39] in corinthians which the corinthians had
[19:42] a problem right ephesians didn't have no
[19:44] problem right
[19:45] they were a mature group of people
[19:47] but the corinthians always had problems
[19:50] with marriage and divorce yeah so here
[19:52] is paul coming in in verse 3 of chapter
[19:55] 11. he said would i have you know that
[19:57] the head of every man is christ starting
[19:59] right there
[20:01] right
[20:02] then or and or even the head of the
[20:04] woman is the man
[20:07] and the head of christ is god right
[20:11] so guys
[20:13] if you're born again
[20:16] you're in the most godly position you
[20:18] can be in according to the scripture
[20:20] right i said according to what you can
[20:22] be in right right
[20:24] excuse me
[20:26] you want to hear that one more time
[20:28] man if you're born again
[20:30] you're in the most godly position
[20:32] you'll ever be in if you stay a man be a
[20:35] man be a husband be a father
[20:37] you are in the
[20:39] position
[20:40] and sisters you're going to see that
[20:42] we're going to talk about that
[20:42] revelation with the sisters where paul
[20:44] said this is a revelation right that a
[20:46] woman reverence her husband well
[20:49] let's go spiritual let the bride
[20:50] reverence christ amen
[20:52] same thing okay you can't separate it
[20:54] but we gotta separate it to get the role
[20:56] of the man
[20:57] under the double covenant we gotta get
[20:59] the role of the man where the man
[21:01] is the one and i'm going to read you
[21:03] some
[21:04] some things that brother brown said
[21:07] that'll shock you maybe
[21:09] but let's go to ephesians 5 and 23.
[21:15] now what is ephesians
[21:17] paul doesn't have to explain so much to
[21:20] the ephesians right exactly because they
[21:21] understood
[21:23] just like we should understand today
[21:26] excuse me
[21:28] my brother andre was saying you know we
[21:30] we've
[21:31] we've got it all here brother claude you
[21:33] know we we i don't say we got it all but
[21:35] i'm saying every revelation has ever
[21:36] been preached in this message have been
[21:38] preached from here
[21:39] so being preached from here
[21:41] then if you didn't accept it you've come
[21:44] out from under your headship that's
[21:46] right
[21:48] let's get back lined up under our
[21:49] headship amen and our headship is christ
[21:52] for the husband is the head of the wife
[21:56] even as christ is the head of the church
[21:59] and he is the savior
[22:01] of the body
[22:03] all right now
[22:04] also but now look the husband
[22:07] can't save
[22:09] his wife
[22:13] right if she's lost he can't save her
[22:15] right right but let's look at that a
[22:17] little deeper
[22:19] if she's a christian and he's a
[22:21] christian
[22:23] she can be saved by the husband i'm not
[22:26] talking about saved and baptizing into
[22:28] the body see i'm talking i'm getting
[22:30] double double scripture here
[22:32] he is the savior of her body right
[22:36] you're the savior of your wife's body
[22:38] right because she can't be circumcised
[22:41] you're circumcised and she's under you
[22:42] that was in the old testament but in the
[22:44] new testament we are all under
[22:45] circumcision but still
[22:46] i'm gonna read you some quotes where
[22:48] she'll never have to give an account for
[22:50] us
[22:50] but we're gonna have to give an account
[22:52] for her
[22:53] so if we can bring her back under that
[22:54] headship savior of the body
[22:57] everybody understands that too far out
[22:59] i don't think so because we're supposed
[23:01] to be one flesh right all right
[23:04] now listen to this
[23:08] did we did you put this up brother joe
[23:10] the note yeah
[23:12] listen the man needs to understand
[23:14] that's what we're going to talk about
[23:15] today
[23:16] both services are going to be on the man
[23:17] so the females you can come back this
[23:19] afternoon you still beat them we're
[23:20] still beating on the mail
[23:22] a man needs to understand his role i
[23:24] looked at her a few minutes ago and i
[23:25] thought man they either didn't turn
[23:26] their clock forward or
[23:28] or uh
[23:29] everybody decided to go fishing but gary
[23:31] crash was here so i know you weren't
[23:33] using this boat
[23:36] a man needs to understand his role
[23:39] so he can know how to act and react to
[23:42] situations in a marriage
[23:43] that's your position man
[23:48] and be obedient to that position
[23:53] the female should also understand what
[23:55] the male's role is so she can help him
[23:58] right
[23:59] you're not gonna pull apart right
[24:01] so if today if you sisters will listen
[24:05] let god and let the prophet and the
[24:07] scriptures
[24:09] tell you what you're supposed to be
[24:10] looking for
[24:11] so even though you some of you young
[24:13] ladies that are not married
[24:15] are looking or maybe on the internet
[24:17] that's looking this will help you to
[24:20] find somebody that maybe is already in
[24:22] that position and thank god because boy
[24:24] your life will be a whole lot easier oh
[24:25] yeah right
[24:26] right
[24:28] i said a whole lot easier i didn't say
[24:29] easy
[24:30] i said a whole lot easier
[24:32] the female should also understand what
[24:35] the male's role is so she can help him
[24:37] she's supposed to be to help me right
[24:38] right what one given to help all right
[24:41] fulfill his role
[24:44] you take to help me out so she can help
[24:46] him fulfill his role according to god's
[24:48] word
[24:49] because if sisters if you rule the house
[24:52] you have not
[24:53] you have not only dishonored yourself
[24:55] you've dishonored your head right now
[24:57] you've took him out of his position
[24:59] you took him out
[25:01] but man if you know what you're supposed
[25:03] to do and you let her take him out
[25:05] it's doubly on you
[25:10] the man
[25:12] can put the woman back in line
[25:15] but the man has to put the man back in
[25:16] line
[25:17] a woman can't put the man back in line
[25:20] everybody understand that right
[25:22] i mean you can get all
[25:24] jumbled up there but the man is the head
[25:27] he's the one that's going to put his
[25:28] self in christ should put him in line
[25:31] brothers we got to listen to god
[25:33] we got to listen to god and in the
[25:35] situation the things we do we got to
[25:37] listen to god and do the godly things to
[25:39] bring our sisters maybe that are not in
[25:41] the sanctuary with us or our brothers to
[25:43] bring them under that but how are we
[25:45] going to do it if we don't understand
[25:46] our role right
[25:50] so he can know how to act and react to
[25:52] situations in a marriage i know we've
[25:54] all reacted wrong yeah right there man
[25:59] to into a lot of situations we've
[26:00] reacted wrong why
[26:03] that's what i said you know a couple of
[26:05] sermons ago
[26:06] pray before you fight
[26:10] that's right then fight nice
[26:13] yeah
[26:14] but i always told the kids you don't
[26:15] quit fighting i said fight nice
[26:21] but look man be obedient to that
[26:24] position right
[26:26] you're not this great big king ruler
[26:28] that has nobody over you
[26:31] because right there with you is the king
[26:33] of kings amen
[26:34] he's the ruler
[26:36] he's the one that rules but then the
[26:38] female should understand though that
[26:40] through you
[26:41] man through you
[26:44] you can be put in line through the man
[26:47] the woman can be put in line and be
[26:49] under subjection and do the right thing
[26:50] for god everybody understand that say
[26:52] amen amen
[26:54] all right now
[26:56] a few things i want to say that i didn't
[26:57] have that i didn't write down but we
[27:00] need to sisters you need to compliment
[27:02] him
[27:03] you're you're not an accessory like a
[27:05] purse
[27:07] or an accessory like a a new belt or a
[27:09] wallet or something no your your
[27:12] june is me mate manifest in another form
[27:14] right amen but it is another form and
[27:17] it's another form that you've got to
[27:19] deal with right she's not made like you
[27:22] man's made masculine we're made to think
[27:24] things out we're made to do you know do
[27:26] different things we're we're supposed to
[27:28] you know build the nest
[27:30] not sitting on the eggs
[27:32] right
[27:33] right i know
[27:35] i don't know
[27:41] there are some birds
[27:43] eagles certain things that sit on the
[27:45] nest
[27:48] but in most cases
[27:52] men are not supposed to have babies
[27:56] so that's what the female female is more
[27:58] of a homebody right she's more the
[28:00] emotional she's more of the of the
[28:03] you know you say well we're going to go
[28:04] out and eat you know we're going to go
[28:05] out and eat and we're going you know i
[28:08] come in i i brought the i brought the
[28:10] money in this week and we got some extra
[28:12] money we're going to go out and eat
[28:14] she's like honey
[28:17] we ain't got enough money to go out
[28:18] neither or i'm not hungry or something
[28:20] you gotta agree
[28:21] compliment him
[28:23] say hey i appreciate that
[28:25] but now remember one thing
[28:29] you got to support him
[28:32] yeah
[28:34] you know what support me
[28:36] that's like you got an army out here
[28:38] fighting
[28:40] you got to bring up the support
[28:42] you got to support that man but now look
[28:45] you said well i wouldn't support my man
[28:46] well you know what he may not be in his
[28:48] position yet
[28:49] or you may not be in your position yet
[28:52] but we got to understand our position
[28:55] you've got to be supportive right
[28:59] whatever it is
[29:01] sarah
[29:03] supported abraham amen
[29:06] in two things that seemingly we thought
[29:08] was wrong
[29:13] i'm fixing to give my wife to a king
[29:16] telling you're my sister
[29:19] and she said
[29:20] okay she must have no they've got her
[29:23] ready
[29:25] right read your bible they got her ready
[29:28] she went standing in there fussing and
[29:29] throwing us flinging hair pins and
[29:31] no
[29:32] she was under subjection and that's why
[29:34] she called abraham lord because she
[29:36] trusted him there must have been
[29:37] something there yeah she trusted god
[29:40] enough to believe that abraham was doing
[29:41] the right thing and it's for our example
[29:43] in the end time all right that we are
[29:46] sarah we're supposed to to be like that
[29:48] to abraham but abraham she called him
[29:50] lord or ownership in other words sarah
[29:53] was saying whatever this is he still
[29:55] owns me he's my ruler we took each other
[29:58] and he's my ruler he's my owner
[30:00] he owns me not a slave but he owns me
[30:03] all right
[30:05] and we'll read we'll see in just a
[30:06] little while that
[30:07] that god didn't kill sarah
[30:10] because of abraham amen right
[30:12] god couldn't go and get sarah
[30:15] he had to go through abraham to get to
[30:16] sarah that's why i said if you've got
[30:17] your head shipped right
[30:19] christ your head man you're the head of
[30:22] the female or your wife
[30:25] i'm going to use wife because
[30:27] you can't be headship over women right
[30:29] right okay for your wife all right
[30:32] then what's going to happen is
[30:34] then there you go savior of the body
[30:37] god
[30:38] has got to
[30:39] look at
[30:41] abraham
[30:43] before he looked at sarah
[30:45] he saw a righteous abraham
[30:49] and forgave sarah because brother rabbi
[30:51] said you were reading them in he
[30:53] couldn't touch sarah because she was
[30:54] part of abraham amen
[30:56] and they weren't
[30:58] not like adam and eve they weren't
[31:01] they were not in other words sarah
[31:03] didn't come out of abraham but under all
[31:05] the
[31:06] the the word of god and what god put
[31:08] together let no man take asunder they
[31:10] were so much one
[31:12] that god couldn't destroy sarah without
[31:14] destroying abraham amen all right now
[31:16] what about that today he said oh that's
[31:18] back in the old testament
[31:21] did we tear that page out and throw it
[31:23] out
[31:24] that's come to here
[31:26] let's come to this day to this age all
[31:28] right
[31:29] so let's go and pull up quote number one
[31:33] which is titan church age
[31:35] now this is going to kind of
[31:37] put it all in perspective
[31:40] now a woman is not meant to have an iron
[31:42] disposition
[31:43] she is according to the holy scripture
[31:45] to be submissive to the male
[31:48] excuse me that is commanded of her
[31:52] woman who is truly female all female
[31:54] will be of that disposition
[31:57] not a doormat
[31:58] no real male makes a female a doormat
[32:01] right but she will want
[32:03] to be under authority and not rule over
[32:06] the mail
[32:08] because i'm going to tell you something
[32:10] just a few minutes
[32:11] i'm going to show
[32:12] you you females
[32:16] are
[32:17] sisters
[32:19] you don't have to worry about getting a
[32:20] sermon together you don't have to worry
[32:23] about the souls of all these people in
[32:24] this church
[32:25] no you got to worry about your home
[32:28] right
[32:30] i listen
[32:32] but she will want to be under authority
[32:34] and not rule over the mail for he is the
[32:37] head of the house
[32:38] if she breaks that image that god made
[32:40] for her she is perverted i didn't say
[32:43] that he did
[32:44] any male that lets the woman take
[32:46] authority
[32:48] has also broken that image and he is
[32:50] perverted
[32:51] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[32:53] which pertains to a man or cut her hair
[32:55] right she has never wear a garment
[32:56] that's pertaining to a male or cut her
[32:58] hair and i know this is closing on
[32:59] holding this but he put it in here i
[33:00] didn't
[33:01] when she does she is intruding into the
[33:04] male domain
[33:06] taking authority and perverting herself
[33:08] right
[33:11] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[33:12] which is command she must not do she
[33:14] shows what spirit she is being a
[33:17] dominating female is antichrist
[33:20] and the seeds of the roman catholic
[33:22] church are in her though she may deny
[33:24] this ever so vehemently
[33:28] but when it comes to the word
[33:30] let god be true in their words man be a
[33:32] lie right amen all right let's go to
[33:34] number two
[33:38] is your life worthy of the gospel
[33:40] may you men that's got your wives and
[33:42] let them be the boss of the house and
[33:43] lead you around may the god of heaven
[33:46] give you grace to set your foot down and
[33:47] bring that woman back to her right mind
[33:49] again she must be crazy
[33:55] i'm going to read that again
[33:59] that's what he said
[34:02] yeah
[34:03] and realize that that's your place in
[34:05] christ
[34:06] right not a boss
[34:09] now but you are the head of the house
[34:11] remember she's not even in the original
[34:14] creation she's only a byproduct we went
[34:16] through that last week she only
[34:18] byproduct of you
[34:22] you see how personal that is right
[34:24] you don't know about adam and eve
[34:26] she's a byproduct of you
[34:29] give by god to you to take care of you
[34:32] what to be
[34:35] your support
[34:37] or your
[34:40] accessory
[34:41] or compliment you but remember
[34:44] we're not infallible
[34:46] we do make mistakes right
[34:50] but if we're god led
[34:53] god's going to keep us in line
[34:55] hey god whips us
[34:57] amen god whips us
[34:59] i actually whip this morning with you
[35:02] cause we're the first partaker i'll read
[35:03] that in just a few minutes
[35:05] she's only a byproduct of you give by
[35:07] god to you to take care of you to keep
[35:10] your clothes clean and fix your meals
[35:11] and so forth she's not your dictator
[35:14] you american women run around with a gob
[35:16] of pain on your face and your nose up in
[35:18] the air
[35:19] it rained and drown you yeah
[35:21] didn't think you're some sort of a
[35:23] dictator
[35:24] you are to assist him but not to a real
[35:27] son of god
[35:29] you are to a but not to a real son
[35:32] of god right
[35:34] all right number three
[35:37] just one more time lord
[35:38] let me say this my friend
[35:40] you better destroy your enemy before
[35:42] your enemy destroys you bring back the
[35:44] old-fashioned prayer meeting
[35:46] old-fashioned repentance when they
[35:48] stayed to the altar until they were dead
[35:50] and finished with sin you never seen a
[35:52] woman go to the altar and die out the
[35:53] sin the next day come back with bob hair
[35:55] paint her face there's no such the holy
[35:58] spirit teaches
[35:59] nature does nature of the holy spirit
[36:02] you've never seen women going out and
[36:04] dressing sexy come in and try to cover
[36:05] themselves up you never seen a man that
[36:07] was afraid to stand up and afraid his
[36:09] little wife would leave him or something
[36:10] another because he took the initiative
[36:14] there's a word we're going to deal with
[36:16] he took the initiative
[36:18] well
[36:19] man were man in them in them days they
[36:21] spoke they were man they were they
[36:23] governed their house they were the head
[36:24] of house but this fancy
[36:26] america
[36:28] all right let's go to second timothy two
[36:34] we're going to talk about the head of
[36:35] the house
[36:36] remember what i said about initiative
[36:40] this is where we're going to start now
[36:41] this is where
[36:42] your sisters i want you to understand
[36:44] this is what god is wanting us to do
[36:46] as men as head of the house this is what
[36:49] we're supposed to do
[36:51] the husband that laboreth that's the th
[36:54] on the end of that so if you're married
[36:55] you're going to be laboring
[36:57] every day
[36:59] for years
[37:02] a long time anyway
[37:03] the husband that laboreth must be first
[37:06] partaker of the fruits
[37:08] consider what i say paul said the lord
[37:12] give the understanding in all things
[37:14] right okay
[37:15] so men the husband
[37:17] we're the first partakers of the fruit
[37:19] we are to be
[37:21] the head
[37:22] of the house
[37:24] now i've got the definition of head on
[37:25] here but they don't right there but you
[37:26] pull up the next one if you want to
[37:29] head beans top or beginning
[37:32] the head of the chattahoochee is where
[37:33] the chattahoochee river begins that's
[37:35] the head the headwaters all right so
[37:37] it's too it's to it's at the top or the
[37:40] beginning but now look brother brown
[37:42] said you got to take the initiative
[37:45] initiate
[37:46] to instruct in the principle of
[37:49] something to start
[37:52] brothers
[37:54] to start
[37:55] to initiate
[37:58] to
[37:59] take the initiative
[38:02] whatever is needed in this relationship
[38:04] should be started by the male or the
[38:07] husband
[38:08] whatever is needed in this relationship
[38:11] should be started by the male or the
[38:13] husband
[38:15] you're going to see we're not going to
[38:16] talk about much about dating
[38:19] but brother branham hated it that the
[38:21] women were calling to me the boys and
[38:23] things like that he hated that because
[38:26] why that took the man out from under the
[38:27] roll it's put the woman up as the head
[38:30] calling the boys i know what happened
[38:31] this day and age but it didn't change i
[38:33] mean god hadn't changed
[38:36] the man's the male should call the
[38:37] female
[38:39] whatever is needed in this relationship
[38:41] should be started by the male or the
[38:43] husband his role is to initiate whatever
[38:46] is needed
[38:47] to line up with the word of god
[38:49] amen
[38:50] amen
[38:51] his role is to initiate
[38:54] start be the first one be at the
[38:57] beginning glory
[38:59] his role is to initiate whatever is
[39:02] needed to line up with the word of god
[39:05] now let's go to number four
[39:07] quote number four
[39:10] excuse me
[39:13] let's read the whole quote oh my poor
[39:15] dejected friend
[39:17] the devil might have took you sister out
[39:19] yonder to a place where you never do
[39:21] desire to let your hair grow
[39:23] might get you the place where you think
[39:24] that some pastor is nonsense when he's
[39:26] preaching you pure holiness the way you
[39:28] should dress some of you man out there
[39:30] that goes around and does these things
[39:32] you ought not to do
[39:33] and you men that let your wife do a
[39:35] thing like that and smoke cigarettes i
[39:36] got a little respect for you even as a
[39:38] man now that's exactly right you know a
[39:41] man's the head of the house
[39:43] as long as he takes his place
[39:47] you see what the prophet said as long as
[39:49] he takes his place
[39:51] but i
[39:52] but we i i don't i like to see a man a
[39:55] man a man's not judged by how many
[39:57] muscles he's got that's a beast a man's
[39:59] not judged by the brony muscles but he's
[40:01] judged by the bags and the knees of his
[40:03] pants
[40:04] where he's been praying that's what
[40:06] takes a man
[40:07] let's go to the next one
[40:10] number five expectation
[40:16] let's go through the
[40:18] underlying part

[40:43] them and get to bed
[40:44] no sir stay there with god oh my that's
[40:47] desperation but you know what to make a
[40:49] home desperate the male
[40:52] the husband
[40:54] must
[40:55] initiate
[40:57] we're the stronger women sorry we are
[41:00] the stronger you're the weaker vessel
[41:02] we're supposed to see things first now
[41:05] that doesn't mean in human terms and
[41:07] human things right
[41:08] you women sometimes are more you know uh
[41:11] thoughtful about
[41:13] even praying for people i guess more
[41:14] than males because you have more
[41:16] feelings involved
[41:17] but i know a lot of times and i've seen
[41:20] it happen in in dad's life and i'm gonna
[41:23] go ahead and say this but my mom's not
[41:25] here but a lot of things mom would
[41:27] question
[41:29] but dad wouldn't give an answer
[41:31] why did you do this why did that happen
[41:33] and jim said why
[41:35] we're waiting on god
[41:37] we're waiting on a clear-cut answer from
[41:39] god
[41:41] whether your opinion is right or not at
[41:43] the time
[41:45] we still got to wait on god
[41:47] now god listens to you sister sure if
[41:50] you don't cut your hair
[41:52] because if you cut your hair he's not
[41:53] listening to you
[41:55] right
[41:57] so
[41:59] just be
[42:00] patient
[42:02] you're supposed to be reverent to the
[42:04] man
[42:05] right man not like um
[42:08] dave ramsey says the last thing a man
[42:11] needs that's down on his luck is a
[42:13] barking chihuahua dog chewing on his
[42:15] ankles
[42:18] so
[42:20] same way in the gospel
[42:22] no those little yappings you're all a
[42:24] dog napping at your ankles
[42:27] when when you're waiting on something
[42:28] from god now it says if
[42:33] you're in that position right
[42:35] that's the question you've got to ask
[42:37] yourself
[42:38] first husbands am i in this position if
[42:40] i am this is what we're going to do amen
[42:43] if not then you get in your position you
[42:46] seek god
[42:47] for answers to your questions all right
[42:49] let's go to the next one
[42:53] number six
[42:54] greater than solomon is here in 1963 and
[42:56] you men that can't stop talking and
[42:58] looking at women and morally dressed the
[43:00] idols of the day
[43:01] you man that haven't got enough real
[43:03] grace in your heart to make your wife
[43:05] and kids quit doing such a thing as that
[43:07] the love of god isn't anchored in your
[43:09] heart
[43:10] don't be called the son of god you're
[43:12] still in sodom a man that can't take
[43:14] over his house
[43:16] god ordained him to do yeah
[43:19] and you deacons it's mad two or three
[43:20] times of course we don't have that
[43:21] problem here we praise the lord
[43:24] and you men that run out on your wives
[43:25] and try to hold your profession
[43:28] you women that cross the other way
[43:30] no where's the head yeah you women who's
[43:33] trying to be the head that's what he's
[43:34] saying you women that cross the other
[43:35] way you people that hit behind the cloak
[43:37] of the church
[43:40] shame on you he said yeah
[43:42] shame on you
[43:44] if you don't belong to your crew you
[43:45] have nothing to do with him shame on you
[43:47] shame on your men that won't do what
[43:52] you got to have grace in your heart to
[43:53] make your wife and kids quit doing such
[43:55] a thing as that what dressing immorally
[43:58] that's what he's talking about
[44:00] and the men and the men and the boys
[44:02] gawking at the women dressy morally
[44:05] if he would look that in this day in
[44:06] time he'd he would have probably been
[44:08] like uh
[44:10] like somebody was saying one time said
[44:11] lord just put my eyes out
[44:13] yeah you know so i don't see any of it
[44:17] but never where you look in this damn
[44:18] time it's there
[44:19] so let's go to the next one number seven
[44:22] identifications
[44:25] now if you find your place sister
[44:27] don't let don't let me hurt you or
[44:29] brother
[44:31] but you'll find your place in a word as
[44:33] a christian
[44:35] not what the creed said
[44:36] that's down here in this lower cannon
[44:38] fodder
[44:40] that's going to be destroyed right so
[44:42] that's nobody that's born again
[44:44] everybody's not born against cannon
[44:45] fodder right sorry that's what he said
[44:48] your cannon fodder because you're going
[44:49] to be here when he's talking about
[44:51] you're still going to be here when the
[44:52] destruction happens
[44:53] correct
[44:55] see you find your place as a christian
[44:57] because your character is molded as
[45:00] christ amen you are zoe
[45:04] the same as he was zoey amen
[45:08] amen if you're born again today you're
[45:10] as much as zoe is the zoe that's
[45:12] your head
[45:14] christ
[45:16] then if the bible said for a woman not
[45:17] to cut her hair how can you do it right
[45:19] you say a man to be a rule of the house
[45:22] how can you women be
[45:23] what's the matter with you men that sons
[45:25] of god see see you don't find your place
[45:28] see we're wanting to be placed all up in
[45:30] this headstone and we're wanting to have
[45:32] all these places up here up here in the
[45:34] sky
[45:36] have we got our place at home yeah
[45:39] if you say no
[45:41] if you say no don't talk about the other
[45:44] things
[45:45] what brother brown said he said you
[45:46] start climbing up here and he said you
[45:48] think well i'll just have godliness
[45:50] what'd he say
[45:51] you'll fall yeah
[45:53] problem people you'll fall
[45:55] i didn't say that brother brown said
[45:57] that
[45:59] let's read the rest of that you're
[46:00] invited to take come and take his
[46:03] character by having his character in you
[46:05] it mows you into the same mind that he
[46:07] was
[46:08] and his mind was always to do what the
[46:11] father had ordained him to do amen
[46:13] always he said i do always that what the
[46:16] father tells me right
[46:18] let me go one more quote and then i'll
[46:20] uh make a comment
[46:24] this is the token
[46:26] now listen to this
[46:30] they should love one another believers
[46:31] should separate themselves from the
[46:33] world
[46:34] don't just take it now lightly now you
[46:36] people that's listening to this
[46:38] on tape
[46:39] you women you men you listen a minute if
[46:41] you ever believe me you believe it now
[46:43] right it's time for to quit fussing with
[46:46] one another believe the message of the
[46:48] bible believe christ
[46:51] love and honor and respect one another
[46:54] man respect your wife
[46:57] you respect your home
[46:59] bring your home together because
[47:00] remember now what's he talking about
[47:02] what was the token
[47:03] the blood on the doorpost was not just
[47:05] for the mail
[47:07] it was for everyone in his household but
[47:09] the male had to put it on there
[47:12] first partaker
[47:14] if he was lazy and didn't do it it
[47:16] wasn't just him it was his family was
[47:18] cursed right because the firstborn died
[47:21] right right and you gotta remember if he
[47:22] was the firstborn from his mother and
[47:24] father he died
[47:25] yeah right right it wasn't just the
[47:27] father was exempt and all of us know if
[47:29] he was the firstborn standing there he
[47:30] died
[47:33] man respect your wives you respect your
[47:34] home
[47:35] bring your home together because
[47:37] remember this lamb was for the home
[47:40] not just one but the whole home too had
[47:43] to be brought
[47:44] everything had to be brought in
[47:47] we should love each other and believers
[47:49] should separate themselves from the
[47:50] world you remember brother around i'm
[47:52] telling the story about the the kid you
[47:54] know walking up to the to the dad inside
[47:56] the house there that night at the of the
[47:58] passover and uh
[48:01] he said that is everything all right he
[48:02] said son everything's all right that's
[48:04] right
[48:04] daddy are you sure everything's all
[48:06] right yeah everything's all right now if
[48:08] he was a dilatory dad and he said yeah
[48:10] everything's all right he didn't put the
[48:11] blood on him and he didn't get his put
[48:13] into his position then his children died
[48:16] and if he was the firstborn he died
[48:18] right and he didn't say okay son why
[48:20] don't you go peek outside
[48:23] and see what's going on no he was the
[48:25] head they come and talk to him
[48:27] he was the one that was responsible for
[48:30] that family and husbands
[48:33] you are responsible for your wives
[48:35] all right so don't think we can sit back
[48:37] and and you know sit back in our easy
[48:40] chairs and say well let's god if we get
[48:42] them lined up no what i'm trying to tell
[48:44] you today you gotta line up first right
[48:47] amen man
[48:49] initiative
[48:51] right
[48:52] you take the initiative she is naturally
[48:55] a follower right sisters
[48:56] you'll naturally follow somebody you
[48:58] trust right because you're feeling your
[49:00] emotion you'll follow something you
[49:02] trust
[49:03] all right so if they can't trust in you
[49:06] brothers
[49:08] you're not in your position
[49:10] so forget about that position right
[49:12] you'll never get to that position until
[49:14] you get to your own position in your
[49:15] house right all right
[49:18] now let me make a comment before we go
[49:19] to governor
[49:22] to initiate or to take the initiative
[49:25] i'll give you an example brother joe
[49:27] canada
[49:29] sitting in the back back there he's the
[49:30] one that does all of our computers and
[49:32] he a lot of times he doesn't get to
[49:33] participate out here in the in the
[49:35] service but
[49:37] he is a man that i respect
[49:39] because he takes his children
[49:41] and what does he do
[49:43] he teaches them he started to teach his
[49:46] children about god is that right that
[49:48] writes this phrasal verb he started
[49:50] teaching his children he took the
[49:51] initiative
[49:52] why he was the head
[49:55] he took the initiative to start a little
[49:57] bible study
[49:58] and those two kids probably know more
[50:00] about the bible than i do that's why we
[50:02] don't let them play bible trivia right
[50:05] on sunday afternoon we start playing a
[50:07] little bible trivia and
[50:09] sometimes you know and sometimes you
[50:10] ain't got a clue right through
[50:12] so-and-so's brother of half-brother of
[50:14] so-and-so and his name's about that long
[50:16] but
[50:17] but as far as the basics of starting
[50:19] something brother josh felt led right
[50:23] see
[50:24] husbands you got to be led yeah you got
[50:27] god's already took the initiative
[50:29] this is this big word right here this
[50:31] eternal word of god he's already wrote
[50:33] down what we got to do
[50:35] he already took the initiative
[50:37] hey
[50:38] he don't need us
[50:41] he could have stayed eternal and stayed
[50:44] by himself
[50:45] for an eternity and still existed he
[50:47] didn't want to
[50:49] right he didn't want to because inside
[50:51] of him he wanted fellowship right he
[50:54] wanted something that he could look at
[50:56] and talk to and commune with right right
[51:00] but he could have because he's
[51:01] self-existing so he didn't need a wife
[51:03] to exist he didn't need friends to exist
[51:06] right but he wanted that so he took the
[51:09] initiative
[51:11] to build a world
[51:13] for us to live on right
[51:16] then he took the initiative to make a
[51:18] man yeah and take a woman out of a man
[51:21] and say here fellowship now i can
[51:24] fellowship with myself right people are
[51:26] like mine
[51:27] but then we know what happened in the
[51:29] garden but you know what god didn't
[51:30] destroy the world
[51:32] he didn't take every human off the earth
[51:34] and start over again no his master plan
[51:36] was starting to roll right his master
[51:38] plan of having
[51:40] head ship
[51:41] he was the head
[51:43] adam and eve
[51:46] right right
[51:48] so
[51:48] brothers
[51:51] what must we do
[51:53] we must take the initiative
[51:56] glory i'm saying everything right but
[51:58] now your wife's gonna come up with some
[51:59] good ideas so don't just we're not
[52:01] saying it's a single thing i'm just
[52:02] saying what god said
[52:05] the head of the house is supposed to be
[52:07] if you're under subjection to your
[52:09] husband
[52:10] he takes the initiative right because
[52:12] listen folks if we make a mistake we got
[52:14] to answer for you and for and to god for
[52:16] me and her all right man if she makes a
[52:19] mistake she's just got to answer to me
[52:21] really
[52:22] i'm talking about a human mistake ain't
[52:24] talking about not being i'm talking
[52:25] about born again believers trying to get
[52:27] in their headship where they make a
[52:28] mistake
[52:30] because remember what the brother brown
[52:31] tell that woman
[52:33] she committed adultery on her husband
[52:34] right
[52:37] she said i've confessed that
[52:39] she said you didn't do it to god
[52:42] right
[52:43] he said you did it to your husband
[52:45] you've got to go tell him remember
[52:46] that's what she didn't want to do right
[52:48] oh it'll tear up my marriage but come to
[52:50] find out he did the same thing
[52:52] but you know what brother brown said
[52:53] they came together
[52:56] confessed their sins
[52:57] and left and
[52:59] brother brown said that they're
[53:00] christians now he was making a comment
[53:01] on how they become real good christian
[53:03] but see she had that so much in her
[53:06] though till she had covered it that's
[53:07] the one that he said that that a
[53:10] 55 gallon oil part owner wouldn't do any
[53:12] good because what she done she had done
[53:13] that and she had stacked it way back
[53:16] into the gable part of her soul she
[53:18] forgot about it in other words
[53:20] but god didn't forget about it right
[53:22] same thing with you and if you ever want
[53:23] to get anything from god you better do
[53:25] the same thing you better come down and
[53:27] confess to your wife
[53:32] have we really confessed
[53:34] to our wife
[53:36] because brother brown said you go
[53:37] confess to him say it then see god's
[53:39] already left you yeah
[53:41] so that didn't mean she was not savable
[53:43] it's just that god wasn't going to hear
[53:44] her until he went to her to the husband
[53:48] now what about a problem here with the
[53:49] village
[53:50] fixing to take this woman that he thinks
[53:52] is abraham's sister
[53:55] and then god says i know you're a
[53:57] righteous man
[54:00] or i wouldn't have told you this right
[54:02] tell us you've got to go get abraham
[54:04] right i bet a villain's head just
[54:06] started spinning around what
[54:08] i didn't do anything wrong
[54:10] no
[54:12] he went to abraham right and abraham
[54:14] restored
[54:16] that kingdom back
[54:17] because that man had to go through
[54:19] headship abraham was the head at the
[54:21] time
[54:22] abraham was the head he had to go back
[54:24] to abraham and apologize
[54:27] for abraham lying to him
[54:31] but that's the way god wanted it done
[54:33] same way with i'm talking about your
[54:34] sisters and men and brothers
[54:36] you got something you hadn't confessed
[54:38] you pray to god from now until the
[54:40] rapture takes place and you probably
[54:41] won't be in it
[54:44] you gotta confess to your wife
[54:46] confess to your spouse right
[54:49] then
[54:50] both of you go to god and say god don't
[54:52] ever let me do that again
[54:54] i'll stay right here under my headship
[54:56] my ruler
[54:58] but teach all right let's go to number
[55:00] two governor
[55:07] govern means to rule or be the lord
[55:10] govern and rule means to what control
[55:13] direct or strongly influence the actions
[55:16] because we can't make you sisters do
[55:19] things
[55:20] the more we try to make you do something
[55:22] it's the worst thing to do right
[55:25] you know i mean if your wife's cutting
[55:26] her hair or she's not coming to church
[55:28] starts throwing her makeup out the
[55:30] window and throwing her scissors out
[55:31] ain't gonna get it right that's right
[55:34] but you can strongly influence
[55:36] her action
[55:38] by the way you act right right
[55:41] you gotta see it in you first
[55:45] she's gotta see it in you first she
[55:48] can't see god no other way than through
[55:50] you
[55:51] to control direct or strongly influence
[55:54] the actions
[55:56] and conduct
[55:57] of others
[55:59] now not to control with an iron fist
[56:01] like brother brown said
[56:02] are to direct god doesn't god doesn't
[56:05] control us with a with an iron
[56:07] disposition or with he with what love
[56:10] grace
[56:11] and all these things he governs but
[56:13] we're supposed to govern
[56:15] right
[56:17] we're supposed to govern
[56:18] but man is not to rule with an iron fist
[56:20] but with love and correction right so we
[56:23] don't
[56:24] control as in dominate
[56:27] right
[56:28] but we control in the fact that hey
[56:30] you're doing this wrong
[56:32] let's listen to what brother brown said
[56:33] or watch what he said let's go to
[56:35] genesis 3 16 though first and read it
[56:37] again until the woman he said i will
[56:39] grate them all apart like sorrow not
[56:40] conception and sorrow thou shalt bring
[56:42] four children and thy desire
[56:45] shall be to thy husband
[56:48] and he shall rule over thee that's where
[56:50] you governor the rule part all right
[56:52] what's he going to do to control and he
[56:54] shall control or direct or strongly
[56:57] influence your action yeah that's what
[57:00] he's saying
[57:01] the male is going to from now on
[57:03] from now on he's going to to take and
[57:06] he's going to
[57:08] try to control and direct you in a
[57:11] loving sense of way not in a not in a
[57:13] demanding way
[57:16] let's go to first peter then three and
[57:18] read what we read this morning
[57:21] for after this matter in the old times
[57:22] the holy women also who trusted in god
[57:28] adorn themselves being in subjection
[57:30] unto their own husbands
[57:32] trusted god
[57:33] being in subjection
[57:35] even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him
[57:37] lord whose daughters ye are as long as
[57:40] you do well know as long as you do that
[57:43] and are not afraid
[57:44] with any amazement right
[57:47] now there's times in our marriage that
[57:50] that
[57:51] that honestly when june and i were were
[57:54] married
[57:55] there was always a fear of losing her
[58:00] because i wasn't born again there was no
[58:02] typos there was no
[58:04] there was no sure i wasn't a christian
[58:06] and she wasn't a christian
[58:08] but when we become christians that just
[58:10] took that thing just exploded that thing
[58:12] out of the way
[58:15] wouldn't matter if she left and went you
[58:16] know went on a vacation talk about going
[58:18] with her sister somewhere she said are
[58:20] you are you you know okay with that i
[58:22] said yeah i'm okay with that i don't
[58:24] have any problem at all because i trust
[58:26] her why do i trust her it's not maybe
[58:28] that i don't trust her i mean i trust
[58:30] her but i trust the goddess in her right
[58:33] man so i trust the goddess enter now
[58:35] she's not born again you better watch
[58:37] out right
[58:38] even being born again saying contempt
[58:40] you enough is like uh
[58:42] it's like we always told the uh kids at
[58:44] the youth banquet
[58:46] it's you we trust satan we don't right
[58:49] right
[58:50] so if you put the two together
[58:52] we don't trust you if you got the devil
[58:54] in you all right all right but we do we
[58:56] gain are not afraid with any amazement
[58:58] in other words right no surprises
[59:01] no surprises jen and i confessed
[59:04] ourselves to each other 12 years ago
[59:06] we're clean we're done that's finished
[59:08] no more to happen again
[59:10] not a problem with that you know what i
[59:11] can do i can put that over here on the
[59:13] shelf and forget about it because that
[59:15] thing's clean man
[59:16] done finished
[59:19] so i'm not afraid of that anymore when
[59:20] we start getting this fear factor out of
[59:22] the way because that's what god started
[59:25] abr adam was fear he had fear in him why
[59:30] you done something wrong right right he
[59:32] does something wrong
[59:34] he was in fear of what god would do to
[59:36] him well if you take a godly person a
[59:39] godly
[59:40] husband and a daughter and wife
[59:42] you gotta worry about that
[59:44] you don't have to worry about it
[59:46] that just takes all that out of the way
[59:50] i want those things taken out of the way
[59:52] glory
[59:54] because remember brother i'm talking
[59:55] about those filters or flues getting
[59:56] stopped up
[59:58] see that stops it up i got this fear i
[1:00:00] got this fear now brother brown will
[1:00:02] tell you and i didn't bring the quote
[1:00:04] but
[1:00:05] he said have a godly fear is different
[1:00:08] than being afraid
[1:00:10] having a godly fear because fear and
[1:00:11] reverence go together right
[1:00:13] he's afraid that he wouldn't serve god
[1:00:16] so there is before he had a fear right
[1:00:18] that he wouldn't be serving god but he
[1:00:20] wasn't afraid we're not going to be
[1:00:22] afraid of god right
[1:00:24] never are we to be afraid of our husband
[1:00:26] you're never supposed to be afraid of
[1:00:27] your husband right all right if you're
[1:00:29] afraid of your husband and your
[1:00:30] husband's not in his right role
[1:00:33] your husband's not in the right role if
[1:00:34] you're if you're afraid to go home
[1:00:39] somebody's saying man amen yeah quote
[1:00:41] number nine
[1:00:44] do you know ladies it's wrong to wear
[1:00:46] slacks
[1:00:48] do you know that do you know it's wrong
[1:00:49] to cut the locks of your hair off do you
[1:00:51] know what's wrong mister for you to
[1:00:52] continue to smoke and act the way you do
[1:00:54] do you know it's wrong for you not to be
[1:00:57] the husband of your house
[1:00:59] your wife get a little temper spell and
[1:01:00] kick you out the door and say yes bless
[1:01:03] your heart honey i'll come right back
[1:01:09] you have not been married for 32 years
[1:01:10] and i slept on the couch one time
[1:01:12] that's because the kids were sick
[1:01:14] and i just sleep on the couch
[1:01:17] i'm gonna sleep in my own bed
[1:01:20] she might go somewhere else but i'm
[1:01:21] gonna leave my bed
[1:01:31] i heard this one time and it's kind of
[1:01:32] funny but the guy a guy said he bought
[1:01:34] these real nice beautiful couches soft
[1:01:38] leather and all that stuff you know
[1:01:40] and somebody said well man what'd you
[1:01:42] spend so much in the couch he said cause
[1:01:43] i'm gonna be sleeping there most of the
[1:01:45] time
[1:01:51] just wake you up a little bit
[1:01:53] how can you listen to this
[1:01:55] did you know
[1:01:56] how can you be a tender at the house of
[1:01:59] god
[1:02:00] when you can't even control your own
[1:02:02] house
[1:02:03] that's exactly right
[1:02:05] do you know sister that your husband is
[1:02:07] not only your husband he is your ruler
[1:02:10] god said so because that the husband was
[1:02:13] not deceived the woman was deceived and
[1:02:16] you preachers will continue to make
[1:02:17] women pastors and preachers in church
[1:02:19] knowing that the word of god condenses
[1:02:21] it now we know who he's talking to he's
[1:02:22] not talking to us he's talking to the
[1:02:24] denominational world when he's talking
[1:02:25] about that but
[1:02:26] how can you be a tender because remember
[1:02:30] excuse me a um a
[1:02:32] bishop supposed to be the husband one
[1:02:35] wife
[1:02:37] but he doesn't exactly have to be
[1:02:38] married to preacher
[1:02:40] to preach
[1:02:41] right
[1:02:42] paul wasn't
[1:02:43] but if you're a deacon
[1:02:46] you need to be married who said be
[1:02:47] control of his family
[1:02:50] in other words how are you going to be a
[1:02:51] tender
[1:02:53] tender or are somebody that has some
[1:02:56] you know authority in the church how you
[1:02:57] going to be that if you can't even ruin
[1:02:59] your own home
[1:03:00] all right
[1:03:01] so
[1:03:03] if you can't control your own house
[1:03:05] how can you be attended at the house of
[1:03:06] god
[1:03:07] that's exactly right
[1:03:09] your husband's not only your husband
[1:03:11] but he is your ruler
[1:03:13] all right so let's go to
[1:03:18] what's the neck coming up
[1:03:21] okay
[1:03:23] while you're looking at that let me read
[1:03:24] this
[1:03:28] but being the head and being the one who
[1:03:30] is to initiate things
[1:03:32] also means the man is responsible
[1:03:35] you're responsible
[1:03:38] anyone in a leadership role is
[1:03:39] responsible for those who they are to
[1:03:42] lead
[1:03:44] and will answer to god
[1:03:46] for their role right
[1:03:48] that's why jacob said this is a fearful
[1:03:50] place the house of god right they're
[1:03:52] saying that this ain't something that
[1:03:54] this ain't a job that that
[1:03:57] i wish on anybody
[1:03:59] but if it's a job that god gave us to do
[1:04:01] we're going to do it right now okay but
[1:04:03] we got to make sure that we're right
[1:04:05] we're first protectors brother dale's
[1:04:07] first particularly of the fruit just
[1:04:09] like we read the husband
[1:04:13] so see we can spiritualize this a lot
[1:04:15] but let's just let's stay down here all
[1:04:17] right
[1:04:18] why didn't abraham why didn't god kill
[1:04:20] sarah sitting right there denying and
[1:04:22] lying
[1:04:24] right in the face of god
[1:04:27] sitting there as a mortal man eating
[1:04:28] flesh eating bread drinking milk
[1:04:31] said why
[1:04:33] i never said that she said i never said
[1:04:35] that
[1:04:37] uh oh my tell god that he's a liar to
[1:04:39] his face
[1:04:40] but he couldn't take her why she's a
[1:04:43] part of abraham amen he couldn't hurt
[1:04:46] her without hurting abraham now you
[1:04:48] women see where you belong
[1:04:51] and the bible said you women be like
[1:04:52] sarah was which adorned herself and
[1:04:54] modest apparel lived honest and true to
[1:04:56] their own husband loving him so much
[1:04:58] that
[1:04:59] i put he
[1:05:01] that he no he said he and he said she
[1:05:03] that's what brother brown made she
[1:05:04] called him her lord ruler
[1:05:07] ownership
[1:05:08] all right
[1:05:09] to initiate and govern
[1:05:12] brothers we got to remember
[1:05:13] we're the initiator but we're also the
[1:05:16] governor got it all right
[1:05:18] we're the governor of our home we're
[1:05:19] also the ruler of our home there's
[1:05:22] things that we must do
[1:05:24] to clean out our home
[1:05:26] answer to god you will
[1:05:28] for not doing it right all right
[1:05:31] but the best thing to do this is this is
[1:05:33] just to make it all come together and
[1:05:36] we'll stop in just a few minutes so i
[1:05:38] just got a few more quotes
[1:05:40] we'll stop for this afternoon
[1:05:44] we know what's right and wrong if we're
[1:05:46] a message believer or a born-again
[1:05:48] believer let's say that burning and
[1:05:49] blood we should know what between right
[1:05:50] and wrong you know even though if you've
[1:05:52] been in the message
[1:05:53] two weeks two months two years you do
[1:05:55] have a you do
[1:05:57] there's one thing you know

[1:06:43] you're supposed to live an example life
[1:06:47] it starts with us not the sisters
[1:06:49] exactly it starts with the men
[1:06:52] when we get to acting up
[1:06:53] it's just going to happen that the women
[1:06:56] are going to act up
[1:06:59] it's going to happen yeah
[1:07:01] sorry
[1:07:03] but if we get ourselves
[1:07:05] in line with god and what god wants us
[1:07:07] to do

[1:07:11] this plane and i'm going to make it
[1:07:12] clear
[1:07:13] and i may make it clear and plain again

[1:07:28] somebody say something one day like
[1:07:31] ain't nobody ever lived a life like that

[1:07:53] what if the neighbors see you walking
[1:07:54] around in shorts and smoking a cigarette
[1:07:58] well i thought he went to that church up
[1:07:59] there that they didn't believe in that
[1:08:01] stuff
[1:08:02] i'm not saying you did it i'm just
[1:08:03] telling you what what a role you and i
[1:08:05] should present i'm talking about males
[1:08:07] now females you can say amen all you
[1:08:09] want to because i'm on i'm on the mend
[1:08:11] now
[1:08:12] you're supposed to be the steward of
[1:08:13] your own home
[1:08:16] you're supposed to be the guy
[1:08:18] that makes the decisions
[1:08:20] the final decision now not just the but
[1:08:22] the final decision
[1:08:25] you're supposed to get the last word and
[1:08:26] it's not yet there
[1:08:31] now we're not supposed to be
[1:08:33] we're not supposed to be that's what i
[1:08:34] always say i'll get the last word in
[1:08:36] every argument
[1:08:38] but you're supposed to come together
[1:08:40] but
[1:08:41] sisters
[1:08:42] if you trust
[1:08:44] if you trust
[1:08:46] there's one thing i believe
[1:08:48] that sister peggy give you believe her
[1:08:50] husband
[1:08:51] and trust him
[1:08:52] so if he said honey we're gonna drive
[1:08:54] off that cliff
[1:08:57] keep shaking your head we're gonna die
[1:08:59] if we're gonna drive off that cliff
[1:09:01] god's got something in store now i'm not
[1:09:03] joking
[1:09:05] because she reverence her husband yes
[1:09:07] right
[1:09:09] and whether he'd be wrong i'm not saying
[1:09:10] you know i'm just for an example will
[1:09:12] they be wrong she trusts that man enough
[1:09:14] to know that if he's a godly man he got
[1:09:16] off somewhere but god's going to bring
[1:09:17] him in line but he's got to bring him in
[1:09:19] line first he's got to bring me in line
[1:09:21] first
[1:09:23] he's not trying to line up sister june
[1:09:25] he's trying to line up brother wayne
[1:09:26] then sister june sees by the way then
[1:09:28] there's the example
[1:09:31] is that too far off
[1:09:33] sisters you gotta look at your husband
[1:09:35] where's brother joe
[1:09:37] oh that's right y'all remember brother
[1:09:39] joe he's in california with us with his
[1:09:41] daughter and remember her for cancer
[1:09:44] i just missed him when i walked by there
[1:09:46] back there and didn't see him here but
[1:09:47] and that's another example too
[1:09:50] brother joe's one of the kindest men
[1:09:51] that i know
[1:09:53] very helpful
[1:09:55] but you know what
[1:09:58] he's that way at home away from us
[1:10:02] that's what makes a difference
[1:10:04] he's the same way right
[1:10:06] he's the same way
[1:10:08] we should all be the same way we
[1:10:09] shouldn't we shouldn't put on our robe
[1:10:12] and our and our priestly uh garments to
[1:10:15] come to church
[1:10:19] we're supposed to be that home amen
[1:10:22] and sisters you're supposed to look up
[1:10:23] to your husband right
[1:10:27] look at all your lives i want you to
[1:10:29] just not today but sometimes go home and
[1:10:32] just look at yourself
[1:10:34] and there's always people there's always
[1:10:35] regrets
[1:10:37] oh we're human
[1:10:39] i should have
[1:10:41] but like brother david marlo and i were
[1:10:43] talking about his wife uh becky
[1:10:46] today was 30 something years and she had
[1:10:48] passed away
[1:10:49] and i remember when i was younger
[1:10:52] but he went to the grave
[1:10:54] he come in today and he said man he said
[1:10:55] it's a bad day
[1:10:57] his wife and i thirty-something years
[1:10:59] ago
[1:11:00] and sister baker was a godly woman i
[1:11:02] remember
[1:11:04] and he said i'm ashamed of all the
[1:11:06] things that i did afterwards
[1:11:08] and he said the devil tells me that i'm
[1:11:10] lost but he's sitting here today
[1:11:13] i said brother david the reason
[1:11:15] the very reason you shouldn't believe
[1:11:16] that is number one that was a liar
[1:11:19] and the father of it number two is i
[1:11:22] said sit in sit and sit in here and just
[1:11:25] get wet
[1:11:26] get under the fountain you're going to
[1:11:27] get wet
[1:11:29] just keep coming to the fountain
[1:11:31] and i told him i said if it took god to
[1:11:33] reveal to me today
[1:11:35] that god take my
[1:11:37] human life today to save my children
[1:11:40] let me drop dead
[1:11:43] but see that's not gonna that's that's
[1:11:44] making a deal with god you don't do that
[1:11:46] but you can also say that as a human
[1:11:48] though and that's what i said brother
[1:11:49] dave when i said brother david her
[1:11:51] passing away
[1:11:54] he said well it might have been
[1:11:55] different no it's not because that's not
[1:11:57] what happened
[1:12:00] but that
[1:12:01] woman went down with the testimony
[1:12:04] she was a godly girl
[1:12:06] pretty girl never know her to even you
[1:12:09] know say anything wrong i remember when
[1:12:11] i was little
[1:12:15] there's the testimony
[1:12:17] there's the 30-year testimony that goes
[1:12:20] for
[1:12:20] eternity that testimony will last
[1:12:23] right up into glory
[1:12:25] you know what he said he said he went
[1:12:26] through the grave yesterday
[1:12:29] and he told me he said i want to see her
[1:12:30] again
[1:12:32] i said you get bored again you'll see
[1:12:34] her again
[1:12:36] stay here
[1:12:37] stay under the fountain
[1:12:39] stay where you need to be
[1:12:44] because
[1:12:46] a life live
[1:12:47] is better than any sermon
[1:12:50] and we fail and we make mistakes
[1:12:53] but men
[1:12:54] you need to stay men
[1:12:57] so that your wife reverence you so much
[1:13:00] that whatever decision if y'all come
[1:13:02] together and sure it is you need to come
[1:13:03] together to make family decisions and
[1:13:05] financial decisions but ultimately
[1:13:09] sisters
[1:13:10] the male
[1:13:12] has the last word
[1:13:14] in any decision
[1:13:17] if you decide to do something together
[1:13:21] that's okay
[1:13:23] but remember
[1:13:24] if he's a godly man not just what
[1:13:26] brother said brother i said if that big
[1:13:27] word if he's a godly man
[1:13:30] you got to trust that god's dealing with
[1:13:32] him in some way
[1:13:35] to just back off
[1:13:37] say okay lord
[1:13:40] whatever my husband decides that's what
[1:13:41] we're going to do amen but now remember
[1:13:43] we're going to talk about this afternoon
[1:13:45] if he does something out from under that
[1:13:48] if he comes out and says no we're we're
[1:13:51] no we're we're going to go to the
[1:13:52] baptist church tomorrow you can go ahead
[1:13:54] and start cutting your hair wearing
[1:13:57] come on people right you'll know one
[1:13:59] thing's for sure
[1:14:01] he's not under the headship of the holy
[1:14:03] spirit right right right so you don't
[1:14:05] have to do that
[1:14:07] all right
[1:14:08] there was a situation happening a few
[1:14:10] days ago or about a week or so ago
[1:14:13] there was a a person leaving a church
[1:14:16] him and his wife
[1:14:18] and they left the church but then they
[1:14:21] told the pastor they were going to this
[1:14:23] is a message church they told the pastor
[1:14:25] they were going to
[1:14:26] i think claude told you about it when
[1:14:27] does he not go to his church but they
[1:14:29] left and then the the man that left told
[1:14:32] the pastor said well well my wife wants
[1:14:34] to go here but i want to go to brother
[1:14:36] clark's church but we're going to start
[1:14:38] coming here
[1:14:39] and where's the headship in that right
[1:14:42] you know what i tell my wife
[1:14:44] i tell you she wants to get in the car
[1:14:46] and go to another church
[1:14:48] go to it right but i'm coming here
[1:14:50] right because i believe that's what this
[1:14:52] for the words at right okay but for me
[1:14:54] to tell the pastor of the church i'm
[1:14:56] going to
[1:14:57] that i don't want to come to your church
[1:14:59] but my wife does so we're going to do
[1:15:00] what she says in other words
[1:15:02] that's not right
[1:15:04] that's not right right and your sisters
[1:15:06] we'll talk about it this afternoon if
[1:15:07] anything your husband tells you to do
[1:15:09] this outside of the word of god
[1:15:11] then he has taken his self you haven't
[1:15:13] removed him
[1:15:14] god has removed him from your headshot
[1:15:16] right now because he's not coming down
[1:15:18] under the word of god you're here he's
[1:15:20] now moved over to here now you're not
[1:15:22] going to move up here you're still here
[1:15:25] because you're still supposed to respect
[1:15:26] that man
[1:15:28] anyway right i'll read it but brother
[1:15:30] brown said you respect him but you don't
[1:15:31] have to go to church with him
[1:15:33] or don't have to cut your hair do what
[1:15:34] he says what god's directly speaking to
[1:15:36] you he's your head right when it comes
[1:15:39] to matters of the word but when it comes
[1:15:40] to the matters of us living together and
[1:15:42] us being husband and wife
[1:15:46] tell me one thing
[1:15:49] answer me a
[1:15:50] question what would happen
[1:15:55] if
[1:15:57] one day that did happen one day your
[1:15:59] husband wants to come up and say
[1:16:02] we're not gonna go to church there
[1:16:03] anymore we're gonna go
[1:16:05] to the baptist church i'm gonna talk
[1:16:07] about another message church baptist
[1:16:08] church
[1:16:10] what would you do sister
[1:16:12] when you love that husband
[1:16:14] you love him so much
[1:16:16] but now let me tell you something
[1:16:18] this is what the prophet said i didn't i
[1:16:20] didn't bring the quote but i'm gonna go
[1:16:21] this way just for a few minutes
[1:16:24] but you do one thing
[1:16:25] you still reverence that husband
[1:16:28] you don't separate yourself from that
[1:16:30] man
[1:16:32] please don't because you'll you'll
[1:16:35] you'll do something that'll cause him to
[1:16:36] do something wrong maybe
[1:16:38] same way with you men
[1:16:40] you know the bible says that if you
[1:16:41] cause your wife to commit adultery that
[1:16:45] you're guilty
[1:16:47] right you cause your wife to commit
[1:16:49] adultery you're guilty of it not your
[1:16:50] wife i mean she's guilty of it but
[1:16:52] you're guilty first but you're the what
[1:16:54] you're the head you're the one on top
[1:16:56] you're the beginner on the top you're
[1:16:58] the one that's supposed to initiate
[1:16:59] you're the one that's supposed to govern
[1:17:02] but you'll answer
[1:17:04] for your role
[1:17:07] but she won't have to answer
[1:17:09] for europe
[1:17:11] but you gotta answer for your role and
[1:17:13] her role
[1:17:14] all right let's go to the last quote
[1:17:16] number 11.
[1:17:22] but you men are responsible
[1:17:26] listen
[1:17:27] now i think that we get that man and
[1:17:29] woman now a woman is let me get this
[1:17:30] right good now so that you can see it
[1:17:33] woman is subject to her husband and the
[1:17:35] bible said that a man should rule over
[1:17:37] his wife but how they've changed that
[1:17:39] the woman rules over the land now you
[1:17:42] stay home john we're not going and that
[1:17:44] settled it yes my dear
[1:17:46] see but let me tell you something mister
[1:17:49] you're going to have to answer for your
[1:17:50] wife but your wife is never going to
[1:17:53] have to answer for you
[1:17:54] you are the head of the woman and god is
[1:17:56] the head of the man now listen that's in
[1:17:58] everything right when that double
[1:18:00] covenant come it wasn't just a double
[1:18:02] covenant for just adam and eve
[1:18:05] it stays forever i said forever down
[1:18:08] here
[1:18:09] goes back up when we go back to glory
[1:18:10] right sure you are the head of the woman
[1:18:12] and god is the head of man therefore he
[1:18:14] said let the man cut his hair because of
[1:18:15] christ and let the woman have her hair
[1:18:17] for his
[1:18:18] for if she cuts her hair she dishonors
[1:18:21] her husband
[1:18:23] see what i mean or what the scripture
[1:18:24] says all right let's go to 12.
[1:18:29] questions answers too if i seen a man
[1:18:30] come in here with long hair hanging down
[1:18:32] his back like a woman i'd say mister why
[1:18:34] don't you go to the barber shop you look
[1:18:36] like a woman see
[1:18:37] but men usually don't do that in other
[1:18:39] words men don't even come in with long
[1:18:40] hair see not as man now not as the
[1:18:43] infallibility of man
[1:18:45] they're just as guilty as the woman
[1:18:47] and by the way a man that'll let his
[1:18:50] wife do that
[1:18:52] he's guilty double of it yeah because
[1:18:55] when you
[1:18:56] urge her for authority
[1:18:58] and she's doing it and you're saying
[1:19:00] it's okay
[1:19:01] that's where the double part comes in
[1:19:02] you're guilty for saying it's okay she's
[1:19:04] guilty for doing it and you're guilty
[1:19:06] for letting her do it
[1:19:07] all right i'm sorry this is the prophet
[1:19:09] not me and by the way a man that'll let
[1:19:11] his wife do that he's guilty double of
[1:19:13] it because he's supposed to be the one
[1:19:15] that has to say so in the house
[1:19:18] and that man can't even rule his own
[1:19:20] house how could he do it
[1:19:22] in the house of god
[1:19:24] all right
[1:19:26] i'm not scolding you to be mean
[1:19:28] i'm only so happy for you i just don't
[1:19:30] want satan to get foot in any way
[1:19:32] anywhere see i want you to move upward
[1:19:35] not backward yeah don't never let no man
[1:19:38] deceive you by some enchantments or
[1:19:39] something another looked like or
[1:19:41] something saying oh well it don't see
[1:19:43] that's the way satan interprets the word
[1:19:44] to eve see
[1:19:46] you believe just what the word says all
[1:19:47] right
[1:19:48] all right last one
[1:19:50] you know i'll make a few comments
[1:19:52] we'll stop right there and we'll start
[1:19:54] on uh
[1:19:56] that god is still the ruler
[1:19:57] over the woman
[1:19:59] if her husband is not born again or not
[1:20:01] a christian questions and answers on
[1:20:03] hebrews listen here the man is a ruler
[1:20:06] don't you think don't you think you can
[1:20:08] rule the house holding the system you're
[1:20:09] not the ruler of the house you're
[1:20:11] absolutely you're not a slave now but
[1:20:13] your help mate and adam the man has the
[1:20:15] rule over his wife and he's responsible
[1:20:18] solely for his wife
[1:20:20] god makes the man answer for his wife
[1:20:22] now read and see if god says
[1:20:24] that now and then he read the scripture
[1:20:26] somebody asked a question about that
[1:20:29] but we've got to be good stewards amen
[1:20:36] we got to be good stewards of our home
[1:20:39] that's why a lot of you are taking those
[1:20:40] classes with the uh financial peace
[1:20:43] university which is it is faith-based
[1:20:45] the bible tells us to be good stewards
[1:20:47] of our money
[1:20:48] remember remember the guy that went out
[1:20:50] and buried his money
[1:20:52] actually god took that money away from
[1:20:54] you because you didn't do something with
[1:20:55] it
[1:20:57] you got money buried in your house
[1:21:02] i'm telling you what the bible says
[1:21:05] fixing the spending he said
[1:21:08] makes his bill fall down it goes
[1:21:14] the dollars are so folded like this
[1:21:16] until they won't come out you know they
[1:21:18] say
[1:21:20] i'm just telling you what the bible says
[1:21:22] remember he gave so much to one guy he
[1:21:24] gave so much to another and so much to
[1:21:26] another and this guy just hit his money
[1:21:28] and didn't do nothing with it and the
[1:21:29] other ones went out and did something
[1:21:30] with the money what'd he do it was an
[1:21:32] increase
[1:21:33] these other ones came out he used their
[1:21:34] money right they did right things
[1:21:37] we're supposed to be that right and i'm
[1:21:40] telling you people
[1:21:41] exemplary we're supposed to be where
[1:21:43] they everything we do
[1:21:46] in word indeed
[1:21:48] put it in scripture do all in the name
[1:21:50] of the lord jesus
[1:21:52] i'm gonna tell you something
[1:21:55] i heard dave ramsey the other night we
[1:21:57] we were there and and kind of shocked
[1:21:59] some of the people but i'm gonna tell
[1:22:01] you something
[1:22:02] you us in our finances
[1:22:06] his daughter bounced the check
[1:22:09] i told you before june june bounce one
[1:22:11] check 1981 we'd never bounce another one
[1:22:15] he made his daughter
[1:22:18] go to the bank
[1:22:20] and apologize to the bank president for
[1:22:22] bouncing the check amen
[1:22:24] you know why
[1:22:25] he said because you lied to that banker
[1:22:28] when you write a check knowing there's
[1:22:30] no money in your funds you're lying to
[1:22:32] the bank and saying that it's there and
[1:22:34] folks
[1:22:36] that's not godly
[1:22:37] ain't nothing godly about that it never
[1:22:40] will be godly and it's never going to be
[1:22:41] god
[1:22:43] you'd be a good steward because you know
[1:22:44] what people are looking at you
[1:22:47] people are watching you
[1:22:50] you got it don't spend it right
[1:22:53] right
[1:22:54] that's right ain't got it don't spend it
[1:22:55] right
[1:22:57] sorry
[1:22:59] it's like the banker told daddy you know
[1:23:01] about
[1:23:01] man's parents
[1:23:03] you know he didn't he didn't say that
[1:23:05] because we bounced checked
[1:23:08] he didn't say that because we foreclosed
[1:23:09] on loans
[1:23:11] did he
[1:23:12] because every time we went to that bank
[1:23:14] and we needed some money he loaned us
[1:23:15] money guess what we did we did something
[1:23:17] very strange we paid it all back yeah
[1:23:21] on time
[1:23:22] and ahead of time
[1:23:24] but you know what
[1:23:26] you say well that's just that's just man
[1:23:28] no
[1:23:30] i'm telling you
[1:23:31] i'm going to read it this afternoon
[1:23:33] in a leadership role
[1:23:35] everybody's looking up to you right
[1:23:38] so men if we're in a leadership role
[1:23:41] that's why when jim bounced that check
[1:23:43] in 1981 i took over the checkbook
[1:23:47] now honestly i gave it back to her about
[1:23:49] 10 years ago just in case someone what
[1:23:51] happened you sisters i know a lot of you
[1:23:53] control the checkbook and that's fine i
[1:23:54] don't mind that
[1:23:56] but you your husbands need to know also
[1:23:58] so i gave it over to her so if i were to
[1:24:00] drop dead she wouldn't be lost and not
[1:24:03] know where to find stuff what bill to
[1:24:06] pay and how to pay it and all these
[1:24:07] things uh you know i'm sorry
[1:24:11] but you're going to give an account for
[1:24:13] every idle
[1:24:15] word right
[1:24:16] right
[1:24:18] that you do
[1:24:19] in life
[1:24:22] but don't say forgive me lord and then
[1:24:23] do it tomorrow
[1:24:24] yeah
[1:24:25] that don't work either right
[1:24:34] you've been drinking all your life stop
[1:24:36] drinking right
[1:24:38] simple
[1:24:39] it don't drink no more
[1:24:41] man
[1:24:42] don't say god forgive me god forgive me
[1:24:44] god forgive me that's one thing god
[1:24:45] won't do
[1:24:48] he won't remember what you've done
[1:24:50] but he knows your heart right and if
[1:24:53] your heart's not right
[1:24:55] see god god is god is willing and saying
[1:24:58] in the scripture to forgive you why
[1:24:59] because you got to forget you got a
[1:25:00] heart that wants to be forgotten
[1:25:02] that's a problem with a lot of you
[1:25:05] you don't like change
[1:25:06] and you ain't going to change because
[1:25:07] you think you're the big guy standing up
[1:25:09] here
[1:25:10] you won't change
[1:25:11] even in that even in a leadership role
[1:25:14] we've got to still be soft and pliable
[1:25:17] we still we never never be hard right
[1:25:19] never be never be where well bless not
[1:25:22] if you either got to do it
[1:25:24] no but if god tells you to tell somebody
[1:25:26] that yeah you better listen to what god
[1:25:28] said through that person
[1:25:31] stop the nonsense
[1:25:33] all of us
[1:25:34] males take our role
[1:25:37] as the head of the house
[1:25:40] keep your wife under control
[1:25:42] in godly fear
[1:25:44] and ungodly love
[1:25:46] because there's one thing's going to
[1:25:48] happen if she's not a christian she's
[1:25:50] going to rebel yeah so you've got to
[1:25:52] know how to handle that you got to say
[1:25:54] listen honey we'll read it tonight says
[1:25:55] listen honey
[1:25:57] let's just sit down and talk about this
[1:26:00] don't start going in this blessed
[1:26:01] goddess bless screaming no say look
[1:26:03] let's discuss this we i've come to a
[1:26:05] junction in my life
[1:26:07] where i'm not satisfied with me god's
[1:26:09] not satisfied with me
[1:26:11] and we need to get this thing all back
[1:26:13] together again because like brother
[1:26:14] brown said without the home in harmony
[1:26:18] there's always going to be friction
[1:26:20] there's always going to be those human
[1:26:22] emotions
[1:26:23] and sisters you all have the human
[1:26:24] emotion side
[1:26:26] more than the man does
[1:26:28] but i just want to make sure that you
[1:26:29] understand that because remember when we
[1:26:31] start talking about
[1:26:33] the man is a leader we'll go back to
[1:26:36] ephesians 5 this afternoon as man is the
[1:26:38] leader
[1:26:39] he's under the leadership of christ
[1:26:42] right
[1:26:44] we lead christ leads us we leave
[1:26:47] the body or
[1:26:48] the woman we'll read that this afternoon
[1:26:50] so let's stand
[1:26:54] let me read this one thing i'll read it
[1:26:55] back tonight be careful how you use a
[1:26:57] role
[1:26:58] of a leader yeah
[1:27:02] be careful there's one you need we'll
[1:27:04] talk about this afternoon be careful
[1:27:06] being the role of a leader right all
[1:27:08] right or a ruler
[1:27:11] because you can be a ruler and become a
[1:27:13] dictator right or you can become a ruler
[1:27:16] what brother brown say power without
[1:27:17] character is satanic or dictatorship
[1:27:20] but power with character
[1:27:22] respect to what
[1:27:24] rule amen what not just this man
[1:27:27] but your whole family right
[1:27:30] man we get us in line you know i i don't
[1:27:32] i don't agree with the if we get our
[1:27:34] wife lined up we're going to no i
[1:27:35] believe if we get lined up our wives
[1:27:37] will get lined up right
[1:27:38] hey man
[1:27:40] is that the way it's supposed to be
[1:27:41] right
[1:27:42] i didn't make it i didn't make the rule
[1:27:45] but god told us that our headship was
[1:27:48] christ and that the woman's head right
[1:27:50] was the man
[1:27:52] we can't change that you know what he
[1:27:54] made provisions for us to live under
[1:27:56] that and be happy right you hear me one
[1:27:58] more time he made provisions for us to
[1:28:00] live under that kind of headship and be
[1:28:03] happy with it
[1:28:07] man is happy with a good wife wife is
[1:28:10] happy with a good husband
[1:28:12] in this role of leadership let's know
[1:28:16] 37 inspiring 37 inspire book let's sing
[1:28:19] praise lord
[1:28:40] he can't mold you if you're already hard
[1:28:43] but when your clay and water is there
[1:28:46] you're pliable he can move
[1:29:01] am
[1:29:15] things of the world you know not the
[1:29:16] world but the things the day-to-day
[1:29:18] action that we have today
[1:29:36] let's
[1:29:50] support
[1:30:18] glory
[1:30:25] where they come from
[1:30:42] oh
[1:31:01] absolutely
[1:31:16] oh
[1:31:33] is
[1:31:55] we all shall see
[1:31:59] amen
[1:32:16] he doesn't leave with iron fist so we
[1:32:18] should
[1:32:19] he doesn't leave he leads with nail
[1:32:21] scarred hands
[1:32:23] just take this and
[1:32:25] man it's
[1:32:26] wonderful when you put it in your mouth
[1:32:28] but paul said it was real bitter when it
[1:32:30] got in your belly why but it was
[1:32:32] starting to become a part of you and you
[1:32:34] were going to have to live
[1:32:36] we got to live this thing people we
[1:32:38] cannot
[1:32:48] there's not going to be
[1:32:50] 1160 sermons in glory
[1:32:53] laid on the shelf somewhere
[1:32:55] no we're going to be that 1160 sermons
[1:32:58] we're going to be those 66 books of the
[1:33:00] bible
[1:33:01] we're not going to have to go
[1:33:04] adam said or
[1:33:06] over here and jeremiah no jeremiah's
[1:33:08] going to be there i mean it was a part
[1:33:09] of what he wrote right right he's going
[1:33:11] to be there glory all of them's going to
[1:33:13] be there but you know what
[1:33:16] you know what so what a blessed feeling
[1:33:18] is
[1:33:19] you're going to be able to tell jeremiah
[1:33:22] the revelation glory
[1:33:24] of what he was talking about exactly
[1:33:26] you're gonna be able to say jeremiah you
[1:33:28] remember all those symbols you saw
[1:33:30] ezekiel you saw that wheel in the middle
[1:33:32] of the wheel you saw them four beasts
[1:33:35] ezekiel never witnessed those four
[1:33:37] beasts in his own personal life right
[1:33:39] the line of men and eagle did it
[1:33:41] but we do
[1:33:43] but that was what we pull out of the
[1:33:44] word put in us in our heart and we don't
[1:33:47] have to read ezekiel i mean we do you
[1:33:48] understand what i'm saying but we don't
[1:33:50] have to go to ezekiel to get it that's
