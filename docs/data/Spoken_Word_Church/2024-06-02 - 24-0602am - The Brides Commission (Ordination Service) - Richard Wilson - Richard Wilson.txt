agree with just throw it out and brother wait till he'll clean it up and I'll leave so that's let Miss sure glad to be here amen it's been a long time but let me let me uh read a scripture then I'll let you sit down let's turn to Matthew 16 I have to get me some reading glasses I passed 25 a few times ago few two or three times four times maybe close to it Ma Matthew 16 verse 13 just just have a bow our heads from word of prayer just a moment Heavenly Father we're thankful this morning we've come together to worship you the true and living God and the word goes by and there there happenings and things and taking place and no one knows what's really taking place with your bride yes Lord Jesus I'm so glad of that that we know you and you know us and we're in you and you're in us and it's just a great family thing Lord that's between the family of God's family help us this morning we come together and to speak on Thy Word how sacred it is yes how true it is Lord and how true this word is you've given us help us to realize and how rever and respectful and honor we are to be in our lives our walk with you each day let's bless each one now thank for the word we've already heard it's wonderful lesson Lord the singings and special singing as we read the word Lord you come and bless it in our heart speak to us in our word this morning we pray and ask these things in Jesus Jesus Christ's name amen Matthew 1 16:13 and when Jesus came into the coast and say to Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say I the son of manam they said some said thou John the Baptist Elias or other Jeremiah or one of the prophets he sath unto them but whom say ye that I am Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven I say also unto thee that thou art Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou sh loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven may the Lord bless his word you be seated amen yeah I wanted to read another another scripture I read it while I'm thinking of it and talk by the way speak maybe a little bit that the bride the the commission of the Bride it's what she's brother said that how we he mentioned these Pentecostal people and not no disregard to anyone but how can they fulfill the the commission this end time when they don't even believe it right they don't even believe in Malachi 4 that's really our commission the whole whole the whole thing revealed in Malachi 4 we know that see because Maliki 4 ends the Old Testament I don't mean it because it's the last chapter last book in the new Old Testament what's revealed in the Malachi 4 but Malachi 4 reveals it it ends also the New Testament amen because what reveal because what what closed out the Old Testament closes out the new right so he didn't ask them he didn't ask him who who the man say I the Son of God am right right he didn't ask him that no he didn't right who I the son of man am amen right he said you're the Christ the son of the Living God he got an answer but he didn't get the answer he asked that's right so then anyway let's read uh m I said Upon This Rock I'll be a church the only way you know God is by Revelation only way you see God the only way God God is getting to you is by Revelation that's the only way that's what brother BR said the world's long for God is revelation amen that's right exactly so uh let's turn to Deuteronomy 2929 one verse I'll read there and I got I got a stack of books here and I told Brother wait I I'm not going to read all of them we get out next week sometime all right slow as I am I'm slowed down a little bit yeah anyway Deuteronomy 29:29 the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and our children amen that ye may do all the words of this law amen so let's now let secret things you know Amos 3:7 said the children of the Lord God do nothing but first he what he Reveals His secret to his Prophet right amen so they there was there was something to take place on this Earth in the end time time of the end yes sir see and a preacher like me or you you pre Brothers couldn't fulfill it it wouldn't come to you right so God at the time when it's to be fulfilled had a prophetic gift on the earth a word prophet and the word that mster that secret would come to him and he would according to God and come back down and bring it to you and me now it's ours it's revealed if it's revealed there there's a statement says that that we got an open book that's true amen if it's open see but but if it's not open it's not open right amen that's right but actually when that word is revealed to you it's sealed in you amen it's the book he only got one book that's the Bible now Adam Adam didn't carry that around he but the Christ we Adam knew that we know he he's in print right here that's the Christ in print amen so so his Christ's life will match that book because it's the only book so that that's the book you're sealed with if you're not sealed with that book you're not sealed cu the Seal of God it seals you wrote that book am amen they're the same person God ain't one like that he's one in person amen many forms but one person right that's exactly right so now what we're facing today is something different yes this message is totally different from anything else amen yes sir amen now when I say different I don't mean contrary I'm saying it's different it took a prophetic gift a prophet of God he's next thing to God Amen he's not God but he's the next thing to God see so he he gave us the the the the message brought the word to us as Elijah would do right so now so me let me take a word say a word just a moment I'm 85 years old when man I heard a lot I've heard a lot of preaching over the 50 some years close to 60 years you know and the reason I stand here today is called brother Dale brother Woodby brother Mo brother Jimmy back there Brother Dean she's not here sister P the foundation they got me started right on the right foundation amen and that's that's why I stand and see he's always Back The Years back brother he always referred when there's a question come up they always ask brother Dale but he God really used the brother but brother Harris he knows he back there those days brother brother Harris still with us brother Dale you know he's here but he's sick and he couldn't be here but see they said word there's a word here now we can't look back there's no looking back everything has happened I ain't been here in 11 12 years it happened for a reason it wasn't bad it was good everything works for the good those that's called so it's not bad and I no hard feelings nowhere I hope it's not on you my I know they not on my part see but I I can stand here with a brother Bob was talking about a pure conscience and say I know I know where I've been the last few years okay so that that's just the grace of God Amen so now I want to I want to get a thought now what's this what what is what is our commission we we we've had seen we've seen Brothers come and go y now if we don't do it who's going to do it they've been they've been almost 59 years this December since brother Brandon left we're still here and people still dying physically right so my understanding the when when when Brothers come and they bring the message and I know I've met a lot of preachers over the 59 years been trying to follow this message right something like that close to it and they've come and gone but I believe as brother way was talking about the oration service that we're going to do there a new day da there's a level in God's word is rising if we don't take this message to that next level we're not the bride right that's right and we don't do it as Son of God Son of God won't do it brother said direct statement to say it's not Son of God anymore I mean it is if you coming into the body and you have been you know a Salvation I I don't I Ain saying the door is closed but it's it's getting pretty closed they salvation see but you bring a person into the body but I can pick up a book right here say his future home that's to a redeemed man and woman yeah you can't talk to a sinner on that that's somebody's already been redeemed you see what I'm saying that's right so then we have to we have to take this word brother R said you got to go all the way to the talk right and that's why that's where this message takes you it takes you to top now I hope and pray we we we understand and see that amen yeah let me get started on my notes and I got a lot of things wrote down I'm going to try to go as fast brother brother Wade said just take my time and take Liberty and and I appreciate that and stifling through a few things here but anyway you know just just remember to pray for me that I I'll go through these notes of I and if if you can believe it believe it if you can't all right all right I won't get mad at you but I I believe it what I'm going to say I absolutely believe and no question why I believe it or not I believe it I believe it's the truth because I've heard brother Dale many many time May cour him a few times today many times he say the Revelation the truth is the Revelation that's right absolutely that's what the truth is you'll know the truth you'll know the Revelation makes you free that's right now so now if you I want I going to read in in the in Genesis we'll Hur here used to have a clock hanging up there don't so I guess it's all right go a little long maybe yeah let's turn to Genesis 1 uh verse 26 God said let us make man and image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over foul they are over the cattle over all the Earth over every creeping thing that created upon the Earth so God created a man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now this is when he Elohim when he's self existence he's not Lord God he's God right he's not put anything in in into to form like you know know the Flesh and so on right so when you when we get thinking about the the being back with the mind of God and back in God's mind and what we was before the foundation of the world then when you when you go back before the foundation of the world don't get outside God's mind because you'll get in trouble if you do you can't do that you all you was back there he said Spirit you w even Spirits either a thought or had to be in God's mind so I'll get I'm get a little ahead of myself I'm I'm going to go through as notes in a minute but see Christ The Mystery of God reveal now if I'm an attribute of God see he God existed by himself with his attributes now his attributes are Eternal his thoughts are Eternal if I if I'm a attribute or thought of God and he predestinated for me and place me here in this day only in Christ am by that attribute only way that only way attribute can be expressed is in Christ no other way right so that shows you you bypass the word because Christ is the word right all right go ahead then so God created man he said and he said he blessed them and God said unto them now he said before he separated the masculine from the fish and so on he said multiply replenish the Earth amen now that's the commission amen yeah that's the thought I want you to see in your mind multiply replenish the Earth amen and some do it have dominion over the F fish of SE and the found they are ever living creep thing that creep on the earth so so God did that he had and he goes on you know takes takes the woman the r from the woman man and makes the woman now so this this is when God with Elohim he wasn't God he was God's OB of worship see see so now now he said he created man not a man he created man all right that he made him a a spirit being or theophany man amen that right now showing that he would multiply and replenish the Earth through spiritual multiplication now that's the way we're supposed to come so now if we if we're the very people of God that's exactly how you're coming right now through a spiritual multiplication not through sex desire I brought four children my wife brought them in the world y I had four every one of them was born dead right there was spiritually speaking there's born dead there was concealed in was conceived in iniquity in sin that's what David said because actually now people don't like to hear this but you when you come into the world you come wrong I'm gonna prove it to you in a few minutes I can but God's help amen you come Ser seed in the flesh he said what if it wasn't sex why do you die so sex brought you here God never brought you that way no he gave you a soul he gave you a yes sir say he can't give you a soul he's not a Creator but your flesh is Ser seed it dies it born dead right so it has to be changed right and here we are still 6,000 years it ain't happened yet come on come on Brother come on it ain't happened yet 6,000 years but it's going to the people the people the people's here to make it happen exactly what I believe yes sir he'll do we'll do it as sure as our stand here somebody will somebody's going to do it it's going to be revealed to somebody why can't I say it's going to be revealed to me you the same way now let me stay my notes here and just take my time here he God see God man forming from the dust of the earth he took a rib for the the man made the woman I've heard the word woman means a man with a womb see he had a womb now he he don't don't he said don't don't eat from that tree no right don't do that stay away from that don't stay away from that you can eat from a tree of life y right you can eat from a tree of life any tree you want to eat from but don't eat from that tree of knowledge if you eat you'll surely die amen amen all right okay now why why you going to die you going to be brought here wrong right amen you brought here death Doom right right now I'm going to read you something here in a minute Lord God said it was very good he looked at him very good had a masterpiece yeah amen now look see that Adam was the god of the Earth right he told him multiply replenish the earth now he had a title deed the abstract title deed had absolutely he had the book according to brother Bram future home what he is that he said it was given to bring forth Sons and Daughters of God because God predestinated a world of sons and daughters so that book was given to them to to bring forth to Children through spiritual multiplication other words through the spoken word that's how we supposed to come because to prove that that's the way we're coming now we're coming by the spoken creative word you come wrong now that's what brother R said he said we have to have a per virgin first amen remember that we have to have a cleaning out first he said before God can do something like Daniel 12 said men to be purified and made white and tried but the wicked won't be they'll let be purified the wicked won't they rejected amen but see now look see he had the title de the book to all creation right I mean over the whole earth not just eternal life to the Earth he had it Adam had that stay with the word and you'll be okay now look and from the from this book he his help me the woman they were to multiply and replenish the Earth with sons and daughters of God that God had predestinated amen now to bring now here's the thought to bring forth that children through the book see that child will have never died righten right amen bring it bring it by the word he'll never die amen cu the word's Eternal right now I want I want to read a statement out here the future home just a second real quickly hold on now think of this see this this the Tree of Life there in the garden there was a tree of life in the Garden of Eden this is page 53 the future home that he might have eaten from if he had if he hadn't to fail yeah that tree of life reminded him all the time that he was staying young his youth was continue on right right now what was that brother BR said Adam was the word what he that how you have word children if he wasen the word right same way spoken words reg your seed brother said a seed of God comes to a born again right you got to have a born again man to bring the true word of God to get the new birth of them that's spiritual multiplication see so bring forth that child he would have never died amen right right right you see what I'm saying am so that tree of life which the word of God was keeping Adam Young cuz he's oncoming something same way with is you and me it's an oncoming something we're coming to it as sure as I stand here some someone's going to come to it exactly right because now look now let's go on a minute so Paul said in Galatians 3 I believe it is he said I'm afraid because he said Satan has Bewitched you you know what that word bewitch means anybody ever up and think of it it means your your your resistance has been broke down something was brought to you that you just could not resist that's what happened to Eve it broke her resistance down so anointed on anointed ones in the end time exactly right there you go they're so anointed the people can't resist it because why they're not in the word right brother say you be constantly in the word or you'll take a spirit fing is the holy spirit that's what he said amen praise God forever now let me hurry here see you see the woman hbed with a serpent see he Beed her right you will not surely die one word took us out brother said one word will keep you out that's how straight how close it's got to be amen she took the service interpretation of the word the devil y that's what he said all right then the book the book went back to God that right what actually went back to God you did you couldn't come that way you were going you come God permit God will permit you to come through sex desire am cuz you're the book right the only one book right right exactly right amen now I got to think about that I just burn I just set my soul to fire I may get to shout a little bit can tell see so back to original owner see she eat from the wrong tree the serpent be I eat she gave it to Adam and he eat now she didn't hand him an [Music] apple amen she eat from the wrong tree yeah right that what she brought you here through sex desire amen right right through the serpent Satan use the serpent the Beast right and brother way that spoken se he said every every every person whether you're a pope priest king whatever you are you're born between Satan and Eve let me let me read it this really this really something this is Brother Brandman spoken words you read to see let me read it real quickly see how much time I've got wor what happened to eeve Children what happened to that's right it's supposed to come right right so it turns right around in Genesis 13 after the fall here they are leaving the garden of e their bloody skins sosing down their legs walking out and heart brother God's he just broke God's heart he looked to see his daughter and son walking out there right and he screamed out the seed of the woman will take his thing back that's what he's doing right now is sure I stand here he's taking it back we take the kingdom back we lost if God placed a man on the earth here with no sin no unbelief right there he was if God started that way he'll end up that way he absolutely do it he he said in his word he'll do it now think of this what happened to Eve's children she hbed y but this bride down here the second Eve she ain't going to high breed why God said she wasn't go on it's already predestinated determined that she'll be there amen amen now look the first one born now multiply to his bride Adam's bride replenish the Earth that's was God's commission what would have be done if he fixed that made themselves kept themselves together what happened when Adam got ready to come to her she's already a mother y see the servant already got to her that's the only thing could happen you said it wasn't that way well why is everybody dying right Amen to take God's origion the word you ain't going to die exactly right now the same thing happened to Christ Church Christ bride see we're

and walked out of Victorious over everything that's what the son of man that was his third pull come on he preached six seals the word he couldn't preach nothing else come on there he Stills the word of God the Tree of Life how many believe the bride's the tree of life you're promise that you are she's the Tree of Life Hallelujah they walked and she it's end time Brides according to him will do the same thing praise God's name forever amen I feel like I preach all afternoon now prise God for that the brother what he said that brother H's son Richard where you raise your hand I I a't seen you in a long time I I just I see him sitting there good to see you brother all you other brothers brother Jimmy there and my two sons and their families come down I appreciate that and brother Jimmy turn this service out to come up here and and in this we just going to have a good shout and have Hallelujah good Pentecostal Revival meeting that's what it is not organization we I don't I don't like that the Pentecost is God that's what we're going to have God's the word right all right now let me hurry here now see he's goes back he went back to original we we come here wrong see see she gave to him and he ate he knew what he's doing Adam knew what he's doing because he's the word he wasn't a transgression he know what he's doing right right see and there he forfeited a title deed the book went back to eternal life on the earth went back to God with no way back think of this the Tree of Life reminded Adam he was keeping his youth see now if he had stay she had stayed with her word husband they would have had her and they would have eat from the same Tree of Life when Jesus Christ came on Earth this is all to tell you this whole thing when Jesus Christ come on the earth 2,000 years ago he was that tree of life there's the tree of life that the Adam and the woman should eat from not his flesh that word that theop word he didn't B he was God he was the fullest of the godhead bod the whole godhead was in him he was that tree is in the garden so he said brother Brandon that's the tree she that's the tree they would produced if it eat from it yes there stood in FL there's the tree that's why he said the bride's the Tree of Life abolutely Hallelujah that's exactly true next my I want to I'm almost speak in tongues I I do sometime down in the basement but I'm now working out I get shouting going on and this so nobody else is around I can just do it exactly right nobody else's business right anyway it's really something toelle about see the tree the tree he reminded him now if the woman had to sa with her husband let me hurry here see they they would e that tree that means they would have replenished the Earth right they would have multiplied there there have been another Adam another Son of God because Adam the the New Testament Adam was a Son of God Amen they would had sons of God that's why it was Christ and Moses Christ and Abraham Christ that was one seed all the way down through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation but listen we're still here amen we're still dying amen come on we still had got it back yet but thank God is coming that's why I'm saying there's a new day daing someone as sure as I stand Here someone's going to make this word live yes sir so that part of the tree thou was the part of the tree now listen thou stood the part of the tree that never e now Eve said I got a man from the Lord she got Cain he belonged to the devil same his father but abble needed a sacrifice he did he was born he was born H he wasn't the right son praise God for that part would have brought see that that part would have brought forth another son like him a Son of God which is Christ the word without death in him but from the very time Satan has won the from that very time now here's a great statement it's going to be hard maybe to understand some of you I hope you everyone here stand it from the very hour the very time that Eve hbid that word and mixed it when you hybrate anything you mix anything God's not a mixer he's a separator he hold that word the time you breath it that HB that thing you die the fruit from that is hybrid that's why you're sitting here today some of you real gray-headed somebody getting older I'm old because what I'm standing that way because E's hybriding that's the very reason but if you had had hadn't done that God couldn't fully Express himself amen didn't make her do it but he knew she would do it God even know he knew we'd be sitting here this afternoon this morning he know he knew every thought he knew every word I'd say before I say him you can't tell him nothing he don't know I heard brother Dale preach that you know he got Liv in the past remember that see but from the very time Satan got Eve's mind that's where he chooses the Mind Satan does the very minut he pregnated her mind and got her mind he had her from that very hour this is seven seal quote from the seventh seal Satan has won the victory over the word ever since right can you see it Satan has won the victory over the word ever since amen amen we're still standing here mortal we weren't supposed to be death doomed we weren't supposed to die people here God put down here the live he gave him a book he he was a he was a titled deed to eternal life if he wanted a mountain move he can move it but you know what Adam he got every there it's a week or something he can move mountains he can move trees but he couldn't say the word he didn't say the word no he he went Eve's way to save her because his love for her like the C the second Eve went to calary because of the love he never become a sinner Adam he lost it when that second Adam come he didn't lose it he pray on hold a minute only thing PR it on hold three days hold it up at three days cuz I got power to lay my life down and I got power to take it up again you know what he's doing you know what that was he seconding pull right that's right that was his second pull his first pull was Healing The Sick be to say my father's one they said you be a man make yourself God that was his second pull his third pull proved it cuz Easter morning there he stood but man said there stood the real Jesus Hallelujah Eternal Body Spirit and soul there there's the one we we reproduce we'll get that in a minute hallelujah praise God forever I got to look at my wall my goodness I wish I just whole time stop it you can't do that I yes right we want we going to though it's what time and turn is going to blend right didn't amen see the whole human race fell that says God has perit God permitted it see it's like he told Noah y see after the flood he said Noah multiply replenish the Earth right now the atonement hadn't come yet we know that from way back there what could he what did he repl replenish the Earth with what did Brother Braham say he replenish the Earth with anybody know serpent seed amen he said can't you see serpent seed amen that's what he said amen In the Flesh now come on Amen you come to say you come Paul says if one died for all wouldn't all dead and he said in Ephesians 2 we were listen to Paul Apostle Paul we were by Nature the children of Wrath right the nature nature sin real even as others yes amen we fail just like we all fa but here we had representation put our name in the land B of through his for knowledge four know the only way you preach it Hallelujah you come here with something in you how can you bring the seed of God through adultery right you can't do that and they do it you can't do that right amen Garden Of God showed that in the garden of Eve when he done what she done there is the word left the book went back he will the word of God will not Hy bre how many knows that it won't do it it won't mix praise God for they can call it the word of God but it's not the word if it don't produce Christ again it's not the word because Christ is the word that's a fact brother the truth the end time life vindicates and proves that God in Christ is the same person it's exactly what it is now he come to permission will Lord have mercy to replenish Earth of servant in the flesh Bast born that's rough isn't it that's right say don't don't don't don't identify me that old serpent seed yeah you got born through Mom and Daddy you didn't come right you come like Jesus come you got be all right he's got to take something out of you before he'll come in himself that's why you got certification satification he'll take it out of you you you'll come in exactly right let me hurry and get get to my end this see job 19 say if I know my ever see all right now let me skip it little it see the BR the seed of the woman the told maybe bruise means atonement bruise A Serpent's head and that down here really people down here is really where it happens that Jesus Paid the price don't get me wrong he had a perfect min the son of man right see he come and he conquered death Hell In The Grave amen absolutely that's right and come back on the de Pentecost as Son of God right but people still keeps dying naturally Saints don't die we know that amen that's right but the people in the flesh you'll die they're dying right something's got to happen righten amen now the word had to be fulfilled you had to go through seven ages seven sabes all these things that had to happen but we're down to the end the Sabbath is over it's time now to be grown up people Sons and Daughters of God with the maturity of the word because our sheep listen to what brother say our sheath that comes out of your habitation that's waved goes to a loaf of bread amen other words he takes his strong in you he becomes flesh in you in son of man right amen what brother r t anyway exactly what it is you'll never leave out of here as Son of God you won't do it you can't do it right praise God forever praise God see see see the the see of the woman come back no sex at all right he didn't have to die because he came from the original way but see he had to die though but he didn't have to die no you know what he was you know what Jesus Christ is really that he's the cross of Chasm yeah he was actually standing there by Revelation in the Garden of Eden cuz he was the tree that was in Becka I said about Revelation not by AC not by flesh but by Revelation he's cross he's cross he came over here and died amen he I come from God I go back to God right I can prove that in a few minutes if I can I get my time have my time to see he didn't have to die because he had no unbelief he come right he come by the word so if he come by the word he wouldn't have die he could not die even though he's Immortal he couldn't have died but he had to because he said this cause come out into the world John 12 right that's what he is and he died he took my place in death your place in death Listen People sin a friend anywh it's here it's not right right if you're sin here the t is made amen he took your place all you have to do accept it don't you have to do something you can't do anything to Merit it he already merited for you you I'm I'm through of sin I'm through my life on I'm gonna give my life to God I'm turning around exactly what you got to do Absol it'll happen amen be a new new new new creation New Creation amen see now look because he come to region what he never by prous theop he was the morphe word he was an morphe now listen to this he wasn't a Murphy word body before he become flesh yes amen yeah he was amen that's the difference between him and you as a son I'm quoting brother Bri who's M he was an imorph word body you came from attribute to flesh right amen not attribute to and no you was going to come after the fall he knew you was going to come through sex desire that's right you couldn't come through sex desire and and and have your the off in it you had the first thing to clean that old birth out of you Hallelujah absolutely that's right that's right that's the difference between him and you that's what brother R said he was at word body before he came from that word body when Abraham met him who was he right he was a theop form what brother said when Moses saw the back part of him what was it he's the mor he the back part a man God's not a woman he's a man come on a woman never come on on day of Pentecost what he the Holy Ghost has come hallelujah praise God forever absolutely see so he was at he was at more word body before he become flesh did he come see he never by theity you did but through the new birth hallu he put that you birth back to you then what you start coming the same way he come you coming by the word like he come by the word but you got to be cleaned up he didn't have he have to be cleaned up he was clean that's right he he was the birth right right amen there's the tree there's the tree of life if they had produced that child they would have never died right amen amen that's right right yeah she he was there you know so I'm not leave my soul in hell that's one scripture he went he went on right right see my Holy One see corruption he also spoke in his second in his second pool Ministry no man takes my life he said second pool now amen he had first pool he had first second pool right no man takes about I my father one when you see me you seen the father just every already got him he did exactly what the Messiah supposed to do see I got I got see I I got power to lay my life down I got power to take it up again right take his table down and three days all raise it back up see that was his second pull prophesy he was propes sign yes amen he spoke it and he went and done it amen see there he stood the word there stood the tree that even Adam should eat from right amen see if they had have stayed with the word they'd have brought forth that tree they brought forth the tree of life so someone down here brings forth the tree of life because they're ordained to stay with the word absolutely see here have never been see sub SE in it see right see he would have been word Sons Christ the word right they said will you at this time restore the kingdom you know son of David Kingdom he that's not given to me to know the father only the spirit God see now he died son of man he raised Son of God and through Seven Ages then just before the Earth burns the son of man is revealed again I read it to you minut ago this brings the perfect ministry of the son of man right I just read it to you both places that's your ministry but he'll be so small he said so little that people Overlook it how look how they Overlook Christ he done every side he could do to show who he was but they still couldn't see him they was blind a person is blind they're blind amen see now we know that Jesus Christ was that seed child that even Adam was to birth see this seed is the is the woman is the Tree of Life contrary to serpent seed it was contrary to your sex birth this new birth is contrary very very contrary to your first birth that's right now through seven Church ages he's Son of God Spirit God that's the father Stone see father the fire our fathers never eat from this tree of life that we eat from got quiet they never read it they had they had a bride there he had one he could take am I brother but God let him go a little while like he did Eve he let it go a little while first thing you know what happened they let the church and the church at Pentecost W up in NAIA come on so they never eat from that tree no sir then they were not really really original son because Paul said himself in Romans 8 we're waiting for the sons of God to come to what to W understand the Redemption of our body and they never got it back there but Paul said prophesied he said it'll happen at the last trumpet for that trumpet was sound I don't mean to scream but I guess hallelujah it's all right a they didn't get it it that's right no one's ever got it that's why it say it's different down here it's just different am am amen it's a secret yes God told Daniel 12 he said seal it seal the words to When time of the end and by every one you can't don't tell me this the the apostles had the Thunders they had p they had partial word they spoke in part they had the true word of God I agree but they never heard no Thunders that was directed to brother bandam and no one else the seventh angel Revelations 10 that holds the mission it goes with the seven seal and it's coming three things goes together the seven seal the seven seal the seven Thunders and it's coming that's why he said in Christ the mystery God revealed I ain't going to be able to get to right that's exactly what it is seven sail seven Thunders is coming what brings you here the word what brings Christ here present with you and me amen it's the opening of the word that's right so when brother BR preached Christ toiss got revealed he say he said we understand right here this morning while heaven was silent and seven Thunders under voices he said he's coming he said John wouldn't Couldn't Write the the seven Thunders he said he coming he said in preaching the seven seal Brother D preach it that seven seal is the third poor did he say that you sure did it's the third poor yes yesen preach all saath all all three PA when the preach that week of the seventh seal brother Bram he said there's one part I can't understand when unkknown tongues I couldn't make out what it was but when he preached Christ the Myster of God reveal he preached all three he was preaching the third poor do you see me you understand it when he got to the end of it he didn't know what he was doing but never knew it to the Holy Spirit we come in and oh this what this he looked at the clock and that's right that Holy Spirit knows everything that Holy but har he was looking at you that Holy still has you in his mind yes sir he look at the clock the end of the second pool right he just preached the third pool he's a the end of the second po amen H that's Hallelujah hold on I ain't through yet I'll get through minut okay brother brother see when he done that go in the book went back we lost our inheritance yes did see I think God get that's Jubilee I want to hit on this just a second we're now in 70th Jubilee amen amen in the Old Testament back there when a person got poor he couldn't pay his taxes or something whatever happened he lost his old home place so on he he went and hired out another Hebrew and worked for him so long but when God called The Jubilee every 49 years he called it 49 is not the Jubilee you'll never go in a Rapture on the 49 that's why shows the said Church you can't be in the church as and go to the Rapture no sir he the Rapture is 50 am but see God called you ever 49 years then the 50th year he said God called brother say brother brand now he said God give that 50th Jubilee by grace to that person that lost their inheritance that's you and me but he come what that headstone say am Grace Grace our inheritance comes back not just Eternal to the Earth amen and that Tu when that trumpet sounded he said I throw that ho down I can go back it don't cost him one red SC he Lo he gets everything he gets his family and everything he lost when he when he had to leave praise God's name forever I haven't lost I ain't even lost I got a ball part back there I ain't lost a high that's right come on how can you lose anything you can't do it that's sir that's it praise God forever I feel kind of young now here's what I want you to see hold on minute see now you look at this it's a prophetic gift on the earth yes here we are in the 70th that's why 77 a little brother told me the other day he said we talking and he said my P said that brother Bram said he predicted 77 be the end of all things I don't get scared I ain't going to tell you something he says he said he all these seven Visions things should be finished and everything in the Rapture by 77 but he said he didn't happen so I said brother you missed it I said brother Braham says the seven is 7 was the 7 this Jubilee how brother ra believed it how your brother Dale did Brother Dale senior not Junior it's the 70s Jubilee the going up of the Gentile bride that J said what freedom I can go back to what I F in the Garden of Eden I can go back to eternal life Hallelujah exactly what it that's exactly what it is what else can it be amen that's right amen amen I'll let it go on that but here what I want you to see so be prop give on the earth to bring to the people and brother Bram said on that first stand on the first seal now he says he stands here says a redeemed Son of God on that first seal he said here stands the Lamb with a book in his hand now that was a truth or is a lie it was a truth am amen see if the lamb takes the book he takes the book because redemption's over see redemption's over at the end of six seals six seals finishes Redemption they a nothing wrote they anything else wrote right come on it's finished Redemption right so he said here stands a lamb with a book amen and what actually happened the S seal took that book actually Christ actually took his throne and brother brandom Redemption was over for him exactly if he hadn't said second pull yeah we wouldn't be here that's right do you hear me if he hadn't said that we know what a prophet is we ain't careful he's the next thing to God and he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand it was the book Adam had amen absolutely amen the book yes produced another Son of God in the very image of God that's where he was how many say Amen to that that's exactly the truth had done that yeah then God see he would he' been like Enoch he took him in the r and we' been left now come on but he like eler he sent him to get a bride Hallelujah Brother D bless your heart amen he a blood brother to me he's got the same Mom and Daddy I got exactly right no matter what Co you skin is we're the same family one in Christ exactly what it is absolutely it can't fail right brother now I'm going to read your a statement that brother Ram said it it's does my soul good I don't want to read this I want to read another one hold on a minute you got to give me a little slack cuz I'm I'm kind of getting a little old I said a little okay now amen let me read this first it's on the fourth seal now he preached down in 63 3:21 I believe when that sin will be broke up when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ now listen brother Braham is preaching his own experience that's right amen he's partaker of this he's not a hypocrite right this is him yes it is he says the lamb s you he knew exactly what he was saying it's it's like Drop In A drw Black Ink into a bunch of choric bleach it breaks into the chemicals send it back to where it come from you can't see it it's gone it's annihilated it's gone now this what he's saying h man I you probably said I'm preaching the the choir I know that you know right I know that good that's why the blood of Jesus Christ what the blood of Jesus Christ does yes amen now what's the blood of Jesus Christ what when a man is really to confess like brother Bob mention things there it's really to confess and God really cleanse the person and takes him through the word amen and takes anything him that's not right cuz as many as are let by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and no one else when he's cleansed yes yes you know where he's at how many knows where he's at when that man is truly cleansed right he has no sin he broke up he's took back on the devil you know where he's standing across the chasm amen do you hear me he standing across the chasm am he stands back out where Adam and Eve stood by Revelation and that's exactly what he had produced another Son of God there he stood it's cleans all the way abstract there's nothing against it and brother BR said you're back across the chasm Hallelujah that's right you have no sin praise God's name forever exactly what it is am and that's exactly where brother Braham stood yes there was a Son of God he stood he said here's the book y because we the book don't never forget that you're the one that's being redeemed amen you hear me exactly right amen see so because see and then it puts him across the chasm that's why I you're in another day amen amen amen they something happened amen right like when brother BR preached Christ things that ought to be all those it reunion that's not the Sinners redemption's over he's telling you how he done it he's showing you what you really are you never sin in the first place when you really truly sin it don't exist there's no record You' ever married to that man do you hear what I'm saying there's no record of it praise God forever see that that create see then that son across the CM has the creative power of God in him amen and he'll bring a brother Wade the pastor he'll bring the word to you to make you a created son and daughter of God in the very image and likeness of almighty God and God's the word amen if you don't want that you come from the wrong place you're going to the wrong place exactly right what it is can't be no anyway hold on a minute that's what he says he's a created Son of God now and that's the fourth seal here's the same thing on the second seal when you say the people say they got the Holy Ghost deny this word there something wrong the Holy Ghost wrote the word now the Holy Ghost attribute how many know that's the attribute you that was you right how many know that the the attribute of the Holy Ghost would come down and got you that what brother BR said what he is as he expressed only way you natur be expressed in Christ and Christ is the Holy Ghost same person right exactly right if a man has my spirit in him he'll do my works you want to read that you want to put it down St John 14:12 the works I do you do also right right then he Sanctified and cleansed so he can stand before God Amen you can't stand before God with sin come on that drop of ink Falls there takes him across the chasm amen amen what is that blood of that's the blood of Jesus Christ that literally cleanses you your actually your actually nature you had comes out of you it dies every spe dies because why You' tuck across back across the C Adam and Eve is in a place where there's no sin it'll be the same thing to you and me we'll stand you on this Earth with no sin at all we won't go in the Rapture not a speck of sin will go in the Rapture unbelief that's what it is not one Speck will go in that'll make everybody in your sh that ain't nothing but not because I say it because the word says it exactly right we stand in place see now I asked you a question then this is going to really get you yes they it over the Bible says in in in uh second Corinthians 5 that said we're made the very righteousness of God in him then you tell me the difference in between me and him that's right tell me the difference you brother and him that's right you're clear back right you've come the same way he come you may have he is righteous as he is then what's the difference sir what is it amen there ain't no difference you know that that's why we do the works we'll do his works because we're him made manifest if Brother D didn't preach anything he preached that we him made manifest amen exactly right so here said a man had preached a complete mystery and Christ The Mystery of God he preached a complete secret he kept it a secret for brother brand the lik angel messenger he preached that complete thing he was redeemed he was literally by Revelation standing in the same place Adam stood because he said here stand the Lamb with the book it was the book Adam had when he was across the C over praise God's name forever Hallelujah can you believe that you got to it you've got to see not botion no through humility and reverence and a Godly life see that he's made you as righteous as he is he's he's actually give himself to you he can do it he can forget it I can't I can do something brother he can't never forget it he can forgive me but he's human he can but God can forget it he's the only one one can right and he has Hallelujah God see forgetfulness praise God's name forever praise God you believe it I believe you do then listen we're responsible for it our life we live if the life is not there it's just a bunch of stuff in your brain it's got to be the same life he lives am because it's the same brother in that message it's the same book and it has to be the same life he live praise God forever if you want to be there you can don't care who you are I this don't understand God will give you to understand he'll give you enough to get you out of here if you want to get out of his man you'll get it hallelujah praise God's name forever yes you believe it see now listen what brother Bram did and he preached Christ as a Miss God he's at the seventh seal why he's silent that's Daniel 12 there's a lot of things happen Daniel 12 I say a lot of things I better shut up on that but a lot of things he said seal it seal it till the time of end what's the s seal It's the End of Time of all things it's the end of times seal it ends time of everything you hear me seals V place even that's end the Millennium right it ends it yes praise God forever amen amen that's exactly right now listen it's the most Sublime thing thing the most Sublime happening in the scriptures that's right now he say in the entire scriptures what here stands a lamb with a book in his hand I there goes some other person y right cu the lamb and the holy SP and the person holy ghost in the Christ is the same person abely say mostly in the scriptures that he preached Christ is no was no he wasn't preaching history no right Christ is the mystery of God revealed basing it on the entire Bible amen right entire Bible because it's the the complete Plan of Redemption Heaven and Earth and body everybody right and he based on the entire Bible and his 30 years of ministry in the second pool he said when you this this is why I've said what I've said and done what I've done all the years of the Tabernacle this is why Christ is come in the flesh change it a little bit before it was Christ is the mystery of God reveal who does he reveal that amen and you brother Hall thank praise God forever I'm going to read one more quote and I'll quit I promise you amen let me turn over here this is souls in prison this is this kind of see what I'm trying to say this is this is November I think November yeah November 10 1363 a few months after he preached the see he preached said you know the Christ of mystery and in that Christ of mystery he said if you miss what I've said remember that if you miss what I've said what 30 years of preaching this is why Christ is the mystery of God revealed what he say you're revealed your attribute you are revealed in Christ through Christ every attribute is revealed through only in Christ only in Christ is he a Healer that's right only in high in Christ is he a savior only in Christ is the good one only in Christ is he a new creation right amen amen amen then what that makes you a new creation Christ for this day right amen exactly right praise God forever let me read this now H yes it's not a coincidence it's on page 50 that's jubile souls in prison see now that's

look at the scriptures piled in here could it be is the third pool preach to Eternal doomed that's rejected work of Salvation it is and it climbs out the same way it's the brid's ministry because the first Ministry and last minist is the same so he said Christ Jesus closed out the F he fulfilled the Old Testament did he say that am who fulfills all the New Testament amen the bride so it has to

seven seal that's where you stand right you have to stand there with no sin amen cuz you're seal with the book The book's six seals amen yes sir the seventh seal brings him back to Earth you hear me what Earth this Earth here first brings you back to this earth right here he become flesh the seven where see the lamb come back and took the book out of the right hand of him that said and sat down the lamb in Christ the Holy Ghost same person he said he took the book took the book that's the book Adam had sat down and claim what he owned what he had redeemed redemption's over right is that right it's always been that third pool and listen what he says here's a good one free is perfection the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduce Christ again in the natural among human beings now I ask you where's that at nobody stood where he's standing where he's standing there nobody don't no sir he reproduced Christ again and he could have took that man the Rapture but he come like John right now look what he said what he have redeemed is that right it's always been that third pool as it was predicted in the scripture I'm quitting I'm not going to look at my watch I'm afraid I went too long let's Stand Together God bless you I want don't quit there Amen Let stand of sing a song anybody need prayer if you're a sinner if anyone needs the Lord maybe I said something that would that would stir your heart up because I don't believe if you if you ain't right with God I don't believe you got along to get right in it's I ain't saying the door is closed I'm saying it's getting closed Brothers it's a horrible we're living in a horrible day we got a f but I tell you we got people now they they care nothing about Christianity at all they hate they hate anything that's right it's against it that thing closes brother I'll tell you one he'd be a chilling experience brother to find out wake up someday brother and say that it's over I thought a Rapture SP you missed it that's a horrible that's a horrible you ever think about amen we'll sing as a course little course I'll turn to brother way amen amen in the Hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] God oface our TR V our hearts are

V oh our hearts [Music] are we in the [Music] presence oh of the [Music] king oh in the presence of [Music] je oh God almightyy he the Prince of Peace [Music] our TR Vish oh our hearts are meing for it's in the presence all [Music] the amen let's give our [Applause] brother you know there was U there was an old black man one time brother R said he had to about crawl up to the pull pit and start preaching you see brother Richard he was just limping up here limping up here he ain't limping no more you want limping during that service from his mouth or his leg amen that was a full Barrel we sure appreciate we appreciate him love him love the Lord I um if the Lord parries and I get your age I'd rather just stay up here and preach all day and get the feeling here than to have to go back there and feel that feel that serenty back there in you flesh but we sure appreciate Brother Richard and and what he stood for and and you know did y y'all realize you look in the news that tomorrow six planets are going to line [Music] up my man they lined up today he lined it up six seals finish his Redemption those six go out and then there nothing but eternity from then on we come to that time Hallelujah God will prove it in the sky he proved it here that there'll six planets line up tomorrow night and it'll happen another time or two but timing is just perfect perfect and we appreciate Brother Richard and U you know when when I first started ministering um you were here for the dedication for that when I first announced my call to minister and he he prayed over me then he actually was here to uh when we bu bu the building on toward the back and and then I announced my call to preach and he prayed then and that's been 20 something years ago and the words never got any weaker it's always got stronger [Music] amen the what he out here okay let's open the door [Music] this whole place was built on this man right here it wasn't built on a man it was built on Christ but it has to come through a vessel it has to come through not an angel it has to come through a man and brother Dale gave his life for you he studied when we played he studied some more when we played some more he gave his life so that we can stand here today and honor him and also start a new era that I I appreciate the Lord giving us this great Foundation amen and we have found a we we we found a place that that we can come here and we can feel safe as Brother Richard said feel at home he said he feels like his second home I really I know he does and it all was when brother Dale stood years and years ago when nobody else would stand he stood for the [Applause] work and though and though that U that we've come to this time and you you're you're seeing this the the part that that Hannah and Sam Dale produced but there's a man inside there yes that's just as Eternal as God is and just emptied itself out for a group of people so that we can stand here today and you can hear wonderful preaching like this like brother Jimmy Harris and different ones brother Steven all the ones that we all come up under this right and we really we really uh you know you could have come up under a lot different yeah I know that you know that so do I we could have come under a lot different but God saw the desire in our heart to attach ourself to somebody that knew how to preach the word of God and preach it without any hesitation and not having to ask for permission I believe God gave him the permission when he called him he gave him permission to speak the word of God just like tonight today he gave Brother Richard the permission to speak the word of God and he just stepped out of the way and God just took over and preached the sermon right I asked you the other day brother Ram asked us one time he said are we impressed are we impressed with this message are we significantly impressed with what we hold in our hand it's Eternal it's what God saw it's what God wanted and I'm sure he was standing there cheerleading for Adam but he knew Adam wasn't going to do it cuz remember God can't change his mind if he loved Adam to begin with he's got to love him now right right remember the saying I said the other day you know I've give God a million reasons to hate me and he still loves me cuz he can't change his mind if we're that attribute as Brother Richard said if we're that attribute God can't change his mind and say no I made a mistake I picked the wrong one no he never will do that never has made a mistake and never will but we we have brother Dale here with us today we're going to eat downstairs we're going to do have the ordination service now if all the um a ones would come up that would uh that's part of the spiritual leadership of the church which would be me and brother Bob brother Aaron Brother Louise brother Terrence brother Ryan Brother Gary CR brother Robert Dy and sister Lisa you need to go get her too she's a secretary Traer if y'all will come up front please and U I know we have board of directors and all that but that's not an ordained according to to what brother random U gave us is the spiritual leadership of the church this is the spiritual leadership of the church and I believe that God has has give us a place and a position and and look at all this he's give around us he's give us uh and I I apologize for for The Gap that we've had between when Brother Richard was here and brother Jimmy Harris was here you see what you've been missing they know how to preach we listen to all these other people but they know how to preach they preach with anointing and they preach the truth and brother Jimmy it'd be an honor if you'd come up here with us please brother and and he is a um has a a church there in uh Riverdale I guess or somewhere close to there and if you'll come up here with us brother Jimmy he started his ministry and he took a a group of people and he's leading them on to the coming of the Lord and we sure do we haven't had them in this building in a long time but we sure do appreciate them in their stand for the word of God and I I'm I'm going to ask them to pray over each one of us that has a position in this church it's going to be hard I told y'all long you know before when we had our meeting the uh you know the days of playing is over the days of of coasting is over as Brother Richard was saying we' got to push we got to we got to go that's the third pull we're there's a pull coming that's here now that's pulling us but you know what it's pulling us to where we know where it's pulling us to right we're a group of people that know what's going on I just believe that we're we're not guessing we're not it's not happen chance it's not brother Richard's going to just preach on this and no it was anointed of God to preach what he preached today and and all of us we we sit and we we study and and we we toil just bring you 30 or 40 minutes hour hour and a half service so let's bind together all right God's ordained it to be this way this is the way it's going to be until God changes it and when God changes it that's all right with me but until he does brother Jimmy come up here with us if you don't mind brother and you pray over all of us come on God bless you brother he just lost his daughter a couple days ago and we helped do the funeral I appreciate them calling off their service enough to come up here and be a part of this I wanted to be a part of this service cuz he's been a part of my life too all these men mold you and make you into what you are if you'll let them kids let them don't try to think you can do this all by yourself I can't do this all by myself when I got to wh brother Dale I couldn't talk to him and get counsel from him all the other brothers these brothers are now going to really be a help to me cu the door has been open I'm the pastor now I can decide who comes here and who don't come here that's the way you decided it amen and and I'm going to ask you please to to pray over all these um ministers and deacons and and trustees and and we appreciate y'all both coming man we love you both with the love of the Lord I I have I've been waiting for this day for a long time a long time this is us say the Lord yeah it was it's meant to be brother I know I know I know there was something said back in the he what he's referring to in the dedication service that he did in whatever was 98 or 9999 99 and he referred back and told me he said D did you remember what your daddy said back then I said no that been 1999 he said go back and find it brother Joe found a tape for me and Brother Richard was preaching and it was preaching on how Solomon built the house took him built the house took it on and built a house David couldn't do it remember and Solomon built a house and dad got up behind him and he said that ain't nothing but thus said the Lord the son built the house and it's on T if you want to listen to it Dad get got dad gets up and stand he said that's nothing but thus sayith the Lord and he reminded me of that so this day had to come it's like I said this day had to come I mean you can love me or hate me we love you one way or the other but but this has been ordained here we love you too this is ordained this way so I appreciate all of you thank you for your vote of confidence thank you for um uh having a a will to come and and listen to brother Bob and brother Lise and brother Aaron and all the different one brother Ryan teaches we just got a good group of people it's like brother um um bcll was preaching that service we had I think it was 06 down in in Gainesville and and he he he was talking about the people that he had around him and and he he said you know he said you know you got a pretty good stable of horses amen you got a good Stable horses you you're proud of them when you got a good Stable horses and I'm proud of all these I'm not calling you a horse or but I'm I appreciate all of you you're the voice this is the final voice of the final age they're going to hear you're not going to hear it from anybody else right all right it's the Bride of Jesus Christ preaching the word of God so I I would appreciate if you brothers would U everybody kind of gather a little bit closer together everyone pray and and brother if you'd lead and you'd pray too and pray over these and we're going to do it together not individually so we can save some time and then I want all of you to B together cuz Satan's going to try to rip us apart he's going to try to rip you apart he's going to try to do it but he can't do it it's like Brother Richard said if it's if it's predestinated and ordained it's going to work and the Bible's already predestinated from the foundation of the world so he can't change all right and I love you and I appreciate you I want to be that servant I'll take up an offering anytime I don't care it don't bother me a bit but that's what we are we're servants to the people and if anytime you need anything I've got these two I can depend on now and and feel free to talk to them anytime I want to and and some of the other brothers but if you need anything if you're having problems and issues let's talk about it let's be in love with each other let's don't let's don't let that root of bitterness Drive in a wedge in and separate us apart let's don't let's don't do that so so let's bind together that everything does if it ever does come let's get it out of there cuz it has a root in it and the only way to kill a plant is take get the root out of the ground all right so if there's anything going on like that then let's pray these brothers right here powerful Ministers of God and they have a Ministry and a piece of the ministry to going forward right and we sure appreciate them so if you want mind your brother y'all go ahead and let's bind together we don't lay hands on you to give you a gift no that's right God give you that for that's right yeah like Paul Char Timothy that's why I was thinking about that this morning that's right I'll give you my right hand of Fellowship he said one brother he said long as you stay with the word right that's what I want you to live I if I don't say the word kick me out that's right to me first right that's right tell me cuz I want to be right right am that giil serve before the foundation amen that's right

thank you so much for calling your service off and bringing your your group with you and we sure appreciate brother Chris has been here he he he's about teren and him about the same height but he always sat back there where Terence was at when he was uh here and uh he about to fill a seat up now now but he got married and got a baby or a child but we good good to see you again good to see that that we see people that we've seen from a long time they haven't seen for a long time and they're still continuing on they're still coming to church they're still reading their Bible oh yeah we got problems so what it's like Brother Richard says like I've always said do the thing do the right things like brother Bob do what your conscience tells you is what you read out of the word of God the world does their they have a conscience cuz they read what's out there right and molds together with them well like Brother Richard said if we're going to be the word then the word's got to mold to the word we can't let anything get between that if we are the word made manifest we are going to read the word of God and be happy reading it and be happy coming to church I was uh I was watching brother Claude wi singer yesterday and uh he said you know what he said we should be happy to come to church some people feel it's a drudgery but we should be happy to come am this is what makes me happy is to come here if you'll get the Holy Ghost like that then the church pews will fill up with Holy Ghost fill people cuz you want the word of God because the word has to become flesh and it can't become flesh send it home press and play sorry about that ain't going to happen takes fivefold Ministry takes five folds of this map to unfold the map to see what's going on and to use every one of them as a gift to get us out of here God bless you I don't know are they are they ready maybe okay listen visitors eat first we got plenty of food they're seating outside if you can't sit inside out up under the Pavilion I think God's G us a real day that's not 90° Georgia weather so um you can sit outside and and fellowship one with another tell our brother how much you appreciate him and brother Jimmy these pastors that have come and all of you eat fellowship and good to have brother Dale with us one more time up front where he's been all these years but God has continued to bless him so he's going to continue to bless us he blessed us with a message and that message is for us to carry on to the coming of the Lord and as Brother Richard said it's a new era it's a new time amen not a new way of thinking no no no it's taking that thought and making it manifest amen amen the thought that God had before the foundation of the world is brother Dale preach in 1995 matching pieces whatever match God's mind got to match down here when it does we'll leave we'll get out of here so God bless you let me let's uh pray and and over the food and just continue like I said visitors go
