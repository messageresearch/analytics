[0:45] eye open eyes of my heart eyes of my
[0:54] heart I want to see
[0:59] I want to see you see him I don't
[1:04] believe the world opening eyes of my
[1:10] heart
[1:13] open the eyes of my heart
[1:17] [Music]
[1:27] to say hi and lift and
[1:35] shining in the light of your glory
[1:40] pour out your power and love as we say

[1:52] day
[1:54] [Applause]
[1:56] shining in OH
[2:02] [Music]
[2:06] holy holy
[2:09] [Music]
[2:33] and I want to understand you that's what
[2:37] that songs about not see physically we
[2:39] will seem physically but we got to
[2:40] understand him first I was we were I was
[2:46] listening to the radio yesterday I
[2:49] believe it was and they were talking
[2:52] about Jesus and even when you hear him
[2:56] talk it's yeah this man was 2000 years
[2:59] ago and yeh saved my soul and and yeah
[3:02] but yeah but he's like he's back there
[3:05] he's not here you know I mean he's he's
[3:09] not they say yeah he's living inside of
[3:12] me but they really don't know how and I
[3:14] written you know then I the scripture
[3:16] came back to my mind that where Jesus
[3:19] said they'll say Jesus Jesus or the
[3:21] Prophet said that won't get anything and
[3:23] then also all of a sudden you read the
[3:24] Bible where it says they'll come and say
[3:25] I've done all these things in your name
[3:28] all these mighty works I did in your
[3:31] name he said depart from me I never knew
[3:35] you I never had an intimate relationship
[3:38] with you that's what you and I are we
[3:40] need to make sure we're having an
[3:42] intimate relationship not just in the
[3:44] cleanness because a lot of people if the
[3:47] foolish virgins going to be in it's just
[3:49] an acquaintance they come to a place
[3:50] that they get acquainted with God
[3:52] people get acquainted with the message
[3:54] but do they ever have it in here from
[3:58] here to here it's got to come from here
[4:00] to here brother Joe's got a chart he
[4:04] pulled up from way back when where it
[4:06] shows memories and conscious affects an
[4:09] imagination where it's got to be
[4:10] connected all through here but it's got
[4:12] to come from the heart
[4:13] comes from the heart then everything is
[4:15] everything working out fine so then we
[4:17] will know it
[4:19] Jesus said this world won't see me
[4:21] anymore but you'll see me in other words
[4:24] you'll know me you'll have an intimate
[4:26] relationship with me but all what a
[4:28] great time but when we get to see him in
[4:30] person we get to see the man all right
[4:33] I'll tell you a little story
[4:35] another thing you wonder how the world
[4:38] is doing I kind of figured out I went to
[4:40] the dentist Tuesday I guess it was and
[4:43] had a root canal of course that takes a
[4:45] couple hours so you're
[4:46] there you know and you know me even with
[4:48] a mouthful of cotton I can't keep my
[4:49] mouth shut
[4:50] so um or they couldn't keep my mouth
[4:52] shut that way me anyway this little girl
[4:55] was sitting there and she's you know
[4:56] talking to me and she says I went and
[4:58] visited this church the other day and
[5:00] she said I don't know if we're going
[5:02] back or not I said why just something
[5:05] there said no their service was two
[5:07] hours long I just looked up at her and I
[5:13] said our services are always two hours
[5:15] long she said two hours long and she
[5:19] just kept on and on and on I said you'll
[5:21] sit and watch she's from the University
[5:22] of Florida bless her heart but she she
[5:26] got a degree there and left so that's a
[5:28] good thing but I said you can sit and
[5:31] watch my did I kind of bait her I said
[5:33] now hey you said watch Florida football
[5:36] on television right yeah I said what I
[5:38] said you sat down watch them for three
[5:39] hours a football game is three hours
[5:42] long you sit there and watch that ball
[5:44] game but you can't set two hours and
[5:46] listening to somebody talk about a man
[5:48] that hung on a cross for at least two
[5:51] and a half to three hours with nails in
[5:53] his hand I was I was probably pretty ill
[5:56] when I got when I left I plot of
[5:58] brotherly kindness wasn't flowing that
[5:59] day so that was really it with the lady
[6:01] I mean her religion tells her she if
[6:03] it's two hours long then it's wrong
[6:05] please people good grief I mean that man
[6:10] died God died on the cross for two and a
[6:12] half hours at least from 3 o'clock to 6
[6:14] o'clock head nail prints in his hands
[6:18] they strapped him to his guts was almost
[6:20] hanging out they couldn't brother Browne
[6:21] said the hamburger meats what do you
[6:23] look like but we can't set two hours in
[6:25] the service come on people I mean that's
[6:28] but that's what they're doing out there
[6:30] they're feeding them entertainment and
[6:32] now they won't even entertain them for
[6:33] two hours so they're gonna find them
[6:36] another place I said well maybe you'll
[6:37] find a place that serves your coffee and
[6:39] you can set to in less than 15 minutes
[6:40] and go the house I said but I don't know
[6:44] what you gonna get you know during that
[6:46] time some anyway it was just it was a
[6:50] little I didn't like for her to keep on
[6:54] and on about that cuz you know what two
[6:57] hours is not a long time and then I told
[6:59] her I said let me tell you something
[7:00] you know you spoke to tithe and boy when
[7:02] you talk to them people about tithing
[7:04] they're like their eyes roll back in
[7:05] their head I said look if you just tied
[7:08] your time 10% of your time of a week is
[7:13] not even two hours
[7:15] I mean it's longer than two hours but if
[7:17] you just give in two hours you know even
[7:18] giving him 10% of your time I said think
[7:20] about that lady I said you supposed to
[7:22] tithe 10% I said give me 10% of your
[7:24] time you've got 90 percent of their time
[7:28] to do whatever in the world you want to
[7:30] do give him 10% so anyway I don't write
[7:34] alone and all but but that's what
[7:36] they're getting fed out there I mean god
[7:38] bless him I I hate it for him that the
[7:40] band brother branham did he said to
[7:41] pulpits become so weak and that's what
[7:43] they do they get in the pulpit and you
[7:45] know what I think that church was had a
[7:47] to our side or to our service wasn't a
[7:50] message Church but it was some kind of
[7:52] Center Point Church in Gainesville or
[7:53] something something like that but anyway
[7:55] thank God they have it to our service so
[7:58] that's okay with me
[7:59] well okay well her because she kept on
[8:01] and on about it so anyway let's go to
[8:04] Dingle 924 and we'll maybe we'll try not
[8:08] to be here two hours by way of

[9:36] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that
[9:37] you have given us a desire in our heart
[9:40] to come and sit lord of whatever time we
[9:43] know that many many years ago there was
[9:47] no air conditioned no heat that came in

[9:56] preacher talk about the Word of God Lord
[9:58] don't let us get so far away from that
[10:00] Lord do we forget that you did truly as
[10:03] a human being you hung on the cross till
[10:07] almost 6 o'clock in the afternoon they
[10:08] put you on that tree and every time your

[10:20] thank you Lord that we don't have to
[10:22] climb up on a cross somewhere Lord what
[10:24] you told us to bear cross and that's

[10:28] up on the cross because you did that
[10:29] once for all and lord I pray that we'll
[10:32] give you that time that we'll give you
[10:34] that time Lord that that we'll remember
[10:36] if we become weary and our eyes become
[10:39] dim and our and our mind becomes foggy

[11:39] Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are determined
[11:42] upon thy people and upon the holy city
[11:44] to do six things to finish the
[11:46] transgression to make an end of sins to
[11:48] make reconciliation for iniquity to
[11:51] bring in everlasting righteousness seal
[11:52] up the vision and prophecy into and
[11:54] North the most holy now that's all of
[11:56] Daniel seventy weeks all right verse 25
[11:59] 26 and 27 is gonna tell you how it's
[12:01] done know therefore and understand that
[12:03] from the going forth of the commandment
[12:05] to restore him build Jerusalem unto
[12:06] Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks
[12:09] and threescore in two weeks
[12:11] the street shall be built again and the
[12:13] wall even in troublous times and after
[12:16] threescore and two weeks shall Messiah
[12:18] be cut off but not for himself no we
[12:20] were talking about that with the wild
[12:22] olive branch you and I had to be grafted
[12:24] in he was cut off but not for himself
[12:27] and the people of the prince that shall
[12:29] come shall destroy the city in the
[12:31] sanctuary in the end thereof shall be
[12:33] with the flood and to the end of the war
[12:35] desolations are determined and here
[12:37] we're coming up to where we're going to
[12:39] talk about a little more tonight the six
[12:41] fold purpose part five and he shall
[12:43] confirm the covenant with many for one
[12:46] week and one week equals what seven
[12:49] years and in the midst of the week he
[12:52] shall cause the sacrifice and the
[12:53] oblation to cease for the overspreading
[12:56] of abominations he shall make it
[12:58] desolate even until the consummation and
[13:00] that determined shall be poured out upon
[13:02] the desolate you may be seated in the
[13:05] Lord at his blessing so the reason in
[13:07] the word we'll just bring the brandy
[13:09] chart back out thank you be and I know
[13:18] maybe you can't see that in the back but
[13:20] they'll zoom in on if you want to look
[13:22] at it online it's getting a little worn
[13:25] because we're touching this in many
[13:26] times but but that one week equals seven
[13:30] years and what we're looking at now is
[13:32] the six fold purpose the six fold
[13:34] purpose is six things that happens in
[13:38] this last week to bring in
[13:42] the millennium is that all right say
[13:45] ma'am what we're going to do tonight is
[13:46] is we're going to talk about this little
[13:48] part called Armageddon because I believe
[13:50] if you'll see that - you'll see also
[13:53] that there has to be one week left after
[13:57] the rapture to fulfill all these things
[14:00] to get it everything into that
[14:02] seven-year period
[14:04] it can't be three and a half years this
[14:06] thing keeps there we go there has to be
[14:11] one year week left or seven years after
[14:14] the rapture of the church which is 1260
[14:16] days we'll talk about the two prophets
[14:17] and then after the Battle of Armageddon
[14:20] there's got to be some time there and
[14:21] we're gonna read that again - maybe but
[14:24] let's get into this in second Chronicles
[14:26] let's just read this is the history part
[14:30] here in second chronicles we read it
[14:32] we've read it every time but I want you
[14:33] to know that in second chronicles it
[14:36] tells you that what's going to happen
[14:38] therefore he brought upon them the king
[14:40] of the Chaldees who slew their young men
[14:42] with the sword in the house of the
[14:43] sanctuary and had no compassion upon
[14:46] young men of our maiden old man or him
[14:48] that stood for age he gave them all into
[14:50] his hand
[14:51] remember God said I'm going to disperse
[14:53] you because you won't do what I've told
[14:54] you and all the vessels of the house of
[14:56] God because we're talking about the Jews
[14:58] and we're talking about the city there
[15:01] was a temple Solomon's Temple was the
[15:04] glory of the age then in Jerusalem that
[15:07] was the time that that everything was no
[15:11] there was no war everything was fine
[15:13] Solomon had he just married everybody
[15:15] the king's daughter and he just married
[15:18] ever of all the king's daughters and
[15:19] they couldn't go to war with him because
[15:21] it had to be going to war with their own
[15:22] family so he had a thousand wives so
[15:25] somewhere in there had to be some Kings
[15:26] daughters okay so but there was there
[15:28] was a time of wonderful Oh everything
[15:31] was a had gold all over it and silver
[15:34] and and you couldn't even count the gold
[15:35] the Bible said you couldn't even you
[15:37] didn't even know what was what it was
[15:38] worth and then now what's going to
[15:41] happen though between the time of
[15:42] Solomon at the time of all this is going
[15:44] to happen Israel is going to go and play
[15:47] a prostitute we've already read that in
[15:50] the Bible they're going to go out and
[15:52] have other lovers not physical
[15:55] but spiritual they're going to go after
[15:57] other gods they're going to go to may
[15:58] Locke and all those different ones will
[16:00] they throw their kids in the fire and
[16:02] all these things and God told them said
[16:04] stop it
[16:05] through all the prophets stop and stop
[16:07] and stop it they never would stop
[16:08] so he said okay if you won't stop I'll
[16:10] stop you if you won't let your land rest
[16:13] I'm gonna let the land rest I'm gonna
[16:15] let man tear your temple down but I'm
[16:17] gonna build it back up and all the
[16:19] vessels of the house of God great and
[16:21] small in the treasures of the house of
[16:22] the Lord and the treasures of the king
[16:24] and of his princes all these he brought
[16:26] to babylon so whatever was in jerusalem
[16:29] during that time is gone they just went
[16:32] in and ransacked the whole place and
[16:34] it's just exactly what the same thing
[16:37] titus did cuz they built it all by
[16:39] gutting and titus knocked it down again
[16:40] but we'll get to that later on into the
[16:42] 70 weeks of Daniel and they burnt the
[16:44] house of God and break down the wall of
[16:46] Jerusalem and burn all the palaces there
[16:48] with fire and destroyed all the goodly
[16:49] vessels their own and them that had
[16:52] escaped from the sword carried huee to
[16:53] battle and so in other words whatever
[16:55] didn't die he carried them to Babylon so
[16:57] he dispersed them took them out of their
[16:59] land now remember God will not deal with
[17:02] Israel unless they're in their homeland
[17:04] so he's not going to deal with Israel he
[17:08] never dealt with Israel from the time
[17:10] that that Jesus hung on the cross to the
[17:13] seven churches because right here is the
[17:15] only place he's gonna start dealing back
[17:16] with him right here he's not dealing
[17:19] with him now sure that's going to be
[17:21] saved but that'll be bribed I'm talking
[17:23] about this group of 144,000 that's
[17:25] promised to be raised back up and a city
[17:29] to be built all right and then they had
[17:33] escaped from the stored forgot the water
[17:40] I have to do like Bob we got to have a
[17:42] care for a pacifier
[17:44] y'all ever watch Bob here that he'll go
[17:47] here reaching in here pretty buddy
[17:49] you preach around here put it back never
[17:53] does drink I'll do better let water well
[18:00] they were servants to him and his sons
[18:01] until the reign of the king of Persia
[18:03] because we're going to catch up here in
[18:05] just a few minutes that when we go to
[18:08] this will be later on but when we come
[18:11] into Nehemiah and all those different
[18:13] ones that king of Persia are Cyrus the
[18:17] different once Cyrus is the one that
[18:19] gives them the opportunity to go back
[18:20] and build Jerusalem because nobody wants
[18:22] to place bill back so we'll get into
[18:24] that so fulfilled the word of the Lord
[18:26] by the mouth of jeremiah until the land
[18:27] had enjoyed her Sabbath for as long as
[18:30] she laid desolate she kept Sabbath to
[18:33] fulfil 70 years threescore in ten years
[18:37] they break not that say man alright so
[18:40] now let's go to quote number one we've
[18:41] read this before but we're gonna keep
[18:43] reading it because repetition helps cuz
[18:48] in the six full purpose property God
[18:50] says seventy weeks are determined upon
[18:51] thy people for what purpose for what
[18:53] whose people was it determined to pump
[18:56] Daniels people the Jew so remember
[18:59] remember and remember again the Daniel
[19:02] seventy weeks is talking about two
[19:03] groups Daniels people the Jews and the
[19:09] holy city
[19:10] now that's Bible all right cuz watch
[19:15] Daniels people at you and what was it
[19:17] determined for upon not only Daniel but
[19:20] upon Daniels holy city now class watch
[19:23] Daniels holy city and everybody replies
[19:26] Jerusalem all right so that's the same
[19:28] way with you that's why I'm saying if
[19:30] you if you'll catch this 6-volt purpose
[19:32] you'll see that according to the Bible
[19:34] there has to be one week left after the
[19:37] rapture are seven full years after the
[19:39] rapture because you got a Battle of
[19:41] Armageddon how can you build a temple
[19:43] over here and then you get it destroyed
[19:46] again and then we go into the millennium
[19:48] know can't you can't place it
[19:50] it's just you said well I got close I
[19:53] got the
[19:54] if that quote don't match the Bible is
[19:57] wrong but they're not they're not wrong

[20:47] Millennium with Christ to go into the
[20:52] Millennium is that right say Amen that's
[20:54] what that says and these seventy weeks
[20:56] of Daniel covers from the going up of
[20:57] the church until the coming back of the
[20:59] church that space is what it covers now
[21:01] watch what he says
[21:01] now not all seventy weeks of Daniel part
[21:04] of it
[21:04] remember we got to build dates and times
[21:07] and all this and messiahs got to be cut
[21:09] off and all that but a six fold purpose
[21:11] is only going to happen right here to
[21:14] finish end and reconcile to bring in
[21:16] everlasting rice and sell vision profit
[21:18] in North emotionally that happens right
[21:20] here but it's all set up over here they
[21:24] have to be dispersed they've been
[21:25] dispersed they have to be dispersed they
[21:26] got to come back they got to build the
[21:28] city they got to build the wall even in
[21:30] troublous times they got to gather back
[21:32] into Jerusalem but what did they do they
[21:34] gathered back in Jerusalem and then the
[21:36] Messiah shows up and they turn him down
[21:38] that's where it says he'll be cut off
[21:40] but not for himself he didn't die for
[21:43] herself he died for me in you but he
[21:46] died for the Jews when they said let his
[21:48] blood be on us in our children that cut
[21:50] that olive tree off he cut those limbs
[21:53] off grafted in the wild olive branch for
[21:56] seven church ages then we're going to
[21:58] take a rapture and then in this time
[22:00] right here that's what I was what we'll
[22:02] get into in just a minute a lot happens
[22:06] in here brother Brian
[22:07] MZ cometh the woman in the Sun the red
[22:09] dragon the vials of plagues the trumpets
[22:14] everything happens right here remember
[22:16] all trumpets sound under the sixth seal
[22:18] who opens the sixth seal to profits okay
[22:22] right then you've got the trumpets the
[22:25] trumpets what then the seventh trumpet
[22:26] is is a watch the kingdom of Sovereign
[22:29] Lord has been coming to Kingdom Zahra
[22:31] Christ and we shall rule and reign so
[22:32] it's over here it's a lot in that it's
[22:38] gonna happen in that last week and we'll
[22:42] set it all up here in just a minute
[22:44] seventy weeks are determined now there
[22:47] was a six fold purpose to his visit
[22:49] telling him what was going to come to
[22:51] pass there was a six fold purpose of his
[22:54] coming
[22:55] let's going down to the very end the
[22:56] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[22:58] people now remember that is all that the
[23:00] journey of the Israelites will have in
[23:02] this earth they are determined seventy
[23:05] weeks is just determined that's all
[23:06] lauded to the Jews so you and I don't
[23:09] have a time but they have a time it's
[23:11] going to be 1260 days for them to get
[23:13] Redemption that's what's left you and
[23:17] I've had 2,000 years plus or minus
[23:20] because remember revelations 10 says he
[23:23] still don't one for all and one for them
[23:24] since that time shall be no longer but
[23:28] in Daniel it says the same man stood on
[23:31] land and on sea and raised his hands
[23:33] that will be for a time times and a
[23:36] dividing of times so three and a half
[23:38] years they've only got 1260 days them
[23:41] two prophets know when they get a
[23:42] revelation who they are
[23:44] after 1260 days they're gonna die and
[23:48] they know that but you know that doesn't
[23:50] bother them one bit that doesn't bother
[23:53] one back go they keep on right to the
[23:55] very end all right
[23:58] therefore this 70 weeks and I don't miss
[24:00] it it will reveal from that time to the
[24:03] end of the Jews and what's the end of
[24:05] the Jews the end of the 144,000 is right
[24:08] here because remember the Battle of
[24:10] Armageddon there is going to be no
[24:11] Christians on earth amen there's only
[24:16] good there's no Holy Ghost on this whole
[24:18] earth during the Battle of Armageddon
[24:19] zero
[24:21] two witnesses have gone 144,000 are gone
[24:23] we're already in glory now the now the
[24:29] had a senior moment
[24:31] the foolish virgin they're gonna have to
[24:34] give their life they're not bribed there
[24:36] are nine hundred forty-four thousand
[24:37] they got to go through this they got a
[24:40] they got to go through this and die cup
[24:42] of water in my name all those different
[24:43] ones because remember when all this
[24:45] culminates and the 144,000 comes back
[24:49] builds the temple fifth sealed you
[24:51] wherever they're at I don't know I kind
[24:54] of do but I'm not gonna say anything
[24:54] about it but you and I are right here
[24:58] and that's all that's going to be on the
[24:59] earth that we know of
[25:02] that's in the Bible is us 144,000 that
[25:06] sealed you there's not gonna be a
[25:09] foolish virgin running around it's what
[25:10] I'm trying to say it's not going to be a
[25:11] cup of water in my name there's not
[25:13] gonna be any salvation that I know of in
[25:15] this thousand years why everybody cuz
[25:20] everybody's got a dial they can't go up
[25:22] you can't have people in here they're
[25:25] not that go through a millennium they're
[25:27] not saved I don't know it's hard to
[25:29] start to see these things they're for
[25:32] the nth now don't miss it it will reveal
[25:33] from that time to the end of the Jews
[25:35] now look and also the end of Jerusalem
[25:39] until there'll be a new city built end
[25:42] of Jerusalem remember Battle of
[25:44] Armageddon we're going to read it in a
[25:45] minute it's an atomic battle they're
[25:47] going to lay waste to this whole world
[25:49] who's they
[25:51] humans communism Romanism fascism all
[25:56] that brother Brown said collects into
[25:58] that battle in that valley of megiddo
[26:00] for the Battle of Armageddon
[26:02] all right everybody got that say Amen
[26:04] all right so that's what we're heading
[26:07] toward the Battle of Armageddon where
[26:09] everything's wiped off so brother Brown
[26:13] places it the end of Jerusalem Jerusalem
[26:15] is going to be destroyed right here
[26:17] because they're gonna build in a
[26:18] Millennial temple somewhere in here
[26:20] according to Ezekiel 42 44 and then we
[26:24] ride back into the Millennium as the
[26:26] anointing to the temple I mean I'm
[26:27] reading paraphrasing quotes but I read
[26:30] you the quotes last Sunday where brother
[26:32] Branham said that's what it was was us
[26:34] riding back into
[26:35] millennium with Christ according to
[26:37] revelations 1921 to reside in that
[26:40] temple alright everybody got that choice
[26:45] to the end of Jerusalem until there'll
[26:47] be a new city built now how can you
[26:49] build a new city right here if everybody
[26:51] in the message says no there's only
[26:52] three and a half years left after the
[26:53] rapture to finish Daniel seventy weeks
[26:55] that it's not true according to the
[26:58] Bible how can you bring in everlasting
[27:01] righteousness and and do all that over
[27:04] here and then have a battle of
[27:05] Armageddon and you got to build it again
[27:07] I don't understand that but people
[27:11] listen quotes will kill you Jesus stood
[27:15] and said eat my flesh and drink my blood
[27:17] he never explained it one bit we saw
[27:19] where Paul explained at Sunday those of
[27:21] you that were here to take communion
[27:22] we'd fulfill that scripture amen
[27:27] but did we eat his flesh and drink it
[27:30] nope
[27:30] that's a quote brother well you had to
[27:35] get a revelation of the quote right I
[27:38] hope you get it real deep tonight okay
[27:40] all right let's go to revelations 11:1
[27:42] and there was given me a reed like unto
[27:45] a rod and the angel stood saying rise
[27:47] and measure the temple of God and the
[27:49] altar and them that worship therein but
[27:52] the court which is without the temple
[27:53] leave out and measure it not where he's
[27:56] given unto the Gentiles and the Holy
[27:57] City shall they tread under foot forty
[27:59] and two months
[28:00] how long is forty two months three and
[28:03] one-half years
[28:04] so what's he talkin about right here all
[28:09] right everybody got that same in I'm
[28:11] grating Bible and I will give power unto
[28:14] my two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[28:16] exactly 42 months 1260 days according to
[28:21] the Jewish calendar Oregon I'm sorry the
[28:25] prophetic calendar of 360 days but
[28:29] that's what they got right there
[28:30] everybody got that now what's gonna
[28:33] happen is is the Jews or the 144,000
[28:38] let's say Dutch Jews the 144,000 are
[28:40] going to go through justification
[28:42] sanctification in the baptism of the
[28:43] Holy Ghost just like you did to receive
[28:47] the new birth
[28:47] in their soul to make them 144,000 and
[28:52] to Christians but not like I said Sunday
[28:58] now not statue of a perfect man not
[29:01] adoption you can kind of argue a little
[29:05] bit because I don't think the two
[29:06] prophets were the only ones that's going
[29:08] to stand in and and you know be able to
[29:11] speak the word I believe maybe 144,000
[29:14] may be able to help them a little bit
[29:15] because you know what it's not just one
[29:17] person speaking the word here today it's
[29:19] a many membered body speaking the word
[29:21] all over the all over the world but
[29:23] they're not going to be bribed so
[29:26] they're not required to be up the statue
[29:28] of a perfect man but they are required
[29:30] to realize because it's a revelation to
[29:34] you you can walk around all day like
[29:36] that guys the other day I was telling
[29:37] you about that said he had done it this
[29:40] stuff in in his life and he was fixing
[29:42] to go to court and he went and he's
[29:44] going to go to court and tell him that
[29:45] brother Branham said the real me didn't
[29:47] do it
[29:48] what an idiot I told that brother that
[29:53] told me that I said he needed to get
[29:55] born again because he was using that
[29:56] justification for a crutch he didn't he
[30:00] if you had a true revelation of
[30:01] justification it makes you right down
[30:03] here he don't make you right up here
[30:05] amen it makes you realize and you know
[30:09] you did it
[30:10] because you did it but you realize that
[30:13] God can't see it anymore lopped it off
[30:17] well that's what he's doing right here
[30:18] to finish the transgression make an end
[30:20] of sin and reconcile their iniquity just
[30:23] 144,000 they realize we're not going to
[30:28] go over it much but look they're going
[30:31] to be justified God's going to forgive
[30:34] them of their sins what is that finish
[30:37] the transgression end of sins they know
[30:43] what happened to you listen if you have
[30:45] sinned in your soul today you're not
[30:47] born again it's gonna make an end of sin
[30:54] in their soul
[30:56] and then they're going to be reconciled
[30:58] just like you and I received like we
[31:00] read in Corinthians the Ministry of
[31:02] reconciliation
[31:03] what is the Ministry of reconciliation
[31:05] them two prophets they're going to
[31:07] preach Christ so real until they're
[31:11] gonna say where'd you get those scars
[31:13] they're gonna all realize that that they
[31:15] missed it that Jesus Christ was the
[31:17] Messiah and they totally missed it but
[31:27] that's the same thing this earth is
[31:28] going to go through to when they come to
[31:30] the white throne judgment you know what
[31:32] the people who don't receive eternal
[31:33] life God's gonna say I give you an
[31:35] opportunity you turned me down I could
[31:38] have finished your transgression I could
[31:41] have ended your sin and I could have
[31:43] reconciled you back to me but you
[31:45] wouldn't listen that's why the foolish
[31:47] virgin walks up they get eternal life
[31:48] because they did realize somewhere in
[31:51] their life God was cleaning them up but
[31:55] they never went all the way as brother
[31:58] brown says they never accept it they
[32:00] never got to the new part KND w like
[32:05] Adam knew his wife Eve an intimate
[32:06] relationship they never had an intimate
[32:08] relationship with God but they were
[32:12] sanctified but they never went on to be
[32:18] reconciled to God but now what's going
[32:21] to happen with these four hundred forty
[32:23] four thousand listen God promised he'd
[32:25] save them there's going to be a hundred
[32:28] and forty-four thousand that's going to
[32:31] be saved sanctified filled with the Holy
[32:34] Ghost by two prophets preaching the Word
[32:36] of God and what a powerful message
[32:38] because not just preaching it in the
[32:41] congregation they're going to be
[32:43] preaching it to the world but now the
[32:44] only people going to get it because
[32:45] what's going to happen is the Bible says
[32:47] that if somebody come against them to
[32:53] kill them they would in the same way be
[32:55] killed in other words they come to kill
[32:56] them with whatever a gun or whatever it
[32:58] was
[32:58] the Bible says fire would proceed out of
[33:00] their mouth and in other words they have
[33:03] power to do things but you know what
[33:07] it's getting ready to end the world
[33:09] though
[33:09] they need that powerful message you and
[33:12] I are having a powerful message you and
[33:14] I need to realize that you and I are
[33:16] going to be in speaking terms with God
[33:17] before this right here happens hey man
[33:20] you're gonna be able to call things I
[33:24] believe that if you don't believe that
[33:26] you need to go to the Baptist Church or
[33:29] somewhere else where they just tell you
[33:30] that God died for you stirred well not
[33:32] God but the second God died for your
[33:34] sins 2,000 years ago
[33:36] that's not an intimate relationship but
[33:39] they will have an intimate relationship
[33:40] right here nobody in the world will
[33:43] receive it that's why when they're gone
[33:46] we read it in just a minute what happens
[33:50] because remember there's two battles
[33:52] everybody got that same man there's two
[33:54] battles there's a Battle of Armageddon
[33:56] and there's a battle of Gog and Magog
[33:58] which is way over here after the
[34:00] thousand years two totally separate
[34:02] battles we'll get into it in a minute
[34:04] they asked him that question two totally
[34:07] separate battles one at one end of the
[34:08] thousand years one at the other this one
[34:11] is man is going to do it
[34:12] this one over here God is going to do it
[34:14] because God is going to destroy codes
[34:17] remember look right here battle of
[34:18] Armageddon
[34:18] those people die and they stay in
[34:20] whatever 5th dimension all the way
[34:23] through the thousand years amen right
[34:26] fifth dimension is where the center did
[34:28] go there's a lot of people and pile up
[34:29] in that place during that thousand years
[34:31] and even Satan's bound but he's not
[34:34] destroyed but now the Battle of Gog and
[34:37] Magog over here that's when they're
[34:40] going to be destroyed everything's going
[34:43] to be destroyed over here by God's fire
[34:45] which is the holy fire this will be
[34:49] man's fire a reader where brother Brown
[34:51] says it will be an atomic battle that's
[34:54] why it's gonna take a while so that's
[34:55] why there's still time there's still
[34:58] time in here for this battle of
[35:01] Armageddon not gonna be everybody's dead
[35:04] no there's gonna be people survive why
[35:08] do you think Louise Mad Max yeah
[35:17] everybody saying it the mole movies Mad
[35:19] Max the people that made it through the
[35:21] apocalypse you know and they're all kind
[35:23] of hideous people huh come on you know
[35:26] what that's man's mind trying to feel
[35:29] what God said in the word because
[35:31] remember we're not gonna read it tonight
[35:33] but remember it's the Battle of
[35:35] Armageddon after the draft of the Battle
[35:37] of Armageddon in the Bible it tells you
[35:39] that man would stand on his feet and his
[35:41] skin would fall off of his body and the
[35:43] birds and all would eat his skin while
[35:45] he was alive but what do you think that
[35:47] is that's an atomic battle what happens
[35:49] radiation you they say you just peel the
[35:52] skin off of you if you look at them
[35:54] people in Chernobyl yeah look at that
[35:57] look up Chernobyl in Russia you'll see
[36:01] where they just their meat just falls
[36:03] off their skin well you know what that
[36:05] was under still the grace of God this
[36:08] right here is no grace it's just man
[36:11] pushing buttons let thank God we're
[36:15] gonna be out of here way before that but
[36:18] they're gonna be out of here right at
[36:20] the end of that or right at the
[36:21] beginning of that and then man's gonna
[36:23] just destroy their self let's go to the
[36:25] next one here where we talk about the
[36:28] first three finish the transgression
[36:31] make an end of sins and make
[36:33] reconciliation for iniquity that's one
[36:35] two and three of the six fold purpose
[36:38] everybody got that same man that's one
[36:40] two and three finish the transgression
[36:43] make an interest in reconciliation
[36:45] iniquity that's not for a temple
[36:47] you can't reconcile a temple you can't
[36:50] reconcile a building you can't end the
[36:52] building sins you can't in buildings
[36:55] don't transgress people do so there is
[37:01] Daniels people but now what about the
[37:05] city you got to get Daniel and the holy
[37:08] city if everything is destroyed here
[37:10] there's got to be time for something to
[37:12] be built according to Ezekiel 40 through
[37:17] 44
[37:19] though the children of Israel or the
[37:21] Jews 144,000 they go three processes
[37:24] completes their birth then we've been
[37:27] pointing to the chart
[37:28] I like these words
[37:30] finish and in reconciliation he's going
[37:33] to finish the transgression make an
[37:34] understanding reconciliation for
[37:37] iniquity that's the same way he brought
[37:39] me in you listen if you got sin in your
[37:42] soul tonight you're not born again
[37:45] period now you can have it in your
[37:48] memories and conscience affection
[37:49] imagination that's where Satan plays and
[37:51] that's where God is trying to trying to
[37:52] have preeminence but if you're born
[37:55] again tonight he has preeminence already
[37:57] in your soul because it's him it's not
[38:00] you anymore
[38:01] it's not I've it living but Christ that
[38:05] liveth in me and the life that I now
[38:09] live I live by the faith of a son of God
[38:13] not looking back to the old things that
[38:14] I used to do same way--with same way
[38:18] with 144,000 of what are they gonna do
[38:20] you read the Bible reread it and i
[38:21] condensed it for tonight
[38:23] but they look back and they go where did
[38:25] you get those scars when I didn't get
[38:27] them right here
[38:28] he got them 2,000 years ago at Calvary
[38:31] these two prophets are not going to go
[38:34] over there and let me be real Stern
[38:37] again they're not going to go over there
[38:38] with tape player and quote books they're
[38:43] gonna preach the Bible to them and the
[38:46] Bible is gonna tell them what they did
[38:47] and then the Bible is gonna they don't
[38:50] don't go over there walk over and say my
[38:51] brother Brown said brother I'm said now
[38:53] I promise you they're gonna tell them
[38:55] about us and the Prophet that came in
[38:57] the end time cuz remember see they're
[38:59] looking for a Elijah remember I preached
[39:02] a long time ago the five cups of Elijah
[39:04] they're looking for they know if Elijah
[39:06] shows up the Messiah's going to show up
[39:09] and when John the Baptist showed up
[39:11] guess what the Messiah showed up when
[39:14] brother Branham come and left who showed
[39:16] up the Messiah showed up but now he's in
[39:19] a mini membered form called the bride
[39:21] but they're going to see that understand
[39:24] that and go we missed that part but one
[39:26] of these two prophets is going to do
[39:27] they're going to say oh but wait this
[39:33] man over here died for your sins this
[39:36] man over here in the New Testament told
[39:39] you this is the New Testament in my
[39:41] blood that I've shed for you
[39:44] this man was hanging on a cross and will
[39:46] tell you in the Bible that this man said
[39:48] Father forgive them for they know not
[39:52] what they do they're gonna realize that
[39:55] then they said the Bible says they're
[39:56] gonna separate and they're gonna mourn
[39:57] and they're gonna wail because why just
[40:00] like you did when you got down on your
[40:02] knees and that's God to forgive you your
[40:03] sins you look back to Calvary and you
[40:08] heard him say Father forgive them for
[40:11] they know not what they do
[40:13] oh this thing gets more alive as you go
[40:17] through it it's gotta be alive the menu
[40:22] first where the whole we're the kingpin
[40:24] that's keeping that from happening the
[40:30] headstones gotta come to get the bride
[40:33] cuz this just not the bride but we got
[40:36] to get out of the way so God can deal
[40:38] with those Jews because you won't deal
[40:40] with us in them at the same time we'll
[40:44] be in glory in a marriage supper while
[40:50] all this is going on the bride's gonna
[40:52] be in the palace and then Jesus is gonna
[40:57] slip down into two prophets and he's
[41:00] gonna reveal all they're gonna say just
[41:02] like they did Joseph all we've seen it
[41:04] there's no oh no Joseph said no wait
[41:08] this all happened to save you remember
[41:11] there was seven years of good seven
[41:13] years of bad and now what did what did
[41:16] y'all do he brought his people in
[41:17] Benjamin he brought him in to save them
[41:22] especially that little Benjamin group
[41:24] which is the top of the 144,000 that all
[41:28] right we're in the Bible okay so now
[41:31] let's read revelations 11 again let's
[41:35] put this together just for a second
[41:39] should be done by 8:30 and that was
[41:42] getting me a reed like him to a rod and
[41:43] the angel stood saying rise and measure
[41:45] the temple of God and the altar and them
[41:47] that worship them but the court which is
[41:51] without the temple leave out and measure
[41:52] it not for just giving it to the
[41:54] Gentiles and the Holy City shall they
[41:55] tread under foot forty and two months
[41:57] and now
[41:58] give power to my two witnesses they
[42:00] shall prophesy a thousand two hundred
[42:01] and threescore days twelve hundred and
[42:03] sixty days in sackcloth then I closed
[42:07] inside cloth all right these are the two
[42:09] olive trees and the two candlesticks
[42:11] standing before the god of the earth and
[42:13] if any man shall hurt them fire
[42:15] proceedeth out of their mouth and
[42:17] devoureth their enemies and if any man
[42:19] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[42:21] killed these have power to shut heaven
[42:24] that it rain not in the days of the
[42:26] prophecy and have power over waters to
[42:28] turn them to blood and to smite the
[42:30] earth not just Jerusalem not just Israel
[42:33] proper the whole world is going to hate
[42:36] these people and to smite the earth with
[42:38] all plagues as often as they will now
[42:42] when's that gonna happen that's gonna
[42:44] happen right here right the 1260 day
[42:48] prophecy the two prophets are on the
[42:50] earth doing what they're told to do
[42:53] according to the Bible and that's what
[42:57] they do they have power to shut up to
[42:58] heaven but now let's not read verse
[43:00] seven yet because verse seven says when
[43:02] they have finished the Beast is going to
[43:05] kill them so let's go to Daniel 9:27 and
[43:07] read right here keep it in the Bible and
[43:10] he I remember who is that he that he
[43:14] cannot be Christ or God or anything to
[43:17] do with Christianity because whoever
[43:19] that he is that person is going to break
[43:21] that covenant and God never breaks a
[43:25] covenant and he who the Antichrist shall
[43:29] confirm the covenant with many in other
[43:31] words he's going to gather them together
[43:32] and see okay you can have all your stuff
[43:34] that all right cuz you know about 80 70
[43:38] Titus hauled it all the to the Vatican
[43:40] so down under the Vatican they got
[43:42] everything to put the temple back
[43:43] together
[43:44] the Jews know that no they're not stupid
[43:47] they know that so they're gonna make a
[43:50] covenant and bring them together for
[43:54] seven years and in the midst of the week
[43:56] are 1260 days that's kind of the middle
[44:00] he shall cause the sacrifice and
[44:02] oblation to cease and for the
[44:05] overspreading of abominations he shall
[44:07] make it desolate now how is he going to
[44:09] make it desolate
[44:11] hee hee the Antichrist is gonna walk
[44:13] into that temple that for three and a
[44:16] half years they've tried to make
[44:17] sacrifices to get to my side there he's
[44:20] gonna walk in and go I'm going worship
[44:24] Me
[44:25] amen that's what he says the Beast and
[44:29] you we the United States of America not
[44:32] us personal but in the United States of
[44:34] America's don't give me power according
[44:37] to Revelation 13 give him power to speak
[44:40] but he's gonna make it desolate why when
[44:42] he walks into that temple a Gentile
[44:45] walks into the temple he's going to
[44:47] desecrate the temple so the Jews are
[44:49] going to be one highly agitated group of
[44:51] people but not 144,000 because they're
[44:53] gonna be standing there going I don't
[44:55] care who walks in this building God's
[44:58] right here
[44:59] he's not standing over there God's right
[45:02] here that's why that's why you look at
[45:04] the Bible and you see the different
[45:05] meanings of the Bible in Matthew 24 when
[45:08] jesus walks up and he gives him all the
[45:10] seals and then he's telling about what
[45:11] the olive tree and all these different
[45:13] things he said if somebody says Christ
[45:16] is here
[45:17] he said don't believe Christ is over
[45:20] there don't believe him
[45:21] what don't you the Pope's gonna know
[45:25] he's gonna think he's God because he's
[45:28] Satan and Cleaves the Incarnate Beast
[45:31] and you know what he'll have some signs
[45:34] he's not gonna walk in there not have
[45:37] nothing no he's gonna walk in there
[45:39] fully loaded and start doing signs and
[45:42] wonders just like them to prophets
[45:44] because there's always two twins there's
[45:46] always twins and every anything you
[45:49] bring in there's always God in the devil
[45:51] but who's gonna prevail now look at
[45:54] right here according to the Bible he
[45:57] prevails for just a little while he the
[46:00] Antichrist because what remember let's
[46:04] continue verse 7 and when they shall
[46:07] have finished their testimony the Beast
[46:10] that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit
[46:12] will make war against them and shall
[46:14] overcome them and kill them so he's
[46:17] going to break that 7-year covenant in
[46:19] the midst of the week after this 1260
[46:22] days because remember he can't touch
[46:24] them too
[46:25] which during that time the Bible says
[46:27] they're going to prophesy 1260 days so
[46:30] they're protected just like we're
[46:34] protected if you'll realize that you
[46:41] won't die that you're protected that
[46:44] you've got an anointing on you different
[46:46] from everybody else they got an
[46:48] anointing on them that they will not die
[46:50] for 1260 days
[46:52] I don't care thanks in the Mossad FBI
[46:54] the CIA the AAA or whatever you want to
[46:58] send over there 1260 days bullets cannot
[47:02] harm them poison cannot harm them guess
[47:06] what when we come to close that body
[47:08] change guess what that's what's gonna
[47:10] happen to us amen brother Brad said they
[47:15] have to crawl up your sleeve when you
[47:16] just brush it right off how many of you
[47:19] have brushed death off today if you got
[47:23] up you did if you got up and walked in
[47:29] this church and you're breathing you
[47:31] destroyed death for a while anyway cuz a
[47:33] some people didn't make it through today
[47:34] some people didn't make it to the day
[47:37] but you did so you just thank God for
[47:40] that
[47:40] and when he had finished their testimony
[47:42] the Beast that ascendeth out of the
[47:43] bottomless pit shall make war against
[47:45] them and shall overcome them and kill
[47:47] them and their dead bodies shall lie in
[47:49] the street of the great city which
[47:50] spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt
[47:52] also where Lord was crucified so where's
[47:55] that at Jerusalem all right and they
[47:58] have the people and kindred and tongue
[47:59] and nations shall see their dead bodies
[48:01] three days and a half and shall not
[48:04] suffer their dead bodies to be put in
[48:05] the grave like I said before CNN Fox
[48:10] News NBC CBS ABC Clinton News Network I
[48:15] always said that CNN some got that some
[48:21] didn't
[48:23] yeah but anyway they're gonna be
[48:25] watching they're gonna be look that
[48:27] those people have tormented the whole
[48:28] world now they're dead and they're gonna
[48:31] send gifts to the each other you know
[48:33] what that is that's an old pagan ritual
[48:36] in Rome when they would remember the
[48:38] leaves and all the things that the
[48:39] Romans would wear it's cuz they
[48:41] conquered somebody and they started
[48:42] sending gifts to different ones well
[48:44] that's exactly what's going to happen
[48:45] because what Rome is going to be ruling
[48:49] and they have the people in kindred
[48:51] tongue nations shall see their dead
[48:52] bodies three days and a half see so
[48:54] they'll see it on television or internet
[48:56] whatever and shall not suffer their dead
[48:58] bodies to be putting the grave so anyway
[48:59] these cameras are on these dead guys for
[49:02] three and a half days and in Israel it's
[49:05] really hot all the time so three and a
[49:07] half days they're not gonna look so good
[49:09] because remember Lazarus was dead for
[49:13] days and Mary said what he's thinking so
[49:16] just you understand I'm going to make
[49:19] this as graphic as I can because they're
[49:21] gonna have cameras on these two guys
[49:22] these guys taught me to the whole world
[49:25] they love to see them dead look and they
[49:29] that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice
[49:30] over them and make merry and send gifts
[49:34] one to another because these two
[49:35] prophets tormented them that dwelt on
[49:38] the earth and after three days and a
[49:40] half you know what the people of Earth
[49:43] and the gunner they're gonna think that
[49:45] they prevail and that that little thing
[49:48] they just went through was just nothing
[49:50] but you know like just a little just a
[49:52] little bump in the road Oh buddy way do
[49:55] you li get right here you a little
[49:58] battle Armageddon starts they don't even
[49:59] realize none of that yeah and after
[50:02] three days and a half the spirit of life
[50:04] from God entered into them and they
[50:05] stood upon their feet and great fear
[50:07] fell upon them which saw them and they
[50:10] heard a great voice from heaven saying
[50:12] unto them come up hither and they
[50:14] ascended up to heaven in a cloud and
[50:16] their enemies beheld them now many times
[50:19] you have to be careful with that because
[50:21] 144,000 is gonna have to be killed too
[50:24] so they're all going to take a rapture
[50:26] because they're gonna be right there
[50:30] with them two prophets like I said
[50:31] they're only gonna hate two prophets
[50:32] they will hate all them honey the Jews
[50:34] are gonna hate the 144,000
[50:38] you always get persecuted more from
[50:40] within right the inner circle
[50:44] Judas Esau yeah and you know who tried
[50:50] to kill Hitler his inner circle tried to
[50:52] kill him first so that's the same way
[50:54] with that they're gonna they're gonna
[50:57] all be killed and going to rapture now
[50:59] when they go in the rapture what's gonna
[51:00] happen oh hey it's gonna break loose but
[51:04] now look let's go back just for a second
[51:08] this where I was looking at today if
[51:10] you're looking your Bibles you don't
[51:12] have to look in it now but look at
[51:14] brother Brown stares from revelations
[51:16] for one to revelations 19 the bride seen
[51:19] no more right we go in the rapture for
[51:22] one is what John is caught up through an
[51:25] open door he's caught up brother Brown
[51:28] said that's when the bride goes in the
[51:29] rapture
[51:29] now remember revelations 5 is a scene in
[51:32] heaven a scene revelation 6 now remember
[51:36] the seals open to the Jews because there
[51:43] stands your 60o right there the sixth
[51:46] seal that's not open while we're here in
[51:50] this natural form
[51:51] because these two prophets of the sixth
[51:53] seal we just went through that that
[51:54] ought to be kind of fresh in your mind
[51:55] these two prophets are that sixth seal
[51:58] they are the trumpets all trumpets sound
[52:00] under the six seals of the trumpets so
[52:02] read your Bible look revelation 6 the
[52:05] seals are breaking on earth
[52:06] revelations 7 look at revelation 7
[52:09] revelation 7 is and after these things I
[52:13] saw four angels standing on the four
[52:14] corners in other words all these things
[52:16] watch verse 4 and I heard the number of
[52:19] them which were sealed and they were
[52:20] sealed 144,000 there's revelation 7
[52:25] revelations 8 same thing look at
[52:28] revelations 11 revelations 11 swear you
[52:31] two prophets come down
[52:32] revelations 12 watch this revelations 12
[52:35] is the woman in the Sun the manchild
[52:41] being born and all these different
[52:43] things look at the Archangel chapter 13
[52:48] what the beef to all
[52:49] is happening right here right here
[52:54] now watch revelations let's go to
[52:57] revelations 14 I'm just speeding through
[52:59] here revelations 14 I looked and lo a
[53:02] lamb stood on the mountains island with
[53:04] him 144,000 that's not us that's them
[53:10] having his father's name written in
[53:12] their foreheads and heard a voice from
[53:15] heaven as the voice of many waters and
[53:16] as the voice of a great Thunder I heard
[53:18] the voice of harpers harping with their
[53:19] hearts and they sang as it were a new
[53:22] song when we can't sing because we sing
[53:26] a bride's own they sing a 144,000 Jews
[53:30] song and they sang as it were a new song
[53:34] before the throne and before the four
[53:36] beasts and the elders and no man could
[53:38] learn that song but the 144,000 which
[53:41] were redeemed from the earth
[53:42] these are which not defiled with women
[53:45] they're virgins there when they which
[53:46] follow the lamb horse whoever he goeth
[53:48] they are redeemed from among men all
[53:50] right there that's chapter 14 now go
[53:53] over to chapter 15 chapter 15 now where
[53:56] does the vials get poured out right here
[53:59] where does the plagues get poured out
[54:02] right here I mean that all right that's
[54:06] that's chapter 16 all right you got the
[54:09] vials on chapter 16 then chapter 17
[54:12] you've got the seven tombs you've got
[54:13] babbling coming in now watch chapter 17
[54:16] chapter 17 shows you right where it's
[54:20] going to end up at right here Rome's
[54:25] gonna rule for just a moment when that
[54:28] 1260 days is over Rome is gonna rule for
[54:31] just a moment but it's only gonna be for
[54:33] just a moment therefore shall her
[54:37] plagues come one day death mourning
[54:39] famine she shall utterly burn with fire
[54:41] for strong as the Lord God who judgeth
[54:43] her then it talks about babbling again
[54:48] didn't you go to what revelations 19 so
[54:55] from revelations 4:1 to revelations
[54:58] nineteen goes on right here amen
[55:02] I just read the Bible it goes on right
[55:06] here not right here
[55:08] it's all these other things because you
[55:10] got the battle Armageddon in there you
[55:12] got to I didn't read it all but you got
[55:13] the you got the demons that come out
[55:16] with a long hair and all those different
[55:18] scorpions and all that stuff that's
[55:19] happening all through here battle of
[55:21] armageddon man standing can't die calls
[55:23] for the for the rocks to fall on him and
[55:25] they can't die their skin falls off the
[55:28] birds eat your skin while they're still
[55:29] alive that's right in here but now
[55:32] revelations 19 you don't see any of that
[55:34] all you see is one I read it last Sunday
[55:36] you see the bride coming down to what
[55:40] settle on a earth that's been cleaned
[55:43] off by this battle of Armageddon but
[55:47] during this but during the Battle of
[55:48] Armageddon when everything's being taken
[55:50] care of when that Bible is over God's
[55:54] gonna finish his six fold purpose he's
[55:58] not gonna finish it down here he can't
[56:00] how you gonna bring in everlasting
[56:01] righteousness and take that hideous
[56:03] stuff I just told you and put it right
[56:04] there can't do it you can't seal up the
[56:10] vision and prophecy into people you
[56:12] can't anoint the most holy down here
[56:14] that's us coming into the temple
[56:15] there's not even a temple here now there
[56:17] might be a physical one that man built
[56:19] that the that the Antichrist is going to
[56:24] step into
[56:25] but that ain't God's temple this is eco
[56:28] 42 44 is the dimensions that God told
[56:30] them to be if you'll read it read
[56:32] Ezekiel 43 44 look at the things that
[56:35] happen through the eastern gate and all
[56:36] these different things that are going on
[56:38] they're going to rebuild that temple
[56:40] because it's to Daniel people and the
[56:44] cities got to be built back for
[56:48] millennium to start everybody got that
[56:52] same man I hope you do man because if
[56:54] you don't when we start reading some of
[56:56] these quotes and things and we start
[56:57] getting through danger seven new weeks
[56:59] you gonna say we're just faced final
[57:01] resting place where does it lie in I
[57:05] read you two quotes last night last
[57:07] Sunday face final resting place two
[57:09] prophets it is in the Bible is in the
[57:12] Word of God you take everything back to
[57:14] the Word of God and it will
[57:16] work itself out I promise you it will
[57:18] our profit was not wrong folks I did I'm
[57:21] like brother Dale out stand right here
[57:23] find me some work now listen he said
[57:26] well he said now if he said he was wrong
[57:27] that's different he did stand up one day
[57:31] and said I preached a white horse rider
[57:32] was the holy goat I was totally wrong he
[57:37] said I thought the 144,000 was the bride
[57:40] I thought the fifth cell Jill was the
[57:44] bride that's what he said
[57:46] he said it was way past my but I want
[57:48] you to bring me one quote where he said
[57:50] I was wrong in damn 70 weeks he was not
[57:56] he was not wrong he said it right the
[57:59] first time second time and third time
[58:00] and every time but why do people fall
[58:07] off the message wagon and that's the
[58:09] first thing they bring up Daniel 70
[58:12] weeks brother Brennan was so wrong in
[58:14] Daniel 70 weeks and Feast of the
[58:16] trumpets he made so many mistakes
[58:17] bla bla bla bla bla that's all I hear is
[58:19] blah blah blah blah but they won't
[58:22] listen to somebody don't put them
[58:23] together and put it with the Bible and
[58:25] the message if you put it with the Bible
[58:27] take the Bible first you don't take the
[58:30] prophets message and make the Bible fit
[58:31] in no God don't share his glory with
[58:35] nobody but if you can take that Bible
[58:39] I'll guarantee you the prophets message
[58:42] will fit right in that Bible every time
[58:46] alright let's look at the Battle of
[58:48] Armageddon just for a second right here
[58:49] real quick Daniel 12 verse 1 in it at
[58:53] that time shall Michael stand up the
[58:55] Great Prince which standeth for the
[58:57] children of thy people whose died people
[58:59] Israel Jews there shall be a time of
[59:02] trouble such as never was since there
[59:03] was a nation even to that same time and
[59:06] at that time thy people shall be
[59:08] delivered who the 144,000 are going to
[59:11] be delivered every one that shall be
[59:17] found written in the book now let's go
[59:20] to the 70th week of Daniel Oh 806 1961
[59:28] I didn't highlight any of these because
[59:30] I want to read through kind of slow we
[59:31] got about 15 minutes all watch these
[59:33] three prophets now he it corrects itself
[59:36] or these two prophets when they raise up
[59:39] here and in the middle of the week
[59:42] they're cut off like that now where is
[59:44] the middle of the week I just read you
[59:48] after 1260 days they're gonna die and
[59:54] then starts the Battle of Armageddon not
[59:57] here right here if I got that either
[1:00:01] shake your hand they're saying man well
[1:00:02] I'm shaky as a man okay I'm just I'm
[1:00:06] reading it's got to fit the Bible that
[1:00:09] quotes got to fit the Bible and watch
[1:00:13] and in the middle of the week they're
[1:00:15] cut off like that and then starts the
[1:00:18] Battle of Armageddon then God begins to
[1:00:20] speak himself then he stands and begins
[1:00:23] to fight that prophets are striking the
[1:00:26] earth what the stick sale they're
[1:00:28] preaching the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:29] they're baptized in the same way they're
[1:00:31] doing the same thing that the first
[1:00:33] Pentecostal fathers did and many are
[1:00:35] following them but that who's
[1:00:37] Confederated that organization moved
[1:00:40] right on down and even the power of
[1:00:42] those two prophets didn't break it
[1:00:43] that's what struck me today when I read
[1:00:45] that quote that power of that Federation
[1:00:50] denomination whatever you want to call
[1:00:52] it the Pope that power is so great that
[1:00:55] kills them two prophets it's stronger
[1:00:58] than they are watch even the power of
[1:01:00] those prophets didn't break it because
[1:01:02] I'm telling you just like this that one
[1:01:04] heat when when the Antichrist or the
[1:01:06] Pope walks in right here and walks in
[1:01:08] that temple and says I'm your God a lot
[1:01:12] of people believe him because there's
[1:01:14] going to be two forces fighting each
[1:01:16] other you've got to have to to have a
[1:01:19] battle two opposing forces even the
[1:01:24] power of those prophets didn't break it
[1:01:25] and finally they said we'll make it all
[1:01:28] one organization and he brings in what
[1:01:31] is it the abomination Romanism I just
[1:01:33] told you brings it in right here
[1:01:34] Romanism to overspread the whole thing
[1:01:37] that makes desolation battle Armageddon
[1:01:40] is going
[1:01:41] daesil ate the whole world the
[1:01:44] abomination that maketh desolation takes
[1:01:46] in everything the filthiness now let's
[1:01:50] read number two questions and answers
[1:01:51] and this is 1953 look how the
[1:01:55] abomination of Daniel when the Great
[1:01:57] Prince shall come he'll prophesy a
[1:01:59] thousand two hundred and threescore days
[1:02:00] which was three years and six months and
[1:02:03] that's exactly what Jesus preached so
[1:02:06] he's taking the three and a half years
[1:02:07] in Jesus priests he comes to the Jews
[1:02:10] alone that where is that right here
[1:02:12] he didn't come he come to the Jews but
[1:02:14] they reject him cut him off remember
[1:02:16] right here so watch what he's saying
[1:02:19] he'll cut him off for a sacrifice of the
[1:02:22] people and that abomination maketh
[1:02:24] desolation the Muhammadans set up the
[1:02:26] mausoleum of omar there which is over
[1:02:28] there now and they would tread down the
[1:02:30] walls of Jerusalem - until what the
[1:02:33] Gentile nation beat this dispensation be
[1:02:37] fulfilled was that he went - right here
[1:02:41] alright then watch what he says and then
[1:02:45] he will return to the Jews again and
[1:02:49] there's when the Battle of Armageddon
[1:02:51] takes there he called the Gentiles to
[1:02:54] take the people out for his name his
[1:02:55] bride he study goes back to right here
[1:02:57] cuz remember he don't take a bride out
[1:02:59] here we're gone so he's God takes that
[1:03:03] right here you got to learn to place it
[1:03:09] yes sir the 144,000 are all redeemed
[1:03:13] Jews just got to stand there yet which
[1:03:15] is in here alright so now let's go to
[1:03:18] questions and answers 1954 read seeing
[1:03:21] all these things they're putting out the
[1:03:23] materials out there the Jews real rich
[1:03:25] then that same thing will pollute their
[1:03:27] camp again yeah they'll come right down
[1:03:30] the cities of the world Russia will come
[1:03:31] down we just got to have that stuff
[1:03:33] that's uranium and everything down there
[1:03:35] we got to go get it and as they go down
[1:03:37] then we'll be the Bible of Armageddon
[1:03:40] that'll be when God will stand like he
[1:03:43] did in the valley of the children of
[1:03:44] Israel and fight again but that'll take
[1:03:46] that in other words that will not take
[1:03:48] place until the Gentile dispensation
[1:03:51] will be finished and when that time is
[1:03:53] finished she's cut off cuz remember
[1:03:55] there's no Gentile saved after right
[1:03:56] here no Gentile zero we're gone Gentile
[1:04:01] Brides out of here he goes to the Jews
[1:04:03] 144,000 alright so let's go to the next
[1:04:08] quote now this next quote the house if
[1:04:12] you'll remember if you've read your
[1:04:13] Daniel 70 weeks book brother Brown tells
[1:04:16] you he's leaving that night to drive the
[1:04:19] Tifton Georgia to preach this message
[1:04:20] right here so this was preached two days
[1:04:23] after brother Branham preached the 70th
[1:04:25] week of Daniel on 8:6 he drives all the
[1:04:30] way to Tifton Georgia to preach this
[1:04:33] message but that way he says now the
[1:04:36] Bible predicts then in the last days
[1:04:38] he'll he will trap policies and Romanism
[1:04:41] and all those things and then coming ISM
[1:04:42] on all them together they're in the
[1:04:44] valley of Megiddo there till there be
[1:04:47] such a slaughter amongst them until the
[1:04:48] blood will flow to the horse's bit
[1:04:51] horse's bridle see that's in Revelation
[1:04:53] that'll be in but thanks be to the
[1:04:55] Heavenly Father I don't think we'll be
[1:04:58] there by his grace we won't we'll be in
[1:05:02] glory then look see that will be right
[1:05:05] after the the two prophets has
[1:05:07] prophesied in the Battle of Armageddon
[1:05:09] that's when these Gentile nations get so
[1:05:12] wicked just keeps on Confederations
[1:05:14] churches and all this comes together God
[1:05:17] will take the church the electorate's
[1:05:18] home out of everyone and all the
[1:05:20] sleeping virgins will be waiting the
[1:05:22] Lords of sleeping virgin will still be
[1:05:24] here now the bridles bit they're come
[1:05:26] out from the sleeping burdens and all
[1:05:27] them back in that day and he talks about

[1:07:47] rumors of wars and V days and V days and
[1:07:49] V days it'll all finally wind up in the
[1:07:52] great battle of Armageddon that'll be
[1:07:54] the last of it when she comes to the
[1:07:56] Battle of Armageddon that will settle
[1:07:58] the whole thing just before the great
[1:08:01] millennium armageddon is to clean off
[1:08:04] the earth shiri purifies herself with
[1:08:07] this atomic blowing atomic and the
[1:08:15] volcanic ash and things sink this soak
[1:08:17] blood of men and upon the earth and sin
[1:08:19] and crime
[1:08:20] she sinks beneath the earth and the
[1:08:22] volcanic Bray's out again and renews and
[1:08:24] cleans the earth for the great
[1:08:26] millennium he cleans his church during
[1:08:28] that time for people to live here a man
[1:08:30] I like that yes sir
[1:08:31] there's coming a time when it would be
[1:08:34] great everybody got that same in all
[1:08:38] right here's the last one this one is
[1:08:39] where brother Brown puts a lot together
[1:08:41] we're going to read it anyway
[1:08:42] number seven questions and answers 1964
[1:08:46] the church age ending and has blacked
[1:08:49] out the bride is called and we have
[1:08:50] already entered into the Tribulation
[1:08:52] Period now there's people still believe
[1:08:54] that they believe people believe we're
[1:08:55] in the Millennium you know how I tell it
[1:08:59] you know how I tell them take them to
[1:09:00] the zoo because the lines posted lay
[1:09:04] down with the lamb take them to the zoo
[1:09:06] and throw them over in the Lion pit
[1:09:08] we'll see if we're in the Millennium or
[1:09:09] not actually they will see further in
[1:09:12] the millennium or not but how foolish
[1:09:17] somebody taught that and this person
[1:09:19] right here asked the question he thinks
[1:09:21] we're already entered in the Tribulation
[1:09:23] Period that's a question this is
[1:09:25] question number 392 and questions and
[1:09:27] answers somebody asked that question
[1:09:29] brother Brown said no no no you're I
[1:09:32] wish that I could have more time on that
[1:09:33] see the bride when she's taken from the
[1:09:35] church then the church age will cease
[1:09:38] right here right
[1:09:40] Laodicea goes into chaos what the the
[1:09:44] foolish version and all the ones that
[1:09:46] don't have to die during this part of
[1:09:48] the tribulation the bride goes to glory
[1:09:52] and the Tribulation Period sets in upon
[1:09:54] the sleeping virgin for three and a half
[1:09:56] years while Israel is getting its
[1:09:58] prophecy then tribulation sets upon
[1:10:03] Israel and then comes about that's that
[1:10:07] little part right in here then comes the
[1:10:09] Battle of Armageddon which destroys all
[1:10:12] things and then the bride returns back
[1:10:16] with a groom right here what revelations
[1:10:18] 19 for a thousand years the millennial
[1:10:21] reign then he finishes up after that
[1:10:24] comes the white throne after that comes
[1:10:26] new heaven and new earth and a new city
[1:10:27] coming down from heaven God out of
[1:10:29] heaven eternity in time blends together
[1:10:33] but we haven't finished we got to bring
[1:10:35] in everlasting righteousness sillas
[1:10:37] vision profiting on photo ain't done it
[1:10:39] yet bring it up you got three more to
[1:10:44] finish up we didn't finish him over here
[1:10:49] this right here's gets us into the
[1:10:52] Millennium because listen folks you
[1:10:55] whatever you think about we don't build
[1:10:57] temples we're the bride but according to
[1:11:01] Ezekiel 42 44 there's got to be a
[1:11:03] millennial temple built our brother
[1:11:06] Graham says instructed he means put
[1:11:09] together instructed somewhere in here
[1:11:13] for us to ride back to go walk into it
[1:11:16] not sit there watching build it amen
[1:11:23] so how can that happen right here
[1:11:25] according to what everybody in the
[1:11:26] message says it's only three and a half
[1:11:27] yet years to finish Daniel seventy weeks
[1:11:29] they can't be according to the Bible
[1:11:31] there's seven years 1260 over here you
[1:11:35] got the Battle of Armageddon how can you
[1:11:37] bring in everlasting righteousness and
[1:11:38] then have a battle of Armageddon I just
[1:11:41] read you what happened in the Battle of
[1:11:42] Armageddon everything is destroyed man
[1:11:45] destroys their self and everything else
[1:11:48] and then when all that dies off there's
[1:11:51] 144,000 somewhere got to come back in
[1:11:54] here and start building the temple to
[1:11:57] bring in everlasting righteousness seal
[1:11:59] up the vision and prophecy where is it
[1:12:01] sealed up you say well it's sealed in me
[1:12:02] sure the Gentile part but they're
[1:12:05] sealing up parts then 144,000 that
[1:12:08] vision is sealed up of Ezekiel 43 44 I
[1:12:11] don't think they're gonna have to come
[1:12:13] back and go all right find me a Bible no
[1:12:18] they're gonna come back and no because
[1:12:20] they're Jews they study this thing don't
[1:12:23] you think they study that Old Testament
[1:12:25] they know it better than you know the
[1:12:27] New Testament so they know all the
[1:12:30] dimensions and they're going to come
[1:12:31] back and even the Bible says they'll
[1:12:34] build houses they'll build houses and
[1:12:39] they'll then have it ain't got time to
[1:12:42] get into that cuz we're about doing they
[1:12:45] will have vineyards
[1:12:46] and someone else won't take over you
[1:12:49] know what they're saying
[1:12:51] brother Dale's daddy built a house and
[1:12:54] then he died and one day he had to give
[1:12:56] it to him and then one day then
[1:12:58] generation no Bible says they'll build a
[1:13:00] house and they'll in heaven they'll
[1:13:02] plant vineyards and you'll get the
[1:13:04] vineyard it's not passed on down you got
[1:13:06] it they'll build their own thing but you
[1:13:08] and I
[1:13:09] according to Ezekiel 42 44 you and I are
[1:13:13] going to be the anointing to that temple
[1:13:15] according to what I read you last Sunday
[1:13:16] is the anointing to the temple will be
[1:13:20] the bridegroom and the bride and the
[1:13:25] 144,000 is going to be there he's going
[1:13:30] to be the son of David
[1:13:33] sitting on a throne ruling the twelve
[1:13:35] tribes of Israel he's not ruling over us
[1:13:40] he's our husband we're on a honeymoon
[1:13:44] we're not going to be toiling and and
[1:13:49] all these things we're just gonna be
[1:13:52] there but they got a lot to do you know
[1:13:55] why they got a lot to do because they
[1:13:57] turn crops down over here but now
[1:14:00] remember before we close right here
[1:14:02] remember one thing don't look down on
[1:14:04] these guys because their daddy literally
[1:14:08] walked over there at Calvary I put his
[1:14:11] hand over their eyes and he said I'll
[1:14:14] deal with you after a while but I got to
[1:14:16] get me a Gentile bride cuz they're gonna
[1:14:20] they're gonna fall in love with me and
[1:14:23] I'm gonna marry them but I'm not gonna
[1:14:25] forget you now I'm the one that blinded
[1:14:27] you NIF God willfully blind somebody he
[1:14:29] can't kill him that's what remember the
[1:14:32] fifth seal Jew was the same way he
[1:14:34] literally blinded him well he literally
[1:14:35] blinded him for 2,000 years he blinded
[1:14:38] them but when we leave the hands lift it
[1:14:42] off but only 144,000 are gonna see it
[1:14:46] and then when all that's over in the
[1:14:48] Battle of Armageddon then folks we bring
[1:14:51] in everlasting righteousness why they
[1:14:53] come back here to the earth like brother
[1:14:55] mom said right here
[1:14:59] the Battle of Armageddon which destroys
[1:15:02] all things everything is destroyed but
[1:15:07] now remember that thousand years is of
[1:15:09] is still in time we're still in time
[1:15:12] here let's read something real quick I
[1:15:13] didn't I read it last Sunday let's read
[1:15:15] again this Sunday let's go to Daniel
[1:15:19] they don't have it on there but they can
[1:15:21] pull it up if they want to if you keep
[1:15:24] reading in Daniel says go that way
[1:15:25] Daniel chapter 12 verse 9 go that way
[1:15:28] Daniel for the words are closed up and
[1:15:29] sealed till the time of the end meaning
[1:15:32] she'll be purified and made white and
[1:15:33] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[1:15:34] and none of the wicked shall understand
[1:15:36] but the wise but the wise shall
[1:15:43] understand ok verse 11 and from the time
[1:15:51] that the daily sacrifice shall be taken
[1:15:54] away and the abomination that maketh
[1:15:57] desolate set up when is that I just told
[1:16:01] you
[1:16:04] incarnate Satan comes in the Beast
[1:16:06] we're Pope whatever you want come he
[1:16:08] walks in and desecrates the temple they
[1:16:11] can do no more sacrifices that's what
[1:16:13] makes them mad they that whole temple
[1:16:17] that they built took them all this time
[1:16:19] to build it one man walks in and just
[1:16:21] desecrates the whole temple and from the
[1:16:24] time that the daily sacrifice shall be
[1:16:26] taken away and the abomination of watch
[1:16:29] that make it desolate set up there shall
[1:16:33] be a thousand two hundred ninety days
[1:16:39] that's only 1260 1290 puts you on out
[1:16:44] here but we're not done with that
[1:16:51] blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to
[1:16:55] the 1330 fifth day that's going on over
[1:17:01] here a little bit father we're over in
[1:17:04] the Millennium now blessed is he that
[1:17:07] makes it to that who's gonna make it
[1:17:11] 144,000 they're gonna make it cuz they
[1:17:15] got to come back here to build that
[1:17:17] temple but for you and I it doesn't
[1:17:19] matter if we come back right here right
[1:17:21] here right here but we definitely coming
[1:17:23] back right here according to what the
[1:17:25] Bible says we can walk right into the
[1:17:28] Battle of Armageddon and stand there and
[1:17:30] watch the whole thing be obliterated and
[1:17:31] it's not gonna bother you you in a
[1:17:33] glorified body so what does it matter
[1:17:37] and that's one of the main questions
[1:17:39] we'll close right here musicians come
[1:17:41] everybody says well well brother Ram
[1:17:43] says we're in the wedding supper for
[1:17:45] three and a half years and what are we
[1:17:48] gonna do during this time of face three
[1:17:49] and a half years left you made a bad
[1:17:52] point you said time I thought time is no
[1:17:57] longer for us right here so what does it
[1:18:00] matter and I want you to show me in the
[1:18:02] Bible
[1:18:02] we're worried a wedding supper for three
[1:18:04] and a half years there is no scripture
[1:18:07] that says we're at a wedding supper for
[1:18:10] three and a half years nowhere in the
[1:18:12] Bible nowhere but think we got to thank
[1:18:16] God we had a prophet that connected that
[1:18:19] with that because remember we're in the
[1:18:24] palace but then Joseph comes back down
[1:18:26] here to reveal itself to them it does
[1:18:30] not matter you what does it matter what
[1:18:33] we're doing we're in eternity with the
[1:18:38] wedding supper he's gonna be going on
[1:18:42] while God reveals itself to the Jews and
[1:18:45] when he finishes revealing himself to
[1:18:47] the Jews they're going somewhere
[1:18:49] brotherly because they're not gonna go
[1:18:51] through this battle of Armageddon God's
[1:18:53] gonna take them out of here take them in
[1:18:55] a rapture just like I said and then them
[1:18:58] 144,000 they've got to come back
[1:19:00] somewhere in here and build that temple
[1:19:02] back
[1:19:04] that's Bible let's stand our feet
[1:19:07] that's the Bible and that's your whole
[1:19:10] six fold purpose so Daniel seven two
[1:19:12] weeks cannot end right here it has the
[1:19:15] end right in here because there's one
[1:19:18] week left why do you think brother Bram
[1:19:23] preached he didn't preach the 70 weeks
[1:19:26] of Daniel on that third sermon he
[1:19:27] preached the 70th week not the half week
[1:19:35] you said better I got a quote it's got a
[1:19:38] match the Bible but don't match the
[1:19:40] Bible you got to go back read it again
[1:19:42] if you don't see Christ in every verse
[1:19:44] go back and read it again but it's God
[1:19:47] revealing himself but also hiding
[1:19:50] himself in total simplicity let's sing a
[1:19:54] song
[1:19:54] god bless your heart and for faith to
[1:20:04] increases yes sir
[1:20:07] [Music]

[1:21:27] thank you lord
[1:21:31] you know there's many things that we go
[1:21:32] through in life but just like that
[1:21:36] 144,000 there's a lot they're gonna have
[1:21:38] to go through but going through it it's
[1:21:42] part of it
[1:21:44] for us to come out on the other side and
[1:21:47] be victorious
[1:22:16] that's the connection that prayer cloth
[1:22:19] is your connection to God don't have to
[1:22:22] pray Bible didn't say acts 19 he didn't

[1:28:51] his truck and brother burned him just
[1:28:52] laid over the top of them and prayed and
[1:28:56] he handed us bolts of them and I still

[1:29:55] of our Satan as a prophet of God and I
[1:29:58] see it more every day Satan hates
[1:30:00] revelation he hates it more than
[1:30:02] anything it's for somebody to get a
[1:30:05] revelation from God and that's alright
[1:30:08] that's okay because we live and feed and
[1:30:12] breathe on Revelation we need a
[1:30:15] revelation more than anything the
[1:30:16] prophet of God told us so Lord we need
[1:30:19] for you to reveal yourself to us father
