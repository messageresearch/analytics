life maybe now Cheryl brother wait last night I said I really am thankful to God that I met Jesus before I got indoctrinated with the message amen and I met the Lord Jesus in the power of his resurrection and he taught me who brother Branham was and he told me how important the message was and he began to reveal to me the things out from the spoken word amen I'd like to invite your attention this afternoon in Luke chapter 12 praise God really appreciated that scripture reading this morning that y'all had and I hope the word of the Lord was a blessing to your heart this morning praise God I really do believe we're in a bride age I believe we're in a age of the spiritual womb brother Branham said that the body started from the feet and went up to the head the Pentecostals had the tongues and the Prophet was the seer and brother Branham mentioned the intelligence coming down amen and pick up your pen and write brother Branham said the word or the Holy Spirit said through the prophet the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he what's done with the word so the true bride has the mind of Christ amen gonna read two passages and have a word of Prayer Luke chapter 12 verse 51 and 52 I don't know if you've ever noticed when I'm kind of in Bible numerix numerology a little bit brother Brennan said the Bible mathematics is perfect when you see patterns and themes it's undeniable and the Lord Jesus is perfect they men so you heard brother Graham talking about them keys in that tape services earlier the keys the key of faith amen so uh verse 51 52 supposing that I am come to give peace on earth I tell you nay but rather division verse 52 for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three let's pray blessed father God as we come to this part of the afternoon service Lord we just asked father that your Holy Spirit would come rest O Lord in our hearts in such a mighty and special way Lord Jesus we need to hear your voice we need to receive the perception that is divine a conception God by your Holy Spirit and word and I asked father for each and every individual to be so blessed and so caught up Lord and seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that each and every individual recognize where they're walking that each and every one of us God will be so conscience Lord of what you're saying how you are moving what you want us to do how you want us to fulfill your pleasure in this day God we just not only pray for the Saints here but worldwide your precious bride that's been called out and separated and how your prophet taught us how to rightly divide the word and now today since the seals are open we see a bride out from a church just like you sent your Exodus prophet so many years ago God to bring Israel out of Egypt that nation out of a nation now we see a bride out from the church world Lord and you're getting ready to glorify her and take her off the earth father and we want to be made ready we want to be seeing ourselves in that reality the quickening and the imparting of Christ himself into us through Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask your blessings over the hearing and their speaking of your word today in Jesus Christ our Lord amen amen god bless you can have your seats so this passage is like all the other passages in the Bible it's the truth we made a point today about how the six seals don't really cause a whole lot of controversy among message folks it's always the seventh seal that seems to be the point of contention and if you notice what Jesus is saying here suppose he that I am come and the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord so he says I am come not to bring peace but division so out of all seven sea which seal caused the most division it's the seventh seal because the seventh seal is the mystery of his coming it's the secret of his coming is that right when brother Branham preached the rapture message he took this to Saint John chapter 11 and brother Branham showed us shout and voice right there in chapter 11 that's right so if you can see shout and that's Jesus coming to Mary and Martha that's Jesus Christ uniting with the living and then he went to the tomb of Lazarus and brother Branham taught us the voice of the resurrection spoke and raised Lazarus is that right but Jesus came to Mary and Martha first how many remember the date the cloud appeared in Arizona sky February 28 and in Saint John 11 verse 28 Martha went to Mary and said the master is come and calleth for thee is that right so the master came United with Mary and Martha then called Lazarus from the grave then in chapter 12 you see Jesus sitting at a table feast with the one that was raised from the dead Lazarus and then the one that was living Mary and Martha you got shot voice and Trump that's where brother brown showed us shout watching Trump and Saint John chapter 11 so everything that we're into now has been foreshadowed in the Bible this move of God in the last days the calling out of a bride the bride being taken to the marriage supper of the Lamb it's all right in here in this Bible is that right so it's important when you hear the Prophet speaks something right that spoken word unlocks and opens the mystery in the scripture have to take the Bible it have to take the word of the message back to the Bible is that right so in Luke 12 51 suppose D that I am come to give peace on earth nay but division so we see a lot of division don't we but in spite of all that division we see Christ uniting with an elected bride the one great thing that was brought to my attention in these last last several months where the weight is how that in the Book of Ruth when you open it up the very first verse you the setting in which Ruth the story Ruth has taken place it says in the days of judges write the days of judges is after the days of Joshua and in the days of the judges is when every man did what was right in his own eyes and in spite of all that static and in spite of all that confusion in Israel there was a Gentile bride coming into marriage union with Boaz now I don't know about you that then courage is my heart because the main thing is your marriage union with Christ that's right because there's going to be false ministers there's going to be false believers the true Bride of Christ is always counterfeited there is a false bride and there is a true bride there's a false ministry but there is a true ministry spirit-filled born-again sons of God anointed to speak the word in this hour because in Revelation chapter 10 8 to 11 John represents the bride is that right and the Lord told John the Brides thou must prophesy again but he wasn't fit to prophesy until after he ate the book huh got it take the prophets message back to the Bible to get a real revelation where do you think brother Brown got his message from right out of the Bible and brother being told us when you're sitting in the cool of your room listening to a tape and when you hear something strike turn the tape off and go get the scripture that's a quote you hear a press play all the time there's one brother Brent says turn the tape off and go get the scripture huh got to take the prophets message back to the Bible if your doctrine doesn't line up with written word and spoken word I think you need to get rid of it if you can't take your idea of what you think brother Branham 'san and show it from the Bible from Genesis to Revelation I don't really care for it too much that's right because when you see the prophets message in the Bible you are a blessed person very blessed if you just try to take the message on its own you're doing wrong say brother branham said it I believe it brother BAM told you to dig in that word brother Brown told us basically in different ways to take the message back to the Bible check me check the Bible check me if I'm in the scripture or not is that right so we're very happy in this hour our little church there in Mobile the sweet Lord Jesus has been so faithful to us to guide us we listened to tapes we stayed the prophets message but he allows us to make discoveries in that Bible we have found places in the word that speaking directly to us we have found our identification in the Bible we found our names written in the Lamb's Book of Life we see ourselves in a plan of redemption and this is what bringing faith for translation they men and we like to fellowship around it too we like that we like to talk to ministers we'd like to talk to believers we like to talk to the housewife we like to talk to the mailman amen about these great revelations that God has brought by vindicated prophet and now it's moving in an endtime bride making her ready and prepared for a rapture amen so I want you to notice in verse 52 for from henceforth there shall be five in one house right three against two and two against three I want to share with you something the Lord was dealing me about because I was meditating in some of the things I was noticing about translation the rapture changed in dimensions and I was noticing brother way to number 51 and the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart and told me to look up the first verse in the whole Bible that's verse number 51 so I went from Genesis 1 when all the way and found it in Genesis 24 Genesis chapter 24 is the longest chapter in the whole book of Genesis that's the chapter Abraham sent Eleazar to go call Rebecca for Isaac verse 51 the first verse in the Bible number 51 says behold is before the take her and go and let her be that master sons wife as the Lord has spoken so I want to show you today this principle of how the bride is a separated people the true Bride of Christ and this principle of separation and how it's associated with the number 51 the number 51 is 17 times 3 you notice number 17 is a powerful number in brother branham's ministry and brother brown's life when brother Branham had that hunting accident he was shot in the back of the legs the doctor said your heart's only beaten 17 times a minute when he went to India he had 17 different religions resist in him right which sister hope was on her deathbed she who told brother Brown bought a rifle that she had been secretly hiding money to save up to buy him that rifle that rifle was only 17 dollars right and then when brother Branham was baptized in Ohio River and the pillar fire came down what number of person was he baptizing when the pillar fire came Amen 17th person so in the in the Bible the first time that Elijah's ever mentioned in the whole Bible is first Kings chapter 17 right so in Luke chapter 1 verse 17 it says he shall go before him the spear and power of Elijah speaking of John the Baptist st. James 5:17 says Elijah is a man of like passions as we are so the number 17 being connected with Elijah and Elijah being connected with the rapture first that's the Loni's force 17 but we which are alive and remain shall be caught up is that right so the number 17 is associated with the vindication of a prophet and the fulfillment of prophecy and the rapture the translation of the bride is definitely a fulfillment of prophecy because we are told and we are taught that our bodies are going to be changed into atoms and we're going to go from time into eternity and this great thing has been foreshadowed down through the Bible and I'd like to meditate those things don't you because those are the things that speaking of the endtime bride that's right think about it friends even our precious brother branham has been taken over on the other side he's got to come back in the resurrect and then go back home there's an endtime bride that's been left here that don't go home by way of the grave she goes home and straight to heaven in a body change does that rise in those in the message spoken our souls that are in prison now brother Brent honest people don't have to die to go to hell they're in Hell right now hell's being created on earth what just says it is on that side so is it for the divine side there's people here they'll have to die to go to heaven your souls already translated over there you're seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're living in the age where full Redemption is revealed full redemption is your body change are you in that channel can you see it on folding in your life oh I hope so so the Lord still me about this and I'm seeing man look at all these things in the Bible here because the bride being separated is a big deal isn't that not a big deal to you because in the church ages there was churches churches Brides Brides right and everybody was a Christian everybody in church was praise God hallelujah and then finally when a prophet comes there's a distinction made like whenever Israel was down in Egypt you know you really couldn't see a whole lot there you know there was Hebrews and there was Egyptians and they was just all mixed in there but when Moses came all of a sudden there's a difference being made a separation was coming so one deal with this principle this principle of separation okay because we don't know when the bride's taken off the earth that's a pretty mighty separation when you say when you're changed from more from Mortal to immortal 'ti you're separated how many other precious blood of Jesus separates you from your sins is that right have you been a separated out are you distinct are you distinct are you separated unto Christ now that's an important point because not only are we separated but we got to be separated on to something we're not separated on to a church we're not separated on to a flesh and blood and hand we're not feeding on a man we're feeding on the body word of the we've been separated and our diet is reflecting the fact that were separated people Dayman like the priest could only certain food because he's separated for a work for a purpose so the enzyme bride is a separated people and her diet reflects that Amen so behold Rebekah is before you take her and go and let her be that master son's wife as the Lord has spoken what a message I say the bride is before us let her go let her go be united in the marriage supper Amen let the word unite with the word now is that right so I'm meditating along these lines and I'm thinking look at this here now this passage in 52 from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided when you read the story there in Genesis 24 you find out that Ellie Azar's going to the house of Rebecca and he's in the house explains to them that his master Abraham sent him and brother Branham talks about it you can read it in the word there was Laban but though Rebecca's mother Rebecca and Eleazar that's five right well L is I was there to pull Rebecca out so there's two against three and three against two company lays that come to that house he separated Rebecca from her own house is that right then the message separate people doesn't even the revelation separate Abel from Cain it's something isn't it now when you start letting the Holy Spirit lead you down this path it has enormous its massive the fact that the bride is a separated people what is it that distinguishes her and separates her it's really the revelation of the word right so I got curious now if I see the first 51 in the Bible and that sets a precedent to something what's the last 51 in the Bible I said Lord you got me going here so I looked up the last 51 in the Bible it's 1st Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed so I put that verse with that verse and I'm seeing something amen doesn't brother Brown teach us that all scripture dovetails with Scripture behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed now the part where it says we shall not all sleep that's the end time bride that's the ones that are living this verse 51 is speaking of those that are alive and remain those that are alive and remain is 1st Thessalonians 4:17 right but this verse 51 in the first verse 51 is all connected to the endtime bride being called out separated and taken right you ready to get into it all right I try to go slow because I don't want to preach over it I want you to conceive this is the age of conception amen so this is an awesome thing because the Lord don't never change amen the scripture in Ecclesiastes I like to share with you real fast Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 14 and 15 you are familiar with this I'm sure but he says I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be for ever amen nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God do it that that men should fear before him that which hath been is now there's nothing new Under the Sun that which has been is now and that which is to be has already been has it there when brother Branham preached the rapture message didn't he show us there were already raptures don't they represent the rapture will into now sure they prefigure they foreshadow so friends I'm just trying to get you understand how important it is to meditate dwell in these things watch the word keep your eyes on the word there's a coat where brother Brown says don't keep your eyes on the messenger but keep your eyes on the message watch the word be conscience of what is unfolding through the word there is a message to comprehend there's something to actually conceived by and that is Virtue's coming into you to represent himself in flesh the Lord Jesus is not without a body today he has mortal flesh that he's veiled in and it's a bride amen so it's important you don't allow Church and church politics and debate and fussing and division to really distract you from receive an impartation of Revelation from Christ because when people get their feelings hurt coldness and indifference come young people struggle over what it's all about and there's so much division you know and I got young people I've spoken with you know or just you know I don't want to get into it so much but you know young people get to a certain age they start looking for spouses and they really got to trust the Lord for the right kind of spouse and then some young people amongst us are really looking for spiritual people to marry I mean they really don't want to just married us anybody and it's getting harder and harder to find young people that are really sold out to Jesus because brother Brown taught us that we before we even get married we should really have the Holy Ghost so it's a very very serious issue to make sure that when you're involved with somebody is that something I truly sold out to Christ is there so in fellowship with Christ because there's many people that profess to believe the message now the message has been here for decades and the message has spread around the world and we got all kinds of professors in the message but Bertman said there's professors without a possession so there's a difference between being a message professor than a message possessor that's right your true possession is Christ Jesus that imparts his own life into you not just a doctrine up here but a life in here do you understand that's reality so if you get Christ in here he illuminates the mind to the doctrine but the doctrine is typed by water but revelation is typed by wine and it takes Jesus to turn that water into one it's good to have brother Brown said every Church has doctrine a church without a doctor's like a fish without a backbone but the doctrine has to become wine the water has to become wine your doctrine should be stimulating that's right is that right so I'm going on through here finding all kinds of things and it's really fascinating to see then we'll just go over some scriptures today so you can see some continuity and some interesting aspects of this principle of separation division are dividing okay and I would like for the brothers to bring up on the screen my quote from the Seventh Seal that I was going to share today on this I'm going to try to hit two things at once if you look at this verse right here from the Seventh Seal I want to deal with this again it's you know about numbers but brother Branham mentions it so we're going to deal with it there's been a three-fold purpose in all these things right very very profound got the white horse the red horse and the black horse that's a three-fold purpose but it all mixes together in the fourth horse is that right you got justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and it all goes together to make adoption placed sons and daughters of God you got Abraham Isaac and Jacob is that it no you got Joseph perfection Joseph is a perfect type of adoption being placed right so we're in adoption age right now for the brim said this is the age of adoption but it takes justification sanctification batches and all the dose before you can recognize your true position in Christ is that right so it all goes together a three-fold purpose in what brother and said all these things you're so spirit and body is that right he's the same yesterday today and forever I mean we could just exhaust the point right so that brings us back to a three wasn't brother Browns ministry three pools okay and a seven again oh he had three pools and seven mysteries to teach and preach reveal right that brings us back to a 3 and a 7 again see seven seals seven vowels and so forth now in threes and sevens it's God's number in his mathematics of revealing his word this pause a minute think this is why I appointed to meditating the message I want to go too fast just relax what he said God's mathematics of revealing his word is threes and sevens well check this out Britain sisters in the third month in 1963 brother Branham preached the seals guess what Days started preaching them on March 17th right revelations 10 7 the message is perfect with the Bible that's all I want to demonstrate here today the message must be taken back to the Bible you weave it back and forth even in our precious brother Billy Paul teaches us that's like the front sight and a rear sight of a rival you got to line them up and if you don't line them up you'll never be accurate so don't just give me a quote let's take the message back to the Bible let's see the continuity of the word from Genesis to Revelation amen because that's what real faith is gonna come from it taking the spoken word with the written word all right I think you agree with that oh praise the Lord so let's just look at this now brother branham's giving us a key you just heard it was so perfect when you played that part of the message it's a key this spoken word right here is a key God's mathematics of revealing his word is threes and sevens right March is the third month of the year he preaches the seven seals in March in July 1963 he preaches Christ the mystery of God revealed what does he teach us in that sermon the whole Bible is a three-fold purpose three-fold purpose in the seventh month seven seals in the third month I could just beat you to death with this stuff it's just over and over it's because the message is perfect right so he's preaching the seven seals right by revelation he's bringing us the seven seals right if you look at the format of the sermons there's actually seven seals but he adds three sermons to it God high in simplicity the breach in questions and answers and gods mathematics of revealing his word is threes and sevens right William Marian Branham is three names with seven letters in book revelations chapter three brother Branham is the seventh church age messenger but over in revelations 14 he's the third angel is that right brother Dale so he's connected with the number seven and the number three right so whenever you go and you look at these things and this is just one quote of the Prophet you can spend like a lot of time just digest in that one statement and people think they're just doing so much listen over and over and over again listen one tape after another it's not about how much you listen it's what you're getting out of it when you do just this one statement right God's mathematics of revealing his word is threes and sevens now did you hear brother Branham taught us this Bible is a seventh sealed book and it has a three-fold purpose so when the Seventh Seal is opened brother Branham said the seventh seals a three-fold purpose so when the seventh seal opens it shows you three folds of a mystery that God had in the back part of his mind the reason why that's so good because it's easy for you to understand three one two three seven when you get that so simplified and understood you can study the message in the Bible you can look for those places every time the Bible mentions the number seven watch close most likely it's gonna refer to something like in type the seven church ages like in the message called desperation brother Branham took his text in Jeremiah and he said where Jeremiah the Lord spoke to Jeremiah said you in captivity seventy years but at 70 years end I'll bring you back into this land brother Branham says see back to Pentecost it doesn't say that but that's what I mean to the church brother Branham was using the 70 year captivity to type the seven church ages so when you see that huh that's right so when you see that you find out now what books of the Bible are part of the history after the captivity you start seeing Ezra Nehemiah those are restoration books you people are featured in the book of Ezra and in a book of Nehemiah read Nehemiah chapter eight there you are observing the word in a very distinct way during the Feast of Tabernacles in Nehemiah chapter eight mind you they men that's supposed to mean something to message folk because those are restoration books and we've been a restored people back to the faith is that right so whenever the big deals going on with Ezra Nehemiah what is the big deal they're they bring out the book of registry and they start checking people's names and there was a whole group of people that did not even qualify for the ministry because they couldn't find their names in the book the reason why they couldn't find their names in the book is because of a false Union they married into a family took their name instead of stay with their Hebrew name it could be found in the book that doesn't somebody just send out of heaven in his last days with a book in his hand and he's calling names out of that book that's the important thing is to hear your name call from this book right here it's by faith it's by revelation and it's spiritual you don't hear a loud voice in your ear you hear it from your heart amen so God's mathematics are revealing his word as threes and sevens remember what brother Branham taught us we're there seals are in written form Matthew chapter 24 Matthew chapter 24 brother Branham was showing us the disciples came to Jesus how many questions did they ask three questions how many seals did brother Branham on or did the Lord Jesus unfold in that chapter right that's your a lot of people only see six seals in Matthew 24 you better look a little closer and at the end of the chapter what is going on jesus said to be two in the bed one shall be taken and the other left what did Genesis 24 51 say behold Rebekah's before they take her and go and in Matthew 24 one shall be taken and the other left two will be grinding at the mill one shall be taken and the other left right - two people in the field one shall be taken and the other left and you go down to that very last part of that chapter guess how many verses are in Matthew chapter 24 51 alright notice Matthew chapter 24 is the seven seals one shall be taken and the other left right where did I take you to in Genesis Genesis 20 the bride being taken out the Seventh Seal alright so that is that simple enough for you do you see the continuity of and how the message in the Bible is perfect with one another and when you get into those things you really start saying things more and more unfold I mean it's an eternal word so it just keeps unfolding because God had this in his mind before the foundation of the world he had it placed in the Bible through types and allegory and prophetic continuity of the word so what is such a glorious deal is to see yourself in that pattern and natural real faith is because the Lord Jesus knew what was written of him and brother Branham was definitely sure what was written of him the glorious thing about the Prophet is whenever he told me to he said me too honey I'm going to noon woods and I ain't coming out so the Lord takes this thing away from me so when he goes to his place in his way and he says one o'clock came two o'clock came three o'clock came then the light came in the room and the angel says do not fear I've come from the presence of the Lord to tell you about your on under-under misunderstood life but what did the angel do he referred to brother Branham many places in the Bible they angel open the scripture to brother Branham just like Gabriel open the scripture of the Daniel brother branham even said and he referred to me many other scriptures so when brother Branham saw it in the scripture it changed everything the preachers was telling him oh that's of the devil right he said oh brother McKinney pray for me I don't want to be a devil but when he actually seen it in the word cuz angel said the ministry called it Beelzebub then they do it now because they just didn't understand then brother Branham didn't understand but when the angel King angel visitation opening the word right seven angels coming to brother Branham and the word opens amen that's right so an angel came to brother Branham to show him his life in the word and brother Branham is our angel to the sages show us our lives in the word do you take the message that way do you understand that that's the purpose is for you to become conscious of what's written of you so you can be an overcomer in these last days that's what this is all about to bring about a people who can overcome this Satan's Eden and you and I'm telling you you can't overcome unless you see yourself in this plan of redemption personally personally not groups not others not churches and our people not to prophet you personally do you understand is that preaching that's right that's the way it's supposed to be so Matthew chapter 24 is 51 verses right well when the seals are recorded in symbol form in revelations chapter 6 there are 17 verses in that chapter right 51 verses in Matthew 24 so when you see those people being taken out that's the seventh seal that's the bride going amen so it's really a marvelous thing to see the victory and the achievement of Christ and an endtime bride we know the bride scattered around the world and she's from every nation you'll never really get to see the bride until the resurrection you see churches and you see message folk but there's the bride mixed in with all that that's the truth right the thing of it is brother Brown said it over and over and over again but somehow brother Dale people just don't seem to really get with it he deals with Israel as a nation he deals with Gentiles as individuals so it is your individual responsibility to make your calling and election sure to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling you cannot be a Christian by mere association no way no how no shape or no fashion no mere association you must know Jesus Christ personally that's right because you know that thing is still amongst us so strong in people they like to be identified would this click that click sectarianism is just alive and well in the message something like it never was sectarianism division because people want to be identified with this or they identify with that what about just being identify with Jesus huh what our brother bran tell the denominational people get born again fill the Holy Ghost come to know Jesus Christ then go to any church you want to huh is that right what arts Chris she's supposed to be rugged rugged believers not hot dead plants huh I'm not afraid to fellowship with anybody in this message I sit down eat a ham cheese sandwich with tape only I sit down eat a ham and cheese sandwiches that's right because if you don't know Jesus you don't know much anyway you have to know him personally personal Jesus not the doctrine in your head but the life in your heart is that right just preaching a little bit all right now what form is Christ in today he's in the form of a bride where has the word gone it was veiled in a prophet the one man ministry was was fulfilled and brother Branham that's right there is no other prophet and no other capacity but brother Branham forget it unless you got a scripture then we can start talking but if you don't forget it brother Branham was the last one-man ministry now you're talking about a bride being called out from all the nations otherwise why have we translated his message in all the known tongues and sent around the world but to call an end time people the Lord Jesus said except a corn of wheat dies it abides alone but if it dies it brings forth much fruit so the whole point of the son of man is to spread his life out and multiply right so all that life was veiled behind the Prophet but through the spoken word he's multiplied his life in a multi-member body and in that body there's people anointed that's right oh my there's actually people anointed to understand the message there's people anointed amen to live the message there's people that are anointed of Christ to become written epistles of the prophets message that's right the greatest honor you can ever give the Prophet is livers message out let the message live itself out through you that's right is that the truth praise the Lord so the message in the Bible got to be put together that's how we check preachers out that's how we check churches out that's how we check everything out if you don't spend time with Jesus sitting at the feet of Jesus right whenever he came to Mary Martha's house and Martha was all busy and covered about and Jesus said Martha Martha you are busy and coded about many things but mary has chosen that one thing needful to sit at the feet of Jesus and hear the precious words do you spend time with Jesus amen I'm talking about prayer and reading your word right and I'm talking about the hearing of the recorded sermons of a vindicated prophet I'm talking about the fruitfulness of hearing not the religiosity of hearing but the fruitfulness coming to a revelation of faith through the spoken word there's a difference you know because when the Lord Jesus said destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up most of them thought he was talking about the temple there that heart Herod remodeled but the Bible says he's talking about the temple of his body they heard exactly what he said but they didn't know what he meant so if they did it with Jesus don't you think they do was brother Branham if they heard what Jesus said and then quoted him verbatim and was wrong you know those men quoted Jesus we heard this man say destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up they quote exactly what he said brother Mike but they was wrong as the day is long because they didn't know what he meant be careful jesus told his disciples be careful how you hear is that right pray for a revelation pray for the Holy Ghost is that right so go to me to Joshua chapter 18 Joshua chapter 18 right brother branham said Joshua is the Ephesian we're in the Ephesians again Joshua right Joshua chapter 18 I'm going to read for you in verse 4 I really had a great time when the Lord showed me this because if there was a prophet in these last days and that prophet was commissioned by God to reveal seven mysteries because there's seven seal mysteries sealed the whole Bible so do you believe that was a scriptural thing absolutely what kind of question is that brother Matthew I've been in a medicine 50 years of course it was scriptural I'm trying to make a point if that is scriptural then it would be foreshadowed in the scripture nazara the opening of the word I showed you this we preached this morning about how Adam was a type of Christ right well what happened to Adam he was put to sleep God opened up his side and out came a bride and there was a bride age right there in the Garden of Eden right so when they put Jesus Christ to death on the cross they pierced his side where the mic water and blood Jesus gave forth the elements to give forth birth to an alpha bride and the Alpha bride was there so situated so perfectly under the headship of Christ the Bible said great grace was upon them all is that right do you know what the earmark or the defining characteristic of that early church was Jesus himself leadings of people not a doctrine or idea or counsel people a group of preachers it was Jesus Christ himself the headship over the churches literally Christ on presence that was the Apostolic age right didn't if I would say no man dared joined himself unto them because it was the Lord that added daily to the church such as should be saved but what do we got today any old scallywag can walk through those doors and sit in this pew and say I believe Malachi 4 right because the churches in these last days are the true bride like I said it's scatter around the world to truly let their not together like they was then that was the very beginning of the Alpha bride right so whenever they open the sight of Jesus it gave birth to the Alpha bride so there was a sealed up mystery in Adam and there's a sealed up mystery in Jesus that's what the Bible is a whole canon of Scripture and brother Brennan says when you read a verse description don't see Jesus go back and read it again so what is this book a testament to who's the speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old Testaments Jesus of the new but this was sealed like Adam was sealed Adams worth alone Jesus was sealed Jesus thought alone but when they got tore open outcomes their bride right so in these last days after the seventh church age messenger has given the revelation the seven seals what comes out yeah how Jesus in the form of his bride huh that's right the bride age after the seven charged messenger because it took the opening of the seals to call the elect so now it's not profit profit profit its Christ in the bride Christ in the bride Christ in the bride it's not Abraham's son LasR Abraham sent Eleazar it is Rebekah is in marriage Union with Isaac right the bride doesn't need to be told press play press play God sent a prophet she already knows that one of the biggest problems with people today is they can't retain they can't seem to retain things right you tell somebody something and five minutes later you got to tell it to them again the Holy Spirit helps you retain the word right now talking spiritual brother don't worry about it my wife's got to tell me three times brother sometimes four or five I'm talking about the word you can probably remember the scripture better than you can remember anything some I told you today before amen that word is powerful in the anchors in our souls is that right so I got you in Joshua 18 they turn the screen off on me Oh Lord Joshua 18 four and five give out from among you three men for each tribe and I will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to me and they shall divide it into seven parts right divided what into seven parts the land and then Judah shall abide in their coasts on the south and in the house of Joseph shadow by on their coast in the north okay when you read on down through Joshua 18 Joshua told them to record this land in a book okay describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God now what they did was and what I'm showing you took three men out of seven tribes because there are seven tribes remaining to be placed in the land so Joshua by inspiration costs three men out of those tribes you got your three and seven right because God's mathematics of revealing his word is threes and sevens this is typifying or foreshadowing the whole Bible being revealed because this seven part book is what they brought back to Joshua Joshua stood in the doorway of the temple in Shiloh test Lots and rightly divided the seven part book so the seven remaining tribes can know their place and know their position in the land of inheritance but I want you to show you in Joshua 18 he's using a book to do it and he's using a seven part book and our prophet in these last days took the Bible that we'll see what seven seals and revealed the mystery of the book and open it up so the end time bride can know her place in her position it took the book to do it it took the opening of the book to reveal it is that right so we see our place in God's plan of redemption so I'm just showing you this principle here of God's mathematics of revealing his word you see that threes and sevens now how many remembers how many feasts God ordained for Israel to observe seven Passover right feast of unleavened bread feast the firstfruits then Pentecost and that's all in the summer time and then the last ones like touching on the spring and then you come on over to the seventh month feasts the trumpets feast of atonement then Feast of Tabernacles all right all three of the last feasts are in the seventh month three and seven right so you have this going on and on there's Jehovah Jireh CH over rapha jehova nissi Jovic alone Joe over on Joe over suit canoe G over Shama seven compound redemptive names all pointing to Jesus Christ but those seven Jehovah's are speaking of Lord Jesus Christ right so uh it's really fantastic this that one statement is what I'm trying to share with you because we're the branch says your soul spirit and body and your life is renewed every seven years brother Ram taught us there's seven dimensions but there's three heavens right so brother Bob has been recently ministering on the furniture in the tabernacle there's seven pieces of furniture but there's three courts out of court in her court and holy of Holy's right and brother Branham taught us that Moses set it up that way because it all speaks of Christ the furniture speaks of Christ the tabernacle speaks of Christ everything speaks of Christ what's off situated by three and a seven because God's mathematics of revealing his word it's threes and sevens now bring up Amos the scripture I got there brother Amos chapter three verse seven it's just like you know surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets Amos 3:7 right there so God's mathematics of revealing his word is threes and sevens you can see three and seven all over brother branham's life and ministry three poles seven seals right not that you necessarily need the message to be vindicated to you but it sure is fun sure is fun to already know you're right about what you're right about amen so even the seals were formatted there's ten sermons preaching seven seals right when he preached the church ages he preached ten sermons for seven Church ages so there's three sermons added to the seven churches right in 1960 he preached revelation of Jesus Christ in a Patmos vision that's just like God high in simplicity in the breach then he preached the first church age second third fourth fifth sixth church age and in between the sixth search agents seven church age he preached ten virgins in hundred forty-four thousand that's revelations chapter seven because the ten virgins in the hundred forty four thousand are revelations chapter seven all right so he brother branham even put an interval between his sermons just like it's formatted in in the scripture and here's the seven churches right here right there's ten virgins in the seven churches it's formatted exactly like the seals so it's seven seals which three sermons added to it seven Church ages with three sermons added to it all right threes and sevens Amen eat okay what's the point brother Matthew even the way he preached the sermon the scriptural right even the way they're formatted because even the way the bots the Bible's broke down chapter and verse is inspired people used to argue about it come on brother man even chapter and verse that's why Isaiah 66 chapters represent 66 books of the Bible it's all there for a reason amen I believe it from cover to cover chapter verse every line and brother Brennan said there's more in between the lines and what's on the line and that love affair lets you see what's in between the lines amen so you can just go on and on is this a vindicated message Amen threes and sevens my friends it's really a fantastic reality the seven pieces of furniture the seven feast seven dimensions in three heavens right and the whole Bible just being sealed with seven seals and a three-fold mystery the revelation of Jesus Christ in these last days has been perfectly laid out for an endtime bride so that she can recognize her place in her position in God's plan of redemption all right so bring up for me if you don't mind Joshua chapter 19 verse 51 in this verse right here it's whenever they make an end of dividing the land now just remember Matthew chapter 24 2015 1 versus Genesis chapter 24 verse 51 it's about a bride being taken out one morning brother Dale is waking up and I heard his clear is a bell in my heart when saints awaken there'll be no faking for it's been spoken those with the token will be taken because this is an age where brother Branham says there will just be an absence of people and you know it's not to scare you it should rejoice the heart of a real believer with that man came to brother Branham says brother man you scared the people talking about to come in the Lord brethren said what people not God's people to come into the Lord should be the greatest rejoiceful thing that you can even think about that's right the sweet Lord Jesus coming to catch you away that's how internet you must be with the Lord not like well I want to make some more money or I just want to see my business grow I want to see this I want to see that you want to see that more than you want to see Jesus you got issues that's true this verse is where so they made an end of dividing the country does the word of God rightly divided is the bride divided from the church in these last days this is what I'm trying to share with you how the bride has been separated out the bride has been divided and we've been taught how he must rightly divide the word a workman that needeth not be ashamed is that right rightly dividing the word is understanding the distinction between bride and church because the bride is the living word like Jesus Christ is a living word right rightly dividing the word so they rightly divided the land according to their inheritance so that's the type of what's happening these last days by the opening the seven seals the true Bride of Christ knows her place in knows her position as that right brother Louise so uh Exodus 12 51 and it came to pass the self-same day that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land Israel was separated from Egypt it's just a principle of separation I'm sharing with you now okay now go with me to Luke chapter 9 Luke chapter 9 guess what verse 51 all right and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up and it came to pass when he should be received up right he was parted from our received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem okay now this is an interesting thing right here because when you read on down through the passage they did not actually let him come to that village because he sent messengers before him there was a two sons of thunder John and James and whenever they wouldn't receive him he said Lord you want us to call fire down out of heaven like Elijah did you remember that well I want you to notice in this verse 51 and it came to pass when he should be received up what does that mean let me take in the glory okay he's got to be separated from his disciples okay but he sends them into the city of the Samaritans it was a village of Samaritans but when they found out he was going to go to Jerusalem they said now I never mind we don't want you to come because there are sectarianism between Samaritans and Jews remember that a conversation Jesus had with the woman at the well he said that the that we worship God in this mountain because of our Father Jacob but did you say in Jerusalem is where you ought to worship I think that kind of thing still exists with people today brother Branham taught us the only place God accepts worship is in Christ the only place God will meet you is in Christ what did Jesus tell her you know not what she worshiped but salvation is of the Jews for the father seeks those that worship Him to worship Him in spirit and in truth not in Jerusalem nor in this mountain is that right so the place of worship was an issue with the Samaritans they wouldn't even let Jesus come there because he was on his way to Jerusalem so because of their religiosity they are like now no thanks isn't that strange so James and John said Lord you wants to call fire out of heaven on him and he says no the Son of Man didn't come to take life but to save but I want you to see a correlation now because I'm a Bible reader I see verse 51 when it came time for him to receive up remember when that King fell through the lattice and he was sending two men to go inquire of a false god Bale elisha met him on the road says what you're doing is there not a God in Israel and he sent them back and him back in the blue they went back and told the king and the king said what'd he look like and they described what Elijah look like and the King perceived that it was Elijah so Elijah sent a captain with his fifty everybody how many that is that king sent fifty-one men that go car lied you off that mountain and what did Elijah do call fire down out of heaven on 51 men say brother manthie what does all that mean it means rapture it means separation because immediately after he Elijah called that fire down he was translated and immediately after the third pole third Pole finishes up in the bride she'll be gone do you understand Elijah called fire down on a captain with his fifty then he sent a second set of men a captain what is fifty then that King sent a third group right and then the angel of the Lord came to lights that Elijah spare these right so 51 51 51 and here in luke 9:51 when it came time for jesus be caught up you got james and john wanting to call fire down so there's a correlation and association here that i recognize that's really profound in my heart because whenever it comes time for us to translate and everything like this will be that kind of ministry like elijah had when he called fire down is that right and of course that anointing will go be with two prophets and they smite smite the earth with plagues as often as they will but that kind of manifestation is associated with translation translation grace rapturing faith do you understand okay so if you go to the last chapter of Luke look at verse 51 with me Luke chapter 24 and verse 51 and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them right again another verse 51 where he's parted from them okay now go with me back to Luke because I actually want to go back to Luke 12 where I really wanted to finish up I'm so sorry for being like you know buckshot over here I do get scattered about all right thanks for your forget you and the business of forgiveness all right I'm so glad you are let's look at verse 54 in Luke 12 okay that's where we want to be huh now we read that one already we want we want verse 54 because that's the five in one house did you catch what I was saying there how many was in Rebecca's house LasR Rebecca bath or Laban and Rebecca's mom la zone Rebecca's two and those other three they got separated because when Eliezer got done with his ministry Rebecca was out of there and then he led Rebecca to Isaac isn't that what the Prophet fulfilled have you been in marriage you know what Christ now it's you and Jesus that's right but what about the Prophet the Prophet fulfilled his part everybody here loves brother Brandon we're not putting them in a bad light but we love Jesus Jesus Christ is the one that called us out through brother Branham that's right so right here it says and he said also to the people when you see a cloud rise out of the east when you see a cloud rising out of the south when you see it clouds rise out of the north when you see a cloud rise out of what happened out in west Arizona sky did a cloud rise huh now notice what Jesus is talking about in verse 51 think not that I'm come he said think not that I am come to bring peace but division the cloud appears in the West and straightway you say there cometh the shower what kind of shower did that rain cloud that that cloud bring a form of rain is that right it brought a form of rain let's read a little bit more it says here there cometh a shower and so it is and when you see the south wind blow you say there shall be heat and it cometh to pass you hypocrites you can discern the oh my boy scripture is really something with this message ain't it you got a cloud rising out of the West you got Jesus talking about a face you gotta talk about I am come to bring division and the bridesman separated folks do you see what I'm talking about you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that you not discerned this time the Lord Jesus was rebuking him for not recognizing the vindicated word for the hour now everybody recognizes God sent a prophet and the Lord took brother Brent home in 1965 but what has God been doing from 65 to 2019 does it draw a blank or do you know what part of the Bible you're in do you know what part of the scripture you're living in that's the thing eternal life is recognized in the word made manifest and God interpreting the word for your hour now what has been what is present truth that right it doesn't take much revelation now to say God sent a prophet everybody can see vindication it don't take half a brain to see a vindication but it takes the Holy Ghost revelation to see real revelation right so do you not understand how Jesus rebuked the people of his day for not recognizing he was actually scripture made manifest what about the scriptures now what part of the Scriptures being made manifest it's revelations 10 8 to 11 because God has already vindicated revelations 10 1 2 7 the Lord Jesus has already descended with a shout young people Christ has already come forth to call his bride he has descended with the shout that's why we got what we got Christ's personal presence is now leading the bride to the marriage supper that's right is that the truth so let's just go in a little bit here I think we can see some more sermons of the Prophet right than these passages the face in the sky and of the earth but how is it that you not discern this time what is this time this is the time where the bride's completely matured and perfected and then taken the marriage supper because I guarantee you that there is a 144,000 Israelites over there right now yearn and agonizing for the fulfillment of what's calling in their heart because of deep calls to the deep and if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond and Christ is going to have to profits minister the word in such a way that those 144,000 will come out sister and they will be distinct they will be defined because right now you don't know who they are but you if you was here but God forbid that she would be here but just imagine if you could if God would let you look down over the banister of heaven and the two prophets are on earth ministering you would be able to see who the hundred 44,000 are because their response to the message would tell on them the way they believe it the way they take to it the way that it has an effect on them because their predestinated to it is that the right is that right so he says in verse 57 yay and why even of your own selves judge he even mentions judge white wig right even though he says judging not what is right when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as that in the way he moved it on me as thou art in the way give diligence that doubt he moved it again thou may'st be delivered from him lest he hail thee to the judge yea and the judge deliver thee to the officer officer the Prophet brought an indictment the judge Jesus Christ the white wig right and then what souls that are in prison now the Lord Jesus had it just right didn't he then that Bible is really something when you got the message to go with it that was wrote nineteen hundred two thousand years ago then these last days of cloud pears in the West is the white wig Jesus Christ has convened court he's got an officer on earth to identify what's happening in the Bible and then he indict the generation for the second crucifixion of the Son of man son of God right and the church world has crucified the Son of God to themselves afresh they've been indicted because Christ has convened Court so there's people in prison when you go to Walmart you're looking at people that are in prison because if they don't know Jesus Christ in the power of the Resurrection and are illuminated to the present tense reality of Christ you cannot be nowhere else but in prison you have to be conscious of what Christ is doing today the present truth and be established in it not only has God sent a prophet but what you got after that I'm trying to show you continuity what has occurred what are you conscious enough to walk in the reality of what has transpired between the Gentile prophet and two Hebrew prophets it's revelations 10 8 to 11 brother Branham is the Gentile prophet Moses and Elijah will be two Hebrew prophets but their scripture in between their right brother Branham taught me to be this way everything has to be scriptural everything has to be tied to the scripture brother Brown I've seen a vision I see a vision but I always look for it in the Bible right so on and on it goes if you got a doctrine if you got a revelation you better be able to preach it from the whole Bible now this is what I'm into I like to be able to take it through the whole Bible see it all over the place amen you you believe that there's an endtime Bride here friends we need to stop looking at church and just look at the promise of God's Word because of God's words that our Lord God said that there'd be a church here with a sin free church without spot without wrinkle people who totally overcome themselves people that totally overcome carnality people that overcome sin death held the grave Satan's Eden the ecumenical movement everything then time bride is so inoculated against sin she can't even die that's the kind of people we're talking about here damn it [Applause] what's the wages of sin can you attribute send to the bride brother branch said there's no fault in her the end time bride is the omega bride the prophecy of the bow says the glory of the latter house will be greater than the glory of the former those precious Saints we're no more elected than they are but the difference is this is the age God promised to make these things vindicated so if they're in that age and the Omega bride Saints drifted into Ephesus where's this bride gonna go she's going to the marriage supper of the Lamb because there's no other scripture that declares anything else it is so helpful to your faith to examine the word and see type shadow allegory the prophetic revelation of the Bible to see exactly how what has all been made up to and what you're walking right now because God can't change this word what did Ephesians what did that word and Ecclesiastes say I'd like to read that again check this out all that has been is right he says that which has been is now and that which is have been already hath already been right so it's very simple young people this is not hard if you understand type and shadow listen young people listen Isaac you've heard brother Graham say and teach that Isaac is a perfect type of Christ right well whenever Abraham was told by the Lord to offer his son Isaac up on a mountain that he would show him Abraham packed the wood on the back of Isaac and Isaac carried the wood up the hill that was the Lord Jesus he was betraying Jesus carrying the cross up the hill brother branham tells us and history tells us the very hill that Isaac went up is the very hill Jesus was crucified on that's not hard folks it's typology it's prophetic foreshadowing of a great thing God would fulfill if God did that then then he brought it to pass in the days of G he doesn't now the Lord spoke seven squirrels into existence through the prophets lips then brother Brennan says that was God commissioning for me to do something that was God's commission to me he was commissioned to reveal seven thunders seven seal mysteries so whenever the seven squirrels were spoken into existence that type the seven mysteries being spoken because the seven squirrel was hit a little bit deeper than the other six and the seventh score was underneath a piece of bark and a leaf the bark represents the doctrine of holiness the Wesleyan age and the leaf represents the Pentecostal age then after that comes the meat of the word are you eating that meat are you feeding on that and brother Branham said immediately after the seven squirrels had II was told to speak and what does the woman represent church bride had he represents the bride being brought into speaking conditions after the seven church age messenger speaks seven mysteries then you got a bride that's the way it's been patterned in the Bible right so all that has been is now right and all that hath already been right or and that which is to be hath already been even everything that you have right now in your present hour you can see it back in the Bible everything's been foreshadowed right three kinds of believers all three of those kinds of believers have been foreshadowed in the Bible amen so I just want to encourage you to seek the Lord for a clear understanding of your present hour because you know what's happened to a lot of people their faith stopped in 1965 they have not went on they're scared to death to read the next verse after revelations 10 7 John represents the bride the bride supposed to take the seven sealed open book and eat it and then become the final voice to the final age that's exactly what brother Brown said in the church age book he said the voice of God will be in her that's right whoo-hoo I wonder if I should read this quote hmm there is a statement in the church age book where brother Bram said this image would try to stop the bride from teaching and preaching right now we know not everybody's qualified to preach brother Brenner said if you ain't met that pillar of fire face to face you ain't got no business in the pulpit if you don't know Jesus Christ and a poverty rich and what are you doing handling the word but you know what happens people get enthused because they hear a vindicated prophet preach and they get all excited and they think they can take a pulpit that's way too many people we've already seen people be raised in the message pastor a church and then claim the cloud was by for missile from the US Army how in the world that man getting a pulpit where's the discernment when brother BAM caller similarly apostles discern their preachers they discern their apostles you know what the problem is I just flat-out sitting and I'm gonna get out of this pulpit the people with the genuine Holy Ghost are far and few between the really let is fear not little flock so we have to kind of just walk in love amen walk in love well friends I hope that I have whetted your appetite to study to dig to really take the prophets message back to the Bible meditate in Scripture amen revelation is for young people this for old people it's for middle-aged people because it's the Holy Spirit that imparts it amen so god bless your precious hearts amen you love the Lord give him praise well thank you so much I know sometimes we just kind of rush in town you know we're kind of limited and I feel a little strained you know probably not as relaxed as I should be and I apologize for that but uh it's my fault yeah but it's just you know we got a run back to mobile and get back into the saddle there and everything but it's been a wonderful privilege to be with you always an honor to fellowship with my precious elder brother our pastor here and God bless brother Wade I appreciate him coming down and sharing the love of Christ with us in mobile and and Hillman sister June opening the house and all your all's attention to the word god bless you precious brother Bob I think I seen Bob brother Bob's dad and mom god bless him so much good to see y'all so happy to see it's been a long time what y'all been god bless you praise the Lord brother Lewis god bless him in his ministry and brother Aaron Roberts brother Bob I believe they're going down to Jacksonville Florida amen god bless them people there there is children of God scattered everywhere and we should pray for the bride because she has to come to that place of absolute maturity and don't never get caught up in sectarianism and churchianity and this group and that group and the groups because it's an individual affair always remember that friend it's an individual fare you are an individual before God it's your responsibility I don't mean to keep on but somebody literally look me in the face and told me I would be a Christian if it wasn't for my husband he's so mean how in the world you gonna say that before God on the day of judgment I can't be a Christian because of my husband huh that doesn't that's not gonna work friend you you can't blame somebody else for you not being a Christian it doesn't work I'd be a Christian if it wasn't for that mean old church up there that doesn't work the Christian is an ordained affair anyway God calls you to be a Christian do you think somebody some other mortal can cancel out your election no chance no way you think God works his business like some haphazard thing he hopes he could save you in the end God's really just trying really hard hoping that you'll just cross that finish line you know the truth friend if you cross that finish line at all you cross before the foundation of the world God God's already got it fixed up all you got to do is walk with him Enoch walked with God and he was found not brother Brennan was in the Coronado forest and God says why don't you walk with me for a while and when he was walking with God he felt his hair come back he felt younger than me that would grab his Army's walkaway meter in the wilderness he was turned back young and what was he doing walking with God walking with God that's what you got to go friend personal intimate reality not you and your spouse and your kids and your church and your neighborhood just you I'm sorry I have to say it that blunt for people to get it you and Jesus that's all but but I want my wife to go on the rapture that's between her and Jesus Jesus is the one taking her rapture not you her association with you does not put her in a rapture get that straight your association would have pastor your association with a church you can love brother branham and miss the rapture you have to know Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection okay let me say it like this who is it that gives the baptism of the Holy Ghost only Jesus Christ so who do you got to talk to to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right asking it shall be given is what the Bible says if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ask him why do people always try to qualify their Christianity of other people what do you get out of other people believe in you're a Christian you want God to recognize your Christian and then God will give you the honor and the notoriety from heaven that's what you should be seeking for not to be noticed by other flesh-and-blood people you can live a life of faith and be noticed by heaven that's what the angel told Daniel Daniel since the day you started praying we started making our way to you Daniel you're greatly beloved from up there that's the way you want to be friends because all that live godly in christ will suffer persecution and then they added a scripture but most likely they will suffer persecution by other people who professed to be living with christ huh but that's the way it is so do you understand did I know I shared a lot of technical things with you but it's really profound the way the message is opened the Bible and we see a bride going into the marriage supper we see it all pattern out for us and shout voice Trump the Lord Jesus descends from heaven and he has been here on the earth and word form in the form of the Holy Ghost anointing and endtime bride moving in individuals people are clamoring for a move of God they want to see a revival and their prophet told them all kinds of ways he could revival is over there is no more moves don't look for no big thing now it's just gonna be an absence of people that's right I'm sorry but that's the way it is did you know brother Branham taught after God discerned Sarah's heart in the tenth then their bodies turn back young again that's how you get between the the prophets gift of discernment and then the body change that's it what you've been looking for a worldwide revival you're looking for the United States to have a revival the church worlds have an ecumenical revival you want to hook up with that God have mercy there's no other revival but the only revival you can have in your soul with Jesus you and Jesus you're supposed to be able to pray through and enter into the presence of God brother Branham says I get alone and I can hold my mind with a power in prayer that reaches beyond the Moon the Stars that gets ahold of God somewhere that's why every single one of you supposed to be to be able to get ahold of God that's right let me get out of this pulpit for you don't god bless you all so much we love the Lord Jesus
