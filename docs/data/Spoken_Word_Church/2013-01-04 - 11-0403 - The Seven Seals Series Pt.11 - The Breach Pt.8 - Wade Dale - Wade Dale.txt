========================================

scripture today but we're going to job 14. so this is going to kind of lead us into the this will be the last subject or the last uh Sunday school class on the bridge and I hope everybody's important okay I don't think so on the bridge so that'll be the last subject we last Sunday school class we'll have on it and I hope everybody understands that he speaks of redemption bottom line shows the whole Redemption of man through Jesus Christ all right Joe 14 let's just read the whole let's get the whole whole point let's read the whole chapter is that all right read the whole chapter Job chapter 14. I'm gonna go ahead and shut the door again foreign last weekend but he was here Wednesday night but that's okay this is the class here we need to worry about chapter 14. man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble that's men and women man yeah I feel better right hold his head I told Kathy you ought to talk to Raymore this morning and raise it don't care know what I think I'm fine they're a cute couple yeah that's right he coming forward like a flower and it's cut down he flips also as a shadow and continues not and does thou open Thine Eyes Upon such in one brings me into judgment with thee question who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean thing not one Joe got a revelation that he needed a redeemer that was not born like he was born all right so and that's what we're seeing in Revelation 5 we're seeing a lamb a bloody lamb somebody that could take that book there was no human see John could take just what job was saying there was no human none good no not one remember John was weeping because he couldn't find anybody that was worthy who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean thing not one that's why Jesus had to come through the womb of a woman to clean it up make it right he didn't make it right and we started becoming spiritually born though he had to come through to say hey this is what I've got to do to clean this whole mess up because that's where it started and then of course we understand that it started in Mary's mind first and it started in Eve's mind first and then the conception happen through the body all right seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass in other words when it's your time to go God knows it's your time to go and you're going to go all right turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as in hiring his day for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease so what's job doing he's looking at a tree they cut it down he said well it's dead no next spring Here Comes life right out of that tree again but he sees man go down and man does not appear again all right foreign though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stop thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth vowels like a plant but man dies and wasted the way yeah man give us up The Ghost and where is he as the water fell from the sea to flood of the chaos and drives up so man life down and Rises not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep right hey hold it now wouldn't hide me in the grave and that's what God's doing he's hiding the people in the grave like we were talking about last night about killing and stuff about you know killing little children and all that god did did those amalachite babies a favor by killing them when they were young so they could go to heaven so he's hiding them away in the grave that now what is keep me secret until thy wrath be passed in other words all this is going on that's why we don't you know disclude people that are that are gone on my they're they're resting in a place much better than this that thou would have keep me secret until I wrath be passed that now what is to point me a set time and remember me always when I when I have a friend pass away I said Lord remember them I said if you remember me if you're going to remember me as a bride then you'll have to remember them okay because remember we're able to impart eternal life to people I have to watch on judgment if a man dies shall he live again that's a question all the days of my appointed time well I wait till my change come then what did he say in my flesh I shall see God so he has to invert that's in chapter of what 16 or 17 or 19. see so job is keeping his thought together about this man Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou will have a desire to the work of thine hands for now thou numberest my steps thus thou not watch over my sin now here's the one we're going to start with right here and head into the first seal my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou soweth up my iniquity my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sowing stuff my iniquity how about that because we're going to look in the first seal and we're going to see the mystery of iniquity it's going to have to be done away with us now job is prophesying of a change I'll rest in the grave in other words till my chains comes because remember when God first the ground and for reading Corinthians just for a point let's read Corinthians 15 first sorry First Corinthians 15. daddy read it last week verse 42 answers the whole question so also is the resurrection of the Dead it is sown in corruption your body came out of this Earth that was cursed from the Garden of Eden so there's only one way for you to get it back is is for you either to be changed or go by the grave go down under the crust of the earth everybody understand that in other words Donna You Gotta Die to be Resurrected you can't resurrect and be alive you got to be dead that's spiritually and so as naturally all right now let's not talk about to change the body right now let's just talk about the people that have gone on they couldn't come to this Revelations 5 and Revelation 6 Revelation that we have in this day to where we can walk out of here without seeing death all right because the resurrection message has to be preached by a live group of people right all right which is Jesus Christ he said I died one time and I'm Alive Now forevermore all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me a flesh Man Standing on the Earth called Jesus Christ and guess what you and I were in him when he said those words in spiritual multiplication into Genesis 1 26 that he was but that Genesis one man had already come out and overcome that 2-7 man that Mary produced everybody understand that Mary Mary didn't produce the body we know that but it come out of America all right which was what Earth okay so that man that man that was standing there in Earth said all powers have a nurse been given unto me so that's the way you and I have to see it but look around here this is so all sorts of resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption now what do you do when you sow something not s-e-w that's this kind of stuff when you s-o-w-n you go outside tomorrow and you plant something you have shown it what into the ground and done what with it you've covered it up it was sown in corruption when we go and bury somebody we're planting them back into the ground and then what's going to happen that tree is going to come back up right see so Joe went far off job just didn't have a complete revelation of what was going on he said I see the tree and it comes back up I see the man let's see job was not the one to see the physical Resurrection but when we plant people in the ground we have to plant those into the ground I wrote in my Bible planted sown in corruption but see when it comes back up it's never going to go down again it's what it's Stone and Corruption raised in in corruption in other words it's some moral we put a mortal body into the ground we'll never see sister Hazel's mortal body again mortal it will be immortal okay now you said once I got to do Revelations five that is the culmination of redemption that's right redeem means to what bring back to its original condition the original condition was no sin in the garden well job right here is telling us he said you have took my sin put it away and even my iniquity you're doing away with it now that's what's happening when we're going to start into the seal when we go into in my flesh I shall see God when we start in the first seal there is the mystery of iniquity that you and I have to contend with every day of our life so don't tell me you don't do things wrong and you know you shouldn't do them that's iniquity but now you've got to realize one thing watch let's read I saw it last night in the Bible study and I'm going to read it this morning it's in uh it's in Corinthians somewhere we're going to go this way because that's just the way I feel to go one one in six First Corinthians chapter six First Corinthians chapter 6. because this is what we've got to get over when we start into this you got to realize one thing we were all born in sand shaping in iniquity spouse from my mother's womb a liar okay and on our way to Hell lost Dune finish as far as human beings are concerned right okay now look what Paul said in First Corinthians 6 verse 9. now where is he at he's at the congregation of the Corinthians they're Christians but they have problems no you're not verse 9. let the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers these are getting pretty good these pretty bad people effeminate abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves narcovetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God if he would have stopped right there we would have never had hope of making it verse 11. and such were some of you I was one of that group but you're washed that ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God that gives us all a chance even though the ones that go by the great that gives them a chance so Paul was saying hey now that doesn't mean you can get up and do all these things right here over and over again yeah I believe he come to that Corinthian Church found that they were still babes still doing you know leaning a little bit to the flesh but I believe that church straightened up that church straightened up because remember the man that was living with his mother-in-law right yeah Paul rebuked that but he didn't throw a man out of church and like Daddy said a little bit later on brother Adam said he'd become a deacon in church pretty hard to understand there's Grace but there's not greasy Grace right you can do a lot of things that'll take you out of a position but he can't take you out of Christianity that's what I want you to understand even in these seals if you can't see all the seals and I can't see them all like I should if you can't see what's in these seals then then you know what that don't make you not a Christian right right that does not make you an unbeliever okay believe what you know brother Brown's even said in in the book in in questions and answers he's like go on with the same simple life be a Christian do your job work and raise a family be a man of the community a woman of the community but there's somebody there's going to be a group of people that's gonna that's gonna This is Gonna Break Forth on them and they cannot die amen and like Danny said last night he's in this age it's in this generation the one I'm looking at now right may not be mine may not be yours but it may be these children right right somebody's going to raise up and say I see what God has been talking about since the beginning of time and even in my flesh I shall see God because see job had to go through this journey I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days I don't see my redeemer all right in the last days this means after he's dead he's got to raise back up but see I hope you caught this last Sunday I didn't say it but I'm going to say it this Sunday in my flesh I shall see God right yeah I'm hoping you see that last Sunday and if you didn't that's okay but that's that's why we preachers save a little bit we don't shoot all our ammunition at one time we'll save a little bit for later but in my flesh I shall see God that's what job said knowing that he was going to die and be resurrected back again but there's a group of people standing in the end time that says in my flesh I shall see God without death in this place right here we're going to see God manifested in human flesh right not to see God as Jesus walking no right here I've listened to a song this morning that uh June had on the radio about the LaFontaine Family and it really struck me and we say that we're the final voice for the final age you ever thought about that final means there's no more yeah right final means there's no more and voice means one voice coming from one group of people God has entrusted all of past and Eternity on this bride right here right because there's no other voice denominations don't have a voice they have been cut off remember God's only going to hear one group of people in this end time and that's the people of the Bride that Jesus Christ right and not just the Believers of this message but you gotta believe this message to be able to take body change that's right you've got to believe this man you've got to have this message bred inside of you and you got to get rid of all the junk that we're doing and and you know we just need a house cleaning you know June and I've been going through today Ramsey Financial thing when we finished Friday night and we paid off a lot of debt we just have stuff laying around we clean house we got to clean a little more house but we didn't get an inheritance to pay off ten thousand dollars in debt and you know or a little less than ten thousand in six months we just had stuff laying around with it we sold that we got rid of it was a house clean we're not finished no it won't be six months you're right we just had this stuff well you know what that's the same thing with with the scripture we got stuff remember the old saying that the devil you know the devil had a meeting or meeting where he was at and he said hey these Christians are getting too christianized I'm gonna give them magazines and then I'm gonna give them movies and then I'm gonna give them television we'll come on down and I'm gonna give you the internet now you know how much time do we spend on the internet every week oh my God I know at work I spent about four hours on that thing just reading emails people can't talk to people anymore right but that takes up your time you gotta it physically puts you in front of something that you gotta read it but we can't get away from that right and listen God knew that this didn't surprise him when the computers came up or all these things you know and and you know God forgive me but all these people sitting around with these cell phones and the world's just going right on by you I've got one I've got an iPhone it's got all that junk on it just because the company makes me have it you know what it's happened today sitting in my house and if I if dings I'll pick it up and look at it but don't it's nothing we can't get caught up in this world you think this is away from far away from the seals it's not because the seals redeems this body and this body is the mo is motivated by what's inside of you and if what's inside of you does these things that we're going to talk about then you need to look at the motivator and I know we have jobs and I know we're connected but we should make it a lot better instead of setting out and I you know here I go again Facebook and all that stuff it's a waste of time it's a waste of time amen it's gossip don't tell me it's not it's gossip who's doing this who's pictures on the internet who's doing it that's taking your time away from God God don't care one thing about that junk and neither do I I wouldn't have one if they give it to me and told me they'd give me a million dollars I'd say and honestly I'm in church give me a million dollars to open a Facebook account I tell them forget it would not do it it's just junk it's gossip it's messy just gossip read this right here we got to get back to the basic right brother Brown comes up to the almost to the seventh seal and he's telling the people you've got to live a Christian Life right right we'll read it later you've got to live a good balanced Christian Life and see a balanced Christian Life is be with family be with friends talk to them don't become a hermit you know don't don't just crawl in a cave no God don't want them remember brother random wanted to do that he said Don I want to get in a cave and then jump out you know go out and do like a prophet God told him no he was a born-again Believer he wasn't like Amos and all those that were not born again that just went out there and condemned the people no that Prophet brought Grace so he had to live among his people to give the grace he had to be there with him he couldn't just stomp out and do things like that he had to become a pastor to the world the teacher to the world and the bangs was to the world that's what he was because he fulfilled all those five that we were talking about in the Bible Study last night but when we get started in this excuse me remember iniquity is something that you do that you know you shouldn't do yet you do it anyway that's right or something you should do and you don't do it that's right it's worth both ways what is that a balance that's what I said before you know June and I took that Dave Ramsey class it didn't take away anything of you know two hours a week we sat there everybody ought to have a solid Financial Foundation because God told us many times what to do with our money pay time save and a cheerful giver and then one in Proverbs says the the borrower is a slave to the lender and that's exactly the truth right it is that's why we're getting out of that fast as we can and you know I thank God that I had parents and even intentionally so they've been on a dead long time you know and you know what it makes a difference in your life it really does but let's get back on the subject but this is still this is still look when we go home every day when we go home or from church we go home it's the same stuff the devil's gonna start throwing at you all right and you know what watch the definition of of crazy are are being you know awesome is that you're going to do the same thing and get a different result see that's what that's what we learned in the class if you keep doing the same things you used to you're going to get the same result so change what you're doing you may get a different result you know I ask a lot of you to read in the Bible and read the you know read parts of the book how many of us do it how many of us don't do it then what are you doing you just say well that's just Tim when we gonna get away from that foreign God has said not putting me in a different place or but we got to believe what our pastor says even when he tells us some things that we don't do sometimes and I've been guilty of it myself right so what have we done are we doing it to him no are we doing it to God but we're hurting the worst person ourselves that's right this is a guy we're hurting that's right like Daddy said last night about uh you know the question came up about Thou shalt not kill well the amount of costs Joshua went in and destroyed them but but many times before like brother job Canada did some research remember the amount of Cox is the one that when they came out of Egypt they came in behind and started killing some of the people or started harassing some of the people and Joshua and Moses sent a group out and and God told him said hey you mess with my kids you're cursed for the rest of your life so the malachites are raised up and God and wipe them off well who did that they did it to their self right if we miss this thing it's not brother Dale's fault it's not my fault it's your fault it's my fault my fault it's our fault because we don't make it right and you know what God's gracious enough he'll tell you this is where you got off right here you took too much time doing this you took too much time doing that you took too much time over here you didn't give me enough time the person was going to take this change of the body is not going to be some superhuman person that walks around with nothing but God on their mind I'm sorry we're still human let's run the random said this thing will be sticky until it's changed right so we have to overcome this thing Jesus overcame this thing right here okay he said well he was virgin born he had no sin he had the same mentality we did he just let it work to the out what was inside of him he let it work to the outside more than we did because we're born in sand shape and iniquity Jesus didn't do things he shouldn't have done are the things he shouldn't have done he didn't do no he did everything he said I only do what father tells me now that don't mean one day he was eating and he dropped his plate and he said oh he's not God no that's just being human right we got to get away from those little human fallacies that that well you can't read right or you can't talk right well that thing got nothing to do with God you guys we got to start in this class today loving the Lord more than we did before because it's not going to be remember we do the same thing we get the same results okay that's Insanity that's right the definition of insanity is you do the same thing over again expecting a different result but you get the same one kind of like a drunk that gets drunk it gets drunk every night same results he's throwing up the next morning but he's doing it saying well maybe I won't do it this time no that's that's uh that's insanity and we got to get out of this in the same world right and hey we got to live here that's right we're not immune right back to Revelations 5 to finish it up Revelations 5 John was standing born again for 60 years but John had a problem he couldn't see somebody that had took all the sin and put it away remember you look for man he looked for somebody some human brother Branson all the prophets were there they all had their problems brother Brian had his problem he had things he couldn't do he couldn't handle money and stuff like that which is but you know what he was the greatest Prophet since Jesus Christ came on the Earth but but if you're not you know that's what people on the internet do they'll start say well they couldn't handle money and he couldn't do this and he couldn't the man brought a message a man brought a message straight from God to a specific group of people now he preached to the whole world to get a lot of people saved and Born Again under their time but when I'm talking about this time right right now all of us that are alive and remain we which are alive and remain you got to be that week right that's right if you're not that we you're going to go by the grave right right and somebody's not to bring you up this and with what you just said you you picture the message went all around the world but you can see magnets I'm sure I'm drawn to that message as one group it was just like Noah and the flood instead of God calling two by two animals he called two by two humans Noah's message went out for 120 years it must have went all over the world right because he condemned the whole world that's right right the whole world now you know we know that before the flood they were more civilized than us what if they had an internet but Moses was preaching to I mean no one was preaching to the whole world so what did God do to save the world for God so loved the world he gave them to God's son to do what to bring you and I in right he loved those creatures so he brought him in from all over the world to one place now brother Rams did not you know don't be gathered in one physical place we're not gathered in one spiritual Place Under the Dome of the message of the hour but born again Christians with a revelation of the message of the hour okay that's what we got to have we can't just be in the message we gotta have a revelation of the message and it's got to be able to change us and transform us into something that's never happened before right yeah yeah but you know what you came and you say well I've never happened before well it's going to because God said it was that's right and you know what Luther I would say probably a group of people called enough for Revelation said man we're going to see the end of the world but that little bit of just shall live by faith wasn't enough to get them out of there it was enough to get them in the body enough to get them born again but not enough to get them to change of the body Wesley same way great powerful man great powerful message went forth and people were saved and filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders father but their their uh age was determined to go down then Pentecost comes up greater age Wilder prophecy healing signs and wonders like never been before what do they do they stopped with a period so God said okay they're good people they're born again but I'm going to have to plant them until we get here right see that's what God's been doing he's been planting the Harvest he's been planting people all down through the church ages plant them in corruption because they went down in their human body but there's one group of people that's going to stand on the Earth because when you have all power in heaven and earth what did Jesus do even with just power over the earth when he was standing here he brought Lazarus out of the grave but remember he was sick and he had grown with a headache or maybe not sick but he was tired wearing worn but when he resurrected that man wasn't tired weary and worn he said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me okay so that's where we're gonna go from there we're going to talk about iniquity if you'd like to look up the word iniquity look it up and get the uh and you'll see a lot of them now brother Branham and I'm trying to research back and find out where he got it from most of the time you see iniquity it is a hideous sin that's your definition in Webster is a hideous sense well a hideous sin would be something that you know better to do and you do it anyway right Sans are saying the Hideous then means you knew better you did it anyway or you knew not to I mean you knew to do it and didn't do it okay that's the kids so that's something that we're going to talk about next Sunday uh more Blood Brother Claude and sister Ginger will be here with us next weekend so we're looking for a good time and uh next week will be June's birthday we may have a little cake and ice cream here at the church or something it'll have to be a big day because you'll be 50 years old
