========================================

he's with us today and the two sisters in the back and would you would you state your name address for nothing your name now they say state your name your Facebook page Twitter account and your Instagram so state your name where you from and you go to church he's a good man and that's my mom Illinois and he goes to church ok brother Henry same good road good wonderful good am Willa stamina they have their children with them and well she has her children but she has her child he done her child with him and she has children one good to have him here today what we're doing is we're going to stay on Daniel 70 weeks and this is part number 22 and we are beginning from the rapture of the church to that last week now as we spoke them many times before bro Luise and I will come by yesterday it's not like it when somebody I know somebody I know somebody's getting it when they can tell me what I'm talking about that's what I know that somebody's getting it well Luis was sitting there landing out and see if you can explain not by my revelation because my revelations do you no good you got to have your own right you got to be able to give an account of your own self of the hope that lies in you know that's the bottom all right give a reason of the hope that live within you so and there's two schools involved in the message but now remember there's no to school of thoughts in the Bible there's only one one because there's there's what the scripture says and that's it property God couldn't change it God can't even change it right God can't change his word he wrote it this way it is so we've been staying in Daniel 70 weeks strictly by the Bible knowing that is a Jewish time but if if the Jews is a timepiece then the Gentiles we're connected to Jesus and we're happy you will read right we're connected to the Jews right right all right so if Israel's our timepiece we need to look to them because remember we have no time piece we're just nations tongues were just a conglomeration of nations right but the Jews they are aced specific nation of Israel is specific nation they have a specific City to dwell in God gave them Jerusalem and that's the holy city so that's where that's even where we're going to do it all right so and he also give them specific things to do remember we went through all these days and all that so that's why we're still in to the feast day talking about them and we've come all the way through showing that Daniel 70 weeks is a specific time they have 490 years to be redeemed how you get that 70 weeks 70 of weeks what is the week seven days seventy times seven is what 497 years all right 70 there were not 70 days them two years they were in captivity no but remember though it's the seventy weeks of Daniel so it's actually seven two weeks so don't get confused with with the weeks because one week equal seven years which is for they got 490 so we we established a long time ago through the Bible and through even history that 445 bc according to Nehemiah that's when the Edit went forth to rebuild the temple according to Daniel 924 restore the city and the temple all right so we've come through now that the Messiah was cut off according to Daniel 9 he was cut off in a t30 killed put on Karl's crucified resurrected come back into the church ages for a couple of thousand year period but remember no time for the Jews coming for the Gentiles okay but we do know it started on that peg off in a t30 somewhere around there all right then in AD 70 Titus destroyed the city scattered the Jews and they've never been back in their homeland until nineteen forty-seven when the property god told us that Israel was now beginning to be a nation because they were gathering the people back together because remember the God who will not deal with Israel unless it be in their own nation in their own country to have their own nation okay so God wasn't dealing with him down since 1947 God has been dealing with them but not in a spiritual form as far to say this remember they get two prophets we're going to read that here they get two prophets they come and preach 1260 days there's going to be a hundred and forty-four thousand go see you can't number that's why the Bible when it says there's a number you can't you can't number that's Gentile code sure God knows the number but it's not a counted number all right it's not a counting number but now the Jews is the 144,000 that's it this is going to be saved after the rapture there'll be more Jews than that because remember the original twelve tribes back that began in Abraham right after Abraham's town see they're going to make it to heaven ok they're going to glory but they're not this what we see in Revelations 11 there was two prophets going to preach a certain length of time take out a certain amount of people then they're going to go into Raptor okay right Jo Ashline brother Brown said if we can see Israel as a timepiece and we can clock her time because brother man told us and see we haven't read hardly any quotes but I want to bring all the quotes for brother Brown said Daniel 9 24 is one of the most important scriptures in the Bible revelations five brother Brown said was the most sublime script come to bible because it speaks of redemption of everyone but Daniel 9 24 is one is the one most important scripture in the Bible wine it's a company's it's a context to tell us at the beginning of something and the ending of something if I got that we just background a little bit further from the new but this is this is years of studying it's like I told them for Eloise yesterday we were talking about talking about this and brother Dale's preach this many many times since nineteen seventy-four and people still don't get it let me it behooves us to go over and over and over till somebody gets it like I said today you weren't here but I gave you a little I gave you a rose before I buried you know okay okay thank you for telling it I said brother Lewis was talking to me about damn seventy weeks he was telling me what he saw he was telling me what he had seen to me that's the best thing I don't want you to go say something brother you know I don't even want to say hardly what brother branham's you know brother I'm said brother I know you're living bible yourself you need to become the quote book you know you know that was the problem with the fair sake they said we've got Moses his quote book jesus said if you don't know Moses you know me oh you're doing you know what he was telling them you're just reading the papers you're reading the letter and then you come back in the bar when you see that the letter kills right but I very good block if you got the Holy Ghost they'll have to connect with the word somewhere all right so and here we go in this last week because I got old r Eloise in the Bible it has three time periods according to national 924 a seven-week period member we covered that 77 249 that was the building of the temple then we had a sixty two week period okay so 62 and seven is what these details last seven 69 when I wait a minute we got 70 weeks we've got to determine I know y'all had to have that up real quick 62 plus 7 is 69 not 67 and a half there's no half than there because the people in the message see that most of the people in message see say that three and a half years happened in Jesus's ministry and there's only three and a half years left after the right to the church that's not correct there's only three odd years of Jesus's ministry after the rapture of the church but there's one week left to finish damage during the week I don't care who said what the Bible says there's a seven-week period a sixty two week period and a one-week period I want to 62 like in here we go what is 62 plus 7 plus 1 is that completes it so the chart we had before was 62 weeks and seven is 69 so when Jesus was crucified back over here what Jesus was crucified that cut off the Messiah that was 483 years take sixty nine times seven it's 483 years so now 480 three or four hundred and ninety- forename trees how much salmon there's eight the only needs more coffee or something promise caught up in this game is user right no you know what it always happens it always happens you know you got kids and they say these all funny things and they do this little funny thing but when you have company come yeah and you won't think ears to do the more funny thing they don't do and the visitors are going today before you say roll over play dead they're all over anyway well it's which one's the most which one's the most in Delhi no we've got 483 years already finished not 486 and a half go that's what the people of the message say that brother Brown said what you did not say it in the way they said he said okay he did say there's only three and a half years left after the rapture of Jesus's ministry right no doubt right but the Bible says is one week level so the Prophet can't deny the word the word can't deny the Prophet okay so there's one week left after the rapture now if you'll go to the six-fold purpose and watch the six-fold purpose what is the 64 purpose we can almost tell it by heart number one is finish the transgression to make an end of sin 3 make reconciliation for iniquity for bringing everlasting righteousness filezilla division of prophecy in six and North amor Foley now how you're going to do all that according to what the peoples of Messi's and I'm telling you 99 percent are the people the message have it wrong I'm sorry it's just what it is they have it wrong because look how you gonna bring in everlasting righteousness not too much holding cell division they didn't have a battle of Armageddon destroyed all that's right because the Bible's plane I was reading on over further about talking about the Battle of Armageddon the Battle of Armageddon and we read it last week and jacob's trouble God is going to destroy every nation then we read that guy's going to destroy every nation the Israel was dispersed it ok so this battle here I was telling the lease yesterday this battle is it's not spiritual battle this is a physical battle right this will be heathen against heathen man against man they're going to throw everything at each other and it's going to be an atomic explosion yeah right right not in those fired it look you got it that's way over and then by the dog and makeup okay cuz remember this battle doesn't kill spirits he just killed human beings right all right that's it this kills human beings there's nobody in this battle there'll be no by on this battlefield level that will have God in them or around them the great that's correct you got to watch these things all right the Battle of Armageddon it's not going to be a one-day battle okay one more time it's not gonna be I'm not going to be a one-day battle it's going to be a several maybe even a month or a year cuz if you blew if you shut up every atomic bomb they have on the earth somebody's gonna live through at least but what the half-light in the Bible they tell that the man will stand and his flesh will fall off while he's still alive when our last radiation told this i mean no John just didn't know he was looking at it because we may read it in a minute revelation 13 the image to the Beast which is United States makes the world to wonder because they can cause fire to come down out of heaven wow what is that that's war that's weaponry weaponry bombs just left that in Jocelyn in the street yep like Johnson in the streets it was it was cars but he didn't know how to say car alright so let's go to revelations 11 let we're going to continue right here so so the way I see it the way we see it is there's 400 three years have been finished so there's seven years or one week left he shall make a covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he's going to cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease i'm quoting daniel 9 27 if you don't have your Bible okay if the middle of the week he'll cause of the myths he'll cause the sacrifice no blessing the seats he'll kill these two prophets we're going to read it here in a minute they're going to take a rapture and then all heck is going to break loose for a period of time okay but now remember another thing that people don't realize this daniel 9 says the people and the city daniel 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people Jews and the holy city so there's two things got to be restored so how you gonna restore the city right here if what people in the message say that that said Dana seventy weeks the ends right here well My heavens you've got all this stuff over here that you got to deal with you're out of the Bible and let me quote one more time there is only 1260 days left of Jesus's ministry there'll be no ministry over here right but to rebuild that city according to his ego listen how many of you ready to leave you 42 44 the raise your hand making them about you but if you ever do read it okay you read everything else you stay on Facebook three hours but you won't read 15 minutes for the particular one more time hello okay facing the wrong way but you thrive you facing their own book don't be placing a book one day but not a facebook but if you'll read Ezekiel 42 44 it is honestly it's a little bit not boring but it gives you dimensions but if you will start in 46 248 read 42 44 46 to 48 is absolutely nuggets upon nuggets upon nuggets knowing what we know it talks about the glory of the Lord coming through the eastern gate well who's the glory of the Lord anoint the most holy revelations 1921 that's us coming back into that city but read about it and how he rules and raining and that all the tribes will be sitting there right over right there's twelve tribes three on this side three on this side just like they did in in in the Old Testament because remember everything is restored back remember remember the twelve tribes there was two that got put out down and Ephraim they went they they they went whoring other gods Oh God put them away and put Joseph and leave I am right but now when you read and we may read it later not today but when you see them brother round even tell he said when you see them coming into the Millennium according it looking as equal it puts them all a text Yoda back out coach Joseph its top across takes Levi's out cuz Levi I really never had anything to do with the twelve tribes he was the one in the middle or they weren't the one in the middle the priesthood was separated then there were twelve tribes that's right alright so but you if you'll read in Ezekiel 47 I think it is you'll see where all those tribes are all back in ordering in God did forget him he just put him away for a little while but he had to bring him back oh that's the original playoff drives all right what I don't remember how the Bible was in Israel at the eastern gate because I think that they're gonna literally come to an asian game they have put a semi cemetery mark in front of that Eastern yeah nobody can't go in like one thing for sure that city is going to be destroyed we know that that city over there that's now when we destroyed if they drop an atomic bomb remember it says it means drawing the day that abomination which is the mosque of Omar is right there next to the city if they drop a bomb man you know one thing I'm sure it's gonna lock the whole place out that's why very time they don't share its little that's why you don't have to come back and build the temple because it says to thy people and the city now how you gonna build a city right here damn seven weeks and right here home as most people in the message believe it ain't even court in the Bible and ain't even knowing make good sense 10 Lewis said yesterday said he made goods in and it doesn't once you read the Bible it doesn't make good sense you just got to understand what a prophet said all right so now let's go back to here we read Jeremiah 31 through 18 which is Jacob's trouble all right now we're going to read revelations 11 you can take your Bible or you can read up here on the screen if you want to now this is John on the Isle of Patmos and it was given me a read lock into a ride and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not freeze given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months now watch 42 months take 42 x 30 well right there it is they pull her 60 days i get adam for you now we'll give power and look he's going to answer it the next that's good and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1260 days one thousand a thousand two hundred and threescore was three times to 60 k 1200 1260 days clothed in sackcloth now who is that that's the two projects 1260 days but 42 months the holy city shall they tread under foot forty to it listen it's going to be peace just because the Pope makes a contract with them but now remember they still things going to go on because what's going to happen is that's why I believe the Bible is very specific he says the city inside that city or around that city they're going to persecute these two prophets 144,000 their own people throwing people because that's where they're going to be living in preaching the Word of God and all those other Jews it's looking for the Messiah to come they're trying to establish temple worship they're trying to put this together they're trying now so what if you spent all you know what if you spent 30 years trying to put a temple together and two guys walk in and start preaching in that temple like Jesus dip same thing walk in and say this is freakin mortar the one that you're looking for is already come and matter of fact he's here in us all of those digits like the DG since Jesus walked inside it I am the bread of life know where she goes in on the feast of unleavened bread in there over there eating bread he said I'm the bread of life they said you a man make yourself done that's what they gonna say to these two witnesses so there's going to be turmoil but they're they're not going to be able to be cut for 1260 days just like Jesus couldn't be touched for 1260 days right he preached three and a half years right okay same thing the anointing are beyond these two prophets and will be able to kill them these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and Feeny man will hurt them fire proceedeth our Mountain devour their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven now who that who did it he lied to shut the heavens for how long a half years he knows how to do it that's why Elijah and Moses no watch that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood who did that Moses turn the Nile River completely into blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will Wow if they want an earthquake to happen guess what all they got to say that's right if they see an army coming after all they got to do is just say God open up the earth and swallow him I don't county belton they gonna be hated absolutely said he opened up the and took Dayton and Cora all these all these types in the Old Testament are going to be fulfilled right here in these 1260 days all right look and when they shall finish their testimony right about here that all right we're going to have another you are here button and we did that last last you are here well as we're talking you are here and then okay right at that 1260 day time period got it and when they shall have finished their testimony of the Beast that ascends a thousand bottle of the pits you'll make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them okay and their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our Lord was crucified so that is where Jerusalem night and day of the people in Canada in tongues and nations shall they gonna be sending facebook messages and instagram and hashtag two people are dead that we hate you know I mean really that's what's going to happen because what happens see the whole world's gonna see CNN CBS MSNBC they gonna turn their cameras on them into because what happens and they did dwell upon the earth shall rejoice all the nation and shall send gift one to another that's an old Roman tradition sending gifts when open about it was over and they'd win a war they'd send a gift somebody she'll send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth and after three days and a half lead back to that three and a half day period again so it's now three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood up on their feet and what about a reporter standing there reporting on these two decaying rotting dead bodies no way that's not too far-fetched because when when they kill Gaddafi couple years were here but they would show his but they were dragging his body around and everything never reported an all-around sure we remember when Saddam Hussein was executed you know huh yeah that showed it right down there yeah yep so I mean it's right it's really it's not it this is just a precursor to what's coming this is just shows what's coming all right all right know what they they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon them what saw them now we all remember one thing it's not spoken in the Bible but we realized that those 144,000 we're going to have to be killed also they don't have to be killed all right and they heard a great force boys from heaven no I'm sorry they stood up on two feet great fear fell upon them look solid and they are a great voice from heaven saying up to them come up hither now what happened to revelations for one John heard a voice that said come up hither that was the rapture of the bride you and I right so we come over a little bit further and right here after the 1260 days there's going to be another rapper come up hither that's right alright so the 144,000 and the two Jews are going to be off the earth that's why i said when you come to this battle of armageddon there is no christian anything it is raw heathen brother brownie even says the Holy Ghost is lifted off the earth so there's really no mercy when those two prophets leave this earth there will be nothing but absolute chaos okay the great tribulation the man I mean this is the Tribulation Period but this is the great tribulation all right but I watch and they had a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in the cloud and their enemies beheld them in the same an hour it was a great earthquake a tenth part of the city fell and the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven didn't do them a lot of good but still there might be a little time period in there where some of the Jews may try to get you know may try to get saved or whatever you know but me too too too late look what we talked about the wove the first whoa was to what First World War right the second wall is the Second World War all right now the third world war is not here no even though the raster take place for the Gentiles and there will be tribulation of earthquakes and all these things and these two jus these two prophets are going to be call it down firing whatever that's not the third whoa cuz look the second Bull has passed and behold the third whoa coming quickly third world war valve Armageddon termination of forces that's all nations that are left we're going to try to survive so they're going to be killing off millions of people I mean you got seven billion people on the earth it's gonna take a while to kill them all but they all got to die and the seventh angel sounded there was great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever the four and twenty elders which set before garland seed fell on the face and worship God what they're seeing all this culmination 144 thousands in their place now the two witnesses are in their place scriptures been fulfilled for everyone that has the Holy Ghost in their soul all right because remember you can't say everything is completely over because the foolish virgin is going to be living during this time and have to die give their life for what they believe they're going to go into grave and the Bible says that you won't see them for another thousand years right now they'll be given eternal life so you can't say eternal life is over no but you get all you can say hooting the problem with them they didn't have you Karloff in their soul all right all right though there was preaching that now you know about sold the spirit the body and all that you can be anointed on your spirit the Holy Spirit be true and you be false inside but right here everything goes up there's nothing left here but raw healing and they have a battle the nations were angry and I rapped is coming the time of the dead they should be judged see that's coming over here that now shooters give rewarding that I serve as the Prophet to the Saints and then they feel their names mulund great to destroy them once and should us destroy them which destroy the earth the temple of God was opened in heaven and they were sending his temple the octopus Testament they were liking voices nunneries earthquake and great hail God had lifted everything off the earth it was anything righteous because look I remember one thing seventy weeks is not finished yet though she don't got three and a half years left to do what build the city cuz everything is destroyed here right so they'll rats right there I don't have any quote for that and I don't have any Bible for that but I think we're supposed to read the love letter that's in between somehow them to the 144,000 killed you are going to have to come back here and right here they're gonna they're going to have to finish that's a for example of a temple but they're gonna have to build temple how I don't know the wait a minute hold on remember they only took him 52 days to build a wall back in natural time without any kind of equipment right okay so they can build this thing in short length of time but then revelations 19 one is when the seventy weeks of Daniel is over when you read Ezekiel when that glory of the Lord enters at temple the bride 144,000 and the city has all fulfilled the redemption was written in this book for the ride 144,000 to witnesses they filled you Old Testament Saints you got it because you can't say redemptions fully over until the white throne judgment that's great because the because the fit the hunt the food is virgin is going to be given eternal life that's Redemption water about a cup of water my name anything like that they're over here so you can't say but what you can say is seventy weeks are finished 490 years in the restoration of Israel you say rather less and less that that's been a longer than that you guys take out the time of the Gentiles remember because remember I don't have what do you learn icon somewhere the charge it brother branham drew if I have that think I'm I with this chart that brother branham do watch if you were to take out the Gentile codes remember as we were talking the other day the wild olive branch was grafted in Luke 21 24 we were grafted in if not this would have come together and God would have finished the seventy weeks of Daniel right over here we've been left out ok ok this is the chart to brother brown drew now this is a revision of it I've got one of the original charge so i keep it at homes and i don't wanna lose that that's one he drew on a piece of paper in a restaurant that's the one he drew it the entire night all right according to Rebecca brown she drew that picture on the blackboard for brother ground to use during the same two weeks and am taking picture this one over here says not that one that one that one this other one now look this other one did you have somebody asked brother brought him a question about that later on he was at a restaurant and he grew it drew that on the piece of paper which is the same drawing is that one alright so there's a time of Gentile if you were to put this back together they'd been only four hundred ninety years she took out the time of the Gentiles 2,000 years and then button you got us going into rapture then you got one week or seven years left all right the matter those people don't come back in do I know oh jesus what kind of bodies or whatever I don't know I really know I really don't know I have no I know I have a lot but kind of floor it's gotta be something hot gotta be something like that but I would think that maybe that they come back in a glorified body but it's not because he means you travel like the thought we wasn't it we don't need to build a city where were we r glorified but somehow they got come back and build that temple brother Brian said many many times it is leaky or 42 44 is the Jews building that temple and in the Millennium you say okay what about the Millennium they look the Millennium you remember what we talked about lamp over mmm because we're going to read this in a minute something you to study on later on you got now one week at seven years yes right right 1260 days and then you got 1260 more days which makes 2520 days you got that 1260 plus 1260 is twenty-five hundred and twenty so there's got to be 2520 days to hear right but now let's go to daniel 9 real quick I mean Daniel nothing a man Daniel 12 this is all about Michael standing out fighting for the people time of trouble such as never was that the nation never had that time the people shall be delivered every one that should be found written in the book come back right here all right let's going over at save time now watch this is daniel now remember this is daniel now i want you to look at this real good and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders this is daniel asking and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when you build up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever you remember with that happen also revelations 10 1 through 7 the mighty angel comes down puts one foot on land one foot on sea and swear by him and live forever and ever that time shall be no longer that's to the Gentiles kind of shall be no longer there's no set time but watch this this is to the Jews because Christ is going to come down into profits really revelations 10 one is to the Jews because remember revelations for one we go up and not seeing the revelations 19 everything in between them Jewish so what's this swear by him to live from there whenever that be for a time times time times and a half what's that yeah all right and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power the holy people all these things shall be finished all right guy and I heard but I understood not Daniel didn't understand they said I Oh Lord what she'll be the end of these things he said go away Daniel for the worker closed up and sealed till the time of the white and so it's going to be open he said it sealed until the time of the end saying that when the top of the income still be open back up many shall be purified made white wicked will do wicked we know that's all happening right now watch nella and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up he breaks the Covenant right there right ah that's right he walks into the temple and he decimates the temple or desecrate the temple the Pope comes in says I'm god you gotta worship me right here there shall be 1290 days 30 more days left over leftover it's got to give us into the Millennium but when I finish blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the 1,335 days that's 45 more day good about it right ok now this is where we're going to begin to get a little bit tricky because you have to go back you're gonna study feast days because if these days are not done away with they're actually full all fulfilled and you need those two time periods to fulfill you munch up goes remember this this is their Jubilee well I'm sorry I wrote about family if you believe to the Jews right there all right and time continues Khan doesn't end because remember if the seven churches continued on you showed up brother Ram told us the Millennium is still the old seventh day their birthday not an 87 okay seven not eight seven continued all the way to the future home then he brings in an eight-day holy convocation that seat time because remember sin is still going on right here the devil still alive his little demons are still allowed they just can't work because they are bound but they're still there for one more Bible right over here the Battle of Gog and Magog next when God is going to rain his fire not man's fire this is man's fire he's going to rain gods fire over here and he's gonna kill him demons they but one person to kill the demon that's good you can't kill a demon
