[0:00] Yes, to whom shall we go? I think I
[0:03] think is the name of that. Brother Ryan
[0:04] can keep me honest when he comes.
[0:08] Um this morning I want to um deviate
[0:11] from Corinthians and and uh just talk
[0:14] about the resurrection this morning. So
[0:16] we'll go to brother to to Matthew
[0:19] 28 and let's bow our heads. Lord God,
[0:22] we're so grateful, Lord, that you you
[0:24] proved your word, Lord, on resurrection
[0:26] morning. and you're still proving
[0:28] yourself the same yesterday, today, and
[0:30] forever by that same life that's
[0:32] dwelling in believers. I pray, God, that
[0:34] you'll feel at liberty this morning to
[0:35] be with us, Lord Jesus, and open up the
[0:37] word to us, Lord. And and show us, Lord,
[0:39] the things that are that are hidden
[0:41] here, Lord, we pray as we walk through
[0:43] this scripture, be with us today. Give
[0:45] us what we have need of. Grant that,
[0:47] Lord, we ask in your name. Amen.
[0:51] So um Matthew
[0:53] 28:es
[0:56] 1-6 and it starts off in the end of the
[1:01] Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the
[1:04] first day of the week came Mary
[1:06] Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
[1:09] supplr and behold there was a great
[1:11] earthquake for the angel of the Lord
[1:13] descended from heaven and came and
[1:16] rolled back the stone from the door and
[1:19] sat upon His countenance was like
[1:22] lightning and his raignment white as
[1:24] snow. And for fear of him the keepers
[1:27] did shake, became as dead men. And the
[1:31] angel answered and said unto the women,
[1:33] "Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek
[1:36] Jesus which was crucified. He is not
[1:39] here, for he is risen, as he said, come
[1:43] see the place where the Lord
[1:46] lay." Now, just to kind of meditate on
[1:49] this that um you know, just to to kind
[1:53] of kind of put ourselves in the mind of
[1:55] the the believers when
[1:58] they saw uh when all of this went down,
[2:02] they they come and grabbed Jesus in the
[2:04] middle of the night, took him, beat him
[2:06] all that night, uh all Thursday night,
[2:10] all night long, early early Friday
[2:12] morning, taking him over to Herod, back
[2:14] and forth uh uh until he just uh didn't
[2:18] even look human and and then they
[2:21] crucified him and all of these things
[2:23] happened and the believers, you know, to
[2:25] think what you know, they they
[2:27] everything that they had put all their
[2:28] hopes and everything on this man and now
[2:30] they're watching him die and be put in
[2:33] the grave. So, you know, it says here in
[2:36] you kind of have to look at all the
[2:38] different gospels to put the complete
[2:39] story together. These these sisters,
[2:41] these women are going to the tomb, but
[2:44] they're not going expecting to see Jesus
[2:47] raised. They're actually going to anoint
[2:49] a dead man. And you know, you can read
[2:51] in Mark where it says that they they
[2:53] went they they didn't even really have
[2:55] it planned out. They're they're going
[2:57] like how how you're going to anoint his
[2:59] body with oil with oils and and and and
[3:02] spices and whatever to but h there's a
[3:05] stone in the way. And they actually said
[3:07] in in in Mark uh who who's going to move
[3:10] this throne back now to think that they
[3:13] and you know you could kind of apply
[3:14] that to your own life sometimes when you
[3:16] if you just have a plan you don't really
[3:18] even have things planned out say it like
[3:21] that that God will make a way. When when
[3:23] they got to the tomb then they found out
[3:25] that God had made a way that the stone
[3:27] was rolled away and there's an angel the
[3:30] angel there that said he he he ain't
[3:32] here he's risen now. Now, there's the
[3:36] that's kind of what brother Brandon was
[3:37] just preaching on in this message. You
[3:39] see, you know, when when brother when he
[3:40] was telling that story of the man with
[3:42] the apple tree and that that we're the
[3:45] whole the whole world is looking for
[3:47] something that will take take the gospel
[3:49] from just some words on a page to
[3:52] something that's real. They had heard
[3:54] the preaching for three and a half
[3:55] years. They had heard all all the words
[3:58] be preached and but they were still in a
[4:00] place of doubt where they couldn't
[4:01] believe. But then when you come to a
[4:03] tomb and there ain't nobody there, then
[4:05] you start, wait, wait a second, this
[4:08] this isn't just something that we
[4:09] learned about. This takes it from just
[4:11] education. It takes it something from
[4:13] just some a legend or a fable or
[4:15] something to something real. And and and
[4:18] so that the when Jesus died, you think
[4:20] that the disciple the follow his
[4:22] followers didn't really know what to
[4:25] think. In Luke chapter 24, it says it
[4:29] was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary
[4:31] the mother of James and other women that
[4:33] were with them which told these things
[4:34] unto the apostles and the words seem to
[4:38] them as idle tales and they believe them
[4:42] not. They think that even an eyewitness
[4:45] now isn't that the same way today that
[4:48] an eyewitness can come and tells
[4:50] something happened to me, something
[4:51] supernatural happened and it just it uh
[4:54] you know we struggle with it. And just
[4:56] like just like what brother Ron was just
[4:58] saying how in without Christ if you're
[5:00] not in Christ then it'll be like a
[5:03] puzzle that you just can't put together.
[5:05] You just can't understand. But when
[5:07] Christ comes and makes it a living
[5:09] reality see even when the two men
[5:12] walking on the way to to to Emmas they
[5:15] were telling Jesus who they didn't
[5:16] recognize that man that came out from
[5:18] the the side we trusted we trusted that
[5:21] it had been he which should have
[5:22] redeemed Israel. And beside all this,
[5:25] today is the third day since these
[5:27] things were done. And then when they
[5:29] went and told the disciples that they
[5:31] had met Jesus, they didn't believe him.
[5:33] They just thought that it was just just
[5:35] just words. And they they failed to
[5:37] understand. Yeah. You see, the
[5:39] resurrection morning is more than just
[5:42] it's more than just something about
[5:44] Easter bunnies and eggs that we hide in
[5:47] the field and things that the world has
[5:48] made it. But it's actually the proof the
[5:51] proof that that everything that Jesus
[5:53] taught is real and that and that same
[5:55] God is resurrecting lives still today.
[5:58] And that's the proof that the gospel is
[6:00] true. It takes away all the doubt. It
[6:03] takes away all the fear. You know I look
[6:06] at all all these disciples responses.
[6:08] When the women at the tomb went to the
[6:10] disciples they when when they saw Jesus
[6:12] they worshiped him but some doubted.
[6:14] When they actually saw Jesus they
[6:15] worshiped him but some doubted. It says
[6:18] Thomas said, "Except I shall see in his
[6:20] hands the print of the nails and put my
[6:22] finger into the print of the nails and
[6:25] thrust my hand to his into his side, I
[6:27] will not believe." When Mary Magdalene
[6:30] told him and she said, "And they when
[6:32] they had heard that he was alive, when
[6:34] they heard all the disciples heard that
[6:35] he was alive, believed not." The two
[6:38] disciples went and told everybody and it
[6:40] says, "Neither believe they them." And
[6:43] you know, all all these different
[6:46] examples, it it is it's ironic almost
[6:49] that his enemies believed his word more
[6:53] literally than his friends
[6:55] did. You know, Pilate was so uh so the
[6:59] Roman soldiers and everybody, they were
[7:00] so concerned that he was going to
[7:02] actually that something was going to
[7:04] take place that they put guards there in
[7:06] front of the tomb and sealed the tomb
[7:08] and put all these obstacles in the way
[7:11] to prevent something from happening. But
[7:13] you know, to a supernatural God, it
[7:14] don't matter. It doesn't matter. Now,
[7:16] there's something to think about,
[7:17] though, that when you and and there's
[7:19] all so many things coming in my mind
[7:21] right now about when the doctor comes
[7:23] and tells you something. It doesn't
[7:26] matter what the obstacles are. It
[7:28] doesn't matter what the obstacles are to
[7:29] a supernatural God. If God's going to if
[7:32] God said it, if God if God gave the
[7:34] promise, he's going to make a way for
[7:36] it. Amen.
[7:38] And look, despite all the times that
[7:41] Jesus had said he'd rise again, nobody
[7:45] was at the tomb waiting for him. No
[7:48] stake out, no sunrise prayer vigil, no
[7:52] anticip
[7:53] anticipation. Those sisters came to
[7:56] anoint a corpse, not greet a risen Lord.
[8:00] And Mark chapter 14 and John chapter 20
[8:03] says they scattered and hid because they
[8:05] were completely shattered. Now now
[8:07] there's the mind the mind the way that
[8:09] their thinking was. They they they had
[8:12] no no uh no rock because the rock is
[8:17] your revelation. No something
[8:19] supernatural taking place in your life
[8:22] to make the word something real. Nothing
[8:24] to hold them that John goes fishing.
[8:27] Everybody's running this way and that.
[8:30] it, you know, it would have felt to them
[8:32] like like the death of God's promise
[8:35] itself.
[8:37] And Jesus's death wasn't just a tragedy
[8:39] tragedy. It was a it was a
[8:40] contradiction. It turned their whole
[8:42] world upside down. That's right. And and
[8:44] you know, really to think now if if
[8:46] without the
[8:47] resurrection, his ministry, everything
[8:50] Jesus stood for, everything was in
[8:53] question. Was he the Messiah?
[8:56] The resurrection was when life
[8:59] re-entered that body. So now now there's
[9:02] the thing that it's life. It's life that
[9:06] settles the
[9:08] question. It's it's springtime now, you
[9:10] know, and I I thank God for some warm
[9:12] weather. You know, we've had we've had a
[9:14] a winter where everything's cold and all
[9:16] the leaves fall off the trees and and
[9:18] and finally the the leaves are coming
[9:20] back, the flowers are blooming, and and
[9:22] it testifies that it testifies that
[9:25] something supernatural is taking place.
[9:28] Just just like that story that Brother
[9:30] Random was telling of the of the man
[9:32] over in uh in uh near Campbellville.
[9:35] That's where I go preaching in in
[9:37] Kentucky a lot. So, I know every spot
[9:39] that he's talking about. I have stood at
[9:41] that apple tree where the stump is now
[9:44] and talked to the man that lives in that
[9:45] house and that lives five or six miles
[9:48] away from Actton Campground that he was
[9:50] talking about. I've stood behind the
[9:52] pulpit at actton campground before they
[9:54] tore the place
[9:55] down and and you can find all these
[9:58] other other stories where where brother
[10:00] Brown would say that that man at that
[10:02] apple tree that that he was talking to,
[10:05] he could hear them screaming at Actton
[10:07] Campground was like five, six, seven
[10:09] miles away. Because why? Because life
[10:12] something was taking place. When brother
[10:14] Rama said go home and lay that
[10:16] handkerchief on your sister and she's
[10:19] going to be well of cancer.
[10:22] What he's talking about is life and and
[10:24] see did you did you hear brother Brandon
[10:26] where he said that man wanted to know
[10:28] that it was more than just words on a
[10:30] page. Now now there's the thing and and
[10:33] he kept going on. If you pay attention
[10:35] he was going on. This this gospel is
[10:37] more than just education. It's more than
[10:40] learning because the life when life
[10:42] comes in the scene. That's what settles
[10:45] the question. And he wanted to see
[10:46] something supernatural. And so he he
[10:49] said, "Well, what what if I put a post
[10:52] up on on the fence? What would make the
[10:55] water would would the water in the put a
[10:58] bucket bucket up on the fence on on the
[11:00] fence post? Would the water go down into
[11:02] the ground? It is something different
[11:05] that in in a tree in a tree in that that
[11:08] apple tree that that I I stood next to
[11:11] that has been cut down now and then made
[11:13] a little lighthouse and put it in a
[11:14] church near there. But it it's something
[11:17] different that makes the sap in the tree
[11:19] go down in the ground is something
[11:21] supernatural. Now to think that that's
[11:23] the thing that struck something in that
[11:25] man to realize that that same God that
[11:28] can make the sap in the tree go down in
[11:30] the ground. That same God is the one
[11:32] that told him to go lay the handkerchief
[11:34] on that little sister in the prayer
[11:36] line. Sister at home that had cancer.
[11:39] That same God. What What is it? It's
[11:41] life. Life is what settles the question.
[11:44] Amen. You go out and that you go outside
[11:47] today and and and and there's concrete
[11:49] and asphalt and everything, but poking
[11:52] up through all of that, you'll find a
[11:54] little blade of grass. And that's the
[11:56] thing that scientists can't explain.
[11:58] They can get down and tell you what
[11:59] chlorophyll is and what all the
[12:01] different things are, but they can't
[12:02] tell you what makes it alive. And that's
[12:05] the thing that will boggle the mind of
[12:08] any scientist. What makes a Christian
[12:10] act the way they do? What caused Jesus
[12:13] to rise from the grave? It was life.
[12:16] Life is the thing that makes the
[12:18] difference. Amen. And brother Ram was
[12:20] saying the Easter Seal. He said if a man
[12:22] said like Columbus believe the world was
[12:24] round and they watched the ships as
[12:27] we're told how they come in and he could
[12:29] see the mast way before he could see the
[12:30] ship and it proved him that the world
[12:33] was round. People didn't believe that in
[12:35] that day but he was a man of vision. He
[12:38] set out to prove exactly what he had a
[12:40] vision of. That was the truth. That look
[12:42] what he's saying. He's saying people in
[12:45] that day believed some people believed
[12:48] that the earth was flat. Now if you if
[12:51] you're a flat earther just hold on for a
[12:54] second but he said Columbus when he was
[12:57] out on the ocean he could see the mast
[12:59] before he saw the ship. So that proved
[13:02] that the world was not flat. And and and
[13:04] and this is just how we do sometimes and
[13:07] we'll we'll we'll get something so much
[13:08] in our mind until we can't see the proof
[13:10] of it. And the proof, what we're talking
[13:13] about is the resurrection is the proof.
[13:15] The resurrection is the proof. And and
[13:17] Columbus could see the proof of it that
[13:19] the world was round. And and he said,
[13:21] "And God purposed to prove his word, the
[13:23] truth." So he there was only one man
[13:26] that could do that, and that was Jesus.
[13:28] And he come and prove that to be the
[13:30] truth. It sealed it. And that broke all
[13:32] the seals of gloom and scattered all the
[13:35] superstitions of other religions and so
[13:38] forth where great men has raised up and
[13:41] said great marvelous things. But there
[13:44] everyone in the grave but our Christian
[13:47] religion is the only one who has the
[13:51] empty tomb. And that proves to
[13:54] me that he is the God of the dead and
[13:58] God of the living. That he could raise
[14:00] up the dead back to life again. And this
[14:03] quickening power, quickening spirit of
[14:06] his has proved through the years that he
[14:09] is the one who can quicken the dead back
[14:12] to life again.
[14:14] Oh, there there's the resurrection that
[14:16] it's not a one-time event so much, but
[14:20] it's still happening today. That God can
[14:22] take dead, carnal people and and and
[14:26] change them through the through the
[14:28] spirit through his spirit so that he
[14:30] brings them from a dead place to a
[14:32] living reality of the gospel.
[14:36] You know, the devil was so to think to
[14:37] think about that scene that the sisters
[14:39] got to when they when they
[14:41] uh got to the grave that the devil was
[14:43] so afraid that he put guards there and
[14:47] he sealed the tomb. In Matthew chapter
[14:50] 27, it says, "Now the next day that
[14:52] followed the day of the preparation, the
[14:53] chief priests and Pharisees came
[14:55] together unto Pilate,
[14:57] saying, Sir, we remember that that
[15:00] deceiver said while he was yet alive,
[15:03] after three days, I will rise again.
[15:07] Command therefore that the sepico be
[15:09] made
[15:10] sure until the third
[15:13] day, lest his disciples come by night,
[15:16] and steal him away, and say unto the
[15:20] people, he is risen from the dead. So
[15:22] the last heir shall be worse than the
[15:25] first. And Pilate said unto them, you
[15:27] you got to watch. Go your way. Make it
[15:31] as sure as you
[15:32] can. So they went and made the sepical
[15:36] sure sealing the stone and setting a
[15:40] watch. Of course, now the seal separates
[15:42] life from death. Behind that
[15:45] seal, it's it's just it's just dead
[15:48] carnal understanding. But you break that
[15:51] seal and it actually
[15:52] reveals victory over sin, death. It
[15:56] reveal reveals victory over everything.
[15:58] It reveals something that was previously
[16:02] concealed. You know, to think that when
[16:05] those when those ladies got to that
[16:06] tomb, the stone wasn't really Did Jesus
[16:09] need Here's something to think about.
[16:11] Did Jesus need that stone to be rolled
[16:12] away for him to come forth? He had
[16:14] walked through walls. He could he he'd
[16:16] walked through crowds trying to stone
[16:18] him? Did he need that stone to be rolled
[16:19] away? But the stone was rolled away so
[16:23] you could look in there and see he ain't
[16:27] there. So they could look in there and
[16:29] see he's he's he's gone. The mechanics
[16:33] were laying dead in that tomb. The
[16:35] mechanics, the everything that would,
[16:37] you know, all the blood vessels and all
[16:39] the the the brain matter and everything
[16:41] was laying in that tomb dead. But the
[16:44] dynamics is actually what proved the
[16:46] doctrine. And what's the dynamics? The
[16:49] dynamics is the
[16:51] life all the way through the scripture.
[16:53] The dynamics is the thing that proves
[16:55] the dynamics. the dynamics when when the
[16:58] Holy Ghost comes and feels filled your
[17:00] soul. It's that's what proved that
[17:03] Christ is alive. Amen. You think you you
[17:07] know you can brother Brandon he would
[17:09] make this statement in in some of his
[17:10] earlier sermons. He'd say well you know
[17:12] if you could prove if you could walk
[17:14] through exactly how the gnats were
[17:16] created with Moses you know that would
[17:19] you know that would be helpful. But it
[17:21] was the dynamics when the gnats and the
[17:23] frogs were actually created. That's the
[17:26] thing that proved it's the life and
[17:28] brother in message presuming brother Ram
[17:30] said the devil knows it better than any
[17:32] of us. That's right. But he can't live
[17:35] it. It's
[17:37] life. That's it. He can't live it. See,
[17:40] that's the only advantage you got over
[17:42] him. See, he might know it as well as
[17:45] you do, but he can't live it like you
[17:48] can. Christ died that you could live it.
[17:53] and he never for
[17:55] him in the power of God. He said, "Let
[17:58] me tell you, if you want the devil
[17:59] stirred up, just start preaching divine
[18:02] healing cuz cuz that's what shows that
[18:05] God is alive." Preer Peter preached on
[18:08] the day of Pentecost and 3,000 soul
[18:11] souls was saved and Satan never even
[18:15] moved. But a couple days afterwards, he
[18:18] show he healed a man at the gate called
[18:20] beautiful who was lame and all hell
[18:23] turned loose on him. That's right. The
[18:26] devil don't like to see God display his
[18:29] power. Now you think about that that it
[18:32] that that it don't make the devil upset
[18:34] just to some somebody to preach a good
[18:37] salvation message or something. But when
[18:39] God begins to show his power that he's
[18:41] alive, right? That the devil wasn't, he
[18:44] said the devil didn't even turn over
[18:45] there on the day of Pentecost. But there
[18:47] at the gate, beautiful when Peter and
[18:49] John said, "I I got something that'll
[18:51] help you out. Look on us. Stand up if
[18:54] you believe." And at silver and gold, we
[18:56] don't have, but such as I have, I give
[18:58] to you. That's what made the devil
[19:00] upset. Amen. And the Easter Seal,
[19:02] Brother Aman said, "And I think I think
[19:04] God hastened the day that when we as
[19:06] Christians who believe this Bible can
[19:09] prove what we are talking about." See,
[19:13] that's what makes, as said a while ago,
[19:15] the salt of the earth. The sister said,
[19:18] "That's right. The world is looking for
[19:20] this salt. And when we can prove by our
[19:24] lives and by the Bible that our lives
[19:28] are vindicating that word to be living
[19:31] today that that's the day we're looking
[19:35] for. The resurrection is the proof of
[19:37] who Jesus is.
[19:45] In Romans chapter 1, it says,
[19:46] "Concerning his son Jesus Christ our
[19:48] Lord, which was made of the seed of
[19:50] David according to the flesh and
[19:52] declared to be the son of God with power
[19:54] according to the spirit of holiness by
[19:57] the resurrection from the dead."
[20:01] In Acts chapter 2, Peter said, "Men and
[20:05] brethren, let me freely speak unto you
[20:06] of the patriarch David, that he is both
[20:08] dead and buried, and his supplicer is
[20:10] with us unto this day." Therefore, being
[20:13] a prophet and knowing that God had sworn
[20:15] with an oath to him that of the fruit of
[20:17] his loins according to the flesh, he
[20:18] would raise up Christ to sit on his
[20:20] throne. He, seeing this before, spake of
[20:24] the resurrection of Christ, that his
[20:26] soul was not left in hell, neither his
[20:29] flesh did see corruption. This Jesus
[20:31] hath God raised up whereof we all are
[20:36] witnesses. And there's the proof of the
[20:38] resurrection. Hey, you know, if the
[20:40] resurrection proves who Jesus is, then
[20:42] the resurrection also proves who you
[20:44] are. In first Peter, Peter said,
[20:47] "Blessed be the God and Father of our
[20:49] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[20:51] his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[20:54] again unto a lively hope by the
[20:58] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[21:01] dead." It's the life. You know, you can
[21:05] we you could take a deep dive into
[21:06] things like this the seals. You know
[21:08] what the seals are all about? It's the
[21:10] life of Christ in in the church. The
[21:13] seven thunders are about the life of
[21:15] Christ being revealed. And you know
[21:17] what'll give you rapturing faith is to
[21:19] see the life of Christ in you. To see
[21:21] the life of Christ in the church. To see
[21:23] his his his same life walking and
[21:26] talking and and actually visible. And
[21:29] the life is what will make people want
[21:31] the gospel. In Matthew chapter 5, he
[21:33] said, "Ye are the salt of the earth, but
[21:35] if the salt have lost his savor,
[21:37] wherewith shall it be salted?" and the
[21:40] lamb and and and dove. Brother Ram said,
[21:42] "We were never asked to manufacture
[21:44] fruits. We were asked to bear fruits."
[21:47] He said, "We've tried to educate it and
[21:49] denominate it, and when we do, we turn
[21:51] out hypocrisy and failure." It's not to
[21:54] be done that way. It's to be done as God
[21:57] intended to do, be done the spirit
[21:59] inside of us, bearing fruits of his
[22:01] presence. That's God's program. It can
[22:05] never be changed.
[22:08] Now see the spirit actually answers all
[22:10] the questions. Now you know on the day
[22:12] of on on that resurrection morning or on
[22:16] the day of Pentecost there was a lot of
[22:19] questions that maybe people had in their
[22:22] mind. Did Jesus really
[22:25] die or could he have survived the
[22:29] crucifixion? Are the gospel accounts of
[22:31] the resurrection historically reliable?
[22:34] How how can we believe what the
[22:36] scripture says?
[22:37] Could the disciples have hallucinated
[22:39] seeing Jesus
[22:41] alive? Was the tomb of Jesus actually
[22:45] empty? Could somebody have stolen
[22:47] Jesus's body? Why why were the
[22:50] resurrection accounts written decades
[22:52] after the events? Is it even possible
[22:55] for somebody to rise from the dead? Now
[22:57] look, all these all these maybe are good
[23:00] questions. You know how when you when
[23:02] you come to Christ, if if you look at
[23:05] things with an eye like
[23:08] uh you know, you think about Jesus
[23:10] talking to that woman at the well, she
[23:12] didn't even need to see a miracle, but
[23:15] God just did one one thing for her. Just
[23:17] told her about her her past, and that's
[23:19] all it took to believe. Just one thing,
[23:23] right? I think about all these all these
[23:25] people, you I've watched uh videos
[23:27] online of people in brother Random's
[23:29] meetings. one one lady that's not even a
[23:31] message believer today. She said, "I was
[23:33] standing in the prayer line and I looked
[23:35] down as he discerned my life and I saw
[23:38] between us a wheel in the middle of the
[23:41] wheel circling." And she was talking
[23:43] about the supernatural that she had seen
[23:45] in the prayer line. Well, it that's all
[23:47] it should take is just one thing. Just
[23:50] one thing to hear about just one person
[23:53] being filled with the Holy Ghost. It's
[23:55] just one thing to believe. But then on
[23:57] the other hand, if you come and you say,
[23:59] "Well, if all it takes is for one thing
[24:01] for me to disbelieve, when you come with
[24:04] a critical eye, you're going to get what
[24:07] you expect. There's there's a lot of
[24:09] things that you can you a lot of things
[24:11] maybe that we don't understand and a lot
[24:14] of things maybe that aren't made plain."
[24:17] But I tell you what, when the spirit of
[24:18] the supernatural God comes on the scene,
[24:21] it makes everything plain. Why? Why does
[24:23] it make it plain? Because now you're not
[24:25] looking with an the eye of a critic.
[24:28] You're looking saying, "Well, I don't
[24:31] maybe I don't understand everything, but
[24:34] I know that this message is true. I know
[24:37] that this word is true because I met a
[24:40] living God." And you know when God comes
[24:43] on the scene that when he came on the
[24:46] scene on the day of Pentecost, he made
[24:48] everything fit together. That's why
[24:50] brother was saying in that message we
[24:52] just heard that without Christ you
[24:54] cannot understand. It's just a mystery.
[24:57] It's just a it's something cryptic,
[24:59] something mysterious. But the spirit of
[25:01] God gives you understanding.
[25:07] Now here's some of the
[25:09] answers. The Romans were experts in
[25:11] execution. They knew dead when they saw
[25:13] it.
[25:15] They knew how to kill
[25:17] somebody. And it wasn't a hallucination
[25:19] because hallucinations are individual,
[25:21] not group
[25:22] experiences. Jesus appeared to groups of
[25:25] people. You can read over there in first
[25:27] Corinthians later on where we're getting
[25:29] to where where there's a chapter where
[25:31] Paul lays out all these incidents where
[25:34] Jesus appeared to people, a group of 500
[25:38] to Cphus to different
[25:40] ones. And the tomb was known. Joseph of
[25:43] Arya as if Jesus were still inside
[25:46] producing the body would have crushed
[25:48] Christianity tonight
[25:51] overnight. But Jesus said he would rise
[25:55] again. You know, many of the witnesses
[25:57] were skeptical at first. They didn't
[26:00] have anything to gain, only persecution,
[26:02] poverty, and death. Their willingness to
[26:06] suffer and die for their testimony is
[26:08] evidence that what they believed that
[26:10] they believed that it was
[26:13] true. And you think about what happened
[26:16] uh when Jesus died on in John chapter 2
[26:19] 18 to 19. He said then answered the Jews
[26:21] and said unto him, "What sign showest
[26:23] thou unto us, seeing that thou doest
[26:25] these things?" And Jesus answered and
[26:28] said unto them, "Destroy this temple,
[26:30] and in three days I will raise it up."
[26:34] All Thursday night they beat him. Friday
[26:37] morning he was crucified. Somewhere
[26:40] between 6:00 and 9:00
[26:42] uh at 9:00 crucified and then and then
[26:45] died at 300 p.m. in the
[26:49] afternoon. I'm skipping through some of
[26:51] my notes here.
[26:54] And you know, the resurrection proved
[26:56] that Jesus was true, that Jesus was
[26:58] real, and he's still the same today,
[27:01] that he always was. And my redeemer
[27:04] liveth, and we'll stop on this quote. He
[27:06] said, "And today, after theologians has
[27:08] tampered with the Bible, after church,
[27:11] church organizations has set up and they
[27:14] say, well, this is what we need." Some
[27:16] people buried under the church, some of
[27:18] the saints, we'll dig up their bones and
[27:20] bring them here. Some of them said,
[27:21] "We'll build a church up over the tomb
[27:23] where he was crucified or where he was
[27:25] buried. We'll build a church there."
[27:26] People in material are trying to do
[27:29] materialistic things, but it's such a
[27:32] naught. There's nothing to it. It's all
[27:34] nonsense and nothing to it. But the real
[27:38] resurrection is those who've died with
[27:41] him and been born again that has that
[27:45] know faith. I know my redeemer liveth.
[27:49] And God's working with those people with
[27:51] signs and wonders and the great
[27:54] commission here showing that he rose
[27:57] from the dead and showing visible signs
[28:01] and wonders. Visible signs and wonders.
[28:04] And I want to say as a musicians come
[28:05] forward that God is still the same
[28:07] miracle working God that he always was.
[28:09] We've heard the story of the testimony
[28:11] of Ron Spencer that that just testified
[28:13] that his cancer is gone. Amen. My wife
[28:15] and I were talking in the car about the
[28:17] sister, a sister we knew that we had met
[28:19] in Louisiana that showed us the picture
[28:20] of the before and after before the the
[28:24] uh she had been diagnosed of cancer in
[28:26] her lungs after God got a hold of the
[28:29] situation. She had the the MRI, the
[28:31] X-rays, everything showed that the
[28:33] cancer was completely gone from her
[28:35] lungs. Miracle after miracle after sign
[28:39] some you'd say, "Well, where are all the
[28:41] miracles?" The miracles are are right
[28:43] here. If you look around, you can see
[28:44] lives being changed. That there's still
[28:47] the a resurrected God working in the
[28:50] lives of people. He's still the same
[28:53] yesterday, today, and forever. That's
[28:55] what I believe. Saints, God bless you.
[28:57] [Applause]
