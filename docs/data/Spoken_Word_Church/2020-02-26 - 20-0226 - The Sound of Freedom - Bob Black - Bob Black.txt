========================================

yeah I'll just pray for me a little bit I'm still a bit stopped up from listen let's go ahead and turn over the eggs for this chapter and this is Lois familiar scripture to us I know and then we're also going a little bit ACCA's chapter 25 let's just give it a look well God we're so grateful to you to be able to gather around your word once more or than we pray Lord that we would come expecting Lord that tonight will not be in vain Lord that you'll come and liver us and heal us and Lord deliver us from the many things that afflict us Lord Jesus deliver us from ourselves Lord and I pray God it tonight you'll give your people a little bit of something extra Lord Jesus that might carry the bone or Jesus that will give them shrimp in order to give us all Lord something Lord Lord in this middle of the week now we're gonna pray Lord at you as we open up the doors of our heart Lord Jesus are ready to receive our God I pray Lord that you'll feel invited Lord God and come among us Lord Jesus we ask these things in your name amen Exodus chapter 21 verses 1 to 7 and it says now these are the judgments which thou shall set before them we come out of come out of Egypt and now God is kind of setting some things in order about how they should their Israelites are supposed to behave if they'll buy and the Hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing and I've got that colored so you can see with the most and that kind of the critical poise if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married than his wife so go out with him if his master have given him a wife and she have borne him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will go out free then his master shall bring him under the judges he shall also bring him to the door or under under the doorpost and his master shall board his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him forever then let's go over the Leviticus chapter 25 verses 8 to 10 and it says and thou shalt number seven Sabbath's of years under these seven times seven years and the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be under the forty and nine years it then shout they'll cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family you may be seated in the presence of the Lord now you know sometimes when you come into the house the Lord the minister preached something real scalding and real hurtful and things and things to kind of mold you and everything but deny I believe I want to take for a topic the sound of freedom because I believe that that the message tonight will look I want to build everybody up and cause you to realize maybe the day in the hour that we're living in and calls you to realize that there's something that God has given to us to cause us to escape the bondage of this world and to escape the bondage of living in sin the bondage of corruption the bondage of having a corrupt mind and you know uh this the first Scripture we read in Exodus chapter 21 was it was it was written to a people that had just come out of Egypt they had been down in bondage for forty years they come out in it they had lived through some things and they had lived through people cracking whips and telling them which way they should go and what they should do and causing them just to rise up in a particular hour and go to bed at a particular hour and just having total control over their life and you know you look around today and maybe guys on the streets as you go to work and all in your car and you look around at people honking at one another and people are living in bondage without realizing that they're in bondage the Egyptians knew that they were in bondage but so many people don't realize today that they are in bondage because the devil has pulled the wool over their eyes it calls them to not realize the state that they're in but maybe tonight many of you here sitting tonight could be in bondage could be in a state of bondage could be could be crippled and and not realizing what your life is for what you're doing here what what your what what the whole plan and purpose of just living is and and you know what that puts you in a state of bondage but there is a there is a deliverance from that I wanted to clear to you tonight that God has made a way for you to be delivered so that's when I when I speak on the sound of freedom I believe that there is a sound that can go out to declare your freedom but then when you receive that freedom then you become the living embodiment of that sound you become the voice of that sound and that's what I want to declare tonight brother Branham said in all the days of our life go ahead and pull that cord up I'm gonna try not to get leaky tonight because I'm just - I'm still on the man say y'all pray for me and brother branham said that all the days of our life he said now we hear so much today about we are free oh we live in a beautiful America we are free all the air is full of it books you're wrote of it thousands of them but you are a million miles for being free you're not free don't you be to see by that is America America is one of the greatest deceived nations and in more bondage than any place I know of you think about what a contradiction that is that in the place where they say that this is the most freedom resides the most the most amount of bondage the people that are most at most in bondage by watching television they can't hardly get away from the television they can't hardly get away from radio in the car they're so in so much bondage to the music that they listen to that they can't I can't help but a lot I just love music so much if they were you know I remember when I was in school you'd ask that the teacher would ask what was one thing that you could do couldn't do without I couldn't do without listen to the music I couldn't listen do without all this rock and roll because they're in bondage to that it's got a hold on their life and people think people think that they're that they're in Liberty because they're able to dress whatever way they want to and they were able to talk but they're able to curse and do all these different kind of things but they're in bondage to the devil listen listen living in sin and living in the world is not Liberty that's not freedom that's not being able to just do whatever you want because you're gonna be in servitude to one thing you're gonna have a master and it's gonna be either the devil or it's gonna be God it's gonna be either Christ there's gonna be Satan you're gonna be you're gonna have and I want to maybe share to you tonight the pleasure and the joy of being in servitude to God it's not it's not a grievous burden it's not something that we're burdens are heaped upon us but it's something delightful to be able to serve the Living God and let me finish reading this quote he said they're worse in bondage than communism could put them in communism can only hurt the body they could only put the body and bondage but when the devil comes in he puts the soul in bondage and man is a slave America is a bunch of slaves you may be a slave to pride you might walk up and down the streets and go through every store and every fashion that you can see on television and go from store to store trying to buy something you become a slave to it you become a slave to your dressing you become a slave to your money that's the only thing that you think of is to make money grab and put it up here if you do that you're a slave you're a slave to it it won't think we think so much we have such liberty to be able to post pictures on Instagram and Facebook on how pretty we are and how how nice we look at post pictures of our shoes and the food that we eat look at this great dessert that that this person has made for me and you can be living in slavery doing all of those wonderful things but still bound to trying to drum up your life and make it look something more delicious than it really is more wonderful make it look like on Facebook that you're living a perfect life with a perfect family went down down in your soul something is something that's cried out here you need something you need to be delivered from bondage the Israelites done in either they had to they had to make bricks without straw all they had to do do whatever that master said they had to arise when he said the taskmasters whip constantly on their back when the devil will tell you everything everyone is happy that you're in prison that even God doesn't love you anymore listen he'll make it he'll put you in prison and make that prison experience that bondage experience so miserable he'll build up a complex in you to make you look around the church maybe or though your family or the people that you associate with and make you think that everybody hates you because of some little little thing and they're you walking around just bound up in bondage you know you begin to think I can't break free of consuming things I shouldn't look to Jesus who already made a way you begin to think I can't break free of looking things of looking at things of consuming things that I shouldn't look at Jesus who already paid the price I can't break free of doubt and worry but look look if you can't break apart break free of all your doubt and worry look at the stripes that he bought for you for our sorrows and for our iniquities you say why why did it want his brother Bob every time it seems like every time he comes up and businesses preach he he begets this hit on these kind of things he don't hit on the things that people living in bondage or whatever I'm trying we're the reason people preach on these kind of things is because because we're trying to bring liberty to you we're not trying to push you down and beat on you but we're trying to bring you to a place where you realize what God has already done for you that he I already paid the price and it's something free do you realize how what a glorious thing the gospel is that you don't have to do one thing for it all you have to do is just open up your heart and believe God you don't you don't have to run a race you don't have to push a penny with your nose you don't have to go up steps on your knees you don't have to do anything all you have to do is receive it it's a free gift to you God can deliver you from the prison house you know what many times with the prison house in our mind is we go through life when we begin to wonder what is our purpose what am I even doing here and I know that's a something that many of the young people deal with in their minds what what am I supposed to do in my life how am I supposed to how am I supposed to provide for my family would it work Who am I gonna marry all these kind of things and you know without the gospel that question can never be answered the question of what is my purpose in life can never be answered without the gospel you can go through life and you've got a job and you'll fall asleep at the table and at night and you'll go to bed and you'll wake up with it and your whole life will just be empty and meaningless said one day you'll go and die and the grave and there'll be a great filled with your body and your whole life will be meaningless without the gospel the gospel is what gives your life meaning and purpose because it identifies what you are here for and what you're living for there is a purpose in your life because because I put it in Bible turns you have an inheritance God gave you an inheritance your inheritance was in him before the foundation of the world and your inheritance is the Word of God your purpose in life is to fulfill the Word of God to be a walking talking manifestation living breathing word of God on the earth to fulfill his words your purpose in life is to be delivered from the world to have a sound mind to know what your purpose and plan is the purpose and plan for your life is the your inheritance is to have healing in your body and peace in time of trouble your inheritance is your inheritance is to have comfort as you walk the valley of the shadow of death the only way that you could have those things that's through the gospel of Jesus Christ you know we sing that that song as the ministers comes out open the eyes of my heart but the eyes of your heart cannot be open to these promise to the inheritance of God if you don't open up the door of your heart and believe it and accept it and say but that is for me I believe it brother in 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 3 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has to be gotten us unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead through it inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and faded that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you that's your inheritance and eret an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not a way that will last forever and ever you have an inheritance and that inheritance is the word of God listen let sweet let's read in the Jubilee year what brother brems said he said today that men and women in our country so our brothers in the back y'all keep up with me as best you can today that men and women in our country and everywhere else has sold herself out to seeing drinking gambling carousing doing things that they ought not to do and become slaves to the devil I met a young lady here not long ago she said brother Branham I'd give anything if I could only break this band of whiskey she said I started when I was a little girl went with a boy that drink we started mixing drinks and I become a perfect slave to it and if I don't have it she says I just go wild if I could only get rid of this I said you can't no here's the key this is the thing that we battle with so many times we think well I'm going to do that I'm gonna save my kids I'm gonna have I can just say that you know word reason with my kids enough then they'll be saved if I can if I can just do it on my own accord I can break the bonds of this alcohol or this drug addiction or whatever it is I can do it on myself but listen what brother Branham said you can't do it yourself but I know someone who can break it for you the Lord Jesus Christ has come to make you free listen we know who can make us free we know how to do it but what you've got to do is you've got to yield yourself to him you've got to allow him to set you free if you don't allow him to set you free then you can't be free but he was scuse me let me I'm trying to quote a scripture that I don't have it in front of me let's keep reading 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9 to 12 it says know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but you are washed but you are sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God listen you Paul Paul's reading through all of this list of all of these things that that that identifies someone that has not heard that Jubilee sound that hurt not heard that that message of freedom and those people if they never hear the gospel of Jesus Christ who cannot inherit the kingdom of God in other words you cannot inherit the kingdom of God if you're in bondage you got to come out of the jailhouse you you've got to first realize that you're in bondage that there's something wrong with your life and I believe that that's what the preaching of the gospel is for to identify that there's something that you need there's something needful in your life that you need to come out of that situation Ephesians chapter 5 verses 3 through 5 says but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh the Saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of things but he's leading all kind of things that maybe would put us under the umbrella of those things foolish talking and jesting just joking about being silly about gotten different kind of things which it's not convey but rather giving of thanks for this she know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God that kind of a person living at that kind of a life without without God on the inside to God their life there have they have no inheritance in other words they have no claim on the Word of God they don't know what their purpose is they don't know what they're doing here they have no inheritance no inheritance but but you I want to declare to you tonight that you have an inheritance under the sound of my voice I'm declaring to you that the Word of God is laying there waiting for you to receive it let me just go through these I think sometimes it's helpful maybe it's just kind of nail down some of these things and I just preach out a little bit Paul was talking about fornicators and adulterers and an unmarried person unmarried people and gays you and one another or married people engaging and doing things that they should not be able to not do idolaters a Dollar Tree is something you know do you know I'm dog 3 hits in places that you might not think of idolatry is to place anything before God and put that before God you can put your TV you can put some kind of game that you playing you can put anything anything that keeps you away from coming to church on Sunday anything in your life you put it you put it before God and becomes an idol to you because this if it's before God then that means you're working with that thing if you place that thing before God then you're placing that thing higher that God in your life and you are working with that thing that's what idolatry is why are we not in church on Sunday we value our own personal activities more than we value serving God we should give everything over to God we should place God before every we should place God before our spouse before our job before everything else because when you play something before God it becomes an IDOT an idol in your life effeminate abusers of themselves with mankind Steve so let me just take this I'm gonna just take this and run and try to take something that don't belong to you covered us a deep desire to possess what belongs to others I really like that car that brothers driving all these kind of things you see when the word of God comes and takes preeminence over a person's life it drives all of that selfish behavior out of you so that you you begin to value somebody else more than you value your own self yeah I was reading a quote that I will have in front of me but brother Branham said the Christian life is to go out and redeem other people that's why when somebody hates you and because to talk spitefully about you and slap you across the face and talk behind your back I read the real Christian love of a real Christian individual want to reach out and redeem that person back to God that's what you know that's what real love is to be able to love somebody that hates you and despises you and it doesn't like you to to walk through it say that boss that hates you at your job and treats you wrong my what kind of a lovely life to be able to want to redeem somebody like that to look down from across and say Father forgive them they know they don't know what they're doing to be like Steven and safe forgive them they don't know what they're doing and to be able to speak those things to people that are stoned and to speak those things to somebody that was crucified on the cross that's a real Christian life brother Brent said let's pull up all the days of our life he said you may be a slave to your religion paragraph 25 you may be a slave to a bunch of Crees and let me tell you a Creed's is nothing but framework for a communism it's the scaffold work that the devil can use to build communism as a cold formal Church for men and women will go to that church and become a slave to their religion become a slave to the devil going into the church and putting your name on the book and putting money into it or either they'll go there and there's nothing said about role tonight I want to speak about Rome there is a wrong and there's a right and you know what you know I did this is my own personal conviction why brother Branham was speaking about communism and this quote is because what communism is is when when Mina believes that we all get together as what just one big of a homogeneous group of society and that everybody gets a little slice of the pie but you know what Christianity is not communism Christianity is an individual walk you don't get to joy it's not a just to join and you just come to church and you show up and you you get to particulars of a slice of the slice of the pie just because you're here in the building but you must enter into Christ as a as a personal individual you yourself come come and walk to that pillar of fire you and God alone that back side of the desert experience there brother Adam talked about where you see God for yourself face to face and you know him because you've seen him better I said I don't like to say this but I'm going to say it anyhow I'm not speaking too hard now I hope I'm not I want to say it with seasoned in it but sisters will go through the air and on the streets here in Chicago it's great just gracefully to see them how they would take their clothes off and walk on the street and they seemingly don't know any different they don't realize that they're committing adultery you say well brother branham I know women that a women cannot wear a woman cannot wear shorts without having an evil spirit owner you get that because you might not believe it and her intellectuals but Satan has put that spirit on her to show herself before men and at the Day of Judgment every man that looks at her in the wrong way will be guilty with her for committing adultery with her on the day of the judgement and her pastor don't say nothing about it you see when when a woman is not dressing right and not clothes right she is in bondage that is a sign that she's in bondage when you when you look at a man on the street and he doesn't look like a real man he's got his hair all down over his eyes he can't even lift it he had to lift it up to see his Bible if he were gonna read the Bible that X shows that there's something wrong with him he's in bondage that man is held in bondage and he needs something to liberate him you see if we if we were to look into the Bible the right way we are all guilty and we all come short and we've all fallen short and we all need something to redeem us we all need something to come and and give us that that that sound of freedom you see the Romans chapter 319 says and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but you can't do it on your own you know Moses tried Moses tried to free the Egyptian on his own end up killing the Israelites on his own end up killing an Egyptian he tried to do it on his own and if you try to do it on you on your own you'll mess up the whole thing you're less you'll mess up the situation and nothing will go right and you'll begin to think that you'll begin to wonder wait what am I doing wrong like like Moses did when he went out into the wilderness and brother Aaron said he began to lose the feeling for the deliverance of the people he began to as friends he wandered in the wilderness for forty years just kind of sitting out there doing herding the Sheep and everything he began to wonder if it was still possible maybe I said like they began to kind of forget about the deliverance of the Israelites and then one day he met the pillar of fire and I believe that's what we all need every one of us sit here tonight we need our own experience with the pillar of fire because the pillar of fire will reveal to you the plan and purpose for your life it will reveal to you the will of God in your life it will reveal to you who Jesus Christ is because that's who that pillar of fire is we need a personal experience with that pillar of fire a backside of the desert experience this brother branham sitting out now we don't go to the backside of the desert like we got to find the desert and go wandering around or anything but we get to a place like Moses did where I need something I've got to find something a desperation and then God will meet you because the Bible says if you'll draw nigh unto me I will draw nigh unto you if you there's something in you draw and been hungry for God then run to him and he'll draw nigh unto you John chapter 8 34 to 35 says Jesus answer then verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin if you commit sin you the servant of sin if your if your living in unbelief you were the servant of a belief and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free and deed which goes on into this scripture that we were reading earlier Exodus chapter 21 one two seven now these are the judgments with the south-south set before them if thou by and the hebrew service six years he shall serve in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing well you see what would happen is it in the Bible and there's a few different instances of different stories in the Bible where there's the one where the little the little lady she got in a situation with dead and they beget the debtors were going to come the people that she owed money to were going to come and take her to her two sons away and then Elijah came on the scene and resolved that situation for but you see what if you if you got into a situation of debt then your children could be so sold off into debt until to pay that price to work until the the price had been paid you see what happened was Adam led when he sinned in the garden sold us all in the debt and all of his children got sold got sold away until the debt was paid but unfortunately that's a debt that we could never pay how can you pay the sin that you cannot you can't pay that debt just like all of these people that like the little widow woman there that I was just telling about how how could she pay that debt how could she pay a debt to get to get out of the obligation that she had to make their only way was if God would come on the scene and make a way for you to be for you to come out of that bondage come out of that situation where the taskmaster is cracking that whip and telling you what time you can rise and what time you can go to sleep and where it go over there and hold a little bit and go over there and trim these hedges and all of those kinds of things the only way that you can get out of that situation if as if God makes a way the God made it wait here in this verse he said six years he shall serving in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing three for another in other words you don't have to do anything to be free there is no price that you have to beat to pay to be free they said I'm an a man working in bondage he would find himself helpless under the power of his master like somebody drinking alcohol under the power that might somebody doing drugs I I can't get away from it how can I get away from it or somebody just living in that Carlos state of sin not understanding that the true nature of life and all of these kind of things but then God made a way and he said you can get out of the pawn shop for free you don't have to you don't have to pay the minister you don't have to thank anybody you don't have to give a speech aren't you glad when you got saved you didn't have to get up and give a speech to a big crowd you don't have to do anything there's no obligation to salvation you don't even have to be a preacher that's preachers that we're not preaching to be saved we're preaching because we love the Lord Jesus and we feel a call in our life and we got something to say and we want to help somebody you don't have to make a donation you don't even have to be a big shot you don't have to dress a certain way you don't have to wear a fancy clothes you don't have to do nothing to be to be safe you don't have to thank God for this you don't have to know a lot you could be a whole ignorant fisherman like Peter and just just like come out come out and out of the fishing boat can't even read or write and just hear the preaching of the gospel and all of a sudden that ignite in his heart and he's he's telling everybody how to climb the Statue for perfect baby you don't have to know anything all you have to know is Jesus Christ and him crucified that's all you have to know you don't have to listen there is it is free for nothing you can come out free for nothing and it says if his master I've given him a wife and she had borne him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself so there's still restrictions can't everybody can't come out yet there's still restriction you know I think a lot of times a lot of times preachers will kind of hold back a little bit but tonight I just want to share exactly what I believe about these kind of scriptures so you could either say well I agree with that or I don't agree with it I believe that the reason that they couldn't come out it's because that's typing something that's of this present day it's type of something that happened down through the seven churches as the people in each age received the baptism of the Holy Ghost there they could come out in their soul as their soul receiving attention and their soul was able to come out to receive their full inheritance but yet their spirit their body but still it could not come out yet something was still left waiting you see something hang it on and so that's that's maybe were you I give you a little glimpse into where I'm going tonight with with this little little message but Paul if you could kind of imagine what as that seventh year approach that people would begin to talk amongst themselves the seventh years coming up when the seventh year comes we're gonna be able to go out we're gonna we're gonna be able to leave we're gonna be able to you know as long as you're willing to leave the fact the wife that you married while you were in bondage the children that you had weren't while you were in bondage as long as you were able to leave all that behind or if you were alone if you're during that time as long as you're able then you can leave and all these things I imagine that kind of a message that began to be shared is similar to the message that was proclaimed in Isaiah 53 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows in other words the price has already been paid it's not something that we've done but it's something that he has done it's something that carried over all the way from from an exodus when they put that blood over the little of their door and they killed a lamb because the price had been paid the blood it was shown on the little of their door he had already done the work surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed and we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord has laid him they on the iniquity of us all on their nikka the only him the iniquity of us all that's the kind of message I believe that will bring us out of bondage to look to him to look to the price that Jesus paid listen this is the best deal that there's been in 2,000 years if I was a if I was a car salesman or something I couldn't make a better sale this is a sale that you don't have to do nothing for you because you imagine going through the car lot and saying I want to buy a car and they say well just come and come and take a car oh you don't have to pay anything for it this is the best deal that there is because you don't have to do anything you don't have to you don't have to pay any money you don't have to work for it it's just freely available in Romans chapter 3 verse 20 Paul said but now the righteousness of God without the law was manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified how freely freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus and the 1st Corinthians chapter 2 Paul said for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely freely given to us of God and it Romans chapter 5 verse 18 therefore as the as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life why do i why don't I kind of integrate over these scriptures because I want to drive home the point that it's free to you it's a free gift it's free it's freely available available you're justified it's justified freely it's that are free these things are given freely given to us of God but you know what and that seventh year that free gift was only available to sons the house that game under dead and and and the person that owned that house wouldn't have to give that house over to whoever they owe the long gotta loan the money or whatever for and within that house were sons but with also also within that house were service and the sons and the service would all go out into bondage while they were in bondage they would work together and you couldn't tell a son apart from a server they were all working in the field together and you didn't know who was who because they were working side by side they all had a hole in their hand and they were all working in the field together but when that seventh year came the son got to go out but the servant remain in bondage the serve the son begat to go home back to their inheritance and you see when you hear this gospel proclaimed because your sons that he said in spirit in your heart crying I'm a father he was your son's before the foundation in the world because God knew and he knew that you would receive it he had it waiting for you you were predestinated to hear it you were predestined to know it by foreknowledge he knew that she would receive it and so because he knew it he had an inheritance waiting for you and when you hear the gospel proclaiming that proclaiming your Liberty you can return back to that inheritance back to the eternal word that was there before the foundation of the world that gave that word is imparted to you listen to the youth it's the son only sons can go back only sons and therefore you must be born again just because you join a church or you come to church or you pay your tithes or all those things does not entitle you to this inheritance just because your mama and your daddy to believe the message of us because just because the people that you're associated with believe it and they're good people that does not entitle you to that inheritance brother I'm told that story about this a sister to said I burn a candle every night and he said what's that got to do with Christianity well what's God being a good person got to do with being a girl with Christianity we you to be born again you know so many people conflate being born again with with it with being an American we pull up put a flag behind us and that somehow entitles us to be to Christianity or to say I'm a Christian or if we go to we go to Dollywood for a vacation and we go to the little singin's and things and listen to the songs and Christian songs and all that that has nothing to do with being born again you must be born again and you must receive the word and your into your soul open up the channel of your heart so that God Himself can come in and make himself alive to you Bela I'm said in the message Jubilee year he said I remember myself oh my when I heard that good news coming to my heart as a little old sinner boy laying in on the hospital bed the doctor says you got three more minutes to live I heard a sound from heaven that told me Jubilee Jubilee year was old I accepted the Lord Jesus turn loose all the shackles of sin and said to the devil you can't do me any more harm because I've give my life to Christ Jesus and you can't whip me anymore since then he's bluffed me lots of times but he's not been able to touch me since because he's just a bluff I can hear his whip cracking and popping and so forth but it don't do no good because he can't get me because I belong to the Lord now that's right listen when you give your soul to the Lord and God verse gives you a word birth that's something that word down in your soul as something that the gates of Hell cannot prevail against the devil can't touch that down in your soul we skip over some of these just to kind of keep moving my brother around said in the mark of the beast and the seal of God he said let me give you a little scripture here just for a minute I want you to turn with me to Exodus so you don't have to just mark it down Exodus 21 6 if a slave had been sold out and there come the year of Jubilee the year of Jubilee the Jubilee priest sounded the trumpet how many knows that the trumpet was the trumpet and he sounded it and when he did every slaves could go by free to his home if he was out in the field chopping with a hoe and somebody I lost my place somebody over here whipping him with a whip and here what was that what was that gospel troupe it sounding the good news throw that hoe down and turn a ride around and say you have no more rule over me going home to my wife and kids I was sold over here in slavery but you hear that trumpet sounding that means that I'm a Hebrew I have a right I'm a birthright and man I have a right I can go free without anybody's money not if you'll do this so you do that see the whole thing was grace not if you will but if you'll hear the trumpet the jubilee year the Lord preached the acceptable year the Jubilee year how we could but I'm watching that guy he said see hearing faith cometh by for what hearing now not not just listen with your ear but if you hear that means you understand it accept it see what hearing means he that believeth and hears my words that to hear to understand when you when you sit in a church and you begin to understand the preaching of the gospel and against the sink down then you're accepting something real I hear you I believe it he says see is hearing let's skip on down but you can come to Christ and be sealed by the Holy Ghost you can take your choice now watch you hear the gospel Trump what is the gospel trumpet the good news the Holy Ghost is here how do you know it how do you know it is watch it work see what it does it's the good news the good news is the sound of freedom that you can go free that you can come up and rise out of bondage that you can throw your hoe down but you got a choice whether to throw that hole down whether to keep it in your head and keep working and that's why it says in Exodus chapter 121 if the service shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him under the judges he shall also bring him to the door under the doorpost and his mastership bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him forever and I know many a you know we're all acquainted with what that and everything but I just want to take a little liberty tonight just just kind of break this down because you see the Bible says that faith comes by hearing the word and so when that when that that Gospel message goes out that you can be free and you say well you know what I'd rather just keep the ho in my hand and you and and it's like he's really like a proposal the the the bridegroom keeps coming and saying well will you be mine will you be mine and the little lady says I but you know I'm just not right now not now I'm sorry maybe come back in a year and I'll give you my answer then and it comes back you know that's how patient God is with us we come to revival meetings and we come to go to camps and all of those things and we hear the minister's preaching hard and won't you come won't you come once you give your life to him and you just see you sit there and you say well I'd I'd rather just keep the hole in my hand I'd rather keep hoeing in bondage I prefer bondage overcoming free and after a while and your heart begins to be seared as the Bible says it's like a hot iron there's like an iron being applied to your soul until your soul just can't respond anymore it doesn't it doesn't hear anymore and after a while like like that story that brother and I'm told of that that girl that she said well I remember when you told me I needed to be saved but now after a while it got to where I could look at my old mama roasted in hell and I'd laugh at it because you imagine having a heart a heart that had been so hard and why was it hardened like that because she said I'd rather keep holing I'd rather stay in bondage I'd rather keep the hole in my hand then turn loose and accept the gospel of liberation I'd rather keep holing than listen to the sound of freedom and after a while her heart just got so hard brother Branham said hey and if it said that message Joe in the message job he said I told her young lady I believe God's calling you nice sister she said if I want somebody to talk to me I don't want somebody that's got more sense about it but my can you believe that and I said well sister I can only say the Holy Spirit is telling me she said I don't want to hear that no more that's the same thing as saying I'd rather keep hoeing then then accept what you got to say a year later I passed through that city and that girl had become a prostitute her clothes hanging low owner offered me a drink of whiskey and she said and I shamed her and she said you know what preacher you remember the night you told me I ought to be saved I said yes I do she said that was the truth said I've crossed the separating line there I grieved God from my heart the last time said here's the remark that girl made said I could see my mother's soul fry and hill like a pancake and laugh at it hard hearted and in the Old Testament what they would do when somebody was unwilling to let go that hole was they would take their take their ear to that post but they rear up to that post and I believe it was the post where they had once put that lambs blood over it but where they were that they had escaped out of out of out of out of bondage and Israel a sign that she was rejecting the Lambs blood rejecting the price that Jesus paid that person was rejecting that and they would nail that all put that all through the year they are they are the ear that would never again could never again be touched by the God the preaching of the gospel because it had been seared over listen I think a lot of times we think we think sometimes that that Christian burden is it's gonna be more heavier heavier than than just staying in bondage and living under the weight of the devil and all this guy yeah I was remember reading in Paul John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress about early on in the beginning of that book the pilgrim is walking around and he's got a big old cycle on his back and he's weighted down by the law it's got he's got like a big old burden and you know that that's many times that's what people think that Christian life is this that you walk around with a big old burden on your head on your back and you're you're trying to do although all these do's and don'ts and you're trying to live right and trying to do right listen to Christian burden is not Grievous because that's Christ living his life outward through you and you don't have to do anything except yield to him and believe his word and just keep eating a sheep don't have to do anything to bear wool all it does is keep eating it out from that the body of that sheet comes wool I know this is maybe I'm heading on some things that we're all very familiar with but try to stick some toothpicks in your eyes and stay awake just a little bit longer hang on with me now the Christian burden is not Grievous because Jesus said he said coming to me all you that labor it are heavy laden and I will give you rest if you've got a big old heavy burden come to me and and I'll carry it for you I'll be the burden bearer I'll carry all your burdens he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest in your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light my yoke is easy you know you know what that means when you yoke up two oxen and they're both usually usually the way it works is they're both pulling with the same amount of load but this kind of yoke is different because Jesus is the one doing all the work and you're just yoked up to him you're walking along with him but he's the burden bearer he's the one that's he's the one that's living the life he's the one that takes care of your body when you kneel and he's the one that takes care of the salvation of your children what you think all hope is gone he's the one that's going to that's going to bring us to a body change I couldn't live in our own selves take us to a body change but he's the one that's bearing the burden the first Peter it says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you but what a great blessing that we have access to to be able to cast all of our cares all of our worries when we were and Fred and more great air sprout as we get older and and all those kind of things that we're fretting about whether our kids are gonna get home safely at night and whether we're gonna they're gonna be able to do this and that and all these kind of things can the Bible says all that on him cast all your burdens on him why because the Christian burden has not Grievous it's a light load we should be able to walk with a spring and a stand our step and a song in our heart because Jesus has taken we're walking with him he's carrying a parent all the yoke were yoked up with him he's the one Matthew chapter 23 I want to hit this real quick Matthew chapter 23 or for says for they bond jesus was talking about the Pharisees and the Sadducees for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers and that's what many ministers do that's what many people in the message do they make the message something that's a grievous burden but it's a it's a light thing to be borne if it's a heavy burden maybe you're the one that's carrying all the weight but give it over to Jesus and let him bear the burden and see what happens listen Jesus has made a way God has made a way for us to escape when I was thinking about McDaniel down there in Babylonian captivity where they were having - just like the Egyptians they were they were living in a situation that they did not have control over outside of their inheritance and Daniel began to look into the books of Jeremiah I began to be reminded of the fact that now they were about to be released from their bondage that now something was about to happen to allow them to return back to their inheritance and and out after 70 years they did all of these things begin to rapidly unfold and before long the people were back in there and aired us and we read all these things about the prophecies of Daniel how they in 49 years for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and then 434 years - most sixty-two weeks - Messiah the Prince and then Messiah the Prince came on the scene suddenly and and he went into the temple and preached these words that tie in to the scripture that I read earlier that I was talking about the year the city after seven years seven times seven something is going to he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me and I was a chapter 61 because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings under the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and we know by the preaching of the word of the message that that acceptable the year of the Lord is that Jubilee year the Jubilee year that yet of which you can go free let me let me talk a little slower so you can understand me you see they're all down through scripture the Jubilee had been identified as the blowing of that chauffeur that when they when the chauffeur was blown in the 49th year that they could go free but now Jesus says he stood there in the temple identified it not with the blowing of a horn but with the preaching of the gospel and with the preaching of the gospel the people would be liberated to proclaim Liberty to the captives to the people that were in bondage that you could go free so the opening of the prisoner then that are bound to open the dopant up the prison door so that the people could go free and you see if the people would receive Jesus's message it would have been a golden a golden age to them if they would have not rejected that capstone ministry it would have been a golden age just like it was when Solomon shared his wisdom with the people that would have had a golden age but but they rejected that message and so something will something because something was waiting until the end time skip skip over some of these things let's read Leviticus chapter 25 8 to 10 this is a now shalt number seven seven of years under these seven times seven years in the space of the seventh Sabbath's of years shall be under the forty and nine years then shalt thou call the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement sure you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and usually return every man unto his possession and he shall return every man unto his family so you see if I could just put this into a little illustrative story down down through the seven churches after the baptism at all ago spell at Pentecost the people began to that every seven years say you say let's say ever so many years of revival would break forth and people would come to meetings and they would they would they would be they would they would be released from their bondage every seven years we'll say like every seven years that Paul would begin to preach his ministry and then Iranians would preach his ministry and Martin would preach it under those ministries people were to hear that message of liberation and they would go free but yet they couldn't go free completely just like in the Old Testament how your your family if you got married your family if he found it got a wife and you had children when you were in bondage those people come and come out and so now now even though they've got the new birth even though they're marching marching and out of bondage in their soul yet they couldn't come all the way out but then down at the end of time after the seven seven seven seven times seven is forty-nine then a trumpet is supposed to be sound sounded the trumpet is supposed to sound that will give you liberation you see we there's more to there's more to the Christian story than just being born again there's more to this than that there's more to Liberty than just deliverance from drinking and smoking and gambling there's more to this story than just being born again and living a good Christian life in the church we're marching toward complete deliverance complete restoration full Redemption so that we can fully return back to the inheritance that was lost in the Garden of Eden and you see hearing that trumpet hearing that trumpet sound hearing that gospel trumpet preached is the only requirement for your Liberty when that gospel TripIt in the Old Testament sounded you didn't have to be there to see the daaad but you didn't even have to be there to see this the person blowing the trumpet all you had to do was hear that trumpet hear that message proclaimed announcing that your bondage was over that you could go free and then you drop your hoe and say I receive it I believe it but you got to drop your hoe maybe I should have titled that just something tonight you got to drop your hose because that's that's the whole that whole point of this you got to drop your you got to drop your hold her to be born again you got to drop your hoe to go up the statue of a perfect man and you got to drop your hoe to go into the capstone revelation because that is that is what the shout of freedom in the shout of freedom as the voice of the seven thunders they opens the seven open seals that declare your liberation they speak out that you are free that is the shout of freedom to you you see many communities many tonight maybe I've escaped the bondage of the world and our souls have been sealed in by the new birth but in our spirit Satan has us in bondage by will say a disease of the Spirit maybe tonight you could hear born-again sitting here and sealed in and your and down in your soul but in your spirit you're still thinking well I don't know if I'm good enough I wonder if I'm really born again like sister Sheppard I wonder it because yeah as you eat the word I begins to open up to you and it begins to or you're the real place that you're in and and the place of the message and all of these things begin to put up you yeah you begin to wonder because in your spirit you're you're wondering things I don't know if I can take a body change I don't know if the Lord really wants to heal me you know brother Brent said we can barely have faith for a toothache how are we gonna have faith for a rapture but you see you can be born again and not quite have faith for a toothache but you've got to be born again and have faith for a rapture you've got to get rid of that disease of the Spirit and the way to get rid of that disease of the Spirit is by listening to that Jubilee trumpet that's been sounded us that's the purpose of the Jubilee trumpet and by the Jubilee trumpet I'm talking about the message of the hour that we've heard the purpose of the message of the hour is to give us rapturing faith to give us faith to know that you have escaped bondage that you've come out of the things in this world that you've climbed it for stature a perfect man that your memories and consciousness affection imagination have not been done away with but have been so lined up that the flues are opened up that God can work through a perfect channel in your life that when you reason its reasoning upon the Word of God its reasoning by the Word of God not reasoning where you're questioning and everything but you know that His Word it's true your flus are cleared up then you've got the sound of freedom you heard the sound of freedom the sound of your liberation and you know that you've been set free you see that's what that's what brother Dale has been preaching on it and brother Wade about Hebrews 11 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received and received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect he's provided something better for us something better Jubilee message the sound of freedom to identify to you that not only your soul can return back to your inheritance but your spirit and your body can go back your spirit and your body can be completely redeemed the message of fully different full Redemption you see how why even in the scripture how it says on the tenth day of the seventh month do you do you know I believe that that's identifying the message that we've heard with its placement in the scripture that is spoken of in Revelation chapter ten verses seven eight but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound that is that jubilee message that we've heard the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his service to prophecy the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me now here's the part that everybody doesn't like here's the part it goes from the from the prophets speaking a message of freedom to you taking that message of freedom and receiving it and eating it so that you become the message of freedom you become that Jubilee message and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standing upon the sea and upon the earth dude do you realize the identification with that voice and this age when let me go find that scripture when Jesus was talking to Peter he said I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven how would he bind and loose by the word that by the revelation of the word that he had would be able to loose or bind do you know when when Jesus called Lazarus out of the grave he said loosed him after Lazarus came out he said loosed him because he was bound and now this gospel and when you receive the voice it gives you power to loose or to bind because you have a revelation of how things work you have a revelation of how the word operates and you're able by the preaching of the gospel to loose people from bondage to loose people from their sins because when you the word goes forth and they receive it they are loosed from the bondage that they are in that's the power of the gospel the power of the gospel is to loose people from their bondage it is literally the sound of freedom the sound of freedom you know what the sound of freedom is the sound of freedom is that you were in him before the foundation of the world because now we have an understanding of Genesis 1:26 27 that sound the freedom was that there was a mystery in the back part of God's mind and you were the mystery the sound of freedom is the seven thunders declaring your complete Redemption and the sound of freedom is that you are no longer you're no longer under Satan's Dominion because same good look at a real true born again adopted son of God and he don't know what to do with that person because circling like a vulture circling around food and but he just can't figure out how to get into that person that's fortified behind the Word of God in a way that Adam stepped out from let me skip through some of these in Revelation tier nine to eleven he says I went unto the angel at seventy him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in that mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was at my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and I know that's been preached many times but I just want to reiterate again but you've got to receive that voice and when you receive that voice you become that voice and you are able to speak it that's the thing that the position that God is trying to bring us to he's trying to bring us to a place a place from hearing faith - speaking faith a place where you have heard that voice - a place where now you can speak that voice you can speak that word you know maybe just says yeah I think it's so odd that one of the one of the examples of the three pools and brother branham's and ministry was anything when he went over to Hattie Wright's house and you know the story goes that she was she was she was living off a little $200 a year income and she had given 40 bucks I think was to the building fund and and brother never would have given 20 bucks to her to kind of give it back to her brother Branham went over there with 20 dollars in his pocket he was going to give that to her and the Lord spoke to him and said don't give her twenty dollars I got something for him here the tail of that story of the squirrels and she said she said listen I believe that had a ride in that position in that moment she was typing the bride because she was receiving the word just like you and I ever sees that word and then out of her mouth she said she said that's nothing but the truth you see how simple dropping that hoe is when you receive the gospel you drop that hoe from your bondage and he said what did he tell her he said whatever you say you can have but you see because the voice of freedom that child of freedom I've been putting any right she got to say whatever you say whatever you want and in that hour she had a perfect desire she didn't what money she didn't want wealthy fame all she wanted it was to deliver and stuff her children and I believe tonight that if you want deliverance of your children it's not really up beyond the reach of God it might be beyond your reach it might be up beyond the things that you can do it you're all moral capabilities but it's not beyond his reach speaking like Hany right that's that's what God is trying to bring this to he's trying to bring us to a place where you receive the word but now you can't speak it you can speak it not speaking your own desires but speaking like how do you ride ahead that was God's desire God's desire is the salvation of your family God's desire is the salvation of his whole church God's desires to bring you to a place of adoption a place where you know that God's Word is true and all that disease of your spirit has been baked out by the word and you have complete confidence in him that you know who he is and you know who you are and you know the day and the hour that you're living in and you believe you believe it that's that's accepting the shout of freedom you just believe God and you take him and you accept him at his word there's a music awaiting come over by the way I'm said in the Laodicean Church age you said Oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride I believe that voice is in the bride and I there's a people that have received the message of the hour that have heard that Jubilee trumpet that have received that have never looked into that open book and have taken it from the angel and eating it and received it and they have become that voice they are the voice walking on two feet able to speak the word because they know the word and tonight if you don't know what I'm talking about I implore you I encourage you to just let go that hope just open your hand Oh to free that grasp on that whole would just just let that whole drop so that God so that you can accept deliverance from the bondage that you're in let's stand to our feet and just praise the Lord a little bit 596 in the spiral I feel the pool at night I lay in bed and I began to cry and my Changez fails to know exactly why can explain [Music] must be gun
