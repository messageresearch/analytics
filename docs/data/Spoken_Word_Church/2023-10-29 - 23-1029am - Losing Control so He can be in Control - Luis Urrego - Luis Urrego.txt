========================================

as we are Lord and we just ask you father that we just first of all just thank you Lord for for the another opportunity to serve you Lord father we just pray Lord that you'd have your way in this Sunday school lesson and and speak to our hearts Lord and you be our uh you be our portion this morning Lord we we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen's try this again all right all right so so we want to talk this morning about losing control so he can be in control all right because sometimes we go into freak uh control freak mode and we think that we have to have our hands on in everything and and what you're doing really is you're doing wrong you end up messing up stuff is really what you're doing but let's let's let's look at Sarah and Abraham's uh uh impatience uh and it's interesting that brother Brandon was just talking about that in what we were just listening to that God had given Abraham in in in Genesis chapter 5 of I'm sorry about Genesis 6 I meant 16 uh Genesis chapter 15 God had clearly given Abraham the um the promise that he was going to have a son and he gave him everything he even he even Vindicated that to him and then yet uh he goes and tells his wife and uh you know time passes and and uh uh Here Comes Sarah she gets impatient she thinks that she's got to make it happen some way somehow and you know the mess that it that it got in so so just real quick just just to read the word it says now Sarah Abra Abram's wife be him no children and and he had an an handmade an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and so so he she looked at Hagar there's my solution right there instead of waiting for God Amen that's what we do we here's our solution anything that's convenient to go ahead and grab that's right in front of us there that's our solution right there and then that's that's that's our our control freak uh uh you know that we have in us that we got to just make everything and and in reality when you when you do that and you don't delegate things properly you end up a you end up in a and mess yourself you see and you end up also doing others a disservice because they don't learn how to be responsible themselves as well you see when you try to take control of everything yourself amen so and Sarah said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath restrained from bearing I pray so she brings in the problem I pray thee go in unto my maid so she brings in the solution she thinks my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her so she's interpreting now what what she thinks God was trying to tell her tell him and that's when we get in trouble amen when we try to bring in our own interpretation on things and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah and Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar her maiden the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to to to her husband Abram to be his wife and he went in unto a Hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes so she conceives there's the solution right there that's exactly what God wanted but then when she conceives the Bible says her mistress was despised In Her Eyes in other words hear started looking at at at at Sarah like see I got a child and you don't I was able to conceive and now you don't and so that then becomes a problem in Sarah's eyes and Sarah said unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee now she's blaming it on on on Abraham her decision that she made you know trying to control things now she's putting the blame on on on Abraham so you were the one who did it but she was the one who said to said to do it right Abraham was just doing what she you know like you know some some of us husbands you know we we do just make sure that there's peace in the [Laughter] house you know just for the sake of Peace so that she can realize okay she was in the wrong amen that's what we do things sometimes but then sometimes you know you have to put your foot down amen cuz you are the head of the house but there is a place where God told Abraham hearken to your wife Sarah right right so Sarah wasn't always wrong in everything man sometimes us husbands we think that we got to you do it my way or else and that's not how it goes so the Bible says that she is your help meet and other words she can give input as well she has almost just as much wisdom as as we do husbands sometimes because they can put their hands in multiple things where we are only created us men to just concentrate on one thing at a time I'm certainly that way I can't do multiple things at one time I'm sitting there driving and my wife's talking to me but I'm thinking about Sunday school lesson this morning and and she's like you you didn't hear what I said or I'll respond to what she said you know about two minutes later are you just now processing what I just said two minutes ago and that's just how we uh us men are we can't tackle but one thing at a time but see that's the thing God made us that way and so we have to accept the fact that you are going to frustrate yourself trying to make everything happen all at one time when in reality you were not made that way right all right else we can't do that because you're going to frustrate yourself and then in the fact that you're frustrating yourself you're going to end up frustrating others around you because they see you frustrated and they see you upset right oo it's going getting down a little down to the home level this morning huh but that's good and Sarah said unto AB my wrong be upon thee I gave I have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the lord judge between me and thee but Abraham said unto Sarah behold I made is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when Sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face so that's what it caused her her her her wanting to take control of the situation that's what it end up causing it it it it it it caused a a a a stress in that in that relationship where she had to end up being hard on on on on Hagar and end up sending her away and and many times it happens like that to us when you think you have control of everything but in reality in your control freak mode that you're in and I know that sounds a bit harsh but that's what we are sometimes we're Control Freaks and we think that if it's not done our way then it can't be done in it's my way or the highway and that's not how it works that's not how it works amen so I like this right here because if you think about it this way it as I as I have written here it says the more you fear about losing control the more you want to be in control and the more you are in control the more you fear about losing control so it's a NeverEnding cycle and you see people who who have that mentality about wanting to control everything and about wanting to just take control it's my way or no way they don't know that they're that way just like the gossiper doesn't know that he's a gossiper or that or that or that the liar doesn't know that he or she is a liar they think it's just okay that's just the way I roll but in reality you're hurting others around you with your control freak trying to take control of everything amen you see it's a dangerous cycle that you're going around and around amen because what you think you're controlling is actually controlling you what you think you're controlling is actually controlling you and you don't know it right but other people around you they St they see it and because you're such a control freak they might not say anything to you out of fear but it's hurting you in the long run it's hurting you in the long run look what brother random says here and taking sides with Jesus and I believe that all these things has a time of lingering waiting but it's waiting for a time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets gets right everything in order waiting many many times we get impatient like a child we great get great anticipations and many times jump way ahead and that just hinders the work that just hinders the work until the work gets caught up see we must just move reverently have a purpose in heart that God if he would desire to use us in such and such but wait till he makes the opening cuz he has to go ahead of of us amen we want Jesus Christ to lead us amen we don't want to lead him amen he knows the way he is the head we are the body and the body follows wherever the head goes amen so so so he knows the best for us and and and so you know us as as parents uh I've been there we try to take control of of of of our children in such a way when we think that monitoring everything they do and and and looking at every single Instagram post they have or or who are they talking to and and and we think that that we're are in control and in reality we're hurting them in reality they end up rebelling and then you're you you you you're wondering what just happened you know what just happened they don't want to serve the Lord they don't it's because of your control actions that probably just rubbed them the wrong way and really what teenagers are asking for is they want they want for you to have confidence in them that's right now I know that there's things you know that that you have to definitely put your foot down your your your your teen comes to the house with with weed or or or or or you know or cracked in a bag or something like that you know you got to put your foot down on something is you can't just say well I'll let them sort it out you know no you ain't going to have crack in my house you ain't going to have crack pipes in my house you ain't going to have no you see and if you're going to you the door is right there right cuz this is a home dedicated to the Lord but sometimes we think you know that you know we're looking in every drawer in their in their room and we're looking in everything you know give them uh some leway because in reality that's what ends up making them your friend in in the long run they want to be your friend and they want but they they can only be your friend and have confidence in you if you have some confidence in them right it works both ways and I know some of us we've learned that the hard way I have too but that that that that that is how it works because you know as a a teenager they're becoming adults and what is you as an adult what do you want you want people people to have confidence in you you want people to trust you and not people to be over you controlling you and and and making sure that that that you know that that rubs you the wrong way doesn't it you see so it does the same thing with a teenager so we have to be careful with that amen and in Ecclesiastes chapter 3: 1 through 8 I'm not going to read it all but the Bible says to everything there is a a season is right to everything there is a season there is and a time to every purpose under under Heaven amen a time to be born a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted brother way knows that very clearly you know where he does the garden there's a time to plant but when you plant something you can't rush it there is no way for you to rush it I mean you can maybe put some some nitrogen or some vitamins to the to the soil but but you have to let uh nature take its course and then you will be able to grab and and get what you sowed you will reap what you sow when you let it come out you see when you have patience amen and it's going to produce what it what it says it's going to produce amen all right so you don't always have to have the power uh you don't always have the power to control but you always have the power to surrender all right listen to that you don't have the power to control but you always have the power to surrender because surrendering is an Act of Faith right surrendering is an Act of Faith as I as I have written up there is having faith in what God Said in his word word amen that he's going to take care of what he promised he would so if Sarah would have done that amen when Abraham received the promise and Abraham went to Sarah and said listen God told me this that she should have said like Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word to Thy word and I and I think things would have would have would have would have been different for Sarah and her family right but we know that there was there had to be an ishmail to come forth and and all that so God fulfills his purpose in many different ways but but if if we were just do that amen that that uh be it unto me according to Thy word Lord amen that is an Act of Faith Mary Mary at the age that she was in 15 16 years old amen very in inexperienced in her life uh she just wanted to be married and have a husband just like any everybody else she wanted to you know have a you know nice donkey at parked in the front in the in the in the front you know of the house you know of the you know not not something you know too extravagant you know but you know a nice donkey you know parked right there a little maybe a little Chariot maybe maybe uh she was thinking about all these things and then the angel comes to her and tells her you're going to have a child and it's not going to be by Joseph but God shall overshadow you the holy Holy Spirit Will overshadow you and all she could say was Lord be it unto me according to what you're saying right didn't have to understand it all amen sometimes we don't have to understand it all amen and just release and let God have his way amen praise God Amen see our desire to control what is it rooted in it's rooted in the lack of faith our desire to control is rooted in lack of faith our desire to control people is rooted in the lack of faith in those people but they're supposed to be children of God just like you filled with the Holy Ghost don't you think that God can work through them just as he works through you don't you think that God can steer them amen when if God's in control of the whole thing of the whole matter why can't God you work with with with other people but you see you have to put your your your your your your your thing in it and then that's when that's when the things get messed up and that's when people why are people treat me this way why are people looking at me that way it's because you put your trying to put your own thing into it you see and so that it's because it's a lack of faith it's a lack of faith that that God's program isn't complete unless I do something about it and that's that's that's God God God uh God doesn't like that we do that amen if it's going to be up if it's going to be it's up to me it's what you say I've got to be strong I got to make it happen I got to manipulate it and it doesn't work that way amen I hope those that that still don't have children I hope I hope you listen and take note hey amen it doesn't at the beginning see when you're f with your first child you have uh everything every you know my mom my mom with with me I was her first son I was her first child and she would every I mean anything that I picked up from the floor she would just I mean she wash it you know and wash my mouth and then and and and she would she would uh uh boil everything because she was a mother for the first time and she thought that that that's what but in reality what she was doing she was actually doing me more harm she didn't know that at the time and then and I say this she because she'll tell you this because kids need germs kids need bacteria kids need to get dirty kids need the floor and the dirt and all that but then when the second one came my sister Sandra you know she's back there she she was a little bit more loose after that and then with my third sister Deanna she was really loose then she didn't care and they turned out just fine in reality you know I it it you know and out of and when I was younger I was I was a little bit more sick you know I had I had asthma issues and things like that and she she she'll ask she'll tell you she said I just wonder if all that stuff that I tried to do thinking that I was doing something good it really was harming you and so so you see uh so again another lesson for those who are not parents yet let your par let your kids play with dirt let them get dirty let them learn lessons amen let them learn lessons and I say the same thing amen let people make mistakes sometimes so that they can learn okay I won't do that again amen why God wants to give us keys right when in adoption he wants to give us the keys right amen praise the Lord but sometimes we we we we think no we have to hold the keys the whole time and that person is mature enough to handle that situation to handle that that that project that you you you give them you see to handle that they can do it just pray for them and let let them let them loose because I promise you amen when you let people loose their creativity Sparks open that's right amen and they'll come and do things amen that you don't think that is in them right and it opens up amen I've seen it amen in the workplace I've seen it you know with my children I've seen it amen let them something that they're interested in and then it opens up amen and it just Sparks creativity like like nothing you're like wow this come out better than what I thought it was why because you surrendered you surrendered and you took off your control freak robe and you let them be amen and you know what and you'll be more tranquil that way you'll have more peace in your heart that's right and you'll have more peace and peace of mind and you'll have more peace with God yes amen praise the Lord and so see that goes against completely amen trying to be trying trying to have control of everything it goes completely what Jesus said here in Matthew 16 he says then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself in other words forget your ideas and take up his cross and follow me amen for whosoever will save his life amen shall lose it right and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it amen so I want to be a loser this morning so that I can win him amen I want to be a loser no I don't want to be a loser I do in this case I want to lose myself my control freak robe amen so that he can take control so I can find life and I can find peace Amen in in in the projects and the things that I'm doing Amen to fully follow Jesus is to surrender control right amen because why he surrendered control on the cross yes he totally in the father's hand right hanging on a cross naked and and and and in the way that he was totally his body totally messed up amen CU he surrendered to him amen so there's either 100% surrender or no surrender at all there there's no partial surrender amen there's no Midway surrender you either 100% surrendered or or or not surrender at all amen surrendering control is not a one a one time thing it's a continual process it's a continual process amen first Peter says humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him but what we'd like to put there is himself or ourself casting all the Care upon ourself because I care for myself and that's not how it works you're hurting yourself don't hurt yourself especially those of you who are getting older you don't need more burdens your body's already wearing down don't need more burdens amen amen I you know the more the more I see it you know my kids and and you know they're going to do what they want to do in reality right I can't control every single aspect I can't password lock and and everything in the house I can't I I'll do my best to do so amen if there's things that come in the house there are not supposed to be there I'll address them but there's I can't control every single thing they view they're going to be exposed to things in this life they're eventually they're going to be exposed of anyways so so might as well you know just okay what do you think about that so you're listening to hip-hop music what do you think about that what what do you think about that song and I'll let God take care of the of them amen because when he does it it does it it's complete all right if they do it just because I tell them to then eventually they'll come back around to it again and do it again because it's not out of them by but when we let God take control amen all right last verse here wherefore seeing we also compassed about it with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience amen the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus amen looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen looking unto him to take control of the situation amen God bless you all appreciate your your your patience godess amen and your attention
