right through it my fears are drowned in perfect love you rescued me [Music] [Applause] I am a child [Music] [Applause] in perfect love [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I am a child oh God [Music] [Applause] I'm no longer a slave to fear I am [Music] I'm no longer a slave to fear because I am a child alone amen leave that fear out that door leave that fear out there if we're children of God we should have no fear I was thinking in there a few minutes ago you know until God's finished for you the devil cannot even touch you until God's finished with you and then he might let you you know take a little you know like he did job and kind of pull back a little bit the anointing off of him you feel like you lost his Adam's house cat but you're not remember God can't unlove you but he lets you go through trial so you love him more because the problem is is we were born in sand shaped and iniquity contrary to loving God now we love the god of the evil age but we didn't love this God that we're talking about now we were we were unlovable right yeah so if we were unlovable we didn't know how to love him but now we do know how to love him yeah man I'm good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one of you with us good to have everybody kind of back with us uh there's a few that still out but pray for them and good to see brother Boyd back and um and uh got that Sugar under control yet well you'll be good you'll be it'd be gone by the end of the service you'll be fine Janice just going to quit feeding your sugar just saying but yeah but good to have everybody here if you got your Bibles let's turn to uh John 1 but today we're going to speak on today we're going to just add to what Bob just said and uh read the same scriptures Bob just read talk about the same thing brother Bob just said so [Applause] I mean you you know that's not scary I just believe it's the Lord you know getting us getting us ready to hear something and getting us and getting our mind in the right tune that's what that's what I pray when we pray in the back with the with the song leaders and different ones we pray that we get in the same channel Harmony same Harmony same channel and you know you've seen the same songs that may be part of the service and and you know that we don't know what I'm going to preach Bob doesn't know and I don't know what he's going to teach on so uh we just see that the Lord just I think he confirms that even in our Even in our ignorance sometimes we we are we're led by the spirit of God Amen so I appreciate brother Bob and his Sunday school teaching I sure do appreciate him he's a good a good addition to the church unless you're appreciate it amen and all of them everybody has their part everybody has their part and we sure appreciate it remember now my wave announcements real quick Thursday and Friday sister Junior and I'll be going to a camp meeting this would be this is the week of camp meeting at Roots North Carolina there'll be a lot of missionaries there um they were probably some preaching for us but brother Keith Reed is coming back with us on Saturday morning and then Saturday from five to six we're going to have Bible not Bible study we're going to have prayer service up here from five to six and then from six to eight we're gonna have questions and answers we already have some bring the ones that you have and we'll have a good time in the Lord but this is our regular Bible study slash questions and answers and brother Keith and sister Francine will be with us so we sure do appreciate that and then he'll be speaking for us both services on Sunday and we'll be taking communion after second service and then after the communion we'll have a 65th anniversary um little party cake and ice cream for Mom and Dad brother and sister Dale downstairs so uh 65 years wow praise God ma'am thank God the numbers get bigger but we're going to speak to you today we were talking about it I think Wednesday night a little bit but we're going to speak on one section and I may I may bring out the uh the old chalkboard tonight or this afternoon I may bring the oil dry race board but it's so I tried to get it all we haven't used it in so long I can't get the numbers off of it so I'm gonna have to find some alcohol or something to get them numbers off of it because we haven't used it in a while but remember we're talking today about your new birth not the Holy Spirit up here we'll get to that this afternoon but there's got to be it's the same Holy Spirit but it's two different sections of your journey all right just like an anointing is a section of your journey uh the virtues are a section of your journey but the new birth is the beginning of your journey so that to me that's the most important one you if you're not born again today you are not in the virtues of God you can't even understand what I'm saying today that's what the Bible says because I'll read it to you without the Holy Ghost you can't even recognize who Jesus Christ is all right because the world calls him this the world calls him that people call him this people call him that and I want to get y'all's opinion on this sister June said that uh sometimes the red is not doesn't look very good so I'm going to highlight it in a little bit a little bit of blue so um there'll be a survey after the service and uh if it's uh if it's good talk to me if I mean talk to Sister June if it's not talk to her again we're gonna get this thing in a minute where y'all can read it all right beloved Lord he's good to us isn't he I mean he really is he's good to us that we can we can come to church and we can worship God at the time we can worship him now in spirit and truth and then there won't be a time when we'll get together maybe but while we're here we're going to cherish every moment of it all right so let's bow our hands Lord thank you for this day thank you for this word that you give us Lord thank you for the brothers and sisters that's come to hear from you the ones that are at home Lord that can't come because of sickness and different things sister Freedom Mom and Dad the different ones Sister Mary sister Johnny Lord just many many ones that we ask Lord your blessings on them may they Lord feel the anointing just as we feel it today in this church father because we all brought our little licks of fire and father they have their little licks to fire wherever they are father I pray that you should be with the ones Lord that are on the highways traveling uh just bless them and take care of them be with the missionaries they're all starting to come in Lord between now and a couple weeks there'll be many many people come from many many parts of the world father what a great family that we have Lord that's scattered and that we're able to even now for a little while we're able to to converse and to fellowship with people from other countries and see how they live and how God is moving in their life and moving in their church and moving in their country Lord we pray that you'd be with them Lord as they travel give them traveling mercies Lord just bless each one forgive us of our sins in Jesus name we pray amen also brother um Jason Jackson is going to be here the next weekend which will be a Saturday night service at six o'clock and one Sunday service on August the 13th at regular time it'll be a regular service and also brother Jason is preaching this afternoon at brother Luke Gibson's sister June and I are going to go over there and we're all welcome to go if you want to go we're going to go over there if the preacher is not long-winded this afternoon we'll just have plenty of time to get there it's only about an hour from here so uh so we'll try to get finished but we'll go and support Bill Jason there he'll be here in a couple weeks also at the end of the service don't let me forget him when all the kids that are in school and all the teachers we're going to give out prayer cloths and we're going to bring you around up here to front and we're going to pray over you all right because school year starts uh school year starts here pretty quick and we need all the help we can get they need all the help they can give amen so we're going to do that we're going to pray over each and every one so in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flashing dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the golden begotten the father full of grace truth John 3 3 Jesus answered and said unto them very very I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nick your name is saith unto him how can a man be born when he's old he's taught he he is his mind is way back in the Old Testament colonel all right but Jesus is what he's trying to get him to see the New Testament the new way and we'll get into that just a little bit can he enter the second time in his mother's womb be born no if he did that you'd be the same person he was when you came out the first time all right but Jesus said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God and that s is capitalized So it's talking about the holy spirit that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit his spirit so there's a distinction Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again you may be seated it's not a suggestion it's not a you might need to be you must be Born Again amen so let's let's read there in First Corinthians 2 verse 12. the Bible says now we have received not the spirit of the world we talked about this a little bit Wednesday night so what's going to separate us the Holy Ghost is the only thing that's going to separate us from the world everybody with me it's not to this and that and going to church and reading your Bible and getting stars and you know believing brother Brown was a prophet and I'm living the best way I can't know you got to receive the spirit that is not of this world because you'll always wind yourself back around to the spirit of the world if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will always wind yourself back to where you were to begin with everybody with me all right but the spirit which is of god we don't have the spirit of the world we have the spirit which is of god that we might what know the things that are freely given to us of God we'll talk about in just a minute but let me just put something in your into your memory as Bob was talking um this morning remember those people in the Old Testament they didn't know who Jesus Christ was they didn't know this Plan of Redemption they were part of it but they didn't know it they didn't know all they knew was depend on that priest depend on that priest that's all they knew they didn't know any of this they didn't have a Bible that's right oh yeah they had the Torah later on because Moses wrote them you know the first five books in the Bible so they didn't have that in scroll form but they didn't have it where they could take it home and read it they would just wait till Sunday or Saturday actually for the Sabbath day they would read the how Jehovah was you know this and Moses was this and how Moses led the people out of the children of Israel and I appreciate that amen but I want the god of that I appreciate people that can tell me that they were in meetings with brother Branham and they were this and they were that and they went fishing with him hunting with him I got the belt buckle and all that stuff that's like Moses though yeah it's just it's just a story if that God's not made alive in your heart same way with brother random brother Brown what my God but if I got the god that William Branham had and the god that William Branham brought it will turn me to that message it will turn me to that messenger and know that he was the messenger of this day no doubt no one else no other man had a message like that man had which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual so we have if you're not now you you are a natural person by birth but you have become by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you become a spiritual person you become where you listen to what God Said you listen to what God Said though through man you got to remember Paul take to Paul take Paul the great master builder Paul was writing 80 percent of the old of the New Testament how did he write 80 percent of the of the Old Testament or the New Testament he got it from the Old Testament but he was able to run it through his filter of the Holy Ghost to be able to write Hebrews 11 Hebrews 10 Hebrews 9 and explain every one of those things that was never explained in the Old Testament so here we are in a new testament here we are we should be illuminated so much more I mean you know honestly just think about the people in the Old Testament they just kind of went through their life and that was about it that's not me and you we have a Christian journey to walk they didn't have a Christian journey to walk they walked according sometimes to their flesh and but they'll walk some of them by faith some of them didn't care whether there was a sacrifice made some of them would absolutely cry their eyes out trying to get that off of them but when they laid their hands on that animal the animal spirit left but the spirit that was inside that made that man do it it didn't leave listen it didn't have to there was nothing to clean it up but when Jesus come Spirit couldn't only leave it came back and it came back to make somebody Eternal not just patch them up not just sending the bike to a tabernacle I don't mean the one in Jeffersonville either Acts 19 verse 1 and it came to pass it while Apollos was a Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus in finding certain disciples now we're going to get to this in just a minute or maybe this afternoon this is a this is a spot where to me it's a a turning point in the Bible because you've got Luke is writing this commentary right he's with Paul most of the time so he writes the book of Acts and here Paul comes to this certain group of people that maybe he heard of before he said man they're having some powerful service Services they're having some you know some seems like Holy Ghost Field Services they were anointed right and how the Holy Ghost but they were preaching as if they had the Holy Ghost come on right right now watch finding certain disciples so it was people that sat in a message Church they were a narrow message church for the day but they had not met the messenger yet he was fixing to show up and ask them a question I want you to get into this with me he asked him a question he said if you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe this message have you ever seen the Holy Ghost since you've received this new way that you're in now and they said we don't know what you're talking about now here they are versed in whatever they're versed in John's baptism unto repentance they were repentant they were they they were trying to get their heart right but they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they thought they were in the message oh come on somebody they thought they were in the message they were in John's message because you're going to read we'll read a little bit later on this is just a snippet of it but a little bit later on he said well how are you baptized Paul now here's Paul the master builder he what he's doing is he's tearing down their Tabernacle he's tearing down their Idol and he's showing them the real way he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said unto him we ain't even heard of this new message we hadn't even heard in other words we're going to read where brother Brown says and I finally I found it the other day where brother Brown says in blasphemy misnames he said it's an ill-taught subject the baptism of the Holy Ghost people teach it this way and teach it that way well that's what was happening here they just wasn't calling it The Holy Ghost they were teaching that they were Christians without the Holy Ghost but when but when the messenger of the hour when he walks on the scene and and and somebody heard his voice they said we don't know what you're talking about but we're not going to run out of the building we're going to sit here and listen to what you got to say and they did and he what happened later on as we continue on Paul expounded on them about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he laid hands on them and the Holy Ghost came on them that was a very powerful church it was about 12 people in that church there all right so we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost so so the basis I'm trying to show you is is they were taught this way this was it right here yeah measure of the hour John we were baptized under John's baptism well you hear Brother Brown many times he said well that ain't good enough now it was good then yeah Luther's message was good then Wesley's message was good then Pentecost message was good then but not now we moved on brother Brown said you must be born again you must be born again now God bless his word I want to take the subject this morning Jesus's first Doctrine so the first Doctrine Jesus had was what you must be born again that was his first doctrine that was the first thing when he came on the scene he was trying to get the people to see all right and it looked it was a new way because none I've heard about that before they never heard that there was going to be this this uh uh holy ghost from Ohio and it's gonna enter in burn the old you out because remember they're used to going making the sacrifices the old you stand the old you and you're fighting and fighting and fighting your old nature kind of like us before the new birth all right so I want to take the subject the first Doctrine Jesus says is you must be born again now in the way of Sunday school so I don't want preach and horse myself for tonight I thought in my heart this is something that seems puzzling puzzling to the people we hear so much about it all the time and I thought it would be good this morning if we just searched the subjects through and clear it out and watch him that's a very deep subject it's a very deep one and we find out that there's so many different meanings that people put on it nearly all churches say You must be born again but each one has their different interpretation to it what it means to be born again now listen Jesus didn't say you must be born again 17 different ways he said you must be born of water and spirit and then he just finally puts a cap on says you gotta be born from above you can't be born from down here you got to be born from something coming from another dimension into this Dimension and that brother Bob said is what change you not Pat you up my go to the Methodist and they say we believe you must be born again how do you interpret that I go to the Baptist now you know Baptist sorry y'all Baptist you go up you shake the hand you get the right-handed Fellowship they put your name on a roll they stick it in a box and you're born again from there to the rest of your life doesn't matter how much cigarettes you smoke how many times you've been divorced married or if you ever even come to church again no we know that's not true I do believe it once always say brother remember did too but if once truly saved you're always safe so he said look he said if we went to 900 different denominations that'd be 900 different interpretations so seeing that there's so many different interpretations and yet a Bible Doctrine there must be and is a truce somewhere so now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again it said you must be born again now we as English-speaking people understand the word must means that is absolutely you've got to do it see it's a must not you ought to you'd be better off if you did but you must be born again or if we can just take that word this morning and break it down what it means and that's totally impossible in other words to preach it in one sermon then if it's that essential and that great then it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven or even see it until you're born again and so many different interpretations of that were born again we ought to seek it out with all the heart find out what it means now we know in this church I believe we've been taught the way to be born again all right and but we've got some new ones here and we've got some ones coming from different places so we want to reiterate um and listen if it's one of the most ill-taught subjects it's a subject that's important to preach okay if it was Ill taught in the 60s it sure is he'll talk even in the message of the hour because they tell you that all you got to do is come to message church and and some say just press play and some just say do this and some say do that and and there's never a birth it's just well I've been I've sent the message church for 35 years you've been lost for 35 years too if you didn't get the new birth amen you must be born again 1961 brother Ryan said no matter how much we try to think we're right in saying a Creed or joining a church or let me interplay or you always was eternal you always this you always that we're the bride Hallelujah we are you're the bride only if you're born again only if you come through justification sanctification and baptism with Holy Ghost can you be bride amen you're not bribed by automatic that's right that's too easy well it's not hard to be born again but you fight it because your old nature don't want it I'm sorry mine didn't maybe yours did that's the worst fighting ever done it's myself all right I got somebody Mansion maybe you'll think about it watch this right here though brother Brown says that no matter how much that we try to think we're right in saying a Creed or joining a church because remember the Apostles Creed and remember all these different things you say even the Catholic Church tells you you know that that you don't get the Holy Ghost the the priest does but he gives it to you and by you know speaking to you in a language you can't understand and you guys play money and say Hail Marys and all that stuff that would be rough but look you're still what you were until you're actually born again amen so I don't care how many quotes how many times you can come to church how many times you get stars behind beside your name until you're born again you cannot understand this message it doesn't change you to recite John 3 16. Hebrews 13 8. Revelations 10 7. Malachi 4 5. it doesn't change you your Creed joining church or changing your ideas are your good intentions although as good as it might seem it's still not right amen there's something got to happen look the new birth is an absolute I'm going to put that word out it's an absolute experience something that takes place amen so it's not that you bring so it's not that that brings the new birth in other words to Creed and you know coming to church and all that okay now the different churches they say well you accept this or believe this it's all right but it isn't now to begin with to base back the reason we have to be born again is because the Bible teaches us look that we were all born in sin all right so if you start there just start there don't start that I will just create something back in eternity I was just getting this as one person I was this I was that you were lost if you come through your mama's womb I don't care who you are baby you were born lost there was only one man that came through the womb that was not lost and that's Jesus Christ all right well now if he's inside of you but he wasn't inside of you when he was crying baby down in the hospital or wherever you got born at because remember Nicodemus Jesus said uh that one will kill you I'm trying to get you to see this new one that birth will kill you I'm trying to get to see a new one and I'm telling you that birth will kill you your first birth you're dead born dead we were all born in sin shaped and iniquity and come to this world speaking lies then that shows us that our nature to begin with is sinful to start with yes I know we know that but we need to reiterate that there was no yes we were a gene seed of God in the mind of God but not in your soul your soul was as black as pitch you were dead and on your way to hell William Marion Branham he said he was I'm just quoting him he's sinful to start with we're no good to begin with so we cannot claim anything by our shrewdness by our sincerity our how great we are how little we are or whatever more we're all together wrong to begin with and there is nothing at all that we can do about it the beginning right the beginning is what we can't do anything about you never not one of you decided to be born as a as a human child not one of you it was the Providence of God that got you here so you can make a choice he gave you a soul so you can make a choice so like Genesis 1 we go back to that Genesis one man and we see that that was the children of God that is the bride that's God being able to develop himself in a group of people but then what happened with Adam and Eve in the fall the the as brother Ryan was said one time is he said everything got cloudy and Adam Adam used to have a clear mind and Eve had a clear mind but all of a sudden the cloud started rolling in he couldn't talk to God like he used to talk to God now he didn't lose his soul he didn't lose his salvation he lost his position all right he lost his position of what God had put him as the god of the Earth and Eve right beside him then he had to go into the second Covenant to put Adam here and Eve here because of the fall but he didn't destroy Adam and Eve no he put him on out there and let him live 900 years to start the genealogy natural genealogy of man all right but Adam and Eve's one that you know Adam's one that sold us out we know that all right so what Adam did is Adam forfeited brother Brown says forfeited eternal life now listen he didn't forfeit eternal life in his soul now I want you to understand something once God puts eternal life in your soul he can never take it out I don't care how bad you are remember brother Brown said you could get a spirit on your spirit commit suicide and still be the Bride of Jesus Christ because of our Humanity that we're in that Adam sold that part of us out because look Adam couldn't make us Born Again Adam wasn't my savior so I needed a savior Adam thought he could save Eve but he needed save it oh he figured that out and when he figured that out he went out the garden with Eve and God said all right now I don't think Adam got out there and sat down on a rock and I was thinking about this Adam you know he was this he was just he was the great one control to see control the air control this I'm talking about the whole world Listen he didn't control his little like we're sitting in a building today he controlled the world and then all of a sudden he lost that there you go he lost that Fellowship now I don't believe Adam if if God took eternal life away from him I'd have been really mad but Adam understood that he lost his position and he accepted that and I believe this is just me and we can get to talk to him later on amen but he didn't just go over there and sit get up go up in the mountain and just sit there and saw for 900 years because remember he lived 900 years after that whatever the recording of time was he lived 900 years no you know what he did he told his children what happened he told his girls and his boys what happened and what to stay away from and I believe he was a master physician I believe God still give him the responsibility of putting herbs together and because they start getting sick and there was no Pharmacy he was the Apothecary he did understand that if you take zinc and this and put it together that you would put it on a sore because they started getting sick they started having children diseases Came Upon them and here's Adam saying we can't go in there but I was in there one time and let me tell you this is what you need to do to live better I just believe that because I don't believe he just shut up and went over and sat somewhere for 900 years no he was active he had kids he had wife he had all these different things you know so anyway nuts just a little snippet that we sometimes we we think of Adam well Adam he got drove out of the Garden of Eden and then we just kind of the you know the story kind of Peter's out we always call it you know there's nothing else goes on no they had a life Abraham my life Abraham had a life at the South he mad whatever the weather girl's name was he married her and had a life right so anyway I want to talk to them about their lives if not was recorded in the Bible I want to talk to somebody about the one I can't read hey man I just want to do that I mean because they live their life they didn't just live that little well you know Genesis 12 13 14 through 18 and then Abraham no he kept living and brother Brown said what did Abraham do Abraham taught his children about God all right so they didn't just sit down and stalk like we do God don't answer our prayer or we get a little something going on and we just say well God he's not even nowhere around no he's right there with you but you got to be born again first and his brother Bob alluded to Joel 2 28. and it shall come to pass afterwards now watch now why is God doing this because God's going to pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh you know why because there's going to be anointings there's going to be anointed ones there's going to be different things that's going to have to happen so he's going to pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh all right and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old man see dreams young men shall see visions and also upon the servant handmade everybody in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in heaven the Earth Blood Fire pills of smoke sun will be turned to Darkness mean moon to blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come now watch and it shall come to pass to whosoever shall call in the name of the Lord now Joel you said you're gonna pull out your spirit on All Flesh and now listen All Flesh is not going to call in the name of the Lord some are going to hate the Lord someone gonna hate the name of the Lord but he's still poured out his spirit so that you can receive it all right by what whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and Jerusalem shall be what a way out Deliverance as the Lord has said in the remnant who the Lord shall call Hebrews 9 verse 1 says invariate the first Covenant and also ordinances of divine service I want you to watch this just for a second and a worldly sanctuary all right so the sanctuary was down here all right everybody with me for there was a tabernacle made and the first we're in was the Candlestick now we always take Outer Court inner Court holy of holies three sections there's only two remember the outer Court is for everybody even Gentiles could come into that outer core it wasn't protected by God's law so much as the second one is or the first one going in when you go in the first one what is it there was a tabernacle made the first swim was the Candlestick the table shoe bread which is called The Sanctuary that was what the second not the holy of holies no no no it was a second Sanctuary the first one out here all right the first I mean the the just say this your flesh your spirit yes and your soul that's what the Tabernacle really was because you flash everything can happen there it's all out you know you're out here you just um you're under the elements if it rained it rained on you if the Sun was shining it signed on you if it was dark it was dark on you all right but you went into that second and the veil comes down and it's covered and then there's a what there's a Candlestick a table shoe bread and all that means something I'm not gonna get to it right now we've been to it many many times all right now look after the second bail so that you've got to go through the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holy of holies now look which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the gold pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant what was that the Ten Commandments and over at the cherubs of Glory shattered The Mercy Seat and of which we cannot now speak particularly look now when these things were thus ordained and the priest went always into the first Tabernacle so he could go in and out that first Tabernacle many priests many preachers could go in that first Tabernacle right all right now when these things were thus ordained the priests went all ways into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people now that's Jesus Christ he was the only one who could go back in that Veil and take his blood amen shed it for us yes come back out and say you're redeemed all right because remember this Blood was the blood of an animal he could go in and sprinkle and come back out said your sins are covered not forgiven in the Old Testament right your sins are covered not forgiven all right the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing now I made that in bold letters because I want you to understand if you don't now there was no new birth in the Old Testament now I've had preachers fight me on this and I don't see why because it just takes away from everything that Jesus Christ did I know that the Old Testament Saints are going to be given eternal life I know that for a fact I know that John Baptist got the Holy Ghost because the Bible said he did but he didn't say the new birth I know y'all know that but maybe some that don't you can realize how important this Holy Ghost is it look the Holy Ghost this signifying watch that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while that first Tabernacle was standing right so while that first Tabernacle in the Old Testament was standing no one got the new birth when Jesus Christ was standing in his Temple there was no new birth yet come on nobody got born again while Jesus was alive they had to die he had to die to bring this new way this New Testament in my blood he says so while the first Tabernacle was standing no New Birth why they had an anointing we've covered it Moses different ones they had an anointing we'll cover in just a second just just for a minute while that's the first time Tabernacle was yet standing look which was a figure for the time then present because Jesus hadn't come yet and which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect now what was the promise given as we're going to reiterate what brother Robert said what was that promise the promise was I'm Gonna Come staying according to Genesis 3 15 I'm coming back I'm gonna do it I'm not sending an animal I'm not sending a second person of a Trinity I'm gonna fix this thing myself and if God's perfect then he fixed it perfect he could not make the people in the Old Testament perfect as we're going to read in Hebrews as pertaining to the conscious Inside Man look which stood only in meats and drinks and many Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them it had to be yes listen Adam and Eve had to be covered I thought they would have died that's right they were covered yes by a substitute until the real person came imposed on them until the time of reformation but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood yes he entered in one time not every year not every time somebody needed it having obtained Eternal Redemption for us Hallelujah for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of heifers sprinkled the unclean Sanctified them then why'd we need cross Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit not an animal never in their life on an eternal spirit but Jesus Christ did he was the eternal spirit and he could give it out and not diminish yourself you know an animal died if a lamb died it wasn't 25 different lives one out of that animal one went out and never made the camera there until perfect as the Bible says but when Christ died he could multiply himself the only one that can all right how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience now here we go purge your conscious from dead Works to serve the Living God we're talking about the New Birth today you must be born again right down here at the bottom this is Elementary but guess what we might all need to get born again look and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament remember he stood up and said this is a new testament in my blood the Old Testament was the blood of bulls and ghosts that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the under the first testament he's a promise of Eternal inheritance now listen they didn't get that in the Old Testament but now remember when Jesus died on the cross like I said before we're not saying I say we I say us that believe and know that there was no new birth in in the Old Testament they're not all going to hell no that's the grace of God that when he throw both hands out like this he went Old Testament New Testament he just the New Testament was in his blood they could be made perfect these were made perfect and have not been yet though but they will be made perfect by us according to Hebrews 11. for where a testament is now what's a testament Testament something wrote down like a will right everybody with me right so what was wrote down Moses law la la la la la do this don't do that right but there's a new testament a new testament in my blood he said but now look for where a testament is there must also necessity be the death of the testator in other words if this this will is not in force the will that I have written the will you have written the will that our fathers and mothers have written never is in force until you die that's when it's put in force for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the test there to liveth listen no one was saved with the new birth while Jesus was here thy kingdom come he said thy will be done he had the kingdom inside but he had to let it out Hebrews 10 verse 14. for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified couldn't happen in the Old Testament wherever the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities well I remember no more somebody read that this morning sorry I already had it there so now look at the Old Testament just for a minute maybe this will explain a lot more to you because Moses had an anointing he had power without character Joey had power he had an anointing that Joel said I pour out my spirit on All Flesh now listen but now Moses was picked for a purpose remember he was a proper child God knew he would do the things he did the bad ones and the good ones God knew what you'd do the Bad and the good so David Sampson Abraham Jacob Noah saw Elisha and all Hebrews 11. that Bob was talking about this morning all those the Great Hall of Fame of faith not one of them obtained the promise the promise that God stood in the Garden of Eden and he said I will put enmity between me and The Serpent and between me and you but I'm coming back I'm going to put this puzzle back together I'm going to be the peace that Satan's not going to know anything about Saint said oh I got them now they're out there and this God's going to kill them everyone well bless his heart didn't have him brotherly but though Devil's persistent he's still going since a dawn of time but he was anointed he was anointed for a job and he's trying to do his job but he's trying to do his job not the job he was given so Hebrews 11 39 so as Bob was reading today we read all Abraham all the great people of faith that we we build our foundation of Faith home remember that's the Hall of Fame Hebrews 11 is the Hall of Fame of faith but it's all Old Testament don't call nobody's name in there from the New Testament Paul said in all these having obtained a good report through faith now I even like you if you go back a little bit further you'll read that Paul is telling you about all these great people and he puts in parentheses and he interplays he says of whom the world is not worthy to for them to even be here all these things that happen to them all they were for an example sure but the world was not even worthy to have them in the in their in their uh on the soil but God wanted him there for an example for me and you and all these things all right Paul's writing his report what did Isaiah say who has believed our report somebody wrote something down about somebody because I just believe that Abraham probably didn't know much about being the father of our faith he just knows he was strange maybe his neighbor knew he was strange lot probably knew he was a little bit strange but he didn't know he'd be his incompass about six chapters in the Old Testament that we have talked about Abraham and still talking about Abraham for six thousand years his life so that was important today what through faith receive not the promise the promise is I'm going to come back I'm going to take that Genesis 1 man and I'm going to put it in the hearts of my believers I'm not going to I'm not going to anoint him I will still continue doing on them but I'm going to put myself inside of them because I'm going to be able to burn out that old nature if you're not born again today you have not had a burning to burn your old nature out you married your two husbands actually and that's against the Bible God look God having provided some better thing for us New Testament that they without us should not be made perfect are complete so so where are they they're somewhere you can say whatever kind of body they're in I just know one thing's for sure the Bible says that they will not be made perfect to We Are so you can put them wherever you want to put them that's fine with me like brother Ram said if you believe he's coming on a cloud or a horse that's okay as long as you believe he's coming that's what he said that's a quote I just believe they're waiting somewhere in an incomplete form because you know been made perfect but they're in a dimension somewhere and and God's got them there listen we God don't need us to tell them where to put them he pushing where he wants to put him right and I you know what I'm happy with that yes sir I just know one thing for sure there's a sixth Dimension where the bride is and God didn't and brother Brown didn't see Abraham Isaac or Jacob in that dimension all right so there must be a dimension that they're all in waiting for us to come to a body change so that they can have their change of their body so there we go so in Acts 2 38 what is this promise what is This Promise they didn't receive this promise well Acts 2 38 will tell you what it is then Peter's standing and then repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission he sent and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise the promise of what the Holy Ghost isn't to you and to your children to all them that are far off even as men as the Lord Our God shall call thereby with me so there's your promise they didn't receive that promise all right listen they could repent and listen they can even be baptized under John's baptism because that's what remember Palmetto's people but they want Paul says look that's good but you're not perfect yet that's good but listen you gotta listen to the updated message it came from Paul we gotta listen to the updated message I read this his message I see brother round was saying Luther's message he could stand and preach today and we'd say Amen to most what he said but not all because he's trinitarian but when he said to just shall live by faith amen for the promise isn't to you and to your children all that are far off him as men of the Lord Our God shall call all right everybody with me so let's talk about this just for a minute and then we'll get into it maybe this afternoon even the bottom I want to stay down here let's don't even talk about that Holy Spirit up there because it's the same spirit because God don't have a one spirit all right you either got a Holy One or an Unholy one and I saw two you know that that's so let's bring that down though that's in your soul today either the Holy Spirit or the Unholy Spirit that's in your soul there's only two things in this encompasses your soul today is either black or white now anointings can fall on the outside guy I can follow on the memory reason conscious face imagination from both sides good and bad you just had a bad thought see it's already on the battle black famous names watch brothers look says I believe that the reasons that there's no there's so much confusion today there's so much confusion today about the holy spirit it's not correctly taught I believe that the baptism is taught just say the baptism but then be like you said automobile but now I've got several mechanics in the church so do we and I don't know one thing about it so if I make a mistake brother I'm calling brother Donnie remember I'm not a mechanic there has to be calls plugs points valves and everything else that makes the automobile and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that all right see there's a lot goes with that and here is what I think that God is proving that the holy spirit is here because what he the real holy spirit is going to what lead you and guide you into all truth it's going to teach you how to get him it's going to teach you how to get him all right it's not gonna Lead You astray listen Satan can't tell you how to get the new birth he can give you and he can give you an anointing to make you act like you got the new birth to a degree yeah that's anointed ones remember he's anointed now Peter said first Faith now watch real close you're talking about down here he's going to Blasphemous names he's talking about the pyramid first you got faith now is your first now add your faith virtue and we've been through all that let's continue on now then from this and then brings this into seven Church ages God is building in seven Church ages of Bride for Christ so that's his whole intent for the Gentile bride and I got to bring this in because there's a bride of Old Testament that he that he divorced there's a bride of the New Testament that he has here which is the bride of Christ through seven Church ages then after the seven Church ages over now there's not a bride in the in the uh at the 144 000 but they do get the baptism of those all right so it's saying it's not anointing it's a birth all right so let's read in Ezekiel we've read this many times before I'm gonna read again because to me if you read this without the holy ghost or even if you read this without a prophet telling you what this means you're going to be totally confused all right so let's read it Ezekiel 36 22 therefore say unto the house of Israel now listen this is the Ezekiel and ain't right he could be talking about the remnant and then talking about you he'd be talking about the Saints in the Old Testament and be talking about you all right thereby with me so what he's doing is he's telling Israel I'm Gonna Save You it's Ezekiel prophesying to Israel that I'm going to save you I'm going to give you a new heart I'm going to take the stone but this is to me and you and our new birth because the prophet of God he said many many times he said you know in other words paraphrasing that that this is what's right about this it's not the Holy Spirit come in the first spirit and buy with me see some of you that somebody's not understanding so let's go to it therefore stands into the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God in other words it's going to happen I do not this for your sakes o House of Israel but from my holy namesake so anybody that's under the name of the Lord Jesus which you have profaned among the Heathen whether you went shame on you shame on us right right listen we profane the the Holy Name Of God until we got born again and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen which you have profaned in the midst of them now he's talking about Israel he's talking about all the other the Gentiles all right now watch and the Heathen Gentiles shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in you yes in you before their eyes Jews on the day of Pentecost 120 of them those were it fell on Jews first we know it went to the Gentiles but it fell on the Jews first because remember excuse me the Jews in a certain place there in the book of Acts they Marvel that's a gentile cops to receive the same Holy Ghost they had they thought that promise was just that I mean Jews were just that way I I I'm God's people it ain't for you for you tell you now where Israel well then Paul walks up and I bet you in a congregation when he said not all Israel's Israel that's probably when they tried to Stone him because then big proud Israelites are like what must God I'll talk to my priest about that all right so look for I will take you from among the heathen me for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring to you you into your own land this is the promise in the millennium God's Gonna Save Israel as a nation and put them in the millennium then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you praise God I'll take that a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you now if you stop right there you say man this is great he's going to give me a new way a new spirit and he's going to put his holy spirit in me wrong answer that's not what it says thank God for a prophet a new heart also also and I will give you an heart of Flesh now you're talking about a Stony heart now Israel a Jew Bruce Tony look verse 27 though is real clear and I who's I who's talking Jehovah God and I will put my spirit now that's one I want I will put my spirit within you and cause you rudder cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall show my judgments and do them we'll read what brother Brown says about that in a minute so let's look at justification just for a second if that's all right and then we'll we'll um start this afternoon a little bit more so justification we know that that uh when brother Brown teaches us that we're Justified that we our past sins are chopped off but it really does nothing for our nature we're still rotten filthy inside right right but justification though is being saved all right it's a fine line there you can't stay like that forever but it is part of your journey and if you do pass away or die during that time you're going to heaven but you're not right because you believe and I will listen Romans 5 verse 1 says therefore being justified by faith all right believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved everybody with me all right but that's not all of it not in this age in this age there's a call for more there's a call to sanctify that vessel clean that thing up and God will do it therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God to our Lord Jesus Christ listen you need to know this when you got Justified did you not feel at peace I did that God didn't remember that junk I just got finished giving to it how happy we should be Justified freely and those who is really Justified he's already glorified praise God [Applause] therefore being justified by faith I believe that when I ask God to forgive me of my sins that he's just to do it he's just to do it because you know why he's got to go by what his word says and to be just to be a righteous judge if you stand there and say God I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired forgive me of my past and he will but now remember that guy that made you do those bad things is still in there all right and then if a week from now you turn around and go back out in the world you did get Justified from what you did from there back but for what you did from there forward you're still the account is being added up again and somewhere God's going to call you to that second stage all right therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have low access listen when you get Justified you get access to God because you've come to a place that you like I said sick and tired of being sick and tired yeah by whom also we have access by faith into what this grace when we stand what is the grace watch this John 3 16 there's our Grace for God 's going to receive it amen only a certain group is going to grab it and say Hey I want that yeah thank you don't grab it and say I might want that for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life be justified today and get killed in a car wreck you're going to heaven but now six months from now if you're still as sorry as you were that's for God to decide all right but you buy your fruit she'll be known god listen if you were truly Justified if you stand right here any of you you stand right here and you know what you've done from here backwards because you were there right and you knew what you've done but you literally believed that by some way somehow this amazing God don't remember that no more now we might but we see there's the faith you got to have faith that God forgave you of that and that's not piled on top of you brother George that's not piled on you anymore listen the devil may want to drag that thing out of the Sea of God's forgetfulness but you put a no fishing sign up leave me alone but see you got to have faith though you can't say well now well now devil I you know he may not have amen and you know what if you think that he didn't when I got Justified I knew the things I'd done for 20 something years out in the world I knew what I'd done because I was there me and the devil both and I knew enough of the Bible not the message of the hour I knew enough of the Bible that he who has truly repented God will cut your sins off now it says and give you everlasting life it's you're going to something you're going to get eternal life if you if you truly because see the Bible says those who has Justified he's already glorified now if he justified you he's he's going to glorify you but you gotta you got a journey to go there all right it ain't just instant but if you're truly Justified the day you got you gottified if you realize if today you got really Justified you got a glorified body something somewhere somehow and they don't be under somewhere it's being built right here if you really believe that but if it's just an emotion or just a well I felt good that preacher made me cry that's okay I can make you cry people cry at funerals remember brother Brandon the first sermon he preached the old man said brother Brown said May Cry at funerals he said bro I made him cry for God sent not his son in the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already so it all comes down to Faith because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God in other words you don't know who he is he can't save you if you don't know who he is because he's the saber savior sanctifier Holy Ghost filler you got to remember that that's him that's his title and then as we see that we need to go to the part of water baptism all right it's not essential but you sure need to be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ real quick sanctification now listen here's where brother Brown says you get this new heart that Ezekiel is talking about or this new spirit and by with me not the Holy Spirit not yet but he's going to give you a new spirit even brother Brown tells you he says he's going to give you a new spirit so that you can what so you can deal with your own self because you're fixing to go through something that your whole life you have based on that out there everything revolved around the world and now you've come to this new way this new part of your life that you've been Justified then you come to a new place and let's read this real quick and then we'll close I'm sorry it may take a minute over but I got to get to this right here so he gives you a new spirit and brother Brown says that's not the whole Holy Spirit I didn't bring the quote so because you already should knew that know this that's a new spirit that's that's a new that's a new way a new a new feeling if you want to say you can go by feelings if you wish but it's a new spirit in other words so that what he does he softens up he's continuing to soften that Stony heart up make it pliable where he can use it and we can let him but he gives us that new spirit at sanctification now what is sanctification we know this is what cleaned and set aside for service not put in service all right because listen Judas was sanctified by the Lord himself not by some second rate something he was justified and Sanctified by the Lord Jesus himself amen all right so Judas was what he just didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul first Thessalonians 4 verse 3 said for this is the will of God all right what is the will of God's word of God even your sanctification so his whole word is cleaning us up washing of Water by what the word all right that you should abstain from fornication now watch that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor so it's a learning process it's a learning process Matthews 12 43 when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walks through now remember this is not justification because the unclean spirit's still in there at justification this is sanctification when you get that new spirit when you get that new heart when you get when you start coming to church you start reading your Bible when the unclean spirit's gone out of a man you're walking through Dry places seek his wrath and findeth none then he saith I will return into my house but once I came from till the devil still got claims on you that's what he says and when he has come he finds it empty swept and garnished not just piled over in a corner somewhere not just like we do sometimes open the closet and throw everything in it and shut the door well praise the Lord uh anyway I I just heard that happen well I'm in trouble now okay on my closet doors but no he finds that empty swept and garnish listen we laugh but listen when the Holy Spirit cleans you out he don't leave anything lacking when he says I'll clean you up he don't leave a corner but you gotta let him then go with him take to themselves seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in what that same place that has been cleaned and swept and garnished in other words the old the old thinking has been taken out but what does the devil do if we don't fill it with the Holy Ghost what happens he sends seven more more wicked than himself first then the first generation real quick John 17 17 says sanctify them this is Jesus sanctify them through thy truth now how are you going to get Sanctified amen amen by the truth by the word our problem is we get Justified we get to feeling good we know that God and listen and know that God saved you now that God forgive you your sins then you started to church but the first little something happens I won't do anything Spirit out the door and I stay here stay under the water and under the water if you'll get under the water you will get wet yeah that's right sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is true man I'm telling you you gotta fight to keep them Devils out right but let God help you let the washing of the Water by the word that's what gets me I'm sorry just for a minute if I go over a minute just eat a banana instead of eating a regular meal it'll help you lose weight yeah I am preaching brother you need that and that it'll help you with your sugar if you quit eating it I am preaching brother so I forgot my whole thought so I forgot but no sanctify him through thy truth Thy word is truth and you but you see somebody and I'm sorry because I I'm not I'm not I'm not building myself up by no means but I'm telling you one thing when I was out in the world and I did some stupid stuff I didn't come running to church because I knew enough that if I ran in here and I wasn't ready I just go right back out and do the same thing over and over again I'm not advocating stay away from church but I'm telling you every time I had some little something in my life me and Jim or different things in my life as a non-Christian I didn't run here because I knew I wasn't living right to start with I knew I had to be changed but what problem is somebody comes to that door they want their situation changed they don't want their person changed hello somebody I'm gonna preach for a minute they want their they want their situation changed but they don't want to change their person be living in saying you're gonna go right back out there living in sin and you know what it's going to pile on top of you just like I read that unclean spirit's gonna bring seven other guys and you're gonna be seven times worse listen we all have problems and issues but when you come and know and you come here and you want me or somebody to solve your problems you are the problem get you straightened out get you saved and follow the Holy Ghost I can't save you and I can't feel you but I can tell you what to do but that was my whole thing I said and until I until I know God had to knock me off of the knock me off the dock up there in Gainesville everybody knows my story most of you do until that happened brother Colin I knew I was a mate believer I wasn't going to just start coming to church just because I had this little issue and because I know this is a place to come you know my dad's gonna help me because I'm gonna come in the church doors you know no I needed a me change one more time don't come into this church not saved not for the Holy Ghost now listen Holy Ghost fill people you've got problems too I'm sorry do you all have problems okay just want to make sure you want to make sure it wasn't just me but now holy ghost Phil people do the same thing though you can tell when when not you broccoli but you know you'll say broccoli brother Kylie Brother Kyle brother Wayne brother Wayne brother Connor but college does something kind of a little bit wrong hey bro God bless you boy because you're ashamed because you're inside of you there's something inside of you tell you shouldn't have done what you did well that's the same way if you're not safe but if you're not safe don't run away listen if you're born again won't run away you might step out for a Time maybe one service put not 10 in a row if you want help there's help here but you gotta want it you don't you you can't want it to get a better car or you can't want it to get a better wife or you can't want it to get more finances or whatever you know you gotta won't have yourself changed how to do that repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of your sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for that what promise and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the two truth Ephesians 5 verse 25 husbands love your wives let's stand our feet nope we'll just have a song uh acapella don't come up here and if anybody has a need I hate staying over but I wanted to get this out but I still didn't get to the Holy Ghost Ephesians 5 25 says husbands love your wives what's a good one to end on them even as Christ also love the church and what gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by I'm gonna say his word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish First Corinthians 6 verse 9 says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived look neither fornicators I don't want you to raise your hand but we're all in this group and we don't have a chance without God everybody with me read this be not deceived neither fornicators idolaters adulterers effeminate abusers of themselves with mankind thieves covetous drunkards revilers extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God you're all going to hell and such were some of you but you're washed you stay [Applause] out of you and you became a Christian but you're washed but you are sanctified justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God that's just that sanctification though folks we're not talking about the birth yet where he puts my spirit or God puts his spirit in us this all happens before that and that's the whole problem we have is sometimes we think well we got the new birth just because we got a Sanctified condition feel good you know unclean spirit's gone out but it's not remember it's set aside for service not in service and it's not sealed so whatever is in here can get out or whatever's out there can get in we want the ceiling all right we want that we want that thing to be sealed up till the day of our Redemption you love the Lord think about this think on these things think about your justification think about your walk with God are you did you truly get Justified did you truly get Sanctified and then did you truly continue on to the baptism of holy ghost or did you just want uh and and you know we always say that we giggle when we say people find Jesus in jail well that's kind of what it is it's kind of that you got caught and you've become under a conviction of just getting caught don't get quiet on me let's hope that's not what happens with your situation that you truly want to get rid of it that you truly want to be justified and you believe that there's a justifier standing here that will do it and then there's a sanctifier and what is it it's the water of the word yeah listen when you come to a place of sanctification yeah you might have still have you might be leaning a little bit back towards the toward the world a little bit but but you read your Bible instead of whatever else she was reading before you got to make a step now listen when you get Sanctified God's not going to throw the Bible in front of you and say hey read that you gotta want to see yeah you gotta want to be washed by the water of the word listen before we go Legion had Legions of demons that were tormenting him Legions of demons but when he come to Jesus he didn't run away he confronted the Lord and them Demons Inside of him said why have you come here before my time in other words but remember what did Jesus Jesus didn't preach him a sermon Legion said in other words I want him to leave what Jesus say go go and it was that he preached sermon and say I am the Son of God he said go why because his authority was there he was speaking to that thing that when what happened to Legion just as soon as those demons were cast out of Legion we know where they went but the Bible says that he was naked at one time but he put his clothes on and it was in his right mind he started going to church praise God it's a journey we all need to identify

Water by the word so we're going to wash as we go to school you're going to be washed by God nobody else is going to know it you're going to be on your own not your own little world but you're going to be in your own time with God because you've connected with him and he's I'll be with you he said I'll never leave you or forsake you didn't say well now I'll wait till the second period in school
