[0:25] that what God give you is yours no
[0:29] nobody can take it away he says this
[0:32] salvation that I have is mine because
[0:35] God gave it to me and so everything that
[0:38] you desire from God is a gift when he
[0:41] give you that gift it's yours you don't

[11:15] name Amen brother K told me last Sunday
[11:19] he said I'm going to try to come back
[11:20] next week I said well if you do you have
[11:22] to put up with me because that was a you
[11:25] know fall in line okay John 14 now well
[11:27] familiar with us
[11:29] but we'll try to get a point in of
[11:32] something that I want you to see all
[11:34] right so let's read from John
[11:37] 14 1-
[11:40] 12 let not your heart be troubled you
[11:44] believe in God believe also in me in my
[11:46] father's house are many mansions if it
[11:48] were not so I would have told you I go
[11:51] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[11:53] and prepare a place for you I will come
[11:55] again and receive you unto myself that
[11:58] where I am there you may be also and
[12:01] whether I go you
[12:03] know and the way you know amen Thomas
[12:06] sayth unto him
[12:08] Lord we know not whether thou goest and
[12:11] how can we know the way Jesus sayth unto
[12:14] him I am the way the truth and the life
[12:17] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[12:20] now if you'll go that and take that word
[12:23] way I remember in the Baptist Church
[12:25] that struck me one day and I run as much
[12:29] as I could then back through C
[12:31] concordances that we had and look at the
[12:34] things that it talks about the way the
[12:36] way the way throughout the Old
[12:39] Testament and the children of Israel
[12:41] would be in the way you know they would
[12:43] be traveling all right go back and study
[12:45] that watch
[12:50] now if ye had known
[12:52] me now watch
[12:55] him you should let's go back Jesus said
[12:58] unto him I am the way the truth and the
[13:00] life no man cometh unto the father but
[13:02] by me if you had known me you should
[13:04] have known my father also and from
[13:06] henceforth you know him and have seen
[13:09] him now that's a great statement is it
[13:12] Philip saith unto him Lord show us the
[13:14] father and it suffice us Jesus Sith unto
[13:17] him have I been so long with you and yet
[13:21] hast thou not known me Phillip he that
[13:24] hath seen me hasth seen the father and
[13:27] how sayest thou then show us the father
[13:30] believest thou not that I am in the
[13:33] father and the father in me the words
[13:36] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[13:39] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[13:41] me he doeth The Works believe me that I
[13:46] am in the father and the father in me or
[13:49] else believe me for the very work sake
[13:52] verily verily I say unto thee he that
[13:56] believeth on me the works that I do do
[13:59] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[14:03] these shall he do because I go unto my
[14:07] father you may be seated the Lord at his
[14:10] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[14:12] you could take any Scripture there and
[14:15] preach the rest of the
[14:18] afternoon up on those things
[14:25] but you know we we spend a lot of time
[14:29] time in emphasis is made when you're
[14:32] reading that 12th
[14:34] verse and trying and Mankind has tried
[14:37] to figure
[14:38] out what Jesus was
[14:41] saying when he said that uh
[14:45] Greater
[14:47] Works than these shall
[14:50] ye you do Greater Works all right and
[14:55] then we we try to figure that
[14:57] out well I ran some things on it but I
[15:00] won't bring too much but a lot of people
[15:03] think that the Greater
[15:06] Works is said the man would say to
[15:09] brother Brandon one day said uh
[15:10] preaching the gospel is the Greater
[15:13] Works well
[15:16] now we know
[15:19] that naturally
[15:22] speaking intellectual
[15:25] speeches is not preaching the gospel
[15:28] right
[15:29] right it's supposed to be in power and
[15:31] demonstration of the Holy Spirit or the
[15:34] the message coming to you the truth
[15:35] coming to you and you're trying to speak
[15:38] that and see a lot of people then would
[15:41] try to justify that point of not being
[15:45] able to come up with the works maybe
[15:48] that Jesus did so they just take it to
[15:51] the basis of of preaching the gospel
[15:54] right all right you know they've got a
[15:56] truth in what they're saying
[15:59] but not the truth all right cuz there's
[16:02] a truth to preaching the
[16:05] gospel am do you know that there's one
[16:08] thing we can do that Jesus could not
[16:14] do you believe
[16:18] that do you know what it
[16:20] is the one thing we can do that Jesus
[16:23] couldn't
[16:25] do no well now he can do anything he's
[16:28] God okay now you're listening but we'll
[16:31] read them in just a minute you know that
[16:32] Jesus could not preach the baptism of
[16:34] the Holy
[16:36] Ghost God has not come
[16:39] yet we've emphasized back through there
[16:42] a lot that the Old Testament
[16:44] Saints wonderful they had the anointing
[16:47] of God you know of God with them the
[16:49] presence of God but they did not have
[16:51] the new birth right in the Old Testament
[16:55] now because the Bible says because Jesus
[16:57] had not been crucified the Holy Ghost
[16:59] did not come the scripture said all
[17:01] right so then they only had an
[17:04] anointing upon them but not a new birth
[17:08] because that would be the kingdom that
[17:11] Jesus spoke of that was there and would
[17:14] come into being all right but see to do
[17:17] the Greater
[17:19] Works but see we can we can uh try to
[17:22] justify ourselves and when we do we show
[17:25] our own stupidity mainly and and doing
[17:28] it
[17:29] but we'll say well well well we can't do
[17:31] what Jesus done so we'll we just make it
[17:35] as preaching the
[17:37] gospel well brother random said it like
[17:42] this he said
[17:44] okay let's see you do the lesser
[17:48] works and then he would talk about the
[17:50] Greater Works right all right now I'm
[17:54] trying to put something
[17:56] together to make a picture
[17:59] of what Jesus is
[18:01] saying that we know we can't do anything
[18:05] greater than he done because he died for
[18:08] our sins there's nobody can do that so
[18:11] the original translation comes out to be
[18:15] more more not greater it means more it
[18:20] just means more of it why because where
[18:24] he was in one person back there even
[18:28] though he was God himself but being one
[18:30] person he was limited to that all right
[18:33] then when it come over into the church
[18:35] now it's spread about the
[18:37] world right so the bride can do the
[18:41] Greater
[18:44] Works and I believe that I tried my best
[18:46] to emphasize that to
[18:48] you to to help us to
[18:52] understand that see Jesus said in these
[18:56] works you shall you do
[19:00] all right you know we should believe in
[19:04] Divine Healing we should believe in
[19:07] praying for the sick we should pray for
[19:10] the sick and we should expect to see uh
[19:13] things take place all right because
[19:18] Jesus said it right that we do these
[19:20] things but now remember get the point
[19:23] we're not trying to do anything greater
[19:24] cuz he died for our sins there's nothing
[19:26] greater than that right but it means
[19:28] more because there just more of it
[19:30] around the world now what have I tried
[19:32] to emphasize to you in the uh message
[19:38] that we were bringing about the
[19:40] Masterpiece family
[19:42] that were the grain of wheat that goes
[19:46] into the ground would have to return
[19:48] again in the end time in other words to
[19:51] bring about a Rapture all right and see
[19:54] it would be in you and I right okay but
[19:58] it would not be just us alone because we
[20:01] can't leave out what's back here behind
[20:04] us in the ages and the the ministers and
[20:07] thing and then claim to be built on
[20:10] something see we're supposed to be built
[20:12] on the foundation Apostles and Prophets
[20:14] Jesus Christ the KE Chief
[20:16] Cornerstone all
[20:18] right so then I've emphasized over and
[20:21] over to you
[20:24] Luther when he protested the Catholic
[20:27] Church they didn't get
[20:29] upset now listen what I'm
[20:32] saying it's when the
[20:34] people begin to take Luther's message
[20:38] right and protest the Catholic Church
[20:41] the Catholic Church got
[20:43] upset why because the people was doing
[20:46] it were just one by theel they just
[20:48] laughed him off that's right see then
[20:52] this message we
[20:53] believe is to be lived I believe every
[20:56] age had a message a
[20:59] messenger all right we put the emphasis
[21:01] on the messenger because thank God for
[21:03] the message that he brought all right if
[21:06] I'd have been in the days of Luther I
[21:08] would say the same thing thank God for
[21:10] the message that the messenger brought
[21:13] because it's the truth all right now but
[21:17] see something has got to be made real to
[21:19] you and I
[21:21] right and that's what Jesus was laying
[21:24] down the point because you can go
[21:27] through that John 14 in my father's
[21:30] house are many mansions you know many
[21:33] Souls many theophanies many people all
[21:36] then you could come on down to where he
[21:38] said that I go to prepare a place for
[21:40] you going on all the way to the Future
[21:42] home the statue of perfect man they
[21:44] going on all right but see it's got to
[21:47] be something
[21:49] personal now that's my whole point for
[21:52] for months and months and months is
[21:54] trying to get there for 40 something
[21:56] years CU this is what I was preaching in
[21:58] over 40 years ago that the bride would
[22:02] be the son of man 1969 the first message
[22:05] I preached that was the title The Bride
[22:07] would be the son of man in the end time
[22:09] and I believe that more today than I
[22:11] believed it in and I believe it was
[22:12] revealed in because it stood all these
[22:15] years in what I've tried to bring but
[22:18] see it's not just an end time people
[22:21] that's the son of man that's right you
[22:23] got to put all because in Revelations
[22:26] 1112 and 13 that's is one standing in
[22:29] the midst of the seven golden candles
[22:31] like unto the son of man which would
[22:33] take every age all the way
[22:36] through to make out what you're talking
[22:39] about and the prophet said she'd be the
[22:41] fullness of the godhead
[22:44] bodily but I just don't see it brother
[22:48] Dale but I guess that just aulls it
[22:51] don't
[22:52] it I mean the Bible said it the prophet
[22:55] said it cuz you don't believe it that
[22:57] aulls
[23:00] well that's pretty good isn't it I mean
[23:02] to think that one person could stand up
[23:05] and say I don't believe
[23:07] that and it just make it of no
[23:10] good well I don't give a hoot what you
[23:13] think that's right I
[23:15] believe 40 years ago I believed it and I
[23:18] still believe it more today than
[23:20] ever I thank God for the messenger I
[23:23] don't believe there anybody puts any
[23:24] more emphasis in the correct way about
[23:26] the prophet messenger
[23:28] cuz without him you and I wouldn't have
[23:29] nothing that's as plain as I can
[23:32] be it's not you that I'm following I'm
[23:35] following this message and I'm only
[23:37] following this message because this
[23:39] message brought Christ Paul said follow
[23:42] me as I follow
[23:44] Christ that don't make the messenger god
[23:48] right right we don't believe in that we
[23:51] don't believe in deities we believe in
[23:54] deity in the new
[23:56] birth I believe you have the new birth
[23:58] that's
[23:59] deity all right the prophet had the new
[24:03] birth that's deity right but outside of
[24:05] his gifts and things see that put him in
[24:07] a different category all right but the
[24:09] point that I'm trying to make
[24:12] is he
[24:14] said come on and do the lesser
[24:19] works well you know I'm honest I've
[24:22] tried to be I hope I
[24:24] am when Billy Graham was in where was it
[24:28] India or somewhere where he was at that
[24:30] time and you know they challenged
[24:33] him
[24:34] well you know he packed up and come
[24:38] home brother brandom said he should have
[24:41] called for somebody to come and stand
[24:45] there and called her hand he said maybe
[24:48] not the words but he said really he
[24:51] ordered done it
[24:53] himself cuz I believe God would have
[24:55] backed him up sir and he just stood
[24:58] there and said I don't have the signs
[25:01] and wonders in my Ministry but I believe
[25:03] it and I'm going to stand right here and
[25:06] declare Jesus Christ to you I believe
[25:10] God would have come on the
[25:13] scene well it's called what he believed
[25:16] all right and see why can't we be that
[25:19] way that's right to stand on what we
[25:22] believe right you know whether it's
[25:24] contrary what it is to anybody what does
[25:26] it make any difference
[25:28] I don't keep up with all this junk out
[25:30] in the world I'm not concerned with
[25:33] whether the Pope's coming to the United
[25:34] States next week or this week excuse me
[25:37] that that's going to be the great thing
[25:38] or the moon Tuesday supposed to go
[25:40] through all these stages that's all
[25:44] right but that ain't what I'm interested
[25:47] in I'm interested in God's
[25:51] word not whether Pope's coming or not
[25:54] it's what you and I can see and believe
[25:58] all right and see then I believe it that
[26:00] way
[26:01] yes but look what he said let's just get
[26:04] this if we don't get much we'll get this
[26:05] point go ahead brother uh I don't know
[26:08] who back C we get switched a lot of
[26:10] time it's on the message Jehovah Gyra
[26:14] 1961
[26:17] 3:12 and look what he says he said well
[26:20] Jesus said are greater than
[26:22] this you come do the works he done first
[26:27] then we'll talk about the
[26:29] greater and I will tell you what it is
[26:33] and going if you can do the works of
[26:35] Jesus then he's going to tell you what
[26:37] the Greater Works are right yes now see
[26:42] that's where people goes wrong I
[26:45] believe the ministry of Jesus
[26:48] Christ is in the world
[26:51] today if I didn't believe that I don't
[26:53] know what in the world I could
[26:55] believe and you tell me you don't
[26:57] believe it it's here like it was then
[26:59] I'll ask you to read one
[27:02] scripture for
[27:06] me you don't believe Jesus is here like
[27:08] he was in the days of the
[27:10] prophets you don't believe he was here
[27:12] he's here like he was in Jesus you don't
[27:15] believe he's here like he was in brother
[27:16] brandham I want you to read me one
[27:20] scripture I got a little message I'll
[27:22] come out of that with it but I'd like
[27:24] for you to read Hebrews
[27:26] 13:8 yes sir
[27:28] amen the same yesterday and maybe later
[27:36] on that's not exactly what it
[27:39] says when I just don't see it well what
[27:41] does that got to do with it amen that's
[27:44] right you realize the biggest portion of
[27:47] the world cannot see any form of you
[27:49] know the biggest portion cannot see any
[27:51] form of
[27:52] Christianity right and I don't mean
[27:55] because I can't see it people I mean
[27:57] there Buddha Hindu the world is
[27:59] populated today with all kind of they
[28:01] don't believe in Jesus Christ does that
[28:04] mean he didn't
[28:06] exist Does that mean that he's not here
[28:08] for you and I that's right because they
[28:11] believe it that way
[28:16] no but think about
[28:20] it I believe we've seen right here in
[28:23] this
[28:25] building the dead raised on on five or
[28:28] either six
[28:33] occasions we've seen the sick
[28:37] healed we've seen demons cast out we've
[28:40] seen all kind of things right here in
[28:41] this little building well I don't
[28:44] believe it cuz I don't see it well
[28:46] that's all
[28:49] right you know get up in the morning and
[28:51] say I don't believe a sun's coming
[28:55] up try it
[28:59] you know that's not going to hinder God
[29:01] he going to keep right on bringing
[29:04] it we've seen it here where the word has
[29:07] been spoken that rain would come and
[29:10] come the day we call for it you remember
[29:12] the day I stood here I said it won't
[29:14] rain until I call for
[29:17] it
[29:19] am came out here that day and I said it
[29:21] will rain now and the newspapers and
[29:23] Gainesville said it was the wetest
[29:25] September I believe August or September
[29:28] that they ever had on
[29:30] record I can stand and talk all day
[29:33] about the healings the signs and the
[29:35] things but what do
[29:38] we if we don't see something happen
[29:40] every day we get all
[29:43] excited I do too I want to see God
[29:46] manifest among
[29:49] us but I know also in the day and the
[29:52] time we're
[29:53] living it's a horrible thing Jesus face
[29:57] two
[29:59] denominations right Pharisees
[30:02] Sadducees and little herodians th
[30:06] in we
[30:08] Face 969 different they say one at
[30:12] 13,000 is what
[30:15] that Bishop guy said 13,000 different
[30:19] denominations there's about 25,000
[30:22] different ones in the
[30:25] message right amen and that's probably a
[30:28] low
[30:31] number see no wonder but that's no
[30:35] excuse for you and I I don't make
[30:37] excuses I make statements of
[30:42] truth but we've seen God do
[30:46] amen you come do the works he done
[30:54] first we've seen him do it right
[31:01] yes look at the next
[31:04] now he said I'll tell you in other words
[31:06] what the greater is what does he say you
[31:10] come to do it works he done we'll talk
[31:12] about the greater I'll tell you what it
[31:14] is what is the Greater Works Jesus could
[31:17] not preach the baptism of the Holy
[31:22] Ghost that's the one thing that God
[31:24] couldn't himself in human flesh could
[31:27] not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:29] he could preach about it he could preach
[31:32] that it was coming he could preach what
[31:34] it would be when it would get here he
[31:37] expound cuz that's what he
[31:38] done all
[31:41] right you remember brother BR said John
[31:44] preached justification he said Jesus
[31:47] preached
[31:48] sanctification amen you need that
[31:52] quote who's going to preach the baptism
[31:54] of the Holy Ghost the only ones that can
[31:56] pre preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:58] is the ones that's got the baptism of
[32:00] the Holy Ghost in
[32:02] them right right amen all right see then
[32:08] the Greater Works it's not just to
[32:11] preach I said that a minute ago was you
[32:13] listening it's not to make an
[32:15] intellectual
[32:20] speech see that's what they were saying
[32:22] brother brandom we preach the
[32:25] gospel he said let's you do this first
[32:29] yeah well all right we went through we
[32:32] see God has been with us all these years
[32:35] all
[32:38] right and the preaching of the
[32:42] Gospel not just preaching a sermon not
[32:45] going to church
[32:47] and just talking about something or Mak
[32:51] an intellectual
[32:52] speech but to
[32:55] preach even brother random was adamant
[32:57] enough to say the Bible doesn't say
[33:02] teach it says preach the gospel was he
[33:05] doing way with teachers no what the
[33:08] teacher supposed to
[33:12] preach if I don't have something from
[33:14] God to come out you and tell you we're
[33:16] going to play a tape or somebody else is
[33:19] going to
[33:20] preach
[33:22] why because we're not to play this games
[33:26] that's right that's right
[33:28] I I come out here with something in mind
[33:30] for you to see
[33:32] amen that's going to be very helpful
[33:34] somewhere down the
[33:36] road look what he says Jesus could not
[33:39] preach the baptism of the Holy
[33:42] Ghost it hasn't come yet that's the
[33:46] Greater Works we're doing but do the
[33:49] same Works he
[33:53] did if there's not signs following the
[33:57] believer he must not be a believer
[34:00] that's right is that
[34:03] sensible
[34:06] right and the Baptist Church I argued
[34:08] with him over that
[34:09] word I said it says he that believeth in
[34:12] his baptized she'll be saved it does not
[34:15] say he that
[34:16] believes he said he that
[34:19] believeth which means it continue Keep
[34:21] On
[34:23] Believing that's right Keep On Believing
[34:26] it that's right is that a deep horrible
[34:28] thing to
[34:31] understand I'm talking about Jesus
[34:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[34:37] forever look what he goes on to getting
[34:39] in the spirit
[34:40] 1961 almost the same thing but look what
[34:43] he
[34:44] says he's talking about the doing he
[34:47] says and you come here and do the lesser
[34:53] Works he said but ain't none of us can
[34:55] stand like he did
[35:01] or
[35:06] not why
[35:09] not no I can't say bring me 24 of your
[35:14] worst cases and I guarantee you healing
[35:16] for every one of them no I can't say
[35:20] that but I can sure lay my hands on you
[35:23] and pray for you and believe God to heal
[35:26] you
[35:29] amen
[35:32] right but that's maybe not for everybody
[35:34] brother around say he said it's not
[35:37] maybe for everybody to lay their hands
[35:38] on and feel the surge of God go through
[35:41] your body and see the person
[35:43] healed but that doesn't mean you don't
[35:45] have a work a part of
[35:48] it but look what he says here's a
[35:51] platform help yourself come up here and
[35:54] go down through this prayer line and and
[35:56] let the Holy Spirit move out in the
[35:59] audience there over you let me see you
[36:01] do them works and then go preach the
[36:04] gospel then you do do a greater works
[36:08] that's
[36:09] wonderful but you see you don't set in
[36:11] the place I'm
[36:12] in as I said about Billy Graham I'm not
[36:15] throwing off on
[36:17] him but what are you going to do
[36:21] here if some guy walks in with a gun I'm
[36:24] going to shoot you preacher unless you
[36:25] change what you believe
[36:31] or what if he comes in with a box in his
[36:35] hand and he says here's a snake let's
[36:37] see you handle it he said we don't play
[36:39] games brother no no we don't play games
[36:42] I shoot the
[36:45] snake no
[36:49] problems but you see I'm on the spot
[36:51] you're
[36:52] not you can get up and
[36:55] run
[36:57] you know what I've always said to you
[37:00] and I'm not arrogant hateful or mad at
[37:02] anybody or nothing just telling it like
[37:03] it is cuz way I've always
[37:06] been what if the Bible comes to truth it
[37:10] says that they
[37:12] come Brother Dean was on it the other
[37:15] day says they come and give you a
[37:18] sign and the sign comes to
[37:23] Pi why if somebody come in here and said
[37:26] okay
[37:27] there's a dead we're going to raise the
[37:29] dead and the dead
[37:31] raises what are you going to
[37:34] do but see you failing to get all the
[37:38] scripture he said and take you to
[37:40] another
[37:43] God you could roll 40 caskets in here of
[37:46] dead
[37:48] people and you say I'm going to prove to
[37:51] you the Trinity's
[37:53] right and the dead raised what are you
[37:56] going to do
[38:00] come on what are you going to do but I'm
[38:01] the guy that's hollered against that
[38:04] right I hope to the God's help that if
[38:07] the day ever comes that I'm challenged
[38:09] on what I believe about one God and the
[38:12] truth of this message that if I don't
[38:14] stand for it throw me out that door you
[38:17] don't have to vote me
[38:19] out throw me out of the
[38:22] door why because I'm not no good right
[38:27] I believe the same God is living
[38:31] today I believe in that we don't have to
[38:34] play games we're not a little side of
[38:37] the road church at this well we ain't
[38:40] seen God in a long time well you know
[38:43] why cause you're
[38:46] blind come
[38:48] on if you want a testimonial meeting

[38:53] day when the doctor told me he'd take my
[38:55] knap
[38:57] off 30 years
[39:01] ago you know what that would have meant
[39:03] that day still legged I looked him in
[39:06] the face I said you won't take my
[39:08] kneecap off he just looked me back and
[39:11] laughed and he said I will it's wore out
[39:14] I still got it he's
[39:19] dead when are we going to believe
[39:22] church what do we need to
[39:25] believe
[39:28] medically proven that my blood type was
[39:31] changed from positive a positive to a
[39:34] negative medically proven by the same
[39:38] doctors what do we
[39:43] need you see I'm trying to show you
[39:46] we've had the works of God Among
[39:48] Us and the Greater
[39:53] Works the Greater Works is to to preach
[39:56] the gospel in the truth
[40:01] Amen Let the Holy Ghost bring it in the
[40:04] truth look what he
[40:06] said Jesus could not preach the baptism
[40:09] of the Holy Ghost because it did not yet
[40:12] come that's a Greater Works it certainly
[40:15] is the church is to preach the baptism
[40:17] of the Holy Spirit Jesus said it was
[40:19] coming but your church has it and saying
[40:23] we got it and it's for you see and was a
[40:28] greater that is true
[40:31] amen what is the Greater Works is to
[40:34] preach Jesus Christ alive
[40:38] today amen not just a message to go to
[40:41] church and sit down and be
[40:43] good I hollered this 40 years ago I'm
[40:46] still hollering it
[40:50] today we've seen God manifest
[40:54] himself that's right and we seen people
[40:58] come that tried to change our Doctrine
[41:00] and couldn't succeed in
[41:03] it why because oh yeah I know what I'm
[41:05] just
[41:07] stubborn but come and show
[41:11] me come and show me anybody on the
[41:13] internet whatever come and show me where
[41:15] I'm off the message but yeah we don't
[41:17] want that that's an arrogant hateful old
[41:21] person we don't want that we'd rather
[41:24] have somebody that sets dates and and
[41:27] preaches all these false doctrines and
[41:29] all these bad ideas but they got a
[41:31] sweetness about them oh I just love to
[41:34] hear him he's just
[41:40] sweet sweetness ain't going to do you no
[41:42] good when you're in Hell looking
[41:45] up now brother Dale you're trying to
[41:47] send me to hell no uhuh I don't have
[41:49] anything to do with it you got to do
[41:50] with
[41:51] it right would you see what I'm talking
[41:55] about
[41:57] do you realize the importance of what we
[42:00] talk about in the
[42:05] scriptures and Jesus declared in what we
[42:09] read that he was the father right if
[42:14] youve seen me you've seen the father why
[42:16] ask to see the father you're looking at
[42:19] him he
[42:20] said and he said if you don't believe me
[42:22] believe the
[42:25] works
[42:27] you know what they wanted him to raise
[42:30] the dead and heal the sick they wanted
[42:32] him to feed everybody
[42:34] right but they didn't want him when he
[42:36] be to say I my father
[42:39] one when are we going to start saying I
[42:41] my father
[42:43] one come
[42:47] on you know I remember one day when a
[42:50] man raised from the
[42:52] dead and he was standing there and
[42:56] believe was Mary or one of them was
[42:57] brother Bob was on Wednesday really
[42:59] enjoyed the message we seen God come
[43:02] behind and fulfill his
[43:08] word but one of them said you know
[43:10] talking to
[43:12] Jesus he said go tell my
[43:16] disciples I'll go before you into
[43:19] Jerusalem but said tell them and what
[43:22] did he say tell
[43:25] them tell them that I
[43:27] go to my
[43:30] father oh that's
[43:32] good but that ain't all the
[43:36] scripture he said tell them I go to my
[43:38] father and your
[43:42] father you know what we got the same
[43:46] father right amen he said unto my
[43:53] God and your God we got the same God
[43:57] that's
[44:01] right well I just don't see it that's
[44:05] John 20 and 17 if you want
[44:09] to the Bible said you
[44:12] believe to see didn't say you see to
[44:16] believe if you see it it's a scientific
[44:20] fact I just believe he's the same all
[44:23] right now listen here's the point I want
[44:26] to get if we have the new birth if we
[44:30] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[44:32] can preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:34] that's right if you're born again you
[44:37] can tell somebody how you got born
[44:41] again and you know yourself that for 40
[44:43] something years I've always hollered one
[44:45] thing I'm a firm believer in
[44:48] justification yes sir amen
[44:51] sanctification and the baptism of the
[44:53] Holy Ghost amen
[44:57] I've always hollered and screamed
[44:59] against people that say I believe
[45:02] brother brandham was a prophet so that
[45:04] means I got to be saved well the devil
[45:07] beat you
[45:10] there he heard the
[45:13] prophet what about all of these in the
[45:16] message that swore by him when he was
[45:20] here where are they today click on the
[45:23] internet what is that thing believe the
[45:26] sign just go on click on your internet
[45:28] believe the sign and see how many
[45:30] preachers there are in this message that
[45:32] has turned against brother
[45:34] brandom big
[45:38] names boy they didn't do it while they
[45:40] was
[45:41] here they scared of it but see ain't
[45:44] here no more so they can say all they
[45:45] want
[45:47] to like we were talking this morning
[45:49] about certain brother had come in the
[45:51] kitchen his wife was speaking in tongues
[45:53] and he started laughing at her making
[45:55] fun of her
[45:57] I say he blasphemed the Holy
[45:59] Ghost do what you want
[46:02] to what else did he do right you mean
[46:06] laughing at somebody for speaking in
[46:08] tongues I've always told you don't make
[46:10] fun of nobody I don't care whether
[46:13] they're a Believer an unbeliever an
[46:14] idiot or whatever they are don't make
[46:16] fun of
[46:19] nobody that may be the Holy Ghost on
[46:21] that person to see what you'll
[46:24] do get off that get on your message okay
[46:27] thank
[46:29] you now if we have the same father if we
[46:33] have the same God what would be trouble
[46:35] of having the same
[46:38] Ministry amen amen
[46:42] right what's the
[46:45] problem same God same
[46:47] father what's the trouble we saying we
[46:49] have the same ministry that's you know
[46:52] but I just don't see it well I guess
[46:54] that means it is not in
[46:59] existence you ought to say as far as I'm
[47:02] concerned you remember brother brandham
[47:04] when they in Africa man wrote him said
[47:07] we don't want you over
[47:10] here we don't want you to come to
[47:13] Africa you know what he checked it out
[47:15] and found out it was one person
[47:19] yeah right but see when you put we it
[47:23] makes it look
[47:24] good that means there's a whole group of
[47:28] us just
[47:30] one what are
[47:32] we
[47:35] listen do you believe I'm just asking
[47:38] you the question simple question I'm
[47:40] always accused of being so deep and so
[47:42] out and all this that and the other I
[47:44] just ask you a simple question did Jesus
[47:47] Christ have a ministry
[47:51] right right right the sick was healed
[47:54] the dead was raised the demon were cast
[47:56] out the food was
[47:58] multiplied we had a fellowship meeting
[48:00] here or a meeting here one time a
[48:02] fellowship meeting and my Lord they
[48:04] piled
[48:06] in and somebody come to me and they said
[48:09] what in the world we going to do we
[48:10] can't even go buy
[48:12] stuff to feed this I said put it before
[48:15] the people there'll be plenty of
[48:20] it we fed twice as many as we normally
[48:23] fed and had food left
[48:28] come on I'm not bragging I'm telling the
[48:31] truth these things that I'm talking
[48:33] about is facts it's been here for all
[48:36] these
[48:37] years right right CU you see
[48:42] church I've taught you what I
[48:45] believe I believe around the world I
[48:49] don't believe no one person anymore has
[48:51] the
[48:52] message brother randam brought the
[48:54] message there's not another messenger of
[48:57] an eth day messenger or this kind of
[48:59] messenger or that kind of one there's
[49:01] not another Prophet to the
[49:06] Gentiles all right that's right but I
[49:09] believe that man had the ministry of
[49:12] Jesus
[49:13] Christ you
[49:15] agree but did it die when he
[49:21] died it's supposed to go in the
[49:24] bride
[49:27] and I've never Tau you that we're the
[49:28] only group that's got anything
[49:32] right but I've taught you and believe it
[49:35] that the ministry that was in brother
[49:37] brandom is in the bride around the
[49:42] world the ministry of Jesus Christ is in
[49:44] the bride around the
[49:47] world and if it's in a many membered
[49:49] body is not going to be in one little
[49:52] group we only have a part of that
[49:56] Ministry that's right but let's make our
[49:59] part
[50:00] right let's strive for whatever is in
[50:03] our
[50:06] part but when then when I'll read to you
[50:08] you know what most people say when you
[50:10] read to the same Ministry that Jesus
[50:12] Christ had is here yep yep I agree with
[50:14] that brother Dale same Ministry Jesus
[50:16] Christ is here it was in brother
[50:19] brandham well a got no problems I'll
[50:22] amen you but when you say it's not in
[50:25] anybody
[50:27] else I'm going to differ with
[50:31] you because if not then you're going to
[50:33] have all of God was he poured into
[50:34] Christ all Christ into brother Brown
[50:36] brother Brown died took it with him we
[50:37] ain't got
[50:38] nothing that's what people are
[50:42] saying
[50:45] right but
[50:48] listen look what he goes on to say look
[50:50] like brother R let's read a little bit I
[50:53] know we won't get finished on this but
[50:54] I'll do part of it look what he says on
[50:56] the message called the unconditional
[50:58] Covenant that God made with his people
[51:00] in
[51:02] 1954 now
[51:04] remember
[51:06] 1954 the seals were not
[51:10] opened right that
[51:15] 63
[51:18] 54 and look what he
[51:21] says
[51:23] E46 The Same Spirit that was on Jesus
[51:26] Christ has come back on his church doing
[51:30] the same signs the same wonders the same
[51:34] Holy Ghost the same power it's the
[51:37] Covenant that God has given to
[51:41] them listen Church why can't you believe
[51:43] the truth and
[51:46] listen brother Brown said he met people
[51:49] who had the Holy Ghost 50 years before
[51:52] him that had the same identical holy
[51:55] ghost that come on the day of
[51:59] Pentecost I sit with two brothers you
[52:02] know it one of them said I when I got
[52:05] born again I got every bit of this the
[52:07] whole stature of perfect man when I was
[52:09] born again the other one said when I got
[52:11] born again I never did even get in the
[52:13] pyramid I'm still down under here
[52:16] somewhere that's two preachers this
[52:19] message I said would y'all mind if I
[52:22] just try to stay in between yeah
[52:27] you know I said one of you going that
[52:29] way other going that do you mind if I
[52:31] just stay
[52:32] between well that was the topic came up
[52:34] you've heard me many times say where
[52:37] brother brandham they were quoting
[52:39] brother brandham where he's met with
[52:40] people with the same Holy
[52:43] Ghost I said you mind if I just Express
[52:46] something the day of Pentecost divided
[52:48] into two
[52:50] parts you got an upper room experience
[52:53] of
[52:54] 120
[52:56] then when they were born again they were
[52:58] right here where it says holy spirit
[53:01] they did not get the headstone now come
[53:02] on brother R said the head St ain't come
[53:04] yet so forget
[53:08] itl when I said on the day of Pentecost
[53:11] when the 3,000 outside they wasn't born
[53:13] again up here because they had not heard
[53:15] the word all they heard was one sermon
[53:18] and they got born again brought around
[53:20] read read the statue of perfect man he
[53:23] said you're born again at Faith
[53:26] then you advert your knowledge
[53:28] temperature why can't you see that so in
[53:32] 1954 the man is talking about the
[53:35] ministry of Jesus
[53:38] Christ look just like that he was here
[53:41] when he was leading
[53:46] Christ the same way the same Ministry
[53:49] Christ had in his church the same
[53:52] Ministry Christ had is in his church
[53:54] tonight
[53:55] same signs same wonders Same Spirit same
[53:58] kind of works that Jesus did here on
[54:01] Earth the church has to do the same
[54:03] thing if it's not it's not the Seed of
[54:08] Abraham
[54:10] oh it's not the Church of Jesus Christ
[54:14] can't

[56:16] out well that's pretty good when your
[56:18] wife will speak against
[56:21] you but

[57:11] States puts you in
[57:13] jail that's right we ain't going to put
[57:17] you in the Rapture it's only the reveal
[57:19] word Holy Ghost preached by ministers

[57:28] gospel well you're just you was an
[57:31] intellectual now you're arrogant well

[57:47] what you want
[57:48] to but is it the
[57:51] truth that's all I'm asking you look
[57:54] it'll be light in the evening time the
[57:56] holy spirit's here with the same
[57:58] Ministry that was delivered to
[58:01] the by the Lord Jesus Christ to his
[58:07] Apostles and she comes through a
[58:09] Darkness but the clouds are clearing
[58:12] back the same holy spirit is coming down
[58:15] and revealing the same thing God bless
[58:19] you why can't we believe
[58:23] it same as with give to the
[58:26] apostles Brother Gary asked me years ago
[58:29] he said brother Dale you believe
[58:31] that the faith of the fathers is
[58:35] here I didn't think no four hours and
[58:37] try to study it over I said yes
[58:41] sir you asked me today do you believe
[58:43] the ministry of Jesus Christ is here I
[58:46] wholeheartedly agree with
[58:49] iten it's around the world in The Bride
[58:51] of Jesus Christ
[58:53] amen
[58:57] M the same Ministry he had all the gifts
[59:01] that was in Jesus Christ is in the
[59:03] church amen right do we believe that all
[59:06] God was you put in Christ all Christ in
[59:07] the church and take her back to the
[59:08] Garden of Eden do we believe those
[59:10] things all right same Holy Spirit
[59:13] revealing the same thing you know put it
[59:16] page 45 is it 45 Christ M God reveal the
[59:19] Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the
[59:21] word you know that Jesus said even my
[59:24] only life did not reveal that unto
[59:27] thee right he said Flesh and Blood he
[59:29] can't do it it takes a holy ghost to
[59:32] reveal
[59:34] it you know what you can walk on a
[59:36] revelation you don't have to worry about
[59:40] it you can walk on Revelation I told my
[59:42] wife in the garden one day something had
[59:44] happened would happen and she said it'll
[59:46] never happen I said it'll either happen
[59:48] or I won't preach
[59:50] again she said you just quit
[59:53] preaching
[59:56] if she' had told me that I'd probably
[59:58] told her the same thing you know I don't
[59:59] mean about the preaching but because it
[1:00:02] was an impossible thing but you know
[1:00:04] what it come to
[1:00:06] P well why can't we believe in a God
[1:00:08] that lives why serve a God that's dead
[1:00:11] that you go see him on a on a Sundays in
[1:00:13] the
[1:00:14] church like a little boy you know sh
[1:00:17] we're going into God's house he's in
[1:00:21] here no I thought he lived in her heart
[1:00:25] all right same Ministry go ahead with
[1:00:28] number three Abraham's Covenant
[1:00:30] confirmed 1961 210 paragraph e
[1:00:36] 63 but the spirit that was in him he
[1:00:39] sent back down to the church so the
[1:00:42] church when this Covenant is brought
[1:00:44] into its full strength
[1:00:48] okay this is before the seals broke he's
[1:00:51] talking about the ministry of Jesus
[1:00:53] Christ he he comes after the seals
[1:00:55] breaks and talks about the ministry of
[1:00:56] Jesus
[1:00:58] Christ and that's exactly
[1:01:01] right why because it's coming to full
[1:01:04] strength when the Covenant is confirmed
[1:01:06] with God the church the people that goes
[1:01:08] into this body here to be his bride will
[1:01:11] be exactly the same spirit that was upon
[1:01:14] Christ doing the same thing the same
[1:01:16] Ministry the same power and it'll come
[1:01:19] together to be the word by word the same
[1:01:22] confirming the Covenant why can't we
[1:01:25] believe it
[1:01:26] church I
[1:01:28] mean I'm sorry for my actions and
[1:01:31] reactions and my hatefulness and
[1:01:33] hollering and screaming at you but
[1:01:36] there's one thing about it brother Brown
[1:01:37] made this statement one day and I
[1:01:38] thought that's a good one I'll hold on
[1:01:40] to
[1:01:40] it he said if you make it real soft the
[1:01:43] people are think you're trying to pull
[1:01:44] something over
[1:01:46] on that's what he said he said just lay
[1:01:51] it out
[1:01:52] there if you going to believe in Hebrews
[1:01:55] 138 how are you going to believe
[1:01:57] it okay here I'm not too good here what
[1:02:00] are you going to believe look at the
[1:02:02] next one
[1:02:06] perseverance preach in 19 and
[1:02:11] 62 wait wa on four that be
[1:02:15] number excuse me
[1:02:20] three I've lost it here we go this is
[1:02:25] the Mighty God unveil I turned the pages
[1:02:27] too far okay number four the
[1:02:30] perseverance we'll go with that one
[1:02:32] because it's in in here but look what he
[1:02:34] says on perseverance 62 so the church
[1:02:37] now if the headstone comes in Luther's
[1:02:40] time now watch
[1:02:43] him if the headstone come in Luther's
[1:02:47] time look what a out of the way place it
[1:02:51] would have
[1:02:52] been so it didn't come in Luther's time
[1:02:55] the Holy Ghost came
[1:02:57] right look if it come in Wesley's time
[1:03:01] it's got it'll come in its own
[1:03:04] predestinated
[1:03:06] time but the church will be honed in
[1:03:09] such a condition until the church's
[1:03:12] ministry will be so close and be just
[1:03:15] exactly the same kind of ministry that
[1:03:17] Jesus had to make it all fit together in
[1:03:20] the Rapture amen think about it amen
[1:03:25] all right go to number four and let's
[1:03:27] just pick out one I invite you to do one
[1:03:29] thing when you go home some of you
[1:03:30] especially ministers and the thing and
[1:03:32] just run in same
[1:03:34] Ministry and read all the
[1:03:37] things you'll
[1:03:40] find 60 70 80 times right around speaks
[1:03:44] of the same
[1:03:46] Ministry all right I just picked these
[1:03:48] as some that would be so go ahead
[1:03:51] paragraph 159 roll it on up now this is
[1:03:53] after the seal break so now we're on the
[1:03:55] other side of
[1:03:56] it and now it's right to bring him back
[1:03:59] exactly like he was at the beginning his
[1:04:02] same Ministry the same Jesus the Same
[1:04:05] power the same Holy Ghost the same one
[1:04:08] that come down on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:10] is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested
[1:04:13] today from Glory under glory to glory
[1:04:17] and it's back to its original seed now
[1:04:19] you remember all we went through with
[1:04:21] the original seed with the baptism of
[1:04:23] the Holy Ghost those with the same signs
[1:04:25] same wonders same baptism same kind of
[1:04:28] people acting the same way with the same
[1:04:30] power the same Sensations it's from
[1:04:33] Glory under glory and the next will be
[1:04:35] changed from this Glory into a body like
[1:04:38] his own glorious body and we shall see
[1:04:42] him Abraham all the
[1:04:45] same think about
[1:04:48] it look at number five look at modern
[1:04:51] events made clear by
[1:04:53] prophecy
[1:04:55] paragraph
[1:04:56] 263 when he begins to reveal himself
[1:04:58] into the seed form
[1:05:01] again now where's that at we've been
[1:05:03] ringing it
[1:05:04] down in the end time the same one that
[1:05:07] went into the ground come back to be the
[1:05:11] bride that's what he's saying
[1:05:15] am just the bride and the groom it's the
[1:05:19] same Flesh and Blood the same Ministry
[1:05:22] and the same things doing just exactly
[1:05:24] what he
[1:05:26] done why can't we believe it
[1:05:31] Church look at the next
[1:05:33] one number six which is a message called
[1:05:36] Luke
[1:05:37] 63428 now these are like I said are all
[1:05:39] after the seals BR so evidently had the
[1:05:41] same idea and there that bride is
[1:05:45] looking to the coming of the Lord
[1:05:48] Jesus which that secret secret coming of
[1:05:51] Christ she'll come and catch away his
[1:05:53] bride and in the
[1:05:54] night like a book I read of Romeo and
[1:05:57] Juliet one time how he come with a lad
[1:06:00] and got his bride out among them that's
[1:06:02] what Jesus will
[1:06:04] come someday and looking for that
[1:06:09] one is not looking to his
[1:06:13] Creeds but looking to Christ waiting for
[1:06:17] him to come with his heart centered go
[1:06:20] on up now blood relation to Isaac and
[1:06:23] thing
[1:06:24] what by the word working through the
[1:06:27] same thing carrying out the same
[1:06:29] Ministry he
[1:06:33] had the same
[1:06:37] Ministry that Jesus Christ
[1:06:41] had is in his
[1:06:43] bride because where's Hebrews
[1:06:48] 138 right if he's the same yesterday
[1:06:50] today and forever now brother Brown said
[1:06:52] it like this he said now he's a same he
[1:06:55] said I didn't say the church didn't
[1:06:56] change right go we're human beings and
[1:06:59] things you know and and you didn't have
[1:07:01] the full ministry of Christ in Luther
[1:07:03] and Wesley and them right we know that
[1:07:06] but you had the ministry of the hour
[1:07:08] that they lived that was all they was
[1:07:10] responsible
[1:07:14] for the same Ministry but do you believe
[1:07:18] it what do we doing Church what's the
[1:07:21] whole
[1:07:22] thing of going to
[1:07:24] church and trying to be good I thought
[1:07:28] we got out of that
[1:07:31] right come on we went to church and
[1:07:35] denominations and we sat around and
[1:07:37] talked about a God that used to be
[1:07:43] right now am I right that's right we
[1:07:47] what do they do now a God that used to
[1:07:49] be William
[1:07:52] brandham we you know what we back here
[1:07:54] in b m we talking about a truth cuz
[1:07:56] there was a God that used to be he was
[1:07:59] back there but we just didn't believe
[1:08:00] him to be alive now we're believeing the
[1:08:04] god of William brandom but I'm like
[1:08:09] Elisha you remember Elisha
[1:08:12] y the guy that said hey I want your
[1:08:16] robe y y remember Elijah passed his robe
[1:08:23] down to Elisha
[1:08:25] Elijah done eight four Miracles Elisha
[1:08:27] done eight right double
[1:08:31] portion but he comes the Jordan he goes
[1:08:34] in with Elijah Elijah's
[1:08:39] gone and he comes
[1:08:41] back and he takes that mantle and he
[1:08:44] smites the water and he said where be
[1:08:46] the god of Elijah that's right amen
[1:08:49] water is parted
[1:08:51] amen I've taught you that ever since
[1:08:53] since I've been around because that's
[1:08:55] not what we think Elisha wasn't doubting
[1:08:59] or trying to
[1:09:01] find read your commentaries even on that
[1:09:04] scripture read your origional
[1:09:05] translations on that
[1:09:07] scripture it give you some sense
[1:09:10] anyway Elisha wasn't saying well I don't
[1:09:14] know but where's the god of Elijah I
[1:09:17] don't see him
[1:09:19] no he smoked that water and he said PL
[1:09:26] language that water parted with
[1:09:29] Elijah right I've got his manle right
[1:09:34] he's gave me the double
[1:09:36] portion you remember that's what he
[1:09:39] got he said if he's in him he's in me
[1:09:42] part right that wasn't a question where
[1:09:46] be the god of
[1:09:47] Elijah that was a
[1:09:50] statement a statement of if God is with
[1:09:53] a
[1:09:54] he's here now
[1:09:57] amen if God was in Jesus
[1:10:00] Christ he's here now if God was in
[1:10:03] William Brown he's here
[1:10:10] now you see what we make ourselves
[1:10:13] unbelievers we make ourselves doubters
[1:10:15] and little
[1:10:18] sissified
[1:10:20] babies
[1:10:22] crying I don't see
[1:10:25] it if I could see it I'd believe it if
[1:10:29] you'd believe you could see
[1:10:34] it that's why I don't back up from
[1:10:38] nothing if that's arrogant and hateful
[1:10:40] leave me alone I'm happy this
[1:10:44] way cuz I stood for 40 something years
[1:10:47] and declared this message and declared
[1:10:49] it then and declaring it
[1:10:51] now prise God
[1:10:54] I'm not looking to try to find the god
[1:10:56] of
[1:10:58] Elijah I know where he's at he's in his
[1:11:02] bride around the
[1:11:04] world manifesting
[1:11:07] himself and you know being in the bride
[1:11:09] he can be right over there that
[1:11:10] denominational church too you
[1:11:14] know
[1:11:16] right you know Out Among the
[1:11:18] denominations now the dead are being
[1:11:20] raised the sick are being healed and we
[1:11:22] s around our own see nothing they got
[1:11:25] more than what we
[1:11:27] got you know why because of
[1:11:31] you and your
[1:11:33] unbelief remember Jesus was almighty God
[1:11:38] you
[1:11:39] agree but you know in the Bible it said
[1:11:41] he had to leave a
[1:11:45] city right that's right Jesus had to
[1:11:47] leave a city because their unbelief
[1:11:50] would not allow him to work that's right

[1:19:00] him like brother Dan was talking about
[1:19:02] Wednesday I believe in confessing my
[1:19:04] healing not begging God to heal me
[1:19:08] that's not in scriptures for you to beg
[1:19:09] God it's in the scriptures for you to
[1:19:11] take What God Says and stand on it and
[1:19:14] say by Stripes I'm
[1:19:18] Healed you know I told a man as a man
[1:19:21] told me one time he said
[1:19:23] where the Bible there says command ye me
[1:19:25] and this man come on musicians this man
[1:19:27] he told me he said I've quit trying to
[1:19:31] cast out the devil said I'm working on
[1:19:32] commanding the Lord I said
[1:19:34] what Pentecostal preacher you know I
[1:19:37] said what he said I'm working on
[1:19:39] commanding the Lord said see there says
[1:19:41] command ye
[1:19:42] me I said that ain't what that
[1:19:46] means that means that you take him at
[1:19:48] his
[1:19:50] word I don't care if your wording says
[1:19:52] command you don't command
[1:19:55] God you take him at his word and you say
[1:19:58] by his stripes I'm
[1:20:01] Healed and when you do you're
[1:20:05] delivered he said I don't care what I'm
[1:20:08] commanding the Lord I never talk to that
[1:20:12] guy
[1:20:14] anymore
[1:20:17] why you don't command God that's right
[1:20:20] but you believe him amen that's it you
[1:20:23] say by Stripes I'm Healed right the
[1:20:26] doctor says you got this Say by Stripes
[1:20:28] I'm
[1:20:33] Healed just confess yourself into
[1:20:37] it if nothing else let me die saying by
[1:20:40] Stripes I'm
[1:20:42] Healed I sure ain't wanting to just say
[1:20:45] well I know you know these people that
[1:20:47] got cancer first off they start out by
[1:20:50] saying by Stripes I'm Healed by stripes
[1:20:52] I'm Healed I believe God healed me after
[1:20:55] a while they kind of break down and
[1:20:57] they'll start saying well
[1:20:58] now maybe I've got it but I'm still
[1:21:00] saying by Stripes I'm Healed they first
[1:21:03] said don't have it you know
[1:21:05] don't words you
[1:21:07] know and then they'll wind up saying
[1:21:10] well maybe maybe God wants me to have
[1:21:12] cancer where they can treat me and find
[1:21:15] some way to cure
[1:21:18] cancer come on folks you're breaking
[1:21:21] down you're trying to prop up
[1:21:25] something just say by Stripes I'm
[1:21:29] healed amen and if I die don't put it on
[1:21:32] my Tombstone I died with
[1:21:35] that that's right why because I believe
