[26:42] james 1
[26:45] and then we'll go to first peter 1
[26:48] and then verse 1 peter
[26:50] 4. and try to continue our thought on
[26:53] that we were on this morning
[26:55] and pray that the lord would be with
[26:57] each one remember brother dean is sick
[26:59] pray for him
[27:00] and brother gary got to feeling better
[27:02] and coming in this evening
[27:04] we appreciate that
[27:06] now remember that next weekend the lord
[27:08] willing brother william
[27:12] borland
[27:14] i'm getting i may get these names one of
[27:16] these days to pronounce them
[27:18] sister monica's brother so we
[27:20] looking forward to hearing him never
[27:22] heard him minister
[27:23] and then brother tom ernest will be
[27:26] taking the evening service so remember
[27:28] these
[27:30] you know you know
[27:31] i haven't received any comment
[27:35] about the fourth of july weekend
[27:37] so you know we'll
[27:40] do whatever
[27:41] and uh
[27:43] you know
[27:44] because i told you we could have the
[27:45] saturday
[27:47] and we're going to have saturday night
[27:49] bible study
[27:50] and sunday services so we can have
[27:52] saturday night bible study
[27:54] we can have the fish fry that afternoon
[27:57] and you know that way we'll have hot
[27:59] dogs and things for those that don't
[28:01] like fish
[28:02] and but i don't understand why anybody
[28:04] would like fish
[28:06] i mean that's like banana pudding
[28:09] why in the world wouldn't anybody like
[28:11] banana pudding
[28:12] and them dead ripens too you know i
[28:14] don't understand that but anyhow
[28:17] um
[28:19] you know
[28:20] so i guess it'd be left up to me to make
[28:22] the choice then
[28:23] if no comments and then everybody can
[28:25] blame me
[28:26] decide it wants it this way and blame it
[28:28] as i don't want to blame it so just
[28:30] blame me we'll have the
[28:32] fish fry on saturday afternoon
[28:36] we'll start at about somewhere around
[28:38] two o'clock cooking
[28:40] we'll eat somewhere in the neighborhood
[28:42] of
[28:43] 4 30
[28:44] 5 breaking 4 30
[28:47] and or 4 something whatever you come
[28:50] and then we'll have bibles we'll have
[28:52] the kids they can play and
[28:54] games and do things you know outside in
[28:56] the playgrounds and we'll have bible
[28:59] study
[29:00] saturday night then we'll have
[29:03] the sunday services regular
[29:05] all right
[29:06] and we are working on trying to get
[29:09] somebody to come in and minister for us
[29:11] so we don't know
[29:13] yet what will be
[29:14] but you just pray that the lord would
[29:16] bless each one of us
[29:18] and we'll do it that way and you that
[29:21] are from out of town that do not
[29:23] have a you know like if you have to come
[29:25] up saturday and go back
[29:27] if you'll let us know we will
[29:29] um you know
[29:30] supply you a place a
[29:32] house to stay in or something to do
[29:35] to where that you can spend saturday
[29:37] night with us
[29:38] some of us that you don't have to drive
[29:40] back
[29:41] you know and put a burden on you
[29:44] that is the reason that we do not do
[29:46] like a lot of other churches and have a
[29:48] lot of saturday night services because
[29:51] people having to drive so far and come
[29:54] back but
[29:55] you know um
[29:57] we started here july the 4th 1971
[30:00] and it'll be
[30:01] what 39 or 40 years 41 years how many
[30:04] years is it
[30:06] i can't count that five sir uh uh you go
[30:09] 40 what
[30:10] 43
[30:12] mr charlotte's over there counting i
[30:14] ain't i have to take my shoes off so yes
[30:16] to go above 10 so i can
[30:19] but we will be having that for that
[30:22] weekend
[30:24] and uh charlotte and richard can well
[30:26] remember that weekend
[30:28] because
[30:29] i think they were dating then
[30:32] you weren't married would you
[30:35] and they were sitting right out here
[30:37] on the side of the highway
[30:40] and uh that first service
[30:42] and they just for some reason decided to
[30:45] move
[30:46] and they went and drove around to
[30:48] somewhere else i don't really know where
[30:50] they parked
[30:51] but about the time that they finished
[30:54] the guy came down the road you all of
[30:56] you know
[30:57] and hit all five vehicles it was sitting
[31:00] outside out there if they had been
[31:02] sitting there
[31:03] it would have been very dangerous so the
[31:05] lord works things out and gets
[31:06] everything ready and makes it all work
[31:09] right so we appreciate the lord doing
[31:11] that all right so that's the way we will
[31:13] be doing if we can
[31:16] you know get a hold of somebody to come
[31:18] in i wanted brother fourny too but he
[31:20] didn't he's going somewhere else
[31:23] but we'll do something all right
[31:25] uh james
[31:26] 1
[31:28] and 1st peter 1 and then first peter 4.
[31:31] so remember that remember the fellowship
[31:32] meeting will be
[31:33] at brother
[31:35] pageants on the first or the third
[31:38] saturday in
[31:40] july so remember those things i guess
[31:42] that's all announcements
[31:44] all right
[31:45] now for the weekend there you will not
[31:47] have to be bringing nothing
[31:49] you know the july it will be done here
[31:52] by all
[31:53] of us you if you want to bring a cake
[31:56] we always love sweets
[31:59] you know if you want to help us make be
[32:01] fatter
[32:02] come ahead and do the best you can we'll
[32:05] we'll eat and have a good time okay
[32:07] father we thank you lord for your love
[32:09] and your grace unto us we thank you for
[32:11] calvary
[32:12] and we just ask you to help us guide us
[32:16] lord give us understanding ears that we
[32:18] may hear
[32:19] what you have to say unto each and every
[32:21] one of us
[32:23] forgive our sins and let us stand
[32:25] complete in you lord
[32:26] and in doing that then give us the
[32:28] opportunity to hear and we thank you you
[32:30] have
[32:32] we just asked you to open as we were
[32:33] singing the eyes of our understanding
[32:36] for our heart
[32:37] that we may be able to hear your word we
[32:40] love you and we thank you we commit it
[32:42] to you now in jesus name
[32:45] amen
[32:46] all right james
[32:49] remember we're talking about proving and
[32:51] trying and
[32:52] things so we go to james
[32:55] 1
[32:57] and we'll start reading it about verse
[32:59] 2.
[33:01] he said my brethren counted all joy
[33:04] when you fall into diverse temptations
[33:18] my brother encountered all joy when you
[33:20] fall into the diver's temptation knowing
[33:22] this that the trying of your faith
[33:25] worketh patience
[33:28] we let patients have our perfect work
[33:30] now if you want patience in the pyramid
[33:32] you work on some of that right
[33:35] but let patients have our perfect work
[33:38] that you may be perfect and entire
[33:40] wanting nothing
[33:42] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[33:44] god that give it to all men liberally
[33:46] and upbraideth
[33:47] not
[33:49] and it shall be given him but let him
[33:52] ask in faith
[33:54] nothing wavering
[33:57] for he that wavereth is like a wave the
[34:00] sea driven with the wind and tossed
[34:05] let not but for let not men think that
[34:07] he shall receive anything of the lord
[34:10] not that man what the waiver want watch
[34:12] this now the bible i love it because
[34:15] it makes a point a lot of times he will
[34:17] explain that
[34:19] see a double-minded man is unstable in
[34:21] all of his ways
[34:23] let the brother of low degree rejoice in
[34:26] that he is exalted
[34:28] but the rich and that he has made low
[34:31] it doesn't sound too good to rich man
[34:34] because as the flower to grace he shall
[34:36] pass away
[34:38] for the sun is no
[34:39] sooner risen than risen with a burning
[34:42] heat
[34:42] but it withers the grass and the flower
[34:44] thereof falleth and the grace of the
[34:46] fashion of it perishes for also shall so
[34:50] also shall the rich man fade away in his
[34:52] ways
[34:53] watch now blessed is the man that
[34:55] endureth temptation
[34:58] for when he's tried
[35:00] he shall receive the crown of life
[35:04] which the lord hath promised to them
[35:06] that love him
[35:08] now we'll get back to that at the last
[35:11] there's got to be trials before the
[35:14] promise
[35:16] can come
[35:17] the life's trial abraham had was
[35:20] take that boy
[35:22] your only hopes up there and kill him
[35:26] now that was pretty hard with it
[35:29] now watch is where we were this morning
[35:31] see let no man say when he is tempted i
[35:34] am tempted of god
[35:36] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[35:39] neither tempteth he any man
[35:43] but every man is tempted when he is
[35:45] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[35:48] then when lust hath conceived it
[35:50] bringeth forth sin and sin when it's
[35:51] finished
[35:52] bringeth forth death
[35:55] all right let's go over to peter
[35:58] 1
[36:00] and we'll go about verse 6.
[36:03] we're in you greatly rejoice
[36:06] though now for a season
[36:09] if need be
[36:10] you are in heaviness through manifold
[36:13] temptations
[36:14] that the trial of your faith being much
[36:16] more precious than of gold that
[36:18] perisheth
[36:19] though it be tried with fire
[36:21] might be found unto praise and honor and
[36:24] glory were
[36:26] at the appearing of jesus christ 4
[36:31] 412
[36:34] beloved think it not strange concerning
[36:36] the fiery trial which is to try you as
[36:38] though some strange thing happened unto
[36:40] you
[36:41] but rejoice
[36:43] in as much as ye are partakers of
[36:45] christ's sufferings
[36:47] that when his glory shall be revealed
[36:50] you may be glad also with exceeding joy
[36:54] if you be reproached for the name of
[36:56] christ now watch these two
[36:59] if you be reproached
[37:01] for the name of christ
[37:03] if you're tested right
[37:05] happy are ye
[37:06] for the spirit of glory and god rested
[37:08] upon you
[37:10] on their part he is evil spoken of but
[37:12] on your part he's glorified
[37:14] now once
[37:16] now here's where you difference between
[37:17] the test and the temptation
[37:22] you remember satan tempts god test
[37:26] attempt is to kind of provoke you to
[37:29] to
[37:30] you know do different than
[37:31] the test is just a trial
[37:35] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[37:38] now why would he go putting that in the
[37:39] scriptures
[37:42] don't not even be thinking about it
[37:44] well see if you go out and do a murder
[37:46] and they arrest you they ought to
[37:49] you see what he's saying
[37:51] let none of you suffer as a murderer boy
[37:53] they really
[37:55] they really done me dirty i killed that
[37:56] guy and they put me in jail
[38:00] well that's really something that
[38:02] you're really being tempted ain't you
[38:04] you're really being tested no that's
[38:06] what he's explaining
[38:08] verse 14
[38:10] if you re reproach for the name of
[38:12] christ
[38:14] that can go into the tempting but if
[38:16] you've done your own you've done being
[38:18] as we read while ago led astray of your
[38:20] own lust and murdered
[38:23] that none of your suffer is a murderer
[38:24] as a thief as any of you will do her or
[38:27] is it busy body and other means matters
[38:30] yet if any man suffer as a christian
[38:33] let him not be
[38:34] not be ashamed
[38:37] but let him glorify god
[38:40] on this behalf you may be seated the
[38:42] lord at his blessing
[38:43] to the reading of the word now to try to
[38:47] carry on the thought and
[38:50] of what we were bringing this morning
[38:54] remember the difference between a test
[38:58] and a temptation because god can't tempt
[39:00] anybody
[39:01] and he can't be tempted
[39:04] all right
[39:06] the the tempting is as we said on like
[39:09] the order of
[39:12] laying something down
[39:15] and
[39:16] waiting on you to reach over and pick it
[39:18] up
[39:19] and as quick as you pick it up
[39:21] whamo you're in jail
[39:25] that is tempting and that's not even
[39:27] right according to the law
[39:29] all right you have to give the man the
[39:31] right to
[39:32] decide what to do with a bundle of money
[39:35] before you could arrest him of course
[39:37] they don't do it but that's the way it
[39:39] is
[39:40] and you're enticing emcee
[39:42] and those are not illegal even according
[39:44] to the law
[39:46] but then the test of a christian
[39:49] that is ending up talking about that
[39:51] maybe you have in your life something
[39:53] that you can remember that
[39:57] something happened and you was put forth
[39:59] as a trial there and
[40:01] and you uh
[40:04] you either failed or
[40:06] passed the test
[40:08] and remember our old way of saying
[40:10] things if you got a test
[40:12] you know
[40:14] and you fail it
[40:15] it's going to come back around
[40:18] right you know it's kind of got a way of
[40:20] working it's their way around
[40:22] and you're going to come back to that
[40:24] test
[40:25] but remember that part now remember what
[40:27] we were talking about this morning
[40:30] that as we read in the scripture
[40:34] that
[40:36] god cannot tempt you
[40:40] see and then condemn you
[40:44] he can permit things to
[40:47] work
[40:49] allowing it to come in your way
[40:51] but remember the difference between the
[40:53] point of
[40:54] saying that you're led away of your own
[40:56] lust
[40:59] that means that when it's first put
[41:01] there it's not too bad
[41:03] but then when you yield to that then you
[41:06] go into that
[41:07] and there is the tempting that comes
[41:10] all right
[41:12] do you remember this quote we gave from
[41:15] i know where brother branham says
[41:18] there's nothing can happen to you
[41:21] unless god permits it
[41:25] all right
[41:28] he said to satan when he
[41:31] you know
[41:32] said you considered my servant job said
[41:34] he's perfect upright
[41:36] oh he's out of way because you've got a
[41:37] hedge built around him you know you're
[41:39] just taking care of it he's your prized
[41:41] little kiddo you know he's your little
[41:43] child and
[41:44] you uh
[41:45] you just petting him
[41:47] he's your great-grandchild
[41:49] that'd have been a better way of saying
[41:50] it wouldn't it
[41:51] you know what i mean by that was the
[41:53] brother richard and i were talking
[41:54] wiltshire tying up were talking this
[41:55] morning about
[41:57] you know them the kids they didn't get
[41:58] to bounce on the bed uh-uh they whooped
[42:02] the grandkids got to bounce on the bed
[42:04] you know
[42:05] well the great grandkids they just
[42:07] bounce anywhere they want to
[42:09] yo we just keep losing it you know right
[42:14] and
[42:14] uh
[42:16] but we think that's the way god does but
[42:18] remember he doesn't have any
[42:19] grandchildren
[42:20] he's got sons and daughters and sons and
[42:23] daughters must be tested and tried
[42:25] according to the scripture
[42:27] and it's for our
[42:28] benefit was it for job's benefit
[42:33] or was it for god's benefit job's
[42:35] benefit
[42:37] why
[42:37] god knew what job was going to do
[42:41] but he was proud to
[42:42] let him be put to a test
[42:45] to worry that he could come forth and
[42:47] then after he came forth
[42:49] then job come to a point
[42:52] to where
[42:53] and i'll try to get to that minute in
[42:55] the message then job came to the point
[42:57] he said
[42:58] i know my redeemer liveth
[43:01] in the last days he'll stand up on the
[43:03] earth and i'll see him for myself
[43:06] he come to appoint
[43:08] the in his test
[43:10] that he passed the test
[43:13] once he passed the test
[43:15] there it is but that's what now the
[43:16] point i want to get if you don't get
[43:18] nothing out of the message today
[43:20] i want to ask you the question
[43:24] when a test is being brought
[43:27] we'll use job as an example
[43:31] as it was being tested
[43:34] you know
[43:35] on all the things happening
[43:39] where was god
[43:49] i believe we'll prove by the bible and
[43:51] word of god the prophet's message
[43:56] that god was more on the scene
[43:59] here with job
[44:02] than he'd ever been
[44:06] it doesn't look that way does it
[44:09] it looks like god just turned his back
[44:10] and walked away for satan get after him
[44:14] no
[44:16] you know the tests and the trials of
[44:20] job brought god out of heaven
[44:25] right
[44:29] come on am i right
[44:31] i was up in heaven when they were
[44:32] talking
[44:33] he allowed the devil to go down and get
[44:35] started on him and
[44:36] god just pulled himself up and pulled
[44:38] his fingers
[44:41] brother and made a statement i remember
[44:42] when i first heard it
[44:46] he said god
[44:48] came down in all of the horrible things
[44:51] israel done
[44:53] and said he visited himself like a
[44:55] father
[44:56] with his family
[44:59] amen and all of the things that they'd
[45:01] done wrong he was right there with him
[45:04] not gone off somewhere else
[45:06] so if you don't get nothing from the
[45:07] message get the point
[45:10] trials and tests brings god to you
[45:13] doesn't drive him away from
[45:16] you if we don't take them correctly
[45:21] we drive him away from us
[45:26] right
[45:30] so consider that now
[45:34] all right so we gave what the prophet
[45:35] said off of god in his own words that
[45:38] god can't tempt us
[45:40] he tries us and tests us
[45:42] he cannot tempt us
[45:44] but he can test us
[45:47] and all people but all children
[45:50] must go through that
[45:53] child training
[45:56] child training
[45:58] you give kids everything in the world
[46:00] spoiled brat
[46:03] you make them work for it
[46:06] they won't like you
[46:09] you know
[46:11] because they say my buddy he's got a car
[46:13] and he didn't work
[46:15] you want me to cut grass
[46:20] there was never no choice at home
[46:22] whether the kids done what
[46:25] they didn't have much right to argue
[46:26] back
[46:28] it was either done or
[46:31] consequences
[46:33] well
[46:34] i hope that's god's way of doing things
[46:37] a lot of time
[46:39] but now think about it
[46:43] a test or a trial
[46:46] is to bring you to a place
[46:49] that god can move on the scene
[46:52] in your life
[46:58] that doesn't sound sensible does it
[47:02] this to the human thinking they don't
[47:04] sound right does it
[47:06] we think oh we poured all his blessings
[47:09] on us he showers us you know and
[47:12] you know he's real good
[47:14] how many of you remember in your life
[47:17] when you first became a christian
[47:21] and oh you just walked in a world and
[47:24] you could say daddy
[47:25] i need something
[47:27] and he just give it to you
[47:31] you know
[47:32] i need this he just poured out on you
[47:36] then one day you said he said daddy i
[47:38] need something
[47:40] and
[47:41] then you're looking for daddy
[47:43] because you're wondering where daddy's
[47:44] at
[47:46] but as he left you
[47:50] no
[47:51] he's more on the scene than ever before
[47:55] just remember what
[47:57] god told job
[48:01] you can do anything you want to to him
[48:04] but you can't touch his life
[48:07] you know in doing that he couldn't touch
[48:09] his wife
[48:10] there's no record that his wife went
[48:12] through anything
[48:16] but yet what did she wind up doing why
[48:18] don't you curse god and die
[48:22] you know
[48:24] he said you talk like a foolish woman
[48:31] but no problems to
[48:32] her looks like she'd have been more
[48:35] sympathetic is my point but get on with
[48:37] it
[48:39] god had confidence in job
[48:43] and by an infinite god he knew what job
[48:46] would do
[48:49] but he wanted job to find out what he'd
[48:51] do
[48:54] like i said one time about brother
[48:55] colley i said i'm going to get him in
[48:56] the biggest
[48:57] argument that's ever been with somebody
[48:59] i'm going back around the corner
[49:03] i'm gonna listen
[49:05] cause you know why because i want to
[49:07] know what's in him
[49:09] i want to see how he can handle it
[49:12] you know
[49:14] all right
[49:17] what about the things we go through so
[49:19] let's start where we kind of left off
[49:23] on
[49:24] this morning where we're there in the
[49:25] scripture where
[49:27] that
[49:28] in deuteronomy where that the
[49:32] worth it
[49:33] you know it says if a prophet comes
[49:35] or a dreamer of dreams you know
[49:38] and they give you a sign and it come to
[49:40] pass
[49:43] but said they take you to another god
[49:47] he said don't believe them i said
[49:49] because i have sent that person
[49:53] to prove you
[49:57] now how much more of a god should we
[49:59] love
[50:01] you know
[50:02] than to think about that he wants to
[50:03] train his children
[50:06] you know you brothers it was in the
[50:07] military you know you have to go through
[50:10] all these tests and trials they don't
[50:11] take you out the first day and say
[50:13] all right
[50:15] get up over that hurdle
[50:18] run us a good five miles with a 90-pound
[50:20] pack on your back
[50:23] no
[50:24] start out real slow and gradual
[50:26] but after a while you know what
[50:28] they're very proud to be able to stand
[50:31] the test
[50:32] but in the old days i don't know what it
[50:34] is now but i've saw movies heard stories
[50:37] and that's all i've been cause i've
[50:38] never been there but you know that old
[50:40] sergeant
[50:42] he was done so rough and tough until
[50:45] i remember seeing a movie one time when
[50:47] they were just all their tongues lolled
[50:48] out you know running with that 90 pound
[50:51] pack and here goes the sergeant running
[50:53] backwards
[50:55] with his own saying come on boys let's
[50:57] go
[50:59] well
[51:00] i've always said you know it takes an
[51:02] old tough sergeant
[51:04] to make something out of you
[51:06] and what's the rest of my story there
[51:09] that's when god made me tough and put me
[51:11] here
[51:12] work do a little child training and
[51:14] sometimes i have to run backwards
[51:17] to let you know that we're still here
[51:20] all right sometimes i have to correct
[51:24] i don't like
[51:25] being what i am but i am what i am but
[51:28] let's get started
[51:30] maybe i'm put here for your test
[51:35] you know
[51:37] maybe i'm put here to put you through
[51:40] the test
[51:42] maybe i'm put here to be your tempter
[51:44] you know
[51:46] you get in the test
[51:48] it's all right
[51:51] look what he goes on let's get a few
[51:52] things and get started let's go to
[51:54] to number seven brother joe and
[51:57] we'll start with hebrews chapter four
[51:59] and i know bob's back there or
[52:01] somebody's there i always just
[52:03] you know brother anderson he's in
[52:05] california i hope he's watching in today
[52:08] and we say hi to him because he's there
[52:10] in california on his job
[52:13] but look where we kind of left off we
[52:14] had read this or part of it
[52:18] it's all for the hebrew book and brother
[52:20] branham says
[52:21] they got weary every time
[52:24] they'd get in the place where a showdown
[52:25] come
[52:27] then what would they do they'd fly loose
[52:29] and get weary and want to turn back and
[52:32] why did this happen to me
[52:35] you know
[52:37] you know what he's referring to the
[52:38] children of israel they were brought out
[52:40] of egypt and the different things you
[52:42] know and and all and and then when they
[52:45] get to gripping and complaining i
[52:47] remember one time they're in the bible
[52:49] it says
[52:50] that they were scrapping ten times
[52:53] from the time they left to the way to
[52:54] get to what katie's barney i believe
[52:56] they cropped ten times but you know each
[52:58] time in that i'll turn out to complain
[53:00] and god said come on let's go
[53:02] okay i'll kill a few of you come on
[53:03] let's go we'll get rid of this scum okay
[53:06] let's go
[53:07] we'll get rid of them worse complainers
[53:09] and gripers but let's go he was had them
[53:11] on the way to the promised land but when
[53:13] i got at cadiz barnea
[53:15] and turned down the fact that he said
[53:17] that land is there in front of you
[53:20] i've shown it to you i've given you
[53:22] witness of it these twelve have brought
[53:24] it back it's their land of milk and
[53:27] honey and they said we can't take it
[53:29] they started doubting god's word it
[53:32] wasn't just a sin
[53:35] now i know you
[53:37] don't like me the way i talk
[53:39] but you know god's not too much
[53:43] in a pity party pattern with all of us
[53:45] to where because he knows that we're
[53:47] going to do things
[53:50] right
[53:51] now quote your prophet he said i sin
[53:53] every day
[53:57] do you have to no
[53:59] are we yes
[54:02] well you know god just don't beat on
[54:03] that too heavily
[54:07] right
[54:08] i mean am i honest is that the truth
[54:12] ten times for the children of israel
[54:14] right and complain
[54:16] they're still on the way to the promised
[54:17] land but when they come and they doubted
[54:19] god's word
[54:21] that they was able to do it
[54:23] you ain't going now
[54:25] right
[54:28] don't you think that's where we're
[54:29] standing
[54:31] he's put up with us all these years and
[54:33] little pity patters and up and down and
[54:35] around horeb and fighting and fussing
[54:37] and two souls two lords and bruises and
[54:40] souls
[54:43] about time for us to cross over
[54:50] let's just don't doubt god's word
[54:53] remember
[54:55] i thought
[54:57] i'm honest now
[54:59] i thought we believed
[55:01] not that brother branham was infallible
[55:04] no
[55:06] not that he was deity no
[55:10] but i thought and and we know that the
[55:12] human element of the man made mistakes
[55:15] i was just quoting him and saying with
[55:17] his sins every day
[55:22] but the message the man brought
[55:27] is perfect amen
[55:31] where he would say 707 000
[55:36] that's human
[55:39] but the message is right
[55:41] right
[55:43] well then i thought we believed the
[55:45] message
[55:46] to be in the form of the spoken word
[55:50] that was coming from god to us in this
[55:54] day
[55:55] that would be the same to us and we
[55:57] would be judged by it
[55:59] as it would be the literal written words
[56:04] of days gone by
[56:09] then when i read to you in quoting that
[56:12] god doesn't tempt you
[56:15] he tries you
[56:16] but brother dale i think he tempts me
[56:19] where'd you get that thought from
[56:23] well the bible says over here and so and
[56:24] so i'm just going to go to that there's
[56:25] one
[56:27] you've got that all lined up wrong
[56:32] okay
[56:35] it's all lined up wrong because it can't
[56:37] fit what the prophet said and it can't
[56:39] fit what we just read the bible god
[56:41] don't tempt nobody
[56:46] but you can spend weeks
[56:47] reading and building you a great case
[56:51] as to try to prove a tempting
[56:58] you're right in the devil's playground
[57:00] go ahead and do it
[57:03] because if you're going to be anything
[57:04] in the word of god we're going to come
[57:05] back
[57:07] to hear
[57:09] and face god's word
[57:13] that's how serious i am
[57:15] i'm sorry if that's not your way
[57:18] but look
[57:20] we said people come along and say why
[57:21] did this happen to me
[57:24] and watch what he said
[57:26] same strange thing
[57:29] this morning after preaching that just
[57:31] as hard as i could
[57:36] there was many came to the altar and
[57:39] question it why did this happen to me
[57:42] you see how it goes it goes over the top
[57:45] of the people's head
[57:48] he says it's the same people
[57:50] went over back there over here
[57:53] all right
[57:57] you mean brother dale you put all your
[57:58] confidence in that point
[58:03] i put it there as much as i
[58:05] humanly can roll it on up let's read a
[58:07] little bit more
[58:11] you mustn't question anything to god
[58:16] why'd this happen to me
[58:20] oh but but brother dale i'm not
[58:22] questioning god i'm just making a
[58:25] statement
[58:26] well your statement is a question
[58:33] you can't say why did this happen to me
[58:35] and put up what do you call them dots on
[58:37] the end of it where you continue the
[58:39] sentence
[58:40] you've automatically made it a question
[58:42] so stop put the question
[58:45] just quit trying to be
[58:47] smart
[58:48] look you mustn't question anything to
[58:51] god
[58:54] yeah but i don't understand
[58:57] i've i've always been good i've always
[58:59] went to church i go to services every
[59:02] things i can
[59:03] but i'm sick
[59:05] god knows i want to be a church
[59:09] but i'm sick
[59:13] are you going to question god
[59:16] and every trial is put upon you
[59:19] to prove you
[59:21] the bible says
[59:25] they're more precious to you than gold
[59:30] a trial
[59:34] it's more precious than gold
[59:39] you're praying for your kids
[59:41] to be saved
[59:43] and you turn around and look at them and
[59:44] they're going the other way
[59:51] right
[59:57] sometimes it's hard to believe the truth
[1:00:03] it's not an easy pity pattern thing for
[1:00:05] to do it
[1:00:09] so if god let a few light afflictions
[1:00:11] happen to you
[1:00:13] remember
[1:00:14] it's for the correction of you
[1:00:20] every son that cometh god must be
[1:00:22] chastened of god
[1:00:24] must be must first be chastened of god
[1:00:26] and try tried child train
[1:00:29] there's no exceptions
[1:00:33] that leaves you a little pity petty case
[1:00:34] out
[1:00:35] that you think is so bad
[1:00:38] nobody's in problems like me
[1:00:41] boy
[1:00:46] every son that cometh to god
[1:00:49] there's afflictions are
[1:00:51] these afflictions are done are brought
[1:00:55] brought about to see what attitude
[1:00:58] you'll take
[1:01:01] see
[1:01:03] it's god
[1:01:04] on this proving ground
[1:01:08] that's all earth is is the proving
[1:01:11] grounds
[1:01:12] and where he is trying to prove you
[1:01:15] so what do we think about it
[1:01:18] but do we believe that
[1:01:21] as much as we believe john 3 16.
[1:01:27] right
[1:01:31] i'm about to see a rest
[1:01:34] you see that's the way i believe this
[1:01:35] message
[1:01:40] if i can't get
[1:01:42] if i can't believe this message
[1:01:44] and it come out to produce what the
[1:01:46] the word says then i don't believe john
[1:01:49] 3 16.
[1:01:51] well now brother dale i believe jonathan
[1:01:53] it was wrote by god himself
[1:01:58] okay
[1:02:01] look what he says
[1:02:02] look at number eight
[1:02:04] possessing the enemy's gates
[1:02:12] you know he's going through church got
[1:02:14] all shook up so easy for a congregation
[1:02:16] of people to do when something
[1:02:19] just don't seem to happen the way it's
[1:02:21] supposed to be
[1:02:24] god makes it
[1:02:26] that way
[1:02:31] i've been pastor 40 40 years right at it
[1:02:37] and i have to admit sometimes that's
[1:02:38] hard to believe
[1:02:44] i've blamed the devil for doing a lot of
[1:02:47] it
[1:02:50] you know
[1:02:53] come find out god's one's doing it
[1:02:56] well
[1:02:57] i hope he forgives me
[1:02:59] i can't even just be honest see that's
[1:03:02] what peop preachers don't want to be
[1:03:03] honest tell it straight like it is you
[1:03:05] know
[1:03:07] look he said god brings tension into the
[1:03:10] church
[1:03:16] when problems start going wrong how many
[1:03:18] times i've ever told you this when
[1:03:20] things start going wrong i start looking
[1:03:23] searching for god
[1:03:25] because i know
[1:03:26] something's fixing to happen
[1:03:29] i learned that a long time ago
[1:03:33] see i don't believe that god's gone on
[1:03:35] vacation
[1:03:38] you know
[1:03:39] now i know i used to listen to the
[1:03:41] people preaching adoption back
[1:03:43] especially when we first came into the
[1:03:44] message
[1:03:45] in the uh
[1:03:47] early 70s late 60s
[1:03:50] and they wanted to preach adoption they
[1:03:51] were going through a lot of churches
[1:03:53] were
[1:03:54] but i listened to those people and i
[1:03:56] thought
[1:03:57] that's not exactly the way i see it
[1:04:00] maybe their word was right and you know
[1:04:03] but the way i saw most people was that
[1:04:05] adoption
[1:04:07] they think adoption is god coming on the
[1:04:09] scene in me
[1:04:17] the sun sees coming forth
[1:04:21] well i did never believe it that way
[1:04:24] i'm sorry
[1:04:26] because you know what i believe about
[1:04:28] adoption i've always told you
[1:04:30] it's god coming on the scene
[1:04:32] right i thought we believed the tudor
[1:04:36] the child trainer
[1:04:38] was trying to teach us the nature
[1:04:41] of the father
[1:04:44] i thought it was acting like the father
[1:04:48] not the father acting like the son
[1:04:53] see that's the way i've always believed
[1:04:54] it
[1:04:55] and people will say more blessed god
[1:04:57] when he takes out i'll be glad and i can
[1:04:58] just speak that word i said you got to
[1:05:00] get it first
[1:05:05] sensible to me you
[1:05:06] know god brings tension into the church
[1:05:10] wherever son that cometh of god must be
[1:05:12] tried and proven and tested
[1:05:16] he let sickness strike you
[1:05:20] he lets diseases
[1:05:24] come on you
[1:05:26] to test you and to prove you
[1:05:30] why
[1:05:30] to show the world that you're truly the
[1:05:34] seed of abraham
[1:05:36] now how do you want to prove your seed
[1:05:38] of abraham well bless god i'm going to
[1:05:39] raise the dead he'll see
[1:05:42] according to my understanding in the
[1:05:44] bible
[1:05:47] that it works talks about doing the
[1:05:49] works of god
[1:05:52] almost everybody explains that it's
[1:05:53] raising the dead healing and sick cat's
[1:05:55] not devils
[1:05:56] that's okay
[1:05:58] but that's not what the bible says
[1:06:01] the bible said to do the works of god is
[1:06:04] to believe
[1:06:05] them that god
[1:06:07] sins
[1:06:14] now then we put the signs and the
[1:06:16] wonders and things in a secondary form
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:21] we believe in them
[1:06:24] but we put it in another form we don't
[1:06:26] put it in number one number one is to
[1:06:28] believe the word
[1:06:34] okay
[1:06:37] show to the world that you're truly the
[1:06:39] seed of abraham
[1:06:40] he permits it by his own will
[1:06:43] he permits
[1:06:44] disaster
[1:06:46] he permits the friends to turn against
[1:06:48] you
[1:06:50] he permits all these things
[1:06:52] and turns the devil loose
[1:06:54] to tempt you
[1:06:57] remember he can't tempt you unless he
[1:06:59] turns you loose
[1:07:01] he couldn't do that with joel he took it
[1:07:02] off of him
[1:07:05] and he'll do all but take your life
[1:07:08] he could throw you on a bed of
[1:07:09] affliction
[1:07:10] he could turn your neighbors against you
[1:07:13] you can turn the church against you
[1:07:19] huh
[1:07:21] i didn't hear no amen now that i heard a
[1:07:23] few moans
[1:07:30] he can do most anything
[1:07:32] and it's god's will
[1:07:34] for him to do it
[1:07:37] amen you mean it's god's will
[1:07:40] for satan
[1:07:41] to come in a church
[1:07:43] and try to bust it up
[1:07:47] yeah
[1:07:49] now what'd brother brown will say about
[1:07:50] it
[1:07:51] he said somebody come in the church the
[1:07:52] problem start what did he say do bless
[1:07:54] god we'll get the deacon we'll throw him
[1:07:55] out the door
[1:07:58] we'll tell him he's doing that stuff
[1:07:59] around here now what'd he say
[1:08:04] pray for the person
[1:08:07] he said then the person will come in
[1:08:13] or what was the other part
[1:08:15] or he'll get out thank you
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:20] so if you want to get rid of somebody
[1:08:22] pray for them
[1:08:32] start praying for them
[1:08:34] they're going to get in or get out
[1:08:36] or what do we believe that is john 3 16.
[1:08:41] come on
[1:08:43] go look what they are
[1:08:45] it's god's will for him to do it
[1:08:48] let satan do all these things
[1:08:51] we're taught that it is more precious
[1:08:54] than gold to us
[1:09:00] i admit
[1:09:01] i've done a lot of praying here
[1:09:05] i admit i've done a lot of other things
[1:09:08] we were lying the other day when they
[1:09:10] were cleaning the church
[1:09:11] sister anna was looking up under the
[1:09:13] pews
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:17] she was thinking one thing i think in
[1:09:18] another
[1:09:21] because she said
[1:09:23] i didn't find any up under here
[1:09:27] i said but
[1:09:28] you might want to keep searching you
[1:09:30] might find them
[1:09:34] she was talking about chewing gum
[1:09:35] somebody stuck under the seat
[1:09:37] i was talking about prayer claws
[1:09:40] that i put in a lot of these seats
[1:09:48] you're going to get them and search
[1:09:49] yours
[1:09:53] you might be sitting on a prayer cloth
[1:09:55] you know what sister hannah said
[1:09:56] i give you permission to put one under
[1:09:58] mine
[1:10:02] how many would you say that
[1:10:04] and i mean seriously mean it
[1:10:08] that for me to manifest who i am to
[1:10:11] either get in or get out
[1:10:13] you know it's dangerous to hang around
[1:10:15] the bride
[1:10:21] that's the people the devil's really
[1:10:22] after
[1:10:25] okay
[1:10:27] let's go on to the next
[1:10:33] this is taken from the power of god
[1:10:36] 55.
[1:10:38] and here was moses mother in the
[1:10:40] conflict of testing of her faith
[1:10:44] you remember how old that went this
[1:10:45] whole story you know she had to put him
[1:10:46] in the arks had to push him out said
[1:10:49] okay
[1:10:51] and every child every son that cometh to
[1:10:53] god must first be tried god test your
[1:10:55] faith and look like god now look like
[1:10:58] god could just simply bypass the whole
[1:11:01] thing
[1:11:02] and don't have any
[1:11:04] appropriate way
[1:11:06] and just cut the thing off
[1:11:13] but it's better that he gives you a test
[1:11:15] and then comes to you
[1:11:19] when you're in the test
[1:11:25] the lord take this away from me
[1:11:29] no let's don't be stupid brother ryan
[1:11:30] wasn't stupid he wasn't meaning that you
[1:11:33] don't pray for the lord to take away
[1:11:35] things because we're supposed to pray
[1:11:36] for the lord to take away thanks we're
[1:11:38] supposed to pray for him to help us when
[1:11:39] we're hurting and give us some help and
[1:11:41] to do these things
[1:11:43] what's he meaning
[1:11:48] we don't pray for god to take away the
[1:11:50] test
[1:11:51] we pray for him to help us that we may
[1:11:54] be able to pass it
[1:11:55] right
[1:12:00] but it's better that he gives you a test
[1:12:02] and then comes to you when you're in the
[1:12:03] test
[1:12:04] i like that don't you
[1:12:09] how many can seriously say you like that
[1:12:14] and you just got to a horrible situation
[1:12:19] right
[1:12:22] my brother danny laying up there in that
[1:12:24] hospital
[1:12:25] he said order note he was out of his
[1:12:27] mind
[1:12:28] but for two weeks
[1:12:31] they was coming in and out and talking
[1:12:32] to him and he was talking to us for two
[1:12:34] weeks and just lifeing and we was
[1:12:35] talking about hunting and we're doing
[1:12:37] everything in intensive care
[1:12:41] and they come in and they said
[1:12:43] well we need to work on your spleen he
[1:12:45] said we'll get on with it
[1:12:46] he said order note he wouldn't awake
[1:12:50] you need to do this about get on with it
[1:12:54] you know what one day he woke up he
[1:12:55] didn't want him to do nothing
[1:13:02] but my point is what
[1:13:04] was god away from him
[1:13:12] you know
[1:13:13] i'm serious gonna try to be you know
[1:13:16] then we totally go in opposition don't
[1:13:19] we
[1:13:22] it looks like the best thing to do to
[1:13:25] get god to come to you
[1:13:26] is to
[1:13:28] get in trouble
[1:13:31] now we know that's not true and i'm just
[1:13:33] explaining something
[1:13:35] but it does seemingly
[1:13:37] but no we shouldn't do that we just
[1:13:39] should realize one thing
[1:13:42] do you realize
[1:13:44] job's name was in heaven
[1:13:48] do you realize job was a conversation
[1:13:51] piece in heaven
[1:13:53] between god and the devil right
[1:14:00] don't you ever think about maybe your
[1:14:02] name might be mentioned up there
[1:14:06] danny don't you think it's all the
[1:14:08] trouble you had maybe your name was
[1:14:09] brought up somewhere
[1:14:12] how about it
[1:14:16] at least
[1:14:18] he said satan go get him
[1:14:20] you know
[1:14:24] okay
[1:14:27] look
[1:14:29] he said i like that don't you
[1:14:31] the greatest experiences
[1:14:33] of my life
[1:14:36] is when i come up against a mountain
[1:14:39] that i can't get over it under it or
[1:14:42] around it
[1:14:46] and just stand still
[1:14:48] and god will move the thing back
[1:14:52] he will move no matter how dark the
[1:14:54] cloud is
[1:14:55] faith pierces it yonder with an eye that
[1:14:58] looks beyond everything
[1:15:00] that the devil can sit before you
[1:15:03] because god is our victory
[1:15:06] do we believe that
[1:15:11] look at the next one
[1:15:16] this is jehovah gyra 57.
[1:15:20] you're asking me to kill and destroy the
[1:15:22] only evidence that i have who's just
[1:15:24] talking about abraham the promise to
[1:15:27] kill isaac right
[1:15:30] you'll keep your word and make me a
[1:15:31] father of nations
[1:15:34] what
[1:15:35] you're asking me to kill and destroy the
[1:15:37] only evidence that i have that you'll
[1:15:39] keep your word and make me a father of
[1:15:41] nations
[1:15:45] god
[1:15:46] how god loves to test his people
[1:15:48] every child that comes to god must be
[1:15:50] tested child trained no exceptions
[1:15:53] everyone
[1:15:54] and maybe tonight
[1:15:56] that you're sick
[1:15:59] just to have a little child training
[1:16:01] just a little testing
[1:16:03] don't be discouraged
[1:16:05] god's on the throne
[1:16:08] he knows all things
[1:16:12] if we're truly born of the spirit of god
[1:16:16] everything's working together
[1:16:19] for your good.
[1:16:22] and we'll get to it a little bit
[1:16:24] wednesday
[1:16:26] where it's talking about that
[1:16:28] all things work together for the good
[1:16:31] and that are they called
[1:16:35] now i'll have a lot of trouble trying to
[1:16:37] explain it but
[1:16:39] you know that a sinner can't have a
[1:16:40] sixth sense
[1:16:43] you can have faith for the time to be
[1:16:44] healed of a disease or sickness or
[1:16:46] whatever
[1:16:47] but he can't have a sixth sense
[1:16:50] i don't care what you think
[1:16:53] you're going to wait till wednesday
[1:16:55] or a couple of weeks and we'll read what
[1:16:57] brother branham says
[1:17:00] but i've seen them people heal that's
[1:17:01] faith for the time
[1:17:04] because you can only have a sixth sense
[1:17:06] if you're born again
[1:17:12] no sinners have got no no no
[1:17:18] we're going to believe what he says or
[1:17:20] forget it right
[1:17:24] he's going to make everything right he
[1:17:26] promised he would he swore he would
[1:17:29] and he's got to keep that word
[1:17:31] he's kept it now for oh thousands of
[1:17:34] years to ever believe her
[1:17:37] would you be any exception no sir
[1:17:40] we're no exception
[1:17:41] then watch him
[1:17:43] no exception
[1:17:45] well let me get a couple more
[1:17:49] look what he says here on
[1:17:52] the message be certain of god
[1:17:58] you know god loves to test you
[1:18:01] he loves to see the reaction of your
[1:18:02] faith
[1:18:04] did you know that
[1:18:06] god loves to see how you react
[1:18:09] when you say oh lord i believe you the
[1:18:12] heart my savior
[1:18:14] i believe that you're the healer i
[1:18:16] believe you're the one who gives the
[1:18:17] holy holy spirit the things that i'm
[1:18:20] requiring
[1:18:21] you are god who gives that
[1:18:24] make an only great confession
[1:18:26] then when you confess all your sins and
[1:18:28] promise god
[1:18:30] that you will do if he'll let you get
[1:18:32] well
[1:18:34] then because it don't happen
[1:18:37] you run off like a coward
[1:18:41] well no
[1:18:42] some mercy
[1:18:44] he said god can't use that
[1:18:49] there's no way for him to use you
[1:18:52] if that's the way you are there's no way
[1:18:55] for him to answer you
[1:18:57] because he only answers
[1:18:59] by faith
[1:19:02] and all of a sudden you go away and you
[1:19:04] can't answer
[1:19:07] this real true faith stands there
[1:19:09] being sure that god is
[1:19:12] be certain that he is
[1:19:14] and if god asks this thing to be done
[1:19:17] to confess your sins and so forth and
[1:19:19] you've done it
[1:19:20] faces that he is
[1:19:24] it's certain that it's going to happen
[1:19:28] your request has to be granted
[1:19:31] oh i hope you don't miss that
[1:19:34] i'm s i'm
[1:19:35] if you're sure of god
[1:19:37] god's sure of his word
[1:19:39] is only waiting
[1:19:41] to test you
[1:19:45] like i say that people think boy we're
[1:19:47] going out of here god so loves that
[1:19:49] bride he's not going to let her go
[1:19:50] through persecution
[1:19:57] if i was you i'd read a lot
[1:20:00] and pray a lot
[1:20:06] because
[1:20:09] there's too many things a prophet says
[1:20:11] about it
[1:20:12] and i'm not going to argue with nobody
[1:20:14] about it
[1:20:16] brother dale are you a doomsday god
[1:20:18] looking for bad things happen you don't
[1:20:20] have to
[1:20:22] i preached a message 40 years ago
[1:20:26] um maybe 30.
[1:20:28] give or take 10 years
[1:20:31] i preached the messages entitled it
[1:20:33] persecution
[1:20:34] why we must have it
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:39] you know why we must have persecution we
[1:20:41] won't line up
[1:20:44] so
[1:20:44] it gives us a test
[1:20:46] he puts us through
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:52] come on
[1:20:57] if he asks that thing to be done just
[1:21:01] confess your sins and walk into it
[1:21:05] see where it's done or not look at this
[1:21:06] next one be certain of god
[1:21:09] 1959
[1:21:13] and the woman that she's seen those that
[1:21:15] crucial hour coming no doubt she checked
[1:21:18] up and said lord
[1:21:19] i've done all that i know how to do
[1:21:22] when you've done everything you know how
[1:21:23] to do
[1:21:24] and whatever requirement that god has
[1:21:26] required that's where faith takes a hold
[1:21:30] right you're sick
[1:21:33] now what did we read the other day
[1:21:35] brother brown says you're sick
[1:21:38] what'd he say
[1:21:40] he said first we got some home remedies
[1:21:43] you remember that one
[1:21:47] you know on the internet don't know
[1:21:49] about that just run in home remedies and
[1:21:51] you'll find it
[1:21:52] he said first we got some home remedies
[1:21:54] we try
[1:21:56] he said and then we
[1:21:58] that don't work
[1:21:59] he said we go to the doctor
[1:22:03] and he said if that don't turn out we go
[1:22:04] to god
[1:22:05] well that's being sensible right
[1:22:08] that's good steps
[1:22:12] i can't stand people that stomp their
[1:22:14] toe
[1:22:15] and they want the ambulance to come and
[1:22:17] pick them up
[1:22:19] now you've seen that at you
[1:22:23] i've seen kids
[1:22:25] stump their toe and screaming hollering
[1:22:27] mom and dad i wanted to get a stick and
[1:22:30] give them some other reasons
[1:22:33] somewhere else to get a mind off of that
[1:22:35] toe
[1:22:38] right
[1:22:40] but then you see other kids
[1:22:43] kick off the whole end of his toe he
[1:22:45] said man you need
[1:22:47] it'll be all ready to go back
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:52] come on you raised kids
[1:22:56] you know john martin them out there one
[1:22:57] time one boy hit the other mouth with a
[1:23:00] baseball bat
[1:23:02] cut clean through his lip teeth cut
[1:23:05] clean through
[1:23:06] he went in the house and he said
[1:23:08] hey look i mean he's bleeding he said
[1:23:11] put a piece of ice on his mouth
[1:23:15] a couple of days later the kid was
[1:23:16] running all right
[1:23:23] but if you've met a requirement
[1:23:26] then just stand there
[1:23:29] because you see
[1:23:31] that's where faith takes a whole
[1:23:35] faith takes a whole going to the next
[1:23:37] one i'm going to read a couple
[1:23:40] this is the god of this evil age
[1:23:43] and look what the prophet says
[1:23:46] paragraph
[1:23:47] 39
[1:23:49] we find that this evil ages to prove
[1:23:52] what
[1:23:52] to satan
[1:23:55] she is not like eve
[1:23:57] that she is not that type of a woman
[1:24:01] she will be tried by his word
[1:24:05] no
[1:24:06] it doesn't stay there she'll be tried by
[1:24:08] the world and the things of life
[1:24:11] he says she'll be tried by his word
[1:24:15] and if it ain't a trial now
[1:24:17] i don't know where your
[1:24:19] human brain is at
[1:24:24] right
[1:24:26] two souls two lord seven thunder verse
[1:24:28] proves you
[1:24:29] no holy ghost
[1:24:36] i told you
[1:24:39] 40 years ago
[1:24:41] did you thank the two-soul doctrine at
[1:24:43] about the time of it
[1:24:44] so you think the two-soul doctrine is
[1:24:46] deceiving
[1:24:47] i said they'll come a day
[1:24:49] it'll be worse
[1:24:51] but joe's got a tape if you want to
[1:24:53] listen to it where the man is talking
[1:24:55] about how wrong brother branham is
[1:24:59] but it's so smooth
[1:25:01] until it's very very deceiving
[1:25:09] but you know right in the middle of it
[1:25:11] you know what he does
[1:25:13] he does when i ask you
[1:25:16] i said somebody falls against this
[1:25:18] message
[1:25:20] you know somebody turns against the
[1:25:22] message
[1:25:25] the first thing they do the women start
[1:25:27] cutting their hair and wearing
[1:25:28] pants painting the face why
[1:25:31] why
[1:25:32] when that's the bible to tell you not to
[1:25:34] do it
[1:25:36] you could at least be decent
[1:25:40] you know what the men started talking
[1:25:41] about
[1:25:42] well
[1:25:44] it's all right for women to cut their
[1:25:46] hair
[1:25:46] not cut it now just trim the edges to
[1:25:49] make it grow straight and
[1:25:52] and you know what he quotes brother
[1:25:53] branham
[1:25:55] now what would you do if you didn't know
[1:25:57] what brother brown said
[1:25:59] you know what he quotes and this is
[1:26:01] almost a verbatim
[1:26:04] he said brother reynolds said said that
[1:26:05] woman
[1:26:06] been cutting bangs for 25 years
[1:26:09] said she just go ahead and cut them
[1:26:13] i want the quote
[1:26:17] i've got the original what he said
[1:26:22] but you see what i'm talking about
[1:26:24] when you turn against this message
[1:26:26] you're just not going to turn against
[1:26:27] brother ryan
[1:26:29] you're going to turn against the bible
[1:26:31] and ever born again believer
[1:26:33] down through time that it stood the test
[1:26:37] right
[1:26:40] he said there's a man down here
[1:26:42] and he gave like two initials for his
[1:26:44] name
[1:26:45] said
[1:26:46] he's got more signs and wonders than
[1:26:48] brother branham had said he eclipsed
[1:26:50] brother branham and signs and wondered
[1:26:52] about three times he said
[1:26:54] you know what happened somebody said
[1:26:56] something
[1:26:57] he pulled it off
[1:27:01] right that's brother joe but we got the
[1:27:04] reason where he said it
[1:27:08] he said you say run around and said this
[1:27:10] was the life sign he said this ain't the
[1:27:12] life sign you remember that run around
[1:27:14] this is the life sign whatever he said
[1:27:16] this ain't the life sign he said that
[1:27:17] guy's got more signs than brother
[1:27:19] branham
[1:27:20] ever had
[1:27:25] you see what you're gonna do
[1:27:27] all right
[1:27:31] she will be tried by the word
[1:27:35] the bride as adam's bride was tried by
[1:27:37] the word
[1:27:38] and adam's bride believed every bit of
[1:27:41] the word
[1:27:42] all but confused on one promise
[1:27:45] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:27:47] forever
[1:27:48] that's all she was confused on
[1:27:52] hebrews 13 8.
[1:27:55] see but failed on one promise under the
[1:27:57] temptation of the enemy face to face now
[1:28:00] the people that's called by his name
[1:28:02] of course is his bride
[1:28:04] she is to come in contact again
[1:28:07] by the same thing
[1:28:12] not by just denominational truth
[1:28:14] or something
[1:28:16] but every word
[1:28:20] for in the beginning was of the bible
[1:28:22] man was given the word of god to live by
[1:28:24] one word misinterpreted by a man called
[1:28:26] satan
[1:28:28] in the person of an animal called the
[1:28:30] serpent right
[1:28:31] satan in this person could talk to eve
[1:28:34] and miss and interpreted the word to her
[1:28:37] and was lost see it must be every word
[1:28:42] one more
[1:28:45] possessing the case of an enemy
[1:28:49] paragraph nine
[1:28:53] god had been tested in the patriarch
[1:28:56] because he'd give him a promise
[1:28:59] and when god makes a promise
[1:29:03] he wants to be sure that this person
[1:29:06] is worthy
[1:29:08] of the promise before he fulfills what
[1:29:11] he said
[1:29:12] or what he promises
[1:29:14] if i was you
[1:29:16] i'd write that down
[1:29:19] and read it over and over
[1:29:22] so abraham had been promised that
[1:29:24] through his seed
[1:29:25] the whole world would be blessed
[1:29:28] and he'd have a son
[1:29:29] and this son out of him should come
[1:29:31] forth a seed
[1:29:33] that would bless the whole earth
[1:29:36] and then what was abraham joe
[1:29:39] take him out and kill him you remember a
[1:29:41] minute ago
[1:29:42] you mean destroy every hope
[1:29:46] to fulfill the promise
[1:29:51] and god time after time
[1:29:54] and god time
[1:29:56] after time tested him
[1:29:59] but he come to the final test
[1:30:02] before the blessing was going to happen
[1:30:07] that final test to see how you'll react
[1:30:12] he will take his promise of healing
[1:30:14] would stand just as true as we did
[1:30:17] when we stood here and accepted it no
[1:30:20] matter what the doctrine says
[1:30:24] stand just as true
[1:30:29] it's easy to go into a doctor
[1:30:33] and he says you're well and you come out
[1:30:34] and say you're well
[1:30:37] well what about when you go in and he
[1:30:39] says you're dying
[1:30:45] well i'm dying
[1:30:47] won't go die
[1:30:50] right i mean
[1:30:52] that's not being sarcastic that means
[1:30:54] true
[1:30:57] but you go into the doctor's office and
[1:30:59] he's got a medicine he says
[1:31:01] this medicine i'm going to give you
[1:31:02] today
[1:31:04] is proved to be 10 effective
[1:31:08] and 90 of the people's died with it
[1:31:10] you don't feel too good do you
[1:31:16] but you go in there and he says
[1:31:20] this medicine has been proven
[1:31:22] that we've got a 80
[1:31:25] rate
[1:31:27] of being
[1:31:28] cured compared to a 20 percent
[1:31:33] you know death rate
[1:31:35] you're feeling pretty good
[1:31:38] right
[1:31:41] why not go to the word of god it gives
[1:31:42] you a hundred percent
[1:31:44] matter of fact gives you 120.
[1:31:50] god says you're healed
[1:31:52] what are we arguing
[1:31:56] in dumb and stupid human beings i don't
[1:32:00] want to say that i'm healed because i
[1:32:02] would be lying because i'm not healed
[1:32:05] we'll just go right ahead little pity
[1:32:08] party
[1:32:09] you're out of the word to start with the
[1:32:11] word says you're healed
[1:32:14] you're a liar to start with the word
[1:32:16] says you're healed
[1:32:19] why can't we believe it
[1:32:23] simple little counts
[1:32:26] faith and
[1:32:29] the right mental attitude
[1:32:32] remember we're still on that positive
[1:32:34] attitude
[1:32:36] i ain't nowhere close to what i want to
[1:32:38] preach
[1:32:39] i'm just laying the background
[1:32:42] well you know everybody in the bible
[1:32:43] that ever amounted to anything had a
[1:32:44] positive attitude
[1:32:46] can you see job i think maybe oh well
[1:32:50] okay
[1:32:53] a man without the holy ghost said i know
[1:33:01] there was nothing could take that away
[1:33:02] from him
[1:33:06] took his family
[1:33:09] took all of his goods
[1:33:11] he still had the same confession
[1:33:13] there's none of you and i've been
[1:33:14] through anything yet compared to
[1:33:17] anything of those in the bible that we
[1:33:19] can read
[1:33:20] off right
[1:33:24] but yeah we're so down and out
[1:33:30] when are we going to start saying what
[1:33:32] god says
[1:33:37] when are we going to start confessing
[1:33:40] and believing it
[1:33:43] brown said most of our faith is mental
[1:33:45] faith
[1:33:46] he said we'll get to it wednesday he
[1:33:48] said that most people misinterpret
[1:33:51] hope for faith
[1:33:58] that's why i've always said to you you
[1:34:00] see people that come up and tell them i
[1:34:02] got cancer immediately i'm healed i'm
[1:34:04] healed i believe god's word i'm healed
[1:34:06] i'm healed
[1:34:09] you let sight and time take over
[1:34:12] and they start dwindling away
[1:34:16] well maybe i'm not healed
[1:34:19] see you done lost it
[1:34:24] it's easy to believe when instant
[1:34:26] healing comes
[1:34:28] but you know what
[1:34:29] there's no testing of your faith with an
[1:34:31] instant healing
[1:34:33] the testing of your faith is when you
[1:34:35] have to hold on
[1:34:42] a little personal
[1:34:45] i've had to walk in this message a lot
[1:34:46] of times
[1:34:50] by myself
[1:34:52] in the basis that i was the one that
[1:34:54] believed it that way
[1:34:58] and i stood with it
[1:35:01] and i still believe it that way
[1:35:08] you may have to walk by yourself
[1:35:13] but remember
[1:35:15] what did we say test comes means god
[1:35:18] comes
[1:35:22] he's not going on vacation
[1:35:24] adoption is bringing the father on the
[1:35:27] scene not the sun on the same
[1:35:31] brings the father's nature and being
[1:35:33] into you to be displayed
[1:35:40] we're still stumbling where jesus said
[1:35:44] i go to my father
[1:35:46] and your father
[1:35:48] i go to my god
[1:35:50] and your god
[1:35:53] well it must have been two of them
[1:35:55] because jesus was going to his god
[1:36:04] sight and time
[1:36:05] the worst enemies of god
[1:36:09] we were there in 68 67
[1:36:13] and even though the prophet had passed
[1:36:15] home it was still
[1:36:17] running a little upgrade
[1:36:21] and we'd go about talking and
[1:36:23] the upgrade then was
[1:36:25] who's to take over
[1:36:28] brother branham's call
[1:36:29] who's supposed to be the prophet who's
[1:36:31] elijah who's this and who's that
[1:36:36] you know he said he was just laying a
[1:36:38] foundation for somebody
[1:36:41] right
[1:36:42] whose folks take over
[1:36:44] is it this brother is that brother you
[1:36:46] know
[1:36:50] i remember the first time that i heard
[1:36:52] billy paul say it
[1:36:54] we was at jeffersonville indiana and he
[1:36:56] come out and he said
[1:36:57] you're wanting to know who elijah is
[1:37:01] he said i just heard today
[1:37:04] where daddy said
[1:37:06] the elijah of this day
[1:37:08] is the lord jesus christ
[1:37:15] yeah
[1:37:16] it's kind of upbeat
[1:37:20] but then it began to just
[1:37:23] dwindle away
[1:37:25] then doctrines jumped up
[1:37:30] people wanting followings pulling great
[1:37:32] groups
[1:37:36] dividing
[1:37:37] over a little split hours
[1:37:40] about the message
[1:37:44] now what is it
[1:37:48] it started another kind of upbeat
[1:37:53] but that upbeat is
[1:37:55] today more to try to get more members to
[1:37:57] the message
[1:37:58] and i believe that
[1:38:01] i believe in that
[1:38:06] but what about like i told the brother
[1:38:08] when they told them in china
[1:38:10] that you've sent us
[1:38:12] the part that shows us brother branham
[1:38:14] was a prophet i was there
[1:38:17] personally talking with the brothers
[1:38:20] that you've sent us
[1:38:24] who brother randomly is in the message
[1:38:27] says now tell us what he said what he
[1:38:30] talked
[1:38:31] i said brother
[1:38:33] don't go to the next time you're going
[1:38:35] to have one of these mystery expos
[1:38:38] that you had 200 here this year
[1:38:41] the next year are you going to have 200
[1:38:43] plus another 100 that tim's got and then
[1:38:45] you're going to sit down and you're
[1:38:47] going to tell 300 and god sent a prophet
[1:38:55] i said put somebody out to themself with
[1:38:58] the 200 that already believed brother
[1:38:59] around was a prophet
[1:39:01] and teach them what the prophet taught
[1:39:03] and immediately that word came from
[1:39:06] from china
[1:39:08] they said come now and tell us what the
[1:39:11] prophet talked
[1:39:23] but you know you and i might not be able
[1:39:24] to go to india china
[1:39:27] we can help other people go
[1:39:29] and we've tried to help here
[1:39:33] but you know we could at least believe
[1:39:35] what we read
[1:39:38] i'm serious
[1:39:41] when brother brown says something that
[1:39:43] is not correct that's human error
[1:39:46] right
[1:39:49] but when he tells me what the bible says
[1:39:52] i count them to be
[1:39:56] the word of god
[1:39:59] i don't have to line them up
[1:40:01] they're already aligned
[1:40:06] this is god in our day
[1:40:08] showing you and i to the moth of a man
[1:40:12] the word of god
[1:40:14] why can't we believe it
[1:40:18] why can't we at least believe for
[1:40:19] healing
[1:40:23] you know
[1:40:26] are we just going to die away
[1:40:29] most of us in a place right now i like
[1:40:31] what one brother said i won't call his
[1:40:33] name because i've got in trouble calling
[1:40:35] people tonight and they said later they
[1:40:36] didn't say it but this one brother is 80
[1:40:38] years old and he said somebody said
[1:40:41] you know lord's coming he said he better
[1:40:43] hurry up it don't make much difference
[1:40:45] because one way or the other i'm going
[1:40:46] to see him pretty quick
[1:40:49] he said i'm 80 years old
[1:40:54] a lot of you and i
[1:40:55] at a place
[1:40:58] that we better start believing
[1:41:02] one turn of the clock
[1:41:05] and you ain't got no money in the bank
[1:41:08] i don't care what you think you can do
[1:41:11] no we're still in america
[1:41:16] we'd probably be better off if we wasn't
[1:41:18] in america
[1:41:20] you know what
[1:41:23] think on these things
[1:41:26] when a trial comes
[1:41:27] god comes on the scene
[1:41:32] so we don't look around and cut our arm
[1:41:34] and
[1:41:36] want to go you know
[1:41:38] have faith to bring god we're not dumb
[1:41:43] we just know things are going to happen
[1:41:46] but also know that god is going to come
[1:41:51] why
[1:41:52] after the last test
[1:41:55] to abraham
[1:41:56] then the promise could be fulfilled
[1:42:00] there will be a final test to you and i
[1:42:03] to the believers of this message
[1:42:05] and what it is god will move on the
[1:42:07] scene
[1:42:08] to take us out of here
[1:42:13] you believe that i do man
[1:42:18] testing times wonderful hour come on
[1:42:21] brothers
[1:42:25] testing time
[1:42:31] more
[1:42:32] precious than gold
[1:42:37] you know what
[1:42:40] to be put to a test
[1:42:43] and god to say satan
[1:42:45] have you considered my servant
[1:42:55] he loves that
[1:42:59] talking to a
[1:43:01] bank man one day you know
[1:43:04] big man at the bank
[1:43:08] my point was god you know he was kind of
[1:43:10] in authority
[1:43:11] and he said sam he said you and your
[1:43:13] wife done something right
[1:43:16] he said you've raised a good family
[1:43:19] you know what that meant something to me
[1:43:22] for a man in his authority and his
[1:43:24] thinking
[1:43:25] to say that
[1:43:27] it meant something
[1:43:30] and i was very proud of that
[1:43:32] it make you feel good short hit
[1:43:36] i strutted a little
[1:43:39] you know
[1:43:44] but you know what
[1:43:49] if my kids
[1:43:52] were the worst kids that's ever been in
[1:43:54] the world
[1:43:56] my grandkids or their great-grandkids
[1:44:00] you know that they can't sin enough to
[1:44:01] not be my children
[1:44:09] i can't see this just turning against
[1:44:10] people because of this that or the other
[1:44:14] it wouldn't matter if my kids were the
[1:44:15] worst
[1:44:16] john dillingers and
[1:44:18] adolf hitler's or whatever you want to
[1:44:19] call them but still says my child
[1:44:26] i don't want to be associated with them
[1:44:28] but god ain't my family
[1:44:31] okay
[1:44:32] you send them to me
[1:44:37] you know i made the statement many years
[1:44:38] ago i said
[1:44:39] we've got a lot of people at lula that's
[1:44:41] got probably a lot of problems according
[1:44:43] to what everybody thinks
[1:44:47] they said if you don't want your
[1:44:48] problems just send them up lula
[1:44:50] we'll work on them a little
[1:44:54] we might make some jewels out of some
[1:44:57] you might have to run off a few
[1:45:01] and we'll make some jewels
[1:45:06] right
[1:45:09] was that not what they said
[1:45:11] about america
[1:45:14] is not the statement that was made
[1:45:17] back what 40s 30s or something said send
[1:45:20] us your people
[1:45:24] and we made a country that
[1:45:27] has been respected of all mankind
[1:45:31] out of the scum and office care of a lot
[1:45:33] of countries
[1:45:40] but it turned out to be america
[1:45:42] and i'm proud of it
[1:45:47] he said what are you talking about i
[1:45:49] said well this is father's day
[1:45:55] i didn't
[1:45:57] didn't get to know my
[1:46:01] natural father that much
[1:46:05] but i sure got one i'd love to talk to
[1:46:07] you about
[1:46:12] you know my father ain't always a dodea
[1:46:14] granddaddy
[1:46:17] oh i was going through a test one time
[1:46:19] and i was crying and i was just oh
[1:46:23] i just finally got in the car i don't
[1:46:24] know where in the world i was going i
[1:46:26] started out of the driveway and weighed
[1:46:28] her terrence i think it was terrence
[1:46:30] was coming in he said where are you
[1:46:31] going
[1:46:32] i don't know tell mom i'll be back in a
[1:46:34] little while
[1:46:40] and i drove down the road just crying
