========================================

the devil he gets upset sometimes um we had a good time yesterday didn't we and uh good to see a full house this morning and all of our friends and family that we haven't seen in a while and uh so we're just going to continue from uh in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and just take a little topic that sin should make us mourn it should uh you know when we start just kind of getting complacent and see things uh uh you know know this is before we pray this is kind of a difficult thing to talk about what to to read through what Paul's saying here in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 because it it makes people nervous when you start going through these things but what we're just going to do is we're going to it's like stacking sticks for a campfire we're just we're just laying sticks out this morning and uh and let the chips fall where they may and study this out and uh we we'll just uh tackle it from that perspective let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful Lord that we can come to you not through the blood of the of bus and goats this morning but through the blood of the Lamb of God and we come Lord Jesus Lord expecting Lord that you will teach us and instruct us and guide us through these scriptures that we're reading this morning by the holy ghost that you've given unto us Lord Jesus that we can Lord look through the eyes of that Holy Ghost teacher Lord God and give us the true meaning and the true essence of what we're studying out Lord Jesus and make these things real to us Lord we ask Lord your blessing upon the service today Lord God that you'll be with brother Burley as he's preparing Lord Jesus be with us all of us Lord that our hearts will be receptive Lord Jesus to receive what you have for us today Lord and give us exactly what we have need of Lord we pray God that you'll just bless us now in your name amen so uh and and uh we'll just kind of backtrack a little bit and and I don't have any slides I'm just going to just kind of talk through some of these scriptures but he said uh in verse one of chapter 5 it's reported commonly that there is fornication among you and uh and and I I I love that to kind of tie the uh if you tie the run this through from 1 Corinthians over to Second Corinthians in 1 Corinthians he's really uh getting the whip out in second Corinthians and if you want to read where uh he's Recon this person is reconciled and the church is reconciling everything boy Paul's pouring on the praise he's like now you youve hel handled everything with Zeal you were so zealous zealous to to get everything straightened up and and and so and and that's how the right reaction when there's something wrong in our lives or something wrong in in a church body or anything like that if we if we look at it like the way that the Corinthians were looking at it first with just apathy and complacency oh well then that's the problem that Paul's trying to address but if we'll look at it like they did in 2 Corinthians with Zeal ready to get things straightened up ready to come with desperation then that's when God can come in our midst and really move so he said it's reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and of course their reaction wasn't that great he said you are puffed up and have not rather mourn that he hath done this thing might be taken away from you so there's where I'm getting the topic from that sin should make us mourn it should not our reaction should not be to get all puffed up and and and and and respond in that negative way but to to to be afflicted because that something's wrong in our midst and you know uh our body is is a temple and and we're all part of a collective body of Believers if you know if there's anything wrong in your body in the natural like cancer or something that Springs up it begins to affect the whole body if sickness affects your and one little cell one little wrong cell can start to affect your whole body and bring you down in weakness and and bring you to a place where you can't even get out of the bed well take apply that to this to to the church what Paul's saying here is that it's not good for for you to just Overlook things in the body of Believers because one one little thing wrong in the body of Believers can cause well you know you've got unbelievers coming in and they look and they see somebody that's proc proclaiming to proclaiming to be a Christian but they're not live they're living in a blatant violation of what we know to be the gospel teaching and they'll start to say well where's your testimony what what are what's what's going on with your life and it begins to it it can damage the whole church because of just leaving something undone so Sin Sin left unchecked can can anybody just like in your natural body just a little a little illness you know the the flu is going around you know you get a little just one little think I've seen those little things where they they'll they'll show how much flu can can just you and bring you down right well the same thing in the body of Christ is is the point that we're trying to make now you keep reading down through through uh 1 Corinthians 5 and Paul starts making the point he Compares it to the Feast of unleavened bread which we'll get to in a second that he's saying Purge out therefore the old leaven in other words it's time to get cleaned up and now if you go study out in in the Old Testament where they they had the Feast of Passover where they went behind the the shed blood and they ate the the lamb and then the very next day they entered into the Feast of unleavened bread which is is time to get out and that that seven days where they were journeying from from under that under that blood and and God made a way for them to get out of Egypt 7even days of of of of traversing Into the Wilderness they did it so fast that they didn't have time for the for the bread to rise and all those kind of things so it's it's typing getting rid of the old life leaving leaving that old life and so what's what's Paul really expressing here in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 is that when you're born again things are going to begin to change in your life and you're going to get rid of that that old leaven is going to be left away that the the old Covenant the old life all of that is going to be done away with and and Christ makes us as he says a new lump a new lump now without without leav so in other words in other words the Holy Ghost cleans you up now there's so many messages where brother R talked about this concept like the Paradox we we know the Paradox you are the Paradox because a paradox is when when something miraculous happens and it's miraculous that God can take somebody that's got an old nasty horrible life and can change them can change them and make them different so that's what he saying the Corinthians got it in they're maybe got this state of apathy where they're they're not expecting change anymore they've got all the doctrine they've got maybe they they've heard the teachings of Paul or whatnot and they just get apathetic and and forget that that the sticks have got to be lit that the campfire has got to be on fire it's not good enough just to have the sticks piled up and they got all puffed up in a cloud of confusion and Chaos now that's that's what you know Satan deliberately he creates Confusion by perverting what God has made into something untrue he mixes up what is right with what is wrong and that's what causes doubt and leads individuals away from the clear unadulterated word of God and now so the Corinthians got a little bit mixed up in other words they they had become mixed up in what their focus should be they were indifferent to sin they were failing to mourn because of Pride all buffed up and self-satisfaction now now is that isn't that just a terrible place to be I I I love to study out like the character of people throughout the scripture look at the character they they they got self-satisfied with their state of Li probably you know had a lot of material wealth and things and and that was good enough for him but Paul's really bringing the whip to them that it matters when we sin right it it matters when when things off-kilter in a body of Believers it matters when something's wrong in your own spiritual life because it it and it and it also it matters what we endorse it matters what you put your hand to and say well I'm going to endorse something that's wrong or something that's not right you say like like the Corinthians say Well it it ain't that bad we'll just Overlook it ain't that bad but it was bad enough it's like if a little cancer shell in the body is bad enough to take care of that thing get get go to the doctor and get it get it taken care of go through the prayer line whatever you need to do cuz just as your temple must be kept clean the church has got to be kept clean in other words get the leaven out get get all the leaven out and you know if if you really study out what Levan is leevan is just it's just a little unseen little particle leen's in air you put out some Sour of bread and and and Le yeast can can just fall into it just from the air it's every just a little bit of that can cause the whole the whole dough to rise just a little bit will actually permeate through every little particle of of the dough and before long it's it's it's it's caused a reaction in the whole thing the same thing with sin you let a little little little small little thing begin to take place and it'll grow and grow and grow I mean you could see that same pattern through the seals just something that starts small actually will grow and grow grow until whoa it's just it's taking over right so allow an unrepented sin to persist creates us what does it do it creates a stumbling block to the individual it makes it more difficult it makes it it's it creates a stumbling block to the individual as well as to others it makes it more difficult for the church to represent the gospel now now that isn't that how the gospel Works people people out out there in the world will see your life and then they want to know more about it and then then they find out to get to the life to get to the blood you got to go through the word and then they start asking questions about the word what do you believe but what's first is the life that life that blood the life is in the blood so then you got you got things that that you're not living right it makes it more difficult for the church to represent the gospel and then it damages the church's witness cuz the life don't look right and then it affects your unity and it might encourage the same behavior in others now now that's the real the real terrible thing is when when you got young people and unbelievers and what not sitting in the church and they look and see what well they're they're doing it then I I can do it too and then it just skews the whole message of the gospel because the life is not right that's right and so what Paul's trying to express here as he frames everything up in First Corinthians five is every believer is accountable before God every you know you think about that that if something wrong is wrong in the church like that and brother I've got quotes where brother R would say if you see something in the church it's you it's your responsibility to to go to that person and say brother you ain't living right right you ain't you ain't doing right you're not you're not living what the gospel teaches CU inconsistency between CL claiming to be born being born again and continued sin sinful Behavior can lead to Serious consequences so the Corinthians were they were they were satisfied without change you know you know sometimes maybe maybe we in this present day can kind of get in that mode just maybe like the Corinthians were that it's it's fine just to kind of come to church and and just kind of be a be a part of the of the thing I I think you know it's so hard for us to get away from that Baptist idea sometimes that have have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed that just because you're part of the group that that does not mean that that's that's the end of the story it's not good enough just to like we use that campfire analogy again it's not good enough just to stack up the sticks and say well I've got all the sticks of the doctrine but it's got to actually be lit it's got to be on fire and we stack up all the mechanics we pile up all the mechanics we got our nice stack of mechanics but the Dynamics have got to be present it's got to be on fire and what is the Dynamics it's the Life of Christ actually lived in you not not coming to church and saying I'm a Christian but then there's fornication coming to church and and Paul would lay out all his list coming to church join the join the church but then you revile your wife you you Grail against your wife and Paul that was part of part of Paul's list of things that you're not going to inherit the kingdom of God if you're a reviler if you're drunken if you're if you're Covetous if you just want to he all these things to yourself and you just can't you want to have what the neighbor has and all these things because what what what's he getting to the The Life of Christ has got got to be manifest in the church the fruits have got to be present so what compromise compromise like the Corinthians we're willing to do compromise leads the church to start resembling an organization it it loses its distinctiveness but you think about that that we've got to be distinct that's that when you had started adhering to the word it makes you dress different it makes you walk different it makes you look different you don't you don't drink anymore you don't gamble anymore there's change and brother BR would say in the testimony of a true witness he said God's word is a true W witness right and God's word said in the last days there would come perilous times and men's Hearts would fail them for fear and perplexed of times and distress between the Nations and there'd come a falling away from the church and men would rise up and showing themselves big dignitaries and so forth and would power away from the church and have a form of godliness and deny the real power of God Church joining he spoke of the church getting in that condition and he he talked about how that the church would just become a lodge rather than a vibrant holy Community thus jeopardizing its mission to preach the gospel instead of striving for Holiness the church starts to adopt worldly isms and compromises that turn the church into a place defined by tradition and human standards rather than by God God's word you know you list out all those isms Calvinism Armenian ISM trinitarianism denominationalism ecumenicalism romanism nickan ISM bism and all those things are are just summing up just a cold formal religion where it's not something that you can get warned by it's not something that's alive now that's the problem with the Corinthians is that this person wasn't alive and Paul's Paul's framing it up that this that kind of thing in your life should should make you mourn if go if sin is left unchecked God's judgment is inevitable the Bible says that if you if you if you get if you start forgetting about the first works then he'll actually take your Candlestick out of his place except you repent he'll actually remove the Candlestick so the Church of the Living God is not to tolerate fornication in any of his forms not spiritual not natural hey you know what fornication really is is is when you turn away you're turning away a turning of your soul and spirit away from his word and his promises in favor of something counterfeit or some other worldly influence instead of looking to God's promise you start looking to something else and you start giving your heart to something else same thing in the natural instead of giving your heart to your wife you start giving your heart to something else and brother R said and God keeps his word he's he said they commit spiritual fornication they let their congregations paint their women wear shorts they let them go out and dress like the world and never condemn it they let the men smoke a social cigarette and take a drink of liquor they let them have their little card parties and play pool in the basement and have the proms and dances in the church and soup suppers and every other thing and teach their little petty theology instead of word of the Living God you know that's the truth it's Petty juvenile cissified I don't know what of the devil in in Christ's name I condemn it in the light of God's word and say we must be a regenerated Holy Ghost inspired Born Again walk in Walking In humility and the presence of God to ever make the Rapture in the days to come now this is Paul Paul's laying out that if you see something like this in the church and we're just study we're just walking through these scriptures then it must cause you to mourn so much until you're willing to start kind of removing that person from your fellowship you in other words you don't endorse you don't endorse somebody that's blatantly smoking that weed somebody that's blatantly living in fornication somebody that's blatantly uh you know living say Crossing that line and say what I'm I'm I'm a born again Christian I'm a Christian but their life is not manifesting it blatantly like that and you know I I I I've just been kind of thinking about how our our mind looks at things you know as we hear the word it our the word is actually shaping up it's changing our life and it's changing the way that we look at things and and that's that was the Corinthians problem they were they were unwilling to judge correctly that there was a problem in their midst and now you can you can even see that kind of thing and in just the natural just look around I I I I I I us I was I'm just going to throw this out there I was I was watching a situation unfold years ago where where there was a situation of fornication and I I watched how people would react that they would almost endorse that situation well that don't they deserve to be happy and it's like these Christians will look at a situation like that and say well that person deserves to be happy it's because their mind is not framing things up correctly and not able to judge you know I don't care how much desire you have to be happy if you look at someone that's blatantly living in sin then then it it's not according to the word it's wrong now that's what Paul was saying in verse three he said I'm not even there with you I'm absent in body but present in spirit I've already judged already and in other words I I know y'all are not doing right as though I were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such and one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus so Paul what he saying he's recognized that this believer's Behavior was so out of line with the gospel something got to happen right so out of line with the gospel so he is saying the person's got to be expelled from the church fellowship and that that safe environment of Believers where everybody's endorsing that kind of behavior and left to face the consequences of his sin you know the consequences of your sin if you were to stay in that kind of a situation where you're living in a place of fornication or something you know the Bible says that adulterers go to hell I said one of Paul's list in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 the very next chapter he said know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God right be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God so there's consequences of living in a state where you you think you're right but you're you're Li life has not been changed and it's not bearing the characteristics of Christ this this kind of this kind of talk is is kind of hard is it right you you can feel the atmosphere everybody's kind of drawing up and whatnot because it's it gets down you know you can lay out that we've got to have uh the stature of a perfect man and you got to grow come to maturity but when you get down into the weeds of what your character is that your character has got to got to actually represent the Life of Christ and you know brother Brandon would actually say in one place he said if you want to know whether whether you're born again or not if you're if you're a child of the first Adam you're going to act like the first Adam but if you're a child of the second Adam you're going to act like they did on the day of Pentecost another words when the fire got lit on the day of Pentecost it caused a change in their life and where those old things that old Covenant the old leav drops away and God transforms your life and you begin to act different and Paul PA was say he said I I wrote unto you in an epistle and in verse n he said I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators in other words he's saying don't tolerate don't tolerate unrepentant sin among those who claim to belong to God now that was the problem with the Corinthians that's a problem that's a problem still today in Le out of seir that we just we just put up we put up with the Devil the devil come at our home and and and and we'll just well we'll just put up with it we'll we we you know we'll make list like Paul we can make a list like Paul of all the things that we put up with but it still stands true that we we uh he he's trying to say don't tolerate it brother R would say God telling the Holy Holy Church which is his body here on Earth that now this is after the Old Testament and the new telling a man that was so filthy and dirty amongst the people that he lived with his own father's wife said such a thing in the body of Christ you Church turn him over to the devil for the destruction see God permits the and when he has got somebody has to see done to put a whip on somebody he'll turn an evil spirit loose on them so that they'll torment that person and bring them back in Hebrews chapter 7 he said don't never let nothing hinder this church if it does you're guilty each one of you each one of us are guilty and you and your different churches if something is going wrong in your church you're guilty because you're the overseer of that church it ain't up to the pastor it ain't up to the Deacon board it's up to you you individual could go to that brother and see if you can have him reconcile if not then take two or three with you then come back he won't hear that tell it to the church then he's dismissed from the kingdom of God God said if you dismiss him there I'll dismiss him here if you went through this order then he'll turn the devil loose to him for the destruction of his flesh and then he'll come back that's right that's the way to make him come back if he's a child of God he'll come back if he isn't why he'll go on and then the devil will send him on to his eternal place now that you you think that that's what the Church of the Living God is supposed to be that when you come to church you come with an awe and a reverence to know that there's a standard that you got to live by come with that fear of God that that there's a body of Believers that are Towing the line and we've got to tow the line too you know there's that story brother I'm told of of the little Wesley rasmusen who was a pastor son and I I'll tell the story and then we'll stop that where he said uh Wesley Matt rasmusen was was was uh it's in the message why are we not a denomination he wasn't living right he was he was living out in the world and and the Pastor said it was his the pastor's son he said I'm I'm I'm giving him till such and such a time to to make it right and and and get right with God and he was up behind the platform and looking at the clock and the clock you know struck the time and he said all he said brother randam said I just I'm we're now going to turn him over to the devil for the destruction of the Flesh in other words we ain't endorsing that anymore and and uh and brother R said that's all was said nothing went on for a week or two maybe a month or two and one night old Wesley took sick and now this this is not just a lesson for the church it's a lesson for your families as well right you pray like this for your children say Lord if you need to squeeze them through the wine press my children squeeze them a little bit put them through the ringer right God will get to move God will God God can use the devil as a tool he'll reach over in his toolbox and let a devil go to work and one night old Wesley took sick and when he got sick he kept getting sicker he called the doctor I I I'm going to step back and just say this I lot of people think that my family looks perfect on the outside but if you know me really good some of yall know me enough to know the challenges that I've faced with some of my children as they've grown up and and you know the challenges and and there's things like this that maybe you don't know all the details but but you and I I can't share all the details cuz it ain't my testimony to share but but you watch you you turn things over to God and God can God can do this is real God can begin to do something where where after it's all said and done then maybe you look at it and say well bless God brother Bob's family's perfect or whatever but you don't see all the behind the scenes you don't see all the travail and the turmoil and the late nights of prayer and the and and watching the devil actually do something that God is allowing to mold to move and you don't see all of that and and so one night old Wesley took sick and when he got sick he kept getting sicker he called the doctor the doctor come up and examined it he had a fever of 105 couldn't find no reason for it he just kept getting sicker doctor said boy I don't know what's happened to you he didn't know what to do he said we'll we'll call a specialist they called a specialist and a specialist come in there they took him over to the hospital examined him everything else he said I just can't tell you the boy just looks deathly his wife standing there crying and everything like that and the children standing around the bed and everyone like that he said he's going that's all his pulse and respiration is just going down all the time and he said call Daddy the musicians can go ahead and come oh yeah that's the way to do it call daddy and his daddy run out there to the hospital real quick to see him he said Daddy I can't now but God hears my words I'll make everything right I'll make it right yes I will and right then his respiration begin to come back normal and the following Sunday he was up before the church he said I have sinned before God in the presence of this church I refuse to hear the pastor's words I refuse to hear the Deacon here I'm asking the church to forgive me for the evil that I've done like that God has spared my life I tell you he lined up right right that's what it's got to be if you'll just do it God's way now that that seems harsh in everything as we meditate on these things that Paul said but that's how you have a real power God fill the Holy Ghost fill life and that's how you have a holy ghost filled church as you approach it with fear and trembling with Zeal like they had in second Corinthians and then you'll see something God do something God bless you [Music] right
