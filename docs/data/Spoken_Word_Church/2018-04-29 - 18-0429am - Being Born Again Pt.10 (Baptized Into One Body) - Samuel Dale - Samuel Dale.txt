these father we thank you for this day and the opportunity that we have to be able to come together to worship into Lord to talk about you and that we can father in any way that we can that we can try to help the people to see because that's what it's all about we're here for that purpose to gain not just head knowledge Lord but to gain spiritual knowledge of the kingdom and in the growth developments and we know that that must come also by head knowledge so we ask you to open our eyes of our physical beings that we could see your word but then open our hearts that we may be able to receive it by revelation forgive our sins and bless each one and just keep us all together in you in Jesus name did his brother Bob did he get the message I guess he's in the back room I know the fact okay loans we got the message he's the Minister of Industry all right first Peter we've been reading these scriptures for quite a while and been on the thought but yet the Prophet said hold it up until the people get it and then move on so that's what we're trying our best to do all right so let's go to first Peter 1:18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Hoover Li was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these life's times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory and that's your faith in your hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which abideth which liveth and abideth forever now remember whatever your birth starts with it will end in that same point or thoughts if it starts with the word the birth will end in the word it won't change and become some other idea or thought along the way it has to be to that point okay so now we go to 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter served an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according and His divine power have given them given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory in virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue and knowledge you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I know we have been we have been quite a while trying to hold on to the thought and in dealing with the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the different things trying to get that point anchored into our thinking and this past Wednesday I tried to speak just a point of of the new birth and what it is because you know we came up through in our thoughts and our studies and we found it of disciples that the church started off on the day of Pentecost with a hundred and twenty in the Upper Room receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that placing them at the basis of where it says the Holy Spirit on the pyramid you know and the Prophet said they had these virtues all right but then there was 3,000 outside that only heard one sermon so you wouldn't place them positionally but you would put those people as to the thought now get it in your mind petering them they were at a certain position because they had been two to three and a half years all right then when the Holy Ghost failed see look we're positioned all right then they could teach others and that's what Peter's doing we'll get to that later Peter is trying to teach others to try to come to where he was now whoever the others see the 3,000 outside only heard one message you know or something to that order and they become born-again Christians all right into the body of Christ sealed by the Holy Spirit giving turn a life into their soul all right making them part of the body of Christ so that's the group of people Peter is dealing with now we'll keep emphasizing this point until we get it's anchored into our mind because we read it that Peter said that he was sending this message to those of like precious faith right now see then that light precious faith is not sending to 120 because they have gone beyond that in their growth development and been sealed in and and positioned because of the word they heard but it's to those that were in Christ as we'll get to in a minute and how do you get into Christ by one spirit should all baptized into one body right all right see then that Holy Spirit it puts us into the kingdom all right now we will review these letters we come back through but yet peter dinh and Paul and them would be speaking of babies but yet that have the earnest of the inheritance sealed into the kingdom but yet the growth development it's not dark all right see is I hope you follow that because I keep emphasizing that point that that one hundred and twenty ain't saying all of them it's whatever God does with them but I'm just saying this group of people that were used like Peter and them to write the word all right now see those that were there in the upper room were used to write the word you don't see a novice over somewhere with God giving them sure he can't but he always sends it by those who are anchored in the word all right so those people in the upper room were anchored as the Holy Spirit could quicken under the and Jesus said I'll call dear if the Holy Ghost would come comforter and will call to you remember it's watch whatever he's tall and the Prophet said even teach them things to come all right then it's left up to somebody to advance to a position to be able to teach us how to get tired and be like me saying to you no I said come on down on down to brother Donnie shop tomorrow and and I'm going to show you how to tear down a transmission and put it back together now I could show you how to tear it down right Richard tore a motor apart up in the building one day and he was turned down and this throwing blokes here and there and I said I'd have to ride on every one of them were it when I said you think that thing gonna run well you know surprisingly did you know he got it back together you know why cause he'd done it before he'd been there well that's what God is doing with the disciples see that become the Apostles disciple means a follower possible means one sent they became the apostles to bring the word to the people to show us how to get to where they were all right seeing that you understand what I'm saying then that three thousand needed somebody to teach them we yet they were born again and Peter was saying I'm born again well written a minute and he said I'm bringing this to those that are born again like I am but it was to show how to grow in grace and knowledge alright so then what I've done Wednesday night is drop back and just kind of like we're starting the point of you know the new birth all right what is the new birth we know it's the birth of the word all right now so then we start from that like them back there like the three thousand that heard the word receive the new birth when we receive the new birth that's what it does to in me it makes us babies in Christ they don't make us full-grown no more than a natural baby would be born full-grown all right see if we take the natural to top the spiritual when I see then once we are born again you realize that really the new birth just puts you into position to grow and just put you in position to grow in Christ all right see it doesn't do it oh we Baptists we got everything yeah yeah we got everything that's where it in the message I got everything I just come in the message I got everything well words you get it you know I mean it's that's just the point where did you get it how did you get it when I born into it see that's where people who tell you you can't tell me I don't have it all I've got quotes from the Prophet okay I'll go with you I know where the Prophet said when you receive the Holy Ghost you get all you need I don't agree with that when you receive the Holy Ghost you get all you need that's all you need right that's all you need because that's gonna take you through that's gonna give you the new Birds it's just like a baby when it's born into this world it's got all that it needs right but it certainly doesn't have all that it's gonna get of necessity to live right see then that's what I'm trying to get us to do now is to say all right now we're trying to place our point back because I keep quoting these and I gave them a bunch to you the other day you know where the Prophet said the Holy Ghost we receive the same Holy Ghost there was even with Abraham and let him through the same Holy Ghost that came onto their Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost new birth that you receive when you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and listen member covering Wednesday and when he accepts you now we accept him as our Savior we must all right and we can't do that remember until God starts dealing with us okay but when he starts dealing with it he calls us to himself all right that call is what leads us home it's we're talking about Wednesday night go to future home and listen to what the Prophet had decided see you repent of your sins and God forgives you your sins all right when he said that does nothing to the future part of you all that does is remit the sins of the past all right now then he says we go on to sanctification cleansing and setting aside right and how is that done by the studying of God's Word I'm coming to church but I'm doing it following things that you're supposed to do getting away from things you're not supposed to do you know and seeing those stages you have something to do now listen when you repent of your sins that's something for you to do right so you have something to do with your justification your salvation starts by believing on Jesus Christ amen all right and as it does you have something to do with that now listen the thing when you come to sanctification the cleansing and set them aside for service you have something to do with that yet it is the work of the Holy Spirit it was the goodness of God the Bible said that leadeth us to repentance all right what you see it's you and him working now forgive me don't get all blue I know it ain't a sister listen what I'm saying justification is God coming to you just showing you that you need to be saved the goodness of God is calling you and you can't come unless he does all right now that's why I brought a rattling sight don't go back to my old or something like that and get to people try to talk them into coming up he said you'll make them a 2-fold child cuz they're gonna have a harder time the next time he said let God do the work yeah but I'm glad to you can't argue with people they're not gonna listen to you Lord told me to go do that I don't do what Laura told me all right I'm gonna do what the Prophet said okay I ain't going back darin gets you and bring you up here I've been there that's reason I ain't gonna do it he didn't doing good with me it drove me the other way but you see Church that's what it does justification our repentance leads us to Christ we repent of our sins realizing we're sinners all right so it's the work of God dealing with you to get you to repent but you got a part to do with it why you got to repent well I've got the other salvations in God ain't no come on listen to what I'm saying don't be so think you know you know well salvation of the Lord Amen but you got to repent it sanctification is dealing with that unclean spirit being driven out of us that ol Adamic nature coming into us as we were children and coming into the world and thing all right the salvation the sanctification starts cleansing that taking it out of us until we get new desires and you thoughts and all like that but that's the danger one cause when you start doing that see you start thinking well I'm saved what I need anything else I've had these desires to go away from me that's why I brought around them in I believe it's Chrysler mystery he said that's why you see scrap heaps of ministers and Christians he said piled along the way yeah but what do you want me to do you mean I want you to listen to the word the Holy Spirit starts working through sanctification cleansing us and bringing us to a place all right let's see your you are the one that's having to work in that room with God now listen because he's condemning you for do it and you repent and you try to get rid of these things and do these things right but then when salvation comes now that's you accepting him a justification sanctification but when salvation comes that's when he's accepting you joys all the work of the Holy Spirit but yet you the only thing you do in the new birth is accept Jesus Christ you accept him as your Savior you asked for forgiveness of your sins you follow after him through the cleansing of the daily lives and the times but then when he accepts you now salvation is of the Lord from in oh oh you gonna be doing is yielding yourself to that that's within you so it's not working up this or working of that one I was trying to get that Wednesday night cause like I said we we teach somebody said what what is the new work its justification same getting baptism although well if that's not explained if that's not explained what ideas do you have children what do you think about when you say justification more didn't I see that's why we need to explain what justification is that is you repent of your sins it's you accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior and crying out for repentance what is sanctification it's God coming in and working a work through you to drive out that unclean spirit No remember now listen real careful remember you can say justification is only the outward part of man no it's not that's what's wrong with the religious world because they do repent they do ask for forgiveness but if there's not something from that very inward soul of mankind now you're going to differ with Arabic go ahead repentance starts from the inward man not just your body in your spirit repentant that's what's called called caused the biggest portion of the world to be religious than never to be cleansed you say wait a minute you got Satan in there that's right but you're in there too right you said wait a minute no wait a minute devil ain't in me will you tell me is not then I'll tell you your own that soul of that baby that child a person whatever age whatever accountability God does not just deal with your body there's no salvation of that part he does not deal just with your spirit there's no salvation to that part it's just acquitting or doing a ritual or do it's something on the inside you say yeah but I don't understand how it can be something in there when Satan is there that's true but you were there all he's there is converting your nature making you think wrong and do wrong all right so see justification starts with the soul then sanctification drives that unclean spirit out of that soul that nature that part of you that was a damn it that's why we got to get it filled or keep it clean because if not then the unclean spirit will come back were not in your body forget all of that let it come from the inside out that's what we tried to do we tried to outwardly make Christians of people we've tried to do it in their body and you see them come to church do for a while but then you see them fall away but why is it that you see some that come they'll just keep coming they'll keep coming and after a while they get settled in and then going with the Lord but the biggest portion now you know yourself the biggest portion you get somebody to alter you get them to come and pray and they believe they're saved but they're doing they don't go on they don't have nobody to tell them how to go on and see then after a while you see them falling away without half what would it be the second time you try to get them to the altar see that's why this the Scriptures tells you the it's the goodness of God that leads you to repentance God not dealing with you brain he's got to work through that come on he's got to work through your ears would you realize right now through your ears in your brain that your two parts now you tell me on it right because the devil's on one side talking to these gods on the other side now we don't believe in them little devil sticking out over here somewhere right you know the pictures of all that we talk about junk we're talking about if you don't go on with God and know how to go on with God especially to the young ones you got to be justified safe I feel the Holy Ghost they know nothing about what you're saying and what I was trying to do Wednesday night because I wanted to start with just as simple as I could start of the new birth because that's what those 3,000 got was the new birth right but it was only from one sermon right how could they know very much about God but they believed because read the book of Acts of how that Peter laid down that scripture to us showing the things and what it was and how Christ died and all the things and then when they did they come under conviction and they said men and brethren what must we do to be saved then it was now like the Prophet said they asked what it was to do to be safe did we tell them what not to do well you need to quit this knee quit that would know that is what the Bible says the Bible said repent everyone else be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right it puts it to a basis that you got to just get you just starting mental salvation will only make new converts but after a while they'll go away but if people would just that's always only thing that I've ever tried to do is get people to just sit down and listen because everybody that comes here when they start a brother Dell Sandeep I can't understand you well that's the deep I can't understand you sit down and listen for a while you've listened to everything else you remember the story talk about Rollo and that guy wanted to tell me about this statue of perfect land he said okay I got sixty five sermons I'll sing I ain't got time to listen sixty five sermons he said you've listened to everything else and ain't come up with nothing you think I'm Stern what is it true listen salvation does not work in your body it does not work in your spirit what good is it to have a good body in a good spirit salvation is in the soul of mankind and that soul of mankind is created now brother Branham on you arguing him he said everybody's born with the same gift come on yeah come on you like to quote but you don't want to quote at all everybody's born with that pool to God every person in the world is born with some form of drawing of them toward God that's why they worship a totem pole or an animal or this or that or the other or how some kind of a thing it's because of the desire that's within their soul not just in the body and spirit that just passes go to the n-word part of man go to the soul and talk to the soul I don't like to talk to bodies I don't like to talk to spirits cuz you said turn deceive me you shaky head yes and the heart you're gonna know I don't know what's going on in you when I'm breaching but if I see a constant development in the word and a change coming into the person then I say okay it's working let's see we just like all of the rest what is it to be safe I shout that spoken time to cry come on that's outward effect outward effect then I'll quote brother Branham did he say this he said if you need healing or something he said if you stand up and start this way he said now I'm paraphrasing it so it's close he said the biggest portion of the things over because he said you made up your mind back to her you just come in down here to be prayed for he said you made up your mind back to her what was it with a man it picked up the foot track and ready where will you spend eternity something started right there from work the brain no body no spirit no from that soul what is the soul of man that's what you are that's that part that's within you and brother innocent souls in prison he said that's the part that God is working home look into the soul he's not working into your head in your body let it come from the inside out he's working on that soul that's within you and that's why David look at him David said my soul thirsteth he didn't say my body he didn't say my spirit because he knew and both of them he had problems he said my soul thirsteth after the old God you know what brother run said he needed the baptism of the holy God was right he needed something to come and change that nature part that was within him because he was a sinner by Nature we're all sinners by nature and in that soul mankind is made to certain thirst after God he does it by you know serving and doing everything he work itself to death and well do I remember that coming up through the Baptist and well I do everything just like I do here if you need something to be done I'll go do it well because that's just always been a part of my desire you don't see me standing back well we need to go do something I just get up and go do it didn't think we're saying well if you hadn't got up went do it well you didn't get up and go do it for what you said up we'll talk about somebody else all right but listen salvation is in the soul of man it's not in your body in your spirit that's an outward of fact that's why within your soul the new birth is the birth of the world when that's trying to get over Wednesday then you shout then you cry then you speak in tongues then you have the great that was an aftereffect I got the new birth code I spoke in tongues I shouted I cried I felt this feeling amen praise God but did something happen on the inside the salvation is in the soul if that soul don't cry out to God then it's not gonna have any fact that's why Jesus knew what he was talking about when he said it no man can come to the Father but by me you see the people coming to the hour you see them coming in and do it but you see them the next time they're doing the same thing again you'll write back they'll do the same things again or you know and there's word you're wrong you think I'm against emotion sometime but you see you get people to the alter by emotions you're gonna get them the next time by emotion because all you're dealing with on emotion is a body in the spirit of an individual if I don't ask raise a hand on but how many of you believe the new birth is of Earth of the word I did if it's the birth of the word the births in the soul it's not in the body and spirit so it's the word the disciples took inhaled and they had an understanding the Bible says of it that Jesus explained the parables of the kingdom etc and the thing the sowing of the sea he explained all of that and these easy was explaining it see they were getting a knowledge of what they needed and what they needed was the Holy Ghost that fell under that Pentecost to quicken that that they had heard but are you understanding then three and a half years of what they heard but the other group only got one message I say one message come on folks those people around our to heard about Jesus and is that in the other but yet one message is all they heard but they accepted Jesus Christ and he accepted them he said what did they do they went through now listen this is what I've been trying to get across to you the new birth is justification same thing a baptism will hold ago the Prophet said he always talked in three stages justifications not the new birth sanctification is not the new work the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth but you must be justified sanctified before you can be born again so then those people right there that day and so it's the house of Canisius you know cause you go right on them they heard one sermon and right there at one time they went through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost got it that one time you said well why don't it happen today look at brother Branham as an example come on Billy Graham went to all of those places and he couldn't get one convert come on the random went and showing the signs and wonders of an Almighty God the preaching of the word brought thirty thousand blanket ladies to Jesus Christ well they only got see that's you're making it now you say well they got justified are you making that that's your plans I'm saying what he said he said they accepted Jesus Christ and he said they acted the same way you acted when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on do you see what I'm trying to get across to all of us what is the new birth it's the birth of the word yeah but that what you mean I just read it no it's when that word is made alive then you'll shout then you'll cry then you'll scream out to God and glory hallelujah and have a wonderful time why because the word has been made alive to you and you got something anchored that Satan can't get away from I mean can't get it away from you but he can get it away from that body in that spirit see salvation is in the soul of mankind all right see the why the preaching of the gospel what did the prophets say he said true prophets bring true burros he said false prophets rain falls first what see instead of listening to that and understanding and just accepting it well true prophets that there's only one true prophet but it rhymes only true prophet so he's the only one that can get a birth see you tell me the devil don't get in your mind and try to run around all of those things all over in that spirit being part of you you see why it's so hard to preach the truth you see why the new birth is the hardest thing to preach but to get people to realize first off you got to be saved alright but that's got to be from an inward part of you that's why I'm coming to church and doing brings you under an atmosphere Sunday School the teachings of little bitty ones coming up they're getting under an atmosphere sister Gail asked me when we started a Sunday School class years ago said what do you want me to teach them children I said teach them children one day got to be saved but I said teach them that the God that was with David and had a sling and took down a John and a bar you know that they can take what's in their heart so love them and they can tackle that same devil what if we'd been taught that all the way down no what have we been taught come to the altar you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior you believe Jesus died for you then little kid don't even know what's going on come on you were there or do like I said see I was 18 years old my sister came to them in the church and she started telling me she said you you know that my husband he died the car wreck you know he's lost he said he didn't have an opportunity which you got an opportunity well you know what I'm standing there thinking hey he got a better opportunity then you got I thought as much of his Christianity as I thought of hers when I've heard her tell it and I believe it that she had many times prayed and felt the very lags of the Lord Jesus and held on to him she was a spiritual woman in that formed of things but I thought as much of his salvation as I did of hers well because I'll live with them right but you see church back dark I just didn't have nobody to help me to try to find the truth that's what I'm talking about what's the truth now are we getting them as the Prophet said to Christ are getting them to a doctor or an idea he said what brother Dale you're just not emotional we need to get to people emotional get them born again they'll be emotional so what are we working on getting them emotional or getting them born again all right if you believe it that the new birth is a burst of the word then the whole statue of a perfect man is being born again until the headstone comes it'll be the opening of the word there's a new birth your new birth is the opening of the word making you a child of God let's see if we make it as to be some emotional thing we got to do and come on church I believe in every bit of it when God deals with you you're going to be emotional you're going to cry you're going to shout you're going to be happy don't lose that well I just don't understand it cuz brother do you say that the new birth of birth of the word well I didn't say that the Prophet did was still well I thought it had to have some form of emotion with it may I'll quote the Prophet a stillborn baby is a dead baby paraphrasing it right you get it stillborn baby is a dead baby so we think that we've got this that no it's the birth of the word what if the church is edit out that to us what did they teach you will get them to do this get them to do that get them to go here you don't go there get them there get this time we'll get that to happen now how did that work on the Deaf Pentecost when 3,000 people never got to go through all these time and it's a house of canoe you say they can get to go through the I'm using those quarters in the Bible right what happened they heard one sermon and become saved but you know what happened Satan took away then the knowledge of that and substituted feelings and signs and wonders and sits you know stimulations and all kind of thing you got to do this God do that gonna do this I think gonna get to even of the note so we're forgetting when I will quote one time brother Branham says there's no work in the Bible that it ever said are you speaking in tongues was the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongue but you know what it says every Church age that was what he was emphasizing there's no word in the church ages that it tells you this is speaking in tongues as evidence for Emma but you know ever church age has the same message to it you know what it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith every church age read it every church age has got the same talk to it I just checked him while ago it's in there go read it will you realize what he's saying there's no word it said it and that's why I've always said it this is not the mystery as to the speaking in tongues it's the mystery of the hearing the hearing has always been the mystery how hear we ever man in her own tongue naming all the people of the nations we yet they were here in one language oh but we good Baptists we had it figured out it was about eight nations there and we had it figured out it Peter was talking in seven was interpreting you ever heard that one we had that figured out well that ain't no problem they just had seven interpreters and Peter was talking it doesn't say that said how here we ever man in our own tongue wherein were born the mystery has never been in the speaking the mystery has been always been in the hearing well the mysteries not in - shouting - crying - speaking of the the mystery is - hearing once you hear you have plenty to shout about if not you got a dead baby come on I'm far all emotional things but I'm for the word first get on know what to shout about there's no mystery in hearing I mean in speaking the mysteries in hearing and letting that word be made alive into your heart because that comes out words in salvation is in the soul of mankind it's not in your body in your spirit that's an outward working way to get you understand what I'm saying when it's trying to get across with see every person that's born into the world according to the Prophet you say well okay I just quote him every person he said was born with that desire to serve God he said we answered it by what we were doing of totem poles and animals and this and that and that's why I read that over and there and emphasized that Peter was saying it's not flesh it's not this that the other not silver and gold you're not regained by those things you're not redeemed by your doings in what's taking place you redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ let's see you get the idea that I'm against this and I'm against that I'm for everything that God has got there I want it in the right order yeah that's why you come to me and you said brother Dale do you think I'm saved I can't answer that I can't answer that question you're the one that's gotta answer that question you're the one that's gotta know whether you're saved or not but do you know and do you understand what I'm talking about it's you're sitting in a church maybe somebody preaching now you tell me these well you got to be preaching on this country's don't have this no brother branham would be standing there preaching and preaching the deepest message using you ever thought and the altars would be full of people seeking after God I've tried to explain it to you and you don't listen but how is it God reveals something to you be setting in the preachers preaching on on some you know the predestination or something and all at once right in the middle of it something inside of you says that's why I got saved like sister Gail don't mind me been with her where she tried to figure it out try to do this that in the other word it didn't work within one day standing in the kitchen or somewhere in all at once was this that's one God well brother Gary Atkins he used to we used to talk day-in day-out about the new birth I said brother Gary you're trying your best to figure it out and I said it'll never work you're talking about a man that was living good doing right and tried to do everything he could right I said that's not it brother Gary I said just leave it alone I think you're trying to figure it out you're trying to find out what it is leave it alone he'll come to you one day he called me from we used to talk about the i-20 Battle of Armageddon you know because he's always riding at i-20 going to Alabama back on his he called me he said brother Dale it's over what I didn't have to worry about I need what he's talking about he's now to explain to me what took blood I knew what he's talking about see God had come to him and spoke to him with the only way he could speak to him was from what he had already heard faith cometh by hearing that's why it takes God to condemn you of your sins especially now you young children you think about it and you're saying well well I'm doing this wrong I'm doing this wrong I shouldn't be doing that that can be God dealing with you to get you to come to repentance come to salvation but then here's were they're always I've never taught it no other way than this if you are genuine of God dealing with you he'll keep dealing with you he won't stop he'll keep dealing with you because he that started a good work in you is willing to take you through that's our phrasing was right right see salvation then it's coming from that inward part of you that makes you realize that you are a creation and that for being a creation means they've got to be a creator that created that creation and then that means that that's what's drawing you is that part of you that's why I see brother Branham could preach those people didn't know what he was talking about probably physically in his wordings on a lot of it but when he began to tell him about Jesus Christ he said these Michener's has told you about this they've explained these things to you but said none of you come come on he asked for the girl that was there how many of you been they had one person they'd been over years you know to the country but then when he kept talking about God that Leo is still living God that's real something within their heart begins to long for that and when he did he says now to prove it he said let God come and God came and healed a man and done these different tonight thirty thousand blanket ladies come to Jesus Christ okay but listen jerk do you understand what I'm getting and what I'm trying to get at Wednesday night we talked to the children about salvation but what does they understand and I remember when we was over and I won't say was at a certain place one time and all these kids doctor you know there's a whole bunch of little kids rent her this one little boy he was up on this platform and boy he was just telling I'm off he was a preaching like everything and you know what he was preaching about he said y'all remember when we're back in Pentecost he's about ten years old y'all remember when we're back in Pentecost why because that's what the preacher preached y'all remember when we're back in Pentecost come on jerk get serious about our own matters of everything and realize God must deal with you as an individual that's that soul that he's dealing with you about trying to contact you and getting you to the place of your saying well Lord I'm sorry for what I've done and forgive me and then he begins to work in you of driving out that things that's bothering you we're out of the soul sanctification then comes in it's cleansing that soul burning it out and you even getting you desired new natures new things and you just have repented of your sins you become a cleanse to living by sanctification and you think you've got it the one way that I know whether I've got it or not is one time whatever got me has never stopped wanting me to seek after healing now that's a funny way maybe of saying it but whatever whatever contacted me when I was back there at ten years old I remember that I tried to explain that to people I've even tried to explain it in the people of this message when we come in he saw it I mean yeah what are you trying to you what you trying to be I don't try to be many more you but you see I can remember I've always told you try to be truthful to you that as a sinner I'd go out and do wrong then when I got a quiet moment those things would come up and I'd say Lord I'm sorry and I saw too much of the world of the people that's why I was 18 years old for it even accept Jesus Christ in the Baptist Church because I saw too much wrong with people that claim to be Christians when I realized they were something wrong because I was a sinner and didn't do that that's the church what are we doing what are we teaching our children what are we trying to bring salvation as a what not to get you to quit and don't do getting you to accept Jesus Christ and let Jesus Christ come within you and start working back out and cleansing you and driving out that unclean spirit and then putting the word into there into the soul not in the head in the by you know spirit into the soul bringing that word in the Darr into being as an N we're being as our thoughts and ideas and letting that keep that clean I don't even count the time in the Baptist Church when 18 years old up but I count it when I come in this message that everybody says oh you got it you got it you believe the message I could quote around them hold up better than I can today because that's all I done was read and studied right but you know what I realized I wouldn't born again how many of you ever ever realized that you're lost you know if you can't realize you're lost you can never be saved I mean you're out in the woods y'all are by yourself then you look around and you say I ain't lost I know right where I'm at yeah have you ever realized she's lost because only the word that can God help you and that's why the preaching of the word is so important that's why brother Branham to me when he got over into the life part of the seal that either in questions and answers or it's in the seventh seal he said going with the same simple message he said cause if you don't you work your way from work yourself away from it what's the same simple message when he's preaching across the mystery of God revealed after the opening of the seals that ties the entire Bible together right the one great message that ties everything together what did he teach the new birth he gets the invisible Union a great message on later why did he free the new birth what was he teaching all the way through the new birth what is the seals in the time the new birth see do we see it correctly into that are we trying to teach some other way the run says we're not getting them to Christ we're getting into a doctrine or an idea when do you believe the message yeah I believe the message well you must be saved in if it's in the body in the spirit there's no salvation - if it's coming from the inside we'll get to that we're brother Branham says these virtues everything works from the inside out right comes from the inside out so you got to gets what's right on the inside right and why was Jesus's first doctrine not the seals of the plagues or the vials of this without of the other what was his first doctrine though you must be born again because he knew there was no hope whatsoever of mankind without coming to an end word experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it took him three and a half years to preach it enough that he finally would say do you now believe after all the years and the dead raised the sick healed and all the best you could say do you now believe well boy that's great believers yeah they were they run like a bunch of chickens when it comes to the time to meet the master in the garden right when they come in to capture him they all run even the great Peter I'll stay with me no matter what he said Peter you'll deny me three times for that crock rose or something to that degree he said you're oh I won't deny you he did that's why I like the Bible like it says you know it says when he told him when with our when he'd raised he said go tell my disciples and Peter he wanted Peter to know for certain that everything was alright but yet that he needed some more than what he had because he didn't have enough to carry him through right she don't ever stop seeking God I have never all of my life stop seeking after God ever prayer pray God to help me save me from myself I ain't gonna ask you to save me cuz I'm already saved and if I deny that I'm saved Old Glory with good Baptist I face that then was against it if you got it you don't have to worry about nobody putting it to the test but if you ain't got it you you don't want to be put to no test what do you understand what I'm getting at Wednesday night oh look this guy wanted that dog to come to where we could see that to just say what is the new work just going shameful in baptism I'll go well what is anyway so where's the word well what do you mean the birth of the word see they took the word and held it long enough until it did at least run that unclean thing out of them don't you ever think that you're gonna get rid of the devil either because you better read the future home you better get into the right studies you talk about the unclean spirit being driven out of a man what are you actress driven out oh I'm an empty vessel huh you better get something in place now because if you don't that old Devils coming back you ain't gonna be empty very long right and even all of them things you better be careful cuz the artists where you're anointed ones can come into being in a hurry because they're the the other right they cut out all the things right mm-hmm but they don't have the new bar what about having all of that having your spirit or knowing it with the Holy Spirit one set of genuine yeah brother Dale hey I've seen this I've seen that praise God Matt whoa Paul he said have you received the Holy Ghost hence I believe that's that ought to be preached a lot on Ryan have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed well I got it when I believed have you received it since you believe I like one scripture never have got around to preach on it but it says and we'll get on the statute permit since you shall receive power what after the Holy Ghost is come upon you so we go power that's why I said reducer power power power power power power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you strength serving God but I got it over to bleed yeah come on brothers now I'm still trying my best to get us to see what is the new birth yeah but brother where you gonna put it on the prophet said that Holy Ghost in every age and he said every age is the age of the Holy Ghost and he said ever born-again believer has the same evidence now where are you gonna put it you said well brother Dale we never heard until we come into the message and collect loool especially that the verse is the birth of you know the new birth birds are learned though we always thought it was II thought it was Aldo what does that make it wrong I didn't for months all the profits who want have done it the new birth is a birth through the word he said what we give it to other night God showed the word and he said the Holy Ghost irrigated it right having the word sewn down is good but it's got to be quickened or it's no more than a dead letter right what about it Church do we realize what really the new birth is now watch what it would be its if the evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues what would be the evidence of the headstone would be speaking in tone do you understand you understand one of that prophet I was quoting him one ago that it never says to any age he that speaks in tongue but it says to every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith the evidence has always been in the hearing but do we believe it that away well you're against me code I told you that that when I received the Holy Ghost I cried praise God they've got to be something or you got a dead baby right I believe in experiences I believe it all of the him because you're dead if you don't have them but I don't believe in that first I believe in the birth and then the evidences sometimes that we go with it come on if you're just going to say that this evidences believing to work you'd have to get born again for you believe the word you won't stay all evening preach on that how can the mighty call Jesus the Christ except it be by the hole to go you want to stay all afternoon now to do it kotas that right but you see when we somebody say what an uber squirt what well what do you want me to read I listen to myself over the day we was their life not listening and I said what do you think you need need read Ezekiel get in Ezekiel read that and find out you saying I said you might find out she lost you remember that one Wednesday night so you say well just read Ezekiel you might find out she said you might find out you lost I'll never admit it I'm lost if you got the goods you're not afraid if you got the goods you're not afraid you'll stand before anyone I'm serious I understand I've heard people say you know if brother Branham was here boy I'd cry and repent and I'd do this out of the other before I go before him well why don't you get rid of them thing before you go before anybody well you know what the problem is you afraid he'll call them out well if you got it I'd want him to there was a man that latter one time talking about his discernment you know like that once at it tried to service know without shook his hand I said brother would you do me a favor good one I said anytime the Lord shows you anything about me would you call me and tell me I'm not afraid of your gift because I can be benefited I'm not afraid of somebody calling out my sin it's when you pity patter and won't call them out I'm not afraid for you to say brother Dale you're wrong here wrong here as long as it's wrong are you - stubborn you won't listen that's between me and the Lord and they ain't got
