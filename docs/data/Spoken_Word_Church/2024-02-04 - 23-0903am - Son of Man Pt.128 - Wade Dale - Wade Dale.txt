they're always moving and uh I didn't know why and I looked it up it's because they say because we serve a god that is a action God yeah he is always wanting us to move move in his word you can't stay

also remember brother Dale um and Terence got about the same thing they've got a little stomach problems stomach issues so let's just remember that and remember them also also praise God I don't I I haven't been to the doctor yet but I did get my myar my chart's pretty accurate I would think yeah well the nurses that we too that we have are shaking their head yes but all all 14 biopsies were benign that's right that's what we were looking for that's what brother uh Dy said it's what we were looking for but there was two concerned areas and they um all came back but n so we sure appreciate that appreciate the Lord giving us Grace amen giving us grace and mercy but we sure do appreciate doctors I you know why I was thinking back there there used to be a thing called exploratory surgery right a while back long time ago they'd have to cut you open to find out what was wrong with you I thank God that somebody created a machine MRI CT scan every how they got to go up or down they can find out what's going on without them cutting you open like a like a fish but I I appreciate the the whoever it was I don't care who it was worldly guy or whoever it was these MRIs and CT scans are are well better so the doctors can can help us I sure believe in doctors I know y'all do too we're not against them none whatsoever so but we sure do appreciate the Lord though cuz the great physician is the one that we look at and we see that by his stripes we're already healed so let's go to the Lord in prayer we're going to kind of deviate just a little bit today cuz there's something I want you to I want you to praise God about today we're the elect we're the bride I want us to show that let's bow our heads Lord thank you for being with us today already Lord in song and worship and I pray that You' be with us in the word father you said you sent your word and healed us Lord it may the healing power go from the front all the way to the back and Lord reach out into places like sister sister Freda and mom and dad and sister Johnny and Sister Mary and all the different ones if I forget somebody Lord forgive me but you know who they are Lord that needs you right now and sister tootsy too sister fra sister Tooty being sick we pray that you touch them Lord and raise them up out of that father we thank you for all things we give you praise and honor that you've even let us live another day that we can breathe and breathe freely and live in a country that for now we can Lord be free and and be able to stand in a pull pit and be able to congregate together but Lord there may be a time when that's not going to happen so I pray now Lord that we as you told the prophet that we would put things in our Storehouse today Lord may we fill up our Storehouse as we brought it Lord an empty vessel to use us Lord for your honor and glory and bless your people bless the congregation bless the ones in the Foreign Fields Lord our foreign Brothers Lord we pray that you'd touch them Father today just ever be with us in Jesus name we pray amen we do have a few that still that's going out on vacation and then we've got some that's going on vacation so we we want to keep them in prayer man been some horrible wrecks out around the community so we just want to uh pray the Lord's Mercy on all of us in the beginning was the word this is 128 and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth Jesus answered and said unto them verily verily listen listen I say unto you except the man be born again he cannot see or understand or be a part of the kingdom of God but he's made provision that you can this is what I want to get to today Revelations 19:6 and I heard it as it was the voice now look at all these voice it's one voice not voice says and I heard heard as it word the voice of a great multitude and of the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord omnipotent reth in other words every voice said the same thing every voice said the same thing went to different places thundering Waters but it all came down to one place it's saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice not be sad and downtrodden no let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come that's your new birth remember that happens down here and his wife ha made herself ready down here all right and to her was granted that she should be a raid we look at that word a raid or or clothe or or a garment thrown over us and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness the righteousness it doesn't say of God it says the righteousness of saints you may be seting the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word let's continue on now we know that we've been talking about being born again and and uh some of you have sent messages that they had a good time with this and I I really appreciate um the positive comments sometimes you think man you preaching on a new birth again brother Dale's preached it for 30 40 years and here we are at it again well you know what needs it I may need it I need a refilling so I need I need being born again all right seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again that word being means begot again to produce I like that to produce again you've already produced a new birth God has produced a yourself now what you got to do you got to produce you got to produce produce Christ in other words you got to produce if there's oranges in your the life of the orange plant you got to produce oranges all right so if you got the life of God in you we are going to have to produce the life of God not just on Sunday and Wednesday not just part of our life uh you know our graph shouldn't look like this our CH our Christian walks we sure it is but it shouldn't look like that our Christian experience should be that it carries us to everything and even though we have a bad day or a good day it really doesn't matter we're heading in another Direction being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible what is a seed that is the word of God so it's being born again by what non nontruth cannnot produce a seed of God all right and nontruth is not of God we'll get to that in just a few minutes down in the church ages there was a lot of nontruth that was not God but he allowed that to happen in Luther's age Wesley's age even in Columba and different ones he allowed that to happen but he said it would come back to Incorruptible it would come back to full word in the end time and we'll get to that in just a second by the word of God so how are you being born again by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever like I said that word means to produce again be born again are born a new in the message you must be born again brother Brown said look God bless his word and I want to take the subject this morning to Jesus's first Doctrine now what was his first Doctrine you must be born again that was his first Doctrine and we find out that there's so many different meanings that people put to it that's what we've been talking about nearly all churches say You must be born again there's not any religion that says well you just need to just no there's a there's a method I guess you might say to some people that to get born again but it can't be a Creed it can't be a Dogman it can't be false Doctrine all right it's got to be the word of God nearly all churches say You must be born again but each one has their different interpretations what it means to be born again now remember to be born again as we were saying before it's not got anything to do with a feeling with an emotion that's right it's an experience you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God all those Creeds don't change you all your coming to church don't change you listening to tapes don't change you the letter kth Spirit giveth life that's what we'll look at here in just a few minutes cuz cuz when we in this statue of a perfect man it's got to be the spirit truth everything's got to come together all right for everything to come together we've got to be as the prophet of God told us to be honed all right and then and then um Iron has got to fit iron iron can't fit rubber so you got to have the same in other words The Life of Christ is what's growing up and guess what's coming down as a headstone it's the Life of Christ all right so we need to get if we have to let's get back to that let's live the life of Christ all right then all these Mysteries that we're talking about and the voice that we're hearing will be the one that'll take us out of here yes sir you're still what you were until you actually born again of the spirit of God doesn't change you your Creed join a church change your idea our good intentions although as good as that might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen remember brother Brown tells us he said that Luther and Wesley couldn't in other words couldn't get full word because they were reformers now churches that don't have uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost they are reformers can you nod just a little bit louder it's rough Bob you you're supposed to plow this field before me there's something got to happen the new birth is an experience something that takes place so something did happen in Luther's age but yet God still had to wink at his ignorance when he said we still need to be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost cuz that's what the mother Church said and we don't know any different we're going to come out the just yall live by faith we don't have to live by Creed we don't have to live by the um by the Catholic church or the dogmas but then Luther said okay well that's it then but God said no Luther that's not all of it that's not full word that's part of the word you got to move on further and then brother Brown said what they all cabbaged down he even he talked about the Pentecostal they all cabbaged down they all stopped as brother Joe was talking about the Wailing Wall if you'll look at them I mean they're moving why because God's in motion God's moving all the time listen in the Garden of Eden when the Masterpiece I'll read it to you in just a minute brother B said when the Masterpiece fell on its face he said God immediately began working to get that thing standing back up right again so praise God that he still working on me but it's a new birth is an experience something that takes place so it is not that that brings a new birth in other words decrees and dogmas now the different churches say well accept this or believe this I don't want to accept anything Satan can get you to accept anything but when God comes in and burns that old you out and you say oh what a change in my life amen I have new thoughts oh yeah those old thoughts are still there but I've got new thoughts the word has become more alive not like y'all dead is a hammer something ought to be sparking inside if it's not sparking Inside by now then we need we need more than walking all over we need to get over get over ourself everybody's looking around at everybody else saying well he's not saying amen so I'm not going to say amen that's never bothered me one bit Hebrews 11:39 said all these having attained a good report talking about the Old Testament listen we're standing here in a real small microcosm of of this plan of God right I mean we're right here in the moment 2023 we're standing here September the whatever it is the third all right now we are standing in a day where you say well it's you know it's good weather outside we got tomorrow off and y'all ought to be praising God just for that those of you that work those of you that don't praise God anyway amen but we're standing in this this one little day but every believer this is what I want you to get today this and another thing I want to bring out today every believer every powerful Paul irenius Martin Columba think about this Luther Wesley William brandham is that a place waiting on us to come to a place even the Old Testament Saints cuz they received not the promise now the ones I just told you they received the promise but they didn't receive full promise because it wasn't in their full time to have it you and I are in the full time that that voice is what's going to call us out of here not out of a denomination or out of a Creed but out of this world yes sir and they're not going without us that's right God having provided some better thing listen folks this is that better thing that they without us should not be made perfect absolutely brother Brown said now in Blasphemous name said I believe the reason that there's so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit now look if there's a confusion it's about the holy spirit all right cuz if you don't get the Holy Spirit and you don't get the new birth inside your soul Daniel 70 weeks the seals will never open to you never open to you without the new birth you will never get a correct revelation of these end time truths or Mysteries without it without the new birth we're nothing we are confused yes sir right there's so much confusion today about the holy spirit it's not correctly taught that's why I believe that baptism is taught says just a baptism in other words just throw it out there it's a blanket thing it's not listen it's the life of God yes sir that changes your old life your old nature doesn't just throw you away and hide you somewhere now he kills it when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that and we've been talking about it for the past several weeks there's a lot goes with that because here in Ezekiel thank God again for a prophet that told us about this new heart that God's going to give us a a new attitude he's going to give us a new way of thinking he's going to give us come on I mean he said he's Tau he went right to the heart yes right to the thing that if it quits beating you're done doesn't matter how sharp the rest of it is you have a heart attack you're gone right okay without some medical help or what more so a new heart will I give give you and a new spirit see God was he's the he's the one that have you ever thought about this there's nothing new Under the Sun right there's nothing new there's nothing that man has come up with that God or the devil hadn't already thought of that's right and I want to put him in there too amen so these MRIs CT scans all that stuff they can do outside your body without opening you up God's been doing it since the dawn of time abolutely God's been Wireless forever he's never he's never needed a connection he just needs you to be what be a willing receptor yes sir he's healed people hallu and never even make an inch cut so nothing new Under the Sun man has just what tapped into God's laboratory and said hey we can take these unseen waves compress them together or what more are these M you know if we're a light and magnetic images and they come up with all and that's great fine with me that's okay like I said better than cutting you over open like a fish and said oh there's nothing wrong so you back up but I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh has he done that has he softened us up I want you to think about you I'll think about me like Bob said judge yourself you go now if we judge our s righteous then we can judge cuz we are going to be the judge it's like brother Dell's always said if he was if he was standing at the point of casting the first stone he'd have to cast the first stone why why judgment starts where House of God all right but you're going to take the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh in other words something you can work with and I will put my spirit within you now there is the holy spirit there is when God burns your old nature out and what vulcanize his soul hello somebody his soul with your soul yes sir that's the Creator that's the man that can produce anything that he says he's inside of you today about the new birth or he's not that's right and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to want to come to church cause you to want to read your Bible cause you to want to do right we're going to read here in just a minute where we've been we've stopped at it for many many times about the statute of perfect man there in second Peter we'll read it we'll get to it maybe this afternoon it' be this afternoon sorry but where brother where brother Peter says that if you do these things it'll make you yes make you you can't Happ it come on amen that's what I want I want where I can't Happ it why do you praise the lord I can't Happ it why do you shout I can't help it there's something inside of me that says amen there's something inside of me says let me out and show the world cuz the world sees enough junk that's what I said before even even out in the world be kind to people be nice be nice this world is like Bob said so cruel it is the most cruel why cuz there's no spiritual Rudder there's no even in the churches there's no what they call Christianity Today would have never made it in an old timey Church Never Would Have Made It they'd have called you a dog and a devil for what they call Christianity now are we caught up with it though are we caught up the same way and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but T in a city of Jerusalem or t wherever you want t t here until you be endued or put on like a garment now what did it say in Revelations 19 the bride has made herself ready in other words she has clothed herself listen the armor meat packing guy did not come and clothe that woman that he went to pick up that's right right amen she cled herself she was waiting ready on the porch oh he's coming yeah y'all just as as mom was talking to somebody a doctor one time a doctor friend of hers and she's a a good Pentecostal lady but she said oh and this is to me just listen to what I'm saying she's looking at Mom and sees the Holiness and she sees that that Mom she's and she's supposed to be a Christian herself and she says oh you believe all the Bible I'd have said what part don't you believe are you a Christian but that's what the world is they look at you and they go oh you're from that Old testate Bunch are you from that Old Pentecostal Bunch well praise God they saw a difference some of y'all maybe they won't even see a difference in but praise God if they do until you be endued are clothed with power or dunamus from on high and that dunamus is God's power and that dunamus is an inherent power it's something you get and keep now remember he gave them power see he gave Luther power he gave Wesley power come on people he even gave Columba power he gave them power over evil spirits now this is the disciples before the Holy Ghost fell on on the day of Pentecost and Judas was standing there with them that's right he gave them power or exos sea which is a temporary power give it to you take it away from you give it to just like an anointing anoints you to do something and then take it right away from you cast out Devils heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases he just he just laid the blanket out and said hey go that's right and Judas was right there with them but Judas didn't carry on he didn't believe the word to its fullness but excellia Power will give you Authority all right but like brother Bob was say we've read it many many times but if you really just break it down that Pro that brother R says power without character so see God's not going to give you a whole bunch of power if he knows you're going to start zapping people out of the way you know cars will be driving by their s so me never mind do away with with them Lord they cut me off and here goes a car with nobody in it my boss oh he's gone see that's power without character but Power with character you pray for the person cuz they don't know no better they haven't been taught have you ever invited them to church now you can get quiet cuz you can't say Amen to it h have you invited them to church my enemies yeah remember I got two gay guys Liv beside me and I have invited them to church but you shall receive power after cuz remember before you're powerless you may have this great strength and this great ability Earthly but without receiving power from on high or dous power you're just a wimp absolutely now look right let's see this right here and this is where I want to kind of I want to talk to us just a few minutes kind of a little side note and I'll read you a statement that that I believe the lord gave me while I was cutting grass brother Ryan I'm back on the lawnmower again but it's my personal one so I'm cutting my own grass but but the lord gave a gave me a powerful statement and I'm going to go ahead and state it to you and then I'll read it to you in just a minute but you know I was thinking I thought the devil's been doing this you know working in our communities and in our bodies making us sick making us backslide but do you know one thing's for sure I'm going to read it to you after I read all this I'm going to read it again read that and you're looking at us never never since Jesus Christ was on this Earth has Satan ever had such a formidable opponent we have his answer yes sir he don't know how to deal with us but never before that's why it's a headstone message that's why the message had to come it brings Jesus Christ back to Earth and a bride not coming on White Horse that's Revelations 19 that's after everything's over with but anyway let's go back over here and then I'll read it to you again but I'm going to tell you how brother BR said look Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts you say brother way what's this got to do with the statute of perfect man has everything to do with it you got to realize who you are and what you're doing here you got to realize that God is working through your life yes sir bringing these virtues into your life not another group that's coming oh we're just setting groundwork listen there was somebody that did say one time I'm just setting groundwork this is the building this is not the groundwork this thing has come off the foundation and it's a building yes sir how let the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless we see it everywhere listen to this in Revelation of Jesus Christ now that is the Revelation Jesus Christ is god Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there's three Gods but it also takes a revelation to make you understand that truth all right so it takes Revelation all right I mean how can you see this God that can be everywhere do everything be a father Son and Holy Ghost and be one person cuz see I can be a father a son and a human being but I can't be inside of you or I can't be in California I don't want to be in California I can't be in Alaska right but God can cuz he omnipotent I'm I'm the present omniscient he's all those he's God absolutely but it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one he takes a revelation to see that the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth Satan crept into the church and when they were blinded to it which means they accepted it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stop baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are We Done Yet no watch this Resurrection 1953 see I don't want to blame you people it's the pull pits where it started amen no wonder that's the damnation of the country when Satan got in the pull pit it's the truth failing to preach the unadulterated word of God and the word of God will produce just exactly what it said it would do but we explain it all away oh it's for some other day or as for some other group H masterpiece 1964 listen to this this is a good one now notice then this masterpiece when Satan got a hold of it the deceiver he broke through the walls and he marred this masterpiece we know what he did because that that's the way he did it what how did he do it I'll go more in detail of it remember he's talking about the serpent Seed doctrine how he done it this masterpiece was walled by the word God's word and the Masterpiece Exel ex of the family was fortified by his word all right remember Eve was Adam's bride in type being the bride of Christ right she fell cuz she got out from behind the word of God but the broken part that was broken off of the original he's talking about Eve went out beyond that wall now we're talking about a church now not exactly just Eve we're talking about church went out beyond that wall it gives Satan a chance to Mar and now as you know what I believe on these things talk about serpent seed but watch but the great sculptor thank God for a prophet he didn't leave us out somewhere he didn't throw us out in the ditch didn't leave us out on the limb no he gave us some rope to pull it back watch but the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruined he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is God and he will not be defeated I'll clap anyway he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again and to his own image a man now we know who that man was it was Jesus Christ all right now look Harvest Time 1964 the prophet of God says then Eve met her failure so did the church now watch so did the he keep saying church so did the church so did the church gave away the denomination rules of man to be ruled by man not controlled by the spirit no more she went away away from the word and accepted dogmas who can say Amen congregation says amen but do you know we Protestants accept as many dogmas as they got I'm talking to the message Believers today when we add something to this word or take something from it Satan got her with his same old technique he did Eve compromising that's where he got it and something different from the said something different from the word a Creed or denominations pergan Church age how can you tell the spirits apart he talking about the two spirits in the framework of the church just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one pay attention as the evil one deceived the first two bride you said who is that Eve and Israel got it Eve and Israel he had divorce he had to put he had to put Israel away to get me and you right now what have we done with it he will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creeds are just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her amen but God never plac signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when Elijah took the woman told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said we ought to try that sometime when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the Miracles the seed word is energized by the spirit How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of the word and deny some of it the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word yes sir denominations will hate him praise God his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear yes sir amen and be ready for the Rapture the Royal Seed of Abraham with like Faith as Abraham will hold onto the word with him for they are predestinated together now on the first seal now he's coming to the seals now he's getting ready to the seals are getting ready to open and watch what he says now watch he said it would be known in the last days but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it Church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they though know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse right writer and it only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church he keeps saying church but now watch notice oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people he stops he stops something strikes him he says I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it amen hlj I'm going to call you bride in other words I'm going to separate you from all this I've been talking about a church cuz out of the church will come a bride I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it well who's going to understand it just the bride Christ mystery God revealed listen this then we stand justified in the presence of God as a drop of in dropping into a tub full of bleach you'll never find the stam s that ain't no more how many believe that you better than you still got your sin it went somewhere it'll never come back again and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished it's gone it's separated it's dropped in the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ never to be remembered God forget get it and he stands as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God Amen and amen now we are the sons of God not we will be we are now we are redeemed now listen to this we have Satan's answer yes sir there's your answer yes sir we're an opponent that he can't stand but we're an opponent that's not going to fail amen God has Vindicated himself God proves himself to this promise in this day Hallelujah the headship is here talk about the opening of the seals amen Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer Oneness 1962 love this sermon the kingdom of God is the word of God made back in power we look for all kind of the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is the word of God made back into power so that's my statement I was thinking I thought never since Jesus Christ was on Earth has Satan had such a formidable opponent he swept a lot of good people sorry that all those people are waiting on us some under false Doctrine hello but they're waiting on the perfect one well see remember the Old Testament was waiting on the the perfect one too right Jesus Christ well when he showed up there was the perfect one so now where is he at now oh no he's still in back there in the church ages or he's in heaven or he's over there somewhere no he's in his bride he's not in a church he's in a bride yes sir all right so never has Satan had such a formidable opponent than the Bride of Jesus Christ do you believe that yes sir I did I did circles in the yard sir that's right right when you try to put the holy spirit in a denomination you can't get a splutter or a splutter you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but oh I'm so glad that there's a 10,000 octane power the word of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up you got to have the two and to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that shoved that Cadillac down the road under the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved over the people at the day of Pentecost that's 2,000 years ago making him the same yesterday today and forever yes sir there was the first sheath come up from all the prophets which was the Son of God the king of all prophets we quote this many times but I believe it more and more today there have been churches churches Brides brides there's been a bride in every age all right there's been a bride in every age seven of them Seven Ages is already almost passed the seventh one Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride yes sir that one that has not only mechanics but Dynamics makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection I pray that that's our our our goal our goal is not to sit in a garage and rust and R until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do the Polish The Hub in other words what good does it do for you to come to church if you're not going to do what the word says and the ones of you that don't come to church every once in a while you need to get born again what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proves to be right there has got to be a dynamic to make it work Revelations 10:7 says but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared in other words a voice yes sir has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake un me again The Voice through this message this message has give us a voice there's been many voices many brides many churches many denominations but there's one remember that's why is a mystery you got to hear the voice to get the mystery all right everybody with me cuz you got to take let's take Paul for a minute we we've went through this many times but Paul goes and he's getting ready to just destroy the Christians he's he's on his horse he's on his his high horse and he's heading toward on the Damascus Road he's heading to put Christians in jail and to cause them to blaspheme to kill them right right all of a sudden there's a bright light knocks him off his horse but there's a voice that speaks to Paul Paul or Saul he said at the time Saul Saul why are you persecuting me now the Bible tells us in several scenarios same way with Jesus when there was a voice from Heaven said many heard the Thunder many Saw The Light many heard something but they didn't hear the voice Paul heard Paul heard the voice listen others heard other things is that what we've been do for 60 years hearing other things cuz I remember we I here in Revelations 19 there was a promise that that voice was going to take us and make us the bride mature bride all right so in a sermon or or you watch or listen to a tape it doesn't matter no matter how loud I can scream only the elect is going to hear the voice of God as we've said before many people y'all all set in meetings and I told you we set I don't mean meetings I mean right now there's you're going to get 15 minutes of sermon you're going to get your 15 everybody's going to get their different what you need of a sermon but how many people hear the full word of the day and it impacts them that way you think about it you don't have to amen you can ow me all you want to if you want to do that that's fine but only a few hear the word for their day others just hear a voice a voice it says in the days of the voice you and I have heard if you've heard the word of God for the end time you've heard the voice of God yes sir why did we need it we needed it for maturity Brides brides voices voices voices voices but there's one you better decide whether you're hearing the right Voice or not it doesn't matter if it comes from me brother Bob brother Aaron doesn't matter that the vessel at that moment doesn't matter go and I heard it as it were the voice of a great multitude now John is typing who the bride he hears a voice and then the voice of many Waters and then the voice of Mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come yes and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints listen to this real quick 1961 the comforter we have a great heritage a great sacred trust that's been given us you might wonder now brother brandham you're talking about sunshine great Sunshine of God's glory to make Healthy Spirits to make us strong Christians that's what we're here to find out tonight in other words how do we get these things how do they come where do they come from what are they show me what it is brother brandom can I buy it at the drug store what kind of a vitamin is it you don't buy this in a drugstore but there is plenty of it right close to you if you'll just receive itall it's just knowing the formula how to receive it there'd be drugs in a drug store but there's got to be a doctor you don't just walk in a drugstore and say hey give me some you know on that wall give me some of them pills no you have a prescription right what is that prescription that is your protection cuz the doctor's diagnosed your case he has found out what needs to be done he writes not 45 different Vo I mean prescriptions right usually they'll just give you one per sheet right so that's what you've been given now watch there'd be drugs in a drug store but there's got to be a doctor to diagnose the case if he didn't it might kill you so therefore you've got to have a diagnosis of the case you just can't go and take a sinner and give him the Holy Ghost amen he's got to repent first he's got to be washed his sins away he's got to be prepared for this vitamin that's going to be given him yes sir now we have a sacred trust you know what a trust is we have an inheritance a Heritage that we inherit as believing children it's a sacred trust and that sacred Trust and our sacred Heritage look it's the word of God that's not been given to Luther but it's been given to us the full word of God the word itself is the vitamin the word itself God's word that's where a reason I'm so dogmatic as I would call it on standing on this word no matter what anything else says if it's not with the word I don't believe it am see if you want to believe it that's all right but to me it takes the word cuz heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail therefore it takes the word then we coming to the Token because we're coming up statue of perfect man and we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ and our token that all that we have need of is already purchased by him yes we are identified yes sir with our token the token must be ready the blood Covenant blood is not recognized without the token now he's going to tell us what the token is the word assures us of that promise the token is the sign what is the token the two pieces of paper you and the two pieces of paper fit together they fit right back together just like that all right the token is the sign the purchase has been made for us full obedience watch this is where my thought was talking about the full word of God full obedience to part of the word of God does not entitle us to the Token of the end time but full obedience to the full word of God that's why we don't live in the Old Testament we live in both of them the full word of God yes what happened in the Garden of Eden we know what Abraham did body change we've got all these great Revelations what are we doing with it you're sitting here half asleep that's what you're doing with it grief you be setting up if your favorite Netflix what that brother say series was on no other way is there that you could ever look be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word fully not what somebody has put into it and added to it but what God said about it yes sir when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar that don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done boy he's pretty plain isn't he it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means Death to Your First being yes sir and Life to your second being it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ and if he be the vine then we be the branches the life that's in the branch is in the vine it Bears the fruit so I want to ask you a question today let's stand to our feet y'all can't stay awake we'll just close and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you started believing this message and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be a holy ghost you can't say that you can't say that Ephesians 4:29 says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all malice be ye kind one to another as brother Bob had that list up there uh it's just a reverse of what people are in the end time I mean a total reverse of this world and even their thinking all right be put away from you with all malice and be you kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even for even even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you then I'll stop right here musicians come on possession the enemy's Gates brother R said now be real reverent everybody now just be real reverent we've been we've already read this quote I'm going read it again cuz I I believe in the moving of God but I believe in the moving of God as brother Brandon believed in the moving of God Amen be still be quiet let God speak see the holy spirit is so timid how many knows that just real timid Holy Spirit just any little Interruption bothers him amen you want to bother the Holy Spirit interrupt him every once in a while we'll talk about the rest of the gifts going up the statue of perfect man but I want you to see Paul even Jesus you know the some heard it thunder some heard many different things some saw many different things right but God didn't specif didn't come down and just you know if you would have been uh uh they probably now I say this just probably Moses is walking home with his stick in his hand he's 80 years old he's walking home through the desert and he looks out there and there's a bush and it's just burning red it's just like it's burning up well they may have been Shepherds and all kind of people around different places and they may have looked at it and thought man this is said that thing's going to burn up and turn around walk off but Moses something drew Moses Moses got close to it and the bush spoke to him nobody else heard that voice Moses take off your shoes right then you know when somebody tells you to take your shoes off that's somebody in Authority that's not somebody just hiding behind the bush that's God and he did everything God told him to do take your shoes off not now remember brother R said God would have never spoke to Moses if he said now now Lord It's Hot this this Sand's hot I I think I'll just take my hat off no God said take your shoes off you take your shoes off God tells us to do the things of God we better start doing the things of god let's sing a song God bless you we'll we'll start this afternoon right here for I hold my life to him for
