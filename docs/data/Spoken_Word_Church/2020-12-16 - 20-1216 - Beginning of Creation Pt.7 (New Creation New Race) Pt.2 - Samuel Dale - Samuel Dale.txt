time in you and we pray that you would just take care of us and guide us as this year ends out we're looking forward to another year not looking forward to time but looking forward to the basis of what you promised because the the way that we believe in the way we see that the thing is opening now to where that we can follow in the word and be led by your love and see where we're exactly at right now so that's our our opportunity our hopes is all addressed upon that one thing have your way just be with each one member the sick ones among us and remember the one like sister rita that lost her husband and just be with them in the services there tonight and all of the things the viewings and just the service tomorrow we pray that you would just have your way forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in thy grace and love in jesus name amen remember we're reading this because this is the age that we're in is this lady will see an age all right and unto the angel of the church of the lady of siam's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now remember we're going trying to cover the beginning so that's the message to this age the beginning of the creation of god all right so as we transfer from one to the other follow that that we're all in the basis of a new creation a new race if we'll just understand it okay let's go to second corinthians just pick up one scripture 5 17. therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new amen you may be seated lord at his blessing remember over in the book of revelations it's it covers how that all things are made new well then here we read here in corinthians that all things are made new so then we should be uh getting to a place or seeing at least the hour and the day that we're here now i i want to refer back just a little bit to the couple of messages back when we preached you know and talking about the overcomer and and all of the things and i want you to think about all that uh we tried to cover we we tried to bring out that uh you know we we want to see things in a positive attitude positive right now you realize where we're at right now that's what my point was and that whole message was to get us to see that if we could be back there in in hitler's time you know we could say we we saw that we we we lived in that time mussolini's time the the world and all of the things were the things the prophet saw that would take place you realize that there's people in this building that has lived through that you know some younger ones some older ones but still living that thing it's not something that we're looking forward to we've done seen these things transpire all right and the prophet got in there remember and he brought it out and he came down to the number five in the division and and he said now five of these things has been fulfilled well the fifth one was the car and the situation and all and you and i have experienced that we've lived our time and we've seen the volkswagen come into view we've seen the the roads made for to be able to drive without a steering wheel or anything we've seen a lot of those things transpire in our day well we ought to be happy to say we are in the bible you remember i kept asking the question through that service can you put your experience in the bible can you i mean can you really just think about where you're at well if i could find my name written there i like the way we was listening the other night to the prophet when he said uh he said when the bible says whosoever he said i'm glad it says that he said because if it said william branham he said there's other william branhams well it said when it says whosoever said then that's me well all right then that's the way we should think about our christian experience as to living things in our lives right now he said well boy wouldn't it be great to be back there with the apostles and and and all of the things wouldn't it be great to to stand in the hour of a lot of that like the book of acts and the great things to take in place well why would you want to go back why not stand here and believe the same god well not believe the same things were taking place when i just see those things and see how it's doing yeah but i just don't see well that's what i've emphasized to you through that message that a lot of you your kids you wouldn't be old enough to know about hitler what you've heard about him you can get videos and documentaries and all kind of things about him that would be just a little prior to your age but then some of the the adults into that age we'd fit into that bracket to actually maybe lived some of you during the times of world war one world war ii yeah and and you know experiencing those things to actually live it and that's a wonderful opportunity to be able to see that and he said i gave you the quotes where he said five of the things has transpired all right what did he say number six was he said a woman in the white house said maybe the catholic church what said maybe uh vice president or president or that he put them both there in to where we can see that you and i have experienced that we've come up in an age now where there's a woman in the white house you don't rejoice to think about that that the the god has told us ahead of time what would transpire that doesn't thrill you to be able to uh be able to pick up a newspaper and read tomorrow's news today you know you know what i'm talking about to where that we could see the things that's transpiring is written right in the word of god in order to make our hearts rejoice to be able to comprehend something before it ever takes place right and to see it all right see i wanted you to see that i wanted you to to tie it together with with the things that where we are because my way of seeing things i i i look at things in a positive attitude because when i look at it in a negative you know well when i look at it at all if you're not going to look at it positive if you're not going to believe he's hebrews 13 8 while we're about to rest to believe and see the very moment that we're living is right in the scriptures being made manifest right now on the earth and i like what the prophet said about it he said uh and the lord jesus said of what they say the last seven hours i believe that's right now but anyhow it's the last few hours of before there in in calvary taking place he said that fulfilled the biggest portion of the scriptures was right there and he went back and quote in the old testament scriptures they pierced my hands my feet they've done this that the other and see he could rejoice to see that he could comprehend that those things had taken place well can you do that that's why i kept asking the question do you believe hitler was here do you believe mussolini happened do you believe the car came do you believe the the things were taking place do you believe that there's a woman in the white house a vice president or president no you say well that was a catholic church now i ask you a question about it and then i'll get away from it you say oh that's a catholic church well it was a time you used to be looking for a woman i'm too old for you to play with me about it i remember talking with you about it and us discussing it and talking about a woman in the white house we wasn't interested in the catholic form of in the white house we was interested in the woman in the white house all right but see now you have the woman and the catholics in the white house now you have them both you have everything there's no reason for us to deny to doubt anything that was said by the prophet because it's transferred right before us but what i'm saying is we was looking at it like a woman and not looking at the catholic right coming down people would do it see i live through this i hope you think about the days you lived through it and what you've been through that people didn't talk about the catholics in the white house they talked about the woman coming into the white house well now she's there but you see god does it in some a marvelous way until he put them both right in together the woman and the catholics you don't you don't that don't throw you that don't give you an understanding that god thought enough of you to tell you about these things and what was going to take place before they ever took place that he sent a man with dust saith the lord that's right amen amen that's right to tell us all of these things that don't make you feel good what makes me feel good is my father thought enough of me to tell me these things you don't think anyway you don't think that your father almighty god made a way in this last days for us to be able to see these things and see them right in our in front of us transfer i mean just walk right up to the white house and say there it is see so what are we going to do now well as i said we were looking for the woman in the white house now the woman's in the white house what are we going to do now well oh but that's not the woman in the this is not the woman uh it's the catholic church in the white house see you turn it right back around you're doing what i said the joke was made when it started out about the woman in the white house and how that i won't call her name because there's no need to call her names but she was running for president but she wasn't too pretty and everybody started a big life and joking way of things talking about well that can't be the one he's talking about because he said a beautiful woman said that woman ain't beautiful a joke has this gospel become a joke are you looking at it as pro present positive perfect tense to see it right among you or if i'd have just been back there no according to the prophet if we say if we'd just been back there he said whatever you're doing now is what you'd have done then is that right now whatever we're doing we would have done then all right let's get serious about it okay because i'm looking at it as positive as as something that is more real to me today this message means more to me today than it ever has in my life because i'm seeing it made alive i'm seeing it living in people i see it making manifest why would you prophet say it like that see he said a vice president well i mean we know the channels but why didn't he say a president a woman president i will tell you what he went on and said if you'll listen and read he went on and said the woman to be the controlling factor so it don't matter who the president is the woman has got the control in power she's the one right she's in office right well we still got a little bit of time over what february jennifer or something but what are you going to do you're going to try to get in the ark do you remember what the prophet said he said some of those people were serious people would listen another night to it he said some of those people were serious people he said you know what they went up to where the ark was because they even said now we know that if the door closes noah is a good man and he'll open the door and let us in now that's that's what your prophet said is that the way we are oh everything's going to be all right brother dale you're a doomsday i'm not doomsday i'm very very proud you can't you can't be a doomsday uh thoughts of things and be excited about it right i mean you're excited about getting your head blowed off no no don't go that way you don't get excited over that you get excited when you realize those things happening right now that has been promised for 6 000 years we're not looking for whether hitler would come into view or not we're not looking where the mussolini's or whatever it would be we're looking at what the prophet said thus saith the lord she's in the white house okay now if the woman's in command what does it matter who this first guy is if she's a second you understand what i'm saying why would the prophet say vice president why didn't he go right straight president because you know why that's too much that's too too hard so the woman's going to have to ease herself in the white house as the vice president but she's going to rule the show when it's all finished where are we going to be okay i'm just one thing that i'm thankful for all things that my savior has shown me that my god has over the years shown me that i've not fallen after all of these flim-flam things this went about in the message that's what i said you get people you go back there and think about it some of your older ones when they get up and they say well this can't be that woman in the white house because she's still too ugly that was more important to them then than the gospel of the fact of realizing that in just a few years you would be living those things you would be fulfilling those things right in your life i'm going to say it but forget what i'm saying about it i ain't saying well you voted it because some of you probably did vote for it that's your opinion that ain't nothing to me that ain't got nothing to do with that that's natural that's natural points that's that's but what about voting to put in see that's why i quit voting when i learned this message and said who was when did he run on kennedy when was the last time 63 or something got killed you know but i never voted since then on a presidential election why because i read where the prophet said one of those visions they would deal with a president coming into office by the women's votes and the things i'm just reading it today and since that when i found out what they've done with john l kennedy i never voted since then because ain't no need of it come on you've lived some of you've lived long enough to realize that when they even uh the edgar hoover wouldn't the ones that he tried to bring it out but they couldn't even bring it out when he was devoting for one you were automatically voting for the other person and they knew it you think i'm gonna vote anymore like i said in that message the other day when i began to hear the message and and the prophet was talking about i didn't run to see about the women's run but i began to study as much as i could to find out and i found out that this was like 1967. give or take a little that at that time there was 1500 catholics in the white house appointees and things like that that a lot of them was appointed for life see that was what i was interested in i was interested in seeing how the catholic's going to get in the wild i wasn't concerned about the woman i was concerned about the catholics and i never voted no more i ain't saying anything wrong with your voting see that's where you'll do that in your mind and then you'll build your good case well i think i've proved my point all the way down to where i've stood for and what i've stood for and the things that i've based it on from the day one of this message here in this church until where we are now because you know what the message was going beyond man's camp that was the first sermon i preached in this message was going beyond man's camp and by the way if you'd like to have a whole section of cassette tapes that probably you could find them everyone from 82 back because there's about six boxes downstairs of cassette tapes you're welcome to every one of them if you don't get them we're going to burn them because we ain't got nowhere to put them we're going to trash them if we don't do it if you want them go down there and get every one of them if you want to know what i preached in 1975 go down there and look through those boxes and you'll find it i guess i should really take them and bundle them up and set them up somewhere just in case but i ain't worried about it because hey most of you have been here long enough to know what i've preached in 75. see a lot of you know what in 1974 when i said you could pass night the year 2026 and not break the prophet's word do you want the tapes they're downstairs welcome to them because like i said if you don't we're going to take them to the trash pile we can't leave them sitting down there all right okay now let's get on with the message the next message or the last part that i was trying to bring about the message that i've been endeavoring to bring on the beginning of the creation i covered a little part there that i want you to go back with me and think about these things and if you'll go to that tape you'll find that i covered stage one and stage two to a degree and then left it because i did not have enough time at that time to get to stage three uh so that's even the statement in the message there all right now covering the beginning of creation that's what i like i picked that that's random that's very wordy the scripture says beginning of the creation of god what brother branham called it says beginning of creation all right see then revelation 3 14 has a threefold understanding to it the beginning of the creation of god has a threefold understanding to it stage one was god coming into creation himself making himself known all right stop now i'm going to pick that up in a minute but i want to go on stage two covers the coming into being of the word that was made flesh in the body of the lord jesus christ being the beginning of the creation the body all right stage three which we didn't get to is the the new creation which is what i read the scriptures there in corinthians he's a new creature if you're a born again believer tonight you're a new creature you're not an old creature made over you're a new creature in christ jesus all right if i don't get to that we'll finish it up on that part but i want you to think about it because stage one now i tried to cover it in the message if you'll listen you'll see that i brought it up but i was walking very slowly because i couldn't find the right way and i said there a couple of times that i'm trying to find a way to present this to what did i see but i want to start off with presenting it like this let's just read what your prophet says on two or three things and then make some comments so go ahead brothers we're number one on the now i gave you these before so don't worry too much about it questions and answers on genesis now look what he says and no man has seen the father at any time no man can see god in the bodily form because god is not in bodily body form that's why it'll clear up the scriptures where god is a spirit and they that worship him but he's it's not a spirit like a spook floating around he's a being he's a person but i want you to catch something in a minute when you get through for just a little bit of the message and you'll see what i've been driving at and even gaining ground on my own no man can see god in the bodily form because god is not in body form god is a spirit see all right no man has seen the father scripture right no man can see the father the son has to declare him you can't see the father because he's spirit all right see he's spirit right now even though he's went through the forms and everything he's still the holy spirit that's within your heart right see all right no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father hath declared him first john now but notice now there's nothing there's just space all right now hold on to what we're getting here read that very carefully and listen listen to what's being said now but this is a specific time that we'll get to in a second when we're reading but now notice now there's nothing there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it just seems nothing okay but in there is a great supernatural being jehovah god who covered all space of all places at all times he was from the from everlasting from everlasting he is the beginning of creation now listen there was a time that god was self-existing right that's the elohim right the understanding self-existing he dwelt alone nobody was back there with him we wasn't back there as little bitty people as the mormons believed running around up in heaven with god no he wasn't there if he's self-existing then he's self-existing does that need interpretation when you say self-existing that means he's by himself all right but don't no don't take him so far until you take him clean out of the story because that's what we want to get to all right that's god can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move or an atom in the air not nothing not no iron no no nothing but yet god was there that was god now let's watch for a few minutes and after a while no man has seen that now that's the father that's god the father all right a self-existing he existed alone there was nothing with him no light no night no day no darkness no this no father son and holy ghost and this that and the other no no no it was god dwelling alone brother branham said god was lonely i love that he said that's what he'd done in the garden he's because adam was lonely so he took part and made eve so what did god do god was lonely so he started a condescending down toward mankind to where that he could be understood he didn't become another person a second person coming into view or third person or anything like that he was almighty god himself all the way from the beginning the self-existing one i wish i could get it together when i was listening to him today when he was saying that that the people believing in evolution he said how come it ain't evolved anymore you know all right that was a good point but brother random made a statement that was so outstanding i thought how in the world could that man with no education say that he said you say well that was you know they evoluted he said well let's just take another word he said you got a mule he said now mew said he can't reproduce himself now did it click a mule can't reproduce where are you going to put him in the evolution theory you see how smart that man seventh grade education standing there making a state but i thought god how could it just stupidity of mankind to not understand that if you've got a mule something ended right because he can't reproduce himself he said now why i've used it why have you people you're you're a scientist why haven't you thought of that i said that i thought god you could put into the mind of a little old man a scientific fact you understand what i just said a scientific fact that the mule can't be reproduced well then how could it be evolving who did he evolve from and where did he evolve to go to the next state oh god amen just help us lord amen now look what i'm talking about then this being that we talk about coming into being back before the foundational world before there was anything but yet it was god all right go ahead to number two while we're tied these two together because we're on stage one now stage one is before the foundational world see i didn't even catch that when i preached that sermon i caught it sitting in the office a minute ago i thought god how stupid i am there's the answer listen now if god created man in his own image and in his own likeness what kind of a man did he create how many times have you heard that and what did he create a spirit man why did he create a spirit man because god is a spirit father spirit before the world he was father spirit he was spirit he was already father son and holy ghost he didn't have to become these things he brought them into manifestation in life but listen now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asks the question you'll find this that god gave dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but it is making up he made man in his own image to lead the cattle now how is he going to lead the cattle by the holy spirit not by his natural leading right leading the beast of the field just like the holy spirit leads the believer today right he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creation of god why did he bring it in the lower creation because an easier way to say the first man that was created human is the lower creation amen are you with me adam was a human being but he first made him a spirit being because that would be the same where the father would be all right that's right right but then he would come into natural the first creation was god himself oh but i don't understand that how could god create god god didn't create god god is the creator of all things he is that god see this is still before the foundational world he said wait a minute adam the first man in the lower creation you put him in flesh he's fine but you got him in spirit first right he's a spirit before he's in flesh come on why because he's in the image of god the first creation was god himself whatever god was adam was and we're not talking physical right remember it's before it's what i said i didn't catch that to how to to bring it i knew the stages the three stages but remember this stage stays totally before the foundation of the world or before time began our things begin etc then the next is a body starts coming into being see that's all right then but look the first creation was god himself then out of god came the logos still before the world which was the son of god still before the world then out of the logos which was the word for the foundational world in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth the man the creator the son of god you remember and i asked the question years ago i said you're talking about son of man but who knows when the son of god come into being you realize the son of god had come into being before the world ever become into being because he's the one that created it according to the bible it says all things were made by him and without him there was not anything made that was made who jesus christ the word not the flesh man that comes stage two we're still in stage one but back before the foundation of the world right adam the first man in the lower creation of god spirit man the first creation was god himself spirit man not spirit man coming into but he began to come into being he began to make himself manifest that's why it calls him the new creation because that's what he is okay come on follow me now go ahead to number three and notice then after a while i began to see a little sacred light begin to form like a little halo or something you you could see only see it by spiritual eye spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking the whole church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what god's doing and we'll get right down to this question here and you'll see how that he brings it in now no one has seen god no problem because god's a spirit you can't see a spirit and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there that's god coming into manifestation that's the logos the word the son of god all things that's god manifesting himself in a way that you can comprehend him amen we see a little white light forming what is that that was called by bible readers logos or the anointed or the anointing or as i was going to say the the part of god began to develop now listen into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was wonderful wording seventh grade education right began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was that's right was a little little light moving he that was the word of god now god gave himself birth to his son no problem which was before there was even the adam in the or the air to make an atom that was see jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back in yonder what did he do god gave himself birth to his son the word the word come into being not come into being because it was not into being but it come into manifestation or to place the word it could be comprehended god has been unveiling himself down through time to try to get you and me to be able to see him as i said the other day when i was talking about it i was glad that god didn't send a theologian to that dream i'm glad of that i'm glad he didn't send that we all have problems trying to understand you say we have problems trying to understand we may do it but we're not having problems as much as you would if you messed it up with a theologian and put him in there i'm not against theologies or nothing i'm just telling you the truth all right let's see if i can keep this there all right let's just keep it on one thought now no problems preaching i can preach for 10 years off i mean if that's what i said if you want to if you want to go back here if you want to thumb down to listen there's probably about 2 000 tape boxes sitting down there in the bottom take that and listen to see if that's what i was preaching 40 years ago no problems no bragging just telling the truth if not somebody come and show me where i changed it you've got the tapes downstairs welcome to them take them and listen to them and see if there's any difference in what i was preaching then and what i'm preaching now i ain't talking about depth now because it keeps unveiling just like i said i was sitting in there a while ago and the lord just cleared that up and brought it out three stages stage one was before the foundation of the world god came into being adam listen down you're gonna swallow hard adam's spiritual man was created before the world ever begun spiritual man of adam our spirit was brought into being before the world ever begun there's your genesis 1 26 and 27. first you let us make man in our own image let him have dominion it was not the natural atom to have dominion we don't need dominion over animals we need to be is just what we are right what are you following me now god gave himself birth to his son before the world ever begun but that's not a person coming into being that's a dividing or a multiplying of that person that was into being that was in the beginning before the world ever begun be real careful just don't cross yourself on your predestination just keep your predestination running straight that god by foreknowledge for new yeah but he foreign knew what you'd do he foreknew what he was going to do he was going to make adam as a spiritual man then one day he would make adam as a natural man oh he knew that he would come into being as a spiritual being father be the father that could not be seen nor comprehended but he would have to condescend and if he would then he would condescend into the word form and then it's so marvelous that word form would be the son the son would be the one that created all things come on not the flesh man the flesh man the lord jesus is stage two we have to get into that and back up stage one we're standing back before the foundation of the world and seeing that the father already had brought into being in his mind what he was going to do now you got your predestination running correct that he predestinates by his foreknowledge he knew what would happen when he made this man adam but he made him a spiritual man first now let me tell you let me say it this way to you according to blasphemous 9 brother brown said that adam's soul was eternal all right now you can read all you want to according to that you can go back to god's questions and answers on genesis the tapes that the prophet put out on that and listen to that and you'll hear it all over and over and over as it comes forth into a manifestation of understanding that god before the world knew ever move ever thought every idea that you and i would ever have and he knew what he was going to do he knew he was going to bring adam and eve into the garden in a physical being one day and that they would sin and he would have to do other things but he never killed him this is what i love he said he never even cursed adam or eve the one he cursed the serpent the land the things but he never cursed adam now that's understandable because adam's the son of god but he never cursed eve see why because eve brother branham said was in god in theophany so if if adam's soul was eternal it was in adam's theophany if adam's soul was eternal then the soul of eve would have to be eternal then the plan of redemption would enter the picture sure that he would have to go on and create and bring into bodies and things like that yes but think about back before the world that he knew all of that was going to take place before it ever even took place forever even thought started god by his own foreknowledge he did predest tonight in other words he had the plan and purpose before the world ever was thought of the plan and purpose of almighty god was brought into view even before the world was ever thought of you agree with me see what a wonderful thing to think about that would put us into the spiritual being form and then the spiritual being of form stage one is right in the basis that it's before the world ever begun that it would all come into manifestation and if he was ever there you'll be there if you weren't there you never will be there nor what who the spirit man the one that he said let us make man in our own image and what kind of a man did he make the prophet said said he made a spirit man well now if he made a spirit man you know for certain that he knew he was going to fall he had to allow mankind to come we'll get to that on the next stage but he knew what he was going to do he didn't create a son when you talk about the son of god you talk about the word the logos the things the theophanies and the things he didn't create a son he was that son just brought into manifestation why because jesus went over no man has seen the father but the son has to clarity right the son that declared him in other words he brought him out in the open that we can understand him because we couldn't understand him in spirit being but when it comes to the point of of knowing that there was more to the story he would make a way he would make a way to where that he could bring man into being sure see then adam came into being as a spirit man first right that's right you come in as a spirit man first with eternal life he said wait a minute no no come on you're not getting it right you're not listening to the story you're trying to free run me and just figuring it out don't do that just back up and walk with us a little bit because you see he had to make a man before there could be a fall right and he had to make him not eternal if he made him remember that anything you get that god makes with our word make our word new our word thoughts anything you get that makes god to want to the point that he's having problems under you know to bring into the open his plan and purpose see then you you're trying to figure him out don't try to figure him out just accept what he says hey come on folks maybe you've never done it but i will remember i can stand here today and remember back in those old baptist days sitting there in them pews now some of them preachers could preach you know pretty good and they could preach enough till i i caught on to a few things and me and my brother we'd get into the discussion because he was a theologian he got about 12 years of college we get into discussion and he's shrewd i'm talking about not just he's shrewd he's still smart as attack yet i told him one day i said from now on we're going to talk about the word we ain't going to talk about your ideas or your opinions or your thoughts remind either one you quote a scripture i'll quote a scripture because if you don't we're going to quit talking we quit talking why because he was natural how could you ever try to explain to him that adam was god's first creation he'd go right to the garden put him standing there you can't do that you got to put adam in glory because that's where he was at jesus was there and said remember the glory that we had see one of these days we're going to find out that there's a lot to do and more than we think but just remember jesus was not created of god to where that god could come into being he wasn't created he was that god he just moved from one form to another that's all that i've ever tried to explain of the godhead that you just take all that god was pour it into christ now take all the christ and pour him into the church then you'll find out what the new creation is then you'll find out where the prophet when he gets over there and he said this is a special designation of himself said this is talking about his church he gets all the way over and this tells us how beautiful the bride of jesus christ is listen just for a minute do you understand then stage one the beginning of the creation of god so you read it in revelations it's the message to this age so then the message to this age would be that message of the beginning of the creation of god or in other words the capability would be in this age to comprehend how god could come into being and manifest himself and not change his form or to be a son over here and a father here no he was just all of that put together in one thing there's just one person there's just one god yeah but i i don't understand because jesus looked like he was god jesus was the man that god dwelt in the flesh man there's a flesh man involved in this that god would come down in human flesh and that's why it says it in him was the word and the word was with god and the word was god think on it god is not a creation there's not somebody creating the other one it's stepping in see the pride is when we get to that we're going to really hold it right because when you get to the bride see you're going to find out all god was he poured into christ all christ into the church take her back to the garden of eden i'm going to find out that a part of you brother duret a part of you was back there before the world but the prophet said if not then it never will be but it wasn't back there like we want to think like peoples and ideas and principles and things right there wasn't but one man let's see if we can get this right and then we'll quit but just remember what i tried to bring about to you when you're talking about creating see we think about a wood tree growed made wood made of tree we cut that down we made done it made paper uh we made all kinds of things out of this tree that used to be in the ground but see god made it all by his word the only time that they were allowed to show of scene at the passion play because we found out later it was copyrighted and they only were allowed to use it one time and in that many of you have been to the passion plays and the things and know what i'm talking about that they act out the parts they act out to play they do the things you know and and all like that and then this one thing they would always make some form of a cloud floating around and bloom bloom and a world coming into being known if one this scene just opened up understood a man i thought it's a little different what they've been doing they're stood a man he stood there for a little bit and all at once he said let there be the world started coming into being you know now that how they act out the parts and the things they've done the sound and the smoke and the things and and all and he'd say let there be let there be and all at once it stopped and he stopped and he stood still i'm talking about a man in full dress everything you know what i'm saying and he said i mean it didn't say anything but all at once something happened and it just like he you know how they could they'd wound up making the rocks where they'd fold over each other and do the things you know where they could do and he just stepped through them rocks out of the way it closed back behind him and a baby cried a baby cried they started that play with jesus christ as a baby the only time that i ever seen him do it they'd start him as a man or this that the other they started him as a baby i sat there and cried because that was what happened the same one that created the world the same one who created all things one day stepped down into human flesh as a child grew as a child but i love the prophet the way he says things he said you're god with no teeth you think that little baby laying up there in that manger was the very god that had said let there be i thought well we did we checked into it we found out that they said it was copyrighted they couldn't view it no more like that because of the way they had it copyrighted and i thought ever who taught that they were they knew what they were talking about because you go from the very man that was the creator of all things almighty god the next step was a baby laying in a manger let's stand together what we got brother 205 hear the cross don't forget this little bracelet thing up here if it belongs any of you [Music] he [Music] in [Music] be my [Music] beginning to unveil itself a

billfold and my bible and i could only find three well one on a pretty good size i said it ain't the size it's what it's all about so i just took scissors and just cut that and made four of them

difference and don't worry about washing it you know people have said well well i washed my prayer cloth don't worry about you can't wash off the anointing can't be done you worship it all you want to
