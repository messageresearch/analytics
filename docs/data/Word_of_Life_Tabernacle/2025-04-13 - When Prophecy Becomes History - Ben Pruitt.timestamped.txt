[26:32] I love
[26:40] [Music]
[26:49] Lord, you love him. This morning, just I
[26:52] thrilled to announce something. We're
[26:54] taking up the offering. Uh, next next
[26:56] Sunday will be our Easter service. We
[26:58] will just have one service there Sunday
[27:00] morning. So, just be remember that. Next
[27:03] Sunday will be one service.
[27:06] be the Easter morning service there on
[27:08] Sunday. And let's sing that song if we
[27:10] could. I pledge allegiance to the lamb
[27:13] in
[27:14] KV. We're going to go for it
[27:18] again. I have
[27:24] heard
[27:25] ago they were brought before.
[27:34] They were told that he would spare their
[27:40] lives if they would
[27:43] reounce the name of
[27:47] Christ. But one by
[27:51] one they chose to
[27:56] die of God.
[27:59] They would not
[28:01] deny like a great
[28:05] angelic
[28:07] choir sings. I can almost hear their
[28:16] voice. I
[28:18] pledge
[28:20] alce to the
[28:23] lamb with all my strength. With all I
[28:30] am, I will seek to
[28:34] honor his
[28:37] command. I
[28:39] pledge
[28:41] alce
[28:44] to the
[28:47] lamb. Now the years have
[28:51] come and the years have
[28:55] gone, but the cause of
[28:59] Jesus still goes on. And now our time
[29:04] has come to count the cost to
[29:11] reject this world to
[29:14] embrace the cross.
[29:17] So one by one let us live our
[29:23] lives for the one who
[29:27] died to give us
[29:30] life till the
[29:32] trumpet sounds on that
[29:35] final day. Let us proudly stand and
[29:43] boldly say
[29:46] I
[29:48] alce to the
[29:51] lamb with all my strength with all I am.
[29:59] I will seek to
[30:02] honor his command.
[30:06] I
[30:07] pledge
[30:09] alce. Let's lift our hands. We sing that
[30:11] chorus again. The
[30:15] lamb. Oh, I
[30:17] pledge
[30:20] alce to the lamb.
[30:24] With all my strength, with all I am, I
[30:30] will seek to
[30:33] honor his
[30:37] command. I
[30:38] pledge
[30:40] alce
[30:44] to the
[30:49] lamb, man. Same key. I'm amazed. We'll
[30:51] do that chorus.
[30:53] [Music]
[31:02] [Music]
[31:03] that you
[31:05] care. It was through your
[31:08] preious
[31:13] blood and
[31:16] [Music]
[31:18] my washed away. All my sins are washed
[31:25] away. First
[31:27] verse. No one
[31:29] knew how alone I was
[31:34] feeling. And the emptiness I tried so
[31:39] hard to
[31:40] [Music]
[31:42] hide. I laughed and said my life was
[31:46] fine without
[31:49] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[31:54] I
[31:56] cried. Then one day someone told me of
[32:01] your
[32:04] mercies and the love you showed on a
[32:11] hillary. There
[32:13] you purchased my
[32:18] redemption. when you broke sin's power
[32:21] and set my spirit
[32:24] free. Oh, I'm
[32:28] amazed that you love
[32:32] me and I'm
[32:35] amazed that you
[32:38] care. It was through your
[32:41] preious blood I
[32:44] [Music]
[32:46] found and my s
[32:49] are washed. They're
[32:53] alled. All my sins are washed
[33:00] away. Yes, it's true. There have been
[33:04] days when I failed
[33:07] you. Lord, you know the times I've gone
[33:15] astray. But I've learned your love is
[33:18] stronger than my
[33:22] weakness and your ear.
[33:30] No one else has ever cared for me like
[33:34] you,
[33:36] Lord. Other friends could never be as
[33:40] close to
[33:43] me. I'm not afraid to face the problems
[33:48] [Music]
[33:50] of knowing you
[33:53] are I'll ever
[34:00] [Music]
[34:02] that you love
[34:04] me. I'm so
[34:08] amazed that you
[34:11] care. It was through your
[34:13] preious blood I
[34:22] founded. They're all washed away. All my
[34:27] sins are washed
[34:32] away. Amen. Are you thankful for his
[34:36] love and mercy this morning? Let's sing
[34:38] that song. I just want to please the
[34:39] Lord. We'll sing this one and we'll sing
[34:41] one more and invite our pastor to come

[34:45] from the word of the Lord and let's sing

[35:48] to him again?

[37:20] desires this morning just to please him.

[39:43] believe in your presence anything is
[39:45] possible.

[42:17] through verse
[42:19] 10. So good to be in the house of the
[42:21] Lord this morning. Good to see several
[42:24] of you back with us that haven't been
[42:25] here in a few weeks. God bless you. I
[42:27] know the weather's been crazy. Things
[42:30] have just been turned upside down, it
[42:32] seems like. But but it's bright outside
[42:34] today. It's sunny. Brother Joel's in
[42:37] Ohio. He had a family wedding this
[42:39] weekend. So he's up there be attending
[42:42] brother Lawson's church this morning.
[42:45] praying for him on the roads coming back
[42:47] today. And each one of you that are
[42:48] here, thank you for being here today. We
[42:50] got food coming up after the service.
[42:53] Maybe I shouldn't mention that right
[42:54] before I preach, but but uh I want you
[42:58] all to be hungry, but we'll try not to
[42:59] hold you too awful long. Brother Josh
[43:01] Kathy, didn't he do a wonderful job
[43:03] Wednesday night? Wasn't that
[43:07] wonderful? So good to have you and
[43:09] Sister Kaden and the children with us
[43:11] this week. And they'll be headed back to
[43:13] Tucson. praying for them. They fly out
[43:15] tonight, this evening. Good to have uh
[43:18] Jaden and Isabella with us today. God
[43:21] bless you. Thank you for coming and good
[43:23] to have each and every one of you. We
[43:24] just love you and uh pray the Lord
[43:27] blessings will be on us today as we
[43:29] worship together. Matthew
[43:32] 21:6 says, "And the disciples went and
[43:36] did as Jesus commanded them and brought
[43:40] the ass and the colt, put on them their
[43:42] clothes, and they them there on very
[43:45] great multitudes spread their garments
[43:47] in the way. Others cut down branches
[43:50] from the trees and straw them in the
[43:52] way. The multitudes that went before and
[43:54] that followed cried saying, "Hosana to
[43:58] the son of David. Blessed is he that
[44:02] cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana
[44:05] in the highest." When he was coming to
[44:08] Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
[44:11] saying, "Who is this?" Pray the Lord
[44:14] would add his blessing to the word. You
[44:17] may be seated. I want to speak to you
[44:19] this morning on prophecy becoming
[44:22] history. Prophecy becoming history.
[44:26] Prophecy. A prophecy is a foretelling or
[44:29] a prediction, a declaration of something
[44:32] to come. It's something that God only
[44:35] knows. And so if it's a true prophecy,
[44:38] it's can only be God or some person
[44:41] informed by him that can utter a real
[44:44] prophecy. We know that this book is a
[44:46] book of prophecy. It's a book of
[44:48] prophecy and it's a book of history.
[44:51] It's a book of of things prophesied and
[44:54] things coming to pass. So history is
[44:57] from the word story. It just means
[44:59] something that happened and is told. And
[45:02] so the Bible tells us when especially in
[45:05] the Old Testament of prophecy and the
[45:07] New Testament of the fulfillment of
[45:09] prophecy. Yet we know that there are
[45:11] prophecy specific to the day that we
[45:13] live in today. Peter tells the people
[45:16] that early church in second Peter
[45:17] chapter 1, he said, "We also have a more
[45:21] sure word of prophecy, where to you do
[45:24] well that you take heed as unto a light
[45:27] that shineth in a dark place until the
[45:30] day dawn and the day star arise in your
[45:33] hearts." Knowing this first, no prophecy
[45:36] of the scripture is of any private
[45:39] interpretation. For the prophecy came
[45:41] not in old time by the will of man, but
[45:46] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[45:50] by the Holy Ghost. And so we find that
[45:53] the prophet Zachchariah was moved by the
[45:56] Holy Spirit one day and he spoke nearly
[46:00] uh nearly uh maybe hundreds of years
[46:04] before Jesus rode out on a donkey and
[46:07] come out down the mountain and and the
[46:10] people rejoiced. And he said in
[46:11] Zechariah 9:9, "Rejoice greatly, O
[46:15] daughter of Zion. Shout, oh daughter of
[46:18] Jerusalem." Now, there was a reason for
[46:20] their rejoicing. He's not telling them
[46:23] to shout because the music is loud. He's
[46:26] not telling them to shout because things
[46:28] are are good or they have money or or
[46:31] things are or everything's going just
[46:34] the way they want it to go. That's not
[46:35] why he's telling them to shout. But he
[46:37] said, "I want you to shout because
[46:39] prophecy is going to become history." He
[46:42] said, "Shout because your king is
[46:44] coming." That's the reason we ought to
[46:46] shout today. Not just because somebody
[46:48] us up into a shout, but because our king
[46:51] is coming. Amen. And our king has come
[46:54] in word form in this day. Now, he's
[46:57] coming unto you. He is just and having
[46:59] salvation lowly and riding upon an ass
[47:02] and upon a cult the full of an ass. Not
[47:05] only Zechariah, but 4,000 years of
[47:08] prophecy spoke of that moment when he
[47:10] would come into Jerusalem to be what he
[47:13] was called to be, to do what he was
[47:15] chosen to do. is he was the only one who
[47:18] was worthy to do that. He's he's
[47:20] literally the only one who had a right
[47:22] to do it. The only one who was worthy to
[47:24] do it. They searched all through heaven
[47:26] and said, "Who is worthy to take the
[47:28] book and open his one was worthy?"
[47:30] Because only one was worthy to die for
[47:32] our sins. We couldn't die for our own
[47:35] sins because then we would be dead. But
[47:38] he died not being a sinner. And so he
[47:40] was raised from the dead on the third
[47:43] day. I'm so thankful for that today.
[47:46] So the the people were buzzing with
[47:50] anticipation because they believed that
[47:52] some Easter weekend as we would call it
[47:55] or Passover weekend. They believed that
[47:59] that there was their Messiah was going
[48:01] to come and they read their children.
[48:04] Zechariah 9:9 says, "Rejoice greatly,
[48:07] and when you see your king coming to
[48:10] you, riding on a donkey coming down the
[48:13] mountain." When he comes into Jerusalem,
[48:16] remember that's a time to rejoice. When
[48:20] you see him coming, many of them have
[48:22] spent their entire lives studying
[48:23] promises of a Messiah. They said,
[48:25] "There's a Messiah coming. There's one
[48:27] coming who uh who's going to write all
[48:30] the wrongs. He's going to make the
[48:31] crooked places straight and things are
[48:33] going to be different when he comes and
[48:35] and we we'll we'll shake off this Roman
[48:37] system. And they didn't realize the
[48:39] impact that he would make and and they
[48:41] didn't realize that it wasn't going to
[48:43] be a political move, but it was going to
[48:45] be a spiritual move. They were looking
[48:47] for politics. I think some people still
[48:49] today are looking for for a political
[48:51] move, looking for the salvation in
[48:54] politics. But the bride's salvation will
[48:56] never be in politics. It'll never be in
[48:58] government. It'll only be in Jesus
[49:00] Christ.
[49:02] But they were buzzing with
[49:05] anticipation, waiting. The whole city
[49:07] was moved
[49:09] as they waited on him to
[49:12] come. They prayed every day and sang
[49:16] psalms at the temple speaking of his
[49:18] coming. Lord,
[49:20] come and and and and make things right.
[49:25] Change our world.
[49:28] And brother Brandon picks it up and he
[49:30] says, "Here are those people that read
[49:32] that scripture day by day. Watched him
[49:35] come riding in and cried, "Who is
[49:41] this?" They watched him come in exactly
[49:44] like he said he would. Yet the people
[49:47] who were the most read up on it, the the
[49:50] the most accurate theologians of the day
[49:54] were unable to see what happened when it
[49:57] happened. Prophecy becoming
[50:01] history. They had they had seen the
[50:03] miracles. They knew he was a prophet.
[50:06] They saw him as he come and healed the
[50:09] sick, as he healed the blind man and
[50:11] healed the leper.
[50:13] You know, that's how we know he can heal
[50:14] today is because we know what he did
[50:16] when he was in the flesh. We know what
[50:18] he did when he was here on earth. And
[50:19] so, we know he's still a healer today
[50:22] because he's Jesus Christ the same
[50:23] yesterday, today, and forever. And so,
[50:26] we know he can heal. We know he can
[50:27] save. We know he can straighten out a
[50:29] home. We Come on, church. We know that
[50:31] because that's what he did and that's
[50:33] what he's doing now. We know it, Brother
[50:35] West, because he's still doing it in our
[50:37] lives.
[50:38] We have personal experience. I wonder
[50:40] how many can testify today. He still
[50:42] does miracles. He still heals the sick.
[50:45] He still raises the dead.
[50:50] They they had experienced his presence.
[50:54] Were moved by his power, saw the lepers
[50:57] cleansed and the blind were able to see
[51:00] and and the lame
[51:02] walk. Yet they said, "Who is this?"
[51:07] Matthew 21:10, when he was coming to
[51:09] Jerusalem, all the city was
[51:12] moved. Who is
[51:14] this? Notice how ridiculous. Brother
[51:17] Brandon says that the word of God to a
[51:19] people who is supposed to believe
[51:23] it. And yet, it's so unusual. I want you
[51:27] to notice this and because I want you to
[51:29] think deeply today and ponder on what
[51:31] we're going to say because I think it's
[51:33] important that we understand the
[51:35] prophecy that's become history in our
[51:37] day and realize that prophecy can still
[51:39] become history in our own
[51:42] lives. So he said it's so unusual that
[51:45] they cry out well what's this? Where did
[51:49] you get that stuff? Who is this? What is
[51:52] this? when they ought to have been
[51:55] screaming, "Hosana to the king that
[51:58] cometh in the name of the Lord." But
[52:01] there was just a little group doing
[52:04] that. Just a little group. So the
[52:07] multitude said, "Who is this?" Now we
[52:10] know that the attraction on the mountain
[52:12] that day was prophecy becoming history.
[52:16] God
[52:17] fulfilling his word. Now, brother
[52:19] Brandon ties that. He goes through, if
[52:21] you listen to the the sermon, what is
[52:22] the attraction on the mountain? He goes
[52:24] through uh he goes through Noah and and
[52:28] he ties it to that and and some other
[52:30] things. And then he ties it to uh the
[52:32] day of Pentecost. And he says another
[52:35] attraction was on a mount was on the day
[52:37] of Pentecost. It was on the temple mount
[52:39] when all of them was up there in a
[52:41] religious feast. He said thought they
[52:43] had got rid of all the fanatics. They
[52:45] hadn't heard from them for 10 days. All
[52:48] of a sudden, like a beehive, he said
[52:50] they broke out of the top of the
[52:52] building out into the streets of
[52:54] screaming and carrying on. What is this?
[52:58] What meanth this? They said, "Are these
[53:01] are all these men
[53:03] drunk?" But see, what was happening was
[53:06] God was fulfilling his word, prophecy
[53:09] becoming history. And I know this is
[53:11] elementary, but I'm building up to
[53:13] something this morning. Joel had
[53:14] promised them what would happen, but
[53:16] they didn't see it. We find in in Acts
[53:19] 21:14, Peter stood up and lifted up his
[53:22] voice and said to them, "Ye men of Judea
[53:23] and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be
[53:25] that known as you, hearken to my words.
[53:27] These are not drunken as you suppose,
[53:29] seeing it as but the third hour of the
[53:31] day." Well, maybe I should just stop
[53:34] there for just a moment. We won't stop
[53:35] for long, but I can stop there just for
[53:37] a moment. When's the last time somebody
[53:39] accused your church of being drunk or
[53:41] accused you personally of being drunk in
[53:46] church? I think we need to feel the
[53:49] presence of God. Sometimes we need to
[53:50] recognize that what it was was
[53:52] stimulation of revelation. They weren't
[53:54] drunk on a preacher. They weren't drunk
[53:56] on a personality. They weren't drunk on
[53:58] on what some man said or somebody
[54:00] working them up into a frenzy. They were
[54:02] drunk on the fulfillment of the word of
[54:04] God. God, you promised it and today it's
[54:07] being fulfilled. Oh, I think every one
[54:09] of us ought to get drunk on the
[54:10] fulfillment of the promises today. I
[54:12] challenge you to believe the promises of
[54:14] the word. If you can believe them, he'll
[54:16] bring them to pass in your life. If
[54:18] you're a young family who's struggling,
[54:20] and you believe the promise of the word
[54:22] that says, "I have not seen the
[54:23] righteous forsaken or his seed begging
[54:26] bread." You ought to be able to believe
[54:27] that with all of your heart and stand
[54:29] with that and and see it come to pass in
[54:31] your life. And there ought to be a
[54:33] stimulation, a revelation when you see
[54:35] God begin to move. When he gives you
[54:37] that baby that you shouldn't have. When
[54:38] he gives you, come on, church. When he
[54:40] when he gives you the things that you
[54:42] shouldn't have. When your children come
[54:43] home. When they had no business, seem
[54:45] like they were lost for good and they
[54:47] begin to come back to the house of the
[54:48] Lord. What is that prophecy becoming
[54:51] history? And it ought to make us drunk
[54:52] on the presence of God and what God has
[54:55] done in our day.
[54:57] We ought to get excited, get out of
[54:58] ourselves sometimes and get excited
[55:00] about what God is doing in this hour.
[55:02] Listen, I don't believe that we have to
[55:04] take a a look back in history and say,
[55:06] "Well, the way it used to be, the way it
[55:08] used to be." I believe today is the
[55:10] premier day for the bride. I believe
[55:12] right now is the moment we can receive
[55:14] what God has given us.
[55:18] We don't have to take a backseat to any
[55:20] other age.
[55:21] But here in the age of darkness of
[55:23] Leona, there is a bride without spot or
[55:26] wrinkle. When everything is spotted,
[55:28] when every table is full of vomit, there
[55:30] is a people offering a pure sacrifice to
[55:32] God.
[55:43] Too fat.
[55:47] This
[55:48] is so these people aren't
[55:50] drunk. This is
[55:53] sad. Are you hearing me? This is
[55:56] sad. Oh, I want to tell you today this
[55:59] is
[56:00] that if you could just drink of it. If
[56:03] you just partake of it, this is that.
[56:06] And we think we can find our answers all
[56:08] in the world and things. And I know
[56:10] there's things people can do to help.
[56:11] And I love that people help other
[56:12] people. I love that. But the answer for
[56:15] us as the bride is him and he is the
[56:18] word. If we can just realize this
[56:20] message has the answer to every question
[56:22] that we have. It was given to us that
[56:24] it's Christ revealed to us in our day.
[56:27] We just drink of it and commit ourselves
[56:29] to it and surrender ourselves to him.
[56:33] Things could be different. This is that
[56:37] Peter goes on to preach to them and
[56:38] said, "This same Jesus that you
[56:39] crucified has now become Lord and
[56:41] Savior." And when they heard this, they
[56:43] were
[56:44] pricricked in their
[56:46] heart. Oh, that's what we need today. If
[56:49] you've got any movement, if there's any
[56:51] desire in your heart, when you hear the
[56:53] word of the Lord preached and there's
[56:54] any kind of any kind of a prick there at
[56:56] all, you say, "Oh, I need to be saved. I
[56:58] need to be right." Why don't you give
[57:00] into that, surrender to that? It may not
[57:02] be there forever. He don't have to deal
[57:03] with men forever, but if you feel free,
[57:05] listen to me, young people. If you feel
[57:07] him pricking at your heart, that's the
[57:08] time to reach out to him and say, "Lord,
[57:10] I want everything you have for me. I
[57:12] need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I
[57:15] need your presence in my life."
[57:19] They were pricricked in their heart and
[57:20] said to Peter and the rest of the
[57:21] apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall
[57:24] we do?" And Peter, Brother Brandham
[57:27] calls him Dr. Peter gave the
[57:29] prescription said unto them, "Repent and
[57:31] be baptized every one of you in the name
[57:32] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[57:34] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[57:37] the Holy Ghost." We make it too
[57:38] complicated, church. I remember Sister
[57:40] Stephanie, it was it been three years
[57:42] ago now that you come on an Easter and
[57:44] heard the word and the next week they
[57:46] were baptized. Her and Trip were
[57:47] baptized and and I believe they received
[57:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God
[57:51] changed their life. It's that simple,
[57:53] church. Brother Ryan, you were baptized.
[57:55] I believe the Holy Ghost can fill your
[57:57] life and make you new. I believe he's
[57:59] still the same yesterday, today, and
[58:00] forever. I believe he keeps his word
[58:03] today. Hallelujah. Do you believe he
[58:05] keeps his word? You believe he's the
[58:07] same today as he ever was. Oh, I think
[58:09] we ought to testify to our neighbors and
[58:11] tell them what God's done in this day. I
[58:13] think we ought to testify to our
[58:14] children and tell them what God's done
[58:16] in this day. This is not something to
[58:18] hide in a corner. This is that was
[58:21] spoken of. This is prophecy becoming
[58:23] history. He said there would be a bride
[58:25] and there is a bride.
[58:28] Hallelujah.
[58:29] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[58:35] Brandon calls this the eternal
[58:37] prescription. He said, "I know they got
[58:38] a substitute today being born again.
[58:39] Just shake hands with the preacher and
[58:42] put your name on the book." But friends,
[58:43] that is a dogma. It's not a Bible truth.
[58:48] If it would, the Acts of the Apostles in
[58:49] the second chapter would have read like
[58:50] this. When the day of Pentecost was
[58:53] fully come, the pastor walked out and
[58:54] shook hands with the people. I heard
[58:56] that preached in a message church. The
[58:59] day of Pentecost was like going out and
[59:01] just shaking hands on the parking lot.
[59:03] Everybody's smiling at each
[59:05] other. I smile a lot. I've never No
[59:08] one's ever called me
[59:10] drunk. But brother Ram said it wasn't
[59:13] that. The pastor didn't walk out and
[59:14] shook shook hands with the people.
[59:16] That's not what it was. wasn't just a
[59:18] good day at church, but it was the
[59:20] fulfillment of prophecy. Prophecy became
[59:23] history, and they were they were
[59:24] inspired by it. Something in them had to
[59:26] cry out to him. They couldn't even speak
[59:29] in their own language.
[59:32] Oh my.
[59:34] Hallelujah. Pastor walk out, shake hands
[59:36] with the people, but said, "When the day
[59:38] of Pentecost fully come, the
[59:39] inauguration of the church, there came a
[59:41] sound from heaven like a rushing mighty
[59:43] wind that filled all the house where
[59:45] they were sitting."
[59:47] That's how the Holy Spirit come the
[59:48] first time. He said that's how it comes
[59:50] every time. Someone say it with me.
[59:52] Every time. That's how it comes every
[59:55] time since that time.
[59:58] Hallelujah. He is God and changes not.
[1:00:02] He said now it stumbles people. They say
[1:00:04] that was for another day. Well, he's the
[1:00:05] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:00:08] Every time the church ever received the
[1:00:10] Holy Ghost, it's always come like he did
[1:00:12] the first time under the same
[1:00:14] prescription. Acts 2:38, "It never has
[1:00:17] changed, never will change." He said,
[1:00:20] "And the doctor's prescription on how to
[1:00:22] receive the Holy Ghost is given to us by
[1:00:23] Dr. Simon Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[1:00:25] I'll give you a prescription. Repent,
[1:00:27] every one of you, and be baptized in the
[1:00:29] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:00:30] of sins, and you shall receive the gift
[1:00:32] of the Holy Ghost." For the prescription
[1:00:34] is to them that's far off. And even as
[1:00:36] many as the Lord our God shall call. I'm
[1:00:38] glad, brother. As long as he's still
[1:00:40] calling, it's still effective today.
[1:00:43] Yes, sir. Glad he's still
[1:00:45] calling. He said the eternal
[1:00:47] prescription.
[1:00:51] Hallelujah. So, what was it the day that
[1:00:53] you received the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:55] Ghost? What was that that did that,
[1:00:57] brother David? What is that, brother JT
[1:00:59] that did that? It's Oh, hallelujah. When
[1:01:02] you received the true baptism of the
[1:01:04] Holy Ghost, what it was was
[1:01:06] prophecy becoming history.
[1:01:09] He said, "I'll pour out my spirit on all
[1:01:11] flesh.
[1:01:12] You were one of the sons and daughters
[1:01:15] that could receive that and and bear
[1:01:17] fruit of that in your womb, a womb of
[1:01:19] your soul. And and because of that, it
[1:01:22] was prophecy becoming history. And it
[1:01:24] brings rejoicing in your
[1:01:27] life.
[1:01:29] Hallelujah.
[1:01:30] Now, I want to kind of turn a corner
[1:01:33] here as I want us to think personally
[1:01:36] and then think a little bit
[1:01:38] wider as we think about it. See the
[1:01:41] promise, any promise of the word is
[1:01:44] either
[1:01:46] prophecy or
[1:01:48] history at any given point in your life.
[1:01:53] Right? So I am the God that heals all
[1:01:56] thy
[1:01:57] diseases. It's either prophecy or
[1:02:01] history in your life. He said, "But I
[1:02:04] still have symptoms in my life." But it
[1:02:06] can become history when you believe it.
[1:02:10] Right? when you believe it. Because when
[1:02:12] you believe it, the promise is yours.
[1:02:13] Brother said, "It's like having
[1:02:15] a needing a loaf of bread because you're
[1:02:18] hungry and somebody gives you the money
[1:02:19] to buy a loaf of bread and you go out."
[1:02:21] He said, "You can be just as happy with
[1:02:23] the purchase price of it because you
[1:02:25] know you have what it takes to get a
[1:02:26] loaf of bread." And when you receive
[1:02:28] your healing, you have what it takes for
[1:02:30] them symptoms to leave. You've got what
[1:02:33] it takes. You don't need anything else.
[1:02:34] You can be happy with that,
[1:02:37] right? And you can go purchase it now.
[1:02:39] So, so it's either prophecy or
[1:02:42] history.
[1:02:44] Now, it can't be
[1:02:47] both. So, there's things that have not
[1:02:49] yet come to pass. There's things that
[1:02:52] are still prophecy. There are things
[1:02:54] that are history, but they can't be
[1:02:57] both. You either have the Holy Ghost or
[1:03:00] you
[1:03:01] don't. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:03] either a prophecy to you or history to
[1:03:05] you.
[1:03:08] That ought to make a Baptist shout.
[1:03:12] I'm so glad it's history. But if you
[1:03:15] don't have it yet, don't give up. It's
[1:03:16] yet it's a prophecy to you,
[1:03:20] right? It's prophecy becoming history.
[1:03:23] So the promise is either prophecy or
[1:03:25] history to you. You either have it or
[1:03:27] you don't. Brother Brandon tells us you
[1:03:29] must be identified somewhere. You must
[1:03:31] show your life shows tonight where you
[1:03:33] are identified. You are identified
[1:03:34] either in Christ or out of Christ.
[1:03:37] You are not halfway. There's no such
[1:03:39] thing as a drunk sober man. There's no
[1:03:42] black white bird. You're either saved or
[1:03:45] you're not saved. Somebody needs to get
[1:03:47] that revelation today. You need to make
[1:03:49] up in your mind whether it's prophecy or
[1:03:51] history. And if it's prophecy, you need
[1:03:53] to seek it. And if it's history, you
[1:03:55] need to believe it.
[1:03:59] Are you with me now? You need to stand
[1:04:01] and say, "I am saved." Because the
[1:04:02] devil's going to tell you you're not
[1:04:04] saved. The devil's going to tell you you
[1:04:05] didn't get it. The devil's going to tell
[1:04:07] you you're not good enough. That's his
[1:04:08] job is to tell you that. But you can
[1:04:10] stand up for the game and put put your
[1:04:11] state down and say, "I know it's history
[1:04:13] in my life. I know my life was changed.
[1:04:15] I know what I was and I know what I am
[1:04:17] today."
[1:04:19] Hallelujah.
[1:04:23] So he said, "You're either you're a
[1:04:25] saint or a sinner. One or the other.
[1:04:27] Your spiritual attitude I love this.
[1:04:30] What what what makes you what what what
[1:04:32] shows you what you are? Your spiritual
[1:04:35] attitude towards God's word
[1:04:38] identifies you
[1:04:40] exactly where you're standing. Oh, the
[1:04:43] way you're pulling this morning, I
[1:04:44] believe you're standing in a good place.
[1:04:50] Your spiritual attitude towards God's
[1:04:52] word identifies exactly where you're
[1:04:54] standing. God's word vindicated proved
[1:04:57] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:59] just the same as it ever was on the day
[1:05:02] of Pentecost or any other time.
[1:05:06] Hallelujah. I'm so glad that it is. He
[1:05:09] said uh he said and Jesus Christ is the
[1:05:11] same yesterday, today and forever. Your
[1:05:13] attitude towards that identifies whether
[1:05:16] you have spiritual amnesia or not.
[1:05:19] Right? He says whether or not you've
[1:05:21] forgotten who you are. Spiritual
[1:05:23] amnesia. Amnesia is when you forget who
[1:05:26] you are. He said, "That's right. No
[1:05:28] matter whether if you're a deacon or if
[1:05:31] you're a preacher, it doesn't make you
[1:05:34] Yeah, they get it, too." He said, "So,
[1:05:36] we find out it's contagious and it's the
[1:05:38] whole thing." Spiritual amnesia does.
[1:05:40] I'm so glad that you know. See, a
[1:05:42] spiritual amnesiac doesn't know that
[1:05:44] it's become history in his life. But you
[1:05:46] and I, our minds have been cleared today
[1:05:48] to know I'm not the son of John and
[1:05:51] Sharon Puit, but I'm the son of God. I'm
[1:05:53] a son of God. You're a daughter of God.
[1:06:02] I wonder if we've forgotten. Wonder if
[1:06:05] we forget sometimes who we are. Forget
[1:06:08] we're identified with this
[1:06:10] message. See, something happened to you.
[1:06:12] There's a reason why you hunger for the
[1:06:14] things of God. You can't be like other
[1:06:15] people. You might even try to be like
[1:06:18] other people, but God's going to get
[1:06:20] you.
[1:06:30] God's going to get you. He's got a way
[1:06:33] of doing it.
[1:06:36] Have we forgotten we're identified by
[1:06:39] with this message? And let me say
[1:06:40] something. We are not identified by a
[1:06:42] picture or belt buckle. Thank God. Can't
[1:06:46] get one of those that don't hurt
[1:06:49] me. That was my identification. But
[1:06:51] Josh, I'd be in
[1:06:53] trouble. Or a wheat pin or a cloud pin.
[1:06:57] Come on, church. I love those things.
[1:06:58] But that's not that's not our
[1:07:00] identification, but our identification.
[1:07:02] He told us what it was. It's our
[1:07:03] attitude towards the word.
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:10] It's not where we go to church or who
[1:07:11] our pastor is. tape we listen to or what
[1:07:14] it is that we do, but it's our attitude
[1:07:16] towards the word that makes us what we
[1:07:18] are.
[1:07:21] Hallelujah.
[1:07:22] Hallelujah. Zechariah 9, there was the
[1:07:26] prophecy of the first coming of Christ.
[1:07:27] In Zechariah 14, the same prophet spoke
[1:07:30] of his second coming. Do you realize
[1:07:32] that? Zechariah
[1:07:33] 14:4 says, "His feet shall stand in that
[1:07:36] day upon the Mount of Olives, which is
[1:07:39] before Jerusalem on the east. And the
[1:07:42] Mount of Olives shall cleave in the
[1:07:44] midst thereof toward the east and toward
[1:07:46] the west. And there shall be a very
[1:07:48] great valley." Brother Brandon said,
[1:07:50] "There'll be a great earthquake." He
[1:07:51] said that's the same earthquake in
[1:07:52] Revelation. He said, "There shall be a
[1:07:54] very great valley, and half of the
[1:07:56] mountain shall remove toward the north,
[1:07:58] and half of it toward the south, and you
[1:08:02] shall flee to the valley of the
[1:08:05] mountains. For the valley of the
[1:08:06] mountain shall reach unto us all. You
[1:08:08] shall flee like you fled from from the
[1:08:11] earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king
[1:08:12] of Judah, and the Lord thy God shall
[1:08:14] come and all the saints with thee." That
[1:08:18] blesses me every time I read it. It says
[1:08:21] his feet. Let me let me just say this.
[1:08:23] He said his feet will stand on the Mount
[1:08:25] of Olives. I don't I don't spiritualize
[1:08:27] that a bit. I believe his feet, Christ's
[1:08:31] feet will stand on the Mount of Olives.
[1:08:34] Amen. I I believe I'll see him, church.
[1:08:37] Brother Brandon said he'll he'll come,
[1:08:39] he said, in a literal corporal body. He
[1:08:41] said, and that's what believers believe.
[1:08:46] So, we believe that's coming. That's
[1:08:48] ahead for us. That's a prophecy.
[1:08:51] all the saints with thee. It's a
[1:08:52] prophecy. But here now, let's look at
[1:08:54] this in Zechariah 14:6. Something that
[1:08:56] was a prophecy. It shall come to pass in
[1:08:59] that day. That's the day of the of his
[1:09:02] the rapture age, if we could say it that
[1:09:04] way. The light shall be not not be clear
[1:09:06] nor dark, but it shall be one day which
[1:09:09] will be known to the Lord, not day nor
[1:09:11] night, but it shall come to pass at
[1:09:13] evening
[1:09:14] time it shall be light.
[1:09:18] Hallelujah.
[1:09:20] prophecy. And it shall be in that day
[1:09:22] that living waters shall go out from
[1:09:24] Jerusalem and have them toward the
[1:09:25] hindrance sea and summer and winter
[1:09:26] shall it be. Now, we know that scripture
[1:09:28] has compound meanings. I believe there's
[1:09:30] a there's a meaning of this for the uh
[1:09:33] millennium perhaps or the new heavens
[1:09:35] and the new earth. But here he's
[1:09:37] talking, brother Brandham said that that
[1:09:39] the gospel going forth to both Jew and
[1:09:41] Gentile. And in Zechariah 14:9 again he
[1:09:45] said the Lord should be king over all
[1:09:46] the earth. that day there shall be one
[1:09:48] Lord and his name one. Now, Brother
[1:09:51] Brham picks out that scripture of light
[1:09:53] at the evening time and identifies that
[1:09:55] as a prophecy which has now become
[1:09:59] history. Right? It shall be light when
[1:10:01] she grows beyond
[1:10:04] organization. I love that. Just ponder
[1:10:07] that for a moment. The bride has to
[1:10:09] reach a place of maturity, brother Paul.
[1:10:11] Beyond
[1:10:13] organization, beyond denomination. And
[1:10:15] anytime you see people take an
[1:10:17] organization or a denomination out of
[1:10:19] this message. We got to grow beyond that
[1:10:22] to fulfill this scripture. Right? When
[1:10:25] she grows beyond organization, when she
[1:10:27] gets out past organization, it blooms
[1:10:31] out again, she'll put forth oranges like
[1:10:34] she was when she went into the ground,
[1:10:36] and then it shall be light. So, it's
[1:10:37] like a tree that was planted, a citrus
[1:10:40] tree, and other types of fruit were
[1:10:42] grafted in, but it was an orange tree to
[1:10:45] begin with. Thank God for that because I
[1:10:47] don't like lemons. I like
[1:10:50] oranges. But it wasn't Hallelujah. He
[1:10:52] said it was an orange
[1:10:54] tree. It was an orange tree to begin
[1:10:57] with. Wasn't some old sour. Thank
[1:11:01] God. But it was an orange tree. I think
[1:11:04] some of y'all been on that lemon tree
[1:11:05] that grafted. Praise God. You been
[1:11:08] Somebody's been eating off the lemon
[1:11:09] tree. You know, get really
[1:11:12] sour. But it was an orange tree to begin
[1:11:14] with. and denomination come and graft it
[1:11:17] in other other branches living off the
[1:11:19] same life. Right? But the tree had to
[1:11:22] grow beyond that. And when the tree put
[1:11:25] forth another branch Oh, I hope you're
[1:11:27] hearing me, church. This was a prophecy.
[1:11:30] But you're looking at it.
[1:11:32] Where is the branch of the Lord today,
[1:11:34] minister? It's right here. I'm in.
[1:11:37] You're in. We are church. We are the
[1:11:39] fulfillment of the prophecy of Malachi
[1:11:42] 4. Behold, I send you Elijah the
[1:11:44] prophet. We are the ones he was sent for
[1:11:46] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:11:48] to the fathers. That's us. We've been
[1:11:51] turned back our heart. No wonder we can
[1:11:53] rejoice like no other. No wonder this is
[1:11:55] a king lamb worship time like no other
[1:11:57] because we know our hearts have been
[1:11:59] turned back by the message of the hour.
[1:12:03] Hallelujah. What was
[1:12:06] prophecy now becomes
[1:12:08] history. Now look, he said, "When it
[1:12:11] blooms out
[1:12:13] again, she'll put forth oranges like
[1:12:16] Hallelujah, like she was when she went
[1:12:18] into the ground, and then it shall be
[1:12:21] light." What's this attraction? What's
[1:12:23] this happening? Fulfilling God's
[1:12:26] word.
[1:12:29] Hallelujah. Now, I want to go somewhere
[1:12:31] in the rest of the sermon. I want you to
[1:12:33] stay with me because it's important.
[1:12:35] Something that happened in our day.
[1:12:37] Brother Brandham had a
[1:12:40] vision. He was picking a cocoa off of
[1:12:43] his pants and a blast came. He thought
[1:12:46] it might be his death. And he's telling
[1:12:49] this in a sermon called, "Is this a sign
[1:12:50] of the end? Sir, in December, the last
[1:12:53] day of December, the uh it's actually
[1:12:55] New Year's Eve and or the day before
[1:12:58] that in uh
[1:13:00] 1962. Is this the sign of the in sir?"
[1:13:02] He said, "I was at Tucson, Arizona in
[1:13:05] the vision, for it made it so purpose
[1:13:07] that he didn't want me to fail to see
[1:13:10] where it was at. I was picking a sandbur
[1:13:13] of me from the desert." He tells, he
[1:13:16] goes on to tell about the little birds
[1:13:18] that flew by. And those of you who have
[1:13:19] read this, you'll understand what I'm
[1:13:20] talking about. Little birds that flew
[1:13:22] by, a group of them. He said, "Then
[1:13:24] doves flying and they're flying from the
[1:13:26] west." I don't know where west is here,
[1:13:27] but they're flying from the west. I
[1:13:29] believe it's that way. west coming east,
[1:13:32] he said. And he he said, "No sooner had
[1:13:36] they gotten out of my sight, I turned
[1:13:37] again to look westward." So there's been
[1:13:39] little birds and then doves fly by. He
[1:13:42] said, "I turned again to look westward.
[1:13:43] There it happened. There was a blast
[1:13:44] that actually shook the whole earth. It
[1:13:46] shook the earth." He said, "It was like
[1:13:48] a sound barrier broken." There's a
[1:13:50] sermon in that. It's like the sound
[1:13:53] barrier broken or a thunderclap. He said
[1:13:55] like lightning and thunder. He said,
[1:13:57] "But it shook the earth." And when it
[1:13:58] did, I was still looking westward. And
[1:14:00] way off into eternity, I saw a
[1:14:02] constellation of something coming. It
[1:14:04] looked like it might have been little
[1:14:05] dots. There could have been no less than
[1:14:06] five, not more than seven. But they were
[1:14:08] in the shape of a pyramid, like these
[1:14:10] messengers coming. He said, "When it
[1:14:12] did, the power of all mighty God lifted
[1:14:13] me up to meet
[1:14:16] them." So when he had the vision, he
[1:14:18] didn't know what it meant. That's an
[1:14:19] important thing to understand about a
[1:14:21] prophet. A prophet when he has a vision
[1:14:23] doesn't always know what the vision
[1:14:25] means. But he's watching for the
[1:14:27] fulfillment of the vision. Give you an
[1:14:29] example. When David uh said, "My bones,
[1:14:32] they stare at me." He was under
[1:14:34] inspiration. He didn't People look at
[1:14:35] him and say, "You're crazy, David.
[1:14:37] You've not been beaten like that."
[1:14:39] Right? But but he was talking about a
[1:14:41] future happening. And yet he might have
[1:14:43] looked for it to happen in his day. We
[1:14:45] know that Isaiah when he spoke of virgin
[1:14:48] shall conceive, every virgin thought,
[1:14:49] "Well, that might be me." And so they
[1:14:51] were waiting for that to happen, right?
[1:14:54] did he was looking for that even in his
[1:14:55] day. He did not know what the
[1:14:57] fulfillment was. Brother Brandham
[1:14:58] initially doesn't know what the
[1:15:00] fulfillment was. But this message
[1:15:02] doesn't just didn't just bring us out,
[1:15:04] but it also takes us in. Right? So, we
[1:15:06] got to see the prophecy and the
[1:15:08] fulfillment of the prophecy in brother
[1:15:11] Brandham's ministry. I look, he said
[1:15:13] when he had the vision, he didn't know
[1:15:14] what it meant. I turned again. I
[1:15:15] thought, Lord God, what does this vision
[1:15:18] mean? And I wondered, he said, and then
[1:15:19] it come to me, not a voice just come to
[1:15:21] me. Oh, he said that is the angels of
[1:15:23] the Lord coming to give me my new
[1:15:24] commission. When I thought that, I
[1:15:26] raised up my hands. I said, "Oh Lord
[1:15:28] Jesus, what will you have me to
[1:15:31] do?" So the interpretation didn't come
[1:15:34] immediately. And he picks up on that. He
[1:15:36] said, "The reason I think the
[1:15:37] interpretation never come immediately,"
[1:15:39] he said, "It was by the sovereignty of
[1:15:41] God because I believe it's wrote out
[1:15:43] here in the Bible for me." And then if
[1:15:46] it's scriptural, it's only the scripture
[1:15:49] can interpret it.
[1:15:51] So remember there's a blast or a thunder
[1:15:54] and so he goes to the scripture in
[1:15:55] Revelation
[1:15:56] 10 and this is where brother Brand ties
[1:15:59] it to and is this the sign of the sir.
[1:16:02] He said I s I saw another mighty angel
[1:16:04] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:16:05] cloud rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:16:07] face was were the sun and his feet as
[1:16:09] pillars of fire. He had in his hand a
[1:16:11] little book open. He set his right foot
[1:16:12] upon the sea, his left foot on the earth
[1:16:14] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:16:16] lion roarth. When he cried, seven
[1:16:18] thunders uttered their voices. And when
[1:16:20] the seven thunders had uttered their
[1:16:22] voices, I was about to write. And I
[1:16:23] heard a voice from heaven, saying unto
[1:16:25] me, Seal up those things which are in
[1:16:27] which the seven thunders uttered, and
[1:16:28] write them not. And the angel which I
[1:16:30] saw stand upon the sea, and upon the
[1:16:31] earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and
[1:16:33] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:16:35] ever, who created heaven, and the things
[1:16:36] that therein are, and the earth, and the
[1:16:38] things that therein are, and the sea,
[1:16:39] and the things which are there, that
[1:16:41] there should be time no longer, but in
[1:16:44] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:16:46] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:16:48] mystery of God,
[1:16:50] should be finished as he has declared to
[1:16:52] his servants the prophets. So brother
[1:16:53] Brand picks up on that said it's the
[1:16:54] seventh angel messenger's job to reveal
[1:16:58] the mystery of the seven
[1:17:00] thunders. All
[1:17:02] right. Now, brother Brown said, "There's
[1:17:05] only one thing left. That seven thunders
[1:17:07] we don't know." This was in 1962. He
[1:17:10] said, "And it would not have thundered
[1:17:11] in vain." Because he talks about, he
[1:17:13] said, "Every sound has a significance.
[1:17:14] God don't do anything just
[1:17:16] half-hazardly." And seven thunders right
[1:17:18] in the revelation here Jesus Christ.
[1:17:20] It's some mystery. He said, "Does not
[1:17:21] the Bible say that this is the
[1:17:22] revelation of Jesus Christ?" This is the
[1:17:25] revelation of Jesus Christ. Why? There
[1:17:26] is some hidden mystery then of it. What
[1:17:28] is it? The seven thunders have it. for
[1:17:30] John was just about to write and the
[1:17:31] voice come down from heaven said don't
[1:17:33] write it but seal it seal it up put it
[1:17:35] on the back side of the book it's got to
[1:17:36] be revealed it's the mysteries later on
[1:17:38] brother Brandham takes it and he says
[1:17:40] well it's not something just on the back
[1:17:42] side of the book he said but it's
[1:17:43] something actually in the book right but
[1:17:46] it was
[1:17:47] sealed amen so brother Brandham points
[1:17:50] out that this angel of Revelation 10:1
[1:17:53] come down from heaven I'm going
[1:17:55] somewhere so just hang with me for a
[1:17:57] minute and he said this angel comes not
[1:17:59] to the earth. He isn't a man from the
[1:18:00] earth as the Oh, so many people have
[1:18:03] missed this. See, brother Brandon wasn't
[1:18:05] the son of man. This angel
[1:18:09] was right. The son of man who would
[1:18:12] reveal himself in a son of man and in a
[1:18:15] bride and a son of man moves in bride
[1:18:18] form. That's what a prophet told us. But
[1:18:20] but but he was not a son of man. He he
[1:18:22] was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:18:24] man. This angel come not to the earth.
[1:18:25] He isn't a man from the earth as the
[1:18:27] messenger of the church ages. That's
[1:18:29] finished. But this angel brings the next
[1:18:32] announcement. Glory to God. People still
[1:18:34] looking for another messenger, an eighth
[1:18:36] day or something like that. This angel
[1:18:37] brought the next announcement. Who is
[1:18:39] this angel? He said, "An angel means the
[1:18:42] messenger. He comes down from heaven
[1:18:44] clothed in that pillar of light cloud
[1:18:46] with a rainbow over his head." This was,
[1:18:49] listen to me, church. We got the cloud
[1:18:50] picture. This was
[1:18:52] before the cloud picture. He told us
[1:18:55] what was going to happen. He'd come down
[1:18:57] from heaven clothed in that pillar of
[1:18:59] light, cloud with a rainbow over his
[1:19:00] head. A rainbow was a covenant. It was
[1:19:02] Christ with one foot on land, one on the
[1:19:04] sea, and swore time will be no more.
[1:19:06] Where are we at, sir? What's all this
[1:19:08] about? He said, I'm asking
[1:19:11] you. Hallelujah. He said, all the others
[1:19:14] came from the earth, but this one didn't
[1:19:15] come from the earth. He Oh, God, I'm so
[1:19:17] glad. In order to get out of here,
[1:19:18] church, we had to have a messenger that
[1:19:20] didn't come from the earth. He come from
[1:19:22] heaven. And that messenger was not a
[1:19:24] man, but he lived in a man. and he lives
[1:19:26] in you and me. That messenger is going
[1:19:28] to get us out of Leona. That messenger
[1:19:30] is going to teach us all
[1:19:32] things.
[1:19:35] Hallelujah. This one didn't come from
[1:19:37] the earth. He come down from heaven
[1:19:38] because the mystery is all finished. And
[1:19:40] when the mystery is finished, angel
[1:19:41] said, "Time shall be no more." Seven
[1:19:43] thunders stood their voices out. He
[1:19:45] said, "What if?" Oh, he didn't know how
[1:19:46] close he was. He didn't know how listen
[1:19:50] to a prophet speaking prophetically
[1:19:51] because that's what prophets do. What if
[1:19:54] it's something to let us know how to
[1:19:55] enter into rapturing faith? Is it will
[1:19:58] we run leap over walls? Is there
[1:20:00] something fixing to happen? These old
[1:20:02] barred, vile bodies are going to be
[1:20:04] changed. He said, "Can I live to see it,
[1:20:06] oh Lord? Is it so close that I'll see
[1:20:08] it? Is this the generation, sir, my
[1:20:10] brethren? What time is it? Where are we
[1:20:15] at?" So, you never know when prophecy
[1:20:18] might become history.
[1:20:21] So, a few months later, Brother Brandham
[1:20:23] is hunting
[1:20:25] hogs. Somebody needs to hunt some hogs
[1:20:28] around
[1:20:29] here. Yard was all tore up the other
[1:20:32] day. He was hunting hogs. And when he
[1:20:35] was hunting hogs, you know, he said, "I
[1:20:38] wasn't even thinking about the
[1:20:39] prophecy." Well, I believe the rapture
[1:20:41] is going to come like that.
[1:20:45] one day we're just we're just gonna be
[1:20:46] going about our everyday business not
[1:20:48] even thinking about it. He said I wasn't
[1:20:50] even thinking about the prophecies. He
[1:20:53] said and I leaned down and pick a copper
[1:20:55] off of my trousers. Oh my. And he said
[1:20:58] when he did he heard that blast that
[1:21:02] he'd heard in the
[1:21:04] vision. He describes it like this. He
[1:21:06] said I started up the mountain running
[1:21:08] as hard as I could on the other side.
[1:21:09] All of a sudden I thought somebody shot
[1:21:11] me. I never heard such a blast. shook
[1:21:13] the whole country. And when it did,
[1:21:14] standing before me was seven angels in a
[1:21:18] cluster. And so when it's over, he meets
[1:21:21] Fred Sman. And Fred Sman tells him,
[1:21:23] said, "What was it?" He replied, "That
[1:21:25] was it."
[1:21:29] What was it? Prophecy becoming history.
[1:21:32] Are you with me, church? That was it.
[1:21:35] What did Peter say on the day of
[1:21:36] Pentecost? This is that. Brother Brandon
[1:21:39] said that was it. That was what the
[1:21:41] prophecy from. Is this the sign of the
[1:21:42] inner sir? Right? And he said that was
[1:21:45] it. He said, "What will you do?" He
[1:21:47] said, "Return home for thus sayith the
[1:21:48] Lord, the seven mysteries that's been
[1:21:50] hidden the Bible all these years, these
[1:21:52] denominations and everything. God is
[1:21:54] going to open those seven mysteries to
[1:21:56] us in the seven
[1:21:58] seals." He said there was that circle
[1:22:00] coming up from the earth like a mist
[1:22:01] forming when it did and went plump into
[1:22:03] the mountain begin to circle on
[1:22:04] westward. He said from the way it comes,
[1:22:06] science found it after a while 30 miles
[1:22:08] high, 25 miles across just exactly in
[1:22:10] the form of a pyramid. I think I put a
[1:22:11] picture of the cloud in
[1:22:13] there and he said the other day standing
[1:22:16] there turn the picture to the right. The
[1:22:17] picture you remember from the earth was
[1:22:19] turned the other way but he said turn it
[1:22:21] to the right. He said and there is Jesus
[1:22:22] as he was in the seven church ages the
[1:22:25] white gone showing supreme deity.
[1:22:32] Hello church and you say well what what
[1:22:35] did it mean? Brother Bham told us what
[1:22:36] it meant. He's alpha and omega. He's the
[1:22:39] first and the last. He's the supreme
[1:22:41] judge of all eternity
[1:22:44] standing there to confirm the message of
[1:22:46] this hour. Listen, we have not followed
[1:22:48] cunningly devised fables. But prophecy
[1:22:51] has become history. I'm going somewhere.
[1:22:53] Hang with me this morning. He he said
[1:22:55] the white wig on showing supreme deities
[1:22:57] outfit and omega. He's the supreme judge
[1:22:59] of all eternity standing there to
[1:23:00] confirm the message of this hour and
[1:23:02] there shall be light about the evening
[1:23:04] time. What was it? That prophecy that
[1:23:07] Zachchariah prophesied was coming to
[1:23:10] pass. What's happened upon mount sunset?
[1:23:12] He said God confirming his word. This is
[1:23:15] from what is the attraction on the
[1:23:16] mountain which was preached three years
[1:23:19] after. Is this the sign of the end sir?
[1:23:21] What happened in the meantime? The seals
[1:23:22] were
[1:23:23] preached. He said that's what all this
[1:23:25] noise is about. He said notice it's God
[1:23:28] fulfilling his promised word again of
[1:23:30] Revelation 10 1-7.
[1:23:33] In the days of the sounding of the
[1:23:35] seventh angel's message, the mystery of
[1:23:37] God should be finished. The hidden
[1:23:38] mystery of Revelation 10 1-7. The last
[1:23:42] message to the last church age fulfills
[1:23:43] exactly in this age. In this age, St.
[1:23:46] Luke 17:30, the day when the son of man
[1:23:49] shall be
[1:23:50] revealed again. He said, I don't have
[1:23:52] time to read it all to you, but you can
[1:23:53] go read read the the book or listen to
[1:23:55] the tape. What is the attraction on the
[1:23:57] mountain? He says, the God of heaven
[1:23:58] promised the evening time would have
[1:23:59] evening lights. Three years ago, this
[1:24:02] mystery was a
[1:24:05] prophecy. What time is it, sir? But
[1:24:09] now, I'm telling you something this
[1:24:11] morning. I think I think we're kind of
[1:24:13] missing it. Look,
[1:24:15] look. What was prophecy? He said, "Now
[1:24:18] it's history." Can you
[1:24:21] identify prophecy becoming history?
[1:24:25] Not just in the message, not just in the
[1:24:28] life of a prophet, but can you identify
[1:24:31] it in your own life?
[1:24:33] Because if you can if you can identify
[1:24:35] prophecy by the church becoming history
[1:24:37] in your family, if you can identify
[1:24:39] prophecy becoming history by the new
[1:24:41] birth in your own heart, if you can
[1:24:42] identify prophecy becoming history by
[1:24:44] God keeping his word on healing and all
[1:24:47] these other things, then why would it be
[1:24:48] hard to identify prophecy when it
[1:24:50] becomes history and our bodies are
[1:24:52] changed?
[1:24:55] Hey
[1:24:56] man, I got to slow
[1:24:58] down. Now look, not timewise, just I'll
[1:25:03] get you out of here in time to eat. The
[1:25:05] ham takes a little time to warm up
[1:25:10] anyway. Said three years ago, look how a
[1:25:13] prophet identified this mystery was a
[1:25:15] prophecy. What time is it? Now it's
[1:25:16] history. It's passed. The promise is
[1:25:18] fulfilled. That's powerful. What time is
[1:25:22] it, sir? And what's this attraction?
[1:25:24] Look at him. Tie it together. God
[1:25:27] fulfilling his word. He's the same
[1:25:30] yesterday, today, and forever. I know
[1:25:33] there's people still looking for that to
[1:25:34] happen, but thank God, prophecy has
[1:25:36] become
[1:25:37] history. That prophecy has become
[1:25:40] history. The evening light has brought
[1:25:42] the seed to its maturity. We're living
[1:25:44] in the very top, the very end of the
[1:25:46] end. How could we put that off into the
[1:25:49] future? We can't. It's already happened.
[1:25:53] Right. You know, you you could tell
[1:25:56] me I don't usually do illustrations on
[1:25:59] the fly, but you know, you could tell me
[1:26:02] say, "Brother Ben, when you get to
[1:26:06] Jonesboro, you'll see Sam's Club because
[1:26:09] that's the only place we go in
[1:26:11] Jonesboro." Or seems like when you get
[1:26:13] to Jonesboro, you'll see Sam's Club.
[1:26:16] There'll be a sign and you'll see an
[1:26:17] IHOP sitting in front of it because I
[1:26:20] always want to go there and never have
[1:26:21] time when we go to Sam's
[1:26:24] Club. Have you ever seen an IHOP you
[1:26:26] didn't want to go
[1:26:28] into? Just
[1:26:32] saying. But I but you you tell me that
[1:26:35] say, "Brother Ben, when you get
[1:26:37] there, this is coming. It's going to be
[1:26:40] there." Why? Because you have an insight
[1:26:41] maybe that I didn't have. But once I've
[1:26:43] been there, I can't deny. You don't have
[1:26:47] to tell
[1:26:49] me. It's already happened. When I got
[1:26:52] there, IHOP was there and I ate the
[1:26:55] pancakes and I went to Sam's Club and
[1:26:58] spent
[1:27:01] $600. And it happened. I can't deny
[1:27:05] that. And you can keep telling me,
[1:27:06] "Brother Ben, when you get there, this
[1:27:08] is what's going to happen." No, that
[1:27:09] that's that's something that already
[1:27:11] happened.
[1:27:12] Amen. What I need to know is what's
[1:27:15] going to happen. Are you with me now?
[1:27:18] Something has already happened. A
[1:27:19] prophet has already come.
[1:27:22] Hallelujah. He already revealed the
[1:27:23] mysteries. The seven thunders were
[1:27:25] already already sounded. The the the the
[1:27:27] mystery. They were the mysteries
[1:27:28] contained in the seals. That's what
[1:27:30] brother Brandham said they were. I don't
[1:27:31] have to look for nothing else. It
[1:27:33] already happened. I can't deny. I don't
[1:27:35] have to be equivocical about it. I've
[1:27:36] already been there. I've seen it. Once
[1:27:39] I've seen it, I can't unsee it.
[1:27:42] But what's in the future? Look at 1
[1:27:43] Thessalonians
[1:27:46] 4:16. For the Lord himself should ascend
[1:27:49] from heaven with a shout. Now wait just
[1:27:52] a
[1:27:53] minute. That was
[1:27:56] prophecy. That's
[1:28:00] history. Because brother Brandon told us
[1:28:02] a shout. What is the shout? It's the
[1:28:03] message going first. The living bread of
[1:28:05] life bringing forth the
[1:28:09] bride. Hallelujah.
[1:28:11] I know there will be a literal change of
[1:28:14] the body, but he's already on his way.
[1:28:16] See, you can't. It's already set in
[1:28:18] motion. That ought to give us an
[1:28:20] assurance, church. I know people the big
[1:28:23] reluctance to say, "Well, if I believe
[1:28:24] the message, if I go to a message
[1:28:25] church, I got to live like this." It's
[1:28:29] not that hard when you realize what he's
[1:28:30] already done,
[1:28:32] right? He's already promised to live in
[1:28:35] you. He's already promised to help you.
[1:28:38] He's already promised the the same one
[1:28:40] who was showed himself in the clouds.
[1:28:42] The same one who come down on Mount
[1:28:44] Sunset. The same one who spoke the word.
[1:28:46] The same one who revealed the secret of
[1:28:47] the heart said, "I'll be with you. I'll
[1:28:49] be in you even to the end of the age."
[1:28:51] That same church, that same son of man
[1:28:53] is still here today to live in your
[1:28:56] body. He wants to reveal himself through
[1:28:59] you and through me. He wants you to be
[1:29:01] like him.
[1:29:02] To have many sons and daughters. The
[1:29:05] sheath that was waved over us now has
[1:29:07] come back. It's a wave loaf. We've been
[1:29:10] we've been baked in the heat of the hour
[1:29:12] under the under the word of the hour and
[1:29:14] now we come forth what God wants us to
[1:29:17] be. Brother Brown said to be bread on
[1:29:19] his table.
[1:29:21] Hallelujah. He has descended with a
[1:29:24] shout. Said with the voice of the
[1:29:26] archangel, with the trump of God, the
[1:29:27] dead in Christ shall rise first. Now
[1:29:29] that's
[1:29:31] prophecy. Now
[1:29:34] look what what are we waiting on? What's
[1:29:37] left? The dead in Christ shall rise
[1:29:41] first. That's why you have to rightly
[1:29:42] divide the word. Right? Just like
[1:29:44] Malachi 4, Malachi 3, Malachi 4, you
[1:29:47] have to rightly divide between John and
[1:29:49] brother Brandon, right? You got to
[1:29:51] rightly divide it. You got to rightly
[1:29:52] divide 1 Thessalonians 4. What's already
[1:29:54] happened? What's looking we're looking
[1:29:55] for? What are we looking for? Dead in
[1:29:59] Christ. Prophecy has become history.
[1:30:01] We're waiting on the dead in Christ to
[1:30:03] rise. 1 Thessalonians 4:17. Then
[1:30:07] Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] We which are alive and remain shall be
[1:30:11] caught up together with them in the
[1:30:14] clouds.
[1:30:16] Hallelujah. Oh, we come in a cloud. But
[1:30:18] he said we'll be caught up together with
[1:30:20] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:30:22] the air. And so shall we ever be with
[1:30:26] the
[1:30:27] Lord. I've read that over and over again
[1:30:30] standing at gravesides.
[1:30:34] I don't know how many times I stood at a
[1:30:36] graveside as we as we bury the body of a
[1:30:39] saint and I've read this scripture. I
[1:30:41] almost always read it as we commit the
[1:30:43] body to the dust because I want people
[1:30:46] to know we believe
[1:30:50] that some morning prophecy is going to
[1:30:52] become history.
[1:30:56] Oh, that ought to give us hope today,
[1:30:57] church. It ought to it ought to put
[1:30:59] courage in our heart to live the word to
[1:31:01] do what God's called us to do. Someday
[1:31:03] it's going to become history. I know
[1:31:04] you're looking forward to life and
[1:31:06] things and some of y'all brother Riley's
[1:31:08] getting married just about to go on a
[1:31:09] honeymoon and and he's looking forward
[1:31:11] to that trip and the things and being
[1:31:13] married and but I'll tell you what, some
[1:31:15] morning. It may be while you're on your
[1:31:16] honeymoon. It might be this morning. It
[1:31:18] might be the next week or the next year.
[1:31:19] I don't know when, but some morning
[1:31:21] we're going to start seeing our loved
[1:31:22] ones come. And when we see them start to
[1:31:24] come, what's going to happen? Suddenly,
[1:31:26] he said a great sweep will go over us.
[1:31:29] will be changed from these bodies into
[1:31:31] bodies like his glorious body all of a
[1:31:34] sudden will be gone.
[1:31:37] Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] Hallelujah.
[1:31:41] Prophecy becoming history. Behold, I
[1:31:43] show you a
[1:31:45] mystery. This was prophecy. We shall not
[1:31:48] all sleep, but we shall all be changed
[1:31:52] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[1:31:54] at the last trump. For the trumpet shall
[1:31:56] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[1:31:57] incorruptible, and we shall be
[1:32:02] changed.
[1:32:07] Prophecy. Some of you elders may go by
[1:32:09] way of the grave. Some of our younger
[1:32:10] people might. God forbid. But yet, that
[1:32:14] happens.
[1:32:16] But we stand on this truth that the God
[1:32:20] who made himself present in our day and
[1:32:23] stood there on Mount Sunset. That same
[1:32:26] God who stood in a prophet, that same
[1:32:28] God who changed my life, that same God
[1:32:31] who brought who is the reason why this
[1:32:33] church exists, that same God that you
[1:32:34] feel his presence this morning, that
[1:32:36] same God one morning is going to change
[1:32:39] your body.
[1:32:43] said someday a sweep will come over us.
[1:32:47] The moment in the twinkle of an eye, the
[1:32:49] last trump the trumpet shall sound. The
[1:32:50] dead shall be raised incorruptible and
[1:32:51] we shall be changed. What is that sweep
[1:32:55] that comes over us? Prophecy becoming
[1:32:57] history. Brother said the same presence
[1:32:59] that you
[1:33:01] feel. That's why we love him so much.
[1:33:04] That's why we spend time in his
[1:33:06] presence. That's why we don't hurry but
[1:33:07] we worship him. Even at the end of the
[1:33:10] service, we want to lift our hands and
[1:33:11] worship him. Why? That same presence
[1:33:13] that we feel.
[1:33:17] It's the same presence that's going to
[1:33:18] take us
[1:33:20] home. Hallelujah. Might be washing the
[1:33:23] dishes as a man wipeth the dish. Found
[1:33:26] out the other day that was for men. I
[1:33:28] didn't know that. Thank you, Sister
[1:33:30] Allison. I appreciate that revelation.
[1:33:36] You men might be standing there wiping
[1:33:38] the
[1:33:39] dish and one
[1:33:42] day that moment you don't you may not be
[1:33:44] doing something
[1:33:47] spiritual but in a
[1:33:50] moment in the twinkling of an
[1:33:53] eye at the last trump the dead shall be
[1:33:57] raised incorruptible and we shall be
[1:34:01] changed when the presence of God comes
[1:34:03] among us comes into the
[1:34:06] service. Many will say, "Who is
[1:34:11] this?" And those who really believe
[1:34:14] said, "But you don't know what's about
[1:34:15] to
[1:34:17] happen. This is prophecy becoming
[1:34:20] history." And the if this part became
[1:34:23] history, if he's coming riding down the
[1:34:26] mountain, then the part about him dying
[1:34:29] for our sins and being raised again on
[1:34:31] the third day, that must be true as
[1:34:34] well. It happened, church. What was it?
[1:34:37] There was a few that believed. Many
[1:34:40] said, "Who is this?" But there was a few
[1:34:42] who said,
[1:34:43] "Hosana. Hosana to the king."
[1:34:47] Hallelujah. They recognized that he was
[1:34:50] about, oh church, he was about to
[1:34:52] fulfill all the prophecies that had been
[1:34:55] spoken of a Messiah because he fulfilled
[1:34:57] one. What did he do in our day? Oh
[1:34:59] church, he come and fulfilled Malachi 4.
[1:35:02] He come and fulfilled Revelation 10 1-7.
[1:35:04] He come and fulfill Revelation or Luke
[1:35:06] 17:30. What was he doing? He was showing
[1:35:09] us if this happened, then this other's
[1:35:11] got to happen. If he could come and and
[1:35:13] restore the hearts of the people back,
[1:35:15] then he must come and change our
[1:35:18] bodies.
[1:35:20] Hallelujah. And they the Pharisees said,
[1:35:24] "Oh, we got some Pharisees today." But
[1:35:27] the Pharisees said, "Make them hold
[1:35:28] their peace. They're too loud."
[1:35:31] And Jesus said, "If they hold their
[1:35:33] peace, the rocks will cry out." You
[1:35:34] don't understand. It's a simulation of
[1:35:37] revelation. Prophecy is becoming
[1:35:39] history.
[1:35:40] Oh, thank the Lord. I'm seeing it today.
[1:35:43] I'm seeing it with eyes of faith. I
[1:35:45] don't look at the I don't I'm not going
[1:35:46] to look at the doom and gloom. I'm not
[1:35:48] going to look at the world. I'm not
[1:35:49] going to look at the condition of the
[1:35:50] people, but I'm going to look at the
[1:35:51] promise that's said in a moment, in a
[1:35:53] twinkling of an eye. I'm looking at the
[1:35:55] promise of a restored people. And I
[1:35:57] believe I'm looking at that restored
[1:35:58] people. I'm looking at a bride without
[1:36:00] spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of
[1:36:02] the lamb. What prophecy could become
[1:36:04] history this morning? Think about it. In
[1:36:07] his presence, prophecy becomes history.
[1:36:10] Hallelujah. And when you recognize that
[1:36:13] prophecy becoming history, how can we
[1:36:15] hold our
[1:36:17] peace?
[1:36:19] Hallelujah. John 14:12, this is
[1:36:21] prophecy. Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:36:22] you, he that believeth on me. works that
[1:36:24] I do shall he do also and greater works
[1:36:26] than these shall he do because I go to
[1:36:28] my
[1:36:29] father. Mark 16:17, this is prophecy.
[1:36:33] These signs shall follow them that
[1:36:34] believe my name. They shall they cast
[1:36:36] out devils. They shall speak with new
[1:36:38] tongues. They shall take up serpents. If
[1:36:40] they drink any deadly thing, it shall
[1:36:42] not hurt them. They shall lay hands on
[1:36:44] the sick and they shall
[1:36:47] recover. Hallelujah. Prophecy.
[1:36:51] Now look, them disciples received
[1:36:53] quickening power on the day of
[1:36:55] Pentecost. The brother said, "What did
[1:36:57] they do?" They went out and laid hands
[1:36:58] on the sick and they
[1:37:01] recovered. What happened, church?
[1:37:04] Prophecy became
[1:37:06] history. Jesus said in Mark 16, "It'll
[1:37:08] continue on to the end of the world." I
[1:37:12] know people don't believe in laying on
[1:37:13] of hands today, but Jesus said it'll
[1:37:17] continue to the end of the world. How
[1:37:19] long? To the apostles age. Go you into
[1:37:21] all the world, preach the gospel to
[1:37:23] every
[1:37:24] creature. These signs will follow them
[1:37:26] that believe. If they lay their hands on
[1:37:28] the sick, they shall recover. He said
[1:37:30] that's the quickening power like was on
[1:37:32] Elijah's bone. Elisha's bones. Now file
[1:37:36] that in your memory for next week.
[1:37:38] That's the quickening power like was on
[1:37:40] Elisha's bones. And the same quickening
[1:37:43] power. Someone say the same. The same
[1:37:46] quickening power. Listen to me, church.
[1:37:50] Hallelujah. Is upon the
[1:37:52] saints that raised them up.
[1:37:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if listen,
[1:38:00] the ones that raised in Jesus time were
[1:38:02] raised up by the quickening power. And
[1:38:05] if that same, someone say with me, same
[1:38:08] quickening power is in us.
[1:38:11] Lay your hands on the sick.
[1:38:17] He didn't say just preachers. He said
[1:38:20] believers.
[1:38:22] I'm closing now. He didn't say just
[1:38:24] preachers, believers, lay your hands on
[1:38:26] the sick. Hallelujah. When that baby
[1:38:29] gets is sick and and need somebody lay
[1:38:31] hands on them. Lay your hands on the
[1:38:32] sick.
[1:38:34] Oh, I I love you. If you if you call for
[1:38:37] your pastor, I'd love to pray for your
[1:38:38] children, pray for you. But don't you
[1:38:40] realize that you have that same
[1:38:41] quickening power that I believe I have
[1:38:43] inside of me? That same quickening power
[1:38:45] is inside of you. And you can lay hands
[1:38:48] on the sick and they shall not they
[1:38:50] might but they shall recover.
[1:38:53] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said, "I've
[1:38:55] noticed here I've almost quit having
[1:38:57] discernment anymore." Everybody says,
[1:38:58] "Oh, if we only had discernment
[1:39:01] back." Brother Brandham said, "I I've
[1:39:03] noticed I'm not using." And you'll
[1:39:05] notice the end of his ministry, he
[1:39:06] doesn't use it as much. He said, "I've
[1:39:08] almost quit having discernment anymore.
[1:39:10] Just lay my hands on the
[1:39:11] sick." First of all, he said, "I could
[1:39:13] get to more people." He said, "I found
[1:39:16] out better results. I love this. By just
[1:39:20] getting myself into God's
[1:39:23] arms and saying, "Lord God, you promised
[1:39:27] it. It's your promises. It's your
[1:39:30] promise. It's not mine. It's yours. And
[1:39:33] you promised you would do it. And I've
[1:39:36] seen you do it." Oh, that's how you'd
[1:39:39] crawl up in his arms. Just remind him of
[1:39:40] his
[1:39:41] promises. I've seen you do it. I'm going
[1:39:44] to believe you're going to do it because
[1:39:46] I've been baptized into your body and
[1:39:48] your spirit here to
[1:39:50] identify. That's the truth. Now, I want
[1:39:52] to challenge you this morning before the
[1:39:53] musicians come. Before they come, while
[1:39:55] you're sitting in your seats, I want to
[1:39:56] challenge you this morning. Do you
[1:39:58] believe that prophecy can become history
[1:40:00] right here?
[1:40:02] Many of you at the beginning of the
[1:40:03] service raised your hand. You had a need
[1:40:04] in your life. Do you believe that the
[1:40:07] person sitting next to you has got
[1:40:08] quickening power? That you've got
[1:40:10] quickening power in your hands.
[1:40:12] Hallelujah. Where was the quickening
[1:40:14] power? Was in the body. Was in the body
[1:40:17] of believers. Hallelujah. Elisha was a
[1:40:20] type of the bride. I'm getting I'm
[1:40:21] getting into next week. Elisha was a
[1:40:22] type of the bride and the quickening
[1:40:24] power is in the body. Then if we can
[1:40:27] believe that today, all things are
[1:40:29] possible. I want you to lay hands on one
[1:40:31] another. Brother, sis, brother and
[1:40:34] sister in in the order of the of the
[1:40:36] Lord. Just lay hands on somebody. If you
[1:40:38] don't have somebody sitting right by
[1:40:39] you, find somebody to lay hands on. That
[1:40:42] touch
[1:40:43] matters. Oh my. Oh my. Do you believe
[1:40:48] that prophecy can become history right
[1:40:52] now? Do you believe as I lay my hands
[1:40:55] I'm gonna lay my hands on these young
[1:40:56] men and you young men lay hands on one
[1:40:58] another. Prophecy can become history
[1:41:01] right now. They shall lay hands on the
[1:41:03] sick and they shall recover. That's a
[1:41:05] prophecy and it's about to become
[1:41:07] history by the laying on of hands.
[1:41:08] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we lift our
[1:41:11] voices to you. We lift our hearts to you
[1:41:13] today, oh God. Lord, as we pray one for
[1:41:15] another, I pray, God, that you'd heal
[1:41:18] this young man and these young men on
[1:41:19] the front row, oh God, I pray you'd
[1:41:21] strengthen them, Lord. I pray you'd move
[1:41:23] through them, oh God. I pray for the
[1:41:25] church this morning and each one Lord as
[1:41:27] through the laying on of hands of
[1:41:29] believers God that they would be healed
[1:41:31] that they would be delivered that they
[1:41:33] would be strengthened oh God I know Lord
[1:41:35] it's not the strength of my prayer but
[1:41:37] you said the effectual fervent prayer of
[1:41:39] a righteous man availth much and I don't
[1:41:41] stand in my own righteousness today but
[1:41:43] I stand upon the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:41:45] and we condemn every devil and every
[1:41:48] every sickness and every every bit of
[1:41:51] thing that would exalt itself against
[1:41:52] you every backsliding condition. Lord,
[1:41:54] we cast it out this morning and we
[1:41:56] believe that healing will come to the
[1:41:58] body. I pray you grant it right now,
[1:42:00] Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Do you
[1:42:04] believe? Come on, church. Prophecy just
[1:42:07] became history. If you can believe it,
[1:42:10] you have what you asked for today
[1:42:12] because you could believe it.
[1:42:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why don't you
[1:42:15] worship him this morning? Why don't we
[1:42:18] just raise our hands to him and worship
[1:42:19] him? Musicians, go ahead and come. Let's
[1:42:21] just worship him this morning. Lord, you
[1:42:23] we love you today. We thank you for your
[1:42:26] mercy. Thank you that prophecies become
[1:42:28] history. Thank you, Lord, that it can
[1:42:30] still happen in our day. That that
[1:42:32] remains a prophecy to every person that
[1:42:34] can believe it and make it history down
[1:42:36] to the end of time. I thank you for it,
[1:42:39] Lord. I worship you today, Lord Jesus. I
[1:42:42] thank you for your love. I thank you for
[1:42:43] your goodness. Thank you for healing.
