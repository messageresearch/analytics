we don't have anything in common with but tonight we're GA with a group of people that we have everything in common with that Lord that we're we're headed for a new land a Rapture in front of us Lord the world behind us Lord and so we take these moments to Fellowship together and to Fellowship around your word Lord most of all to receive correction from you and strength and peace and whatever we have need of Lord we know you're able to provide it I pray you do that tonight and I pray that you just move in your own special way Lord move me out of the way and speak directly to your people we pray in Jesus name amen amen I want us to turn to Ephesians 4:11 tonight Ephesians 41-13 I wanted to say thank you to all those who helped the weekend of the special services what weren't we blessed by the word of the Lord such a wonderful time and and I want to say thank you for helping I neglected to do that on Sunday uh we more folks showed up than what I expected what we kind of expected but we uh sure did appreciate all those that came came and and you as a church and your hospitality and welcoming people and I appreciate that very much it it shows that you're Christians and uh the Bible says they'll know that you're my disciples because of your love one for another and I believe you have that and so we're thankful for that tonight and U I want to begin a thought tonight uh the Lord would help me on building you building you and I mean by that building the individual and we may continue this on Sunday morning that's kind of different than what we normally do I want you to kind of pay attention and it's just a lot that I won't be able to get to all tonight so we may deal with that again on Sunday morning if the Lord's willing uh Sunday afternoon I want to have uh Service uh with the youth especially the older youth I want to deal with something uh regarding dating and relationships doesn't that sound fun and uh we're going to talk about that I've never dealt with that here and so we're going to do that on on Sunday uh afternoon so you young people try to be here and those that aren't able to be here tonight try to be here on Sunday afternoon I'm sure it'll be a blessing to you uh we'll we'll have our communion service the first Sunday in March brother Harvey if we'll go ahead and do that that that week can give us time to put things back together and uh you remind me of that so we don't forget amen amen Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man un to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ I pray the Lord with add his Blessing to the word you may be seated man named Roy Sullivan was struck by lightning seven times that's pretty hard to do he uh I think the odds of of getting struck by lightning twice is something like one in N million he was struck by lightning in 1942 and lost a nail on his big toe he was struck by lightning in 69 70 72 73 76 and 77 suffered injuries to his shoulder his ankle his chest and and the strike in 72 even caused his hair to catch on fire in 1973 he was struck again he cost he he caused him to lose the hair he' just grown back and it's hard to believe someone could be that unlucky as we would call it but you know he didn't die from that he actually committed suicide died from his own hand and uh and all those times you know I don't know you you probably would feel like the unluckiest person in the world if you'd been struck by lightning seven times and yet if you'd been struck by lightning seven times and it didn't kill you right you'd have to feel pretty blessed but he didn't see it that way a lot of it is our Viewpoint yeah right and I know that many times we we we we tend to take on a a victim mentality we tend to uh we become a victim of circumstances and and and and people life can be hard and we recognize that some people have a much harder life than others it just seems like they're marked for for difficulty and yet uh one of that's one of the most difficult things as a pastor is to get people to see beyond that and see that the things that come to them are actually ordered of the Lord and we are not victims in fact we are Victors tonight we we cannot be victims according to the word of the Lord so we have to be able to uh to look away from our circumstances and look away from how we've lived and look away from what has happened to us and see something brother the eyesa that's more real than the reality of what we've gone through if we're not careful we I think a good example example of of this is is Marxism you know in Marxism uh I'm a victim of electronics actually tonight but but uh messing up but Marxism is a is a victim mentality and what they taught the people is that you're poor because of the circumstances of your life and and and many times that's true but they said because of that it gives you the right that if you can collectively gather together and overthrow the system that gives you the right to to do what whatever you want to do to the oppressor class to the ones who owned everything it gives you the right to just uh do whatever it is that you want to do and and because you're a victim and it it it it separated people into groups and labeled those people I think we have a form of that today and you see it on social media feeds that uh we give ourselves all kinds of names for uh for to that make us victims and we become a victim to some illness or a victim to some mental state or a victim to some uh way that we are and say well this is just the way I am but that's not what the gospel teaches us the gospel teaches us that whatever condition we are in whatever state our mind is in whatever state our body is in We are never a victim of our circumstances but our life can be changed so radically in a moment's time in a moment in the presence of Christ we can actually become something completely different than what we were born to be or what it seemed like like our life was headed towards or what it was that we had we had happened to us in our past we can be more than that right that's what the gospel teaches us and sometimes we don't even realize that we're being manipulated by memes manipulated by cute pictures to tell us that we're a certain way or or we have a certain problem and we don't realize that there's there's a scripture that we can look to there's a Bible there's a word of God that we can look at and it tells you're more than conquerors to him that loved you so we don't want to believe what has been set up for us under Satan's Eden under his under his economy under his reign as it would be we want to believe the word amen do we believe that the word is right how many believe the Bible is the inherent word of God it's it's absolutely the word of God it it's infallible it comes to us and God has protected it and so we can look at the Bible and see that we are the victors in this life we are the people that God has called to overcome and and you realize then that if he knows us and he knows about us and he knows all about our life that we cannot be a victim we must be a Victor now uh we we realize that Abraham was just out there one day he was in the in his father's God shop brother brand said he was making idols and he he's just he's just knocking around like any body else would just just conducting himself like anybody else but one day God spoke to Abraham he was just one of millions of people in that time one of millions of people in that Civilization but God spoke to him one day and he said Abraham I want you to move from the place where you're at to another place I want you to be something different I want you to become a father of Nations I know you can't you haven't been able to give birth with Sarah but I'm going to make you a father of Nations and Abraham believed God and was imputed to him for righteousness a moment that he heard from God changed his life forever and his Circumstances had nothing to do with it whether he had money or not had nothing to do with it it was all about what God said that's right he heard the word of the Lord and he believed it and it changed it forever oh church if we could only believe it tonight we have heard the word of the lord we have thus sayith the Lord if we could only believe it and grab a hold of it Moses was uh was born in slavery but but God so ordained his life and controlled his life until he he was when when they sent him down the river uh to be eaten Maybe by crocodiles or lost in the river he was actually saved by Pharaoh's daughter and he become a king like in Pharaoh's house next to pharaoh and he actually delivered the people of Israel what was it God had ordained something over his life and God has ordained something over our life today Rahab you signed in the uh in Jericho Rahab was a woman that had nothing going for her her parents had turned her out on the street and she was a woman who' had been used by men abused by men taken and and she she she she earned her money in the worst kind of a way but when the spies came by her house oh it wasn't no accident that they came by rahab's house but she was predestined to hear it and to believe it and because she happened to be the one that was standing there that day when they come by her house and she said I believe whatever God tells you he'll do it amen oh I I think we ought to be like Rahab tonight not look at our circumstances but look at the promise amen they said if you'll hang this scarlet cord out the window you'll be okay and I'm just going through some of these to show us what a difference it can make when we hear from the word of the Lord when we believe it Mary Magdalene was a woman with Seven Devils she had Seven Devils on her and and and she was a woman that brother Brown said she had devils of Pride and and all those different devils that she had and yet she was a woman that met Jesus and out of her was the Seven Devils were cast and she become a follower of Jesus the woman at the well was a woman that had done everything wrong the woman who washed Jesus feet another woman think of the number of prostitutes that Jesus come by their way because they were ordained to life right and there was there was no e it made no economic sense it made no cultural sense it made no sense that they would ever be different than what their family was but they were different anyway because God said so they were ordained to life a representation in heaven I think of Legion Legion out of whom or he was so full of devils and out of his mind and they cut himself and he and he and he actually was so angry and so mean that no one could bear him be around him he dwelt among the tombs naked and when Jesus spoke to those demons spoke them out of his life they found him sitting at the feet of Jesus in his right mind clothed amen he had no reason to be there but the grace of God Jesus had a need to go by the place where he was Paul was persecuting Christians he was headed just as hard as he could against God trying to do everything he could against God and he was persecuting Christians and one day he's on his way to Damascus to do more persecuting and God knocked him off of his high horse right in the middle of the road and turned him around made him an apostle to the Gentiles right think of brother brandom I went and did a a little genology the other day on brother Brandon's family that's an interesting study bunch of bootleggers and and uh people that you know you wouldn't be necessarily proud of and parts of his family like everybody else El you have the good and the bad brother brandom's family his father there it was in Jeffersonville paper I can show you the clipping of it where his father became a was put in jail when he was young and how that he had to provide for his his siblings because he was the oldest and they had they had to go on welfare parents were on welfare because his father was in jail and they had no money beside what they got from him selling Moonshine Whiskey God made a profit out of a boy raised in that kind of a home I don't want to stop just there I I want to tell you I want to testify to you tonight that God can do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ask or thing I'm going to testify to you that I've been poor I've been homeless I've been I've not had any AD DI to my name but I know God lifted me up and if he Lifted Me Up he can lift you up tonight I was born in sin like you were without hope so you and I could say that we are not victims we are Victors over these circumstances of life I want you to understand what God does and how he works in your life and in my life and I we just want to take a deep dive into it and how does God deal with the individual the Bible tells us that whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world that's just a fact that's the word of God he said believe it was the infallible word of God and so you might say brother Ben well I can't overcome this or I can't overcome that but he said whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world that that encompasses all of it he overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so when we believe we can't do it we can't but if we ever could believe that we can do it then we can why because the victory that overcomes the world faith is the victory Victory amen you believe that tonight so I want us to see again what the infallible inherent word of God says about you and I want us to take it real personal come on now good I don't want us to put it over on the preacher or put it over on somebody else but you've got to believe the message you've got to be born again you've got to you your children young people all of us we've got to be ourselves we've got to manifest the word if somebody's going in a Rapture it's going to be me if somebody's going to overcome it's going to be me it's one thing to come to church and sympathize with the message and sympathize with what's being said and even enjoy the fellowship but it's another thing to say that's for me I'm the eagle that he's crying to I'm the one that heard the word of God for my day right and you might sit for years and and sit around and think well I I just you know it's never been for me I just I just kind of go along with it but one day a light strikes on the inside of your soul and you realize it is for me it is mine so I want us to think about ourselves as individuals the brand said Christ never sent me to build organization but he sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse oh don't I want our church to be a Powerhouse but that's not what he said he said that they might be the PowerHouse you as individuals could be the PowerHouse and the Dwelling Place of the Spirit by his word and I want to present to you tonight as we're kind of just backing this up and laying the groundwork for something we want to say maybe over a few services but I want to present to you tonight that you've heard all the psychology yeah come on you've heard your parents you've heard your friends you've heard from Facebook you've heard from all the social media sites now hear from God it's about time to hear from God what does God say that you are does he say that you're lost and and and and and and you're unlucky and and you're a victim or does he say that you're his child and he loves you and he's going to take care of you and he's going to do what he promised come on now you've heard from everybody else now hear from God look what he told Jeremiah and Jeremiah the prophet in Jeremiah 1: 15 he said before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee oh aren't you glad for a God that knew you sir before thou comest forth out of the womb I sanctify thee and I ordain thee a prophit unto the Nations so it tells us that God allows or limits can even limit what we might get into in the future because he said before I I set you apart and Sanctified you when you were in your mother's womb now we know that he is God and you say well Jeremiah was a prophet but God's forn knowledge is not limited to prophets I want us to turn to Psalms 139 and we've dealt with this before but it's been some time and so I want to look at this chapter of Psalms 139 we'll take several verses look what Look What the Lord says about you again I want this to be real personal to you tonight I don't want you looking around at somebody else I don't want you pitchforking at somebody else I want you to look at you yes sir this is for you he said behold I see you the message Elijah the prophet amen behold I come he's coming back for you amen not for a group but he's coming back for an individual that loves him amen right and so this is what he thinks about you and what he knows about you and and David said oh Lord thou has searched me and known me look how personal it is and also it's past tense you have known me yes sir you have searched me amen he already has he he's not you're not waiting on him to do this this is what the word says he already has done you have searched me you have known me verse two thou knowest my Downs sitting and my Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways that a far off by the way is not distance but time you understand my thought before I think it you you Compass my path and my lying down you are acquainted with all someone say all all my ways so David gives a picture he said you surround me you you've laid Siege to my life like an army would around a city he said you've laid seege to my life you're on you're on this side you're on that side you're on the other side and so you when you think well I've been struck by lightning seven times I've had a real unlucky life but remember whatever's happened in your life it had to go through a Siege of God that was around you his Providence was around you on every side you said when does this start well we're going to find out in just a moment he said you are you you compasses my path in other words you surround me there's no getting away oh my there there's no uh there's no uh falling in between the cracks there's no getting lost but you surround me sir you lay seeds to my path of Life verse four for there is not a word in my tongue but L Lord thou knowest it all together what that is is he said be before I can frame a word on the tip of my tongue the Lord is already thoroughly familiar with what I have to say oh my it to we ought to complain less and thank him more he said before Oh My before you ever made your comp before you ever said the word he already knew who you were what you were and what you were about to say that's so wonderful to me brother Allan because you know you speak by inspiration I have notes that I use and quotes and scriptures but you speak by inspiration a lot of times I don't know what I'm about to say till I say it but he already knew can you think of an intelligence like that I don't even know what I'm about to say I'm just preaching under inspiration but he already knew what I was going to say before I ever said it amen he was thoroughly familiar with my words thou H has beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me so he said I'm in the path of life you surrounded you me you besieged me and you beset me behind and before so there's nowhere to run and then you put your hand on my shoulder you arrested me I want us to think because I know right now you might be feeling well you know well I brother Ben I life's pretty bad right now I don't have much money I don't know what we're going to do I don't know what's going to happen next but these truths do not change based on where you're at in the path right whether you're beginning whether you're in the middle whether you're at the end he said even down to your old age I will keep you listen it doesn't matter what part of the path you're on he said I have arrested you I put my hand on your shoulder hallelujah thank you Jonah I appreciate the support he put He put my his hand on my shoulder aren't you glad to be arrested by God right you said but I haven't been arrested by God what are you doing here well my parents were believe the message and so I believe the message why did your parents believe the message at some point somebody had to come across the message at some point somebody had to believe on Christ at some point somebody had to do that whether it was your generation or in a previous generation somebody had to do that and so you're being here is not an accident at all you're being in your seat tonight in this in the seats you're sitting in in the church you're sitting in hearing the preaching that you're hearing listening to the reading the Bible that you're reading that is not an accident at all that's because he said you have arrested me I am under your control and David he can't hardly handle it as I think maybe we can't hardly handle it today the the thought is too big for our brains the the concept of deity by the D is too big for us it's too much for us to understand oh but I'm so glad I can believe it anyway I don't understand how that all that God was came down but the B talked about how God was existed up in the heaven he said he filled all time and space and when Adam and Eve walked out of the garden and that that that Bloody that bloody skin knocked up against her legs he said that there was actually he said God condensed himself down and come down into a pillar of fire and watched them walk out of the garden I don't understand how God could make himself a germ in the womb of a of a of a mother of of of a little 15-year-old maybe 16year old girl that Mary as she was there a little virgin girl I don't understand how he did it but I know he did it I know he did it such knowledge is too wonderful for me it's high I can un attain unto it he said whe shall I go from thy Spirit whether shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven you're there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there yes if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me and I sit there thinking I I I'm doing this all by myself and you're really not right you sit there thinking that you got it all in control and you really don't you sit there thinking that you're the one that messed up your life and you really weren't think about it for a minute God had to allow it for some purpose and I don't make me want to go out and just make a mess of my life makes me want to love him all that much more look at Jonah and I don't have time to get into it tonight but we've talked about it before we went through the Book of Jonah here a couple years ago Jonah's sitting there in a Well's belly he don't realize what's going on he he doesn't even have an inkling of a clue what's happening in his life but God is moving mountains moving kingdoms God is doing things Beyond Jonah's understanding because Jonah would have never went to Nineveh and he went the opposite direction but he had to go the opposite direction he was just playing into God's plans by going the opposite direction and brother B said the Jonah be by taking the permissive will of God he actually made the perfect will of God more perfect I don't even understand that but it's still true that God knew he would do it and so God caused him to be spit out by a way so he could go tell a story to Nineveh and so the ninevites would hear it and Believe come on because the ninevites had to believe cuz they had to capture Israel again they would raid Israel again they would capture Samaria and the Samaritans would be there there had to be a woman at the well don't you understand what God was doing there had to be a woman at the well and there would have never been if Jonah hadn't preached to Nineveh right good very good we went through that in the scriptures sir we don't even comprehend that Jonah never knew it yeah you imagine what that conversation's like in heaven if she understands that and I guess she probably does the reason I existed is because you went and you didn't want to go and you went the wrong direction but I want you to know Jonah that everything was in God's plan all the time amen I want you to know that it was okay I want you to know that because you because you went to Tarsus instead of going to Nineveh God made it work out so I could be born in Samaria there's a direct link now look said if I Ascend into heaven you're there if I if I make my bed in hell you're there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light around me yeah ye the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou H has possessed my Reigns Reigns in the Bible if you go look in the scriptures Reigns is is the the seat of your emotion it's your heart it's it's what makes you do what you do right right you don't understand why you are what you are and why you do what you do and maybe we'll get into it more on Sunday you don't understand but it's a lot of its genetics right yeah so Reigns in the Bible is like genetics it's your it's your motivation it's why you do what you do unconsciously why you look how you look and the Bible says you have possessed my Reigns in other words you you possessed my DNA yeah and made it the way you wanted it now look what he says it's so precious thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb thou H has covered me in my mother's womb so in other words he said you protected me personally before I was born now you think about that and you look back and say well brother Ben my life my life's been messed up and I understand I'm not trying to minimize the damage that's been done in your life I'm not trying to minimize the things that are going on with you right now and I say that to all of you and to each of you because every one of us deals with things that we would rather not deal with and we'd rather not talk about and every one of us has things going on and we think well what does this have to do with me but remember that before when we were in our mother's womb don't you know if he covered you there that he's covering you today he got a hold of your reins today if he actually took interest in your DNA to make you what you are today what more how much more is he taking interest in you today as a son or daughter of God that's manifesting the word yeah that's good amen you protected me personally before I was born he said I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made notice he he doesn't say I I was I was an accident I'm made I'm not an accident I'm created I'm not a mistake amen I I I I am a masterpiece yes sir if you go look at what brother Bram taught us and identified masterpieces of God you'll find Not only was Christ his Masterpiece but the bride is as well listen Psalms 139:15 my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth when I was made notice the language it's intentional it's not like you know while my parents got together and maybe you don't even know your parents and I'm so glad the blood of Jesus covers all of that today you we don't live under the law sir some sir I don't want to say the word that comes to mind but some uh stupid people I guess I'll say it think the blood of Jesus Christ couldn't cover the wrong kind of a birth brother brand said that was the way it was that back then that they couldn't come in the in the house of the Lord for so many generations but now the blood of Jesus Christ covers that and we know he oh my look God knew that was going to happen you said well it was just an accident it was just even a the product of something terrible but yet God knew it that's why we don't ever life is precious we don't ever do away with life life is is difficult to get here in the first place we definitely don't want to get rid of it I look Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect in thy book all my members were written amen I love in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashion when as yet there was none of them so when it was just a cell when it was just barely conceived said you already had what I would look like written in your book before it even became that verse 17 how precious also are thy thoughts so now David's going back even further he's taking us back until we were just a just a gleam in our father's eye just just a a seed in the womb of our mother he's taking us all the way back there and then he takes us farther back he said how precious are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum sir of them yes sir see he's gone back way farther into God's mind which is eternal he said if I should count them they're more in number than the sand when I I awake I'm still with thee see he didn't start protecting you when you were conceived do we believe the word tonight do we do we really believe this can we can we make it personal can we say this is me this is what God did for me cuz that's what he said he did for you I don't want to call him a liar this is what he did for me this is what he did for you this is how he builds you yeah right the individual you were not just a protected in your mother's womb but you were a protected thought from eternity right God had lots of thoughts CU he knew everything that would happen but you were a protected thought yes sir see he told Israel he said I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil you are a protected you were a protected thought and are a protected thought in the mind of God yes look at Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as Heath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated someone say predestinated he has predestinated us unto the adoption of children now that's where I want to take you is I want us to go through this process and see how he builds us up to the adoption of children but you you got to go back to the beginning you got to find out who you were to understand who you are you got to have a revelation of who you were to know who you are so here we were in the thoughts of God he has chosen us with him within him within himself that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love he has predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of of his will I want you to I want you to understand tonight that you don't want to give up you can't give up why because there's something inside of you that recognizes you're going to be a full-blown son or daughter of God one day you young men sitting on the front you're going to be and what I mean by that is you're going to be able to manifest the word and overcome the challenges that face you in life you're going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going to be you're going to you're going to manifest the word why because he said you would yes you said but I made a mistake well you knew that too right yes sir I just want us to thoroughly understand this we don't want we don't need to be shaky in these times the Bible says everything that can be shaken will be shaken and you sure don't need to be living on the whims of a pastor or living on the whims of an evangelist or living on the whims of today I feel good and tomorrow I feel bad right come on now right you realize and I'm just being open with you and honest tonight you realize when our worship changes based on our circumstances of life right that actually and I know it does even for myself like a something's going on but but but I I I always want to come back to the house of God and have the same kind of worship towards God no matter what's going on right but it does it does affect us but why does it affect us because we don't really understand who we are in God because we we we ought to be unshakable our worship should not change because in fact look look is he less worthy today than he was when you worshiped him before is he Le oh God is he less worthy then when you got saved is he less worth no he's not any less worthy he's the same God today as he is in a meeting he's the same God tonight as he was when you got saved sir but you don't understand what I'm going through you need to understand understand less about what you're going through you really do quit dwelling on it and praise God yes sir CU you can't change it anyway I told Joel that I've come to a place in my life where uh what I want to do what I want to know about a situation is what I can change about it right and if I can't change anything about it there's no point in dwelling on it right and so what are we going to do we've got to get to a place where we realize that God you're in control of these things there's so many things I can't what I can do I will do what I I'll go to church I'll serve God I'll do my best but I can't make my my kids Christians I can't make my these young people I can't do that but I know he can I know he called them before the foundational world and I believe it by the same faith it took me to be saved I believe my children can be saved but I can't make it happen but you change things you can change you're trying to make you you're you're trying to change big stuff and there's little stuff you could change it gets left undone while you're trying to change the world right and we spend so much time on Fox news or CNN or whatever your preferred uh uh whatever your Preferred channel from hell is right I that's what it is is it's a news speed From Hell from Satan's Eden that's what it is right but here we have a news feed from Heaven that says that I'm the economy is going down the that news feed says everything's going to Pieces but this news says I'm a Child of God I'm a son of a of a king I'm going to make it amen I'm going to live in that City one day I'm going to be there one day that's Lord so he says he has made us accepted in the Beloved in verse six and it says we've obtained an inheritance in him in verse verse 11 being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things someone say all things after the counsel of his own will and we know that all things all things work together for good it doesn't say all things are good but all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for and we got to read the rest of it for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son he did not predestinate you to be uh uh as brother as brother Andrew says a helpless hopeless kind of person he predestinated you to be a child of God right he predestinated you to live he predestinated you to adoption and you say but brother Ben I'm afraid that if I try to live the message that my family will be all messed up and everything no you just believe the word live the word God will take care of the rest of it good now look so now look look what Paul says look at the reasoning that he uses and it's so it's such Common Sense moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called them he justified whom he justified them he also glorified why because they were predestinated they were called because they were predestinated they were Justified because they were predestinated they were glorified because they were predestinated verse 31 what shall we then say to these things other words what should our attitude be towards these things if God be for us who can be against us that's good not who will be because many will be but who can be amen many will be but who can be see this is your beginning this is where he started building you yeah this is the real you and I want to know the real me come on I don't want to be stuck in my past I don't want to be worried about my future I want to know the real me I want to know there's something Beyond brother Mark this old flesh that fails and and does everything that wrong that it could do if you just in life every day brother B said we we sin every day because we we fail to do things we should do the sins of omission we sin every day we do things maybe we say something or do something that's wrong but yet he loves us anyway I want to know who I really am I don't want to know I know this body of Flesh got to be dissolved I want to know who's the real me and he tells us in his word if God before us who can be against this brother Brandon says it this way did you know that you're being here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by God so it wasn't just God thought about you in in a in a can't use too big of a word for [Music] Joel I'm searching for a smaller word it's not that he thought about you like in a free market capitalistic way like like he just let things go there's a word for that but I won't use it because I'm afraid I'll pronounce it wrong he just let it go you know no it's it's pre-planned right right it's pre-planned the Our God's economy is not a an Economy based like ours is and should be on capitalism but it's actually based on planning it is a planned economy that actually works now planned economy don't work for us and the reason they don't work is because we can't control things right they may have the best intentions but they can't control the outcomes and you've all heard of Chaos Theory where a where a butterfly flapping its wings in South America can cause a typhoon in Asia somewhere and and and and they've proven that just a little atmospheric change can cause such a difference everything you do makes a difference in the world around you and so you can't predict even the weather very far out why they give you a 5-day forecast and it ain't very ACC accurate and so you you can't predict what's going to happen down the road but I'm telling you we serve a God who knows not every not just the big things but every little thing listen brother brand said the infinite God knowed and to be infinite he had to know every flee right think about it for a minute he knew every flea that ever would be in the earth there's probably been a billion fleas bite your dog if you have one think about it for a minute there's been I know there has been our dog he has to take a pill because of fleas I don't know how that works he takes a pill because he's allergic to fleas it's pretty bad to be a dog that's allergic to flee just he's just worthless he's allergic to fleas but God knows everyone that ever B him along with all the other 400 million dogs on our block God knows sir amen oh do we believe that tonight he knows he knows every flea that would ever be in the Earth how many times it would bat its eye all right he said that's infinite our little Minds cannot fathom what infinite means the infinite God he knew all things therefore there is nothing someone say nothing there is nothing out of cater nothing out of you said but my situation right now is out of cater do we believe the word or do we not there is nothing out of cater we may think it's out of cater we may be sitting in a whales belly and every which way we look is whales belly but Jonah said I'm going to worship you I'm going to turn my face toward the temple I'm going to cry out to God because I believe he's a god of Miracles I believe he's a God that can change my situation you may have symptoms all over the place but you're not in the whale's belly but even if you were you could believe God would bring you out I think Jonah realized that the very God that kept him alive as long as he had been alive in the whales belly could get him out of the whales belly and I guess you need to realize at some point in your life that the very God that's kept you alive to this point is going to get you out of here right oh church that ought to give us comfort and strength tonight to know we're going somewhere nothing out of cater sir brother BR said now we're a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute read in God you were only in his thinking your very name that ever ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were he said I'm saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are he said you are not going to be but now you're the sons of God you always were the sons of God for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there he said when he before he even became material here on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knew what your name would be you ever not like your name he knew what it would be he knew the color of hair you would have we may have never seen it in its natural color but he knows it right and you think about that and I'm seriously though I know I'm not preaching about hair coloring but think about it for a minute he knows the color of your hair it means he meant for you to be what you are that ought to give us great peace I know I'm taking it slow tonight but I hope we understand it that ought to give us great peace not knocking you for coloring your hair I'd color mine there's not enough left to color it but he knew what color he's got mine counted that's a project right there wonder how many angels he's got assigned to that one he could do it all himself he knew he knew all about you all right no matter how well you know a person you don't know everything right you don't know everything about the person you're married to you may have been married for 50 years and still you might get surprised sometime you don't know everything because there maybe there was things they forgot they went through before they met you that you don't even know about them oh my but he knows yes he said the only thing happened he said is when you being a sinner he said many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or little girl you'd walk around there would be certain things that would just wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there something you that cried out see and and what what the devil's doing now is he's labeling us different and we were different it's called The Seed of God but the devil wants to label us as something else try to make us give us some disease or something and some mental condition put us off over in a box somewhere don't let the devil provide the labels you're a seed of God he said it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly he said now what was that there was that little form of life in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day amen we could say today maybe you went from Camp to Camp from meeting to meeting from church to church but one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you see why we preached the word because there just might be somebody sitting here tonight it's your time to hear the word for the first time to wake up that seed on the inside that your journey can begin at least the part you know about good one day you're being part of God you had to be the word when you heard the word you knew where it came from you knew that that you you you knew that what was the truth he said you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it amen he told his Eagle Story how this the little eagle and I'm letting you go in just a few minutes you forgive me tonight but brother Joel gave me a little extra time so I got just a few minutes but that eagle story you remember brother bam told it how that the eagle was out was hunting its chick and they knew had laid another egg and here was a his chick had been put with a with a hen and here the hen the chicken is with the H being taught how to scratch like a hen how to click like a hen how to act like a hen but as it grew the more it grew the less hin like it was and the less it fit in around the hin and one day just at the right time aren't you glad that God rescued you at the right time I believe there's hope for our children There's Hope for our your lost loved ones there's hope for other people because you know that you were you weren't always tuned towards God but yet there was something there but one day you heard the scream of an eagle and it reminded you of something you'd heard that before you didn't remember because you were an egg form you were in thought form when you heard that word before but now you're hearing it again you realize you was in a thought in God's mind you're going to have to forgive me tonight you were a thought in God's mind when he spoke let there be light that was a thought too and that thought was there think about it you you oh my we can say it this way I know I know it's not because you you're a thought you didn't understand it but it's like it's as if you heard the word of God you had heard it before and when you heard this message you didn't hear the voice of a man but you heard the same voice glory to God yes sir boo devil you heard the same word you heard it's a thought good think about that for a minute how you know you think I'm crazy look God by his for knowledge knew all things he said there's that word flashes out there he said that that's the way it is with every Born Again believer that word flashes out and there's something takes a hold you come to it he said you were once dead in sin life as as he quickened he said we were predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God you who are once dead in sin and trespasses he said wherein we all had our times pass but hath he quickened he said look at Paul when Paul was a great Theologian when he come face to face with that word Jesus it quickened he come to life right quick because he was ordained to be that Paul talks about how his lifestyle I have don't have time to read it tonight in Galatians chapter 1 you can read it starting in verse 14 but he says this how that he was exceedingly zealous of the traditions of his fathers he said but when it pleased God Amen when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb you said but I've been in the message for years I've been around a message church for years but when it pleased God Paul heard about the gospel but he had never met Christ he had heard the gospel and he said this he did what he did in ignorance because he'd never that seed had never been awakened but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me he said I didn't confer among Flesh and Blood he said I went up to Jerusalem to them which were I didn't go up to Jerusalem but I went into Arabia and returned again into Damascus what was it the word heard the word and when he come back he was preaching the same word though he'd never been taught it he was part of the word when the word saw the word it was his nature he said all the clucking of the hens and the Orthodox Churches didn't have no effect on him he had seen the word it was part of him he was an eagle he wasn't a chicken he was just in the barnyard with them but he was an eagle to begin with brother Brandon tells a story about the duck and I preached a message on it here a while back you remember it was can you smell the water can you smell the water he said the duck was out there with the hens and it was just it was just clicking around with the hens doing whatever the hens do do and uh and it was just clucking with the hin and when it did that it was just it was just out there he said but one day it got out around back of the Barnyard and it caught a whiff the wind turned in the right direction and it caught a sin of water he said it went straight for the pond as fast as it could go why it was born to be in water there was something inside of it that made it want the water more than anything else oh church that's the way you come to God that's the way he built you there's something inside of you even though maybe in your mind you're thinking well I'm bored I shouldn't be here but there's something inside of you that is smelled the water and if you can smell the water you can be saved right good look I don't have time to get the rest this Sunday look R said you become part of God we were we were unbelievers right we did everything an adult can do everything a kid could do if you're saved as a child we did we did it all for the equivalent and Paul says such were some of you but you're washed you're Sanctified but you know sometimes we get complexes in our minds and we think well I'm just not good enough I done too much and I've never really had that smell the water moment heard that eagle scream because I just heard it in church devil will beat you up about that look what brother brandom tells a woman named sister Bruce that got in that same condition are you still with me tonight I got maybe five more minutes brother brandom says sister Bruce says but I've never had had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on and he responds this way he said all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce said yes that was your nature it changed once what changed it Christ there you are sister that's how he builds you you you used to be a sinner and I fellowship with some of you about that but you changed what was it you said what happened for me down at an altar and I cried and spoke in tongues that's wonderful I believe God does that that way for a reason but for others maybe they don't necessarily have that same type of experience but yet they still have been changed look and you someone say you someone say me you happy Quicken me hath he quickened can you say that who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walk according to the course of this world but God Ephesians 2:4 who is rich in Mercy for his great love where with he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ has raised us up that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace from his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus brother brandom talked to a man who had been gone from church to church looking for something one day he'd been a car dealer and there ain't much forgiveness for that he was on the car lot and someone left a give him a card said where will you spend an eternity and made him think so he starts looking he goes to the Baptist Church the Methodist Church Pentecostal church and he just never felt like he had it and he said went to Brother Bram Pentecostal told him well go to brother Bram he's a prophet he can discern your life and tell you what you need to do I love the way brother Bram discerned his life he he he come to me said what do I need to do brother brother random he said not a thing hey man he said nothing you can do I said you told me for the first 40 Years of your life you didn't care about God but you picked up a little piece of paper and said where will you spend eternity and something said that's got to be settled you couldn't get over it he said now you were going down the road this way all at once you started back this way you didn't care for God you started back hunting for him oh my I remember what that was like he said you started back cutting him I said right there where you made your turn where you made your turn do you remember what the turn was like where you made your turn right there where you made your turn that's exactly what changed you right there he said then I've had it all the time I said certainly glory to God he said well praise be to God he said it never started on any day listen it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved Jesus just come to redeem that but you was saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with do you believe it tonight musicians go ahead and come I want to close with this how many of you have ever counted steps got a wrist watch I did that for a while and the kids stole my watch disconnected it from my phone now it's missing but the thing lied anyway I walk more than that think said I was lazy if you count steps you know what I'm about to say see you do that for fitness and you know you can you know you can cheat maybe I shouldn't tell you that depends on what you're wearing I guess how high takech your equipment is but you can cheat on that right it you know you can kind of you get to a place where you can shake it or put it in your pocket you know do something with it I I some of y'all done that hav you did you realize God counts your steps you know that job said that he said does he not see my ways and count all my steps that little thing you wear on your arm that watch could be wrong but he's never been wrong he counts your steps and he doesn't do it to be judgmental and wake up in the morning say you didn't get enough steps yesterday he counts your steps because he cares about you and he knows how many steps it takes to get you from here to there he he do right when Enoch W when Enoch walked with God this came to me today and it just just blessed me when Enoch walked with God God knew exactly how many steps it would take Enoch from the moment he's started walking with God until the end of his life and he walked home he wasn't guessing Enoch didn't know he had no clue but God did can I tell you tonight God knows your steps he sees your steps and I see people get so out of sorts and upset and and you don't realize we go everybody goes through stuff what's the difference between a steady Christian who's grounded on the word it's not that they never go through anything but the Danny but it's because they know that they have a rock they know there's something that that has a hold of their life they know that there's something and I'm going to praise God anyway I'm going to worship him anyway I'm going to live for him anyway no matter what happens in my life God is building me he is taking care of me he's counting my steps how he's building you the individual began his thoughts will you believe that tonight you are not a victim but he counts your steps you are a Victor greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world would you stand with me tonight and bow your [Music] heads maybe maybe we just need to thank all of us I want to ask for a show of hands we just all need to think we just don't give God enough credit it counts my steps he knew how many steps I would take today why I would be this way and who I am all of my character flaws everything about me he knew and he let me be the way I am for a reason Lord help me to be content in the state that I'm in and to know that it's not the end he knows how many steps between now and the Rapture how many steps between now and your between right now and your healing he knows how many steps between right now when your kids come home he knows how many steps when your children receive the Holy Ghost he knows let's just let him handle it can we can we do that tonight just let him handle it if you just pray and ask him Lord Lord take control of my life I I surrender to you Lord I know you have I know you're you you surround me anyway you've laid seeds to my life Lord I'm just surrendering to you letting you be who you are letting you do what you do life would be so much easier that way Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be in your presence tonight and I'm so thankful for these people that have set patiently hear the word Lord though Lord I'm not a great preacher but Lord I know that your word is great Lord if I could only get across the people what I understand myself and what I've understood this week that Lord that you are in control of every part of my life even down to the DNA that created it even down to my father my grandfather my great-grandfather all the way back lord you controlled and manipulated time and everything else to get me where I'm at today Lord then let me let me believe you for the little things oh God let me believe you let me let me
