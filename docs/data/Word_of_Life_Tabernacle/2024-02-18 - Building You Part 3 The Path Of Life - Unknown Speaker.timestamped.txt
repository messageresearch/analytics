[48:38] Pleasures forever more I want to
[48:40] continue speaking this morning on
[48:42] building the individual building you
[48:45] going talk this morning about the path
[48:46] of life you may be
[48:54] seated there's a passage in the book
[48:57] Pilgrims Progress where Pilgrim is uh
[49:01] continuing on his journey and there's a
[49:05] uh two companions with him mistrust and
[49:08] timorous and as they are going ahead of
[49:12] him he sees them running back just as
[49:14] hard as they can go and in seeing that
[49:17] he he realizes there must be a danger
[49:20] ahead so he begins to look carefully and
[49:23] as he looks he sees two lions by the
[49:26] road and he says well that must be why
[49:28] that they're returning with such haste
[49:31] and and he began to be afraid and and he
[49:35] thought well maybe I need to turn back
[49:37] maybe I need to run at this time because
[49:39] there's lions in the way he thought
[49:42] nothing but death was before him but
[49:44] there was a porter at the lodge that uh
[49:47] of the town that the uh Road was going
[49:50] to and his name was watchful and
[49:53] watchful uh saw that Christian was about
[49:56] to make a halt and and he cried out to
[49:59] him and he said is thy strength so small
[50:02] fear not the Lions for they are
[50:05] chained fear not the Lions for they are
[50:08] chained and are placed there for a trial
[50:11] of Faith where it is and for discovery
[50:14] of those who have none he said keep in
[50:18] the midst of the path and no hurt shall
[50:21] come unto thee and as he begin to get
[50:23] closer and he begin to take to the
[50:26] directions of the porter he heard the
[50:28] Lion's Roar but they did him no harm
[50:31] because they were actually chained to
[50:33] the side to the gate they were unable to
[50:36] get in the middle of the road and I want
[50:38] to to tell you and as we begun this
[50:40] series of of sermons on the individual
[50:42] and how God deals with the individual I
[50:45] want you to understand that the Lions
[50:47] have been chained the the the the
[50:49] Troubles of Life the struggles the
[50:52] things that you look at and say well
[50:53] I'll never be able to overcome that I'll
[50:55] never be able to meet that challenge and
[50:57] you recognize the lions are chained you
[50:59] just got to stay in the word don't go
[51:02] outside the word do what the word says
[51:05] do stay in the word don't trust emotion
[51:07] don't trust sensation don't trust what
[51:10] the world says about it don't even trust
[51:12] what your neighbor says about it or your
[51:14] friend or your family member you trust
[51:16] the word of God because there's a porter
[51:18] crying out stay in the middle of the
[51:20] road I believe we had one in this age I
[51:23] believe we had a prophet who spoke out
[51:25] and he said stay in the middle of the
[51:26] road I want to Echo that this morning
[51:28] brother Stuart I want to say stay in the
[51:29] middle of the road the Lions cannot get
[51:32] you as long as you stay in the middle of
[51:34] the word yes
[51:35] sir yes amen so we find that our path is
[51:41] surrounded it's surrounded We Know by
[51:43] enemies but but David said my path is
[51:46] surrounded by you Lord he said you you
[51:49] you've encompassed my path you're you
[51:51] beset me behind and before and we read
[51:53] last week and the week before where he
[51:55] said if I make my bed in hell you're
[51:57] there if I fly with the wings of the
[51:59] morning you're there wherever I am in my
[52:01] life you're there that ought to make us
[52:02] excited this morning it ought to do
[52:04] something brother Kevin and our hearts
[52:05] to know that he's with us no matter what
[52:07] we're going through in life he was with
[52:09] you he he saw you he knew you before you
[52:11] ever knew him before you ever wanted him
[52:14] he already knew what you would
[52:17] be and so we found that our path is
[52:20] arrested by his grace I'm so glad for
[52:23] that today from beginning to end we're
[52:27] all swallowed up by
[52:29] Providence right we we found that the
[52:32] system is rigged yeah all right right
[52:35] not against us but for
[52:39] us sir come on I wish I could get that
[52:42] through to you this morning the system
[52:44] is rigged but it's not rigged against
[52:47] you it's rigged for
[52:50] you and if you'll just stay with the
[52:52] word you'll find in your life that
[52:54] everything happens for your benefit to
[52:57] those who love God those who are the
[52:58] called according to his purpose
[53:00] everything happens for a reason the
[53:02] system is not rigged against you it is
[53:04] not that everybody's out to get you the
[53:06] pastor is not out to get you the church
[53:08] is not out to get you the world's not
[53:10] out to get you in that sense but even
[53:12] your enemies are put there for a purpose
[53:14] and even like David said when the man
[53:16] threw a stone at him when he was leaving
[53:18] Jerusalem and everything seemed to be
[53:19] going wrong and he said maybe the Lord
[53:21] told him to do that if we could only get
[53:23] a revelation of that in our lives we'd
[53:25] understand that it it's not their fault
[53:27] you say but I got enemies I got people
[53:29] that are against me it's not their fault
[53:31] it's not because that they want
[53:32] something bad for you God allowed them
[53:34] to do that for a reason it's to bring
[53:36] you to a place where you ought to be in
[53:38] him yes the system is rigged for you all
[53:44] right oh my oh my you know if you
[53:50] knew I don't believe in playing the
[53:51] lottery so let's just get that out of
[53:53] the way but if you knew right that the
[53:55] system was
[53:57] riged and you went down to play the
[53:59] lottery at the gas station you would you
[54:02] wouldn't mind spending your money but
[54:05] see the problem with the lottery is the
[54:06] system's rigged against
[54:08] you right the system is rigged against
[54:11] you but the system if you think about it
[54:13] the economic system the the path of life
[54:16] that you've been set on is actually
[54:19] rigged in your favor yeah but it's not
[54:22] just rigged and see the reason we can't
[54:23] recognize that is it's not just
[54:25] our in our material favor or in our uh
[54:28] in our favor the way we want it or it's
[54:31] not wishful thinking it's not it's not
[54:34] health wealth and prosperity but it's
[54:36] actually uh rigged in such a way if I
[54:39] could use that word we're talking about
[54:40] the Providence of God the system is
[54:42] actually set up in such a way that
[54:44] actually God allowed this to be Satan's
[54:46] Eden he allowed this to be the time that
[54:48] you lived in he put you here on this
[54:51] Earth at this time for a reason he put
[54:53] you in the church that you're in put you
[54:54] in in the marriage that you're in put
[54:56] you in the situation that you're in put
[54:57] you in the job that you're in you don't
[54:59] even understand that I don't even
[55:01] comprehend that but he did it anyway but
[55:04] it's not always because it's just like
[55:06] if God gives you a job it doesn't mean
[55:07] it'll be easy right that's right if God
[55:10] puts you in a church it doesn't mean
[55:11] things will go easy yeah and things will
[55:13] go smooth it might it might not go
[55:15] smooth it might not but there's got to
[55:17] be some re realization in Your Heart
[55:19] Lord I know you put me here for a reason
[55:22] I know I'm doing this in my life for a
[55:23] reason the sister is rigged for me I'm a
[55:27] son or daughter of God I I I'm bigger if
[55:30] you can say it this way I'm too big to
[55:33] fail amen I'm to you remember back in
[55:35] the financial crisis in 2008 when GM
[55:38] they said what would happen if GM fa the
[55:40] economy will crash so the government
[55:42] just pump money into them because they
[55:43] said they're too big to fail you're too
[55:45] big to fail God's not going to let you
[55:48] fail come on but you don't always
[55:51] understand what success looks like right
[55:54] and so you think success success is
[55:55] getting what you want when actually
[55:57] success might be might be recognizing
[55:59] that the lions are chained but it's
[56:01] going to be tough but you're going to
[56:02] make it if you're going to have to sweat
[56:04] but you're going to make it you're going
[56:05] to it life might be hard but you're
[56:07] going to make it good are you with me so
[56:12] far now you say well I was born and
[56:17] poor maybe I was born jeans as we talked
[56:21] about last week that make me a certain
[56:23] way maybe maybe I'm big or little or
[56:27] ugly or beautiful that can be a curse
[56:30] too for to some
[56:32] people and I was born that way and it's
[56:35] just been my lot in life my my portion
[56:38] in life to be that way and say that
[56:42] that's against me but it's not right
[56:45] it's actually for
[56:47] you it's for you and comprehending that
[56:51] is what will make you settled but the B
[56:53] said it takes away the fear and the
[56:54] scare
[56:55] to know that you're elected by God yes
[56:58] now look what David said in psalm 16
[57:01] we're going to just really dig into this
[57:02] Psalm we believe it's the word of God
[57:04] don't we how many believe the word of
[57:06] God is
[57:07] infallible the word of God is infallible
[57:09] what that means is it can't be wrong
[57:11] right right so it's always going to be
[57:14] right Psalm 16:5 the Lord is the portion
[57:18] of mine inheritance and of my cup he
[57:21] said thou maintain my lot so he's
[57:23] telling us that the Lord is the portion
[57:26] in the Hebrew that that's a a word
[57:27] called meth which is a person's
[57:29] allotment what is given to a person in
[57:31] life he's saying to he's saying the Lord
[57:35] is my portion so uh my portion may not
[57:38] be what others portion are my portion or
[57:40] my cup is those circumstances of Life
[57:43] those things which have conspired to
[57:45] make me who I am those things which have
[57:47] uh genes plus the nature plus the
[57:50] nurture all the things that have come
[57:52] together to make me who I am he said you
[57:54] have actually
[57:55] uh determine that and not only determine
[57:57] that but you are my portion so he's
[57:59] saying even if I'm poorer than somebody
[58:01] else you're my portion even if I don't
[58:03] have uh all the talent that somebody
[58:06] else has you're my portion even if
[58:08] everybody else might get along better in
[58:09] life even if I might have been born with
[58:11] a disability or or some kind of a a
[58:14] disadvantage compared to other people
[58:16] but you're my portion Amen on so there's
[58:19] some reason for it there's something
[58:21] that that you've given me to do and as I
[58:23] think of Fanny Crosby he wrote many
[58:25] songs with Blessed assurance Jesus is
[58:27] mine and what a but she she had a a
[58:30] blindness that happened to her at a
[58:31] young age and and because she was blind
[58:34] they said well uh maybe that maybe maybe
[58:37] God could give you healing and she said
[58:39] if go if I was offered healing today I
[58:40] wouldn't accept it because she
[58:42] understood that uh that there was
[58:44] something about her life that was she
[58:45] was meant to be blind yeah do that makes
[58:49] sense and and you say well that's hard
[58:51] for me to understand and I believe God's
[58:53] A Healer God always wants to heal us
[58:54] don't get me wrong but there are things
[58:56] that are in your life for a reason yes
[58:58] because God glorified himself in her as
[59:01] a blind person in a way that he couldn't
[59:03] have if she had her sight right right
[59:06] and so he said the Lord is my portion
[59:08] you maintain my lot so now he's saying
[59:11] you're sufficient to meet all my needs
[59:13] now we know in the Bible we're taught
[59:15] that the ability to to accept one's
[59:17] portion in life is a gift of God Paul
[59:20] tells us be content in whatever state
[59:22] you find yourself in and it would it
[59:24] would do us a lot of good if we weren't
[59:26] always concerned about what tomorrow and
[59:28] what we're going to be but what is our
[59:29] portion today what has God given us and
[59:31] be content with that and be happy with
[59:33] what God has given us Ecclesiastes 5:18
[59:36] it says behold that which I have seen it
[59:38] is good and comely for one to eat and to
[59:40] drink and to enjoy the good of all his
[59:42] labor that he taketh Under the Sun all
[59:44] the days of his life which God giveth
[59:45] him for it is his portion he said again
[59:49] every man also to whom God ha given
[59:50] riches and wealth and ha given him power
[59:52] to eat thereof and to take his portion
[59:54] to rejoice in his labor this is the gift
[59:56] of God so you find some people are never
[59:59] happy never satisfied even though God's
[1:00:01] given them a good job they've given a
[1:00:03] good family but they're just never happy
[1:00:05] and so they get themselves out of the
[1:00:06] will of God because they're unable to
[1:00:09] really accept what God's done for them
[1:00:11] what that he's given them their portion
[1:00:13] the portion that God gave you might have
[1:00:14] been kids that are healthy and you ought
[1:00:16] to thank God for that because not every
[1:00:18] child is healthy the portion that God
[1:00:20] gave you might be a family that serves
[1:00:22] God you ought to thank God for that he
[1:00:24] said but we don't have much money but
[1:00:25] you ought to thank God anyway because
[1:00:27] God is your
[1:00:29] portion or you might have Financial
[1:00:31] Resources you're looking over these
[1:00:32] other people say well they don't have
[1:00:33] health problems but they but they don't
[1:00:35] have money either right everybody's got
[1:00:38] something everybody's got a portion
[1:00:40] everybody's got a cup they've got a
[1:00:42] drink from oh my let me let me be
[1:00:44] satisfied with the portion God has given
[1:00:47] me that's good so he is my portion and
[1:00:50] David goes on in verse six to say the
[1:00:52] lions are Fallen unto me in Pleasant
[1:00:56] places he said yay I have a goodly
[1:00:59] Heritage I think this way we ought to
[1:01:01] look at
[1:01:02] life a goodly Heritage in other words
[1:01:05] now he's referencing Joshua and and the
[1:01:08] placing of the children of Israel in the
[1:01:10] land lines have fallen to me in other
[1:01:12] words it uh you know everybody got a
[1:01:14] part but my part's good for me yeah
[1:01:18] right everybody got a portion of the
[1:01:19] land but my portion of the land is
[1:01:21] exactly what I needed yeah well I wonder
[1:01:25] how many people could testify this
[1:01:26] morning everybody got something they got
[1:01:28] to do in life everybody's got something
[1:01:30] that some burden that they carry
[1:01:32] everybody's got some issues in their
[1:01:34] life but the things that God has allowed
[1:01:36] me to carry and the things God has
[1:01:37] allowed me to do was good for me yes yes
[1:01:41] but that's hard for me to understand but
[1:01:42] been because the things that I've done
[1:01:43] have been hard but I think we ought to
[1:01:45] pray like and I'm I'm getting away from
[1:01:47] my not this morning but I just feel like
[1:01:49] preaching I feel like you're listening
[1:01:51] and and we I've talked to you before
[1:01:53] about Caleb's daughter you remember
[1:01:55] Caleb's daughter was one who was given a
[1:01:57] Southland in other words she was given a
[1:01:59] part of the ngev desert which was all
[1:02:01] the way in the very south part of the
[1:02:03] land and it was a part had no water on
[1:02:05] it was just desert so she asked for a
[1:02:08] land and she was given a Southland and
[1:02:10] she went to her father and she didn't
[1:02:11] say change the land that you've given me
[1:02:14] but what she told him she come to him
[1:02:16] and she said give me also Springs of
[1:02:18] water give me Springs of water if you've
[1:02:21] given me a South Land If you give me a
[1:02:23] dry land if I've had got a hard lot in
[1:02:25] life let me have your spirit on it let
[1:02:27] me let me be anointed by your spirit let
[1:02:30] me be able to worship you anyway let me
[1:02:32] be able to praise you anyway even though
[1:02:34] my lot in life might be difficult but
[1:02:36] but you love me I know you love me you
[1:02:38] wouldn't have put me there for no reason
[1:02:39] so let me Praise You In The Storm let me
[1:02:42] worship you in the
[1:02:48] desert David I want you to understand
[1:02:51] that David knew this because he wasn't
[1:02:53] he didn't move to bethle
[1:02:56] think about it he was born
[1:03:00] there right he was born he said the
[1:03:03] lines have fallen to
[1:03:05] me excuse me in Pleasant places I want
[1:03:08] us to think spiritually for a moment
[1:03:10] David didn't move to Bethlehem he was
[1:03:13] born there you were born naturally where
[1:03:16] you were for a
[1:03:19] reason brother Bram said like he said
[1:03:22] there's many kinds of Hills like many
[1:03:23] kinds of rivers Springs Lakes he said
[1:03:26] they were here when you come here first
[1:03:28] because the kindness of your heavenly
[1:03:30] father placed them here because some men
[1:03:33] likes mountains some men likes Waters
[1:03:35] some likes deserts I don't know why but
[1:03:37] I guess some do he said so you see
[1:03:40] you're coming he knew your nature and
[1:03:42] what you would be he said so he made it
[1:03:44] just the way that you could enjoy it
[1:03:47] yeah he said oh I think that's a
[1:03:49] wonderful father see he know that he
[1:03:52] made it like this I'm I'm thankful and
[1:03:54] and then you'd say well this is a little
[1:03:55] thing but I'm thankful that God put me
[1:03:57] in the area that he put me in because
[1:03:59] I've lived in different parts of of
[1:04:01] Missouri and Arkansas and even North
[1:04:03] Texas and I've lived in in in places
[1:04:05] that I didn't like and and I do like the
[1:04:08] place where I'm at now but I think God
[1:04:10] has a way of orchestrating that doesn't
[1:04:13] he he has a way of putting you in a
[1:04:15] place that fits you right he's got
[1:04:18] there's something about you that it just
[1:04:20] fits you amen and so you you don't fit
[1:04:23] just anywhere but he made it just the
[1:04:25] way that you could enjoy it he said oh I
[1:04:27] think that's a wonderful father see he
[1:04:30] he know that he made it like this he
[1:04:31] said I'm glad he made mountains I like
[1:04:33] the mountains and he said where others
[1:04:35] say oh I can't stand oh he must have
[1:04:36] emptied his morar box out there he said
[1:04:38] well he emptied it out so I could enjoy
[1:04:40] it you see he says then I didn't say I
[1:04:44] like the PLS where I can see a long way
[1:04:46] well the two different Natures both of
[1:04:47] us Christians i' mentioned my
[1:04:49] grandfather before my grandfather loved
[1:04:51] uh loved the Wide Open Spaces he thought
[1:04:53] syon Missouri was the the pearl of the
[1:04:56] US uh of the US down in there he just
[1:04:59] loveed that bottom land CU Rich farmland
[1:05:01] and I didn't like that I like the hills
[1:05:03] the mountain God made me different for a
[1:05:05] specific purpose and a spe oh Church
[1:05:07] don't you realize he loves you today and
[1:05:09] he made you even naturally to be where
[1:05:11] you were supposed to
[1:05:13] be he said the two different Natures
[1:05:15] both of us Christians but the father
[1:05:17] knew that you would be here and prepared
[1:05:19] everything for you before you got here
[1:05:22] your first coming here he had it ready
[1:05:24] for you when you got here amen oh I love
[1:05:27] that I love maybe you were somewhere
[1:05:29] where it didn't really fit but then
[1:05:30] something happened you said well it was
[1:05:32] just my job it was just this that or the
[1:05:33] other I changed I did this or I moved
[1:05:36] here but then you found yourself in a
[1:05:38] place where you could worship and you
[1:05:39] could praise God what was it it was God
[1:05:42] orchestrating your life yeah he chose
[1:05:45] your path of life and that's why we
[1:05:48] shouldn't always
[1:05:50] look let me just say this we shouldn't
[1:05:52] always choose based on what what's good
[1:05:54] or what appears to be good for us
[1:05:56] because God knows what's good for us
[1:05:59] right right and sometimes what appears
[1:06:01] good right now might not be good
[1:06:02] tomorrow so we don't choose what church
[1:06:04] to go to based on what church is bigger
[1:06:06] or what church is smaller what church
[1:06:08] has this that or the other we choose
[1:06:10] based on Lord where would you want me to
[1:06:12] be where where where can I get my soul
[1:06:14] fed and and so you do that you don't
[1:06:16] choose you don't choose who to marry
[1:06:18] based on uh uh based on some idea of
[1:06:22] perfect this this would be the perfect
[1:06:23] husband but you do it Lord what would
[1:06:25] you have me who would you have me to
[1:06:26] marry what there's a there's a path of
[1:06:28] life there's something God has chosen
[1:06:30] for you and it will never be against the
[1:06:32] word you will not have to break the word
[1:06:34] to do the will of God right you never
[1:06:37] have to so he chose your path of life he
[1:06:40] chose the place and time of your birth
[1:06:42] both naturally and spiritually now
[1:06:45] brother so when the mothers and them
[1:06:47] Hebrew women in labor give an utterance
[1:06:48] to those children being born it placed
[1:06:50] their name it told their birth it put
[1:06:52] them in the Homeland it set set them
[1:06:54] over to Eternity I love that it set them
[1:06:57] all the way over to Eternity he said
[1:06:59] then watch Jacob when he was dying there
[1:07:00] when he laid his hands on the Patriarchs
[1:07:02] and bless them he'd tell them exactly
[1:07:04] where they would be he said and that's
[1:07:05] exactly according to their name exactly
[1:07:07] according to their birth and sure it has
[1:07:09] something to do with you he said no
[1:07:10] that's your birth path he even talked
[1:07:11] about the heavens and the stars and
[1:07:13] different things like that he said
[1:07:14] that's your birth path that's what you
[1:07:16] are a natural man or natural woman he
[1:07:18] said but when you're reborn again he
[1:07:20] said that's not the outside conscience
[1:07:21] the outside is what you see taste feel
[1:07:24] smelling here but the inside of that is
[1:07:26] what you really are right right he said
[1:07:28] now this out here Satan just temps you
[1:07:30] and knocks you around every way here he
[1:07:32] said but down here he can't do it come
[1:07:34] on all right unless you let him do
[1:07:38] it right so now watch he said for in
[1:07:41] here you've got faith and Faith don't
[1:07:43] come from the outer conscience it
[1:07:45] reasons but in faith there's no reason
[1:07:48] he said you've got it from God you know
[1:07:50] it's there I don't care how much it
[1:07:51] looks wrong you still know it's right
[1:07:53] it's just sayth the Lord look we're
[1:07:55] talking about the word we're not talking
[1:07:56] about your emotions your feelings
[1:07:57] anything else but if the word says it
[1:07:59] it's thus sayith the Lord even if it
[1:08:01] looks wrong come on now yes sir it's
[1:08:04] thus sayith the Lord he said there's
[1:08:05] nothing going to bother that nothing can
[1:08:07] bother that it's moving right straight
[1:08:09] on difficulty means nothing to it it
[1:08:12] waits right on through it for it's the
[1:08:13] word yes right
[1:08:17] now where is the place of your spiritual
[1:08:20] birth where were you born now think
[1:08:22] about it you say well I was born in
[1:08:24] born again at Camp I was born again at
[1:08:26] the altar I was born again in Hardy
[1:08:29] that's not what he's asking where is the
[1:08:31] place of your spiritual birth you were
[1:08:33] born in
[1:08:34] Christ good right you were born in
[1:08:37] Christ no matter what Ministry it was no
[1:08:40] matter what time it was no matter what
[1:08:42] uh what was going on what song was being
[1:08:43] sung what what sermon was being preached
[1:08:47] you were born in Christ yes and so the
[1:08:50] place of your spiritual birth is is
[1:08:52] literally the bread of God John 6:35
[1:08:55] Jesus said unto me I am the bread unto
[1:08:57] them I am the bread of life he that
[1:08:58] cometh to me shall never hunger he that
[1:09:00] believeth on me shall never thirst so
[1:09:03] brother BR said if Christ had to become
[1:09:05] the bread of life to be born in
[1:09:06] Bethlehem which is life's bread house
[1:09:08] and every one of True Believers in
[1:09:09] Christ is born in Christ
[1:09:11] everyone so where were you born this
[1:09:13] morning you were born in Christ and if
[1:09:16] you're born in Christ you're born in
[1:09:18] God's Bethlehem yes he said that not
[1:09:20] only Jesus was born in Bethlehem he said
[1:09:22] I was born in Bethlehem you were born in
[1:09:25] Bethlehem sir so if you're born in
[1:09:27] Bethlehem with him listen you have
[1:09:30] Bethlehem potentials all right now
[1:09:32] remember in the Old Testament you
[1:09:34] couldn't just do like you do today and
[1:09:35] choose a career but where you were born
[1:09:38] and what tribe you were born into told
[1:09:40] what you were going to do y and what
[1:09:43] your nature would be right and what you
[1:09:45] would be like come on now right so if
[1:09:47] you were born into a city of Benjamin
[1:09:50] say your your nature was
[1:09:52] warlike right we went went through that
[1:09:54] with the Tribe of Benjamin how that they
[1:09:55] were warlike and and they they they were
[1:09:58] left-handed and they could they could
[1:09:59] use a sling yeah right so that was their
[1:10:02] nature was war they had that nature and
[1:10:06] there were certain ones born for certain
[1:10:08] things so if you were a bethlehemite you
[1:10:11] had potentials that people born in
[1:10:13] Jerusalem people born any other siloh
[1:10:16] any other City didn't have because they
[1:10:19] had the potentials of being born in a
[1:10:21] place that where there was a prophecy
[1:10:23] that was given
[1:10:24] that this is where the Messiah would
[1:10:26] come
[1:10:27] from I hope you're thinking deep this
[1:10:29] morning this is where the Messiah would
[1:10:31] come from was Bethlehem so Jesus had to
[1:10:34] be born in Bethlehem you remember they
[1:10:36] even had the tax and everything else so
[1:10:38] Jesus would be born in Bethlehem he had
[1:10:40] to be born in Bethlehem why did he have
[1:10:42] to be born in Bethlehem because that was
[1:10:44] the prophesied place for the Messiah to
[1:10:46] come from let me tell you this morning
[1:10:49] some can be born in Baptist they could
[1:10:50] be born Methodist they could be born
[1:10:52] Pentecostal but I was born in the word
[1:10:55] which means I have the potential of a
[1:10:57] messiah anointing on my life come on are
[1:11:00] you hearing me this morning only
[1:11:02] Bethlehem dwellers had the potential to
[1:11:04] be the
[1:11:07] Messiah oh I hope you hear me today only
[1:11:10] those born in Bethlehem had the
[1:11:12] potential to be the Messiah and only
[1:11:14] those born in Christ have the potential
[1:11:16] to be Messiah
[1:11:17] s good yes sir oh that ought to make a
[1:11:21] Baptist sh well it wouldn't but anyway
[1:11:25] oh but we understand don't we yeah you
[1:11:27] know what I'm talking about now John
[1:11:29] 14:12 Jesus said verily verily I say
[1:11:31] unto you he that believeth on me oh it's
[1:11:33] fixing to get good here in a minute he
[1:11:34] said the works that I do shall he do
[1:11:36] also and Greater Works than these shall
[1:11:38] he do because I going to my father look
[1:11:41] look brother B typed him to Papa Eagle
[1:11:43] he said he is Papa eagle and we are
[1:11:45] eaglets he is Messiah we are

[1:19:01] spiritual DNA is the word yeah right
[1:19:03] it's coded in there's information there
[1:19:06] and it's the word speaking back to the
[1:19:08] word so he says the Rand said the word
[1:19:10] speaks to the word when when you were
[1:19:12] born again it was the word coming to the
[1:19:14] word because the word had to be awakened
[1:19:16] in your life now he he didn't just leave
[1:19:19] me without instructions he's given me
[1:19:22] counsel
[1:19:23] yeah even the Bible says that the Holy
[1:19:25] Spirit helps our infirmities we know not
[1:19:28] what we should pray for as we ought but
[1:19:29] the spirit itself make its intercession
[1:19:31] for us with groanings which cannot be
[1:19:33] uttered yes and I don't think we could
[1:19:35] ever be too arrogant about knowing
[1:19:37] what's going to happen in our life
[1:19:38] because we don't even know how we should
[1:19:40] pray but but he does yes he does so we
[1:19:45] look at that and we begin to think well
[1:19:46] how do I know that the voice that's
[1:19:48] speaking to me this voice of the inward
[1:19:50] man this counsel that's coming from the
[1:19:52] inner man how do I know it's right
[1:19:53] because you can have lots of things that
[1:19:55] seem like God speaking and lots of
[1:19:57] people say God spoke and how do I know
[1:20:00] that that it's right well it'll be
[1:20:02] according to the word the Bible says in
[1:20:04] Psalms 119 105 Thy word is a lamp unto
[1:20:06] my feet and a light unto my path one
[1:20:09] Psalm 11 19130 the entrance of thy words
[1:20:12] giveth light it giveth understanding
[1:20:14] into the simple Psalms 19133 order my
[1:20:18] steps in thy word could we say that
[1:20:20] today order my steps in Thy Word you
[1:20:22] remember he said he counts all our steps
[1:20:25] if he counts our steps he can order our
[1:20:27] steps order my steps in thy word let not
[1:20:31] any iniquity have dominion over me
[1:20:33] that's right I don't want to go outside
[1:20:35] your word let me order my steps in thy
[1:20:38] word Proverbs 6:23 for the Commandment
[1:20:40] is a lamp and the law is light and
[1:20:42] reproofs of instruction are the way of
[1:20:46] life so in my path of Life he's going to
[1:20:49] give me correction and I'm so grateful
[1:20:51] for thaten aren't you glad for God's
[1:20:54] correction when you go the wrong way and
[1:20:56] God many times I've headed the wrong
[1:20:58] direction and God arrested me God turned
[1:21:00] me around he did it through a preacher
[1:21:02] or a pastor or he did it through a some
[1:21:05] spiritual person that would help me in
[1:21:06] some way God has helped me many times in
[1:21:08] that way he's corrected me he's
[1:21:10] corrected me by the Bible he's corrected
[1:21:11] me by the message of the hour many times
[1:21:13] and I I say God keep correcting me until
[1:21:16] I'm right make me right I don't want to
[1:21:18] play church I want to be right with God
[1:21:21] all right
[1:21:23] amen so brother Bram tells us that the
[1:21:26] time or not brother brandham Peter
[1:21:28] actually tells us the time has come that
[1:21:30] judgment must begin at the house of
[1:21:32] God right and he said if it first begin
[1:21:35] at us what shall the end of them be obey
[1:21:36] not the gospel of God so God's going to
[1:21:38] correct his children
[1:21:40] first and brother Brenham taught us they
[1:21:42] would not stand correction then they
[1:21:43] were illegitimate right because that's
[1:21:45] what we have to do is come back to the
[1:21:47] word all of us do yes sir so brother BR
[1:21:49] when we come here we're here for one
[1:21:51] specific purpose this this is the house
[1:21:53] of correction this is the
[1:21:54] throne now look what David's saying look
[1:21:58] what he's saying he's saying God you
[1:22:00] instruct me you you give me counsel yeah
[1:22:03] he said and brother Bram tells us that
[1:22:04] when we come to the house of God the
[1:22:06] church he said this is the throne this
[1:22:09] is the throne this is the Throne of God
[1:22:12] now I'm not the judge God's the judge
[1:22:15] the word is the judge right but judgment
[1:22:17] Goes Forth from the house of God he said
[1:22:19] and here's where we come together Gather
[1:22:22] in love yes with one another as only
[1:22:24] Christians can love amen but in here he
[1:22:27] said we are under a leadership of the
[1:22:29] Holy Spirit he said the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:31] Among Us right and we're here to take
[1:22:34] Reckoning among us to see where our
[1:22:37] short places are our shortcoming how we
[1:22:39] can catch from where we should be over
[1:22:41] to where we ought to be now where we are
[1:22:44] and where we ought to be he said and
[1:22:45] that's what we study ministers study
[1:22:47] these places for their people he said
[1:22:49] when they see the people to lack he said
[1:22:51] then they begin on that don't you
[1:22:52] realize what people sometimes get so
[1:22:53] upset about is actually God doing he
[1:22:56] he's he's correcting us he's he's
[1:22:58] surrounding our path of Life he's
[1:23:00] helping
[1:23:01] us again brother BR said Lord we are
[1:23:04] happy this morning to be back in the
[1:23:05] house of God in another service we pray
[1:23:07] God you will correct us to morning of
[1:23:09] all of our errors could that be our
[1:23:10] prayer this morning Lord correct me of
[1:23:12] all my
[1:23:13] errors he said show us the path that you
[1:23:16] have ordained that we should walk show
[1:23:18] us the path that you have ordained we
[1:23:20] should walk oh I love that and give us
[1:23:23] of thy Grace and love that we might
[1:23:25] follow those paths and instructions with
[1:23:27] all of our hearts that we might be found
[1:23:30] that day in Christ blameless for We
[1:23:32] Believe Lord that his appearing is soon
[1:23:35] what a prayer that
[1:23:36] is amen we correct everything by the
[1:23:39] word brother BR said the main thing of
[1:23:40] any gift is getting your own ideas away
[1:23:43] and let Christ he said then whatever is
[1:23:46] said he said if you want to know whether
[1:23:47] it's Christ or not just a sensation
[1:23:49] leave it alone but if it's just an
[1:23:50] emotion leave that alone but if if it's
[1:23:52] written in the word then it's God to
[1:23:55] always judge everything any Spirit tells
[1:23:57] you by the word so the word don't never
[1:23:59] get away from that word he said if you
[1:24:01] do you're lost that's strong but it's
[1:24:04] true look what David says in verse eight
[1:24:06] I have set the Lord are you still with
[1:24:09] me this morning I don't intend to hold
[1:24:11] you long but I just want to I just want
[1:24:13] to punch this in the Joel's going to
[1:24:15] preach tonight now
[1:24:17] listen he said he is first in my life he
[1:24:20] said I've set the lord always before me
[1:24:22] me because he is at my right hand I
[1:24:26] shall not be moved all right he's first
[1:24:29] in my life Everything I Do I Do It the
[1:24:30] foot of his throne what a revelation
[1:24:32] that would be he said wherever you go
[1:24:34] brother B said wherever you go Place God

[1:27:05] Grave I'm going to rest in Hope rest in
[1:27:08] expectation verse 10 for thou will not
[1:27:10] leave my soul in Hell neither Willl thou
[1:27:14] suffer thy Holy One to see corruption so
[1:27:16] I can see David from the beginning of
[1:27:18] his life to the end of his life he's
[1:27:20] saying you've got it all planned out
[1:27:22] right and I don't understand why things
[1:27:24] happen the way they did but you
[1:27:26] understand Lord and you've got it all
[1:27:28] planned out for me so I I can rest in
[1:27:31] hope I can rest in expectation I won't
[1:27:33] settle for something that's against the
[1:27:35] word because I know you want what's best
[1:27:37] for me I've got something I know in the
[1:27:39] end I'm going to be resurrected I know
[1:27:41] you got my life covered from beginning
[1:27:43] to end sir yeah right you protected me
[1:27:45] he said you covered me in my mother's
[1:27:47] womb he said you even you you even
[1:27:50] influenced my my my gen the way I was
[1:27:52] born you covered me amen he planned you
[1:27:56] so now look he said he said when David
[1:28:00] was old and I want to speak for just a
[1:28:02] moment to those of you who have gotten
[1:28:04] older and I know some at home this
[1:28:06] morning and many of you are here our
[1:28:07] elders are are very faithful to the
[1:28:09] house of God and I thank you for that
[1:28:12] but I know as you're getting older you
[1:28:13] begin to look and you realize there's
[1:28:14] more road behind you than in front of
[1:28:16] you right and and recognizing that you
[1:28:19] realize that that well there's got to be
[1:28:21] something something that you hope for in
[1:28:23] the future well David said I can hope in
[1:28:25] this the same God who ordained my path
[1:28:28] of life to this point has also ordained
[1:28:31] a resurrection for me yes wonderful oh I
[1:28:35] hope you hear me this morning the same
[1:28:37] God who's dealt with me as an individual
[1:28:40] From This Moment up to this time that
[1:28:42] same God has also ordained a new body
[1:28:45] for me he said you've already got
[1:28:47] another one waiting all right you
[1:28:49] realize God's not up there frantically
[1:28:51] better hold off for while don't get in a
[1:28:52] wreck so I got I can make your new body
[1:28:55] that's not what he's doing but there's
[1:28:58] already Paul said there was another one
[1:29:01] already waiting sir right another
[1:29:04] Tabernacle another Mansion another body
[1:29:06] already waiting in the heavens when we
[1:29:08] leave this body there's already a word
[1:29:10] body a theophany body that's there so
[1:29:13] now David says I know that there's going
[1:29:16] to be a resurrection and even this body
[1:29:19] will be raised up in a glorified
[1:29:20] condition I know that
[1:29:22] I know that I wonder how many know that
[1:29:24] today what comfort that would give us as
[1:29:26] you get older I know that God's going to
[1:29:29] take care of me yeah that's good thou
[1:29:32] will not suffer th Holy One to see
[1:29:33] corruption brother BR said I see David
[1:29:36] when he was old getting down to the end
[1:29:37] of his road all the physical strength
[1:29:39] was just about gone he said moreover My
[1:29:41] Flesh shall Rest In Hope because he will
[1:29:43] not suffer his holy one to see
[1:29:44] corruption neither will he leave his
[1:29:46] soul in hell right he said he foresaw
[1:29:48] the resurrection of Christ and knowing
[1:29:50] that his body would not stay in the dust
[1:29:52] of the Earth but it would rise again
[1:29:55] right yes sir now Jesus took this and
[1:29:57] you realize now think about
[1:29:59] it David did some bad things the backs
[1:30:03] backslider and died with his family all
[1:30:06] tore up the kingdom actually got taken
[1:30:08] away from because of what David
[1:30:11] did right and and the prophet told him
[1:30:13] said you'll cause many to blaspheme but
[1:30:15] he was still a prophet that's right
[1:30:18] still had divine inspiration because he
[1:30:19] wrote in the
[1:30:20] Bible right
[1:30:22] and so so he's what what's he doing he's
[1:30:25] speaking the word and when he spoke the
[1:30:27] word God chose to write that down or
[1:30:30] have that written and passed on to the
[1:30:32] time of Christ so all Jesus had to know
[1:30:37] that he would be raised was the same
[1:30:39] thing you
[1:30:41] have he had psalm 16 sir right Jesus had
[1:30:46] Psalm
[1:30:48] 16:10 that's all he had and you say well
[1:30:51] I brother Ben I I just need a move of
[1:30:53] God and I believe in the move of God I
[1:30:55] believe in the move of the spirit you
[1:30:56] see what I need a real move of God to
[1:30:58] just just just change me I need I need
[1:31:00] to hear a word from the Lord Brother Ben
[1:31:01] you have a word from the Lord yeah come
[1:31:03] on I'm not saying God can't do special
[1:31:05] things for you he can and will yeah but
[1:31:08] you have a word from the Lord Jesus did
[1:31:10] not rely on a good service to tell him
[1:31:13] he was going to rais from the dead right
[1:31:16] he didn't rely on some preacher speaking
[1:31:18] over his life and doing it he didn't
[1:31:19] rely on on even something like that he r
[1:31:21] on the written word he could read this
[1:31:24] word oh my just like you can read it and
[1:31:27] it and it quickened to him because of
[1:31:29] who he was all right and God said That's
[1:31:32] you yeah amen oh because he was the word
[1:31:36] oh don't you realize today that that
[1:31:37] same word that you be you can be quick
[1:31:39] into that same word and say we shall not
[1:31:41] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[1:31:43] the moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[1:31:44] the last Trump you can actually be quick
[1:31:46] and that word the same way he was come
[1:31:49] on yes sir amen
[1:31:52] all right so now Jesus Took the word and
[1:31:55] believed it what did he believe it so
[1:31:57] much that he stood there and he told him
[1:31:59] he said destroy this Temple and in three
[1:32:02] days I'll rise it up raise it up look
[1:32:05] brother B said in the grave Jesus body
[1:32:07] was quickened by the word of God and
[1:32:09] transformed from a dead cold image to a
[1:32:12] resurrected glorified Son of God because
[1:32:14] the prophet Psalm 16:10 if you want to
[1:32:16] put it down said I will not leave his
[1:32:17] soul in Hell neither will I suffer my
[1:32:19] Holy One to see corruption he said oh
[1:32:20] God that word has to come to pass it's
[1:32:23] God's word when are we going to quit
[1:32:25] playing with the word and just believe
[1:32:26] it when are we going to quit reasoning
[1:32:28] with it and just believe what it says
[1:32:29] and say I want it for my life I want it
[1:32:32] I want it because that's what's going to
[1:32:33] raise me up I'm not going to reason with
[1:32:36] it I'm not going to mess with it I want
[1:32:37] it for my life amen Wonder yes that word
[1:32:41] has to come to pass will not leave his
[1:32:43] soul in Hell neither will I suffer my
[1:32:45] Holy One to see corruption he said it's
[1:32:47] God's word plant it in your heart yeah
[1:32:50] he said if you want to go go in a
[1:32:52] Rapture how many want to go in a Rapture
[1:32:54] well it ought to be everybody I would
[1:32:55] think we'd all want to go in a Rapture
[1:32:57] you don't want to go through the
[1:32:57] tribulation then you want to go in a
[1:32:59] Rapture if you want to go in a Rapture
[1:33:01] he said if you want to be Christians
[1:33:03] genuine how many want to be a genuine
[1:33:05] Christian if you want to be a genuine
[1:33:08] Christian place this word come on put it
[1:33:11] before you always I'm going to be I can
[1:33:14] live as a Christian I can do what God
[1:33:16] says this word is
[1:33:18] true
[1:33:19] wonderful it's true no matter how I feel
[1:33:22] or no matter what's happened to me or no
[1:33:23] matter how many excuses I have the word
[1:33:25] is still true
[1:33:26] right that's
[1:33:29] good as he said I believe it was Ezekiel
[1:33:31] God said take that scroll and eat it
[1:33:33] up the prophet and the word would become
[1:33:36] the same we're living in that hour yeah
[1:33:38] there was a time God winked at ignorance
[1:33:40] brother Brenham taught us now that the
[1:33:41] seals have been open there's come a time
[1:33:44] when we're supposed to become the word
[1:33:46] yeah right all of the word go back to
[1:33:49] the beginning oh that's what I want yes
[1:33:52] amen it's a message of restoration he
[1:33:53] said notice every promise in there has
[1:33:55] to manifest itself because it's God's
[1:33:57] original seed he said don't you let some
[1:33:59] educated Theologian out there try to
[1:34:01] pump it out of you don't you let him
[1:34:03] spray you with that carnal science and
[1:34:04] knowledge and education believe God how
[1:34:07] many can say Amen to that
[1:34:09] today he said let's think about
[1:34:13] David excuse me he said he got all
[1:34:16] stimulated too he said my cup is running
[1:34:19] over yeah he said I believe he really
[1:34:21] had a great event in his life what
[1:34:24] caused him to do that he said when he
[1:34:26] was in the spirit for he was a prophet
[1:34:28] he said the Bible say so Prophet David
[1:34:29] he was a prophet he was in the spirit he
[1:34:31] seen the resurrection he said if you'd
[1:34:33] like to read this in Psalms 168 to11
[1:34:35] moreover My Flesh was made glad I rest
[1:34:37] in Hope because I I you'll not leave my
[1:34:39] soul in Hell neither will you suffer
[1:34:40] your Holy One to see corruption he said
[1:34:41] I tell you his cup got running over yeah
[1:34:46] right his cup got run over brother brand
[1:34:48] that's in the fourth still brother brand
[1:34:49] was talking about stimulation of
[1:34:50] Revelation he he said his cup got
[1:34:52] running over if it did that for David
[1:34:54] when he wrote it yeah what ought it to
[1:34:56] do for us I believe it did it for Jesus
[1:34:59] too when he saw it that's why he could
[1:35:01] say with such Assurance destroy this
[1:35:03] body in three days I'll raise it up yeah
[1:35:06] why he read that same word it was
[1:35:07] quickened to him and that same spirit is
[1:35:10] here today to Quicken the same word for
[1:35:12] ROM taught us that the mechanics and the
[1:35:14] Dynamics were here you said when did
[1:35:16] they get here they've been here the
[1:35:17] whole time since the opening of the word
[1:35:19] the mechanics and the Dynamics are here
[1:35:22] yes then it's time to be participate in
[1:35:25] that be a part of that yes let your cup
[1:35:28] run over amen with stimulation of
[1:35:30] Revelation because the word is true yeah
[1:35:33] that's good he was happy in his old age
[1:35:36] yeah so it is possible to live a long
[1:35:38] time and be happy yeah do you believe
[1:35:40] that I know we have some wonderful
[1:35:43] Elders here in the church that prove
[1:35:45] that he was happy in his old age because
[1:35:47] he saw the same God and knew him from
[1:35:49] his mother's womb would also raise him
[1:35:52] up Hallelujah but watch this before we
[1:35:55] close the BR said God has set all his
[1:35:58] laws to serve him both natural and
[1:36:01] spiritual working according to his word
[1:36:04] regardless of the conditions all
[1:36:07] right right regardless of the conditions
[1:36:11] a storm on the earth doesn't change the
[1:36:14] way the sun
[1:36:17] moves now I think about it I'm no
[1:36:19] scientist but every little every little
[1:36:24] thing that Earth does doesn't affect the
[1:36:27] way the planets move together why
[1:36:30] because they move by a higher law a
[1:36:33] stronger law a law of God and in nature
[1:36:36] that takes the form of like gravity and
[1:36:39] things like that so there's laws of God
[1:36:42] that he set in motion and scientists
[1:36:44] look at this and say ha there's no God
[1:36:46] we can explain all of this right yeah we
[1:36:49] can explain how the Earth standing there
[1:36:50] and all this this but who started it all
[1:36:53] where did the first Speck of life come
[1:36:55] from why is that a law they know gravity
[1:36:58] is a law we know why it's a
[1:37:00] law right so there is a law of gravity
[1:37:03] there's there's laws that God has that
[1:37:05] that make the the Earth and the moon and
[1:37:07] the sun all these things work according
[1:37:09] to his own word that law it's very
[1:37:12] simple it's just always going to do it
[1:37:13] that way now he said he his laws has to
[1:37:16] work according to his word he said he
[1:37:18] commanded the sun he commanded the moon
[1:37:20] he Comm commanded the Earth he commanded
[1:37:22] nature and they all fall right in line
[1:37:25] and all the laws work in harmony with
[1:37:27] God's spoken word and the law of life
[1:37:30] that's in us he said will bring us to a
[1:37:33] resurrection yeah he said it's got to
[1:37:36] it's impossible for it not he said
[1:37:39] that's the reason he said the law of
[1:37:41] life that was in Christ he said when the
[1:37:43] word was spoke it said I'll not suffer
[1:37:45] my Holy One to see corruption neither
[1:37:48] will I leave his soul in hell now look I
[1:37:51] want I want you to stop there for a
[1:37:51] minute don't read the rest of it until I
[1:37:53] now stop for just a minute look he said
[1:37:56] I won't leave you soul in hell that was
[1:37:58] a law right but remember Jesus was the
[1:38:01] word yeah he was born the word are you
[1:38:04] with me now he had instructions written
[1:38:08] in
[1:38:08] him when he was born to rise from the
[1:38:13] dead right it was a law of Life yeah the
[1:38:17] instructions were already
[1:38:19] there oh hope you hear now the
[1:38:22] instructions were there so because the
[1:38:24] law was there when he read the word and
[1:38:27] believed the word the word that was in
[1:38:29] him matched the word that he read That's
[1:38:32] why not everybody was saved like you
[1:38:34] were not everybody's life changed like
[1:38:36] yours did why did your life change
[1:38:37] because you read the word but one day it
[1:38:39] was Quicken to you and the word spoke to
[1:38:41] the word and the word the law of life
[1:38:44] that is in you actually matches oh I I
[1:38:47] just want to run around and Shout for a
[1:38:48] minute but I I won't I'll be good but
[1:38:50] look look there wasn't plus it would wi
[1:38:52] me to run around he said there wasn't
[1:38:54] but listen there wasn't enough time
[1:38:56] listen there wasn't enough Devils all
[1:38:58] right there wasn't enough anything to
[1:39:00] keep Christ in that grave till his body
[1:39:02] begin to rot because the law of God
[1:39:04] would bring the word to
[1:39:07] pass you just think about it for a
[1:39:09] minute when that first sell was just
[1:39:12] about like corruption was just about to
[1:39:14] set
[1:39:16] in I said
[1:39:19] no good there there's a law written
[1:39:22] inside of him the law of life was in
[1:39:26] Christ and he believed the word and
[1:39:28] anointed that word and when the oh my
[1:39:30] don't you realize you have that same law
[1:39:32] if you're a seed of God you you the said
[1:39:34] you weren't born on any day you always
[1:39:36] were in the mind of God if you're a seed
[1:39:38] of God there's something written inside
[1:39:40] of you when the Resurrection comes you
[1:39:42] will rise you can't help but raise up
[1:39:46] you've got to yeah law of life that's in
[1:39:49] us will bring us to a resurrection amen
[1:39:52] look he said and the law of God by his
[1:39:55] holy
[1:39:56] spirit brings any someone say
[1:40:00] any any promise to
[1:40:03] pass any promise yeah got to be a
[1:40:06] promise that's why if the spirit that's
[1:40:08] speaking to you telling you to do
[1:40:10] something doesn't match the word it's
[1:40:12] not a promise of God right and so the
[1:40:15] holy spirit will not be with you you
[1:40:16] might feel like it is yeah you might you
[1:40:19] might the devil will deceive you make
[1:40:21] you think that it is but it's not right
[1:40:23] it's got to be according to the written
[1:40:25] word it's got to oh my because the
[1:40:28] spirit will only Quicken the
[1:40:30] instructions that are already there does
[1:40:32] that make sense right right it can't
[1:40:34] bring uh uh something that's not a law
[1:40:36] of God to pass yeah he said and the law
[1:40:39] of God for the Holy Spirit brings any
[1:40:40] promise to pass he said you get it
[1:40:42] regardless of the conditions job said
[1:40:45] though the skin worms destroy my body
[1:40:47] yet in my flesh I'll see God my
[1:40:49] regardless of how little little we are
[1:40:52] listen how low we are how impure we are
[1:40:54] oh you ought to take hope this morning
[1:40:57] listen God don't care what condition
[1:40:58] you're in yeah he doesn't care a bit
[1:41:00] what condition you're in but he wants to
[1:41:02] change you right and you've got to yield
[1:41:05] to the word to be
[1:41:07] changed there's no other way but
[1:41:09] surrender no other way but but but
[1:41:11] repentance yeah it's good you've got to
[1:41:14] come that way you can't come to God and
[1:41:16] dictate to God how you're going to be
[1:41:18] and what you're going to be God's got to
[1:41:20] do that in your life life right that's
[1:41:22] why he gives us pastors and and Men of
[1:41:24] God and evangelists and people that will
[1:41:26] preach repentance yeah right because
[1:41:28] you've got to repent to to achieve that
[1:41:31] that that's got to Die the seed that you
[1:41:33] have that're covered brother said it's a
[1:41:35] germ of Life inside a cird and the
[1:41:37] Cleber has got to die yeah yet the
[1:41:40] sticky nature remains but the inside of
[1:41:42] that's got to die so that you can be
[1:41:44] born something else right are you with
[1:41:47] me now so so no matter how Unholy we are
[1:41:51] how sick we are if you sick this morning
[1:41:53] how Afflicted we are the law of God's
[1:41:56] spirit by his word makes it obey him
[1:41:59] forces the issue and says give it
[1:42:02] back Oh my he said oh if we could just
[1:42:06] think of that for a minute forces it
[1:42:07] regardless of conditions no matter what
[1:42:09] the condition is the law of God's word
[1:42:11] forces the condition to cope with his
[1:42:14] word yeah it's got to that's good it's
[1:42:17] got to it's
[1:42:19] wed to bring it to pass that's why I
[1:42:23] began this by saying you're not a victim
[1:42:25] you're a
[1:42:27] Victor that's the mindset we have to
[1:42:29] have now look musicians go ahead and
[1:42:33] come David said he was speaking of
[1:42:37] life he said now did you notice that
[1:42:41] last verse he said thou Wilt show
[1:42:43] me the path of
[1:42:46] Life thou Wilt show me the path of Life
[1:42:49] Brandon preaches the seron called the
[1:42:51] path of Life did you notice will you

[1:43:08] lions
[1:43:10] are going to eat me up but they can't
[1:43:13] yeah I'm a Child of
[1:43:16] God so there got to be chains
[1:43:19] somewhere right
[1:43:21] good there's got to be chain somewhere
[1:43:24] for all I need to know is where to walk
[1:43:26] yeah so I don't get eaten by the lon and
[1:43:30] God calls men you believe he still uses
[1:43:32] men God uses men to preach the word and
[1:43:35] cry out stay in the middle of the road
[1:43:38] stay in the middle of the word because
[1:43:39] if you get out of it you're going to get
[1:43:40] eaten by the Lions that's what they're
[1:43:43] there for and and the the mistrustful
[1:43:46] and the timorous they run away but those
[1:43:47] who believe the word they walk right
[1:43:49] down the middle of the road
[1:43:51] sure you you will show me the path of
[1:43:53] Life Lord when I get to that part of the
[1:43:56] road where it seems like there's no way
