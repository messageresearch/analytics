[40:48] a good profession before many witnesses

[40:52] seats this evening
[40:55] and jude would tell us earnestly which
[40:58] intensely with an attitude
[41:01] contend which means simply to fight
[41:05] for the faith that was once delivered
[41:08] unto the saints and brother brown would
[41:10] say it like this he said the word
[41:12] has to be made alive
[41:14] it's a dead letter
[41:17] amen until it's made manifest though so
[41:20] he needs somebody to manifest his word
[41:23] and then it's quick in other words it's
[41:25] made alive
[41:26] and it's brought to pass and god said
[41:28] about it and what god said about it he
[41:30] said that's the gospel in action the new
[41:34] testament christianity that's where we
[41:37] like to speak to you tonight for a
[41:39] little while on the new testament
[41:41] christianity

[41:45] news it's
[41:47] and here he tells us is is the gospel in
[41:50] action it's uh it's taking the promises
[41:53] of god and and taking the word of god
[41:56] and making it live and the hour that
[41:58] we're living in to to bring it and
[42:00] elevate it off the pages of this book
[42:03] and and be written of pistols read of
[42:05] all men and
[42:07] and we realized he said the crush in the
[42:10] true church is the continuation of the
[42:12] book of acts and the book of acts is is
[42:16] was the apostles it was it was people
[42:19] like you and i
[42:20] have been putting god's word to a test
[42:23] and bringing forth the manifestation of
[42:25] god's promises and amen this the book of

[42:31] action can you say amen so the new
[42:33] testament christianity is the gospel

[43:24] bill of david

[44:21] life and
[44:24] and take possession of or overtake or
[44:27] seize the promises that god has allotted
[44:30] for us in this day and hour that we're
[44:32] living in the scripture said the violent
[44:35] take it by force in other words it's to
[44:37] seize or snatch away or or to claim
[44:40] that's yours and caleb's claim that
[44:42] every promise in the book is mine
[44:46] every chapter every verse hey friends

[44:49] song i want it to be reality in my life
[44:53] and hey ben and i hope this evening that

[44:58] i hope this will just sink deep in the
[45:00] hearts of believers hey ben that it's
[45:02] not an hour of just talking to talk but
[45:05] it's time for the believer to make a
[45:07] step of faith and and though scripture
[45:09] would tell us we walk by faith and not
[45:12] by sight
[45:13] new new testament christianity ain't
[45:16] professors it's possessors
[45:20] and brother man would say like this i

[45:24] out he says oh my his righteous in the
[45:27] nation began to come upon him he got a
[45:30] little fight in him he said that's what

[45:40] and stand up and claim your god-given
[45:42] privileges

[45:47] he said little old schamber got his
[45:49] righteous intonation up he looked around
[45:51] he couldn't find nothing he wasn't a
[45:53] warrior but what it was in his hand he
[45:56] couldn't find nothing but an ox kill he
[45:58] said that's all he had but brother he
[46:01] was sick and tired of the philistines

[46:18] this and i can't do that he said god
[46:20] bless your heart all things are possible
[46:24] to feel that belief he said that's it
[46:27] shamgar said i'm sick and tired of it
[46:29] and i'm not a warrior the odds are
[46:32] against me no matter how much odds are
[46:34] against you

[46:49] i'm a child of god tonight i know
[46:52] diseases come from the devil i know god
[46:55] promised me victory he said wow his
[46:57] righteous intonation rose and he grabbed
[47:00] that old ox goat
[47:03] and he jumped through the window
[47:05] he had he challenged 600 blessings and
[47:08] he stood there and beat their heads in

[47:38] church is not an option brother joe it's
[47:40] not an option tonight you use this type
[47:44] of faith even the devil will have to
[47:47] back up
[47:49] and then i'm here to declare the good
[47:52] news the gospel all hell brother david
[47:55] is against us but all heaven is for us
[47:58] if god be for us who can be against us
[48:01] tonight
[48:03] and then the prophet would say
[48:05] what we need today
[48:08] man that just words like that just
[48:10] sticks out to us
[48:12] or you'd hear the prophet said don't
[48:14] miss this
[48:16] or he makes statements like this okay he
[48:18] said
[48:19] this is what we have need of and our
[48:21] ears should say
[48:24] don't miss this what we need today is
[48:27] some real genuine faith
[48:31] not only genuine faith but he said put
[48:33] it to action
[48:35] what we need is real faith men who dare
[48:38] to put god's word to their heart and to
[48:41] apply it to themselves
[48:45] hallelujah put into action if the woman
[48:48] with an issue of blood hey they could
[48:51] reach out and touch the hymn of his
[48:53] garment
[48:54] so can i
[48:56] hey man if they could get his attention
[48:58] hey ben if the if the blind man can get
[49:01] his attention if the woman with an issue
[49:03] of blood can get his attention i heard
[49:05] that probably god screaming it out ain't
[49:07] been in the message of putting faith to
[49:09] action hey bet he said if they could do
[49:12] it brother harvey's so can i
[49:14] if if someone was healed yesterday so
[49:18] could i if somebody was delivered
[49:20] yesterday so can i
[49:22] hallelujah
[49:24] amen but people
[49:25] are starving to death
[49:28] not just in the natural but spiritual
[49:32] they are starving to death
[49:36] but there's not a lack of word
[49:39] there's not a lack of anointing there's
[49:41] not a lack of promises
[49:45] but we find in the scripture that it
[49:47] tells us aaron samuel amen when jonathan
[49:50] heard abandoned not what his father
[49:53] charged the people he chose them not to
[49:55] eat or drink
[49:57] but the scripture said jonathan heard
[49:59] not whether his father charged the
[50:01] people within home where he put forth
[50:03] this end of his rod with his hand
[50:07] and he dipped it
[50:09] come on somebody
[50:10] hey but he dipped it into the honeycomb
[50:13] right he made god's provided place of
[50:17] worship
[50:18] he provided some honey and it was there
[50:22] everybody else was starving to death
[50:24] they was fatigued they was weary
[50:26] they was fainting they were discouraged
[50:29] they was defeated
[50:31] but when jonathan came back from the
[50:33] battle he was tired hey but god provided
[50:38] jonathan
[50:39] with spiritual food and due season
[50:43] when everybody else was starving god
[50:46] provided jonathan
[50:48] and i'm here to declare to you tonight
[50:50] even when everybody else is starving
[50:53] but god provided you
[50:56] he provided you strength he provided a
[51:00] lamb
[51:02] hallelujah amen
[51:05] and even the scripture said he dipped it
[51:07] he put it to action
[51:09] he bet he didn't wait on the pastor to
[51:11] do it
[51:12] he didn't wait on a revival to come he
[51:14] didn't wait on some great uh meeting
[51:16] brother allen to come or some youth camp
[51:18] to come
[51:20] amen when he needed it it was provided
[51:22] and he had to put it to action
[51:25] and jonathan the scripture said took his
[51:28] rod and dipped it down into the
[51:30] honeycomb it ain't the lack of word and
[51:33] ain't no lack of uh uh
[51:35] of anointing
[51:37] no sir anybody even the probably god
[51:40] said and
[51:41] that when he shot up the air of god's
[51:43] deliverances it wasn't a lack
[51:46] of promises
[51:48] he said you would only destroy your
[51:50] enemy
[51:51] but you quit striking
[51:56] it's the truth
[51:58] amen
[52:00] psalms tells us
[52:02] 119-45 so thou has commanded us
[52:05] to keep thy precept diligently
[52:08] all that my ways my journey
[52:11] my direction my march
[52:14] were directed to keep thy statues
[52:18] are actioned
[52:19] prescribed action prescribed or
[52:22] prescribed tasks in other words david
[52:25] said the house commanded us to keep thy
[52:29] precepts that word
[52:31] that my ways my journey my march
[52:34] my direction
[52:36] would be directed and i would keep that
[52:38] way and i would i i would stay on the
[52:41] firing line
[52:43] and the scripture our brother brad would
[52:45] tell us nothing can stand between a
[52:48] believer marching or going toward a
[52:51] promise
[52:54] so new testament christianity is acting
[52:57] on the prescribed
[52:58] task walking by faith every devil that
[53:02] tries to stand between you and your
[53:04] prescribed tasks will be conquered
[53:07] do you believe that
[53:08] amen that's paul we we use paul light
[53:11] but paul was his prescribed task was
[53:14] wrong there's a lot of things that
[53:16] transpired along the way hey but nothing
[53:19] could stop the man of god a believer
[53:21] going to meet the promises of god a man
[53:24] snake bit couldn't stop and prison walls
[53:27] couldn't stop him
[53:28] shipwreck couldn't stop him none of
[53:30] these things moved me hey but why
[53:33] because he was walking and prescribed
[53:36] tasks from almighty god
[53:38] and god told you to come amen you're
[53:41] going to make it
[53:44] hallelujah
[53:46] joshua 1 tells us moses my servant is
[53:49] dead
[53:50] now therefore arrives
[53:52] stand up don't be lazy
[53:55] go over
[53:56] move
[53:58] action this jordan
[54:00] every place the soul that your feet
[54:02] shall tread upon
[54:04] that i have given unto you as i said
[54:06] unto moses
[54:07] i would rather brother brown would said
[54:09] this i would rather be found a failure
[54:13] than too lazy to try
[54:16] one time it was said that that that this
[54:19] company hired a man he was going to sign
[54:21] his name and the man had no eraser on
[54:23] the end of the pencil y'all know the
[54:25] story and he said why have you got an
[54:27] eraser he said i don't make mistakes
[54:30] he said i can't use you
[54:33] listen to this statement i can't use you
[54:35] because you don't make mistakes you
[54:37] won't do nothing
[54:41] babe was a home run king
[54:43] it wasn't a lack of trying he struck out
[54:45] many times
[54:48] the probably god's using this for the
[54:50] illustration i can't use you don't be a
[54:53] i'd rather be found a failure than too
[54:55] lazy to try
[54:58] and he says true because you make
[55:00] mistakes you won't do nothing god don't
[55:02] hold your sponsor for your mistakes
[55:06] he holds your response over your willful
[55:08] sin
[55:09] he that sins whimply and they receive
[55:11] the knowledge of the truth but a man
[55:14] that's going to do something is going to
[55:16] blunder
[55:17] he's going to fall he's going to make
[55:20] mistakes but if he's really divinely
[55:22] called and god in his heart he'll rise
[55:26] again
[55:28] a by the footprints a man means
[55:31] possession so what the church needs
[55:33] tonight
[55:36] pay attention that's what he said he
[55:38] said what the church needs tonight is
[55:40] some more footprints over here in the
[55:41] land
[55:42] nothing can stop us
[55:45] nothing's gonna stand in god's church
[55:48] she's moving
[55:50] come on somebody hey but she's not a
[55:53] lazy christian
[55:55] hey but nothing's going to stand in
[55:57] god's church she's moving
[56:00] footprints are action
[56:02] moving is an action
[56:04] she's moving towards cain and canaan is
[56:08] a promise
[56:10] amen and nothing can stand between a
[56:13] believer
[56:15] going to meet the promises of god
[56:18] amen so listen
[56:20] if there is a prescribed task
[56:23] for you tonight
[56:24] and you're walking you like walk through
[56:26] the valley of the shadow of death
[56:29] you might go through some trials and
[56:31] tempt temptations persecution famine
[56:34] sword nakedness
[56:36] you might go through mountaintops desert
[56:38] times
[56:39] valley experiences but this one thing is
[56:42] for sure hey ben that you're gonna rise
[56:45] rise rise above it all right
[56:48] excuse my voice and i am losing it quick
[56:50] tonight hey but listen friends hey ben
[56:53] god has prescribed a task for you and i
[56:56] tonight
[56:58] this world is not our home
[57:02] hallelujah this world is not my home
[57:05] that should make us want to shout
[57:07] tonight hey but praise god this ain't my
[57:10] prescribed task with brother and sister
[57:12] tonight our prescribed task apprentice
[57:15] not this world
[57:19] and he'll rise again if god is in his
[57:22] heart
[57:23] nothing's gonna stand she's moving
[57:26] there's nothing it's an irresistible
[57:28] force god will move everything
[57:32] he said moses got a little scared down
[57:34] there at the sea and began to cry to the
[57:37] lord and said lord said why are you
[57:39] crying to me
[57:41] he said what before you cry to me speak
[57:45] yes
[57:47] speak right and go forward
[57:50] haven't i commissioned you to a job
[57:53] ain't you got a prescribed task
[57:57] amen speak
[57:58] and he says speak what
[58:01] he said the word of god
[58:03] that's in you
[58:06] hallelujah
[58:07] hey ben not your own word your thoughts
[58:09] or your own words but speak god's word
[58:13] that's in you
[58:15] and go forward
[58:17] make a leap of faith don't cry to me go
[58:20] forward so speak
[58:22] and put it to action
[58:24] see god's word is always progression
[58:27] right and we could call it through the
[58:29] message brother and would teach us
[58:30] there's a horse and buggy there's an
[58:32] automobile there's an airplane there's a
[58:35] rocket
[58:36] a bed it's always progressing hey but
[58:39] it's always moving forward a bit brother
[58:41] man would deal with it even the four
[58:43] beasts which represents power of the
[58:45] book of revelation it speaks of a
[58:48] a
[58:49] face like a like an ox or a lion or a
[58:52] man or a flying eagle but brother baby
[58:54] said all those are
[58:56] as moving forward hey but there's no
[58:59] it's always advancing
[59:01] they couldn't go brother made that
[59:03] statement brother david he said those
[59:04] anointings could never go backwards
[59:07] hallelujah it always went forward about
[59:10] to meet the challenge of the age
[59:14] hallelujah even what anointing in this
[59:17] hour to meet the challenge of the of the
[59:20] age so satan doesn't care how much you
[59:23] talk
[59:24] but when a believer begins to advance
[59:28] it begins to move hell begins to tremble
[59:32] and they said like this let the bride
[59:34] say
[59:35] amen
[59:37] not just from the lips
[59:40] or the church down the road can do that
[59:44] but the amen is so be it
[59:47] it's in other words putting god's word
[59:49] into action
[59:51] let the bride say amen
[59:53] amen the church down the road can do
[59:56] that if it's only lip service but that
[59:59] you as a believer take god at his word
[1:00:03] and allow that living word that was
[1:00:05] spoken out of you
[1:00:09] isn't that what he said i better let
[1:00:11] that word hey that's within you speak
[1:00:16] and punctuate it with an amen
[1:00:19] amen we can say amen all day long but if
[1:00:22] you're not moving or if you're not
[1:00:23] putting and putting god's word to action
[1:00:26] hey
[1:00:27] not the new testament christianity it's
[1:00:30] not just an amen from the lips but it's
[1:00:33] a soviet it's a caleb mentality give me
[1:00:36] my mountain
[1:00:38] a better nothing was going to stop caleb
[1:00:40] from embracing his promised land
[1:00:44] hey bed
[1:00:46] so it's more than just lip service caleb
[1:00:48] stepped into his amen
[1:00:50] and brother baby makes statements like
[1:00:52] this action speaks louder than words
[1:00:57] i'd rather you live a sermon than preach
[1:01:00] me one i know you've heard these things
[1:01:02] there's one thing to say something
[1:01:05] it's another thing to do something
[1:01:07] it's not hearers it's doers
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:15] so it's not just
[1:01:16] just saying amen
[1:01:18] and we love that in the church man that
[1:01:20] preacher loves the amends and y'all's
[1:01:22] doing a great job tonight that's
[1:01:24] punctuating the word you're saying amen
[1:01:25] you're punctuating with an amen
[1:01:29] but i really think
[1:01:31] punctuating with an amen is more than
[1:01:33] just saying amen in a church house
[1:01:36] but it's an everyday walk

[1:05:56] hallelujah you're acting upon the word
[1:05:59] then you'll see the miracle of god
[1:06:00] that's right but first you have to act
[1:06:05] on it
[1:06:07] your thoughts
[1:06:08] will become words
[1:06:10] and words will become material
[1:06:12] he said that's when the church is in its
[1:06:14] power
[1:06:16] nothing can stop this type of church
[1:06:18] so be it
[1:06:22] so be it

[1:06:34] luke tells us
[1:06:35] as he internet i'm hurting do you love
[1:06:38] the lord tonight
[1:06:40] can i have just a little bit more
[1:06:41] monsters please
[1:06:43] and luke 17 12-15 says as he entered
[1:06:47] into a certain village
[1:06:49] there met in ten men that were leopards
[1:06:51] which stood afar off
[1:06:53] and they lifted up their voice and said
[1:06:55] jesus master
[1:06:57] have mercy on us and when he saw them he
[1:07:01] said unto them
[1:07:03] go show yourself unto the priest
[1:07:06] and it came to pass
[1:07:09] it came to pass as as
[1:07:12] can you read that for me
[1:07:14] as
[1:07:15] they
[1:07:16] went
[1:07:20] how easy it would have been waited on
[1:07:21] jesus and bring it to him
[1:07:23] or wait on the pastor to give it to him
[1:07:25] or wait on the revival but the scripture
[1:07:28] says as jesus spoke to them and told him
[1:07:31] go down to the priest
[1:07:35] and as they went
[1:07:37] they were clenched
[1:07:39] and one of them when he saw that he was
[1:07:41] healed turned back with a loud voice and
[1:07:43] glorifying god as they win an action
[1:07:47] i say why set her and be defeated as we
[1:07:50] preach many times with the four lepers
[1:07:52] why sit here till you die let's go down
[1:07:54] to the enemy's camp take back what
[1:07:56] belongs to us
[1:07:57] hey but as they win
[1:07:59] if you start
[1:08:01] god will finish it
[1:08:04] i like that statement
[1:08:06] actions unlock the power resided in
[1:08:10] faith
[1:08:12] by our unbelief we activate fear
[1:08:16] by walking by faith we activate his
[1:08:19] promises
[1:08:21] and then brother brown would step into
[1:08:22] this he said you got his attention
[1:08:24] talking about blind bartimaeus he said
[1:08:25] what did he do here's faith going into
[1:08:28] action he throws aside his garment
[1:08:31] i won't need this anymore i'm going to
[1:08:33] be a new creature from now on and he
[1:08:35] threw aside his garment how could he see
[1:08:38] out in a dark black world where he
[1:08:40] couldn't see nothing he spread forth his
[1:08:42] ragged sleeves
[1:08:44] like that and his bony arms sticking
[1:08:46] through it and he made his way to find
[1:08:48] jesus no matter what condition he was in
[1:08:50] he had his attention he didn't know
[1:08:52] which way he was going to go he knowed
[1:08:54] he'd come from this direction so here he
[1:08:57] goes with his arms stretched out ragged
[1:08:59] sleeves hanging down tears running from
[1:09:01] his place where eyes should be
[1:09:04] he didn't know how he was going to find
[1:09:06] him but the word of god said come
[1:09:08] and he was going he said there's the
[1:09:10] main thing about the word of god said
[1:09:13] come and he was going
[1:09:16] jesus just simply said go down to the
[1:09:18] priests as they went and put god's word
[1:09:21] to action
[1:09:24] they was cleansed
[1:09:27] hallelujah hey but he didn't know how
[1:09:29] he's going to get there
[1:09:33] but when he said come
[1:09:35] that's the main thing no matter how sick
[1:09:38] you are
[1:09:39] how bad you are how many trials you had
[1:09:42] when he said whosoever will let it come
[1:09:45] he meant you how am i going to get it
[1:09:47] brother branham how am i going to make
[1:09:49] it how am i going to get there the
[1:09:51] doctor says i can't get well throw that
[1:09:54] aside today church ought to be jesus
[1:09:56] christ and action upon the earth
[1:09:59] that's what the church needs get into
[1:10:01] action
[1:10:02] we got too much form we got too much

[1:10:08] action and put god's word
[1:10:11] and put it to action it's mine
[1:10:15] every promise in the book is mine
[1:10:18] these footprints is mine
[1:10:21] and this is my inheritance i don't want
[1:10:24] anybody to take my place or not i don't
[1:10:27] want the rocks to cry at my place
[1:10:30] i want to let the lord know tonight
[1:10:32] whose side i'm on
[1:10:35] hallelujah amen as they went and one of
[1:10:38] them recognized that he was healed he
[1:10:40] began to praise god i say tonight praise
[1:10:43] him if you feel i can praise him if you
[1:10:45] don't
[1:10:47] his word is still true whether you feel
[1:10:49] like it or not whether you see it or not
[1:10:52] whether you feel it or not god said by
[1:10:55] his stripes you are healed

[1:11:20] for as many are led by the spirit of god
[1:11:23] they are the sons of god
[1:11:27] he said let them soak down into the
[1:11:29] church

[1:15:42] and wickeder he says
[1:15:46] brother harvey as this world is going
[1:15:48] farther and further insane and getting
[1:15:50] more wickeder or more wicked
[1:15:53] if it's going that way
[1:15:55] the church is going the other way
[1:15:58] she's getting stronger she's moving
[1:16:01] closer to him
[1:16:02] oh church i believe we're getting so
[1:16:04] close we've reached the point of no
[1:16:06] return
[1:16:08] i believe we're gonna be like enoch as
[1:16:10] the world's getting so farther out of
[1:16:12] chaos hey but we're gonna be drawn so

[1:16:28] last step
[1:16:31] hallelujah how many believes are to be a
[1:16:33] rapture
[1:16:35] the rapture is not going to be
[1:16:36] consistent with lazy christians
[1:16:40] but the rapture is going to be consist
[1:16:42] of those
[1:16:43] warriors
[1:16:45] battle scarred warriors
[1:16:47] that wasn't ashamed of the gospel that
[1:16:50] stood for god's word and his promises
[1:16:54] didn't wait on somebody else
[1:16:58] but didn't get their eyes on the
[1:17:00] circumstances but kept their eyes on
[1:17:02] their calling
[1:17:05] hallelujah
[1:17:07] and as they're getting wickeder the
[1:17:09] churches get more powerful more powerful
[1:17:12] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:17:15] spirit of the lord
[1:17:18] raises up a standard against it he says
[1:17:20] hallelujah he says let's go
[1:17:23] glory the winds are blowing
[1:17:26] set yourselves church move right on to
[1:17:29] the face of the storm knowing god's got
[1:17:32] this
[1:17:33] hallelujah what are you going to sit
[1:17:35] here and be discouraged today
[1:17:38] or you can set yourselves in the wind of
[1:17:40] yahweh this morning or this evening
[1:17:44] and let that wind of you always begin to
[1:17:46] pull you in the directions you need to
[1:17:48] go have been the sons of god are led by
[1:17:50] the spirit of the lord
[1:17:53] we don't understand his ways sometimes
[1:17:55] his ways are so much greater than ours
[1:17:57] his thoughts are so much greater than
[1:17:59] ours
[1:18:01] hallelujah
[1:18:05] but we learn to just shake it off
[1:18:08] and stomping under our feet
[1:18:10] and i've told that story here many times
[1:18:14] but it's true
[1:18:16] if that mule that fell in that sister
[1:18:19] would have gave up he would have been
[1:18:21] buried
[1:18:22] in his depression
[1:18:24] his funny feelings
[1:18:28] hey bad
[1:18:30] but every time that farmer would take a
[1:18:31] shovel of dirt and put it on him
[1:18:35] he would take that heavy load and begin
[1:18:37] to shake it off
[1:18:39] in other words he began to put into
[1:18:40] action and stop it under his feet
[1:18:44] he batted in him before long he would
[1:18:46] seem to be
[1:18:47] encouraged by what he's seeing
[1:18:51] hey
[1:18:52] this might work
[1:18:54] her farmer took another load of heavy
[1:18:57] soil and put it upon his back and the
[1:18:59] old dumb mule began to shake it up for
[1:19:01] the helmet and
[1:19:03] stomp that funny feelings under his feet
[1:19:06] stop that sickness right under your feet
[1:19:09] and before you know it he was a little
[1:19:10] higher
[1:19:13] hey

[1:19:16] right i'm you ain't very smart but he
[1:19:18] was smart ever know if i keep doing this
[1:19:21] if i keep taking everything the devil
[1:19:23] throws my way and stomping under my feet
[1:19:27] before long i'm going to step right out
[1:19:29] of this hole that i got myself into
[1:19:31] hallelujah hey man if we'll put god's
[1:19:34] word to action
[1:19:37] we can either sit here and be dried up
[1:19:39] and dead
[1:19:41] or we can begin to shake off those
[1:19:42] things that's so easily beset us
[1:19:45] and stomping under our feet and lift our
[1:19:47] hands to praise him say lord i'm that
[1:19:50] much closer to you and the next trial
[1:19:52] that comes just shake it off stomp it
[1:19:54] under your feet say oh lord i'm that
[1:19:56] much closer to you lord don't let me be

[1:20:02] off your shoulder go ahead shake it off
[1:20:07] say brother joe i just don't feel like
[1:20:09] praising like i used to i don't feel
[1:20:11] like saying it like i use i don't feel
[1:20:13] like well maybe the load's getting heavy
[1:20:16] maybe it's a nice or not that you begin
[1:20:19] to shake off those things so so easily

[1:24:48] bloodline
[1:24:50] hallelujah satan could not penetrate the
[1:24:54] seal of almighty god
[1:24:56] and though i got weak in my flesh and

[1:31:57] brother harvey he still had the symptoms
[1:32:00] he still was hurting he still had to
[1:32:02] make another doctor's visit

[1:32:27] and they made it to the super bowl
[1:32:30] and over there is many hours separating
[1:32:33] from what are here in the states so when
[1:32:35] they played the game here
[1:32:37] it wasn't televised over there two hours
[1:32:39] later
[1:32:40] so and as the story goes and they had a
[1:32:43] big super bowl party and all of his
[1:32:46] friends gathered at the super bowl party
[1:32:48] because they would watch the super bowl
[1:32:49] and
[1:32:50] and as they begin to watch it
[1:32:53] their favorite team
[1:32:54] you know they was down and
[1:32:56] and they was losing and
[1:32:58] and and all of his friends bro david
[1:33:00] they was discouraged you know how hey
[1:33:03] the cardinals ain't doing good you know
[1:33:04] how you feel razorbacks having a
[1:33:06] razorback fan and a cardinal fan not as
[1:33:08] much as brother david is but
[1:33:10] you know we we we we get we we get
[1:33:12] involved with our teams it's just it's
[1:33:14] who we are and hey
[1:33:16] it would grow to a hogs fan your hogs
[1:33:18] fan and and
[1:33:20] and when they do bad he was like oh the
[1:33:22] reps ain't
[1:33:24] them dumb rips and dumb umpires and
[1:33:27] you know and and then somebody that's
[1:33:29] rooting for the other team is saying
[1:33:30] that they're quite often very excited
[1:33:32] about what's going on and then they can
[1:33:34] flip around but they was all discouraged
[1:33:37] in the moment because our team was
[1:33:39] losing and
[1:33:40] there was fumbles there was
[1:33:41] interceptions there was all this
[1:33:44] they've been with this one guy you know

[1:34:06] bowl

[1:34:14] excited and happy all the way and we
[1:34:16] made failures we made mistakes and we
[1:34:19] thought the interceptions were fumbling
[1:34:21] the ball and the coach had made the
[1:34:23] right calls the reps have been making
[1:34:24] wrong calls and
[1:34:27] he said well guys i got to make a
[1:34:29] confession
[1:34:30] i listened at the game on the radio this
[1:34:32] morning
[1:34:33] and we won
[1:34:36] come on somebody the fumbles didn't mean
