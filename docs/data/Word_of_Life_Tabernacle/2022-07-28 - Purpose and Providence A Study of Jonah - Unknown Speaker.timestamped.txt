[51:14] thank you brother alan matthew chapter
[51:15] 12 and verse 39
[51:17] matthew chapter 12 and verse 39 i want
[51:20] to
[51:21] tell you that if you're
[51:23] not here tonight
[51:24] you'll want to watch this
[51:28] and not because i'm preaching but
[51:31] it'll give you a better idea of where
[51:32] we're going
[51:33] maybe in in the future on wednesday
[51:35] night
[51:36] uh maybe just for the next couple of
[51:38] services i don't know yet but i want to
[51:40] talk to you about jonah
[51:42] and we're going to talk to you about
[51:45] about jonah's life as a prophet and what
[51:48] he did and what he said and what the
[51:51] lord did through him
[51:52] and we'll deal with that maybe for a few
[51:55] services so you want to
[51:56] listen to tonight so you kind of get a
[51:58] background for where we're going just
[52:00] going to lay the foundation tonight
[52:02] matthew 12 and 39
[52:04] says but he answered and said unto them
[52:06] an evil
[52:07] and adulterous generation
[52:10] seeketh after a sign and there shall no
[52:13] sign be given to it but the sign of the
[52:15] prophet
[52:16] jonas
[52:17] for as jonas was three days and three
[52:20] nights in the whale's belly
[52:22] so shall the son of man be three days
[52:23] and three nights in the heart of the
[52:25] earth
[52:26] the men of nineveh shall rise in
[52:27] judgment with this generation
[52:30] and shall condemn it because they
[52:32] repented at the preaching of jonas
[52:35] and behold a greater than jonas
[52:38] is here i want you to realize tonight
[52:41] that the men of nineveh were gentiles
[52:43] non-elect
[52:46] think about it
[52:48] but the men of israel were the elected
[52:51] nation of god
[52:53] and he said the men of nineveh the
[52:55] non-elect
[52:56] will rise
[52:57] in their with this generation and
[52:59] condemned this generation who were
[53:02] supposedly the elect of god
[53:04] and because they repented
[53:07] this generation didn't
[53:09] oh my what a thought tonight god bless
[53:11] you may be seated
[53:14] i'll start preaching before i let you be
[53:16] seated that wouldn't be a good thing
[53:20] the name jonah has become kind of a bad
[53:22] word to the modern age and
[53:25] even in ancient times sailors who read
[53:28] this story
[53:29] if they had someone in the boat that was
[53:31] considered kind of a jinx and was clumsy
[53:34] they'd call him a jonah and they'd kick
[53:36] him out and
[53:37] get rid of him and so
[53:40] there was an element that was identified
[53:43] with jonah as being somebody who was bad
[53:45] somebody who
[53:46] uh had
[53:48] disobeyed god and he did that and
[53:50] somebody who
[53:51] moved away from god and he did that and
[53:53] yet jesus
[53:55] did not
[53:56] did not talk of him did not speak of him
[53:59] in that way at all but jesus spoke of
[54:01] him as a sign and showed his life in a
[54:04] bigger picture that his life was
[54:07] actually a sign
[54:09] of the son of man and that it was a sign
[54:11] of the resurrection and so he said i'm
[54:13] going to show you
[54:15] he said i'm going to there's a
[54:16] generation that'll be seeking after a
[54:19] sign there won't be a sign given to it
[54:21] except for the sign of the prophet jonah
[54:24] and then we know that we can tie that to
[54:26] our h that that was the sign of the
[54:28] resurrection of a living jesus christ
[54:31] that came in our day through a prophet
[54:33] named william branham that we actually
[54:35] saw that god had that jesus raised from
[54:38] the dead and he proved it in our
[54:40] generation
[54:42] and so
[54:43] in that way jonah was a precursor or a
[54:46] preview of our day now
[54:48] again it's become kind of a bad word but
[54:50] brother branham kind of always takes up
[54:52] for jonah
[54:53] in most of it but then he also
[54:55] identifies where jonah ran from the
[54:57] presence of god and if you'll go and
[55:00] listen to that sermon a man running from
[55:02] the presence of god you begin to see
[55:06] that that there was jonah who was doing
[55:08] wrong yet in the bigger picture god was
[55:11] using him as a sign of something else so
[55:14] i want you to know tonight that jonah's
[55:16] ministry teaches us if you're writing
[55:18] this down or if you can keep this in
[55:19] your mind it teaches us about purpose
[55:23] and providence
[55:24] purpose and providence
[55:27] you have a purpose in your life now it
[55:29] also teaches us about perfect will
[55:32] and permissive will
[55:34] how many have ever heard of that before
[55:37] perfect will and permissive will there's
[55:39] a difference in purpose and providence
[55:42] there's a difference in perfect will and
[55:44] permissive will but i want to start up
[55:46] front tonight with telling you that we
[55:48] should never seek the permissive will of
[55:51] god
[55:52] there has there was a day when god
[55:54] winked at that ignorance but now he
[55:56] calls all men to repent this is the hour
[55:58] when there's going to be a bride who's
[56:00] in the perfect will of god in our day
[56:03] how many believe that today
[56:05] we're supposed to be in the perfect will
[56:06] of god
[56:07] and yet we can see in our lives
[56:09] sometimes we've done things that we've
[56:11] made mistakes and we've done things and
[56:13] we can find that even in those times
[56:15] brother branham said he makes his his
[56:17] permissive will glorify his perfect will
[56:20] and i've put it this way in the past but
[56:22] it's always struck me that somehow his
[56:24] permissive will made his perfect will
[56:27] more perfect
[56:30] now i don't understand that
[56:32] because i'm not god
[56:34] oh but aren't you glad that you serve a
[56:36] god who is so great
[56:39] that when you disobey him and you do the
[56:42] things that you weren't supposed to do
[56:44] that ought to give us comfort tonight
[56:46] that even his permissive will is so
[56:49] great that he can actually use it to
[56:51] make his perfect will more perfect
[56:54] to glorify his perfect will
[56:56] oh my what a god we serve tonight
[56:59] amen i just love getting into the word
[57:01] don't you because these things really
[57:03] reassure us and build us up
[57:05] now
[57:06] jesus identified his life as a sign
[57:08] brother branham says god never changes
[57:11] he said he always does it in the same
[57:13] way
[57:14] he said the coming of a prophet
[57:17] is a sign you got to catch up with me
[57:19] joel
[57:20] this is joel's first night running the
[57:22] slides
[57:24] he says the coming of a prophet is a
[57:26] sign that god is ready to speak
[57:30] the coming of a prophet is a sign
[57:33] that god is ready to speak see the
[57:35] pentecostals in our day saw the sign of
[57:37] a prophet
[57:39] but didn't recognize that god was ready
[57:42] to speak
[57:44] so now
[57:46] but we realize that prophets don't
[57:48] always know
[57:49] what their sign exactly means
[57:52] especially not early in their ministry
[57:54] they don't always understand it even the
[57:56] greatest prophets did not fully
[57:58] understand their own life and impact and
[58:00] i want you to know tonight that it's
[58:02] okay if you don't fully understand what
[58:05] god's doing in your life
[58:07] you don't see the big picture
[58:09] right because it changes every day
[58:12] you don't know and you you know that but
[58:14] it gave from recently that brother gabe
[58:16] was praying about something that looked
[58:17] like it was completely wrong and it
[58:19] looked like that the will of the lord
[58:21] had moved in a different direction and
[58:22] then suddenly it turned around that's
[58:24] the way our lives are
[58:26] we we don't know what we don't know
[58:28] brother jt we would have never guessed
[58:29] that we'd have ended up here
[58:31] right you'd never guess that this would
[58:33] things would happen the way they have
[58:35] and we don't know we don't always know
[58:37] and that's okay
[58:38] you're just acting out the drama you
[58:40] don't have you don't have the road map
[58:43] that he has you don't have necessarily
[58:45] all see all the parts like he does
[58:48] he's in a higher position he's able to
[58:50] see it and a prophet in our day could
[58:51] look and see some of those things but in
[58:53] your own life as an individual many
[58:55] times you don't understand what god is
[58:58] doing but he still does it anyway amen
[59:01] amen even though you don't understand he
[59:03] realized david when he stood there and
[59:05] he said my my bones they stare at me he
[59:07] said they pierced my hands and my feet
[59:09] he thought he was talking about himself
[59:11] he thought they said this is a strange
[59:13] thing to say he did not understand but
[59:15] god still did it anyway
[59:17] he didn't understand why he went through
[59:19] what he went through but god was showing
[59:21] something in his life jonah may perhaps
[59:23] didn't even understand why he was
[59:24] swallowed by a whale why you had to go
[59:26] through what he went through but god
[59:28] used it anyway for his own glory
[59:30] amen amen
[59:33] so the greatest prophets don't always
[59:35] understand their own life and impact how
[59:36] are we going to
[59:39] and when you try to figure everything
[59:40] out
[59:41] and figure out your impact in the world
[59:43] and your place in the world
[59:45] you need to know your place
[59:47] but you need to know your place in its
[59:49] simplicity when you try to figure
[59:51] everything out and you try to dwell on
[59:53] what's going to happen tomorrow
[59:55] constantly you end up in trouble
[59:58] because you don't know what's going to
[1:00:00] happen tomorrow
[1:00:02] you're trying to arrange the will of god
[1:00:04] and god knows more than you do that's
[1:00:06] what jonah was doing
[1:00:08] he's trying to change what he knew god
[1:00:10] told him to do
[1:00:12] he's trying to make it into something
[1:00:13] else but that never works
[1:00:16] now
[1:00:17] i want you to know and i want us to
[1:00:19] think tonight like jonah would have
[1:00:21] thought
[1:00:23] so in order to to fully understand him i
[1:00:25] think to maybe be more sympathetic
[1:00:27] towards him we'd have to think like he
[1:00:30] thought
[1:00:31] and in order to think like he thought it
[1:00:33] may not be too hard for some of us
[1:00:36] because we think a lot like the the jews
[1:00:39] did in one way and that's that they
[1:00:41] understood that they were the elect
[1:00:45] they understood that they were god's
[1:00:46] people
[1:00:47] now remember they were elect as a nation
[1:00:49] we were elected as individuals
[1:00:52] but they understood that they were god's
[1:00:54] people
[1:00:55] they knew that we know that today
[1:00:59] in deuteronomy 7 and 6
[1:01:01] moses told him he said thou art and holy
[1:01:03] people unto the lord thy god
[1:01:05] the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be
[1:01:07] a special people
[1:01:09] unto himself above all people that are
[1:01:11] upon the face of the earth
[1:01:13] boy that sounds pretty good don't it
[1:01:16] walk around to the moabites and the and
[1:01:19] the and and the amalekites and
[1:01:21] all the other heights that were out
[1:01:22] there and say i'm an israelite
[1:01:25] god told me that i was special
[1:01:28] god told me i was i was a special people
[1:01:31] we're a special people we're above all
[1:01:33] the people that are upon the face of the
[1:01:35] earth
[1:01:36] but he goes on to explain it he said the
[1:01:38] lord did not set his love upon you nor
[1:01:41] choose you because you were more in
[1:01:43] number than any people for you are the
[1:01:45] fewest of all people
[1:01:47] but because the lord loved you
[1:01:51] and because he would keep the oath which
[1:01:54] he had sworn unto your fathers that the
[1:01:56] lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[1:01:58] and redeemed you out of the house of
[1:02:00] bond men from the hand of pharaoh king
[1:02:02] of egypt
[1:02:03] know therefore that the lord thy god he
[1:02:06] is god
[1:02:07] the faithful god
[1:02:09] why aren't you glad he's faithful today
[1:02:11] know that the lord is faithful which
[1:02:13] keepeth covenant and mercy with them
[1:02:16] that love him and keep his commandments
[1:02:18] to a thousand generations and repeateth
[1:02:20] them that hate him to their face to
[1:02:22] destroy them he will not be slack to him
[1:02:24] that hateth him he will repay him to his
[1:02:26] face so they could see this and see
[1:02:29] we're special people these ninevites are
[1:02:32] are non-elect they're not god's people
[1:02:34] we are
[1:02:36] so israel was abraham's natural seed i
[1:02:39] just realized joel that that quote
[1:02:41] wasn't on the sides i was giving you a
[1:02:42] hard time about
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:48] israel was
[1:02:49] joel's good for me because it's comic
[1:02:51] relief while i'm preaching
[1:02:54] israel was abraham's natural seed
[1:02:56] let me understand that tonight we're the
[1:02:58] spiritual seed of abraham i know this
[1:02:59] elementary but we're going somewhere
[1:03:01] building something
[1:03:03] abraham was god's man
[1:03:05] right abraham come out and
[1:03:07] and he was just
[1:03:09] an idol maker his father was an idol
[1:03:11] maker and had a god shop and abraham
[1:03:13] walked in
[1:03:14] he was just a normal uh guy just of the
[1:03:17] earth he was a gentile he wasn't
[1:03:19] anything special but god called abraham
[1:03:23] he called abraham he was god's man and
[1:03:26] in genesis 12 1 the lord said to abram
[1:03:28] get thee out of that country
[1:03:30] and from thy kindred and from thy
[1:03:32] father's house and to a land that i will
[1:03:34] show thee and i will make of thee a
[1:03:37] great nation now notice he doesn't say
[1:03:39] now if you do this to do everything
[1:03:42] right
[1:03:43] i'll make him be a great nation
[1:03:45] and if you will
[1:03:47] if you'll do this i'll do this no he
[1:03:49] says get out of your country because i
[1:03:52] will
[1:03:53] make it be a great nation
[1:03:55] i will bless thee
[1:03:57] make thy name great thou shalt be a
[1:03:59] blessing
[1:04:00] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:04:03] and curse him that curseth thee and in
[1:04:04] thee shall all families to the earth be
[1:04:06] blessed and abraham must have thought
[1:04:07] this is a pretty good deal
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:12] now brother branham says god had a
[1:04:13] covenant with adam the first man on the
[1:04:15] earth and that covenant was on
[1:04:16] conditions if you do so and so i'll do
[1:04:19] so and so adam would have had something
[1:04:21] to do
[1:04:22] now listen in order to keep the covenant
[1:04:24] alive before god
[1:04:25] he'd had something to do he had to walk
[1:04:28] in god's ways keeping all of his word
[1:04:30] not breaking one word
[1:04:32] now doesn't that sound familiar because
[1:04:34] we're to do that
[1:04:35] we're supposed to do that but the
[1:04:37] covenant is not conditioned on that
[1:04:41] god said i will make you a bride
[1:04:44] that will not fall
[1:04:47] i will make you a bride that will keep
[1:04:49] my word
[1:04:50] that will not break one word
[1:04:53] he said i will
[1:04:54] have a bride oh that gives me confidence
[1:04:57] today it's not up to me or any other
[1:04:58] preacher to preach you into a level of
[1:05:01] being that that's what he said he would
[1:05:03] do
[1:05:04] by the message of the hour
[1:05:06] hey man so we just preach his word and
[1:05:08] keep moving on because it's his promise
[1:05:10] that he has to keep
[1:05:12] he's obligated to keep his promise now
[1:05:14] notice
[1:05:15] he said so you're keeping all of his
[1:05:17] word not breaking one word but then he
[1:05:19] made another covenant that was with
[1:05:21] abraham this covenant was not on
[1:05:22] conditions but was unconditionally god
[1:05:25] gave the covenant to abraham no strings
[1:05:27] tied to it at all
[1:05:30] now think about that for a minute no
[1:05:32] strings
[1:05:34] no strings abraham if you go to church
[1:05:37] three times a week and jump up and down
[1:05:39] and shout and holler and run the isles
[1:05:40] that's not what he said
[1:05:43] no strings
[1:05:45] oh my
[1:05:47] we don't do those things because we have
[1:05:49] we do it to fulfill our part of the
[1:05:51] covenant that's not what it's about
[1:05:53] we don't have meetings to well we've got
[1:05:55] to have so many meetings a year and run
[1:05:57] around so many places a year so that we
[1:05:59] can fulfill our part no we do that
[1:06:00] because we love god
[1:06:03] because we want to do the perfect will
[1:06:04] of god we don't want to be in the
[1:06:05] permissive will of god we want to be in
[1:06:07] his perfect will so we strive to keep
[1:06:09] his perfect will but it's because he
[1:06:11] made an unconditional covenant with us
[1:06:14] and jonah would have understood this
[1:06:17] i'm the elect
[1:06:20] my people we were made an unconditional
[1:06:22] covenant
[1:06:24] now look
[1:06:25] he said not no strings tied to it at all
[1:06:28] unconditional not i
[1:06:29] not he said i i will i have i've already
[1:06:32] done it
[1:06:34] now
[1:06:35] israel was very very aware of this
[1:06:39] deuteronomy 10 and 14.
[1:06:41] behold the heaven and the heaven of
[1:06:43] heavens
[1:06:44] i want you to notice this because one of
[1:06:46] the things about the book of jonah
[1:06:49] and i'm thinking
[1:06:51] faster than what i can what i can speak
[1:06:54] here but
[1:06:55] some one of the things about the book of
[1:06:57] jonah
[1:06:58] is that the book of jonah tells us that
[1:07:01] god cares
[1:07:02] about more than just us
[1:07:06] he cares about things that go on among
[1:07:08] the non-elect
[1:07:11] right
[1:07:12] and so sometimes he will make it hard on
[1:07:14] the elect
[1:07:16] for the benefit of the non-elect
[1:07:21] now that seems difficult for us that is
[1:07:24] difficult for us to understand
[1:07:26] but sometimes god will make life harder
[1:07:28] you can see it all through the scripture
[1:07:30] on the elect
[1:07:31] for the benefit of the non-elect
[1:07:34] he cares about even
[1:07:36] the non-elect it's not that he doesn't
[1:07:38] care and this is what moses is saying
[1:07:40] deuteronomy 10 14 behold the heaven and
[1:07:43] the heaven of heavens is the lord thy
[1:07:46] god lord thy god the earth also with all
[1:07:50] that therein is so he said it all
[1:07:51] belongs to me
[1:07:53] the elect the non-elect it's all mine
[1:07:56] does that make sense
[1:07:58] it's all under my command
[1:08:01] he could put he can do to it whatever he
[1:08:02] wanted to but brother brandon said it
[1:08:04] was like a woman that took a piece of
[1:08:05] cloth and was sewing he said she would
[1:08:07] take a pattern put it over the cloth and
[1:08:09] cut out the pattern he said from the
[1:08:11] same material
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] this part would be the chosen the elect
[1:08:17] and the rest of it would be the rest
[1:08:20] the part that was cast off
[1:08:23] so now they were aware again of this and
[1:08:26] he said but he said the lord
[1:08:28] owns the earth he owns everything
[1:08:30] only the lord had a delight in thy
[1:08:32] fathers to love them
[1:08:35] and he chose their seed after them even
[1:08:38] you above all people as it is this day
[1:08:41] for thou art and holy people unto the
[1:08:44] lord thy god and the lord had chosen me
[1:08:46] to be a peculiar people unto himself
[1:08:48] above all the nations that are upon
[1:08:51] the earth david put it this way in
[1:08:53] psalms 33 12 blessed is the nation whose
[1:08:56] god is the lord and the people whom he
[1:08:59] had chosen for his own inheritance
[1:09:03] he has a right to do that god has a
[1:09:05] right to have kids
[1:09:06] see it that way to choose who he wants
[1:09:08] to be his own children
[1:09:10] just like you do
[1:09:12] but now
[1:09:13] being chosen by god
[1:09:15] you would think that the israelites
[1:09:17] would have things easy
[1:09:20] and if you look at the history of the
[1:09:22] jews of the uh of the israelite people
[1:09:25] you'll find that they had things
[1:09:27] maybe more difficult than any other
[1:09:29] group of people that's ever lived on the
[1:09:31] face of the earth
[1:09:33] they're hated everywhere they go
[1:09:35] and the jews have always understood that
[1:09:37] being chosen
[1:09:38] was a blessing
[1:09:40] but also a burden
[1:09:43] it was a great honor a source of respect
[1:09:47] and honor
[1:09:48] but also a great responsibility
[1:09:52] because it was their job
[1:09:54] to
[1:09:55] to reflect
[1:09:56] god who the true god was to the world
[1:10:00] right he come to abraham into his seat
[1:10:03] and said all these all these other folks
[1:10:05] are worshiping gods many gods great
[1:10:08] spirits sons moons all these other
[1:10:10] things but i'm going to reveal to you
[1:10:13] what if god come to you and he said i'm
[1:10:15] going to reveal to you how to really
[1:10:17] worship me now that would not be a
[1:10:19] source of pride
[1:10:21] that would be a great that would be a
[1:10:22] great responsibility
[1:10:26] a great responsibility
[1:10:29] because now it would be incumbent on you
[1:10:32] whether people knew who god was
[1:10:35] and how god was represented on the earth
[1:10:38] and sometimes they failed miserably at
[1:10:40] that
[1:10:41] because when they were supposed to be
[1:10:43] representing jehovah they went after
[1:10:45] many other gods
[1:10:46] when they were supposed to be
[1:10:47] representing jehovah they messed up and
[1:10:50] they they they served other gods and
[1:10:52] they went after and god time and time
[1:10:54] again had to bring them back they were
[1:10:56] his chosen people but he had to he had
[1:10:58] to bring plagues and he had to bring
[1:10:59] sicknesses and he had to bring he had to
[1:11:01] bring all kinds of things on him all
[1:11:03] kinds of judgments on his own people to
[1:11:05] try to get them back in line
[1:11:08] and yet they would never be forsaken
[1:11:11] until finally in paul we get an
[1:11:12] understanding and i don't have time to
[1:11:14] go back and and look at all of these
[1:11:16] scriptures but just to kind of give you
[1:11:17] an overview tonight and then we'll get
[1:11:19] into it but in paul we have an
[1:11:21] understanding that not all israel is
[1:11:23] israel that there's a remnant always
[1:11:25] even in elijah's time there's a remnant
[1:11:27] who's not bowed their knee to baal
[1:11:30] so we find that even among them there
[1:11:32] was
[1:11:32] there was we could say an elect and an
[1:11:34] intellect
[1:11:35] even among them there was some who would
[1:11:37] serve god and some who wouldn't but now
[1:11:40] we have the fact that they are calling
[1:11:42] themselves the chosen people of god that
[1:11:45] puts a certain responsibility on them
[1:11:48] we have responsibility today
[1:11:51] responsibility to carry the message
[1:11:54] we don't talk about that much anymore
[1:11:57] we talking
[1:11:58] i don't know how to do this without
[1:11:59] sounding like i'm complaining because
[1:12:01] i'm not
[1:12:02] but we talk a lot about what the message
[1:12:04] does for us
[1:12:07] we should
[1:12:09] the message changed my life
[1:12:13] this message
[1:12:14] the revelation that this message brought
[1:12:16] to me makes me different
[1:12:19] changes me
[1:12:20] heals me amen are you with me now amen
[1:12:25] it it i don't know what it did for you
[1:12:27] but i could shout all night about what
[1:12:28] this message did for me
[1:12:31] changed my family lineage
[1:12:34] broke the curses off my family this
[1:12:36] message did a lot for me
[1:12:39] but i wonder sometimes if we kind of
[1:12:40] turn that around and realize there's a
[1:12:42] responsibility that comes with it
[1:12:44] saying i'm a message believer
[1:12:47] and i was i guess on this trip to egypt
[1:12:49] i guess i was kind of overwhelmed by
[1:12:51] that on some level because i'm like if i
[1:12:54] have an opportunity to go to those who
[1:12:56] have never heard but there's some people
[1:12:58] in our community that have never heard
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:01] but if i have opportunity then if
[1:13:02] they're receptive and that's the
[1:13:04] difference many times over here is that
[1:13:06] people are so blinded by
[1:13:07] denominationalism and things that
[1:13:09] they're just they're just not receptive
[1:13:11] to the gospel but if i do have that
[1:13:13] opportunity and i don't say that you
[1:13:14] should go out like jehovah's witnesses
[1:13:16] and beat the doors down but i do have a
[1:13:18] if i have an opportunity i have a
[1:13:20] responsibility
[1:13:22] right so i'm not going necessarily
[1:13:24] knocking on all the doors and hardy have
[1:13:26] you heard about the message and say well
[1:13:28] yeah that was so-and-so's group you know
[1:13:30] but you know that's not what it is as
[1:13:32] much as when i have opportunity to live
[1:13:35] before the people in such a way that
[1:13:36] they would understand that god is
[1:13:38] reflecting himself has revealed himself
[1:13:40] to me
[1:13:41] do i do that i have a responsibility to
[1:13:43] do that
[1:13:46] that's why i don't take off being a
[1:13:47] christian on vacation
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:50] right
[1:13:52] that's why we don't stop being
[1:13:53] christians when we leave the church
[1:13:56] right because we have a responsibility i
[1:13:59] am an ambassador for the message of the
[1:14:01] hour
[1:14:02] i'm an ambassador for the word that god
[1:14:05] sent in our hour which is this word made
[1:14:07] alive and made relevant to my day
[1:14:11] oh god shown the light on the part of
[1:14:13] the word that would be that would show
[1:14:14] me what to do and and how to act and the
[1:14:17] revelation i could have for my day to
[1:14:19] change my body one day
[1:14:21] that election is a responsibility jonah
[1:14:24] had that responsibility god wasn't going
[1:14:26] to come down to the king of nineveh
[1:14:27] directly
[1:14:28] right
[1:14:29] now listen he wasn't going to come down
[1:14:31] directly to the king of nineveh and say
[1:14:32] now you repent he could have but that's
[1:14:35] not how god does things
[1:14:37] if god wants to save the non-elect
[1:14:40] or even for some purpose hidden in his
[1:14:43] own heart
[1:14:45] to cause a temporary reprieve to come on
[1:14:48] a nation
[1:14:49] from judgment
[1:14:51] now think about it how is he going to do
[1:14:53] that
[1:14:54] he does it through the elect
[1:14:57] he doesn't do it through the non-elect
[1:14:59] he does it through the elect
[1:15:01] so there's somebody that god wants to
[1:15:02] heal
[1:15:03] you realize god wants to heal some
[1:15:05] people who are not non-elected right
[1:15:07] and just for his own purposes he wants
[1:15:09] to heal a person right we don't know why
[1:15:12] we can't explain it maybe one day we'll
[1:15:14] understand
[1:15:15] but he wants to heal somebody amen who's
[1:15:17] the non-elect
[1:15:19] you understand he does sometimes
[1:15:21] over the bed surely he wouldn't
[1:15:23] sometimes he does
[1:15:25] now how is he going to do that
[1:15:27] how is he going to do that he's not
[1:15:28] going to do that through the non-elect
[1:15:31] as much as he will through the elect
[1:15:33] now god does things in all kinds of
[1:15:35] different ways he heals in all kinds of
[1:15:36] different ways but sometimes many times
[1:15:38] most of the time he wants to use the
[1:15:40] elect for the benefit of the non-elect
[1:15:42] even when it's hard on the elect to do
[1:15:45] it now think about it if god wanted to
[1:15:48] heal somebody or he wanted to help
[1:15:50] somebody or he wanted to present the
[1:15:52] gospel to somebody just so they could
[1:15:54] reject it
[1:15:58] and he chose to do it through you what
[1:16:00] if that person was your enemy
[1:16:03] i want you to think about it tonight
[1:16:06] what if that person was your enemy
[1:16:09] maybe your husband or your wife
[1:16:12] or your family
[1:16:14] or somebody you don't even know other
[1:16:15] than that
[1:16:16] you know they didn't do a good job on
[1:16:18] your car
[1:16:21] or they swindled you out of some money
[1:16:25] or they're a nation who's against what
[1:16:28] your nation stands for
[1:16:31] or they come from another political
[1:16:33] party
[1:16:36] what if god wanted to use you for the
[1:16:38] herald to save a democrat
[1:16:43] now think about it for a minute what if
[1:16:45] god wanted to use you to to cause and
[1:16:48] again not that you would could make them
[1:16:50] elect they may not be may or may not be
[1:16:51] we don't know who is and who isn't
[1:16:53] you couldn't make them elect but what if
[1:16:55] god wanted to move through us as a
[1:16:57] little church to affect people who are
[1:17:00] both the elect and the non-elect some
[1:17:02] who are not elect what if he wanted to
[1:17:03] use us and yet we when we go through
[1:17:05] life we make so many enemies
[1:17:10] that's what jonah did
[1:17:13] nineveh was the enemy of israel
[1:17:16] god said i don't care about your grudge
[1:17:23] i don't care about your unforgiveness
[1:17:28] i don't care about the fact that they
[1:17:29] destroyed your land
[1:17:31] and come in and marched over them and
[1:17:33] even was prophesied to do it again jonah
[1:17:35] being a prophet would know that they
[1:17:37] would do that one day
[1:17:39] he said i don't care about that
[1:17:41] go preach to nineveh
[1:17:45] see jonah didn't want to give nineveh a
[1:17:47] chance
[1:17:50] oh god
[1:17:52] and it was a life-and-death kind of
[1:17:53] issue because jonah knew as long as
[1:17:56] nineveh had a chance of being a nation
[1:17:58] as long as judgment was forestalled for
[1:18:00] nineveh then they had an opportunity to
[1:18:02] come against israel and fulfill the
[1:18:04] prophecy written about them that they
[1:18:06] would come into israel and destroy it
[1:18:10] there's a lot more here than what we
[1:18:11] realize
[1:18:12] now look
[1:18:14] there are civilizations that lasted for
[1:18:16] hundreds of years with no judgment for
[1:18:18] worshiping false gods
[1:18:20] and yet israel couldn't get by with it
[1:18:22] hardly at all
[1:18:24] and jonah knew that nineveh was
[1:18:26] predestinated i i went and and read i've
[1:18:29] been reading a a book of bible
[1:18:31] characters and this is a writer from
[1:18:34] 1800 sometimes probably 150 years ago
[1:18:37] but i thought he was perceptive about
[1:18:39] this he said nineveh as jonah new was
[1:18:41] predestinated and prepared and
[1:18:43] prophesied of god to be the fast coming
[1:18:45] scourge in the cruel prison house of the
[1:18:48] conquered and captive israel and such
[1:18:50] was the power and the policy of nineveh
[1:18:52] and such was the sin and the weakness of
[1:18:55] israel that jonah could look for not one
[1:18:57] atom of hope for his country unless it
[1:19:00] was in the great and insufferable
[1:19:01] wickedness of nineveh and then the swift
[1:19:03] and sure judgment of god against nineveh
[1:19:06] it was in jonah's best interest that
[1:19:08] nineveh not have a reprieve from
[1:19:10] judgment
[1:19:13] he was actually happy with the
[1:19:15] wickedness of nineveh because it meant
[1:19:17] they would be judged quickly
[1:19:19] or he felt like they would they were his
[1:19:21] enemy
[1:19:22] and rightfully so
[1:19:24] but he lacked the bigger picture he
[1:19:26] liked the perspective of the prophet
[1:19:28] isaiah who come on the scene after jonah
[1:19:30] died but isaiah said this he said oh
[1:19:32] assyrian the rod of mine anger
[1:19:35] so jonah sees the assyrians as his enemy
[1:19:38] ninevites the assyrians the assyrian
[1:19:40] nation nineveh was the capital
[1:19:42] and jonah sees him as an enemy of god
[1:19:45] but isaiah sees him as a rod in the hand
[1:19:48] of god
[1:19:49] he said and the staff in their hand is
[1:19:51] mine indignation
[1:19:52] i will send him against an hypocritical
[1:19:54] nation against the people of my wrath
[1:19:56] will i give him a charge to take the
[1:19:58] spoil to take the prey to tread them
[1:20:00] down like the mire of the streets how be
[1:20:02] it he meaneth not so in other words he's
[1:20:05] not doing it because he has any special
[1:20:08] hatred for the jews he said neither does
[1:20:10] his heart think so he don't think he's a
[1:20:12] bad person the ninevites don't they
[1:20:14] didn't plan on doing it but it is in his
[1:20:16] heart to destroy and cut off nations not
[1:20:19] a few so nineveh the nineveh began to be
[1:20:22] power-hungry the ninevites the assyrians
[1:20:24] began to be power-hungry begin to spread
[1:20:25] their empire they didn't even know why
[1:20:27] they were doing it but isaiah said it
[1:20:29] was a rod in the hand of god
[1:20:31] and the prophet come and told us a
[1:20:32] similar thing about the russians in this
[1:20:34] hour he said don't fear communism it's a
[1:20:36] tool in the hand of god
[1:20:41] so now
[1:20:43] it's in his heart why is it in his heart
[1:20:45] to go against ukraine
[1:20:47] now think about it because he's a tool
[1:20:49] in the hand of god
[1:20:54] so the jews could see that nineveh or
[1:20:56] the assyrians would end up destroying
[1:20:58] them but there was more to the prophecy
[1:21:00] in isaiah 10 12 wherefore it shall come
[1:21:01] to pass when the lord hath performed his
[1:21:03] whole work i love that don't give up
[1:21:06] until the lord has performed his entire
[1:21:08] work
[1:21:09] upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will
[1:21:12] punish the fruit of the stout heart of
[1:21:13] the king of assyria in the glory of his
[1:21:15] high looks therefore thus saith the lord
[1:21:17] god of host o my people that dwelleth in
[1:21:19] zion be not afraid of the assyrian
[1:21:22] now what did the prophet do in our day
[1:21:24] i could bring you the quotes but you
[1:21:26] know what he said don't fear russia
[1:21:28] don't be afraid of communism don't be
[1:21:30] afraid of the assyrian isaiah said see
[1:21:33] god's been doing that speaking through
[1:21:34] prophets for thousands of years it'd do
[1:21:37] us well to take heed to him and listen
[1:21:40] amen he said be not afraid of the
[1:21:42] assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod
[1:21:44] and shall lift up his staff against thee
[1:21:46] after the manner of egypt
[1:21:48] for yet a very little while and the
[1:21:50] indignation shall cease and mine anger
[1:21:52] and their destruction and the lord of
[1:21:54] hosts shall stir up a scourge for him he
[1:21:56] said judgment's coming to him
[1:21:58] according to the slaughter of million at
[1:21:59] the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon
[1:22:02] the sea so shall he lift it up after the
[1:22:04] manner of egypt and it shall come to
[1:22:06] pass in that day
[1:22:08] his burden should be taken away from off
[1:22:10] thy shoulder and his yoke from authentic
[1:22:13] and the yoke shall be destroyed
[1:22:15] not because
[1:22:17] of your natural ability to withstand him
[1:22:20] but because of the
[1:22:22] anointing oh god i hope we can
[1:22:25] understand this in a spiritual way
[1:22:26] tonight
[1:22:28] yoke is not destroyed because you
[1:22:30] realize that all these other nations or
[1:22:32] maybe other churches
[1:22:34] you say well they're doing wrong and so
[1:22:36] in my natural ability i'm going to go
[1:22:37] out there and i'm going to defeat these
[1:22:39] other things that are wrong you'll find
[1:22:41] that you end up just like jonah
[1:22:43] in the permissive will of god
[1:22:45] but now what did he say the yoke will
[1:22:48] not be destroyed by some man going out
[1:22:50] there and and preaching at it the yoke
[1:22:52] will be destroyed because of the
[1:22:53] anointing when god says it's time it'll
[1:22:55] be time
[1:22:57] amen when god says it's time for freedom
[1:22:59] that'll be the time
[1:23:01] see we don't do things in a political
[1:23:02] way many times we think well if we could
[1:23:04] get together and and
[1:23:06] we could join together we could we we
[1:23:07] could vote and we could make the church
[1:23:09] different we could do this differently
[1:23:10] we could do that differently but that's
[1:23:11] not what god does see i'm not worried
[1:23:13] about you saying are you worried about
[1:23:15] coven are you worried some people never
[1:23:16] come back i'm not worried about that i
[1:23:18] believe that god's people go to church
[1:23:20] but i'm not worried about that but i
[1:23:22] it's important that we don't get bogged
[1:23:24] down i have to be careful to not get
[1:23:26] bogged down as a pastor in the minute
[1:23:28] details of what's happening right now
[1:23:30] because there's a bigger picture the
[1:23:32] yoke will be destroyed because of the
[1:23:34] anointing if there's a down time there
[1:23:36] will be an uptime if there's a valley
[1:23:37] there'll be a mountain are you with me
[1:23:39] now church if there's a revival there'll
[1:23:41] be a desert but that desert we dig
[1:23:43] ditches right we learn that we dig
[1:23:45] ditches in the desert to get ready for
[1:23:47] another revival
[1:23:49] it's just it's just the nature of life
[1:23:51] it's just the way it is
[1:23:53] amen so isaiah understands the big
[1:23:55] picture that jonah doesn't seem to
[1:23:58] see god may have you preached to your
[1:24:00] enemies
[1:24:01] and his
[1:24:03] and bless them before he destroys them
[1:24:10] that's not the way we like to handle
[1:24:12] things is it
[1:24:13] bless god you touch my property i'll
[1:24:15] take you to court
[1:24:19] i know how we are here in arkansas
[1:24:22] i know how i am
[1:24:24] blessed god you mess with me
[1:24:27] i'll see that everybody knows about it
[1:24:29] maybe god wants to use you to preach
[1:24:32] grace
[1:24:36] to them to your enemies
[1:24:38] to people who maybe won't receive it or
[1:24:40] will only receive it for a time and then
[1:24:41] backslide
[1:24:43] because he just wants to
[1:24:46] he wants to show something new see what
[1:24:48] god really wanted to do was show
[1:24:49] something in jonah
[1:24:52] are you are you with me he wanted to
[1:24:53] give jonah you want to make jonah a sign
[1:24:55] of the resurrection how is he going to
[1:24:57] do that by sending him to preach grace
[1:24:58] to his enemies
[1:25:01] oh god
[1:25:02] help us today
[1:25:04] i've got just a few more minutes and you
[1:25:06] hang with me
[1:25:08] well if we can stop it i can pick it up
[1:25:10] next wednesday night
[1:25:11] now jonah 1-1 let's look at it
[1:25:15] it says now the word of the lord came
[1:25:16] unto jonah the son of imitate saying
[1:25:19] now this is not the first time jonah
[1:25:21] prophesied we'll go back maybe next week
[1:25:22] and pick up
[1:25:24] the first time what made jonah famous
[1:25:25] was a prophecy actually against the
[1:25:27] assyrians
[1:25:29] that actually expanded the borders of of
[1:25:31] israel
[1:25:32] and he was a very famous during that
[1:25:34] time for that reason verse two he said
[1:25:36] arise go to nineveh
[1:25:38] that great city and cry against it
[1:25:42] for their wickedness has come up
[1:25:44] before me
[1:25:46] it's their time
[1:25:49] now we heard that and i'm going back to
[1:25:52] the the book that i read for just a
[1:25:54] moment if you'll just bear with me
[1:25:56] but jonah's heart beat high with hope
[1:25:58] that nineveh was now so near her
[1:26:00] destruction
[1:26:02] and if only all possibility of her
[1:26:04] repentance and reformation could be kept
[1:26:06] back from nineveh for 40 days
[1:26:09] he just had to keep it from him for 40
[1:26:12] days
[1:26:14] you wonder why he went to tarshish
[1:26:16] he was just going far enough away
[1:26:19] out of the way where he couldn't get to
[1:26:21] nineveh in time
[1:26:25] think about it
[1:26:27] say well i just went the long route
[1:26:30] lord i was going just with the long
[1:26:32] route
[1:26:34] but he wanted
[1:26:35] the 40 days to be up before he showed up
[1:26:38] because he knew how merciful god was
[1:26:43] now watch
[1:26:44] he said then all might be well with
[1:26:47] jonah and with his four doomed people so
[1:26:49] in other words if if nineveh was
[1:26:50] destroyed that's great for israel
[1:26:53] but with such a god as his god was
[1:26:55] stoner had no security
[1:26:58] oh my
[1:27:00] with a god so given to mercy
[1:27:02] at the first sign of repentance in a
[1:27:04] sinner
[1:27:05] jonah felt that israel was not safe till
[1:27:07] nineveh was completely destroyed and
[1:27:10] forever blotted out
[1:27:11] so he says if i go and preach that to
[1:27:13] them if i go and warn them if i alarm
[1:27:15] them if they repent and turn them to god
[1:27:17] then it were better i were dead
[1:27:19] perish my prophets place perish the
[1:27:21] presence of god and all rather than that
[1:27:23] i should take a single step to preach
[1:27:25] repentance to nineveh so jonah becomes a
[1:27:27] prophet who flees from the presence of
[1:27:29] god
[1:27:33] i've seen pastors do this
[1:27:35] i've seen church members do this
[1:27:39] they begin they shut themselves up
[1:27:42] they flee from the presence of god they
[1:27:44] don't show up at meetings anymore
[1:27:46] they don't come they don't come to the
[1:27:48] house of god anymore they're setting
[1:27:50] themselves up
[1:27:51] in the hopes that their enemies will be
[1:27:53] destroyed
[1:27:56] not realizing that god may want to use
[1:27:58] them
[1:27:59] as the method not of the enemy's
[1:28:01] destruction but of mercy to the enemies
[1:28:04] see god would have a prophet later that
[1:28:06] would preach nineveh's destruction named
[1:28:08] nahum he would have a prophet that would
[1:28:10] preach of the destruction of nineveh but
[1:28:12] jonah wasn't that prophet jonah would
[1:28:14] preach repent in 40 days it was a hard
[1:28:17] message in 40 days you'll be destroyed
[1:28:19] but it was during jonah's time it was
[1:28:21] meant for them to repent
[1:28:25] so they could be around
[1:28:27] to go smite israel
[1:28:33] god knows what he's doing
[1:28:36] he just doesn't always do what we want
[1:28:37] him to do
[1:28:42] god would want to use you to help heal a
[1:28:44] person
[1:28:45] i can't tell you how many times i've
[1:28:47] prayed for people in my life
[1:28:50] that i knew they were
[1:28:51] they weren't for me
[1:28:54] i knew that the first opportunity that
[1:28:55] they would get
[1:28:57] they would try to do something to hurt
[1:28:58] me or hurt my family
[1:29:01] and yet you pray for them as sincerely
[1:29:02] as you do anybody else
[1:29:05] god may want
[1:29:07] them to be healed
[1:29:09] just so they can be around long enough
[1:29:11] to hurt you
[1:29:16] that's
[1:29:17] that's stuff we don't want to think
[1:29:19] about it is it
[1:29:21] that's that was nineveh
[1:29:24] god may want to use you to provide
[1:29:26] healing and repentance to someone just
[1:29:28] so they'll be around long enough to come
[1:29:30] and stab you in the back later but it
[1:29:32] doesn't matter if it's in the perfect
[1:29:33] will of god
[1:29:36] and at some point in our lives we have
[1:29:38] to surrender ourselves and say lord if
[1:29:40] it's your perfect will that's what i
[1:29:42] want
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:48] when you shut up to choose between
[1:29:49] preaching in nineveh
[1:29:51] or making his bed in the belly of hell
[1:29:55] it displeased jonah exceedingly he was
[1:29:57] very angry
[1:29:59] and he chose to go to the belly
[1:30:01] of hell
[1:30:03] he knew god would come after him but he
[1:30:06] did not want nineveh to repent
[1:30:09] you say that's bad of jonah but i want
[1:30:10] you to kind of sympathize with him what
[1:30:12] if we were sent to russia and the nation
[1:30:15] repented
[1:30:17] just long enough to send nuclear war on
[1:30:20] this country
[1:30:22] to save them long enough to destroy us
[1:30:26] that's basically what happened
[1:30:29] with nineveh
[1:30:31] see
[1:30:33] it displeased jonah exceedingly that the
[1:30:35] lord had not destroyed it were you still
[1:30:36] with me tonight
[1:30:38] and and he was very angry
[1:30:40] and
[1:30:41] sometimes that happens and i'm following
[1:30:44] this line of thinking now
[1:30:45] not only between contending and
[1:30:47] competing nations but between contending
[1:30:49] and competing churches now we're going
[1:30:51] to bring it a little closer to home
[1:30:54] sometimes we hear
[1:30:56] like jonah that another church is
[1:30:58] prospering
[1:31:01] and
[1:31:02] we hear that another church or another
[1:31:04] church hears that we are doing well and
[1:31:06] it's not good news
[1:31:09] boy i'm getting somewhere tonight we're
[1:31:11] just digging deep amen
[1:31:16] i've preached long enough that i love it
[1:31:18] when it gets real quiet
[1:31:25] that's the difference by the way the
[1:31:26] only difference in a preacher has been
[1:31:28] preaching a long time one's been
[1:31:29] preaching a short time is a preacher's
[1:31:30] been preaching a long time loves it when
[1:31:32] it gets real quiet not all the time but
[1:31:34] just
[1:31:35] when you hit when you hit on something
[1:31:41] we hear that another church is doing
[1:31:42] well on the mission field
[1:31:46] we're we hear that another church and
[1:31:48] i'm paraphrasing this but this is the
[1:31:50] thought that again that this man had in
[1:31:52] the book that i read and i just before
[1:31:54] we move on i just wanted to kind of
[1:31:56] dwell on this for a moment
[1:31:58] but now
[1:32:00] you know it gets to the place where it
[1:32:01] would be better for the heathen to
[1:32:03] perish
[1:32:04] than that
[1:32:06] another church would be prosperous in
[1:32:07] the mission field
[1:32:12] because we got a problem with said
[1:32:14] church or said preacher and we would
[1:32:16] rather that the heathen perish
[1:32:19] then they be prosperous
[1:32:21] so we run from the presence of god i
[1:32:23] know preachers like that
[1:32:25] god help me not to be one of them
[1:32:27] i will say the temptation is there
[1:32:30] sometimes i look at what everybody else
[1:32:32] does and discount it
[1:32:35] say well they they are against me they
[1:32:37] must not be doing anything for god
[1:32:39] but that's not the attitude that jesus
[1:32:41] had at all
[1:32:43] see jonah still gets angry
[1:32:46] he never forgives you if you have any
[1:32:48] good to say of any other church than his
[1:32:50] own
[1:32:51] or of any party in his own church than
[1:32:53] his own party
[1:32:55] till you come down to this if you have
[1:32:56] any good to say of any man
[1:32:58] but himself
[1:33:06] what if the song leader
[1:33:09] or the deacon
[1:33:11] or the sunday school teacher
[1:33:13] or the pastor
[1:33:14] or the evangelist that replaces you
[1:33:17] does well what do you do with it
[1:33:22] think about it
[1:33:24] what if somebody goes someplace that you
[1:33:26] went and does better than you did
[1:33:30] do we have enough of the spirit of
[1:33:31] christ that we can say lord
[1:33:33] your work's being done
[1:33:37] it might be difficult for me but your
[1:33:38] work's being done this is especially
[1:33:40] hard on pastors as they get older i've
[1:33:43] watched this because it becomes more of
[1:33:44] a i can't do what i used to do and i'm
[1:33:47] afraid that i'm going to lose my
[1:33:48] position because now i see that younger
[1:33:51] men are coming along i say god send them
[1:33:54] god send them if they can send them from
[1:33:56] my position to where i can go back to
[1:33:58] work praise god
[1:34:01] and i'm trying to be honest as i can
[1:34:03] about that
[1:34:04] yes it would hurt
[1:34:06] but if god wants it let that i want that
[1:34:09] to be the perfect will of god
[1:34:11] amen
[1:34:12] i want brother joel with allen by the
[1:34:14] steward and though alan and steward are
[1:34:16] not younger than me
[1:34:17] really and not much less experienced in
[1:34:20] many ways but
[1:34:22] but they're they're not
[1:34:23] inferior in any way i don't believe in
[1:34:25] their preaching but yet god called me to
[1:34:27] this place in this position but if they
[1:34:29] come from my my office if god wills it
[1:34:32] praise god
[1:34:34] are you with me now
[1:34:36] i'm being really personal with this but
[1:34:38] think about it your job what you do in
[1:34:40] the church well bless god i used to do
[1:34:42] the cleaning and somebody else does it i
[1:34:44] used to used to do the video and
[1:34:46] somebody else does that i used to do
[1:34:47] this and somebody else does it and we
[1:34:49] grudgingly we look at that and say well
[1:34:51] if they do well am i going to be able to
[1:34:52] be happy about that we should be
[1:34:57] but see jonah was so unhappy
[1:34:59] because he was afraid god would forgive
[1:35:01] them
[1:35:02] that he rose up to flee into tarshish
[1:35:05] from the presence
[1:35:06] of the lord
[1:35:07] and went down to joplin he found a ship
[1:35:10] going to tarshish tarshish so he paid
[1:35:12] the fair thereof and went down
[1:35:14] into it to go with them unto tarshish
[1:35:16] from the presence
[1:35:17] of the lord he would rather run
[1:35:19] from the presence of god than see
[1:35:21] nineveh repent
[1:35:23] but again the sovereign god who sees all
[1:35:26] things who owns all things doesn't care
[1:35:28] about our personal grudges
[1:35:30] about our petty differences he might
[1:35:32] bless the person who hates you save the
[1:35:34] person who you despise
[1:35:41] let me read this and we'll close
[1:35:43] musicians go ahead and come
[1:35:45] we've got lots of notes left but we'll
[1:35:47] pick it up
[1:35:48] next wednesday
[1:35:50] he said you've heard that has been said
[1:35:52] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:35:53] thine enemy i say unto you love your
[1:35:55] enemies
[1:35:56] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:35:58] them that hates you pray for them which
[1:35:59] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:36:02] that you may be the children of your
[1:36:03] father which is in heaven for he makes
[1:36:05] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:36:08] good
[1:36:08] and sends rain on the just
[1:36:11] and on the unjust
[1:36:14] do we really believe that
[1:36:16] he sends rain on the evil and on the
[1:36:18] good equally
[1:36:21] and we know that because he's been
[1:36:22] sending rain on jonesboro
[1:36:29] we've been sending rain on memphis and
[1:36:31] something we've missed out on
[1:36:33] but we'll get some too
[1:36:35] he sends rain on the just and the unjust
[1:36:38] people who you've had personal problems
[1:36:40] with sometimes will come to church here
[1:36:42] at meetings that we hold
[1:36:45] i don't this didn't happen okay just
[1:36:47] it's hypothetical
[1:36:49] but people you have a personal grudge
[1:36:51] against might come and be blessed at a
[1:36:53] meeting that you worked to put on
[1:36:56] what are you going to do with that lord
[1:36:57] it's in your hands
[1:37:00] he sends rain on the evil and on the
[1:37:02] good on the elect and the non-elect on
[1:37:04] the just and the unjust and sometimes he
[1:37:06] uses us
[1:37:08] to bring the water
[1:37:10] to bring the rain
[1:37:12] on people that hate us
[1:37:15] god elijah prophesied rain he brought
[1:37:19] the drought and then he brought the rain
[1:37:21] god used elijah to prophesy the rain
[1:37:23] that would come to ahab to save his neck
[1:37:27] and keep him his king
[1:37:29] and elijah went off in the wilderness
[1:37:31] sat under a juniper tree
[1:37:33] and felt sorry for himself
[1:37:35] until god got a hold of him comforting
[1:37:37] him for a while and they said you're not
[1:37:39] the only one
[1:37:42] there's more out there could we bow our
[1:37:44] heads together i didn't intend for this
[1:37:45] to end this way we had some really good
[1:37:49] things ahead but i can't keep going
[1:37:56] maybe just as a little preview you know
[1:37:59] brother branham was almost jonah
[1:38:03] he said i wanted to go up into the
[1:38:04] wilderness
[1:38:06] be a man a manly man be a real prophet
[1:38:10] god said you're not that kind of prophet
[1:38:14] he said you need to get the heart for
[1:38:16] the people again
[1:38:18] i wonder if that's us in whatever
[1:38:19] position that we hold whether you're
[1:38:21] watching tonight or whether you're here
[1:38:23] maybe you just need to have a heart for
[1:38:24] the people again
[1:38:25] say god help me to be that way
[1:38:28] don't let me be like joan and run from
[1:38:29] the presence of the lord but in this age
[1:38:31] i want to be in your perfect will oh god
[1:38:34] god didn't let brother branham fall into
[1:38:36] that permissive will and just be a
[1:38:37] prophet in the wilderness he he brought
[1:38:40] him back to the people
[1:38:42] god help us to do that
[1:38:44] amen heavenly father
[1:38:48] as i feel your presence here tonight and
[1:38:51] conviction as well
[1:38:53] lord not conviction so much for the
[1:38:55] people but for me
[1:38:58] lord we want others to do good when they
[1:39:00] do us good
[1:39:02] but sometimes you want others to do good
[1:39:04] who will do us harm
[1:39:06] not only who have done us harm but who
[1:39:08] will do us harm
[1:39:11] we don't understand that lord but it
[1:39:13] fits in your providence and your purpose
[1:39:16] help us to surrender to that lord
[1:39:20] we don't know what tomorrow holds but
[1:39:21] you do
[1:39:24] help us to rest in the assurance that we
[1:39:26] are your elect
[1:39:28] that somehow you'll get us out of the
[1:39:30] messes that we create in life
[1:39:33] oh god many times i've created messes
[1:39:35] even by my own words and my own actions
[1:39:38] but lord somehow you turned it for your
[1:39:40] own benefit
[1:39:42] lord somehow you
[1:39:44] in your book it's written that i'm a
[1:39:47] virtuous bride
[1:39:48] clean
[1:39:50] not spotted by the things of the world a
[1:39:52] bride who will not fall
[1:39:54] remember that bride today i pray you'd
[1:39:56] help these people to realize that lord
[1:39:59] each one of them lord is a member of
[1:40:00] that bride that will not fall
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:04] sometimes lord as we go through life
[1:40:07] god wants us to speak to that person who
[1:40:09] may be non-elect
[1:40:11] who may hurt us and have hurt us in the
[1:40:14] past or
[1:40:15] will hurt us in the future
[1:40:17] but through us he wants to provide
[1:40:18] healing to them i pray we would be
[1:40:20] submissive to that lord and we just let
[1:40:22] it be
[1:40:24] you have a way of bringing out of that
[1:40:26] what you want it to be i pray you grant
[1:40:28] it lord
[1:40:29] before you help these people maybe maybe
[1:40:31] there's some here have been heard in the
[1:40:33] past by
[1:40:34] things that have been wrong but lord
[1:40:36] sometimes you want to use us
[1:40:38] to help those very people who hurt us
[1:40:42] you did that lord that was your
[1:40:43] character
[1:40:45] you wanted to show that display that
[1:40:47] jonah but jonah ran
[1:40:49] but you showed there would be
[1:40:51] one who would not run
[1:40:54] but he would say not my will
[1:40:56] but time be done
[1:40:59] and he would be raised
[1:41:00] on the third day
[1:41:03] though he was put to death
[1:41:05] by wicked hands
[1:41:08] oh god
[1:41:09] we're so grateful for that today lord
[1:41:11] so grateful that though you were put to
[1:41:13] death by wicked hands
[1:41:15] yet you
[1:41:17] did not run
[1:41:18] but you rose again on the third day
[1:41:21] and showed the the reality of what jonah
[1:41:23] was in type
[1:41:25] we had a prophet in this day who did not
[1:41:27] run
[1:41:28] but he stayed where you in his position
[1:41:32] come back to the people and preach
[1:41:34] the opening of the word we're so
[1:41:35] grateful for that lord
[1:41:37] i pray you'd help us to be a people like
[1:41:39] that you stay in our position don't run
[1:41:43] recognize we're the predestined children
[1:41:45] of god but that doesn't make us
[1:41:47] lord just something special or different
[1:41:50] but it makes us responsible
[1:41:52] to the world that we live and i pray
[1:41:54] grant it now bless these people heal
