[29:01] lead you that way. God bless our
[29:03] singers. Give our singers a nice hand

[35:01] [Music]
[35:29] I left a barren land,
[35:33] searching for rest, stumbling round in
[35:38] amnesia,
[35:40] bitterness and distress. But then I met
[35:44] the kinsman redeemer who's called the
[35:48] mighty one. He took this old Moabitete
[35:52] from the field and brought me to his
[35:56] house.
[35:58] And he said, "Fear not my child, for you
[36:04] are a part of me and I'll not rest till
[36:09] you are at my side.
[36:14] I will do all that you'd
[36:17] [Music]
[36:18] ask of me your jewel in my eyes.
[36:24] Virtuous woman,
[36:27] you are my bride.
[36:42] I've responded to your call
[36:46] and you have covered me. For with eyes
[36:51] of faith I see
[36:53] all the mysteries being revealed. And
[36:57] now I see who I am. And I lay claim to
[37:02] all that's mine. I'm the lamb's wife.
[37:08] I've been bought with a price.
[37:12] And he said, "Fear not, my child, for
[37:17] you are a part of me, and I'll not rest
[37:22] till you are at my side.
[37:27] I will do all that you
[37:32] ask for me. Virtue in my eyes.
[37:37] Virtuous woman,
[37:40] you are my bride.
[37:43] [Music]
[37:49] When I look back and see
[37:52] how much grace and love you've shown me,
[37:56] Lord, it brings me to my knees
[37:59] that you would even think about me.
[38:04] You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're still
[38:08] the greater
[38:10] and with faith I'll stand on your word
[38:14] because you're more than able.
[38:18] He said, "Fear not, my child for you are
[38:24] a part of me and I'll not rest till you
[38:29] are at my side.
[38:33] I will do all that you
[38:38] ask of me. Your virtual in my eyes,
[38:43] virtuous woman,
[38:47] you are my right.
[38:52] And so I'm casting all my cares on you,
[38:59] Lord. I know that you love me.
[39:05] Oh, redemption by the love.
[39:12] That's the greatest love story
[39:20] for restoration,
[39:24] for redemption.
[39:26] That's what seven angels in a cloud
[39:30] testify.
[39:33] My redeemer's no longer dead.
[39:37] He's alive
[39:40] and he's coming back for you.
[39:46] And so I'm casting all my cares on you.
[39:51] [Music]
[39:52] Oh, I know that you love me.
[39:56] [Music]
[39:59] Wo redemption by blood.
[40:06] That's the greatest love story
[40:13] for restoration
[40:16] [Music]
[40:17] for redemption.
[40:19] Last once seven angels in a cloud
[40:24] testify,
[40:26] my redeemer's no longer dead.
[40:30] He's alive
[40:33] and he's coming back for you and me.
[40:36] [Music]
[40:42] enjoy
[40:48] those specials this morning and we know
[40:51] that song God will make the way here but
[40:55] let's stand together.
[40:57] How many's ready for the word of the
[40:58] Lord this morning?
[41:01] How many knows you get what you expect?
[41:03] So this prophet taught us that you get
[41:05] what you expect. If you come looking for
[41:07] something to criticize, you will find
[41:09] something to criticize this morning. If
[41:11] you come looking for something we do
[41:12] wrong, I'm sure we'll find something
[41:13] we've done wrong. But I can tell you
[41:15] this, if you're looking for God to come
[41:16] and move, I know he can come and move in
[41:19] your situation this morning. Are you
[41:21] ready for the word this morning? And
[41:23] then as our pastor comes, God will make
[41:24] a way.
[41:26] God will make a way.
[41:32] Where there seems to be the way,
[41:39] he works in ways
[41:42] we cannot see.
[41:46] He will make a way for me.
[41:52] Oh, he will be my guide.
[41:58] Hold me close to his side
[42:05] with love and strength
[42:08] for each new day.
[42:12] He will make a way.
[42:16] [Music]
[42:18] He will make
[42:21] Oh, sing it again with all your hearts
[42:23] now. I know that God made a way. Yes, he
[42:29] will. Where there seems to be
[42:34] the way,
[42:38] he works in ways
[42:41] we cannot. You believe that this morning
[42:44] we will make a way
[42:49] [Music]
[43:03] with love and strength
[43:07] for each new day.
[43:10] Oh, he will make the way.
[43:16] Oh, he will make a way. If you believe
[43:20] that, let's sing it again. Oh, I know my
[43:23] God will make a way
[43:29] when there seems to be
[43:32] no way. Aren't you glad he's that kind
[43:35] of God? He works in ways
[43:39] we cannot see. Oh, he will make the way
[43:46] for me.
[43:48] Oh, he will be my God.
[43:55] Hold me closely to
[43:58] his side.
[44:01] home with love and strength
[44:05] for each new day.
[44:08] Oh, he will make
[44:11] the way.
[44:14] Oh, he will make it go away.
[44:20] Would you bow your heads with me for a
[44:21] moment? Maybe there's someone who'd like
[44:23] to make a prayer request known by way of
[44:26] uplifted hand. God knows every need. He
[44:29] sees every heart. He knows every family
[44:31] and what you're struggling with. And he
[44:33] knows all about your trouble. But he
[44:36] said, "Come unto me all ye that are
[44:39] weary and heavy laden, and I will give
[44:41] you rest." I believe you can do that
[44:43] this morning. Heavenly Father, we
[44:45] approach your throne today, Lord,
[44:48] believing that you're a great high
[44:50] priest who can be touched by the feeling
[44:53] of our infirmities.
[44:55] Oh God, I pray that you would just move
[44:58] in in a mighty way today. Lord, if
[45:00] there's one here that's unlike you,
[45:02] Lord, in any way, if it's me, oh God, I
[45:05] pray you'd take everything out of me
[45:06] that's unlike you, I pray you'd make us
[45:09] mold us into your image today, God.
[45:12] Lord, if there's a sinner that needs to
[45:14] be saved, I pray that your grace would
[45:16] reach down to them today. If there's a
[45:19] Christian, Lord, maybe not living the
[45:21] right kind of a life and uh some kind of
[45:23] besetting sin. Lord, you're able to
[45:25] remove that from their life today. Lord,
[45:28] maybe there would be a person that's
[45:30] sick and body this morning. Lord, we
[45:32] believe that you're our healer. I pray
[45:34] you would meet that need today. Lord,
[45:36] for these upraised hands, I pray God
[45:39] that you would count that as a sign of
[45:41] surrender today. That you would come,
[45:43] Lord, and meet those needs, Lord. We
[45:46] don't know what they are, but you do.
[45:47] it. So I pray you'd move me out of the
[45:49] way and speak directly to your people.
[45:52] We pray and we pray that you'd grant it
[45:54] now in Jesus name. Amen.
[45:57] Amen. Thank the Lord.
[46:01] Amen. Isn't he good to us this morning?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good all the time. It's
[46:06] good to have each and every one of you
[46:08] with us. We got most of the folks here
[46:10] this morning. Maybe a few missing, but
[46:12] glad to see you this morning. and I I uh
[46:15] hadn't preached uh in a in a week or two
[46:19] and and uh so good to see everybody. I
[46:22] take my glasses off. I can't see the
[46:23] people in the back, but it's good to
[46:24] have you here too, each one of you. And
[46:27] we just pray the Lord just give us a
[46:29] special blessing this morning. Matthew
[46:32] chapter 17 and verse 1. Matthew chapter
[46:35] 17:es 1-5.
[46:40] got a little bit of a cold today. So,
[46:42] just bear with me. Uh, and then
[46:46] I've got something that I want to to say
[46:48] today. It's on my heart, but I just just
[46:51] try to listen and pay attention this
[46:54] morning if you can and stir up your
[46:56] spiritual conscience this morning and
[46:58] believe the Lord has something he wants
[47:00] to say to us. Matthew chapter 17 verse
[47:02] one. And after six days Jesus taketh
[47:05] Peter, James, and John his brother, and
[47:08] bringeth them up into a high mount
[47:10] mountain apart, and was transfigured
[47:12] before them, and his face did shine as
[47:14] the sun, and his raignment was white as
[47:17] the light. And behold, there appeared
[47:20] unto them Moses and Elias talking with
[47:22] him. And then answered Peter, and said
[47:26] unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to
[47:28] be here. If thou wilt, let us make here
[47:30] three tabernacles, one for thee, and one
[47:33] for Moses, and one for Elias. And while
[47:37] he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud
[47:40] overshadowed them. And behold, a voice
[47:43] out of the cloud, which said, "This is
[47:47] my beloved son, in whom I am well
[47:50] pleased. Hear ye him." I'd like to speak
[47:54] this morning on hear ye him the
[47:57] manifested word, the word made flesh.
[48:00] You may be seated.
[48:03] Here ye him, the word made flesh. Who is
[48:08] Jesus?
[48:09] Our attitude toward him is the
[48:12] difference in how we live and how we
[48:15] die. It's the difference in our future
[48:19] and whether we go to heaven or not,
[48:21] whether we live eternally or not. Our
[48:24] attitude toward him is all important.
[48:27] When he was on the earth, uh Jesus
[48:30] actually uh asked his disciples, he
[48:33] said, "Who do men say that I am?" And it
[48:37] may have been the first public opinion
[48:38] poll that Jesus was asking them, "What's
[48:41] the consensus of people about who I am?"
[48:44] them and they said, "Well, there's all
[48:45] kinds of theories about who you are.
[48:48] Some say that you're a prophet. Some say
[48:50] that you're Elijah. Some say that you're
[48:52] a good man. Some say that you're a
[48:54] teacher. Some say you're this, that, or
[48:56] the other." But then he he asked them a
[48:59] more personal question. He said, "Who do
[49:02] you say that I am?"
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And when you ask them that, they begin
[49:07] uh, you know, to maybe look among
[49:08] themselves. And Peter, as he almost
[49:11] always had an answer, right or wrong,
[49:13] but Peter spoke up and he said, he said,
[49:15] "Thou art the Christ,
[49:17] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God." And Jesus
[49:20] looked at him and he said, "Flesh and
[49:22] blood has not revealed this to you." He
[49:24] said, "But my father which is in
[49:27] heaven." So your attitude towards him is
[49:30] the result of a spiritual revelation
[49:33] that he's given to you. As I've told you
[49:35] recently, some people never experience a
[49:38] consciousness of God. They don't know
[49:40] what it's like to come into the presence
[49:42] of God at all. They don't know what it's
[49:43] like to have uh his hand in their life.
[49:46] They never wonder about eternal life.
[49:48] They don't they don't question things.
[49:50] And so, they just go on living their
[49:52] life. But why did you have that
[49:54] question? Why did you wonder who he was?
[49:57] And why did you come to the conclusion
[49:59] that he is the son of the living God?
[50:01] because the father revealed that to you.
[50:04] It had to be a revelation from God or
[50:06] you wouldn't have been here this
[50:07] morning. That ought to give us courage.
[50:09] No matter what else is happening in our
[50:11] life, no matter what else is going on, I
[50:13] the father has given me a revelation. It
[50:16] it belongs to me. I know who he is.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you can know who he is
[50:22] this morning?
[50:23] &gt;&gt; It's good to know who the president is
[50:26] and good to know who the senators are
[50:28] and all the political people. It's good
[50:29] to know who your pastor is. It's good to
[50:31] know what church you go to. But the most
[50:33] important thing that you ought to know
[50:35] is who he is this morning.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; That's the allimp important question. Is
[50:41] he a historical figure? Is he a legend
[50:45] or a myth? Is he a good teacher?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Is he a good luck charm as so many
[50:50] people make him today? Just coffee in
[50:53] Jesus, you know?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Just something to to have to hold on to
[50:57] when you need him. All right.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, he is he is he is a good teacher. He
[51:02] is a historical figure,
[51:05] &gt;&gt; but he's also so much more than that.
[51:06] He's God in flesh.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Is he just a convenience when we need
[51:12] him
[51:13] or is he what he claimed to be the word
[51:18] made flesh? And I want to be very clear
[51:20] about what we're saying when we say that
[51:22] the word made flesh is the Bible
[51:25] walking.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Right. It's the Bible becoming the words
[51:29] that were written in the Old Testament
[51:32] becoming literal flesh so that when you
[51:35] looked at the Old Testament, you could
[51:37] predict who Jesus was and how he would
[51:40] be born and what he would do and even
[51:43] the manner of how he would do it and
[51:45] everything about it. Now, you couldn't
[51:47] just predict that from uh from a natural
[51:50] mind, but if you had a spiritual insight
[51:52] to see and you begin to see it walk in
[51:55] front of you, it would be revealed to
[51:57] you who Jesus was. To me, he is today
[52:00] the word made flesh.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still the same God as he was
[52:05] back then.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; We know the entire Old Testament spoke
[52:09] of him. We we see an example in Genesis
[52:11] 12:3. We know he is the blessing to
[52:14] Abraham's seed. He said, "I will bless
[52:16] them that bless thee, and curse him that
[52:18] cursseeth thee, and in thee shall all
[52:20] families of the earth be blessed." Peter
[52:23] identifies that scripture fulfilled in
[52:25] Christ in Acts 3:25. He said, "You are
[52:27] the children of the prophets and of the
[52:29] covenant which God made with our father,
[52:31] saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed
[52:34] shall all the kindreds of the earth be
[52:35] blessed unto you first, God, having
[52:38] raised up his son Jesus, sent him to
[52:40] bless you in turning away every one of
[52:42] you from his iniquities." So God
[52:44] fulfilled his word in Christ. I will
[52:47] bless him that blesses you. He fulfilled
[52:49] his word. In thee shall all families of
[52:52] the earth be blessed in literally in
[52:54] Christ. He is Emmanuel born of a virgin
[52:57] in Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14 if
[52:59] you're writing these down.
[53:02] A prophet Isaiah 400 years before the
[53:04] birth of Jesus or 700 years rather
[53:06] before the birth of Jesus he cried out
[53:09] and said therefore he said the Lord
[53:11] himself shall give you a sign. He said,
[53:13] "Behold, a virgin shall conceive
[53:16] &gt;&gt; and bear a son and shall call his name
[53:19] Emmanuel."
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel. What was that? When he was
[53:23] born, he was God. He was Emmanuel.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; He was the woman's seed who crushed the
[53:28] head of the serpent. In Genesis 3:15, he
[53:31] said, "I will put enmity between thee
[53:33] and the woman. Between thy seed and her
[53:34] seed, it shall bruise thy head, and thou
[53:37] shalt bruise his heel." That word bruise
[53:39] is to crush. He is the seed of the woman
[53:43] who would crush the head of the serpent
[53:45] on Calvary. He was the teacher of
[53:47] parables prophesied by David in the
[53:50] Psalms in Matthew 13:34. All these
[53:52] things spake Jesus unto the multitude in
[53:54] parables without a parable, speaking not
[53:56] unto them, that it might be fulfilled
[53:59] which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
[54:01] I will open my mouth in parables. I will
[54:03] utter things which have been kept secret
[54:06] from the foundational world. As we're
[54:07] going through this, I'm not just you
[54:09] say, "Well, I know this, brother Ben,
[54:10] but ought to give you confidence today."
[54:12] If he was exactly the word, then he
[54:15] still is the word today. And whatever he
[54:18] promised in the word is is what you are.
[54:21] If he was the word for his day, and you
[54:23] become the word for your day, then you
[54:25] can be and do whatever the word says you
[54:27] can be and do. And what that does is it
[54:30] releases you from your past. It releases
[54:32] you from your mistakes. It releases you
[54:35] from whatever you were before you come
[54:37] to him because once listen the woman at
[54:39] the well had lived an awful kind of a
[54:41] life. She had five husbands and the one
[54:43] she was living with wasn't she wasn't
[54:44] married to and but he came to her and
[54:46] what did he do once she realized who he
[54:49] was and she said you are the Christ and
[54:51] she said come see a man who told me all
[54:53] that had ever done. What was it? It
[54:55] changed her history because now she
[54:57] could begin to become what the word said
[55:00] she was instead of what the people said
[55:02] she was. She was no longer defined. Oh,
[55:05] come on, church. Defined by what she the
[55:07] way she had lived and the way she had
[55:09] Oh, God. She was no longer defined by
[55:11] what she had been, but she was now. She
[55:14] was now what the word says she was. How
[55:17] could you rejoice in that this morning?
[55:19] I am not a a sum of my mistakes. I am
[55:22] not what I was before I met him, but
[55:24] once I met him, I've become the word
[55:27] made flesh.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:33] Oh, that ought to give you confidence. I
[55:35] know you'll have ups and downs and
[55:36] sometimes you struggle and sometimes you
[55:38] worry and sometimes you think, "Am I
[55:40] really?" But when you met him, you
[55:42] changed.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; And you could not have changed unless
[55:45] that word was going to be made flesh in
[55:47] you.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; He is.
[55:57] Oh, what is he to you this morning? Yes,
[56:00] &gt;&gt; he is the one who has spoken of in
[56:02] Isaiah 61. Verse one, the spirit of the
[56:04] Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[56:07] hath anointed me to preach good tidings
[56:09] to the meek.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He hath sent me to bind up the
[56:12] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
[56:15] the captives and the opening of the
[56:17] prison to them that are bound. Jesus
[56:19] walks up and reads that scripture, that
[56:21] portion of the scripture there in the uh
[56:24] in the synagogue at at Nazareth. He
[56:26] reads the scripture and he sits down and
[56:28] he begin to say unto them, "This day is
[56:31] this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[56:33] Listen, there's got to come that time
[56:34] for each and every one of us when we
[56:36] walk forward and we say, "The Lord said
[56:39] he would save me and this day this
[56:41] scripture is fulfilled." The Lord said,
[56:43] "I am the God that heals all your
[56:45] diseases and this day this scripture is
[56:48] fulfilled."
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe that's who he is this
[56:53] morning? That's who he is. Hallelujah.
[56:58] Amen.
[57:00] He He is the prophecy, the history, the
[57:05] Psalms.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And if you read the scripture and don't
[57:09] see him, Brother Brandham taught us,
[57:11] read it again.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:16] When you see him, everything changes.
[57:19] when he was crucified. There were over
[57:21] 28 prophecies fulfilled in a few hours
[57:25] on the cross.
[57:27] He's the rejected lamb of Isaiah 53.
[57:31] The Bible says he was wounded for our
[57:34] transgressions. I believe you can put
[57:36] your name in here.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for my transgressions.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for my iniquities.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; The chastisement of my peace was upon
[57:47] him. With his stripes, I am
[57:51] &gt;&gt; healed.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the fulfillment.
[57:55] Aren't you glad he was?
[57:56] &gt;&gt; He's the fulfillment of all the law and
[57:59] the prophets. In Hebrews 10:7, he quotes
[58:02] David saying, "Then said, I lo I come in
[58:05] the volume of the book or in the
[58:07] entirety of the testament, it is written
[58:09] of me to do thy will, oh God." He is the
[58:13] great high priest that can be touched by
[58:16] the feeling of our infirmity. If you
[58:18] have a need today, he is your high
[58:20] priest.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is your advocate. If you
[58:24] made a mistake, he is the one that you
[58:26] that you say, "Lord, I'm sorry." And he
[58:28] forgives you and his blood covers the
[58:30] sin. Oh, God. Do you believe he is that
[58:33] this morning? He not just was that. He
[58:35] is that. He is the great high priest.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is the son of man, the
[58:43] son of God, the son of David. The seven
[58:45] compound names of God, which we don't
[58:47] have time to go into all of it this
[58:49] morning, but he is Jehovah and Jehovah
[58:52] Gyra, all of those compound names. He is
[58:55] God our provider. He is God our banner.
[58:58] Hallelujah.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; He is God our healer.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Rafa.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Colossians chapter 2 and
[59:05] verse 9. For in him, you say, "Well,
[59:08] you're talking an awful lot about him."
[59:10] I don't think there's anything we could
[59:12] talk about and you know more that would
[59:15] give us more ability to understand the
[59:17] Bible than to talk about him because he
[59:19] is the word made flesh. I I don't
[59:21] believe there's anything wrong with
[59:22] talking about Jesus this morning.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; That's what this message come to do was
[59:26] to reveal Christ to us. It wasn't just
[59:29] to make us educated. It wasn't to make
[59:30] us where we know more than we used to
[59:32] know, but to reveal who he is.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; He's the great high priest, the son of
[59:37] man, the son of God. all of these things
[59:40] and in him dwelleth all. Someone say
[59:43] all.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the godhead bodily.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; No wonder the father
[59:52] there on Mount Transfiguration, the that
[59:55] great spirit of God Elohim who existed
[59:58] before the foundation of the world spoke
[1:00:00] out and said, "Hear ye him."
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. No wonder he said, "Hear ye him."
[1:00:08] the word.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hear ye him, the son of man.
[1:00:13] Hear ye him, the one who came and
[1:00:15] fulfilled every word and never made a
[1:00:17] mistake. Never. Oh, God. Who was never
[1:00:21] never a person who who sinned, who never
[1:00:24] did anything wrong. You say, "Well, why
[1:00:25] do we look at him like that? We needed a
[1:00:28] one like that. We needed somebody
[1:00:30] because I make mistakes and you make
[1:00:31] mistakes." And every man that's ever
[1:00:33] been born of a of of a sexual desire
[1:00:36] between a man and a woman has made
[1:00:37] mistakes. Come on, church. Everyone has.
[1:00:40] But he made he did no sin. Yet he was
[1:00:42] crucified for your sin and mine.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Paid the debt he did not owe.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Because I owed a debt.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; I owed a debt that I couldn't pay.
[1:01:01] Come on now,
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; brother Walt. I couldn't pay it, but he
[1:01:03] paid it.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for my healing. That's for
[1:01:06] our salvation. That's for everything
[1:01:08] that we've ever desired. Aren't you glad
[1:01:09] for the bill? He paid a debt.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; As these bodies get older and as we get
[1:01:15] more frail and feeble, some of our
[1:01:17] elders, I appreciate him being in the
[1:01:19] house of God this morning. But as you
[1:01:21] get older and you begin to kind of have
[1:01:23] to force yourself to do things, your
[1:01:25] body don't want to cooperate. Remember,
[1:01:26] he is your healer. He is the provider of
[1:01:29] a new body. He is the place that you're
[1:01:32] going to.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; He is the word of God. If the word says
[1:01:37] they shall not all sleep, but they shall
[1:01:38] all be changed. He is the word. And if
[1:01:41] you have him, you'll be a participant in
[1:01:43] that rapture.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:47] Hear ye him, the word
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; made flesh.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; What was written and spoken by the
[1:01:54] prophets made flesh. He is the word.
[1:01:58] John 1 and1 says, "In the beginning was
[1:02:00] the word and the word was with God and
[1:02:03] the word was God."
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; All things were made by him and without
[1:02:14] him was not anything made that was made.
[1:02:16] So brother Brandham explains this. All
[1:02:17] that was in God he poured into Christ.
[1:02:20] The logos the word.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ he pours into the
[1:02:25] church. Yeah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "All things were made by him."
[1:02:29] Yes,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Without him was not anything made that
[1:02:32] was made. In him was life, and the life
[1:02:35] was the light of men. And the light
[1:02:38] shineth in darkness, and the darkness
[1:02:41] comprehended it not.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; If you jump down to verse 14, he talks
[1:02:46] about John coming the the lesser light
[1:02:48] to introduce the greater. In John
[1:02:51] chapter 1 verse14 it says and the word
[1:02:54] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:02:58] beheld his glory. The glory as of the
[1:03:00] only begotten of the father full of
[1:03:02] grace and truth. The reason we believe
[1:03:05] what we believe is not because somebody
[1:03:07] wrote it but because Jesus became what
[1:03:10] was written.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's a real important distinction.
[1:03:15] Buddha wrote things and said things.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Right? Muhammad wrote things and said
[1:03:20] things.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. But Jesus never left us
[1:03:26] a book.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; He was the book.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't Oh, come on. What the prophets
[1:03:32] wrote over hundreds of years, sir.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus came and said, "I am he."
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He was the book. So, he didn't have to
[1:03:41] try to be what he was. He just became
[1:03:43] what he was. And I think that's where
[1:03:45] many times and I'm just preaching to you
[1:03:47] this morning trying to get a thought
[1:03:49] across to you, but many times we get
[1:03:51] where we struggle and where we get
[1:03:53] messed up is when we try to make
[1:03:55] something happen. We we got to try to
[1:03:57] defend something. We got to try to
[1:03:58] become something. We got to try to fix
[1:04:01] ourselves. And you never be able to fix
[1:04:03] yourself. You need to come to him and
[1:04:05] say, "Lord, I I'm going to give it all
[1:04:07] to you. I I believe you're my healer. I
[1:04:09] believe you're my savior. I believe you
[1:04:11] can take care of my marriage. I believe
[1:04:13] you can take care of my children. Come
[1:04:14] on, church. Has he done it for you? He's
[1:04:16] He's been a good God. He come and took
[1:04:19] care of the things that we needed.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; And I'm so grateful for that.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; He's not a God who doesn't care, but
[1:04:26] he's a God who sees every
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; sparrow that falls.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; He saw you.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe he's here this morning.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; He He saw you go to work.
[1:04:43] So, you get up early Monday morning.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You maybe struggle with your car, do
[1:04:47] whatever it is that you did, and go to
[1:04:49] work and sit down. You felt so alone
[1:04:52] because maybe your co-workers don't
[1:04:54] believe like what you believe. And maybe
[1:04:56] they don't they say things and do things
[1:04:58] that aren't maybe exactly what you would
[1:05:01] do or say. And you feel like a fish out
[1:05:03] of water.
[1:05:05] Maybe your body was sick and maybe you
[1:05:08] struggle with your family and no feel
[1:05:09] like nobody understands you.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; He saw it.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; See, this is where the word becomes
[1:05:17] flesh. It becomes real.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; He saw it.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; You struggled. You you questioned. You
[1:05:23] had a thought about it. Said, "Well, is
[1:05:24] the message right? Am I even a
[1:05:26] Christian? Did I even get anything? Do I
[1:05:29] really have the Holy Ghost?" He saw
[1:05:31] that. Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And he called this morning a preacher to
[1:05:35] come and preach the word to tell you,
[1:05:36] you are what the Bible says that you
[1:05:38] are. You are what the word says that you
[1:05:40] are. You are not what the world says you
[1:05:43] are. You're not what your job says you
[1:05:44] are. You might have lost your job, but
[1:05:46] you can't lose him. You might have You
[1:05:48] might have lost money, but you can't
[1:05:49] lose him. You might have done some
[1:05:51] stupid stuff, but you can't lose him.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Brother Ryan, you
[1:05:56] can't lose him. You can't You can't
[1:05:58] He'll never give up on you. what you got
[1:06:00] you'll always have. Don't you worry
[1:06:02] about not about losing him. He'll always
[1:06:04] You'll always have him. People may not
[1:06:06] treat you right, but he always will.
[1:06:08] People may not understand, but he always
[1:06:11] will.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh, and we
[1:06:18] beheld his glory, the glory as of the
[1:06:21] only begotten of the father, full of
[1:06:23] grace
[1:06:24] and truth. Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; In our text, Jesus took Peter, James,
[1:06:29] and John to the mountain.
[1:06:31] They saw him speaking with Moses and
[1:06:33] Elijah, the two greatest Old Testament
[1:06:35] prophets. Elijah represented justice.
[1:06:38] Moses represented the law. And Peter
[1:06:41] looks at that and said, "This is pretty
[1:06:42] good. I'm going to build a denomination.
[1:06:46] Fact, let's make two."
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Where there's one, there's always a
[1:06:50] split, you know.
[1:06:52] So where wherever there's a first
[1:06:55] church, there's always a second church.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; I saw the other day this first second
[1:07:01] church of a certain denomination in
[1:07:03] Houston, the second church had 20,000
[1:07:06] members. I thought, my goodness, what
[1:07:07] does the first church have?
[1:07:11] That's why they always wanted, this was
[1:07:12] the beginning of man's idea. Said, well,
[1:07:14] let's just make a a tabernacle for each
[1:07:16] of them.
[1:07:17] But God wouldn't allow that at that
[1:07:19] time. Look what happened. While he
[1:07:22] spake, a bright cloud overshadowed them,
[1:07:24] and a voice out of the cloud which said,
[1:07:26] "This is my beloved son."
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; In whom I'm well pleased.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Hear you him.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; See, if you're in Christ, God is pleased
[1:07:38] with you.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we understand that today
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; because he's pleased with him.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Right? The pastor may not be pleased
[1:07:46] with you. Somebody else may not be
[1:07:47] pleased with you. the church, the
[1:07:49] deacons, somebody, your wife, your
[1:07:51] husband. Come on, church.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; They may not be pleased with you this
[1:07:54] morning, but but God was pleased in the
[1:07:57] sun.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; And if you are in him before the from
[1:08:00] before the foundation of the world, he
[1:08:02] is pleased with you.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 9:7 says the same thing.
[1:08:07] There was a cloud that overshadowed them
[1:08:08] and a voice came out of the cloud
[1:08:10] saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear
[1:08:13] him.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Hear him." Notice what he says. He
[1:08:17] doesn't say see him
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; or even touch him.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hear him.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's the word.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hear the word.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; I know I'm
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; going over and over this this morning,
[1:08:32] but hear ye him.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; The word, the same word. Hebrews 13:8.
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:08:42] and forever. Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And this is our contention. And the
[1:08:46] message of the hour is that Jesus is
[1:08:48] still the same God today. He He's not
[1:08:51] different than what he was, but he's the
[1:08:52] same God. He can do the same things as
[1:08:54] he did when he walked the shores of
[1:08:56] Galilee. He's the same and he's been
[1:08:58] proven to be the same in our day.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:09:02] today and forever. He's still the word
[1:09:05] made flesh. Yes.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; The Old Testament speaks of the coming
[1:09:10] of Christ in a physical body and what he
[1:09:12] would do and how he would act.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; But the New Testament speaks of his
[1:09:17] coming in his body,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; the church, which is his bride.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; In Colossians chapter 1, verse 21, let's
[1:09:23] read down through verse 29.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; You love the word this morning.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Verse 21. You that were sometime
[1:09:30] alienated. Yes, sir.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Enemies in your mind.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; I love that. enemies in your mind
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; by wicked works.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Yet now hath he reconciled
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death
[1:09:47] to present you holy and unblameable and
[1:09:51] unreprovable
[1:09:52] in his sight. Right?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; If you continue in the faith, listen,
[1:09:56] and grounded and settled, and be not
[1:09:58] moved away from the hope of the gospel
[1:10:00] which you've heard, and which was
[1:10:02] preached to every creature which is
[1:10:04] under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made a
[1:10:07] minister. He said, who now rejoice in my
[1:10:10] sufferings for you, and fill up that
[1:10:12] which is behind of the afflictions of
[1:10:13] Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake,
[1:10:16] which is the church. So, he said, I
[1:10:18] suffer for the sake of the church, not
[1:10:20] for my own sin. because we cannot suffer
[1:10:22] for sin. But we we submit ourselves to
[1:10:24] the will of God for our lives for the
[1:10:27] church,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; for his body.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Whereof I am made a minister
[1:10:31] according to the dispensation of God
[1:10:34] which is given to me for you or that
[1:10:36] portion of understanding of the mystery
[1:10:38] of God and the will of God given to me
[1:10:40] for you." He said, "Which is given to me
[1:10:42] for you to fulfill the word of God, even
[1:10:45] the mystery which has been hid from ages
[1:10:47] and from generations." But now, someone
[1:10:51] say, "Now
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; is made manifest to his saints." So Paul
[1:10:55] is going to tell them something that's
[1:10:56] been in the mind of God. It's been
[1:10:58] hidden. It was hidden even from Isaiah
[1:10:59] and from Jeremiah. But now he's going to
[1:11:02] tell them something that was hid
[1:11:03] previously. He said, "The mystery which
[1:11:05] has been hid, but now it's made manifest
[1:11:07] to his saints to whom God would make
[1:11:08] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:11:11] this mystery among the Gentiles, which
[1:11:13] is Christ in you."
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; I like that. Christ in you, the hope
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; of glory.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Whom we preach, warning every man, and
[1:11:27] teaching every man in all wisdom, that
[1:11:29] we may present every man perfect or
[1:11:30] mature in Christ Jesus, whereinto I also
[1:11:33] labor, striving according to his
[1:11:35] working, which workketh in me mightily.
[1:11:38] Can I say something this morning? To be
[1:11:40] a Christian, you've got to believe Paul.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of people want to do
[1:11:45] away with Paul's teachings today.
[1:11:47] There's a movement that said, "Well, we
[1:11:49] just take what Jesus says and not Paul."
[1:11:50] But to be a Christian, you've got to
[1:11:52] believe Paul,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; right? His words were scripture. In
[1:11:55] fact, Peter says Paul, what Paul wrote
[1:11:57] was scripture.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; So, you've got to believe the Apostle
[1:12:00] Paul to be a Christian because without
[1:12:03] the Apostle Paul, you don't even
[1:12:04] understand what a Christian is or what
[1:12:06] the church is. Like, you would have no
[1:12:09] understanding of that without him. So,
[1:12:11] the mystery of Christ in you was not
[1:12:12] revealed to John the Baptist. It was not
[1:12:14] revealed to Apollos. wasn't even
[1:12:16] revealed to the 11 original disciples,
[1:12:18] but it was revealed to Paul. All right.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3:8, he said, "Unto me whom
[1:12:22] less than the least of all saints is
[1:12:25] this grace given that I should preach
[1:12:27] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[1:12:29] riches of Christ and to make all men see
[1:12:32] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[1:12:34] which from the beginning of the world
[1:12:36] have been hid in God who created all
[1:12:38] things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[1:12:41] that now unto the principalities and
[1:12:42] powers, excuse me, in heavenly places
[1:12:45] might be known by the church the
[1:12:47] manifold wisdom of God. The the the the
[1:12:50] the many part wisdom of God. Are you
[1:12:54] with me now? Manifold wisdom according
[1:12:56] to the eternal purpose which he purposed
[1:12:59] in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have
[1:13:02] boldness and access with confidence by
[1:13:04] the faith of him. So Paul is telling us
[1:13:07] there's a mystery of the church and the
[1:13:09] church is going to become the very image
[1:13:11] of God. It's going to become godlike.
[1:13:13] That's what godliness is. It's going to
[1:13:16] become the word made flesh again. And so
[1:13:18] we know that as time went on, if you
[1:13:21] look at the history of the church, we
[1:13:23] have a benefit of being able to look at
[1:13:24] church history, we can see that that
[1:13:26] image was corrupted by the mystery of
[1:13:29] iniquity. Go to 2 Thessalonians chapter
[1:13:32] 2 and verse 7. It says, "For the mystery
[1:13:35] of iniquity
[1:13:37] doth already work." So this is right
[1:13:40] during that first church age, right
[1:13:43] after Pentecost. Paul is saying the
[1:13:45] mystery of iniquity was already working.
[1:13:49] So God had a plan, but Satan also had a
[1:13:51] plan. And Satan's plan is to thwart
[1:13:54] God's plan. So the way Satan does that
[1:13:57] is the same way he did it at the
[1:13:58] beginning with Adam and Eve. I hope
[1:14:00] you're following me this morning. So
[1:14:02] God's going to make sons.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about in
[1:14:06] adoption, right? That's what we're
[1:14:08] talking about becoming full-born sons
[1:14:10] and daughters of God.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Right? God has got a plan to have sons
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; and daughters that believe his word,
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; that speak his word,
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; that are manifested on the earth and
[1:14:21] able, brother uh brother brother Jaden,
[1:14:23] they're able to actually
[1:14:26] control their nature.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? They they they can
[1:14:31] speak like he spoke to the storm. They
[1:14:34] can speak and control the atmospheres in
[1:14:36] their home,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; the atmosphere at work. Are you with me
[1:14:39] now?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; So, that was God's plan. And Satan's
[1:14:42] plan was to thwart that. So what he does
[1:14:44] is he doesn't come against it. Oh, he he
[1:14:47] does that as well. But his main thrust
[1:14:49] is not to kill them and throw them in
[1:14:52] prison. He tries that and it doesn't
[1:14:53] work. But his main thrust is to actually
[1:14:56] deceive them into thinking that they can
[1:14:59] have more knowledge than what his word
[1:15:01] says. See, because you can't take away
[1:15:04] from the word of God. You also can't add
[1:15:06] to the word of God. And that second one
[1:15:09] is very important because that's what
[1:15:10] Satan did. You remember he he he took
[1:15:12] away part but then he added to and what
[1:15:15] he did is he when he added to surely you
[1:15:18] won't die.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; God didn't say that.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; So he adds to the the word. I I want to
[1:15:28] I want us to understand this morning
[1:15:30] that we don't have a right to do that.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I can't just preach anything I want to.
[1:15:35] Right.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; It's got to be in the word.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Just we just don't get to make it up.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And neither do Christians get to make it
[1:15:44] up.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; So, well, I don't like what that person
[1:15:46] does. But is it part of the word?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Right. You may not like it. That may be
[1:15:51] your tradition, your way of doing
[1:15:52] things. But if it's not the word, don't
[1:15:54] add your interpretation to the word.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Or what you've been taught in the past
[1:16:00] to the word.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Or your experience to the word. Let's
[1:16:03] just believe the word. Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; So the image Thank you. Heard a young
[1:16:09] man saying amen there.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Either that he was mad at his dad.
[1:16:15] That image was corrupted by the mystery
[1:16:18] of iniquity.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The mystery of iniquity. And he said
[1:16:22] that already works. Even that first
[1:16:24] church ages, he said only he who now
[1:16:26] leth or preventeth he who prevents it
[1:16:28] will prevent it until he be taken out of
[1:16:30] the way. Speaking of the Holy Spirit. 1
[1:16:32] John 21:18 said, "Little children, it is
[1:16:35] the last time."
[1:16:38] If first, if John is writing to that
[1:16:40] early church and saying it's the last
[1:16:42] time, we're in the end time of the end
[1:16:44] time today.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; But he said it's the last time as you
[1:16:49] have heard that Antichrist should come,
[1:16:50] shall come, even now are there many
[1:16:54] antichrists
[1:16:56] whereby we know that it is the last
[1:16:58] time. Right? So there were many uh
[1:17:01] antichrists, many many workers of
[1:17:03] iniquity, many people who would not stay
[1:17:05] with the word. They could not become the
[1:17:07] word because they were not the word from
[1:17:09] the beginning.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; But they but they created a Satan moved
[1:17:14] to create among men another religion
[1:17:17] that looked okay. It looked like the
[1:17:19] original, but it wasn't the original.
[1:17:21] And actually what he did is he ate away
[1:17:24] at what brother Brandham calls the bride
[1:17:26] tree. If you go listen to restoration of
[1:17:28] the bride tree, it's a great sermon. But
[1:17:30] the Brandon preaches that and he says
[1:17:32] that the tree was eaten away by four
[1:17:34] messengers of death, deformed by
[1:17:37] paganism and until it no longer looked
[1:17:39] like the original. Right. Until now,
[1:17:42] there's not much deceptive about
[1:17:44] Catholicism if you read the word.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Because they're nothing like the
[1:17:49] Bible at all. They've just added
[1:17:50] wherever they wanted to add, taken away
[1:17:52] wherever they want to take away. Right?
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; And there's not much in deceptive about
[1:17:55] it at all. Yet there is still deceptive
[1:17:57] religion. But he he he deformed it by
[1:18:01] paganism until it no longer looked like
[1:18:04] the original. And the church no longer
[1:18:06] fulfilled the commission of Mark 16.
[1:18:09] Mark 16:15. He said unto them, "Go you
[1:18:12] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:18:14] to every creature."
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And they substituted that for a forced
[1:18:18] religion.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Right. to get into politics and and and
[1:18:22] the inquisitions and and kill people
[1:18:25] that didn't agree with them.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Preach the gospel."
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; He never said, "Force somebody to
[1:18:31] believe something." He said, "Preach the
[1:18:32] gospel.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Those who want to believe will believe
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; to every creature. He that believeth and
[1:18:37] is baptized shall be saved. He that
[1:18:39] believeth not shall be damned. And these
[1:18:40] signs shall follow them that believe."
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; In my name shall they cast out devils.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues. They
[1:18:47] shall take up serpents. And if they
[1:18:49] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[1:18:50] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:18:53] sick and they shall recover. And and yet
[1:18:56] over time, the church didn't do that at
[1:18:58] all.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; The entire purpose of the church is in
[1:19:00] Mark 16. That's what God has
[1:19:03] commissioned us to do. Over time, they
[1:19:05] got to where they didn't do it at all.
[1:19:06] And so, the original purpose was lost.
[1:19:08] The word could not become flesh in the
[1:19:10] people because the word wasn't being
[1:19:12] taught.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Right. How can the word become flesh if
[1:19:15] the word isn't being heard? Faith comes
[1:19:18] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:19:19] God.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; So without a pure word, there cannot be
[1:19:22] a pure faith to manifest that word. But
[1:19:25] remember, he was the word from the
[1:19:27] beginning.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus was the word from the
[1:19:30] beginning and we become the word.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Now there is a difference.
[1:19:35] See, we weren't virgin born.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; We were not all of God, the fullness
[1:19:42] wrapped up in the Godhead bodily,
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; That's why our words are not infallible.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; We do make mistakes,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; We come into the world speaking lies,
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; right? We had to have a nature change.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; So, he was the word from the beginning.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; We become the word.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? You young
[1:20:03] people, you're you're not going to be
[1:20:05] perfect.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And you need to understand that.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You need to you need to be you need to
[1:20:10] understand that. And we want you to live
[1:20:12] right. We want you to do right. We want
[1:20:14] you to do better than we did.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And yet we realize that our children are
[1:20:18] just little unconverted versions of
[1:20:19] ourselves.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Before they get saved,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; right? But we want them to do better
[1:20:24] than we did. We don't want them to make
[1:20:25] the same mistakes. But if you make a
[1:20:27] mistake, if you mess up in some way, you
[1:20:30] say, "Well, I'm not perfect." Well,
[1:20:31] nobody is.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You weren't the word from the beginning.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; You become the word.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; You were in his mind, but you bypassed
[1:20:42] that word body. Yeah,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; right. It's what he taught us. And who
[1:20:44] is this MelkiseDC? You bypass your
[1:20:46] theophony and you come to the world to
[1:20:48] be tested,
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; right? And you, oh, you failed the test
[1:20:51] many times. I failed the test many
[1:20:53] times. He never failed,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; but we failed the test many times. But
[1:20:57] aren't you glad there's one who stands
[1:20:59] in our place? Aren't you glad? What was
[1:21:02] it? He wanted to see if you would
[1:21:03] believe him. He wanted to see if you had
[1:21:05] the faith to say, "Lord, I know I'm a
[1:21:07] child of God. I'm a son of daughter of
[1:21:09] God." So you young people don't get
[1:21:11] discouraged if you make a mistake. You
[1:21:12] get right back up. Get back in the house
[1:21:14] of God and ask God to forgive you and
[1:21:16] move right on with your life.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Don't sit and dwell on that mistake.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Satan will use that condemnation to
[1:21:27] destroy your mind.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Get up and go. Tomorrow's a new day.
[1:21:34] If God could forgive Paul of all he did
[1:21:36] and use him as a messenger of grace,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; surely he could forgive me, make me new,
[1:21:43] and make me go on into the presence of
[1:21:45] God where I don't do those things no
[1:21:47] more.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; But how can we become the word if we
[1:21:53] don't hear it?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; We're becoming the word. And that's what
[1:21:57] brother Brandham was trying to get to
[1:21:59] the people. He said the Pentecostals had
[1:22:00] the Holy Ghost. They thought, "Well,
[1:22:02] that's it." Yes.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; But no, there's a word coming
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; and that has come and we have to become
[1:22:08] that word.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; How are we going to become that word if
[1:22:12] we're not hearing it?
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And this is our contention for the
[1:22:15] message of the hour. If the only message
[1:22:17] that you hear, if the only uh part of
[1:22:20] God's prophet's words that you hear is
[1:22:21] what I'm preaching to you, you're not
[1:22:23] going to know if what I'm preaching to
[1:22:25] you is right or not.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You've got to hear it.
[1:22:32] You got to hear it.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to There's no no uh
[1:22:36] structure to that order to it. I don't
[1:22:38] tell you listen to a certain tape at a
[1:22:39] certain time. What do we tell you? You
[1:22:41] got to hear it.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is in you, it wants to
[1:22:44] feed on the word. Don't you want to feed
[1:22:46] on the word of God this morning? Don't
[1:22:48] you want it to be a part of who you are?
[1:22:50] Don't you want Don't you want to become
[1:22:52] that word? Say, "Lord, I need more
[1:22:54] victory in my life." Feed on the word of
[1:22:56] God.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible and pray. Yeah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You want to be a better Christian? Read
[1:23:01] your Bible and communicate with the
[1:23:03] author. Read your Bible. Listen to the
[1:23:05] message of the hour. Become the word.
[1:23:07] How can you become the word when you
[1:23:09] don't hear it?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; So just because you say, "Well, I'm
[1:23:14] saved. I've been filled with the Holy
[1:23:15] Ghost." But you need to become
[1:23:17] everything that God meant for you to be.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And in doing that, we receive in this
[1:23:22] age our adoption, the change of our
[1:23:24] bodies.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Listen, he was
[1:23:27] God's masterpiece.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; So God had prophets. He had prophets
[1:23:32] over time and but here come here come
[1:23:35] the God prophet.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; He was God's perfect image. And and
[1:23:40] brother Brandham tells the story and you
[1:23:41] all know it how that when Michelangelo
[1:23:44] was making the statue of Moses that he
[1:23:46] stood there and here he made such a
[1:23:48] lifelike what what he had in his mind
[1:23:52] became so lifelike before him. It was so
[1:23:55] perfect to what was in his mind. He He
[1:23:57] was inspired and he took his hammer and
[1:24:01] he struck it on the knee and he said,
[1:24:02] "Speak."
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; But it couldn't speak cuz it was made
[1:24:08] out of marbles.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; He smoked it. It said, "Speak." But it
[1:24:14] could not speak.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; What are we preaching on this morning?
[1:24:18] Hear ye him.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; But God took his son.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Can we say it that way? his masterpiece.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; He hung on a cross.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; He smoked him.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; And when he did, he cried, "Speak."
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And the masterpiece said, "It's
[1:24:34] finished."
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; But he didn't just have a masterpiece
[1:24:41] groom, if we could say it that way. A
[1:24:42] masterpiece in his mind of Son of Man.
[1:24:44] See, if Jesus was all that God wanted,
[1:24:47] he would have never had to have died.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; But God wanted you to be part of his
[1:24:51] program.
[1:24:53] He wanted me to be part of his program.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'd be the firstborn of how
[1:24:57] many? Many sons.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; The firstborn among many brethren. And
[1:25:01] so he wanted us to be a part. Oh, come
[1:25:04] on, church. To be a part of what he what
[1:25:06] he is in his plan. He didn't just want
[1:25:08] us to be. He predestinated us to be. He
[1:25:11] fordained us to be.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so in doing that, he has
[1:25:16] also made a masterpiece down through
[1:25:18] seven church ages. And finally, he got
[1:25:20] the bride where he wanted to get her.
[1:25:22] And what is the bride to do? The bride
[1:25:24] when he when he when he smites the
[1:25:27] bride, when she is rejected from
[1:25:28] denomination, when she's rejected from
[1:25:31] her people, when the world don't
[1:25:32] understand her, come on, church. When
[1:25:34] she's persecuted and afflicted,
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; she is smitten. The smitten bride.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; And she speaks. Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:25:45] church, this is where we're coming to
[1:25:47] the maturity to speak. Remember I told
[1:25:49] you that a child when it says a child is
[1:25:52] is though he's an heir, he's no
[1:25:55] different from a slave, that word child
[1:25:56] means someone who does not speak.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:02] Oh, God.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; In order. But what did God say when he
[1:26:05] when he when he come and he anointed his
[1:26:08] son? He come down and and he said, "This
[1:26:10] is my beloved son." What what was he
[1:26:13] saying? It was an adoption ceremony. He
[1:26:16] said, "Hear him."
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; He speaks.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; That's where the bride has to come to.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; We hear a voice coming down from the
[1:26:27] cloud saying, "This is my beloved son.
[1:26:29] Hear you him." Brother Brandon said, "If
[1:26:31] they're going to hear, he's got to
[1:26:33] speak."
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. just a few days before he
[1:26:38] was smitten. This is my son whom I'm
[1:26:40] pleased to dwell in. I have molded him.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; I've been 4,000 years bringing him to
[1:26:45] this. And now he is so perfect. I've got
[1:26:48] to smite him so he can speak.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. He is the perfected one.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't drive that home enough,
[1:26:58] church.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. Quit listening to the voice
[1:27:02] of Facebook.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Quit listening to the voice of Tik Tok.
[1:27:07] Quit listening to I'm not telling you
[1:27:08] you can't have those things. I'm saying
[1:27:09] quit listening to it. Quit letting it
[1:27:11] define who you are.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Quit listening to your to your neighbor.
[1:27:15] Quit listening to others that are
[1:27:16] around. Quit listening to your family
[1:27:18] member say you don't look like you used
[1:27:19] to and and you ought to go do this or do
[1:27:21] that. Quit listening to them old friends
[1:27:23] back in that old lifestyle. Hear ye him.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him who can change your life.
[1:27:28] Hear ye him who can make you new. Hear
[1:27:30] ye him who's your healer. Hear ye him
[1:27:32] who is the word made flesh. Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He wants to speak to you today.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; He doesn't just want to speak to you. He
[1:27:42] wants to speak through you.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; They did not understand that the
[1:27:47] scripture must be fulfilled.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And so they didn't understand why he was
[1:27:51] smitten.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And we we find even the two men on the
[1:27:54] road to Emmas, remember they were sad.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Why were they sad? Well, they gave
[1:28:01] because they didn't understand.
[1:28:04] And this is where people fall into this
[1:28:05] spirit of depression in our day.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Right? You need to hear him.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; They were sad.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz they had no they weren't listening
[1:28:16] to him.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; They were even hearing him and not
[1:28:18] listening to him.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; So they were walking with him along the
[1:28:22] way.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And as they walked with him from from
[1:28:25] Jerusalem to Emmas, here he comes. He
[1:28:27] begins to talk to him. He said, "Why are
[1:28:28] you so sad?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Why do you have so much anxiety? Why are
[1:28:32] you so worried? Come on.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; They said
[1:28:36] they said, "Have you not heard what's
[1:28:38] happened?"
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And when they told him,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; he said, "All fools,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; slow of heart
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; to believe all that the prophets spoke."
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay this morning.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Is all that the prophet spoke? What did
[1:28:53] the prophet speak? They spoke of him.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. So he said,
[1:28:57] "Oh fools and soul of heart to believe
[1:28:59] all that the prophets had spoken." He
[1:29:00] began to go through the scripture. I'd
[1:29:02] have liked to been part of that sermon.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; That that six-hour sermon I believe was
[1:29:06] going back to Emmas and as he talked
[1:29:09] with them along the way, they begin to
[1:29:12] something in their hearts begin to grab
[1:29:14] a hold of what he was saying, but they
[1:29:15] didn't realize who he was.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; See, you can't really listen to him like
[1:29:19] you should until you know who he is.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; But when he Oh, church, it's a perfect
[1:29:25] time for this day. When he come back to
[1:29:27] their house, he he did something that he
[1:29:30] had done before. Right. Right.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; He did something in his resurrected body
[1:29:34] that he had done in his natural body.
[1:29:36] What happened in our age? A prophet
[1:29:38] stood and did something that Jesus did
[1:29:40] when he was here. It didn't make the man
[1:29:42] Jesus. What did it do? Hallelujah. What
[1:29:44] did it do? It proved to us that he was
[1:29:47] speaking and we better listen to what he
[1:29:49] said. And so when he did something he
[1:29:50] had done before, what did they do? They
[1:29:52] said, "Did not our hearts burn within us
[1:29:55] as he talked to us along the way? Wasn't
[1:29:57] the word good?" See if you realize he is
[1:30:00] here then you realize the importance of
[1:30:02] the word. Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 or 1:1 rather. God who at
[1:30:09] sunundry times and in diverse manners
[1:30:12] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[1:30:15] the prophets
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:30:20] by his son.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:30:25] things
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; by whom also he made the worlds.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; All right church. just a little deep,
[1:30:32] but I hope we can understand it this
[1:30:34] morning. Kind of grab a hold of the
[1:30:35] concept. It's why he had to return a son
[1:30:37] of man.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; he had to speak.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; I hope we get that and don't confuse
[1:30:44] that with the man
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham was not the son
[1:30:47] of man. He was a son of man revealing
[1:30:50] the son of man. But the son of man had
[1:30:52] to speak.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look,
[1:31:03] he said he's he's spoken unto us by the
[1:31:05] son of being the brightness of his
[1:31:06] glory, the express image of his person,
[1:31:08] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:31:10] his power. When he had by himself purged
[1:31:13] our sins, sat down on the right hand of
[1:31:16] the majesty on high, being made so much
[1:31:18] better than the angels, as he hath by
[1:31:20] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:31:21] name than they. Look, church, when he
[1:31:24] was born, a baby in a manger,
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. is Emanuel,
[1:31:31] God with us.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Right? He was the word made flesh that
[1:31:36] said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the interpretation of
[1:31:42] the written word.
[1:31:44] Listen, he didn't come as a general with
[1:31:46] armies.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; He didn't come as a king with subjects.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; He come as a baby
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; in a manger.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; And the people didn't recognize it, but
[1:31:57] the shepherds did. Yes.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And they said they said, "This is him."
[1:32:01] And they worshiped him. And the and the
[1:32:03] magi worshiped him and the different
[1:32:05] ones, but the majority could not see
[1:32:07] that God had become flesh. The word had
[1:32:09] been made flesh. But but but I'm so glad
[1:32:11] that I saw it. I'm so glad he revealed
[1:32:14] himself to me. Aren't you glad he
[1:32:15] revealed himself to you?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; You were like those shepherds that were
[1:32:19] out there and you didn't know anything,
[1:32:21] but God spoke to you at a supernatural
[1:32:23] experience to reveal himself to you. And
[1:32:25] he he said, "Here is the word made
[1:32:28] flesh.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him."
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:32:36] He has spoken.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; But the church through the corruption of
[1:32:42] creed and dogma no longer hear his
[1:32:44] voice.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; He spoke in this gentile age through
[1:32:48] Paul and through the other writers of
[1:32:50] the New Testament. But there had to come
[1:32:53] a people who would become the
[1:32:55] manifestation of the book,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; the New Testament.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Right? As the old the the seals of the
[1:33:02] Old Testament were were broken in
[1:33:04] Christ.
[1:33:06] The seals of the New Testament, we could
[1:33:08] put it that way, were broken in in were
[1:33:10] broken in the at the time for the
[1:33:13] emerging of the bride,
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; right? The bride, an infant bride coming
[1:33:17] on the earth. So, the word had been
[1:33:19] veiled by denomination and creeds for
[1:33:22] 2,000 years, but it had to be preached
[1:33:24] in purity. Again, I know this is you
[1:33:26] say, "Well, this is so complicated,
[1:33:27] Brother Ben," but it's not really. It's
[1:33:29] it's simplicity.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; You had to become what God saw in his
[1:33:34] mind before we leave the earth.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; And God did it the way he's always done
[1:33:39] it. He come and spoke through a prophet,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; revealed himself to a generation, said,
[1:33:44] "I'm the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:45] forever." And made us ready. Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; It's really simple,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; But the word had been veiled for 2,000
[1:33:53] years. And those men that died and
[1:33:56] preached, they preached a portion of the
[1:33:58] word, but they died in that and died in
[1:34:00] faith. But they without us cannot be
[1:34:02] made perfect, the scripture says. So the
[1:34:05] church had to be restored back the years
[1:34:08] that those four messengers of death,
[1:34:10] Joel 2:25, I will restore to you the
[1:34:12] years, the locust, defeating the
[1:34:14] cankworm, the caterpillar, the palmer
[1:34:15] worm, my great army which I sent among
[1:34:17] you. How would he restore? Well, I'd ask
[1:34:20] you to go back and read in Ezekiel about
[1:34:22] the valley of dry bones.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; How many have ever read that?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; The valley of dry bones. If you go read
[1:34:28] that, what does he say? You know, God
[1:34:30] doesn't say, "Ezekiel, I'm going to
[1:34:32] stand you here and then you look and see
[1:34:33] what I do."
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; That's not what he did. He told Ezekiel
[1:34:37] the prophet, he said, "Prophesy to those
[1:34:39] bones."
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Ezekiel, can these bones
[1:34:43] live?"
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel said, "Lord, you know."
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Huh? Look at the humility of the
[1:34:48] prophet. He didn't say, "Well, I know it
[1:34:49] all." He said, "You know, Lord." Because
[1:34:51] the prophet only knows what's revealed
[1:34:52] to him.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Right. But he said, "Lord, you know,
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Prophesy to the bones."
[1:34:59] And the bones started to come together.
[1:35:01] And he said, "Prophesy again." And he
[1:35:03] said, "The wind, the breath of God blew
[1:35:06] into those bodies and they become a
[1:35:07] mighty army." How would he restore? By
[1:35:10] the voice of a prophet,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; That's how he would restore.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; That's why we're different. It's why we
[1:35:19] do what we do.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Because God spoke in our day.
[1:35:24] And and so we know God would use a
[1:35:26] prophet's lips to speak the word of
[1:35:27] restoration to restore our churches, to
[1:35:31] restore our families,
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; to restore us as individuals
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; in a world that used us and abused us
[1:35:39] and come on church.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; World full of drugs and sex and iniquity
[1:35:43] and church. World full of whatever they
[1:35:47] want to do, they do. A world that's gone
[1:35:49] crazy. A world that's left the word of
[1:35:51] God. But he said, "I will restore,
[1:35:54] sayeth the Lord."
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; And it wouldn't be for everybody, but it
[1:35:58] would be for those who were who were to
[1:36:00] be alive at the time of his coming and
[1:36:02] awake and ready for that time. Oh, the
[1:36:05] his predestined bride.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; The book had to be sealed till the time
[1:36:09] for the fullness to come. Are you still
[1:36:10] with me? I've got just a few more
[1:36:11] minutes and we'll close.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I promise I won't preach as long as
[1:36:15] brother Stewart did.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I better not promise that. I don't know
[1:36:20] how long he preached.
[1:36:23] Daniel 12:4 But thou, oh Daniel, shut up
[1:36:26] the words and seal the book,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; even to the time of the end.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Where are we living, church?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
[1:36:36] shall be increased.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:7, but in the days,
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; of the voice, hallelujah, of the seventh
[1:36:43] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:36:45] mystery of God should be finished, as he
[1:36:47] had declared to his servants the
[1:36:48] prophet. What are we telling you in
[1:36:50] this? We're not telling you hear a
[1:36:51] prophet. We're telling you hear the
[1:36:52] word.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Hear Christ the word.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Hey, excuse me for screaming at you. I
[1:37:02] don't mean to do that.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice, the
[1:37:08] mystery of God should be finished to get
[1:37:10] declared to his servants. The prophets
[1:37:12] were living in that time. In John 14:20,
[1:37:14] Jesus said, "At that day,"
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; that's this day, "you shall know that I
[1:37:19] am in my father,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; ye in me, and I in you."
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of adoption, if we can
[1:37:25] say it that way. This is the hour of the
[1:37:27] fullness. This is the hour of the
[1:37:28] opening of the word. This is Oh, this is
[1:37:30] the hour of of the bride masterpiece.
[1:37:33] This is the hour. Oh, this is the hour
[1:37:36] when we're going home. Hallelujah.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; So, he has formed another masterpiece, a
[1:37:41] body to dwell in. Listen, brother
[1:37:42] Brandham said, "The great sculptor is
[1:37:44] counting on you."
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brandham came and did
[1:37:49] his part,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And we we we love it, don't we?
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; But that but he's not counting on
[1:37:56] brother Brandham,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; He's counting on you.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Willing to stand and have yourself
[1:38:02] shaped into the likeness of his
[1:38:04] requirement that his word requires.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; So you can do one of two things. You can
[1:38:08] you can rebel against him. You can turn
[1:38:10] your back on it. You can walk away from
[1:38:12] it and you can say, "I'm just going to
[1:38:13] do what's good for me and my family." Or
[1:38:15] you can say, "Lord, I believe I'm part
[1:38:17] of that bride. Lord, make me what you
[1:38:19] want me to be. Sculpt me into your
[1:38:21] image, Lord. Let your word cut away
[1:38:23] every part that's unlike you. Let me be
[1:38:25] a real son or daughter of God."
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; The great sculptor is counting on you,
[1:38:30] willing to stand and have yourself
[1:38:32] shaped into the likenesses of his
[1:38:34] requirement that his word requires.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the last days, I'll pour
[1:38:38] out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons
[1:38:40] and daughters shall prophesy. He said
[1:38:42] Christ is the identified masterpiece of
[1:38:43] the world made word made flesh. You are
[1:38:45] asked to identify yourself in him by the
[1:38:48] same word to be the masterpiece for the
[1:38:50] bride.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; He said now brethren, God had a
[1:38:52] masterpiece then to present to the
[1:38:54] world. Now he wants a masterpiece today.
[1:38:57] Listen church, are you willing?
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I know you've heard a lot. It's a lot to
[1:39:02] take in. But are you willing?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Are you ready,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; my Christian friend? Are you really sure
[1:39:08] that your life is so reflecting for
[1:39:10] Christ? No matter what the world says,
[1:39:11] they say you lost your mind. You gone
[1:39:13] crazy. You went join that bunch of holy
[1:39:15] rollers. Don't you pay no attention to
[1:39:17] that.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; If you're not truly saved, he's in that
[1:39:20] body and the word of God in you and
[1:39:21] reflecting itself and the life of Christ
[1:39:23] reflecting out of you. Brother, sister,
[1:39:25] don't you take that chance. I don't care
[1:39:28] what you are, what kind of experience
[1:39:29] you have. Let that word reflect through
[1:39:31] you each day
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; because God in this last day is taking a
[1:39:34] bride for his son, Jesus Christ.
[1:39:37] Yes.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; So again, it's very simple. Lord, help
[1:39:39] me to become what you wrote.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; in flesh again,
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; in the portion of the bride that I can
[1:39:51] fulfill.
[1:39:53] Hallelujah.
[1:39:55] If Isaiah and the other prophets, now
[1:39:57] listen,
[1:39:59] had spoken, this is important.
[1:40:01] If they had spoken but he never came
[1:40:05] then their word would have been no
[1:40:07] different than Buddha's word.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; It been no different than Muhammad's
[1:40:11] word
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; if he had never came.
[1:40:17] He came.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:21] And he spoke.
[1:40:23] And he didn't just speak the word they
[1:40:25] spoke. He was the word
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; that they spoke.
[1:40:30] In fact, when he was standing there on
[1:40:32] trial,
[1:40:35] he didn't stand there and say, "I am the
[1:40:37] word."
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Haven't you read Psalm 22? Haven't you
[1:40:40] read all these scriptures?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; See, we think we got to defend ourselves
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; or even defend the message. Let your
[1:40:46] life defend the message.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus stood there and said like a a lamb
[1:40:53] before the shears, he was he he didn't
[1:40:55] open his mouth,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:58] He stood there and he and they accused
[1:41:00] him of all kinds of things. They said,
[1:41:01] "Don't you have anything to say?" Oh my.
[1:41:04] But he stood there quietly. Why? He was
[1:41:07] the word.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; The very fact that they were accusing
[1:41:11] him was fulfilling the word.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; The fact that he would be nailed to a
[1:41:14] tree was fulfilling the word.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; The fact that he would suffer the pain,
[1:41:18] all it was fulfilling the word. And he
[1:41:20] had perfectly resigned himself. Not my
[1:41:22] will, Lord, but thine be done to the
[1:41:24] will of God for the day and hour that he
[1:41:26] lived in. Hope we can only get a people
[1:41:28] today who say, "Lord, not my will, but
[1:41:30] thine be done."
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That's got to come by revelation. You
[1:41:36] can be raised in the message and but if
[1:41:37] you never have a revelation of it,
[1:41:39] you'll try to take every shortcut, try
[1:41:40] to get out of it. But our sister told
[1:41:42] her testimony the other day. How did she
[1:41:44] come? And she began to hear the word and
[1:41:46] and and she began to do things and then
[1:41:48] suddenly suddenly that something hit her
[1:41:50] when she was hearing some people speak
[1:41:52] about why they dressed the way they did.
[1:41:54] It hit her. She said, "I want to be like
[1:41:55] that. I want to dress like something
[1:41:57] come in your heart. Something's got to
[1:41:59] come in your heart.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; He came and he spoke and he was the word
[1:42:08] that they he was the word the prophet
[1:42:10] spoke. So Jesus was the vindication of
[1:42:13] the prophet's word.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Let me let me go a little bit further.
[1:42:18] If the prophet only spoke in this age
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; and we never came
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; then the prophet would have failed.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; I love this message.
[1:42:39] But if the messenger talked about a
[1:42:42] pastor
[1:42:44] in a church preaching over the pulpit
[1:42:47] and and he talked about that and the
[1:42:49] Bible teaches that and he talks about
[1:42:51] that then
[1:42:55] if I don't do what he said
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; then the prophet failed
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; no matter how much we love what he said
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; right there had to be a manif
[1:43:05] manifestation of it
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; right
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; hear ye him Yes.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; The word made flesh.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; We want to hear the message. We want to
[1:43:14] do the message.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Listen. If if a if if a woman never
[1:43:18] dressed right and act right, if a man
[1:43:20] never treated his family right.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Then what good did a prophet's message
[1:43:24] do?
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Right. If we weren't a witness in our
[1:43:28] community, I know there's been many who
[1:43:30] weren't.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; But let me be one who is. Yeah.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Let me be one who's loving and kind and
[1:43:35] patient and longsuffering and lives for
[1:43:39] other people.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Let me be one.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[1:43:44] Everybody wants to be the word and say,
[1:43:46] "Well, I'll heal the sick and raise the
[1:43:48] dead." But do you want to be the word
[1:43:50] when you got to keep your mouth shut? Do
[1:43:51] you want to be the word when you got to
[1:43:53] live for him in every part of your life?
[1:43:55] That's right.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be Jesus on the
[1:44:00] mountain when the glory of God come on
[1:44:02] him. But who wants to be Jesus at the
[1:44:04] cross?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And his prophecy is vindicated
[1:44:12] when the bride speaks.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; When the bride lives.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Just as God took Jesus to the mountain
[1:44:19] to say, "This is my adopted son." What
[1:44:21] did he say? He speaks for me.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. He speaks for me. So the
[1:44:26] bride must be taken by the message of
[1:44:28] this hour.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; And can I say it like this? To Sunset
[1:44:31] Mountain.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Right. We had to be taken to Mount
[1:44:35] Sunset to have him declare through the
[1:44:37] opening of the word. Listen, I didn't
[1:44:39] have to go there myself. I believe what
[1:44:41] a prophet said about it. I believe what
[1:44:43] happened. I believe what the picture
[1:44:44] that we saw that was taken of it. I
[1:44:47] believe that God supernaturally did
[1:44:49] that. People can say what they want to.
[1:44:51] I believe.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And because I believe, what is it? I
[1:44:55] believe that now I've been taken to
[1:44:57] Mount Sunset to have him declare through
[1:44:59] the opening of the word. Listen, he
[1:45:01] wasn't telling us just who a prophet
[1:45:03] was. He was saying, "This is my bride.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him."
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; The same God that spoke through Jesus
[1:45:10] and the prophets, the same God that
[1:45:12] spoke through William Brandom, that same
[1:45:14] God wants to speak through your lips and
[1:45:16] mine. Amen.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Say, "This is my beloved bride. She
[1:45:21] speaks for me."
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Now, you you can believe what you want
[1:45:25] to about that. I believe that we are
[1:45:29] living in that time.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; We just got to participate in it.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we're waiting on another
[1:45:36] messenger to come
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; to bring us to our Mount
[1:45:40] Transfiguration.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that happened.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Our adoption is this message.
[1:45:49] Its vindication
[1:45:51] is our vindication,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; And our life is the vindication of the
[1:45:58] message,
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; We are the word
[1:46:02] made flesh.
[1:46:05] I, brother Brandon, Sister Charity are
[1:46:07] here. I don't mean to single y'all out,
[1:46:08] but they told me a story about seven
[1:46:11] years ago about their daughter. Hope
[1:46:14] it's okay about their daughter who was
[1:46:16] healed who was they thought she was
[1:46:19] dead. She was laying there without any
[1:46:21] response in the hospital and a little
[1:46:24] sister from a message church heard a
[1:46:27] prayer request that was given and she
[1:46:29] went and showed up at the hospital
[1:46:33] and she laid her hands on the baby.
[1:46:35] Graceland is here this morning. laid her
[1:46:38] hands on the baby and and prayed prayed
[1:46:40] with them and and when they did what
[1:46:42] happened, the baby was healed
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; because she's here today with no no
[1:46:48] effects of that.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful testimony. They'll tell
[1:46:51] it to you sometime.
[1:46:53] But it think about this and as I was
[1:46:56] thinking about this sermon I thought
[1:46:57] that's was God
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; living in the flesh of somebody
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; who just listened to that voice that
[1:47:04] said go and pray in another city for a
[1:47:06] family you've never met for pe somebody
[1:47:08] you maybe never would meet but go and
[1:47:10] pray
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; lay your hands on some God don't want to
[1:47:13] just speak through a prophet he wants to
[1:47:15] speak through his bride
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; he don't want to just speak through a
[1:47:18] pastor he wants to speak through his
[1:47:20] bride
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham talked about a woman, a
[1:47:24] little child that was healed because of
[1:47:25] because a woman, he said, "Lay his hands
[1:47:27] laid her hands over on the baby and she
[1:47:29] was healed." And brother Brandon was
[1:47:31] there and that baby went through the
[1:47:32] prayer line. But when it finally went
[1:47:33] through the prayer line, he said, "It's
[1:47:35] already healed." Because that lady, that
[1:47:37] sister laid her hands on it.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; What was it? God working through his
[1:47:40] body. These are his hands. This is his
[1:47:43] mouth. Same with you. If you're a part
[1:47:45] of the body of Christ,
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; so we want to become that word. And I
[1:47:52] say, "Lord, let me
[1:47:55] lay down my thoughts."
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; My desires,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; "Let me be a help."
[1:48:03] Huh?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; And years later, it might make a
[1:48:07] difference.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; That person you prayed for may have been
[1:48:11] healed and you never knew it.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being emotional this
[1:48:17] morning, but I'm closing in just a
[1:48:18] moment. But but I I can think back over
[1:48:21] years of preaching and I started
[1:48:22] preaching when I was very young. I
[1:48:24] remember as a teenager preaching the
[1:48:25] gospel. Some of the people that I
[1:48:26] baptized and some of the people we
[1:48:28] worked with at Bransville, Brother JT
[1:48:30] and some of the folks that I worked with
[1:48:31] even before that over at over at Galia
[1:48:34] and over in there and and and I worked
[1:48:37] with those people in Mountain Home and I
[1:48:38] can remember Texar Cana. I worked with
[1:48:40] some of them baptized, some of them,
[1:48:42] prayed for some of them. I don't know
[1:48:43] where they're at today, but I know my
[1:48:45] God's a big God and his word will not go
[1:48:47] out void. And if I just do what God
[1:48:49] called me to do, he'll do what he
[1:48:51] promised he would do. And I believe what
[1:48:53] we have today is a fruit of God working
[1:48:55] in his body. Not in me only, but in the
[1:48:58] body, the entire body of Christ. He's
[1:49:00] working through each and every one of
[1:49:02] you to fulfill his word. Every one of
[1:49:04] you matter. You say, "Well, you you
[1:49:06] don't understand what I've been through
[1:49:07] my past and all those things." It
[1:49:09] doesn't matter. You're a part of the
[1:49:11] body of Christ. You matter when you're
[1:49:12] in the house of God because it might be
[1:49:15] the time for you to speak.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; This is my beloved bride. Hear ye her.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; The br said, "The same word spoke of the
[1:49:31] groom speaks of the bride." Well, how
[1:49:33] can the bride come and fail to manifest
[1:49:35] everything? Someone say everything. It
[1:49:37] was promised of him and the groom come.
[1:49:38] He wouldn't be the bride. when he did
[1:49:40] everything even to proving it by raising
[1:49:42] himself up from the dead afterwards then
[1:49:44] don't the bride have to do the same
[1:49:46] thing have to be exactly what the word
[1:49:48] said she would be in these last days
[1:49:50] don't she hallelujah don't she have to
[1:49:53] return listen he never said he would
[1:49:56] come back he said she had to return
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; glory to God don't she have to return
[1:50:02] through Malachi 4 don't she have to be
[1:50:04] manifested like it was in the days of
[1:50:06] Sodom don't the world have to be just
[1:50:08] exactly like it isn't these things, a
[1:50:10] perfect identification of the word of
[1:50:12] God made known to us.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; How can we do it? You said, "Brother
[1:50:16] Ben, how can I be the word made made
[1:50:17] flesh?" We got to be as sure of the
[1:50:19] scripture spoken about us as he was
[1:50:21] about himself.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Listen, he was so sure of Psalm 16:10.
[1:50:25] It said, "Thou will not leave my soul in
[1:50:27] hell. Neither wil thou suffer unholy one
[1:50:29] to see corruption." Jesus took that
[1:50:31] scripture and he said, "That's me."
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Right? He believed his own word.
[1:50:36] Hallelujah.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew that was he. no question in
[1:50:39] his mind. And he knew that 72 hours the
[1:50:42] body corrupts
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; and and he and he was going to come back
[1:50:45] to life again. So he said, "You destroy
[1:50:46] this temple. I'll raise it again in
[1:50:48] three days." Why? The word was written
[1:50:50] of him. It was written of him because he
[1:50:52] was the manifestation of God's written
[1:50:54] word for that day. Can you have that
[1:50:55] much confidence this morning? He is the
[1:50:57] God who heals all my diseases. He's the
[1:51:00] God who saves my children. When he said,
[1:51:02] "Thou thy house shall be saved." He's
[1:51:03] the God who brings me peace. He said he
[1:51:06] bring me peace beyond understanding
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; that passes understanding.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, there's got to be."
[1:51:16] Hallelujah. There's got to be, brother.
[1:51:17] Somewhere God's manifested word of God
[1:51:20] today. That's the same thing for he
[1:51:22] spoke of these days. He said, "What
[1:51:24] would take place in these days?" He has
[1:51:26] already told us. We know what's going to
[1:51:29] take place and we see it being
[1:51:30] manifested in you.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Huh? Do you ever think about it like
[1:51:35] that?
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; We see it being manifested in you that
[1:51:38] you're in God's church.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Don't sell yourself short this morning,
[1:51:42] church.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; See, every time you come to church,
[1:51:45] you're the fulfillment of Hebrews 10:25.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Don't forsake the assembling of
[1:51:49] yourselves together.
[1:51:52] How could something that's against that
[1:51:54] be the word of God?
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; It can't.
[1:51:59] Every time you lay hands on the sick,
[1:52:00] you're the fulfillment of Mark 16. How
[1:52:01] could someone who says we don't believe
[1:52:02] in healing anymore?
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; You're the fulfillment of Mark 16:18.
[1:52:06] Every time you lay hands on the sick,
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; ladies, you become the fulfillment of 1
[1:52:10] Timothy 2:9.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see it this morning. Come on,
[1:52:14] church.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; The fulfillment of 1 Timothy 2:9 talks
[1:52:16] about modesty and dress and things like
[1:52:18] that. Men and women become the
[1:52:20] fulfillment of Titus chapter 2 when he
[1:52:22] talks about how a man should act and how
[1:52:23] a young man should act and how how a
[1:52:26] woman should act, how a young woman
[1:52:27] should act. Every time he comes and
[1:52:29] heals us. Has he come and healed you
[1:52:31] many times? Every time he comes and
[1:52:34] something good happens.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; We are manifesting his word for today. I
[1:52:38] would cry out to you today. You are the
[1:52:40] word made flesh. Speak and go forward.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; He told Moses there at the at the the
[1:52:46] Red Sea. He said, "Don't cry. Speak
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; and go forward." He's taken you up on
[1:52:51] the mountain and said, "Speak for me."
[1:52:54] Hallelujah. Here you hear my son or
[1:52:57] daughter in the word age of life
[1:52:58] manifested the voice of many waters. He
[1:53:01] talks about in revelation. Listen
[1:53:02] brother Brandon said those in the bride
[1:53:04] do only his will. No one can make them
[1:53:06] do otherwise. They have thus sayeth the
[1:53:07] Lord or they keep still. They know that
[1:53:09] it has to be God in them doing the
[1:53:11] works. Fulfilling his own word.
[1:53:13] Musicians go ahead and come or I'll
[1:53:15] never quit. He did not complete all this
[1:53:17] work while in this earthly ministry. So
[1:53:19] now he works in and through the bride.
[1:53:21] You believe that today?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; She knows that. For it was not yet time
[1:53:24] for him to do certain things that he
[1:53:25] must now do. But he will now, someone
[1:53:27] say now, fulfill through the bride, that
[1:53:30] work which he left for this specific
[1:53:32] time. There's a work for you to do.
[1:53:34] There's somebody for you to lay hands
[1:53:35] on. There's somebody for you to speak
[1:53:37] the word over. There's somebody. He put
[1:53:39] you in your family, brother Paul, for a
[1:53:41] reason. You may not see the results of
[1:53:42] it even while you're living, but someday
[1:53:44] there's going to be a result. Why? He
[1:53:46] promised you your family. Are you with
[1:53:48] me now, church? Someday the bride is
[1:53:50] there's going to be a manifestation of
[1:53:52] the word. the bride speaks.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:59] There come a day organization, as I'm
[1:54:00] kind of skipping through these last
[1:54:02] quotes, the organization could no longer
[1:54:05] speak for God. They made dogmas and
[1:54:08] creeds and not simple word, but God sent
[1:54:11] Wesley and he was the voice with the
[1:54:13] word in his day.
[1:54:16] But when the Methodists failed, God
[1:54:17] raised up others. And so it has gone on
[1:54:19] through the years until in this last
[1:54:21] day.
[1:54:23] There is again another people in the
[1:54:25] land
[1:54:27] who are under their final messenger will
[1:54:28] be the final voice
[1:54:31] to the final age.
[1:54:35] When I am identified with the word I'm
[1:54:37] identified with him the head who came
[1:54:41] down to the body the authority that came
[1:54:43] to the body. I'm identified with the
[1:54:46] bridegroom.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah.
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:51] If we go down to that last quote,
[1:54:54] we're not looking at a future event.
[1:55:00] Brother Brandham ties that in Mount
[1:55:01] Transfiguration. He ties that to the
[1:55:03] opening of the words, opening of the
[1:55:04] seals in the Easter Seal 1965.
[1:55:08] And but he said not just a future event.
[1:55:10] He said now. Someone say now.
[1:55:14] in our bodies speaking with new tongues
[1:55:17] with prophesying for seeing laying hands
[1:55:19] on the sick recover the world dead and
[1:55:21] all the things of the world we passed
[1:55:23] from death to life we now hold the power
[1:55:28] hear ye him
[1:55:31] I want to tell you this morning if
[1:55:33] you've never if you've never come to
[1:55:35] that life that change that that that
[1:55:37] glorification if you will that moment of
[1:55:40] when his spirit comes in you and the
[1:55:42] token begins to be on display in your
[1:55:44] life. Hear him.
[1:55:47] Hear you him. The word made flesh.
[1:55:50] That's the thunder that shakes the
[1:55:52] devil. A life lived according to the
[1:55:55] word. A mature word born son or
[1:55:56] daughter. His son in the word age. His
[1:55:59] daughter in the word age quickened by
[1:56:01] the spirit like a spark that lit off of
[1:56:03] something to make it alive. Seated now
[1:56:05] in heavenly places in present tense
[1:56:07] already alive and made subject to every
[1:56:09] promise in the word. If I want to finish
[1:56:11] like we started,
[1:56:14] what is your attitude towards Jesus?
[1:56:20] Is he the same yesterday, today, and
[1:56:24] forever?
[1:56:25] What is your attitude towards the
[1:56:27] message today? Is it a historical thing?
[1:56:31] Is it just something that brother
[1:56:32] Brandham did? It's good. We can listen
[1:56:34] to it. What is the attitude? Or is it
[1:56:37] Christ?
[1:56:39] Oh, church.
[1:56:41] Is it some kind of religion like the
[1:56:44] Mormons or the Jehovah's Witnesses? Or
[1:56:46] is it Christ?
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe with all my heart it's
[1:56:50] Christ cuz it did not just write a book.
[1:56:52] He he he lived it. I'm so glad that God
[1:56:54] didn't just send us a a voice out of the
[1:56:56] heavens, but he sent a voice and a
[1:56:58] prophet so that I could see that he did
[1:57:00] not just preach, but he lived what he
[1:57:02] preached.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; And God didn't want just a people to
[1:57:05] hear it, but he wanted a people to
[1:57:07] manifest it. God didn't send a prophet
[1:57:09] for a prophet's sake, but he sent a
[1:57:11] prophet said, "Behold, I send you." Who
[1:57:14] was the you? It was me. That you was me.
[1:57:17] Behold, I send you, Elijah the prophet,
[1:57:19] before the coming of the great and
[1:57:20] dreadful day of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:57:22] I've taken that as me. He shall restore
[1:57:24] the heart of the children back to the
[1:57:26] Pentecostal fathers. My heart has been
[1:57:29] turned. So, I'm a vindication.
[1:57:32] Hallelujah. You're a vindication of God
[1:57:36] working in his body. Do you believe it
[1:57:37] this morning? Amen. Let's do something a
[1:57:40] little bit different this stand
[1:57:41] together. I want you to lay hands on one
[1:57:43] another. You're the body of Christ. The
[1:57:46] body of Christ. Lay hands on somebody
[1:57:48] beside you there.
[1:57:51] Oh, church.
[1:57:53] Maybe your husband or your wife or a
[1:57:56] loved one, a mother, an aged mother.
[1:58:02] Some of y'all sitting in the back. I see
[1:58:04] you there.
[1:58:06] our elders.
[1:58:08] I see some that have been struggling
[1:58:11] in body. I see some struggling in
[1:58:13] spirit.
[1:58:15] He is
[1:58:17] our Jehovah Gyra.
[1:58:20] He wants to speak through his body
[1:58:22] today.
[1:58:24] He wants to speak through his body. And
[1:58:26] we are the word made flesh. We are the
[1:58:29] message of the hours. They said, "Where
[1:58:31] is the Welsh revival?" And the man said,
[1:58:32] "I am the Welsh revival.
[1:58:35] We are the word made flesh. Hear you him
[1:58:37] this morning. Would you just pray for
[1:58:39] the person, not for yourself, but for
[1:58:40] the person you got your hands on, the
[1:58:42] people that you got your hands on. I
[1:58:44] pray for every one of you. We just
[1:58:46] believe that the Holy Spirit will begin
[1:58:47] to move in the bride body. If there's a
[1:58:49] need this morning, I believe he's going
[1:58:51] to meet it right now. And we can go
[1:58:53] rejoicing believing that God keeps his
[1:58:55] word. Heavenly Father, Lord, you you
[1:58:58] said, Lord, that they shall lay hands on
[1:58:59] the sick and they shall recover. Lord,
[1:59:01] that there's a sick one among us. Lord,
[1:59:03] hands are being laid on them. Not my
[1:59:05] hands, but the hands of your people. I
[1:59:07] pray, God, right now that you'd heal
[1:59:08] these sick people, oh God. I pray you'd
[1:59:10] bless these musicians, Lord. I pray
[1:59:12] you'd strengthen them, Lord. I pray
[1:59:14] you'd move for for our elders. I pray
[1:59:17] you'd strengthen their bodies. I pray
[1:59:18] for our young families, Lord, who face
[1:59:20] so much temptation and struggle in the
[1:59:22] world. I pray you'd protect our
[1:59:24] children. I pray you'd protect our young
[1:59:26] people, protect our families, Lord. Let
[1:59:28] that dad that goes to work, Lord, you
[1:59:30] see where he goes. that mom maybe that
[1:59:32] struggles that single mother or that's
[1:59:34] struggling so much. Oh God, I pray you'd
[1:59:36] reach down, heal them, Lord, touch their
[1:59:38] minds and their bodies. I pray you'd
[1:59:40] work right now in their midst. Oh God, I
[1:59:42] pray you'd do it now. Lord, we believe
[1:59:45] you today. You said the effectual
[1:59:47] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:59:48] availth much. I'm not righteous in
[1:59:50] myself. These people are not righteous
[1:59:52] in theirelves, but Lord, they are the
[1:59:54] body of Christ have been washed by the
[1:59:56] blood of the lamb, by the bleeding word.
[1:59:58] I pray God that we would speak today and
[2:00:00] every mountain would be moved. We pray
[2:00:03] in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:00:07] Hallelujah.
[2:00:09] Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] Oh, if you believe it's done, it's not
[2:00:12] about how we feel, but it's about what
[2:00:14] we believe. Let's just raise our hands
[2:00:16] to him and let and believe it now. Oh, I
[2:00:18] believe, Lord, that you met my need. I
[2:00:21] believe God that you heard my prayer.
[2:00:24] Hallelujah.
[2:00:26] Hallelujah.
[2:00:27] Oh, use me Lord. Help me to become your
[2:00:30] hands and your feet, oh God. We pray in
[2:00:33] Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If
[2:00:37] you need special prayer, the altar's
[2:00:38] open today. We love you in the name of
[2:00:41] the Lord.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just
[2:00:47] worship him a minute before we go now.
[2:00:49] Hallelujah.
[2:00:51] Oh, and even
[2:00:54] though it's humble. Oh, I thank you,
[2:00:58] Jesus.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, help my will to crumble,
[2:01:05] oh, and though the cost be great, I work
[2:01:12] for you. Sing the chorus again with all
[2:01:15] your heart now. Oh, make it your prayer,
[2:01:18] church. Won't you Jesus
[2:01:23] use me? Use me Lord. Help me to be the
[2:01:27] manifested word of God. Hallelujah. If
[2:01:30] you haven't received the baptism of the
[2:01:31] Holy Ghost, why don't you ask him for it
[2:01:33] today? If you need healing in your body,
[2:01:36] why don't you believe that he healed you
[2:01:37] there on Calvary? That he bought your
[2:01:39] healing. Hallelujah. He is our healer.
[2:01:42] Hear ye him this morning. Hear the word
[2:01:45] of God that speaks away depression and
[2:01:47] anxiety. Hear the one who can speak in
[2:01:50] your life. Thank you Lord Jesus. Oh help
[2:01:55] my will. Hallelujah.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Jesus. Oh glor
[2:02:03] be great power
[2:02:07] for you.

[2:02:17] used
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:24] refusing.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; For surely
[2:02:29] there's a work that I can do.

[2:02:40] And even even though
[2:02:44] it's humble,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, help my will to crumble.
