[51:56] was a wednesday night
[51:58] when he was supposed to be turkey
[52:00] hunting

[52:13] felt the presence of the lord like i did
[52:15] on a wednesday night service with just a
[52:17] handful of us here
[52:18] but god bless i believe god can move

[57:21] amen and amen god bless you this evening
[57:24] if you have your bibles while you're
[57:25] standing with us
[57:26] we want to turn to the book of proverbs
[57:28] the fourth chapter
[57:29] and we also want to look in the book of
[57:31] john the seventh chapter
[57:33] but here in the book of proverbs 4 we'd
[57:35] like to read first
[57:36] we want to greet you all in the name of
[57:37] the lord jesus christ we sure counted
[57:40] an honor and a privilege to be here with
[57:42] you this evening we
[57:43] appreciate brother ben appreciate his
[57:44] friendship and his stand
[57:46] upon the message and the pulpit here to
[57:48] stand for the message of the hour
[57:50] and that we sure want to say god bless
[57:52] him and his family and the church here
[57:53] and the
[57:54] work that the lord is doing and we've
[57:56] just come to amen put our shoulder to
[57:58] the wheel
[57:58] amen and to do all that we can to see
[58:00] the kingdom of god further advanced amen
[58:02] and
[58:03] also brother josh should text me today
[58:06] and ask me to greet you all for him so
[58:08] sure want to do that i know he would
[58:10] love to be here but we sure sure
[58:13] appreciate him and
[58:14] we want to look here in the book of
[58:15] proverbs the fourth chapter and i don't
[58:17] know what's happening but i'm losing
[58:18] everything in my ear so if you can put
[58:20] it back in my ear i appreciate it
[58:21] proverbs 4
[58:23] and verse 23 the bible says keep thy
[58:26] heart
[58:27] with all diligence for out of it
[58:30] are the issues of life now i think that
[58:33] heart is a very serious a very serious
[58:35] organ in the body don't you
[58:37] then actually solomon would write here
[58:38] and say keep thy heart with all
[58:40] diligence or keep thyself watch over thy
[58:42] heart
[58:43] for out of it are the issues of life now
[58:46] if you look with me in the book of john
[58:48] the seventh chapter
[58:50] john 7 and verse 38
[58:53] john 7 and verse 38
[58:56] we want to look there
[58:59] a very very familiar scripture there in
[59:01] john the seventh chapter
[59:04] is actually when jesus is just finished
[59:06] here at the feast
[59:07] and he stood and cried if any man
[59:09] thirsted him coming to me and drink and
[59:11] in the 38th verse
[59:12] of john 7 he's going to say he that
[59:16] believeth on me
[59:18] as the scripture said out of his belly
[59:21] shall flow somebody say shall flow he
[59:24] that believeth on me as a scripture said
[59:26] out of his bellies shall flow
[59:28] rivers of living water we asked the lord
[59:31] this evening to add the blessing to the
[59:33] reading of his word
[59:34] as you may have your seats here for just
[59:36] a few moments this evening if the lord
[59:38] would help me
[59:39] from those scriptures if i would have a
[59:41] title tonight i want to speak to you for
[59:43] a few moments here on unclogging
[59:46] the channels unclogging the channels and
[59:48] i
[59:49] i think tonight that there is a present
[59:51] time or a season we're living in we know
[59:53] there's actually four seasons of the
[59:55] of the year we have a fall we have a
[59:57] winter we have a spring and then we have
[59:59] a summer and those seasons they rotate
[1:00:02] and so actually the time we're living in
[1:00:03] is actually a time or season that's
[1:00:05] actually known
[1:00:06] when people actually get inspired to
[1:00:08] begin to clean things they actually call
[1:00:09] it spring cleaning or
[1:00:11] going through the house and get rid of
[1:00:12] things and it's actually a time
[1:00:14] of purging when they're actually
[1:00:16] cleaning out things and making room for
[1:00:18] something else actually
[1:00:19] what's happening is there's some things
[1:00:21] that's accumulating amen and those
[1:00:23] things have got to be moved aside for
[1:00:24] more to come
[1:00:25] in actually what they're doing is
[1:00:27] they're making room for more and brother
[1:00:28] brown
[1:00:29] actually preaches a message actually
[1:00:30] preaches it several times
[1:00:32] amen on doors and he'll actually call it
[1:00:34] door to the heart
[1:00:35] or doors in a door and what he does is
[1:00:37] he clearly identifies that there are
[1:00:39] many doors in the heart he says there's
[1:00:41] a door
[1:00:42] a man of pride there's a door of the
[1:00:44] private life
[1:00:45] he said then there's a door of faith he
[1:00:47] said there's all kinds of doors
[1:00:48] and he said in the heart of the human
[1:00:50] being all those doors are there
[1:00:52] because god is wanting to gain entrance
[1:00:55] he's wanting to get
[1:00:56] access he's wanting to get in behind
[1:00:57] those doors amen to manifest himself so
[1:01:00] when when saw solomon would say in
[1:01:02] proverbs 4 he meant to keep thy heart
[1:01:05] with all diligence he's actually
[1:01:07] been saying that behind there is a place
[1:01:09] god is going to get god is not just
[1:01:11] wanting to get in the flesh or just to
[1:01:12] get in the spirit
[1:01:14] amen but god is actually desiring to get
[1:01:16] into the heart
[1:01:17] amen of mankind the prophet said let my
[1:01:20] listen my christian friend
[1:01:21] if there's any alt in your heart against
[1:01:23] anyone go to them now and be reconciled
[1:01:26] forget all the past
[1:01:27] he said and if you've been having an up
[1:01:29] and down life remember
[1:01:30] something amen has come into that heart
[1:01:33] something has moved into these thoughts
[1:01:35] he meant no matter what who your enemy
[1:01:37] is you love him
[1:01:38] love him no matter no matter what's
[1:01:40] happened amen you let it go
[1:01:42] after all you're in a field with weeds
[1:01:44] and we realize that but we must grow
[1:01:47] together he said we've got to come up
[1:01:49] together he said for a good whale
[1:01:51] amen cannot pour forth evil waters
[1:01:54] neither can an
[1:01:55] evil whale amen pour forth good water
[1:01:57] see a tree cannot bring forth corrupt
[1:01:59] fruit
[1:02:00] and good fruit at the same time he said
[1:02:02] so let's either make the whole well
[1:02:04] clean or make the whole well dirty
[1:02:07] amen one or the other for it is dirty to
[1:02:10] begin with
[1:02:11] amen so let's clean out the whales this
[1:02:13] morning
[1:02:14] and say lord pour in your spirit and
[1:02:17] lead me o god
[1:02:18] amen lead me now think about this the
[1:02:20] prophet is saying there's not room
[1:02:22] amen in the well for dirty water and
[1:02:25] clean water there's not room in the well
[1:02:27] ain't meant for there to be stagnated
[1:02:28] water and fresh water there's not room
[1:02:30] in a tree
[1:02:31] ain't meant for there to be good fruit
[1:02:33] and corrupt fruit and let me amen let me
[1:02:35] just cut to the chase and say
[1:02:36] amen there's not room in the house of
[1:02:38] god amen for doubt and faith there's not
[1:02:41] room
[1:02:41] in the house of god for alts in our
[1:02:43] heart and in unbelief and unforgiveness
[1:02:45] amen i believe that time has come that
[1:02:47] god is desiring
[1:02:48] amen to pour out his spirit amen can you
[1:02:51] agree with me
[1:02:52] amen we're living in the time where god
[1:02:54] is desiring to pour out his spirit
[1:02:56] he meant not just to make the church
[1:02:58] jump or shout amen but where he could
[1:03:00] come back in the church
[1:03:01] he meant and there would not be room for
[1:03:03] anything else but christ
[1:03:05] he meant in christ alone my to think
[1:03:08] tonight that jehoshaphat had seen the
[1:03:09] results
[1:03:10] he meant of a life that served god in a
[1:03:12] life that did not serve god jehoshaphat
[1:03:15] witnessed that
[1:03:16] he meant in his own father think about
[1:03:18] that jehoshaphat saul
[1:03:20] amen what it was like one day for his
[1:03:22] father to serve god
[1:03:23] amen and then he saw what it was like
[1:03:25] the next day for his father not to serve
[1:03:27] god
[1:03:27] and it actually instilled something in
[1:03:29] him he meant to make room for one thing
[1:03:32] and that is serving god
[1:03:33] and may may i say that's a purpose in
[1:03:35] these meetings this weekend
[1:03:37] amen it's not to make room for a
[1:03:39] preacher not to make room for a church
[1:03:41] or to make room for a pastor
[1:03:42] amen but the purpose of these meetings
[1:03:44] amen is to make room for the living god
[1:03:47] he meant to come down in the church he
[1:03:49] met and defined the dwelling place
[1:03:51] mine the prophet said altogether he said
[1:03:53] jehoshaphat purpose where
[1:03:55] in his heart amen to serve the lord amen
[1:03:58] amen and declined to the things
[1:04:00] amen that his father david at the
[1:04:02] beginning i like that
[1:04:03] he meant at the beginning now think
[1:04:06] about this jehoshaphat
[1:04:08] amen was longing for the things amen
[1:04:10] that was at the beginning he was not
[1:04:12] longing
[1:04:13] he'd been for the half-hearted things he
[1:04:15] meant he was longing for the original
[1:04:17] things and i
[1:04:18] i think there's a longing in the heart
[1:04:19] of the church of the living god tonight
[1:04:21] amen we're not longing for half-hearted
[1:04:23] religion we're not longing for halfway
[1:04:26] services amen but there is a cry in our
[1:04:28] heart that is saying god
[1:04:30] you're still god and your word is still
[1:04:32] true
[1:04:33] and your power is still here and what
[1:04:34] you did before
[1:04:36] and then you're able to do it again let
[1:04:38] me just go and claim it for these
[1:04:39] meetings
[1:04:40] jesus christ it's the same yesterday
[1:04:43] amen today and forever
[1:04:45] amen and that word yesterday means
[1:04:47] whatever he was
[1:04:48] he meant up into this present time is
[1:04:50] what he'll be today
[1:04:52] and he'll be forever amen our god is not
[1:04:54] a man that he can lie
[1:04:56] amen neither is he the son of man that
[1:04:58] he can repent amen then god is calling
[1:05:00] us
[1:05:01] amen to search our hearts he meant to
[1:05:04] search our hearts
[1:05:05] amen for a full dedication see in other
[1:05:08] words what he done
[1:05:10] was he went back to the old landmark he
[1:05:12] meant he went back
[1:05:13] to house of hats amen went back to the
[1:05:16] old landmark
[1:05:17] and then he began to clean out the rolls
[1:05:20] he meant it would be good he said for
[1:05:21] pentecost
[1:05:22] he meant to go back to the old landmark
[1:05:24] amen amen it would be good for all of us
[1:05:26] to go back to the old landmarks
[1:05:28] amen and clean out the roles amen how
[1:05:31] many can agree that in your life you've
[1:05:33] got a landmark somewhere
[1:05:36] in your life somewhere you've got a
[1:05:38] landmark now you know what happens
[1:05:40] amen as things get between amen you and
[1:05:43] the landmark
[1:05:44] amen amen things get between you where
[1:05:46] you can't see the landmark
[1:05:47] amen then when trouble's coming when
[1:05:49] trials come and when situations come
[1:05:51] amen when you cannot lay your eyes upon
[1:05:54] the landmark
[1:05:55] amen then you get all scared or you get
[1:05:57] nervous amen but god is calling a church
[1:05:59] tonight
[1:06:00] amen who will rise up in faith and will
[1:06:02] clean out everything
[1:06:04] between them and the old landmark and
[1:06:06] say there's something there that'll hold
[1:06:07] me
[1:06:08] in the time of trouble he said i'm
[1:06:10] talking i suppose mostly
[1:06:11] amen to pentecostal people this
[1:06:13] afternoon amen went back to the old
[1:06:15] landmark he said now you talk about it
[1:06:17] cleaning up
[1:06:18] he said there'd be one around the
[1:06:19] pentecost church it sure would
[1:06:21] now how many knows that's the truth he
[1:06:24] said there'd certainly be
[1:06:25] a reformation going on oh how people
[1:06:28] would be acting different
[1:06:29] amen they would be dressing different
[1:06:31] they would be talking different
[1:06:33] it'd just be all together a different
[1:06:35] church if we went back to the old
[1:06:37] landmark
[1:06:38] amen where we started from amen let me
[1:06:40] say we didn't start amen from a division
[1:06:43] we didn't start from a fuss we didn't
[1:06:45] start from an argument we started on the
[1:06:47] day of pentecost
[1:06:48] he meant in the book of acts and that is
[1:06:50] where the church has got to go back to
[1:06:52] that's the only church that god claims
[1:06:54] as his home
[1:06:56] now when i begin to think about channels
[1:06:57] how how can i think about all the
[1:06:59] channels
[1:07:00] amen that's in the body of christ and
[1:07:02] god put those channels in his body
[1:07:04] amen because he's wanting to flow
[1:07:06] through them amen now when you begin to
[1:07:08] talk about a channel you have to realize
[1:07:09] that a channel
[1:07:10] amen is a prepared route he meant for
[1:07:13] something to pass through
[1:07:15] into something else think about that a
[1:07:17] channel is a prepared route
[1:07:20] he meant for something to pass from one
[1:07:22] thing into another
[1:07:23] amen a channel is a prepared so it's not
[1:07:26] something haphazardly
[1:07:28] it's not something that can just be done
[1:07:30] amen but it's actually prepared
[1:07:32] amen because god works through channels
[1:07:36] can you say amen amen god works through
[1:07:39] channels now think about this god
[1:07:41] prepares them channels and the devil
[1:07:43] does everything he can
[1:07:45] he meant to clog them up and then god
[1:07:47] prepares his channels
[1:07:49] and the devil does everything he can to
[1:07:52] clog them up
[1:07:53] amen now a channel becomes clogged up it
[1:07:55] means
[1:07:56] it's blocked amen so that little or
[1:07:58] nothing can pass through it
[1:08:00] amen so to unclog something means you've
[1:08:02] got to remove
[1:08:04] amen all the accumulated matter amen
[1:08:07] from it you've got to remove some things
[1:08:09] you can't just mix everything and put
[1:08:11] everything together
[1:08:12] amen but you've got to remove some
[1:08:14] things amen in order for the for the
[1:08:16] life to flow through that channel
[1:08:18] and i believe that another word for
[1:08:20] unclogging could be
[1:08:21] revival amen i believe another word for
[1:08:24] unclogging channels
[1:08:25] amen could be revival amen a revival is
[1:08:28] to wash all the unbelief
[1:08:30] amen in the trash out the prophet said
[1:08:32] and let the people come out
[1:08:34] amen night after night and see that god
[1:08:37] is still god
[1:08:38] amen for i am the lord and i change not
[1:08:41] therefore ye
[1:08:42] sons of jacob amen are not consumed
[1:08:45] amen now let me just stop here and say
[1:08:47] the channel of god is always
[1:08:49] open amen it's not we're not here trying
[1:08:52] to open the channel of god the channel
[1:08:54] of god
[1:08:55] is always open and then the prophet said
[1:08:57] remember church
[1:08:58] god's words are true and i believe the
[1:09:01] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:09:03] promise of god
[1:09:04] will bring it to pass if you can look at
[1:09:07] it in the right way
[1:09:08] but remember this the first thing i want
[1:09:10] to find out
[1:09:11] is whether it's the will or god or will
[1:09:13] of god or not now think about this
[1:09:15] then i know it's god's will so the very
[1:09:18] first thing the
[1:09:19] for is to find out is it the will of god
[1:09:22] or is it not
[1:09:24] but let me go ahead and give you the
[1:09:25] answer it is god's will
[1:09:27] that you have revival amen the next
[1:09:30] thing is
[1:09:30] my objective to it and my motive in
[1:09:33] doing it he
[1:09:34] said then if it's the will of god and my
[1:09:36] objective is right and my motive is
[1:09:38] right
[1:09:38] then i have faith that it'll be done
[1:09:41] amen see we we've got this settled
[1:09:43] tonight that it's the will of god
[1:09:45] amen that we have a revival and our
[1:09:47] motive and our objective
[1:09:48] amen is to seek god glorified amen to
[1:09:51] see souls set free
[1:09:52] amen to see hearts filled with the holy
[1:09:54] ghost amen to see
[1:09:56] life come into empty vessels amen we've
[1:09:58] got the will of god church
[1:10:00] amen we've got the right motive and the
[1:10:02] right objective amen then what is left
[1:10:04] for revival to take place
[1:10:06] he said here it is you've got to have
[1:10:08] the faith that it's going to be done
[1:10:10] amen anybody want to go and testify
[1:10:12] based on faith tonight
[1:10:14] that somebody's going to get healed in
[1:10:15] these meetings amen somebody's going to
[1:10:18] get the holy ghost in these meetings
[1:10:20] and then somebody is going to break out
[1:10:22] of a prison house
[1:10:23] and then the devil's held them into for
[1:10:25] years right here in these meetings amen
[1:10:28] i'm not saying this based upon feelings
[1:10:30] or sensation
[1:10:31] i am claiming this amen based upon the
[1:10:33] will of god
[1:10:34] which the prophet said his will is his
[1:10:37] word
[1:10:38] his will is his word amen he said if you
[1:10:41] have a selfish motive
[1:10:43] then it won't work amen it won't work if
[1:10:45] your objective is to make money for
[1:10:47] yourself or something
[1:10:48] you'll never succeed he said then trying
[1:10:50] to do something outside
[1:10:52] of the will of the lord then it won't
[1:10:54] work to begin with
[1:10:55] amen amen so there is genuine faith
[1:10:58] but you must come into the real channel
[1:11:01] of god to have
[1:11:03] that genuine faith now there is human
[1:11:05] faith
[1:11:06] amen then there's the faith of god he
[1:11:08] said and you must somebody shout must
[1:11:12] you must have a godly faith to believe
[1:11:14] now then to have godly faith
[1:11:16] amen you must have said again you must
[1:11:19] amen you must have the mind of christ
[1:11:22] in you he said then that's how god amen
[1:11:25] projects to you visions
[1:11:27] and revelations and all these things
[1:11:29] comes amen by the mind of christ
[1:11:32] amen being in you he said do you get it
[1:11:35] let the mind that was in christ amen be
[1:11:38] in you now brother
[1:11:39] we have now found the key to revival
[1:11:41] it's not the preacher
[1:11:43] it's not the building it's not the
[1:11:45] singers amen it's not the attendance
[1:11:47] amen the key to revival is when the mind
[1:11:50] of christ
[1:11:51] amen comes into the church oh thank god
[1:11:54] amen that's the key to revival
[1:11:56] amen when the mind of christ comes into
[1:11:58] you
[1:11:59] to agree with his will concerning your
[1:12:01] life
[1:12:02] amen you want to you want to go into a
[1:12:04] shout and fit amen let the preacher say
[1:12:06] amen that you aren't free and let the
[1:12:09] word say you were free
[1:12:10] and let your heart agree with what the
[1:12:12] word is saying and what the anointed man
[1:12:14] of god is saying
[1:12:15] and there'll be a revival breaking your
[1:12:17] heart amen that the devil won't be able
[1:12:20] to hold back
[1:12:20] what will it be church it'll be moving
[1:12:23] from the unseen
[1:12:24] amen unseen promises into the seen
[1:12:26] promises
[1:12:27] now let me preach that for a second all
[1:12:29] these promises of god are unseen
[1:12:31] amen but you look at the unseen until
[1:12:34] you step into that real my faith
[1:12:36] and by faith the unseen becomes the
[1:12:38] scene and you can testify
[1:12:40] but for one physical manifestation you
[1:12:43] can testify
[1:12:44] ain't been the answers on this way amen
[1:12:46] the healing is on its way
[1:12:48] they've been the deliverances on its way
[1:12:50] my we'll never find the channel of god
[1:12:53] without the mind of god we'll never
[1:12:57] find the channel of god without the mind
[1:13:00] of god
[1:13:01] that's why paul will come along and say
[1:13:03] who hath known
[1:13:04] amen the mind of the lord that he may
[1:13:07] instruct him
[1:13:08] amen let me say this i am preaching to
[1:13:10] you tonight but i'm doing more than
[1:13:12] preaching
[1:13:13] amen i am instructing you amen on how to
[1:13:16] receive a revival brother andrew how can
[1:13:18] you stand there
[1:13:19] and so boldly say that you are
[1:13:21] instructing the church
[1:13:23] amen because paul says we have the mind
[1:13:26] of christ
[1:13:27] amen if we didn't have the mind of
[1:13:29] christ then i'm giving you andrew
[1:13:30] glover's opinions
[1:13:32] and ben pruitt's ideas amen but when a
[1:13:34] prophet of god stood
[1:13:35] and said here is the secret amen the
[1:13:38] word
[1:13:38] is in the pride as it was in mary amen
[1:13:42] the bride has the mind of christ
[1:13:44] amen for she knows what he wants done
[1:13:47] with his word
[1:13:48] she performs the command of the word in
[1:13:51] his name are you ready
[1:13:52] for she has amen thus saith
[1:13:56] the lord amen that's a sound point right
[1:13:58] there
[1:13:59] amen we're not waiting for thus saith
[1:14:01] the lord to come
[1:14:02] we didn't have thus saith the lord amen
[1:14:04] but right here
[1:14:05] in the month of may in the year of 2021
[1:14:09] brother peter we have got amen the mind
[1:14:12] of christ
[1:14:12] amen by the message of the hour
[1:14:16] oh and the word is quickened amen by the
[1:14:19] spirit
[1:14:20] it comes to pass amen see like a seed
[1:14:23] that is planted and watered it comes to
[1:14:25] full harvest
[1:14:26] amen serving its purpose amen let me
[1:14:29] just take a minute here and say
[1:14:30] i'm not here to waste your time amen i'm
[1:14:33] here to preach the message
[1:14:34] amen if we're not going to preach the
[1:14:36] message we might as well go to the
[1:14:37] coffee house
[1:14:38] and get a cup of coffee amen because
[1:14:40] nothing else in the world
[1:14:42] has got the mind of christ but the
[1:14:44] message of the hour
[1:14:45] amen no psychologist amen no deformer
[1:14:48] no doctor amen but jesus christ the son
[1:14:51] of man
[1:14:52] has come down in this generation to
[1:14:54] release the church
[1:14:56] that the power of god and the revelation
[1:14:58] of god could flow through the church
[1:15:00] once again
[1:15:00] my the channel of god is open amen but
[1:15:03] it's our channels that get clogged up
[1:15:07] don't get caught on me it's our channels
[1:15:09] that get clogged up
[1:15:11] amen do you realize in genesis 4 you'll
[1:15:13] find the first two boys
[1:15:14] and then we're trying to find the
[1:15:16] channel of god they meant the channel of
[1:15:18] god was not blocked off
[1:15:20] he meant but religion and tradition
[1:15:23] blocked it off to one
[1:15:24] whose name was cain right and the bible
[1:15:26] says by faith abel
[1:15:28] offered unto god a more what
[1:15:31] excellent sacrifice amen than cain by
[1:15:34] which he obtained the witnesses
[1:15:36] that he was righteous god testified of
[1:15:39] his gifts
[1:15:40] and by it he being dead amen yet
[1:15:43] speaketh
[1:15:43] now the prophet said cain was just as
[1:15:46] religious as abel was
[1:15:48] they both built altars they both loved
[1:15:50] god they both made sacrifices
[1:15:52] they both worshipped are you ready they
[1:15:54] both paid their tithe
[1:15:55] amen they both done everything alike
[1:15:58] amen but
[1:15:59] able by faith which is the revelation
[1:16:02] amen the word of god revealed made plain
[1:16:06] showed out and vindicated amen i'll tell
[1:16:08] you what i'm looking for this weekend
[1:16:10] amen is the word of god he meant to be
[1:16:13] made plain
[1:16:14] amen to show out and to be vindicated
[1:16:17] and a prophet said glory amen by the
[1:16:20] true
[1:16:21] channel cain made an offering
[1:16:24] amen but god didn't vindicate it right
[1:16:27] amen see
[1:16:28] he meant god required worship and cain
[1:16:31] made the offering
[1:16:32] but god didn't vindicate it he meant but
[1:16:35] by the true channel
[1:16:37] you say well my church is it my wait
[1:16:39] just a minute god
[1:16:40] interprets his own word by its terms
[1:16:43] that he spoke in
[1:16:45] amen see there was a channel of god and
[1:16:47] there were two boys
[1:16:49] amen that were two channels amen looking
[1:16:51] for forgiveness
[1:16:52] amen looking for redemption amen looking
[1:16:55] for restoration
[1:16:56] amen and god was flowing out they meant
[1:16:59] exactly what they had need of
[1:17:01] and then but when that began to flow
[1:17:02] down king's channel they meant it was
[1:17:04] all clogged up
[1:17:05] with a bunch of accumulated fruits and
[1:17:07] pumpkins and melons and all kinds of
[1:17:09] things
[1:17:10] and the power of redemption could not
[1:17:12] pass through that channel
[1:17:14] amen but on the other side there was a
[1:17:16] man named abel
[1:17:17] amen who by revelation amen had a
[1:17:20] channel open
[1:17:21] that when god began to pour down
[1:17:23] redemption he meant cable could stand up
[1:17:26] and say thank you lord amen cain thought
[1:17:28] it was fruit that took us
[1:17:30] out and fruit they'll bring us back in
[1:17:32] amen but the blood
[1:17:34] is the only way back
[1:17:37] oh help me church have been the blood
[1:17:39] it's the only way back
[1:17:41] amen see the prophet said i am religious
[1:17:43] i am a lover of my maker
[1:17:45] i offer these it's fine altar i offer to
[1:17:48] you this sacrifice
[1:17:49] amen i built all these things up amen
[1:17:52] lord
[1:17:52] because i love you amen are you ready
[1:17:56] abel said the same thing now one was
[1:17:59] vindicated
[1:18:00] and one was proven and god come down
[1:18:03] let's say that together god come down
[1:18:06] amen god come down and received
[1:18:09] abel's sacrifice are you ready
[1:18:13] because by revelation he had struck
[1:18:17] the true channel of god that was
[1:18:20] accepted
[1:18:24] amen
[1:18:48] accumulated matter they've been out of
[1:18:50] those channels until the revelation of
[1:18:52] jesus christ
[1:18:54] amen could be transferred he meant from
[1:18:56] himself
[1:18:57] into his church let me say it like this
[1:19:00] god opened the channel
[1:19:01] of a prophetic gift in this generation
[1:19:04] amen by the fulfillment
[1:19:06] and the interpretation of his word
[1:19:10] now can i tell you what the prophet said
[1:19:12] amen he said when he placed me in this
[1:19:13] channel
[1:19:14] of this prophetic gift whatever it might
[1:19:16] be i do not know
[1:19:17] he said this bible is open here before
[1:19:20] me i do not want to just call it in the
[1:19:22] scripture
[1:19:22] brother hall them speaks much about it
[1:19:24] it's being some prophetic gift
[1:19:27] when he places upon me i try to glorify
[1:19:31] our heavenly father whatever i can
[1:19:34] to help his people that's what i do
[1:19:37] see then god sent the prophet in this
[1:19:40] age
[1:19:41] amen to open up the channel he meant
[1:19:43] where praise and glory
[1:19:45] would no longer be going to a man but it
[1:19:47] would be going back to god
[1:19:49] who is the giver of life to man my to
[1:19:52] thank god sent that prophetic gift
[1:19:54] amen to the bride of christ amen you
[1:19:56] ever wondered why he sent a prophetic
[1:19:58] gift
[1:19:59] amen to you because you had a prophetic
[1:20:01] womb
[1:20:02] amen that was going to bring forth a
[1:20:04] prophetic promise
[1:20:06] hey that's why the prophet would stand
[1:20:07] and say amen you're a different class of
[1:20:10] people
[1:20:10] you are a prophetic class of people
[1:20:14] now help me church amen you're not just
[1:20:16] common citizens
[1:20:18] amen you're prophet you say but then i'm
[1:20:20] just a young man
[1:20:21] you're a prophetic young man i'm just a
[1:20:23] young lady
[1:20:24] you're a prophetic young lady amen when
[1:20:26] we recognize the time
[1:20:28] and the hour we're living in and what a
[1:20:31] powerful covenant we are under
[1:20:33] you know what it should do it should
[1:20:35] move the church
[1:20:36] into action brother harvey it should
[1:20:38] move the church
[1:20:39] amen out of the slump of laodicea it
[1:20:42] should move the church
[1:20:43] out of the heaviness of the cares of
[1:20:45] life into a spot of action
[1:20:48] remember andrew you're saying amen when
[1:20:50] we recognize the covenant we're under
[1:20:52] amen amen it should move us into action
[1:20:54] well let me tell you what paul said
[1:20:55] about you if that's okay
[1:20:57] paul says in hebrews 8 6 but now amen
[1:21:00] have he obtained
[1:21:01] a more excellent ministry there's a amen

[1:21:28] covenant

[1:21:31] established amen upon better promises

[1:24:55] of forgetfulness

[1:35:33] indifferences
[1:35:38] i may get right out of town time i get
[1:35:39] done tonight but that's quite all right
[1:35:41] amen what's going to tear down the walls
[1:35:43] between fellowship and
[1:35:44] with believers
[1:35:48] you're going to pass it down to another
[1:35:50] generation if you don't do it
[1:35:52] well is it the truth are you we've got
[1:35:55] we've got
[1:35:56] kids in this message they've been
[1:35:58] talking about divisions in churches

[1:36:17] time to do it's time to quit being a
[1:36:19] nicolaitan
[1:36:20] and bury the battle axe and let the holy
[1:36:22] ghost
[1:36:23] come back in the church and flow with
[1:36:26] the power
[1:36:27] and the inspiration and the joy and the
[1:36:30] liberty
[1:36:31] and the power of revival i'm not a crazy
[1:36:34] man
[1:36:35] i'm a believer that believes there's
[1:36:37] dynamite in this message
[1:36:38] that'll clear out every channel and let
[1:36:41] the living god
[1:36:42] begin to flow through his church once
[1:36:44] again
[1:36:45] until we can say his hands or my hands
[1:36:49] his feet or my feet
[1:36:55] somewhere another you got to bury it
[1:37:02] ah oh god brother ben hope i don't get
[1:37:05] in trouble
[1:37:07] somewhere another you got to bury it
[1:37:10] or you're going to kill the next
[1:37:11] generation
[1:37:15] well they need to know about my hurts
[1:37:17] why can't you preach them some healing
[1:37:21] come on oh it's a pity party
[1:37:25] that's clogged up the churches to where
[1:37:27] preachers can't even shake hands no more
[1:37:29] because of some political indifference
[1:37:33] come on church
[1:37:35] amen i think it's a shame amen that our
[1:37:37] kids go to youth camps
[1:37:38] and they get a charge of the holy ghost
[1:37:40] and they come back to churches
[1:37:42] and they they get shut down and squashed
[1:37:44] out because so and so didn't believe in
[1:37:46] the move of god 30 years ago
[1:37:48] oh preach brother andrew think i believe
[1:37:50] i will
[1:37:51] i'm telling you church you want a
[1:37:53] revival kill that thing
[1:37:55] you want a revival let the holy ghost
[1:37:58] blow
[1:37:58] your petty indifference out of the water
[1:38:01] until joy
[1:38:02] takes the place of bitterness until
[1:38:04] happiness
[1:38:05] takes the place of sadness until healing
[1:38:08] takes the place of hurts
[1:38:12] it's gonna be passed down until somebody
[1:38:15] stands up and stops it
[1:38:19] well i i can't get off this
[1:38:24] i have literally brother ben i have
[1:38:26] literally stood
[1:38:27] amen and talked to people in this
[1:38:29] message kids young people
[1:38:31] said what do you hey you know why don't
[1:38:33] you once you do this
[1:38:34] well brother so-and-so told me that
[1:38:36] years ago brother so-and-so offended him
[1:38:39] so we just don't shake hands
[1:38:44] clogging up the channels
[1:38:49] and then you know what's the funny thing
[1:38:50] about it they clog up the channels and
[1:38:52] then blame other people that's in
[1:38:53] revival for their channels being clogged
[1:38:59] they letting differences in bitterness
[1:39:01] is this okay
[1:39:02] they they let petty differences on
[1:39:04] doctrines amen amen amen amen fill up
[1:39:07] the
[1:39:07] the channels until they come to church
[1:39:09] and they get behind the pulpit
[1:39:11] and there's no inspiration because the
[1:39:13] channel of god is clogged up with
[1:39:15] feelings and hurts and offenses
[1:39:18] amen there's no there's no movement of
[1:39:20] the holy ghost
[1:39:21] because the channels are all filled up
[1:39:23] with a bunch of nonsense
[1:39:24] amen and because god ain't doing nothing
[1:39:26] there amen they lash out at everybody
[1:39:28] else
[1:39:29] amen but can i give you a little word of
[1:39:30] advice amen blow your own channels out
[1:39:33] and get your own revival
[1:39:38] well brother andrew we just
[1:39:39] automatically believe it's going to be
[1:39:40] that way
[1:39:41] but the prophet said it's come to a
[1:39:43] place where you've got to quit believing
[1:39:45] that old formal way
[1:39:49] amen that old formal way that says this
[1:39:52] is the way it's going to be i'm here to
[1:39:54] tell you that jesus
[1:39:55] who is the way said that's not the way
[1:39:58] it's got to be
[1:40:05] what are you saying preacher i'm saying
[1:40:07] the spirit of truth
[1:40:09] has returned in this age to let you know
[1:40:12] you're not subject to believe that
[1:40:15] devils lie
[1:40:16] any longer
[1:40:20] what oh mercy what this john said
[1:40:23] brother andrew who you at i'm after
[1:40:25] nobody but a spirit
[1:40:28] and i'll not quit until that devil loses
[1:40:31] his grip
[1:40:32] on the hands of god's children i'll not
[1:40:35] back up until that demon is laying in
[1:40:37] defeat
[1:40:38] and bitternesses are healed and hurts
[1:40:40] her come on
[1:40:43] well howbeit amen when he the spirit of
[1:40:46] truth has come
[1:40:47] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:40:50] shall not speak of himself
[1:40:51] but whatsoever he shall hear amen that
[1:40:53] shall he speak
[1:40:55] and he will show you amen things to come
[1:40:58] see look what the spirit of truth is
[1:40:59] going to do he's going to turn
[1:41:01] your attention from the past
[1:41:06] to the future to show you
[1:41:09] things that was
[1:41:12] things that has been or things that is
[1:41:16] to come
[1:41:18] now the prophet picks this up and says
[1:41:20] for years
[1:41:21] we've got what we call a lie detector
[1:41:24] he said you put it on your wrist you set
[1:41:26] it across your head
[1:41:28] and you can get in there and you can try
[1:41:30] your best
[1:41:31] to make us lie sound like the truth and
[1:41:34] it'll register negative
[1:41:36] every time
[1:41:42] because a human was not made to lie
[1:41:47] lying is not an easy thing it's a hard
[1:41:50] deceitful thing it's an evil thing now a
[1:41:54] prophet of god
[1:41:54] said i'd rather have a drunk with me
[1:41:58] than a liar
[1:42:01] well put your seat belts on we're going
[1:42:03] to go through it your body wasn't made
[1:42:06] to lie
[1:42:07] no matter how sinful you are he said
[1:42:10] you're still a fallen son of god
[1:42:11] the most sinful person in this city
[1:42:13] today god
[1:42:15] didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted
[1:42:18] you to be a son
[1:42:19] or a daughter of his
[1:42:23] you're made up in his own makeup
[1:42:27] but sin has called you to do that
[1:42:31] you cannot tell the lie with that
[1:42:33] scientific instrument on you
[1:42:36] amen but it'll still register negative
[1:42:38] because there's a subconscious
[1:42:40] down in a human being and that
[1:42:43] subconscious knows the truth
[1:42:45] therefore if a man or a woman could ever
[1:42:48] get their thoughts
[1:42:49] and their testimony and their lives so
[1:42:52] lined up with god
[1:42:54] until the channel of the holy spirit
[1:42:57] would be perfectly one with god what
[1:42:59] would
[1:43:00] take place
[1:43:05] if you could get your thoughts your
[1:43:07] testimony
[1:43:08] and our lives lined up with god what
[1:43:11] could take place
[1:43:12] if the man and the woman could ever get
[1:43:15] lined up now you ready
[1:43:16] we're with freedom from their hearts
[1:43:21] and with faith from their innermost they
[1:43:24] come the author to be prayed for
[1:43:25] and all they've got is intellectual
[1:43:27] faith but when it comes from the heart
[1:43:29] all things are possible then
[1:43:33] see what happens brother harvey your
[1:43:36] confession
[1:43:37] meets up with your life and your life
[1:43:40] speaks as loud as your confession does
[1:43:42] but when your confession says one thing
[1:43:45] and your life lives another
[1:43:47] there's something wrong somewhere
[1:43:52] that's because you've got an
[1:43:54] intellectual faith
[1:43:56] and not a faith from the heart but that
[1:43:59] shows outside here
[1:44:00] is the knowledge of god are you ready
[1:44:03] but inside here
[1:44:05] is a demon of doubting i believe in
[1:44:07] divine healing
[1:44:08] but it's not for me it could be soul but
[1:44:11] i don't believe it
[1:44:12] get it outside you say yes but your
[1:44:15] conscience says no
[1:44:16] he said the scientific thing would prove
[1:44:19] that
[1:44:20] wasn't right now think about this
[1:44:24] the scientific thing will prove it's not
[1:44:27] right now watch this
[1:44:28] one of the one of satan's favorite
[1:44:30] channels he meant to clog
[1:44:32] up is the channel of inspiration now
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:35] brother i don't know if you can give me
[1:44:36] some more on these four monitors i'd
[1:44:37] sure appreciate it
[1:44:39] amen amen but there is a spirit in man
[1:44:41] now watch this job 32
[1:44:42] 8 there is a spirit in man and the
[1:44:45] inspiration
[1:44:47] of the almighty giveth him understanding
[1:44:50] now when brother man comes here and i
[1:44:51] have heard but now i see
[1:44:52] he actually takes time to refer back to
[1:44:55] the service previous
[1:44:56] on trying to do god a service
[1:45:00] without it being his will now watch this
[1:45:03] he said there's david just as inspired
[1:45:06] as could be
[1:45:07] all the people shouting thank you buddy
[1:45:08] and glorifying god
[1:45:10] for a reason that seemed exactly
[1:45:12] scripture but he was the wrong person
[1:45:14] he said the inspiration should have come
[1:45:16] to nathan he said job was the prophet in
[1:45:19] his day
[1:45:20] and the only thing god had done to job
[1:45:21] was always give him wisdom and his word
[1:45:24] and inspiration
[1:45:24] but he could get no inspiration but he
[1:45:27] knowed all of his mechanics his burn
[1:45:29] free everything was right but he
[1:45:31] couldn't get a word from god
[1:45:32] but the devil couldn't move him there
[1:45:35] you are
[1:45:36] see now there's where you are when
[1:45:37] you're paid for it you don't have to run
[1:45:39] back through the line
[1:45:41] or get let somebody else pray for you
[1:45:43] but when you know
[1:45:45] you've done exactly what god told you to
[1:45:48] do
[1:45:48] then you wait somebody say you wait then
[1:45:51] you
[1:45:51] wait for that channel of inspiration to
[1:45:55] open up to you
[1:45:56] and now i am healed
[1:46:00] glory to god are you hearing me church

[1:46:52] that inspired him to come for prayer is
[1:46:55] the same inspire
[1:46:56] that has inspired me to pray for him and
[1:46:59] when he leaves this altar
[1:47:00] and walks back to his seed that pain

[1:47:19] that moved me to pray for him is the
[1:47:21] same inspiration oh god

[1:48:45] god
[1:48:46] until he can sin the dead

[1:51:40] it's not a different bible it's the same
[1:51:43] inspire
[1:51:46] inspired them inspired us
[1:51:49] this to believe what he wrote
[1:51:52] are you all hearing me tonight no when a
[1:51:54] man is inspired
[1:51:56] and he reads the inspired word the two
[1:51:58] inspirations
[1:51:59] give a result
[1:52:05] when a man is inspired
[1:52:09] and he reads the inspired word isn't
[1:52:12] that good
[1:52:12] you're not placing brother david the
[1:52:14] inspiration upon
[1:52:16] the word it's already on it
[1:52:24] when you're down in the valley of
[1:52:26] valleys and the low of lows
[1:52:28] and you read this word you're not
[1:52:30] placing an anointing on this word
[1:52:32] to lift you up out of the valley the
[1:52:34] anointing is
[1:52:35] already on the word
[1:52:39] no matter how well you study it it'll
[1:52:42] never do you no good until you're
[1:52:44] inspired yourself
[1:52:46] the word let's say this together the
[1:52:47] word
[1:52:49] is already inspired
[1:52:52] so what we need today is an inspiration
[1:52:55] over us
[1:52:56] what are these meetings for it's not the
[1:52:59] building of a preacher
[1:53:00] it's not the building of the kingdom
[1:53:02] it's for the word
[1:53:04] that's inspired to send an inspiration
[1:53:06] over us
[1:53:07] amen god's sweeping down with a new
[1:53:10] inspiration and breathing over us his
[1:53:13] power
[1:53:14] and his love and himself that it might
[1:53:17] inspire us
[1:53:18] amen to quicken us and to awaken us to
[1:53:20] his word
[1:53:21] and then the word being brought into
[1:53:24] that
[1:53:24] inspiration then you'll see miracles
[1:53:27] happen
[1:53:28] and things will take place because the
[1:53:31] two
[1:53:31] has come together oh somebody shout the
[1:53:35] two
[1:53:36] has come together amen let's claim that
[1:53:39] tonight
[1:53:40] in this meeting amen the two has come
[1:53:43] together
[1:53:44] they've been the inspired word amen has
[1:53:47] come together
[1:53:48] with the bride of christ and those two
[1:53:50] inspirations brother

[1:53:56] church i'm not a crazy man i just happen
[1:53:59] to be in
[1:54:00] in the past few months in some
[1:54:02] old-fashioned holy ghost meetings

[1:55:59] my timer
[1:56:05] can i give you a witness can i give you
[1:56:08] a bible witness
[1:56:09] she's in mark 14. she's a woman
[1:56:14] who came and washed the feet of jesus
[1:56:20] do you realize when she got
[1:56:23] brother the carlton when she got to the
[1:56:26] feet of jesus
[1:56:28] she had nothing to do the service with
[1:56:38] she didn't have the water she didn't
[1:56:41] have the towel
[1:56:43] but she had read in her heart
[1:56:47] she had read in the word and in her
[1:56:50] heart
[1:56:51] was an inspiration laying there
[1:56:55] he still forgives sinners
[1:57:03] oh and she knew
[1:57:06] if i just get in his presence
[1:57:11] you know what the father said she had to
[1:57:12] do she had to elbow
[1:57:15] her way through the crown brother allen
[1:57:18] just to get at his feet
[1:57:20] she had to she had to kick this out of
[1:57:21] the way and she had she had to clean the
[1:57:23] channels out
[1:57:27] there was a lot in between her and that
[1:57:28] landmark
[1:57:31] oh thank you god there was a lot between
[1:57:34] her and that landmark
[1:57:35] and she had to move this doubter out of
[1:57:37] the way and she had to push this critic
[1:57:39] out of the way
[1:57:40] and she had to push this unbeliever out
[1:57:41] of the way and he had to push this
[1:57:43] skeptic out the way i had to push
[1:57:44] all these things out of the way
[1:57:48] no doubt brother ben when she was going
[1:57:50] through there they were saying what are
[1:57:51] you doing
[1:57:52] she was saying if i just get to his feet
[1:57:56] they were saying what are you gonna do
[1:57:57] she said i'm gonna wash his feet
[1:57:59] i'm gonna dry his feet they said woman
[1:58:01] you ain't got no towel
[1:58:03] do you realize she didn't even take
[1:58:05] fault
[1:58:08] she didn't even take fault when she was
[1:58:11] elbowing her way through
[1:58:12] she just knew brother david if i get
[1:58:15] there
[1:58:16] the water will be there
[1:58:21] if i get there and then the towel will
[1:58:24] be there
[1:58:25] if i get there the answer will be there
[1:58:27] if i get there forgiveness will be there
[1:58:30] and she elbowed her way to the crowd and
[1:58:32] she finally made it to his feet
[1:58:34] and she fell down on her feet on her
[1:58:36] face at his feet
[1:58:38] and she began to wash his feet with her
[1:58:40] tears and she began to dry his feet
[1:58:44] with the hairs of her head and the
[1:58:46] prophet said god
[1:58:48] furnished the water and towels to wash
[1:58:51] his feet
[1:58:52] because she had heard of the living god
[1:58:56] and all of her life but now she's seen
[1:58:59] him
[1:59:00] with her own eyes
[1:59:06] she knew him and inspiration struck her
[1:59:09] and said this is the messenger he needed
[1:59:13] a service
[1:59:14] she had nothing to serve him by his feet
[1:59:16] was dirty
[1:59:18] but she rushed forward anyhow to do him
[1:59:21] a service
[1:59:22] because she was inspired
[1:59:30] she was inspired
[1:59:34] to do it
[1:59:38] but the david there was a channel
[1:59:41] of inspiration
[1:59:45] now you know what amazes me and i'm i'm
[1:59:47] i'm fixing to land this thing okay
[1:59:51] you know what amazes me
[1:59:54] it includes water
[1:59:59] and she had
[2:00:02] no water
[2:00:06] but here's the reality of it
[2:00:09] she was packing
[2:00:13] she was packing the water
[2:00:20] i feel like running through a troop and
[2:00:21] leaping over a wall right there
[2:00:25] she was carrying the water
[2:00:29] the only thing it needed to do was get
[2:00:31] in the presence of something that could
[2:00:33] release it
[2:00:38] y'all hear me tonight i'm preaching to
[2:00:39] you right now
[2:00:41] she just needed to get in the presence
[2:00:45] of something that had more power than
[2:00:46] she did
[2:00:48] to release that water
[2:00:53] you realize in the old testament the one
[2:00:55] the war taxes the enemy would come in
[2:00:56] and do was stop up the water channels
[2:01:00] the bible actually tells us the enemy
[2:01:02] would come in and cut off the water
[2:01:03] supply because the enemy knew
[2:01:05] if we cut off the water
[2:01:08] they'll die the bible says in genesis 26
[2:01:12] and i'm not going to take time to read
[2:01:13] it but you can read when you get home
[2:01:15] that isaac isaac departed fence and he
[2:01:17] dig the wells of water and then the
[2:01:18] servants dig to the valley and they
[2:01:20] found the well
[2:01:20] well springing and then the herdsmen of
[2:01:22] gareer strovin the water is ours and
[2:01:24] they called the name will
[2:01:25] of the whale esik and they because they
[2:01:27] struggle with him then they dig another
[2:01:28] well and stroke for that also and he
[2:01:30] called the name of it sitna
[2:01:31] and he says in verse 22 and he removed
[2:01:33] from fence and digged another whale
[2:01:35] and for that they strove not and he
[2:01:38] called the name of it
[2:01:40] rehoboth and he said are you ready for
[2:01:43] this
[2:01:45] for now the lord
[2:01:48] hath made room for us
[2:01:56] and we shall be fruitful in the land
[2:02:01] bubram says in the pa and i'm closing
[2:02:03] here in the public utility he said if
[2:02:04] you don't pay the bill they'll cut the
[2:02:05] water off
[2:02:06] he said you'll drop around the house and
[2:02:09] that's what's the matter with god's
[2:02:10] people tonight
[2:02:12] he said they just didn't pay the price
[2:02:14] and god
[2:02:16] cut their water off go to any desert you
[2:02:20] want to some full gospel church remember
[2:02:21] so forth don't believe in divine healing
[2:02:23] the reason is your water has been cut
[2:02:26] off
[2:02:27] where there's no water it gets stickers
[2:02:29] where there's no water to soften the
[2:02:31] leaves it becomes stickers
[2:02:32] so they found out that it was with
[2:02:33] without water and he says and when
[2:02:35] you're without water
[2:02:37] you are without life
[2:02:42] when you are without water you are
[2:02:46] without life now think about this
[2:02:53] in these meetings somebody say we must
[2:02:58] we must allow the holy spirit
[2:03:02] to unclog every
[2:03:06] channel satan loves to clog the channel
[2:03:10] of our purpose with our failures
[2:03:13] well i can't do that and i can't serve
[2:03:15] god because i failed him
[2:03:16] satan loves to accumulate all your
[2:03:18] failures
[2:03:20] in the channel that god is wanting to
[2:03:22] pour inspiration into your purpose
[2:03:26] but according to ephesians 3 let me let
[2:03:28] me just get down here and i'll close
[2:03:32] according to ephesians 3 the purpose of
[2:03:35] god is
[2:03:35] eternal then tonight friends
[2:03:39] the holy ghost is looking for someone
[2:03:42] who is willing to let loose
[2:03:44] in these meetings in this service
[2:03:47] and let the holy spirit take control of
[2:03:50] your being
[2:03:53] because the holy ghost is here tonight
[2:03:56] you believe he's here tonight you know
[2:03:58] what he's here to do
[2:04:00] he's here to open up the spiritual
[2:04:01] arteries
[2:04:03] of this church of your life
[2:04:08] in your church in your home
[2:04:12] the bible says ye shall receive power
[2:04:14] after
[2:04:15] the holy ghost has come upon you and ye
[2:04:17] shall be witnesses of me both in
[2:04:18] jerusalem and in all judea and samaria
[2:04:20] and the uttermost parts of the earth and
[2:04:23] the problem of god says like this
[2:04:24] he says he says see he gave the
[2:04:26] commission the disciples
[2:04:28] 120 they should wait in the city of
[2:04:29] jerusalem he said there was a certain
[2:04:31] specification that they must meet before
[2:04:33] they could be qualified as a witness
[2:04:35] and he said this qualification was to be
[2:04:37] the coming of the promised holy spirit
[2:04:39] somebody say to fill the church with
[2:04:42] action and the word unction comes from
[2:04:45] the greek word dynamite
[2:04:46] where it means an explosion
[2:04:54] i'm just going to give you a warning
[2:04:56] god's sending some dynamite into these
[2:04:58] meetings
[2:05:02] not because i'm here or any other
[2:05:04] preacher would be here
[2:05:06] this message the message of the hour
[2:05:10] is the dynamite that will unclog
[2:05:14] every channel
[2:05:17] you remember in the book of kings and
[2:05:19] i'm i'm down here in the book of kings
[2:05:22] they've gone out there and they all got
[2:05:23] dried up remember that
[2:05:26] they didn't have a vision they went off
[2:05:28] without a vision
[2:05:29] i was actually listening to this tape
[2:05:31] today let me let me just read this to
[2:05:32] you the prophet god said see he said now
[2:05:34] they said i saw a vision i see the way
[2:05:36] out
[2:05:36] prophet told him said i know what to do.
[2:05:38] and he said i tell you today the church
[2:05:40] hasn't got the vision
[2:05:41] or they'd have more prayer and they'd be
[2:05:43] more spiritual than what they are
[2:05:45] he said unless there is a vision unless
[2:05:47] someone can see the vision see the
[2:05:49] coming of the lord
[2:05:50] seeing the things that we're going
[2:05:52] through with see all these things that
[2:05:54] god predicted that would be in the last
[2:05:55] days and here we are living in them
[2:05:57] now listen to this instead of reading
[2:05:59] the bible
[2:06:00] he says we're reading love stories
[2:06:02] instead of reading that we read
[2:06:04] everything else
[2:06:05] we ought to be reading god's bible and
[2:06:07] on our knees constantly praying for god
[2:06:09] to help us
[2:06:10] awakening in our
[2:06:14] an awakening in our soul
[2:06:19] a crying out to the lord
[2:06:23] when they seen this song when they when
[2:06:24] they seen when he said he's seen how
[2:06:26] they
[2:06:27] the way out now the first thing i want
[2:06:29] you to do
[2:06:30] is make this valley full of ditches
[2:06:36] probably god said i say that tonight
[2:06:38] that's what we got to do
[2:06:40] is make the way for the holy ghost
[2:06:43] to pour down
[2:06:47] well brother brother brother branham i i
[2:06:49] don't do nothing
[2:06:50] he said now see here's the thing make it
[2:06:53] in your house make it in your church
[2:06:54] make it in yourself
[2:06:56] kick everything out of the way and get
[2:06:57] ready
[2:06:59] are you ready for this there's coming a
[2:07:01] gusher
[2:07:05] there's coming to gusher if you'll get
[2:07:06] ready for it but if you don't make
[2:07:08] ready for it you'll never see it
[2:07:12] he said brother brown i don't do nothing
[2:07:14] maybe that's what's the matter that's
[2:07:15] the trouble of it it's more of a sin to
[2:07:16] do
[2:07:17] not to do than it is to do when you know
[2:07:18] better see he know what to do good do it
[2:07:20] not to him it's a sin
[2:07:22] he said remember remember you
[2:07:23] southerners remember grant was sitting
[2:07:24] on the cross the river and he had a boy
[2:07:26] out there on guard duty and the rebels
[2:07:27] was across the river
[2:07:28] and this boy was walking along there
[2:07:30] kind of dazed around with the dreams of
[2:07:31] his sweetheart
[2:07:32] he left his poster dude and went down to
[2:07:34] pick some violence to send to his
[2:07:35] sweetheart
[2:07:36] he didn't mean to do wrong then at that
[2:07:38] time he was a spy ready of the southern
[2:07:39] army
[2:07:40] and they slipped in and they looked
[2:07:41] around they found out the southern army
[2:07:43] was two or three times the size of
[2:07:44] general grant
[2:07:45] well what happened they come back on the
[2:07:47] post of duty not knowing what had
[2:07:48] happened
[2:07:49] he said the spy had already been there
[2:07:50] and what happened they stormed across
[2:07:52] the river drove them come back in the
[2:07:53] state
[2:07:54] and the boy was shot an hour later they
[2:07:56] didn't have not
[2:07:57] no objection to him picking the violence
[2:07:58] they didn't it wasn't what he had done
[2:08:01] it was the things he didn't do he didn't
[2:08:03] stand at his post of duty
[2:08:05] he didn't guard the post like he was
[2:08:07] supposed to
[2:08:09] and he spoiled the whole thing
[2:08:15] the prophet god said notice when they
[2:08:17] begin to dig they dug right against the
[2:08:19] thing that says the musicians are coming
[2:08:21] they begin to dig right against the
[2:08:22] things just voted out made big ditches
[2:08:25] the next morning the enemy looked down
[2:08:26] and the sun came up and it looked like
[2:08:27] blood they said well they've fallen on
[2:08:29] one another killed each other
[2:08:30] and the way they went and they were
[2:08:32] ambushed and they said this is just the
[2:08:34] light thing before the lord sending
[2:08:35] forth his water
[2:08:37] and they went over the other land and
[2:08:38] they stomped up every whale

[2:08:42] real
[2:08:43] old-fashioned revival

[2:08:50] were asking god because they finally
[2:08:52] went consulted the prophet

[2:13:04] our lives and our homes
[2:13:08] and our churches our churches would be
[2:13:11] dry
[2:13:14] our young people would be dried up
[2:13:17] the ministry would be dried up
[2:13:20] but god who is rich in mercy
[2:13:24] has allowed us another opportunity
[2:13:29] to keep the heart to open our heart
[2:13:33] to clean out all the accumulated matter
[2:13:35] in our heart
[2:13:36] that don't belong there
[2:13:40] but there being one here tonight would
[2:13:42] say lord on this first night
[2:13:44] help me to help me to dig out all the
[2:13:47] channels of my heart
[2:13:51] maybe you're a young person here
[2:13:54] maybe maybe things have been passed down
[2:13:56] to you generation the generation
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:00] maybe you're carrying things that that
[2:14:02] you weren't even born to even live
[2:14:04] through or experience
[2:14:08] but today and right now
[2:14:11] it can stop
[2:14:16] maybe something has been passed down to
[2:14:17] you that
[2:14:19] maybe maybe it's at all in your heart to
[2:14:21] get somebody
[2:14:22] and you don't even know the person but
[2:14:25] because
[2:14:26] of something that was said is passed
[2:14:29] down to you because of a generation
[2:14:30] before you zone
[2:14:32] would you say tonight lord let it stop
[2:14:35] with me
[2:14:38] what brother andrew you're saying i've
[2:14:39] got to agree with the wrong i'm not
[2:14:40] saying that at all
[2:14:43] i'm saying you've got to stay open
[2:14:46] your channels can't get caught up
[2:14:49] you've got to stay in a place where the
[2:14:51] inspiration of god can flow through your
[2:14:53] life
[2:14:54] can flow through your heart he's here
[2:14:57] tonight
[2:14:59] he's here in the power of his word
[2:15:02] heavenly father
[2:15:03] lord all across this field and tonight

[2:15:18] before you tonight
[2:15:20] maybe they've been sitting in church and
[2:15:23] they've been hearing the inspired word
[2:15:26] but lord it methods inspired
[2:15:29] methods movement and methods caused them
[2:15:30] to rise up and
[2:15:32] claim the promises of god but lord i
[2:15:35] believe tonight that
[2:15:37] if that would be the case i believe
[2:15:38] you've said a word in this evening time
[2:15:41] that's answered the question it's
[2:15:43] because we've allowed the channels
[2:15:45] to become climbed up we've allowed the
[2:15:49] channels
[2:15:50] the faith and the channels of fellowship
[2:15:53] lord the channels of
[2:15:55] of shouting and rejoicing and preaching
[2:15:57] the message of the hour
[2:15:59] though there's preachers in this message
[2:16:02] that have allowed hurts and
[2:16:04] bitterness and things to accumulate in
[2:16:06] their channels lord
[2:16:08] lord to where they're trying to pass
[2:16:10] down those hurts to other generations
[2:16:13] lord they're trying to pass down the
[2:16:14] people that offended them and
[2:16:16] get people offended at the person
[2:16:18] defended them lord so much nonsense
[2:16:20] going on
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:22] but lord you've sent a message of
[2:16:24] dynamite
[2:16:25] to blow out every channel to where we
[2:16:28] don't have to leave this building
[2:16:29] tonight
[2:16:30] with one ill feeling in our heart with
[2:16:34] one all against one another
[2:16:36] in our heart lord we don't have to come
[2:16:38] to these meetings
[2:16:40] wish that we could receive inspiration
[2:16:43] wishing we could receive deliverance
[2:16:45] wish that we could receive the holy
[2:16:46] ghost father
[2:16:48] this house is a house of god it's a
[2:16:51] house of faith
[2:16:52] it's a place where impossibilities
[2:16:55] become possibilities
[2:16:57] it's a place where demons fall powerless
[2:16:59] before the church
[2:17:01] i'm praying tonight god you would go
