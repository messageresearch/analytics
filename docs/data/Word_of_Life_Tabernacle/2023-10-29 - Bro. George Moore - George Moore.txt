Christian home and and I grew up you know kind of rough and I used to go to parties now I know some of y'all used to go to parties in here somebody used to probably go to parties in here before they served the Lord I never did like to go to a party and be a Wallflower though Saints I I like to go to a party where they were getting down come on and I'll tell you I I'm also a kind of a sports fan and I I don't like to just go to the a game and just set on the bleachers I I like to get in the spirit of it you know and I'll tell you my God today is worth a lot more than any party I used to go to and he's worth a lot more than in his football game and he's worth a lot more than any other things of the world I don't see no reason why we should be a Wallflower in church amen and if I go to church I want to go to a church where they're getting down all right I came to praise the Lord today amen it's it's it's it this it my hobby or my pastime this is who I am Saints this is what I do amen I I like to come to the house of the Lord now now when I was in the world I used to like to do the things of the world but now I still do everything I want to do but God changed everything that I want to do now this is what I want to do Saints amen and so I'm so happy to be here with you this morning and and maybe before we're all seated we'll go ahead and just read the scripture uh uh Genesis the 14th chapter so we can get into the word today and Saints I'll tell you I just so appreciate being here I uh most of all I appreciate this beautiful Arkansas weather we've had and and and um but I always appreciate the fine atmosphere in this church and I I appreciate you the cream of the crop and I'm so happy to be here assembled with you this morning and I just want to extend my thanks to all the the fine cooking and all the work that went into the Fall Fest yesterday it was wonderful I I eat too much and y'all make it hard to stay fitting in the same suit when you leave here and so I certainly appreciated that and that gum if y'all didn't get none of that gumbo yesterday that was world class gumbo I had a couple bows of that I told Ben last night I said I feel cheated I eat so much gumbo I don't feel like I got the proper amount of dessert that I should have got but it's a pleasure to be here with you Genesis the 14th chapter I so appreciate the church I appreciate your fine Pastor you got a man of God here and I certainly thank the Lord for him Genesis 14 and8 and there went out the king of Sodom and the king of gomorah and the king of adma and the king of Zabo and the king of Bea which the same is zor and they joined battle with them in the valley of sidom veil of sidom uh with cheder lomer the king of Elum and tidal the king of Nations and amrel king of Sinar and arak the king of elsar Four Kings with five and the vow of sidom was full of slime pits and the kings of Sodom and gomorra fled and fell there and they remain fled to the mountain and they took all the goods of Sodom and gomor and all their victuals and went on and went their way and they took lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew that he for he dwelt in the plain of mamry the Amorite brother of escol and the brother of Anor and these were Confederate with Abram and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smoke them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of cheder and of the uh the kings that were with him at the valley of shaven which is the King's Dale and MDC king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the high priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath dwelt or which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him ties of all wonderful amen let's turn over just for one little Short scripture in Galatians the 3D chapter and then you can have your seats Galatians the 3 chapter and the 26th verse Galatians 3:26 say Amen when you got it some of you didn't say Amen am for ye are all everybody say all all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many as you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all everybody say all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then you are Abraham seed and HS according to the promise and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated maybe we could just bow our heads this morning for a word of prayer heavenly father I just thank you so much for this church Lord I Thank you for these brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith Lord we thank you Father that that oh God that there's just something about each Lord that you've called us Lord oh yes and Lord You've appointed This Time Lord that we don't believe anybody is here by accident Lord but we believe it's a predestinated Time father that Lord before the foundation of the world you saw us you knew the day we'd be living in you knew the hour we'd be living in you knew the conditions of our life and you knew that you would have us all here this morning to worship you and Lord we just ask oh God that you would bless each one in the divine presence this morning I ask you oh God your words is already blessed Lord but we just pray you would bless our hearts to receive it father and our ears to hear it and Lord God that you would watch over this service I pray you'd bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you all and I want to take a text this morning or a title of everything in the land belongs to you everything in the land belongs to you now I'm going to read you this quote here before we get going brother brandham said in the way of a true prophet of God he said when as I said Abraham he was in the promised land God gave it to him lot was taken by some Renegade Outlaws took away that was his nephew all right and everything was in that land belonged to Abraham so he wasn't a warrior he never did fight he didn't have any warriors with him he had some servants but when he seen that something the devil had come and robbed him of something that was promised to him he armed his servants and he took an arm himself and he didn't know how he was going to overcome this whole company of Kings just a handful of servants but God told him how to do it and he divided himself and slaughtered the Kings and came back triumphant why he laid his faith upon God's promise that everything that was in the land belonged to him right everything that was in the land was his and lot was a part of it that's right that was a part of the land oh my and here he met mezic after the battle was over could you just see Abraham coming up the road he didn't know he was a warrior but he knew he was then and yes sir and he met the one who gave the promise MDC so Saints we find here that the prophet of God said that Abraham was minding his own business on the plains of mamry he was minding his own business to sending to his sheep and then the enemy came in and he took lot out of Sodom and that's where he messed up right there because lot was a part of Abraham and everything that was in that land belonged to Abraham can you say Amen this morning and so those kings came in and they took lot away captive now I'll tell you Saints looking at it from a carnal standpoint lot probably deserved everything that he was getting right he probably deserved it all because look he'd been down there in Sodom he went down took the easy way and he' been held captive down there and we find that he was in a bad situation now what brother brandham goes on he says in the world God's word calls for a total separation for unbelief he said all these Believers we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of change out of your pocket in God's hands he says you pull out a bunch of change and there's pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters and half dollars and dollars all in coins he said now that's what the world is in in God's hand and there's some people that can just have a Penny's worth of it and God can only use them in a penny way now listen to what the prophet says he said that's all they can buy don't reject them brother Bram said there some of them is pennies don't reject them God can only use them in a penny way and he said if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because God uses pennies sometimes and lot was just a penny and Abraham was a silver dollar so it took a hundred lots to make an Abraham and so will it take a hundred carnal Believers listen to this chains 100 carnal Believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in Christ Jesus were on the word where the word can flow through them All Saints it's got to be our goal this morning it's not our goal to be a lot today it's not our goal to be a carnal believer today it's got to be our goal to be an Abraham and to be separated from the carnal things of the world so that the word of God can flow through US Saints and in order for the word to flow through us we got to be separated from the carnal things of the world now that's got to be our prayer Saints Lord Jesus separate me from the carnal things of this world Amen now see carnal don't always mean sinful caral can be just worldly ISM Saints and I'll tell you it's it I'm I'm not just standing for me today I'm standing for my family and I'm standing for my church and I'm standing for my brothers and sisters and I'm standing for this message I'm standing today Saints I'm standing I'm standing standing for my children I'm standing for my loved ones I'm standing not just for myself amen so I've got to be separated from the carnal things of the world so that the word of God can flow through me Saints is that your desire today Saints amen now brother brandham says this he says in in in the in the token message he talks about the ceiling of the train car and he said the train car is isn't sealed until all that's inside it is right amen and I'll tell you there's a lot of people that look right on the outside but there ain't no ceiling until the inside's right see I might look good to you but on the inside I could be another way amen a lot of people project one way on the outside but on the inside God knows what's on the inside and there's no ceiling until the inside is put away rights and he said full obedience to the word of God will entitle you to the Token will entitle you to the Token put your name in there will entitle you to the token and he said not part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ oh God full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ he said now what if it was just all of you in but your feet hanging out what if it was all of you with your hands hanging out most of you in but your heart hanging out see heart's in the world yet but we don't do that full complete obedience puts you and the word one all right you believe it every bit of it all of it's in you and you watch it working through you yeah Saints I I want to be separated from the things of the world because I want the world to the to to be gone for me because the word can flow through me because I am standing for people yes I got family that needs to be saved I got children that I want to see prosper in this message I got grandchildren coming up and I'm not just standing for myself I want the word to flow through me I got to token to apply to some family in my life yes sir real Christianity is living for others is that what he said I got to say Lord separate me from the things of this world Saints this ain't no time to let the world creep into our home it ain't no time to let the world creep into our churches or let the world creep into our lives Saints it's a time to separates it ain't no time to have one foot in the world and another foot in the church it's a Time to separate choose this day who you will serve oh it's hard preaching this morning Sint but Saints listen we got no time now I'm not talking about separating from Brotherhood we got we got too much of that right on I'm not talking about separating from fellowship we don't need none of that right I'm talking about separation from the things of the world Amen and it feels like sometimes that we are losing this back battle against worldism in this message now now I I now look I believe in com as you are but I don't believe in staying as you are I believe everybody is welcome to the house of the Lord I mean I don't believe any child is born knowing how to walk you got to learn how to walk amen you're not born knowing amen and you can't punish a child for falling down when he's trying to learn to walk amen but if he is 20 years old and they still don't know how to walk something's wrong is that right Saints amen so so I don't believe in and staying like you are I believe we all should be getting better I believe every church every service I should draw a little closer to God I believe I should be a better man tomorrow than I am today I believe I should be a better Christian tomorrow than I am do you believe that today Saints I want to be getting better I don't want to stay the same I don't want to backslide I want to get better amen and it's no time to be joined with the things of the world but it seems like we've let off of crying out against it anymore but the message cries out against it the message doesn't tolerate it so neither should we Saints amen we should stand for something this message is a standard sir amen but it seems like in the message the clothes keep getting Tighter and the dress keeps getting more immodest and the paint keeps getting thicker and it seems like the men not just in the message but in the world today especially in America keep getting more and more feminine now there's an image that the world has of what a man should be right and that's a jellyfish but that's not the image that God's word has that a man should be see a man should stand for something Saints a man should stand for his family A man should be able to do the right thing whether he wants to do it or not amen a man should be able to handle a tough decision and not put it off on his wife to make it amen on now that I'm just telling you this ain't popular but the world they don't want to hear this but we're not in the world Saints and men should be men brother BR said give me a backbone like a solo amen but men today have gotten soft to the point they can't control their own flesh with their own desires and just anything goes Saints and they want to cow down and and stay at home and send their wife to work oh God but Saints men should be men yes sir amen and I I don't care what the world thinks I should be I want to be what God thinks I should be amen I'll tell you sa sister Brandy SI Sister Moore don't want me to sit around talking to her about my feelings all the time come on she don't want to hear all that she wants me to deal with it and provide amen that's come on oh my come on but the message cries out against these things of the world so we should cry out against them too amen Saints I'll tell you it ain't no time in this day and time to let a ball game or a TV program or some worldly entertainment keep aside of the house of the Lord when a ball game gets to be more important and comeing of the house of the Lord there's a problem somewhere Saints amen when a program you're too tired to come on Wednesday but you're not too tired to watch something on the TV God's word calls for separation from those things amen now unconditional Covenant brother Brown said God wants separators separate yourself that's right God always calls for separation separate from your Associates separate from your habits separate from from everything and come out and stand alone for God Amen that's where the first man was called by election that's where the last man's been called to do the same thing separate yourself from your Associates the things of the world come out from among them and be ye separate now how many of you in here say I want a blessing he said he said be be ye separate he said then I'll bless you if you want a blessing separate yourself from the things of the world now that's a direct quote yes sir amen now he said he said these things and we find people many times that that we we look at it and think well maybe there's a problem in the message Saints there's no problem with the message the message is right the message is God's word amen the message isn't the problem what we we don't have a message problem we got a we got a perfect message we don't have a message problem what we got is a the Holy Ghost problem yeah right see somewhere along the line somebody got the idea that you just believe the message and you got it well believing the message ain't the Holy Ghost Saints see I believe the message before I got the Holy Ghost amen but sometime you find people that'll be seeking the Holy Ghost and somebody's talking to them saying well well don't you believe the message now that's not the Holy Ghost now brother Bram said this at Valley full of ditches he said that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal church tonight now you say well I'm not Pentecostal s I'll tell you you better be Pentecostal amen now I'm not talking about Pentecostal by denomination I'm talking about Pentecostal like I got an experience like I was there when something changed in my life like I was there when God filled me not Pentecostal by denomination Pentecostal by experience and he said that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal Church they got out on the wrong ground just like lot did and he said that's a reason the church tonight people used to think it's wrong to do certain things now it's not wrong and they do it anyhow is that right Saints he says you got out on the wrong grounds you got on with the wrong crowd he said show me your company and I tell you who you are let me walk in your house and let me see what's laying open on the table let me see how that how that Bible's marked up now Saints you you can't just take your Bible and Mark it up to be religious you you got to read it amen you can mark the Bible up that doesn't change anything but if you read what's in it he said it tell you who you are and he said let me see where it's these old true stories uh let me listen to what kind of music you're bringing on the radio let me see what kind of pictures you got in your house let me add let me see what kind of pictures you got on your phone and I'll tell you what you made out of yes sir that's your what your soul is feeding on regardless of what your testimony is your fruits prove what you are he said oh it's a truth your soul is feeding on something and whatever characteristic of your soul is it'll show forth that's the reason Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them that's right he said you took a lot of advantage of saying I spoke in tongues I got the Holy Ghost if your life doesn't type up with it you didn't do it you either got the devil or the flesh amen and we see people in churches sometimes and and and we we notice that you know it doesn't seem like they ever sell out all the way it doesn't seem like they ever fully surrender it seems like they always got maybe a foot out in the world or or maybe they got some worldly entertainments or something or some kind of worldly things in their life and and maybe they maybe they come to church but it doesn't seem like they're as consecrated as they need to be and those type things and so we see those things and you wonder sometimes what do these people really see but Saints I'm not interested today in trying to classify what type type of believer everybody is that's not my job that's not your job I'm not really interested in putting everybody in one group or the other and I'm not really interested in looking around and saying pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollar Sil oh that brother there he's about 4 cents that brother over there he's about 27 that's not my job Saints because I've been wrong too many times I've seen people that would go long a certain way for years and then something set fire to their soul and they changed and they live differently I've seen it happen sometimes 15 20 years of coasting along but then God come on the scene one day maybe in a service like this right here God come on the scene and change their life right I've been wrong too many times I've seen people and I said they're a real believer and they ain't around no more yeah right and I've seen people said they ain't going to make it and they doing good today because God come on the scene sir it's not my job to classify everybody I'm not sitting around trying to figure out who's foolish virgin and who's wise virgin and and who's make believer and who's unbeliever that's God's job I'm here to preach the gospel today can you say Amen today Saints amen I don't know how anybody is going to end up so I'm not giving up on nobody I can't give up on nobody that's in God's hands I Won't Give Up on nobody it ain't how you start Saints it's how you finish all right some of us might not start out very good but we can finish this race Saint amen good you never know when something's going to click with somebody that's right you never know what hour God's going to come on the scene for somebody so we don't give up see lot was a carnal believer brother brand said but he was still a Believer right he wasn't an unbeliever he wasn't a make believer he was still a Believer now that's second Peter 2:7 if you want to read that the Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily is that right yeah he wasn't an unbeliever but he was hanging around with the wrong crowd Saints and I don't care who you are today if you hang around with the wrong crowd it will have an effect on you it it you can't stay around the world and not get worldly that's right that's good on the flip side you can't hang around Holy Ghost believers and not live closer to God that's why we assemble oursel together I got to come get some of it Saints I got to come get around some Believers you might leave this church and never come across another believer until you come back to this church so it's critical that we assemble oursel together we oh it's critical Saints yeah we got to have each other today amen amen I got to be around you so I can be better come on somebody you got to have that brother or sister sitting next to you you got to have them saints amen I tell you I can't sit at home and be a goodest Christian as I ever was come on I got to come to the house of the Lord amen good or bad whoever you're around will have an effect on you right amen and lot had went off into Sodom and he had taken the easy way out and he'd went off into Sodom and he backslid and his children were engaged to sodomites and his wife was engaged in all the social activities of Sodom brother Bram said lot had wife trouble on said this where it gets quiet ain't it Saints there's no decision that you'll ever make outside of serving the lord Jesus Christ that'll have more of an impact on the quality of your life than who you're going to spend it with young people that's a decision that's got to be done under prayer and searching and seeking because it's the number one determining outcome of how your life is is who you spend it with right now brother Brown said the sins of Sodom Vex lot's soul only his wife wouldn't permit him to do anything about it and I'll tell you Saints if you got a good wife or you got a good husband you're blessed today you're blessed today cuz it's hard to be five cents worth of husband married to 50 cents worth of wife it's a hard life for that wife it's hard to be a dollar's worth of husband and have a dime's worth it's hard for that husband it's hard to be unequally yolked amen it's the most important decision so lot had gotten himself into quite a predicament he was in quite a situation but it didn't matter because he was a part of Abraham and everything that was in that land belonged to Abraham and and and you might have some family today that's gotten themselves into a similar situation maybe they're in a bad situation maybe they're not doing very well today but it doesn't matter because they're a part of you and everything that was in that land belongs to you today the Bible said you're the Seed of Abraham and you HS with him according to the promise come on somebody everything is in this land right here belongs to you now the prodical son is a great example and and you know you all know the story in I'm GNA say Luke 15 but the man had two sons and one of the sons came to him and he wanted his inheritance and then he took his inheritance and he spent it all on riotous living the Bible said and the Bible said that he got in a then a a drought came through the land one like not like what we got going on here in Hardy but a drought came through the land and and said that he he got in a bad situation he spent all of his money and there was a drought in the land and he found himself so low that he had to take a job in a foreign land feeding the Hogs yeah is that what the Bible said Saints and the Bible said he got in such a backsliding low condition that he was living off a corn husks now I don't know much about farming Saints but I know that the corn husk is the part of the tamale that you throw away come on I don't know about farming but I know a lot about tamales and I know you don't eat the corn husk and this man was in such a situation till he found himself living on corn husk in the manure pile now you say well brother George he he probably deserved it yeah he probably did but when you look into the message you find that we all deserved it right come on now now brother Brown said he said all of us deserve death because we were rebellions against God but notice we all deserve dying but God is so merciful he shouldn't never have thought of us he's so merciful till he took the sins of every one of us and struck it on his only begotten son Christ that we might not perish but have eternal life right good amen you say well brother George I've been in the message my whole life that's good but you still had to have your sin taken away you say brother George I look at all these good works I do that's good but you still had to have your sin taken away you say brother George look at all the tapes I listen to every day that's good but you still had to have your sin taken away yes sir brother George look at all I do for the church that's good but you still had to have your sin taken away brother George I've been my family's been in the message three generations that's good but you still had to have your sin away amen amen so nobody can look at anybody and think they're better than somebody cuz we all had to come the same way amen you might have a little more Revelation in the next brother you might know a little bit more but you ain't no better we all had to come the same way through the same blood and the same Lord Jesus had to get me as had to get you you has had to get your children oh God good we still had to have our sin taken away see Saints we got to learn to have a little Grace for people we just never know what people go through you don't know what's going on Saints I've had a couple of calls over the past couple weeks that shocked me people that look like everything was going going good that looked like everything was was doing fine that on the outside looked like they had it all together and they're going through great trial that could be anybody in here today yeah you might look like you got it all together don't mean you do you might look like everything's going great don't mean it is you never know what people go through you never know what happened before they walked in that door back there you never know what school's like or what work's like or what home life is like like or what the marriage is like you never know Saints what people deal with and we got to have some Grace amen sometimes it seems like we scan the room looking to find something wrong with somebody you see people walk into the church and the eyes start to roll nobody that's trying to get their life together needs to have eyes rolled at them come on at least they're at church it could be anywhere at least they made it to church last thing they need some ey rolls come on somebody that's the last thing we need already taking a bad Road already down they coming here to get better amen and we got to learn to have a little Grace it's an evil deceitful age it's an age where the devil has traps on every corner it's an age where the devil sets traps for every one of us and it's hard Saints it's a deceptive age and outside of the Holy Ghost you can't live above it right and people get caught in traps and people make mistakes I'm one of them we all do and we got to have a little Grace now the Bible said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy so if we want Mercy for ourselves we got to learn how to have mercy on others amen good yes sir got to have a little Mercy Galatians 61 says Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual that's us supposedly on if a man be overtaken in Fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness now don't say go tell everybody in church about it on but it says considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so the spiritual can be tempted also is that what the Bible says says every one of us can be tempted every one of us can go through a Temptation none of us can get above that Amen on and I'll tell you Saints sometimes if you get too religious your temptation is coming amen if we ever get to thinking that we're above somebody else that we're better than somebody else the fall is coming blessed is the meek for they shall inherit the earth amen and brother Brown said in a message of Grace he said according to prophecy there will come a headstone and I want you to notice that when The Headstone comes the prince that that's going to cry out will cry the message of Grace Grace for it's by Grace We're saved not by works lest any man should boast and the message of Grace has been Trampled Under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace see we don't believe in anything goes we believe in hold the standards but we believe there's Grace when people make mistakes oh God and he said some of them runs out onto eternal security and some of them runs out into everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same and that's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by amen amen Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this morning it's a message of Grace that we're all saved by than amen now we find this example of this prodical son that one day he was sitting in the manure Pile in the pig pin living off a corn husk and the Bible said that he came to his oh God Saints you got to remember the day you came to yourself you got to remember you got to remember remember the time where everything changed for you Saints don't ever lose sight of the day God come on the scene for you and if he did it for you he can do it for your brother if he did it for you he can do it for your children if he did it for you he can do it for your church thank you Lord he came to himself the Bible said and he said you know what my father has got slaves that's living better than I'm living right here God it's better be a doormat in the house of God than to dwell in the tents with the wicked yeah he said my father has got slaves that's living better than me and I'd like to go back to my father and I could just I don't want to be a son I don't deserve to be a son but if I could just be a servant in his house that'd be good enough for me at least they got something to eat sir amen amen and so he goes to his father's house I love the Bible says said that when he was yet a way off sir that his father saw him GL and ran to him and had compassion on him and he said I've sinned against you I've sinned against God and his father said bring the bring the best robe bring the ring bring some shoes and put on his feet bring the fatty calf all right thank you Lord Jesus yes he said my son who was lost is found he was dead and now he's alive again than Lord and He welcomed him back with open arms Saints amen he didn't say one word to him about all the wrong he' done he didn't tell him how he messed up he didn't tell him all the mistakes he made he already knew the mistakes he made he just restored him to his rightful place as a son oh God good aren't you glad you've been restored Saints oh God and I'll tell you back to lot he might have been a mess and he might have been in a mess but that was Abraham's mess GL and your family they might be in a mess today I don't know I pray they're not but but they might be but they're your mess your children might get in a mess I pray they don't but they might and if they do they're still your mess they belong to you this church your family your children everyone Anything could happen but it doesn't matter cuz they belong to you and everything that's in this land belongs to you sir and you know they might have deserved everything they got coming to them yeah most of the time we do most of the time we deal with the things we deal with because decisions that we made but it doesn't matter because everything that's in the land belongs to you amen and I'll tell you Saints this message is my family oh thank you Lord I don't have many family left natural speaking but he said if he said I'll give you fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters I'll give them to you if you serve me and he's done that for me and this message Saints is my family I got people in this message that I'm closer to than I've ever been closer to some of my family this message is my family and I know we got some problems and I know there's some disagreements and I know there's some different doctrines and I know but it's still my family it still belongs to me and everything that's in this land belongs to me and I might be fighting with somebody in the backyard but if we ever get around to the front yard I got you back I don't agree with everything I see I don't agree with everything every Church does but it's still my family and if they need my help I'm going to be there man I don't want to just worry about one church I'm worried about people we're in this to help people that's got to be our heart to help people amen now brother Bram said there was 10 of them Brams and he said they might fight like cats and dogs in the backyard but if they went around to the front yard and you started messing with one of them he said you got all 10 of them brandom on you that's right and he said that's the way it is with the Church of God Saints there's so much going on in the message there's churches in Tucson that that people are putting up fraudulent websites with their name on it that slander that church and slander those people and slander those pastors and and look I I don't agree with everything some of those churches has done but I don't want to see that that's right oh come on because you know what it might be my church next it might be your church next amen Saints we got to have each other's backs in this amen and I'll tell you Saints Abraham was given the task to go get lot what I like about it so much is that we don't read in the Bible of any time where God came down and spoke to AB Abraham in this instance and told him to go get lot that's right we don't see in the Bible where he ever had a vision or or or God ever met him in a physical body and said go get lot that's right but what he had was the word that promised that everything that was in that land belonged to him right and I'll tell you Sint sometimes we go through trials and we're praying about it we're we're asking about it we're seeking God God on it and we're looking for some kind of sign or wonder or Miracle or something like that to happen when we've already got the original word that tells us what to do all right Amen in the midst of trial Saints we we don't always have to have a supernatural sign we don't always have to dream a dream we don't always have to have an audible voice we can take God's word and go forward now brother Brown said there's no place to retreat in God he said go forward if the doctor says it's cancer go forward he said if he says it's TB go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward he said if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go forward if the church turns you out go forward he said there's no retreating back go forward speak the word and go [Music] forward thank you Lord so when you see these trials come against you Saints you see these test in your family yeah speak the word and go forward Saints amen you know what the word says so you can tell the devil give it back that's my family and I claim them in Jesus name you say devil give me back my health in Jesus name go by his stripes I'm Healed speak the word and go forward he said thank you Lord because everything in this land belongs to you everything in the promised land belongs to you now to us that's the Holy Ghost everything that's in this word belongs to you I'm going to read you this quote Saints it'll change everything restoration of brid tree he says then we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God gives us for God has a law and his law is his word and God in his word made certain claims to the church therefore we have the right to enforce these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it because we take God's agent the Holy Spirit and go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the Lord and he's got to give it up that's all cuz the holy spirit is there to make him do it oh my the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal right by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and force this upon [Music] him oh my so we just believe God's word and go forward we believe what he said and go forward we tell Satan to give it back yes oh come on Amen now Four Kings brought their armies and took Sodom and they' already beat five Kings in their armies and they took lot and where they messed up is when they took lot because everything that was in that land belonged to Abraham and and and brother Brown said Abraham didn't have a bunch of military men he had some servants he said but God told him how to do it he showed him how to do it he said and he said he divided his servants and he and he went and took back everything that the enemy had taken from him yeah now brother Brown said he wasn't a warrior yeah that's right it amen but he knew that everything in the land belonged to him I'll tell you Saints David wasn't a Warrior when he smoked Goliath he was just a kid yeah shamgar wasn't a Warrior when he picked up at Ox gold is that right now I grew up rough and I grew up fighting and I fought all my life and I got kicked out of school every year for fighting with somebody and Mom got tired of picking me up from school all the time that's how I grew up I grew up rough I had a brother and it was rough we were just rough Saints and I've been fighting my whole life and it served me well in the message brother Ben but that might not be your testimony your testimony may be that you was born in the message and you've been raised in the message and you gave your heart to the Lord in the message and you've lived for the Lord every day of your life I pray that is your testimony that's what I want for my children that's what I want for my grandchildren that's what I want that's the greatest testimony there is don't ever let nobody tell you oh if you go out in the world you come back you got a testimony that's foolishness Saints stay right with it it's a greatest testimony I know is to live for the Lord every day of your life that's the best testimony there is that's the best now you might have a testimony where you was in a gang you've been shot four times you did drugs and and and and did all kinds of that's fine too Saints we appreciate that testimony because it just shows that God can save anybody but it doesn't matter what your testimony is don't be ashamed of it right and you might not feel like today you got an earth shattering testimony you might not feel like you got a testimony like some of the others but that don't mean you're not a warrior that don't mean you don't know how to fight you might not grown up fighting like me that don't mean you don't know how to fight I'll tell you the devil don't want to go to battle against a mama fighting for her children the devil don't want to go to battle against a mama that's shielding her children he don't want to go to battle against a housewife that's fighting for her marriage he don't want to go to battle against a child that's praying for a wayward parent the devil don't want none of that the devil don't want to go to battle against a grandparent that's putting a hedge of protection around their grandchildren the devil don't want to go battle against a daddy fighting for his little girls the devil don't want to go to battle against these believer Saints that's fighting for their family it ain't the size of the dog in the fight it's a size of the fight and the dog because every everything is in the land belongs to you now Abraham was forced into battle he didn't go looking for trouble but he wasn't running from it either he was minding his own business in the plains of mamry when the devil came to him but he wasn't backing down once he was presented with a fight I like that verse that says if I must fight then I must Reign if I'm going to have to fight anyways I might as well win Saints if I got to lace my boots up the devil's got to go down somewhere if I got to fight I got to reain if I got to fight I got to win if you got to fight you might as well win Saints now you're going to have to fight every day of your life you might as well win this is for those who overcome it's for Victorious People things amen and I like that little story brother told about brother Bram told about Peter cartright and he said he went into that town and he was going to hold a Revival and when he went back there he said the town bully saw him washing windows and he said what are you doing here he said I came to hold a Revival he said there ain't going to be no Revival in this town he said I got to the Lord told me to is that right Saints the Lord told me to hold this revival he said well you'll have to whip me first he said well I'll just do that next then yes said he got done washing windows he jumped up on top of him and he said if I must fight then I must reain beat the tar out of him he said he got saved that night in the service because everything that was in that town belonged to Peter cartright amen so if you got to get the sword of the spirit out Saints the devil's got to go down somewhere if you got to polish up the shield of Faith there's got to be a pain train coming for the devil somewhere yes amen if you got to clip on the Buckle of Truth The Devils have got to go flying somewhere if the helmet of salvation goes on the gloves got to come off if we going to fight why don't we win right amen and it's time that the bride recognizes who she is it's time that she recognizes now brother Brown said if there wasn't a law to that he said Sons and Daughters of God could create them a world out here and go live a private life on it right number that's a direct quote he said you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got the the power to do it God's omnipotence see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now that's what power is in the church right now he said right not tomorrow not next week not next month not when something else happens yeah right right now he said but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe that is if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe oh whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place that the soul of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean that power is he said that power is controlled by if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time he said but your faith gets away from it oh my can the musicians come oh my just one more quote recognizing your day and its message he said the spirit of God which is the word of God my spirit my word is spirit and life he said the spirit of God will put the bride in her place yes because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no National Force will do it but National Force did Drive Israel into the Homeland watch what's happening now and National forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory oh hallelujah oh God just play Something There Brother s so Abraham took God at his word and he went on the word of God on the strength of the word on the power of the word he went and he took back what the devil had stole from him and you and I today are the Seed of Abraham and and being the Seed of Abraham we're HS with Abraham according to the promise and the same word of God today that Abraham used is the same word of God that you and I have today and the power is within us to take God at his word and to take back everything that the devil stole from us and if he took peace from us we take it back and if he took Joy from us we take it back and if he tried to give us anxiety we cast it away if he tried to give us depression we cast it away and if he's tried to take our family we take them back and if he's trying to work on our children we take them back amen everything that the devil stole from us we take it back by the power of the word of God and if he's made us sick in our body we take it back yeah and if he's messing with our mind we take it back and if he makes us think we're not good enough we take it back by the blood of Jesus Christ we are perfect [Music] today we take it back how many of you say I'm going to take it back today I'm taking back everything that the devil took from me I'm taking back everything that the devil stole from my home I'm taking back everything that the devil's trying to poison my mind with I'm taking it back today I'm a Believer today I was born for this message I was born to serve the Lord God predestinated me to it I was put here for a purpose I was put here to be a thorn in the devil's side I was put here to cause problems for the devil every day of my life I'm going to be problems for the devil every day of my life he ain't going to be able to handle all of this sir oh he's going to get tired of messing with me he's going to get tired of messing with my family cuz I'm claiming them by the word of God yes sir thank you I'll take it all back today let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus oh God we believe this word today Lord it ain't man's word it's your word these Bibles these aren't Bible stories these are Bible truths this word didn't come from a man it came from the son of man and Lord we just
