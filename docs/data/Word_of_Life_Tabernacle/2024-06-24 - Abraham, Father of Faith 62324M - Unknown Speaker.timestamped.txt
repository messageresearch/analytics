[44:45] amen amen God bless you Genesis CH 12
[44:49] and verse 1 Genesis 12 and
[44:53] 1 we continue to speak about
[44:57] Abraham father of
[45:01] Faith Genesis
[45:05] 121 says now the Lord had said unto
[45:08] Abram get thee out of thy country and
[45:11] from thy Kindred Kindred and from thy
[45:13] Father's House unto a l unto a land that
[45:17] I will show
[45:19] Thee I will make of thee a great nation
[45:23] I Will Bless thee and make thy name
[45:24] great and thou shalt be a
[45:28] blessing and and I will bless them that
[45:30] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[45:33] thee and in the shall all families of
[45:36] the earth be blessed so Abram departed
[45:40] as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot
[45:43] went with him and Abram was 75 years old
[45:48] when he departed out of Aaron man I pray
[45:51] the Lord that His blessings to the word
[45:53] you may be seated
[46:02] there are three covenants made in the
[46:04] Old Testament the first is the adamic
[46:07] Covenant the covenant made with Adam
[46:09] which is the
[46:11] Covenant uh that Adam and Eve broke and
[46:15] then there's the noic Covenant which we
[46:17] know uh they didn't keep very long as we
[46:19] heard about this morning how that they
[46:22] immediately descended into idolatry
[46:24] After the flood and then there's the
[46:26] abrahamic Covenant which is the Covenant
[46:29] that God made with Abraham when God made
[46:33] a covenant with Adam he said if you'll
[46:34] do these things I'll do this when God
[46:37] made a covenant with Noah he said if
[46:40] you'll do this then I'll do this when he
[46:43] made a covenant with Abraham he just
[46:45] said I will and so brother brandham said
[46:48] it was an unconditional
[46:51] Covenant unconditional Covenant I love
[46:54] that so uh he said Abraham was the
[46:58] beginning of our faith is that right oh
[47:01] Abraham had the promise and God called
[47:04] Abraham he said because he was a great
[47:06] man I guess he said no sir he come down
[47:09] out of Babylon in the land of Cala in
[47:12] the city of Earth and God called him and
[47:14] made his Covenant with him
[47:18] unconditionally unconditionally he said
[47:20] I'm going to save you and not only you
[47:23] Abraham but your
[47:25] seed unconditionally but said he was
[47:27] determined to save Abraham he was
[47:30] determined to save you aren't you glad
[47:33] that when God came down he didn't ask
[47:35] your opinion about it he said he was
[47:37] determined to save you Brother Sam he
[47:39] was determined you be in his family he
[47:41] was determined why he saw you before the
[47:44] foundation of the earth he was
[47:46] determined that you would be his child
[47:49] so he said I'm going to save you not
[47:51] only you but your seed unconditionally
[47:53] he was determined to say man listen
[47:55] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[47:58] the Father which has sent me draw him
[48:02] and I will raise him up at the last day
[48:06] he said you can't even come to me you
[48:08] can't follow me unless my father draws
[48:11] you right draws you John 15:16 you have
[48:15] not chosen
[48:17] me that ought to put the end to all of
[48:19] that right there he said I went looking
[48:21] for God I I did this and I did that he
[48:23] said you didn't choose me you didn't
[48:26] choose to be a believer in a message of
[48:28] the hour you didn't choose there was
[48:30] something inside of you he said you did
[48:32] not choose me but I chose you oh that
[48:36] gives me Comfort brother Bill that gives
[48:37] me Comfort that gives me the ability
[48:40] what does it do takes it out of my hands
[48:43] sir
[48:45] unconditional you have not chosen me I
[48:47] have chosen you and ordained you that
[48:49] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[48:51] that your fruit should remain that
[48:53] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[48:55] in my name he may give it to you so he
[48:57] said you've been
[48:59] chosen I just love this you've been
[49:02] chosen for a purpose and he said you're
[49:04] going to have
[49:05] fruit it's going to come out of your
[49:08] life and your fruit is going to be
[49:10] remain in other words it's going to uh
[49:12] be good fruit it's going to be
[49:14] continuing fruit it's going to be useful
[49:18] fruit whatever comes out of your life is
[49:20] going to be something God can use and
[49:23] God can use because he's the one that
[49:24] did it he said so I've ordains you that
[49:28] you should go and you should bring forth
[49:29] fruit so the believer works but the it's
[49:33] not the believer doing the work but it's
[49:34] God doing the work sir he said I
[49:37] ordained you for that sir I have chosen
[49:40] you for that that your fruit or your
[49:43] works the things that you do would
[49:45] remain I've chosen you for that and that
[49:48] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[49:50] in my name he may give it to you so he
[49:52] said I've chosen you to reach a place of
[49:54] maturity that you can speak the word
[49:56] word and things will begin to come to to
[49:58] pass you that's what this message is all
[50:01] about it's bringing us to that place of
[50:03] maturity but we wouldn't be no good to
[50:05] have a message if God didn't choose you
[50:08] but God did choose you aren't you glad
[50:10] that he did I'm always amazed to hear
[50:13] stories about people that come to the
[50:15] message that weren't raised in the
[50:16] message or weren't around it we love
[50:18] those that were raised in the message we
[50:20] want to nurture them as well and bring
[50:22] them up I was raised around a message
[50:23] home but yet I hear so many stories of
[50:26] people that hear about the message
[50:28] something happens in their life and
[50:29] brother West and them you you guys
[50:31] understand that you just one day you you
[50:33] come to a crisis in your life and and
[50:35] you and you find out about a prophet or
[50:37] you go back to listening to a prophet
[50:38] and you realize what God was doing I
[50:40] knew a man had come out of Memphis he
[50:42] was uh uh he was a Pentecostal Church of
[50:45] God Pentecostal man and he knew nothing
[50:47] about the message but his wife actually
[50:50] God spoke the name of William brandom to
[50:52] his wife he come in the message and his
[50:55] wife left him over it
[50:59] but that's how he come to God literally
[51:00] spoke to her she was a gifted woman but
[51:03] she couldn't receive the message but it
[51:05] was for
[51:06] him oh my it was God calling
[51:09] him and he's a Believer to this day God
[51:13] called him God called you so that your
[51:16] fruit might remain and whatever you ask
[51:19] the father in my name he said he may
[51:21] give it to you brother BR said the call
[51:22] that God gave was a supernatural call
[51:25] yeah right it was super beyond your
[51:27] abilities beyond your abilities to
[51:29] understand Supernatural not natural
[51:31] Supernatural he said but yet it never
[51:33] staggered Abraham no time he always knew
[51:36] it was God he said God's callings are
[51:39] Supernatural there's nothing natural God
[51:42] takes the Supernatural and works it out
[51:44] in the natural but the callings of God
[51:47] are Supernatural the Bible said gifts
[51:49] and callings are without repentance see
[51:51] it's for ordained by God now we know
[51:55] that with Abra and I won't hold you too
[51:57] long tonight because I know you're
[51:58] getting ready to go and have a nice day
[52:00] with your family but I'm so glad that
[52:02] you come and and I hate that you have to
[52:05] hear me this afternoon but we'll do the
[52:07] best we can but it it's a good thing
[52:10] that it was unconditional because
[52:12] Abraham
[52:13] immediately starts making
[52:16] mistakes he don't wait any
[52:19] time right the father of our faith
[52:23] immediately starts making mistakes soon
[52:26] as he's called his first mistake was a
[52:29] lack of
[52:30] Separation right and a lot of us can say
[52:33] Amen to that his first mistake was a
[52:36] lack of total separation Genesis 12:5 it
[52:39] says Abraham Abram took Sarah his wife
[52:42] and lot his brother's son and remember
[52:45] what did God just tell him separate from
[52:48] your
[52:49] Kindred right lot was his Kindred and
[52:52] the thing about lot was Abraham was
[52:54] always trying to help lot but he
[52:55] couldn't ever really be a blessing to
[52:57] lot until they were
[52:59] separate right he tried to help him all
[53:01] this time but he couldn't really help
[53:03] him until until he was in his right
[53:06] position and lot was in his because lot
[53:08] was a penny and he would never be a
[53:10] silver dollar he had a place in the
[53:12] economy of God but he would never be in
[53:14] Abraham he wasn't called to what Abraham
[53:16] was called to and many times the
[53:18] mistakes we make in our life is because
[53:19] we're trying to make somebody else be
[53:21] what we are and believe what we believe
[53:23] and do what we do no you can't make them
[53:25] do that they are what they are are let
[53:27] them be what they are but you be a
[53:30] silver dollar you follow the call of
[53:33] God so he told him to
[53:36] separate BR say he another thing he told
[53:38] him to do to separate himself now from
[53:40] his Kindred and all of his people he
[53:42] said God in order to get a man or a
[53:43] woman a boy or a girl to obey him you
[53:47] have to separate yourself from all
[53:49] someone say all from all unbelief he
[53:53] said that's right until you totally
[53:55] separate yourself from anything contrary
[53:58] to that word and believe it God calls
[54:01] for a total
[54:02] separation wasn't a request God
[54:05] commanded him get out from among your
[54:07] Kindred yeah all right now brother look
[54:11] Abraham is all Mortals not an immortal
[54:13] man not a man that can't make a mistake
[54:17] right you see how we build up these men
[54:19] sometimes we make them Immortal men but
[54:22] they're not Immortal men they're mortal
[54:24] men sir right that's a mistake for us to
[54:27] build them up like that because that God
[54:30] will allow something to happen that'll
[54:32] diminish them in our eyes if we're not
[54:34] careful even a pastor or somebody like
[54:36] that so Abraham is all Mortals not an
[54:39] immortal man not a man that can't make a
[54:41] mistake but constantly made mistakes but
[54:44] no matter how many mistakes he made his
[54:47] anchor still held for he had the promise
[54:51] oh doesn't that make you feel good about
[54:53] about being a Christian today doesn't
[54:55] that make you feel good good about being
[54:56] called by God he constantly made
[54:58] mistakes and you might come and say
[55:00] brother Ben I feel like I'm constantly
[55:02] making mistakes so did Abraham but God
[55:05] called
[55:06] him but see the thing he did he didn't
[55:08] quit all right he didn't go back to her
[55:12] he didn't stop being with Abraham he
[55:14] believed amen he believed God and he
[55:18] staggered not at the promise of God
[55:20] right amen listen he had the promise he
[55:25] took with him Sarah he took lot he took
[55:27] his daddy and as long as they was with
[55:29] him God could not bless him the old man
[55:31] finally died and they buried him he went
[55:33] on up a little further and lot back said
[55:36] he said you know what happened there and
[55:37] then he separated himself from him he
[55:40] said then God appeared to him again and
[55:42] said now Abraham look all over the
[55:43] ground it's all yours when he made the
[55:46] right choice that's it separates
[55:47] yourself from everything so our choices
[55:49] do have consequences but you're still
[55:51] Gods Abraham made a mistake made the
[55:54] wrong choice but God was leading him to
[55:56] the right
[55:57] choice he said maybe he said when you
[56:00] made the right choice separate yourself
[56:02] from everything maybe that's the reason
[56:03] some of us are not getting along so well
[56:05] he said we're holding on to things we
[56:07] ought to let go in the
[56:08] separation he said now what are the
[56:11] things you have to let go of you say
[56:12] well maybe that's my wife my husband my
[56:14] church that's not what he said he said a
[56:18] little doubt right come on preach with
[56:21] me this afternoon a little doubt
[56:24] separate yourself from a little doubt
[56:27] separate yourself from a little
[56:29] wonder wonder if that's right a wonder
[56:31] if that's right a little
[56:34] skeptic these are things we need to
[56:36] separate ourselves from he said wonder
[56:39] if it's right could this be could that
[56:40] be how could it be cut loose this
[56:43] morning oh that's what we ought to do
[56:45] cut loose and separate oursel from
[56:47] everything that would be against the
[56:49] word we should lay aside every unbelief
[56:52] that so easily besets us separate from
[56:54] it yet Abraham being the father of Faith
[56:57] he was slow to obey when it come to his
[56:59] family and many times that's the case
[57:01] with us but the Covenant was still
[57:05] unconditional I'm so glad it was God
[57:08] didn't fail Abraham failed but God
[57:10] didn't fail right maybe we'll talk more
[57:12] about that some other time Abraham's
[57:14] second mistake was leaving
[57:16] Canaan God told him to go to Canaan he
[57:19] didn't tell him to
[57:20] leave right and he went but then he he
[57:24] got in trouble he got in a in a in a
[57:26] drought and he left Genesis 12:9 Abram
[57:29] journeyed going on still toward the
[57:31] South there was a famine in the land and
[57:33] Abram went down into Egypt to sourn
[57:36] there for the famine was Grievous in the
[57:39] land brother R said that Abraham come
[57:42] out of the and sure crossed over the
[57:43] river of Euphrates many of you did when
[57:46] you was baptized you know that's what
[57:47] you were doing you were like Abraham
[57:49] when you were baptize you crossing over
[57:51] the river you know what that that that's
[57:54] what a Hebrew means it's HEB who passes
[57:56] over that's why they called Abraham the
[57:58] Hebrew he who passed over the river
[58:01] Euphrates he left Oh my he he was
[58:04] baptized he passed over you passed from
[58:06] being a sinner to being a Christian
[58:08] right yeah right and so you you crossed
[58:12] over and yet he had crossed over but yet
[58:15] he didn't stay there he went on down
[58:18] into
[58:19] Egypt he said now many of you crossed
[58:22] the river Euphrates was baptized come to
[58:23] the land now don't take right back down
[58:25] to Egypt stay right here in the
[58:28] land oh church we can only realize that
[58:31] you don't need to go down just CU you
[58:33] say well I'm dry I'm I'm discouraged I'm
[58:35] upset don't go down into Egypt and look
[58:37] for their uh their kind of uh life
[58:40] sustaining thing but go in stay in the
[58:43] land that's where God wants you it may
[58:44] be tough but that's where he wants you
[58:46] to be right I know sometimes it's hard I
[58:50] know sometimes we get to feeling uh
[58:53] unspiritual can I say it that way and
[58:56] when we feel unspiritual but JT we want
[58:58] to we don't really want to be in
[59:01] church it's the last place we want to be
[59:03] and the place we need to
[59:06] be that's not the time to leave that's
[59:08] the time to get right into the house of
[59:11] God that's the time to get closer to him
[59:15] when you don't feel like it that's the
[59:16] time to get down on your knees and
[59:18] really cry out to God yes now look he
[59:22] said stay right under the Holy Spirit
[59:25] stay right in don't pattern yourself
[59:27] after somebody in the world don't
[59:28] pattern yourself after him see watch him
[59:31] watch his life he said don't act like so
[59:33] and so does sister Susie or brother
[59:34] Jackson or whoever it might be don't
[59:36] look like he said don't act like them
[59:38] you just walk with him sir right feel my
[59:41] way every day with love as I walk with
[59:44] the Heavenly just stay right with him
[59:46] watch how it sweetens you and cuts all
[59:48] the world away he said oh my you don't
[59:51] care what the people says you're walking
[59:52] with
[59:53] God but Abraham goes down into egyp
[59:56] Egypt as many of us
[59:58] did if we were honest after we got
[1:00:04] baptized because God still had work to
[1:00:06] do in his life there was still
[1:00:08] sanctification there was still
[1:00:09] separation there was still the Holy
[1:00:11] Ghost the seal
[1:00:13] circumcision but Genesis 12:11 says it
[1:00:15] came to pass when he was come near to
[1:00:17] enter into Egypt he said said unto Sarah
[1:00:21] his wife behold now I know that thou art
[1:00:22] a fair woman to look
[1:00:24] upon this is a strange story I'm
[1:00:31] sorry imagine taking your wife down down
[1:00:34] among amongst a foreign country while
[1:00:37] we're here we're not going to be married
[1:00:39] cuz you're so beautiful number one
[1:00:41] Abraham thought a lot of his
[1:00:44] wife but you're so beautiful that
[1:00:47] they're going to kill me and take you so
[1:00:51] he says he some of y'all think like that
[1:00:53] about your wives don't you said they're
[1:00:56] going to kill me and take you so just
[1:00:58] say you're my my my brother or my sister
[1:01:01] which was a a white lie right it was
[1:01:03] technically the truth it wasn't all the
[1:01:07] truth CU they was half brother and
[1:01:09] sister so he said therefore should come
[1:01:12] to pass Egyptians shall see thee that
[1:01:14] they shall say this is his wife they
[1:01:16] will kill me they will save thee alive I
[1:01:18] pray thee say I pray thee Thou Art my
[1:01:20] sister that it may be well with thee for
[1:01:22] thy with me for thy sake and my soul
[1:01:24] shall live because of Thee boy Abraham
[1:01:26] had a yellow
[1:01:28] streak he was the father of Faith but
[1:01:32] he's got a streak of yellow and mile
[1:01:35] long he
[1:01:38] does now come on ain't knock none of us
[1:01:40] have ever been yellow you
[1:01:42] know afraid to do what God told us to do
[1:01:45] afraid to admit we were a believer in
[1:01:48] certain company all right
[1:01:52] right and Sarah does what Abraham told
[1:01:54] her she's a good wife
[1:01:56] and Abraham's fears came
[1:01:58] true probably wouldn't have done nothing
[1:02:00] about it if he hadn't said anything but
[1:02:03] the fact that he's back that he's out of
[1:02:05] the land and his fears come true and all
[1:02:08] the time Abraham now if you go read it
[1:02:11] you can read it all Abraham is making
[1:02:13] money on the
[1:02:14] deal that's true Abraham actually
[1:02:18] Pharaoh starts giving him stuff because
[1:02:19] he wants to marry his sister
[1:02:26] you know it it's funny how God makes
[1:02:29] those things is this cutting out on me
[1:02:31] I'm going to change mics I need a better
[1:02:34] mic anyway this afternoon y'all need to
[1:02:36] hear
[1:02:39] me so the Lord uh actually he you know
[1:02:43] Pharaoh's giving him money and the Lord
[1:02:45] begins to plague Pharaoh Genesis 12:17
[1:02:47] with great plagues because of Sarah
[1:02:48] Abraham's wife and Pharaoh called Abram
[1:02:50] and said what is this that thou Hast
[1:02:52] done unto me why did thou not tell me
[1:02:54] that she was thy wife why said th she's
[1:02:56] my sister so I might have taken her to
[1:02:58] me to wife he said now therefore Behold
[1:03:01] thy wife take her and go thy way now
[1:03:04] watch he he immediately makes a mistake
[1:03:07] goes down and lies to somebody and seems
[1:03:11] to get away with it brother BR said
[1:03:13] Abraham no special man come down from
[1:03:16] the Tower of Babel perhaps come out of
[1:03:17] an idolator Bunch his father come down
[1:03:19] in the land of Shar down there to dwell
[1:03:21] in the city of er while he was there God
[1:03:23] spoke to him by grace
[1:03:26] not because he was different not because
[1:03:28] he was a better man but by Grace God
[1:03:30] called him the Bible clearly makes that
[1:03:32] known he said oh Abraham how Abraham he
[1:03:35] said oh Abraham how Abraham tested God's
[1:03:41] patience and sometimes I just want to
[1:03:43] put my name in
[1:03:45] there oh Benjamin how Benjamin tested
[1:03:49] God's patience oh you can probably put
[1:03:51] your name in there too right we how he
[1:03:54] tested his patience
[1:03:56] told him said Abraham stay in this land
[1:03:59] don't you go out of it but as soon as a
[1:04:02] famine come Abraham
[1:04:03] run he said Abraham spoke of
[1:04:08] us God took Abraham by grace and saved
[1:04:11] him and that's how he takes you by grace
[1:04:14] and how do we test his patience oh my
[1:04:17] today we're up tomorrow we're down one
[1:04:19] day we believe the next day we're
[1:04:20] wondering today we're a Methodist
[1:04:22] tomorrow we're a Baptist today we
[1:04:24] believe in Divine Healing tomorrow
[1:04:25] tomorrow the tummy a comes and we don't
[1:04:27] know whether we believe it or not but
[1:04:29] yet in the midst of all of that God
[1:04:31] wants us to stay put he said he said he
[1:04:33] wants us to stay put but he saves us
[1:04:36] anyhow if it wasn't the grace of God
[1:04:39] we'd all be gone oh how many can say
[1:04:41] Amen to that today if it wasn't for the
[1:04:43] grace of God we'd all be gone sure God
[1:04:46] Saves Us by his
[1:04:48] grace Abraham was supposed to stay in
[1:04:50] that land but he went down into the
[1:04:52] calans he said or the Philistines went
[1:04:54] down there to sourn to get out of of
[1:04:55] famine things a little hard up in his
[1:04:57] country so he went down a journey down
[1:04:59] there with them done exactly what God
[1:05:01] told him not to do but yet the grace of
[1:05:02] God appeared to him kept the king from
[1:05:05] taking his wife the grace of God Abraham
[1:05:07] said it's my sister lied about it but
[1:05:09] yet the grace of God held him because he
[1:05:13] repented now look how he slips at he
[1:05:15] repented that's important Abraham
[1:05:18] repented right he said he didn't just
[1:05:21] get B by with it like we think he
[1:05:23] repented he said it's my sister lied
[1:05:25] about it yet the grace of God held him
[1:05:27] because he repented he was willing to
[1:05:30] repent he said and anybody someone say
[1:05:33] anybody anybody that's willing to repent
[1:05:37] the grace of God still goes for
[1:05:40] you Hallelujah the grace of God is
[1:05:43] searching for you so that goes for you
[1:05:46] backsliders this morning he said the
[1:05:48] grace of God is still looking for you if
[1:05:50] you'll just repent God's grace is
[1:05:53] sufficient but he's looking for someone
[1:05:55] who's willing to repent not someone who
[1:05:57] said I'm doing good I'm doing good I'm
[1:05:59] doing good no someone who's willing to
[1:06:00] say I'm a sinner but I need the help of
[1:06:06] God now I'll be completely honest with
[1:06:09] you the first time Abraham does that
[1:06:10] doesn't bother me much but it's that
[1:06:13] second
[1:06:15] time because you realize Abraham does
[1:06:17] this again
[1:06:19] after meeting
[1:06:22] Elohim after his body change because
[1:06:26] brother random identifies Sarah and said
[1:06:28] look here goes old grandma with a Shaw
[1:06:30] on going down the land of the
[1:06:32] Philistines right and he said no she
[1:06:35] wasn't old grandma she' had her body
[1:06:37] change
[1:06:39] right after meeting
[1:06:42] Elohim Abraham
[1:06:44] again makes the same
[1:06:48] mistake now I'll be honest with you that
[1:06:51] offends my Wesley and Holiness
[1:06:52] sensibilities
[1:06:58] one shot and you're
[1:07:00] out
[1:07:03] right come on it
[1:07:06] does it does but God had
[1:07:09] Grace if you want it you got don't want
[1:07:12] it all right see the most important
[1:07:14] thing in your life and in my life is the
[1:07:16] attitude that we come to God with that's
[1:07:19] the most important thing the single most
[1:07:21] important thing the only way to get
[1:07:22] anything out of the service is to come
[1:07:24] with an attitude Lord I I want something
[1:07:25] from you today I need something from you
[1:07:27] Lord I I'm desperate for you today it's
[1:07:30] the only way to get anything you say
[1:07:31] well brother Ben I've been to church and
[1:07:33] it don't do nothing for me but because
[1:07:34] you didn't come with the right attitude
[1:07:37] but if you'll come expecting God to move
[1:07:39] god'll move you said well we haven't had
[1:07:41] a move of God in a while we haven't seen
[1:07:43] much Shadow R the AIS I tell you what if
[1:07:45] you if that's what you need you come
[1:07:47] expecting and watch God begin to
[1:07:50] move begin to expect God to save the
[1:07:52] Lost begin to expect God to do something
[1:07:54] begin to expect God to move as only he
[1:07:58] can but we got to come with the right
[1:08:01] attitude attitude of
[1:08:03] repentance but it does kind of offend me
[1:08:06] a little bit that Abraham went
[1:08:09] twice did the same thing but he was
[1:08:13] still God's
[1:08:14] man Genesis chapter 20 Abraham journeyed
[1:08:18] from this toward the South Country dwell
[1:08:21] between Kadesh and Sher and sojourned in
[1:08:23] guar land of the Philippines
[1:08:26] and Abraham said of Sarah his wife she
[1:08:29] is my
[1:08:32] sister and ailec king of garent and took
[1:08:36] Sarah oh my now brother Brandon said
[1:08:39] that ailec was a Holiness
[1:08:42] man that's what he said he was a holy a
[1:08:45] righteous
[1:08:46] man and so God protected him from taking
[1:08:50] a prophet's wife so she had come into
[1:08:54] His household but he had not yet that
[1:08:57] that uh he had not taken her as his wife
[1:09:00] and so uh you remember uh that night
[1:09:04] brother Bram said he had a dream and God
[1:09:06] said you're as good as a dead man and
[1:09:09] when he had that dream ailec got up the
[1:09:11] next morning he said to Abraham what
[1:09:13] sawest thou that thou has done this
[1:09:15] thing I love AMC's respect to a prophet
[1:09:20] that he said what what caused you to do
[1:09:21] this well wasn't his prophetic Insight
[1:09:24] that caused to do it is because Abraham
[1:09:26] was a little bit of a liar
[1:09:29] right thank God for the Holy Ghost today
[1:09:33] right but Abraham was he told a truth
[1:09:37] something that wasn't true but yet he
[1:09:39] said what did you
[1:09:41] see and Abraham said because I thought
[1:09:44] surely the fear of God is not in this
[1:09:46] place we might be surprised where we
[1:09:48] find the fear of God he said and they
[1:09:51] will slay me for my wife's sake the same
[1:09:53] fear he had before he said yeah indeed
[1:09:56] she is my sister she's the daughter of
[1:09:58] my father but not the daughter of my
[1:09:59] mother she became my wife now this was
[1:10:02] pre-planned and I want you to notice
[1:10:04] that a lot of times when we fail God
[1:10:06] many times it's because of something
[1:10:09] that's been going on for a long time and
[1:10:12] we never deal with it and then it pops
[1:10:13] up now this when they first got married
[1:10:15] and God first called them he said it
[1:10:17] came to pass when God caused me to
[1:10:19] wonder from my father's house I said
[1:10:20] unto her this is the kindness which Thou
[1:10:22] shalt show unto me and every place
[1:10:24] whether we shall come say of me he is my
[1:10:27] brother and and and so he had taught her
[1:10:30] to lie every time they got out of the
[1:10:32] land of Canaan because he was scared but
[1:10:35] notice it never happened in the land oh
[1:10:38] church we need to stay on fire for God
[1:10:40] we need to stay where God called us to
[1:10:43] be but the covenant's
[1:10:47] unconditional amen and ailec took sheep
[1:10:50] and oxen men's servants and women's
[1:10:52] servants this is a strange response I'm
[1:10:54] sorry gave them to Abraham and restored
[1:10:57] him Sarah his wife and AMC said behold
[1:11:01] my land is before thee dwell where it
[1:11:03] pleaseth thee and unto Sarah he said
[1:11:06] behold I've given thy brother a thousand
[1:11:08] pieces of silver love that he calls that
[1:11:10] his her brother in that place I've given
[1:11:13] thy brother thy brother wink and Nod a
[1:11:15] thousand pieces of silver behold is he
[1:11:18] is to thee a covering of the eyes unto
[1:11:20] all that are with thee with all other
[1:11:21] thus was she reproved now look this next
[1:11:25] verse is
[1:11:27] remarkable verse 17 so Abraham prayed
[1:11:29] unto God and God healed aimc and his
[1:11:34] wife and his maid servants and they bear
[1:11:37] children it's interesting that God
[1:11:40] cursed them with the same that problem
[1:11:42] that Abraham
[1:11:43] had remember he couldn't have kids right
[1:11:47] until Isaac was born but here this is
[1:11:50] during that time Abraham has had the
[1:11:52] same issue and now the king of gar is
[1:11:55] going to have that AMC's going to have
[1:11:57] that same that same issue and and
[1:12:00] because he has taken Sarah and it's
[1:12:02] already begin to show up in his
[1:12:03] household and Abraham prayed for them
[1:12:06] and they bear children now it doesn't
[1:12:08] make any sense to a
[1:12:10] legalist why God would let Abraham go
[1:12:13] down there but but I want you to look at
[1:12:15] ailec aimc is not respecting what
[1:12:19] Abraham did he's respecting who Abraham
[1:12:23] was
[1:12:25] right Abraham was a prophet you're a
[1:12:27] child of God right he was respecting the
[1:12:30] office and the position that he held
[1:12:33] I'll say this we ought to have more
[1:12:35] respect in the day and age we live in
[1:12:37] for God's men for the office of a
[1:12:39] whether it's a pastor or a deacon or
[1:12:40] whatever it is we got to have respect
[1:12:42] for that because God that person may do
[1:12:45] something that's not right they may do
[1:12:47] something you disagree with but even if
[1:12:48] you disagree with the person which is
[1:12:50] entirely okay don't don't disrespect the
[1:12:53] position because God will still honor
[1:12:56] that position right Elisha and the and
[1:12:59] the she Bears remember they come out and
[1:13:01] ate up the children brother B said that
[1:13:02] was not the spirit of Christ right God
[1:13:05] wouldn't have done that but he backed up
[1:13:07] his prophet's word so we need to respect
[1:13:10] God's men now he the next verse again
[1:13:14] that was just so remarkable Abraham had
[1:13:16] to pray for them brother said this king
[1:13:17] of gar fell in love with her and Abraham
[1:13:19] lied and said that's my sister he said
[1:13:21] this is going to shock Holiness people
[1:13:23] he said that's my sister so you find out
[1:13:25] that night after he took his bath I love
[1:13:27] the way brother brand dramatizes it he
[1:13:29] said he laid out and stretched his big
[1:13:31] feet out in the
[1:13:34] bed and you just see him laying there
[1:13:36] you know and he's so big you know he's
[1:13:38] got big guy you know and his feet are
[1:13:40] out under the covers he's sitting there
[1:13:42] wiggling his toes you know boy he's had
[1:13:44] a good day he found another pretty woman
[1:13:46] for his household you know and take for
[1:13:48] his wife he oh my this is the time and
[1:13:51] he said oh my Lord I'm so happy you gave
[1:13:52] me this pretty girl ignorant all the
[1:13:55] time of the fact there was another man's
[1:13:57] wife not to mention she was 90 years
[1:13:59] [Laughter]
[1:14:04] old they kind of left that part out she
[1:14:07] didn't look
[1:14:09] it ignorant all the time of the fact it
[1:14:11] was another man's wife he said and while
[1:14:13] he was laying there you can see him just
[1:14:15] laying there just pleased with himself
[1:14:17] now he said well remember he was a
[1:14:19] righteous man and so while he went to
[1:14:21] sleep the Lord come to him and said
[1:14:23] you're just as good as a dead man why he
[1:14:25] said' Lord why am I as good as a dead
[1:14:27] man he said well you got another man's
[1:14:28] wife out there see God and His Sovereign
[1:14:31] Grace protecting that stream of blood
[1:14:34] which come
[1:14:35] Jesus Hallelujah he said that's right
[1:14:38] God will do it don't you worry oh church
[1:14:41] we can just get away with all the worry
[1:14:42] today do away with all of it you can't
[1:14:44] make somebody a Christian stop worrying
[1:14:47] about it you say if everybody was nicer
[1:14:49] they'd be a Christian if everybody
[1:14:50] treated them better they'd be a
[1:14:51] Christian you can't make somebody a
[1:14:53] Christian
[1:14:55] you you don't worry about that don't you
[1:14:57] worry God will do it he'll take care of
[1:14:59] the rest of it you just let him alone he
[1:15:01] said just commit yourself to him he will
[1:15:03] take care of the rest sir he told aimc
[1:15:05] said you're as good as a dead
[1:15:07] man why he said Lord you know the
[1:15:09] Integrity of my heart why he said you
[1:15:12] know that she told me that's my brother
[1:15:13] and he told me that's my sister he said
[1:15:14] yeah I know it I know it I know the
[1:15:16] Integrity of your heart and that's the
[1:15:18] reason I kept you from sinning against
[1:15:21] me he said look here's Grace I know
[1:15:23] you're a good man righteous man and
[1:15:25] everything he said but I'll not hear
[1:15:27] your prayer her husband is my prophet he
[1:15:31] said think of it a little liar now some
[1:15:34] of you kind of held back when I called
[1:15:36] Abraham a liar brother brandham did on
[1:15:38] multiple occasions he said a little liar
[1:15:42] backslid you say brother brandom I done
[1:15:44] something the other day I'm afraid the
[1:15:46] Lord won't heal me
[1:15:48] tonight I deal with this all the time as
[1:15:50] a
[1:15:51] pastor I deal with this all the time
[1:15:54] people come to church and they're
[1:15:55] sitting there convicted with
[1:15:57] condemnation saying oh I you know the
[1:16:00] way I've been acting I can't be
[1:16:02] healed I I I can't come to the Al I
[1:16:05] can't I can't worship so they just sit
[1:16:07] there all
[1:16:09] right and brother brand said Oh my he
[1:16:12] said oh yes he
[1:16:15] will oh yes he will don't you get scared
[1:16:21] you're a Christian you may have done
[1:16:23] something wrong but you're a Christian
[1:16:24] yeah sir you may have stepped outside
[1:16:27] Canaan for a little while and said
[1:16:28] something wrong or done something wrong
[1:16:30] but you're a Christian that's why you
[1:16:32] apologize that's why you repent you're a
[1:16:34] Christian just sit still repent for what
[1:16:37] you done and go
[1:16:40] on you say well I back said brother
[1:16:42] don't make any difference repent and go
[1:16:43] on see you're scared the first little
[1:16:47] thing comes along you turn your head one
[1:16:48] way now come on Brothers you know this
[1:16:50] the truth you turn your head one way and
[1:16:53] you think God's going to condemn you
[1:16:54] repent
[1:16:55] that's all doesn't make it right don't
[1:16:57] do it again but
[1:16:59] repent huh now he said that's all get
[1:17:04] right now look he said there was Abraham
[1:17:07] and anyone knows that God told Abraham
[1:17:08] not to leave Palestine and anytime that
[1:17:11] a person disobeys God he
[1:17:13] backslides there might be a whole lot
[1:17:15] more backsliding people than we
[1:17:18] realize anytime a person disobeys God he
[1:17:20] backslides because a drought come on
[1:17:23] Abraham instead of standing fa in the
[1:17:25] music he went and done exactly what God
[1:17:27] told him not to do so if you do what God
[1:17:29] tells you not to do you're backslid so
[1:17:31] Abraham was sitting out there backslid
[1:17:33] and telling a lie but God couldn't turn
[1:17:35] his child down Hallelujah God couldn't
[1:17:38] turn his child down he give him the
[1:17:40] promise
[1:17:42] unconditionally he said that's my
[1:17:44] Prophet you take his wife back and
[1:17:46] restore him if if don't you're as good
[1:17:48] as a dead man let him pray for you who
[1:17:51] Hallelujah who not that holier than thou
[1:17:53] are but my Prophet sitting out out there
[1:17:55] I'll hear his prayer Hallelujah there's
[1:17:58] the grace of God to the Holy Ghost
[1:17:59] Church oh do you believe you're the Holy
[1:18:01] Ghost Church today there's the grace of
[1:18:03] God to the Holy Ghost Church he said and
[1:18:05] you don't recognize it if we recognize
[1:18:07] it we'd be more free you know it if we
[1:18:09] recognize it we'd worship a little more
[1:18:11] free we'd be able to get into the
[1:18:12] service a little bit more cuz we'd
[1:18:14] realize it's not by our own Merit but
[1:18:16] it's by the almighty grace of God it's
[1:18:19] by his favor that we are where we are
[1:18:21] and who we
[1:18:22] are Hallelujah
[1:18:25] Abraham made his biggest mistake with
[1:18:29] ishmail maybe we'll get more into
[1:18:30] ishmail too at another date but it was a
[1:18:32] huge
[1:18:33] mistake ishmail was the seed of Promise
[1:18:35] slightly doubted that's what brother
[1:18:38] brand said the seed of Promise slightly
[1:18:40] doubted but just because the promise was
[1:18:42] unconditional doesn't mean Abraham
[1:18:44] couldn't make a
[1:18:45] mistake it just means God wouldn't give
[1:18:48] up on
[1:18:49] him amen he made his mistake he
[1:18:52] corrected him for it and he come right
[1:18:54] back back 13 years later and Isaac is
[1:18:59] born and when God speaks to to Abraham
[1:19:05] in Genesis 17 he speaks to him about
[1:19:08] ishmail or he speaks to him about Isaac
[1:19:10] begins to tell him what's going to
[1:19:12] happen and Abraham ishmail being about
[1:19:14] 13 years old at the time Abraham said to
[1:19:17] God all that ishmail might live before
[1:19:20] thee now think of the the carnality of
[1:19:23] of Abraham
[1:19:25] right even though he believed the
[1:19:26] promise sir but he said oh that that
[1:19:29] ishmail could be the Fulfillment of that
[1:19:31] right because it was even a miracle that
[1:19:33] ishmail was
[1:19:34] born but it wasn't by Sarah it wasn't
[1:19:37] God's provided
[1:19:38] way right and it speaks of
[1:19:40] denominationalism it speaks of false
[1:19:42] Doctrine it speaks of every slightly
[1:19:44] doubted
[1:19:45] promise but it becomes a wild man and it
[1:19:48] becomes what Ishmael is today he said oh
[1:19:51] that ishmail might live before theee see
[1:19:54] a prophet I've told you this before a
[1:19:56] prophet's desire is not thus sayith the
[1:20:00] Lord a prophet's desire what a prophet
[1:20:03] wants is not thus sayith the Lord but
[1:20:06] it's what a prophet speaks under
[1:20:08] inspiration that's thus sayeth the Lord
[1:20:10] because Abraham wanted ishmail to be the
[1:20:13] boy but God said it's going to be it's
[1:20:16] going to be Isaac and God said Sarah thy
[1:20:18] wife shall bear thee a son indeed and
[1:20:20] thou shalt call his name Isaac and I
[1:20:22] will establish my Covenant with him for
[1:20:24] an Everlasting Covenant and with his
[1:20:26] seed after him brother BR said this and
[1:20:29] I I'm I'm not going to hold you much
[1:20:31] longer this afternoon but he said this
[1:20:33] about Abraham and ishel he said he done
[1:20:34] made him a promise he said you know he
[1:20:37] said right then Abraham would have
[1:20:39] failed but the promise is
[1:20:42] unconditional the Covenant is
[1:20:46] unconditional how can we understand an
[1:20:50] unconditional Covenant I begin to ponder
[1:20:52] on this because I thought how I don't
[1:20:53] because every that I make is conditional
[1:20:57] right if I tell you that I'm going to
[1:20:59] meet you in the morning at 8:00 that's
[1:21:00] conditional on me waking
[1:21:02] up right and getting up and getting in
[1:21:04] my car my car starting and me getting up
[1:21:07] you know it may be it may be probable
[1:21:11] but it's not impossible that I could
[1:21:13] break
[1:21:14] that right so I I know that as a
[1:21:19] covenant maker because that's what a
[1:21:21] covenant is a promise that I can make
[1:21:24] you a promise and it's very rarely
[1:21:27] uncond there's very few unconditional
[1:21:29] covenants there are a
[1:21:30] few and think about it what's an
[1:21:32] unconditional Covenant well an
[1:21:34] unconditional Covenant you made an
[1:21:35] unconditional Covenant when you got
[1:21:37] married you realize that marriage is an
[1:21:40] unconditional
[1:21:43] Covenant boy got
[1:21:45] quiet some of y'all fixing to anyway
[1:21:49] look it's an unconditional Covenant God
[1:21:53] didn't say if she behaves if he behaves
[1:21:57] that's not the Covenant you
[1:21:59] made it's oh my it's for better for
[1:22:04] worse in sickness and in health in
[1:22:08] poverty or in Rich whatever it is it's
[1:22:10] unconditional that's one Covenant
[1:22:12] marriage covenant is an unconditional
[1:22:15] Covenant and another Covenant now think
[1:22:19] about this another relationship that we
[1:22:22] have that's unconditional is is our
[1:22:26] children right we love them
[1:22:29] unconditionally does that make sense
[1:22:31] Jehovah is Abraham's
[1:22:34] father and he loves
[1:22:37] him and in Revelation 3:19 he tells us
[1:22:40] something about this love he said as
[1:22:42] many as I love I rebuke and chasen it
[1:22:45] don't sound much like love does it but
[1:22:47] it is love be zealous therefore and
[1:22:52] repent now look brother in the church
[1:22:55] age book and I don't have time to read
[1:22:56] all of this but you can find It's a
[1:22:57] Wonderful study brother BR said let us
[1:22:59] examine the first phrase as many as I
[1:23:01] love in the Greek the emphasis is upon
[1:23:03] the personal pronoun I he does not say
[1:23:05] as many would feel or as many would feel
[1:23:07] he should say as many as love me no sir
[1:23:10] we must never try to make Jesus the
[1:23:13] object of human love in this verse it is
[1:23:15] the many that are the loved ones of God
[1:23:19] it is his love in question not ours as
[1:23:23] many as I love
[1:23:25] amen he said so once again we find
[1:23:27] ourselves gloring gloring in his
[1:23:30] salvation his purpose and his plan and
[1:23:32] we are confirmed even more strongly in
[1:23:35] the truth of the doctrine of the
[1:23:37] sovereignty of God why because he said
[1:23:41] as many as I love now watch this love
[1:23:45] brother BR said is elective love it is
[1:23:49] love for his elect it goes beyond even
[1:23:52] parental love we'll explain that in a
[1:23:54] moment but it's elective love oh my and
[1:23:58] and his his children there is a
[1:24:01] difference in us and God we we make an
[1:24:03] unconditional Covenant with our children
[1:24:05] we I love them unconditionally and yet
[1:24:07] there's some things we can't perform in
[1:24:09] their lives right but God makes an
[1:24:12] unconditional Covenant right and there's
[1:24:15] nothing Hallelujah that he can't
[1:24:19] perform oh
[1:24:21] Church oh it just makes me want to
[1:24:23] worship him for a while makes me want I
[1:24:26] know we get kind of Stuffy sometimes we
[1:24:28] get kind of cold we getet in our ways we
[1:24:30] just want to go on but let's think about
[1:24:32] what we're saying for a
[1:24:35] minute that God loves us so much that he
[1:24:39] will not allow us to not be what he
[1:24:42] wants us to be he will not allow Abraham
[1:24:45] not to be the father of the faith he
[1:24:48] will not allow you not to be the RO
[1:24:50] Church Oh my he loves you so much
[1:24:54] Hallelujah and he can do it where me as
[1:24:57] a father I might not be able to my wife
[1:24:59] as a mother may not be able to but he
[1:25:01] can do
[1:25:02] it amen so it's not a helpless
[1:25:05] unconditional love but it's an active
[1:25:08] unconditional love are you with me now
[1:25:11] it's elective love it's his love for his
[1:25:13] elect and his love for them is apart
[1:25:15] from Human Merit for it says that the
[1:25:17] purpose of God stands in election which
[1:25:20] is exactly opposite to works or anything
[1:25:23] man has in himself he goes on he said
[1:25:26] now he says to his own and me as many as
[1:25:28] I love I rebuke and chasen to rebuke is
[1:25:30] to reprove to reprove is to expose with
[1:25:33] a view to correction chasing does not
[1:25:35] mean to punish it means to discipline
[1:25:37] because the subject's amendment is in
[1:25:38] mind he said I love and I chased and and
[1:25:41] again he says he HED in love a family of
[1:25:44] his own sir oh this is
[1:25:47] wonderful can can we just give it five
[1:25:49] more minutes of attention I know it's

[1:26:11] Sons Sons like
[1:26:13] himself there before him lies all
[1:26:17] mankind as one lump of clay oh my out of
[1:26:21] that same lump he will now make vessels
[1:26:23] unto honor and unto dishonor the
[1:26:26] choosing will be his own choosing he
[1:26:28] said then those chosen ones born of his
[1:26:31] spirit will be
[1:26:33] trained to conform to His Image in their
[1:26:40] walk this is a god with a strong
[1:26:43] will he's not weak he's not doy right

[1:26:54] children are going to be oh
[1:26:57] Church oh what kind of attitude ought we
[1:26:59] to have towards the promises of God if
[1:27:02] he has that kind of will towards
[1:27:05] us oh my look he said then he said he
[1:27:09] said this the choosing be his own
[1:27:11] choosing they are trained to conform to
[1:27:13] His Image in their walk he reproves with
[1:27:15] all longsuffering and gentleness and
[1:27:19] mercy he
[1:27:20] chastens with nail scarred hands isn't
[1:27:24] that
[1:27:26] beautiful if the hand given you the
[1:27:28] weapon come on Church come on how could
[1:27:32] we ever complain about the discipline of
[1:27:34] God on our lives when the hand doing the
[1:27:38] spanking it's got nail scars in
[1:27:41] it see you might question your Father's
[1:27:44] Love or your mother's love but you could
[1:27:45] never question his
[1:27:47] love he died for you he spread those
[1:27:49] hands and got nail scars in it he chases
[1:27:52] you with nail scarred hands
[1:27:55] you know that he loves
[1:27:57] you amen I think that's important even
[1:28:00] with fathers and mothers we our kids
[1:28:02] we've got to rebuke them we've got to
[1:28:04] chase them but they got to know that we
[1:28:05] love
[1:28:07] them he chases with nail scarred hands
[1:28:10] sometimes this Potter must take the
[1:28:12] vessel he is working on and thoroughly
[1:28:14] break it down in order that he may
[1:28:17] rebuild it exactly as he desires it but
[1:28:20] it is love that is his love another way
[1:28:24] of his love there is not there
[1:28:26] cannot
[1:28:28] be oh I love him for
[1:28:31] that he chose all that lump of clay and
[1:28:33] in there I was there and I was chosen
[1:28:37] you were chosen as a vessel of Honor you
[1:28:39] didn't do anything to deserve that he
[1:28:42] just wanted a family just like you had a
[1:28:45] right to have a family he has a right to
[1:28:47] have a family an unconditional Covenant
[1:28:51] founded on overwhelming
[1:28:54] love I
[1:28:57] will now watch what he says in closing I
[1:29:01] will you didn't say I will if you will I
[1:29:04] I might maybe if it works
[1:29:08] out the Lord willing he was the
[1:29:12] Lord what' he say I will I will make of
[1:29:19] thee amen what's he doing to you Church
[1:29:23] what's he doing when he chases you
[1:29:24] what's he doing when when he puts you in
[1:29:26] the furnace what's he doing he said I'm
[1:29:30] making you something I'm going to make
[1:29:32] of you a great
[1:29:35] nation I Will Bless thee make thy name
[1:29:38] Great Thou shalt be a blessing I will
[1:29:41] bless them that bless thee and curse him
[1:29:44] that curseth thee and in thee shall all
[1:29:47] families of the
[1:29:48] earth be blessed as musicians come this
[1:29:52] afternoon the the the most difficult
[1:29:55] thing about being a father I think and I
[1:29:58] haven't quite reached that age but my
[1:30:00] kids are reaching that age but I can see
[1:30:01] it is not being able to control actions
[1:30:05] and your children and I'm sure a mother
[1:30:06] feels much the same way that when your
[1:30:09] children begin to do things you have no
[1:30:10] control over it I got good kids I'm not
[1:30:13] talking about my own children but but
[1:30:15] yet you see that you realize that's
[1:30:17] coming that they're going to be
[1:30:20] adults and you lose that ability to say
[1:30:22] I will
[1:30:25] yeah at one time you had that ability
[1:30:27] I'll make you go to
[1:30:29] church right I
[1:30:32] will because they were
[1:30:35] children I will make you it's hard to
[1:30:37] see them become adults isn't
[1:30:38] it hard to see them take that
[1:30:41] step because we're losing that ability
[1:30:43] to say I
[1:30:44] will right and there's a trans
[1:30:46] transition time in there before they're
[1:30:49] full you know before they're
[1:30:51] grown where they still make they make a
[1:30:53] lot of stupid decisions but you can't
[1:30:55] really beat them over the head with
[1:30:57] it right because if you do you
[1:30:59] discourage them and and and they're
[1:31:01] going to just be ready to leave as soon
[1:31:02] as they turn 18 so brother BR said
[1:31:04] that's when they need a buddy
[1:31:06] right so
[1:31:09] then you can't just beat them up with
[1:31:11] that but you lost that ability to say I
[1:31:14] will even though I want to do that so
[1:31:17] bad I will make you I will make
[1:31:21] something out of you but God never lost
[1:31:23] that
[1:31:24] ability with his
[1:31:27] children and when Paul writes Abraham's
[1:31:30] biography under inspiration of the Holy
[1:31:32] Ghost we read it at the beginning yes
[1:31:35] sir he never mentions any of the
[1:31:39] mistakes I told you about
[1:31:41] tonight not
[1:31:44] one because he said I
[1:31:47] will hallelujah how did he do it on the
[1:31:51] cross he made a way
[1:31:54] sir he said I will all right glory to
[1:31:58] God I don't know what sometimes I don't
[1:32:01] know how we sit here and just he just
[1:32:04] overwhelms us with his love how can we
[1:32:06] sit just take that I guess we'll wait
[1:32:09] till the meeting and rejoice but you
[1:32:11] know we ought to Rejoice right now right
[1:32:13] today because he said I will and he
[1:32:18] did you see his reputation was at stake
[1:32:22] in Abraham's life
[1:32:24] that would be that would be a a mark on
[1:32:26] his reputation if one sin was counted
[1:32:29] against
[1:32:30] Abraham the father of faith it would be
[1:32:32] a mark against the reputation of
[1:32:36] Jehovah he was not disappointed in
[1:32:39] Abraham in the end he will never be
[1:32:42] disappointed in his children get that
[1:32:44] out of your mind you say well I've just
[1:32:46] been a disappointment to God he will
[1:32:48] never be disappointed in one of his
[1:32:51] elect he said I will make a you a great
[1:32:54] nation ain't going to let you go through
[1:32:56] some things but he's not embarrassed by
[1:32:59] you he he's not he he doesn't he he
[1:33:02] doesn't kind of step back when you come
[1:33:04] around say well I wish he wasn't my son
[1:33:05] no he said I will I know what I'm going
[1:33:07] to make of them he sends the tutor down
[1:33:09] our way and if we don't do right he'll
[1:33:11] chasen us he'll he'll put us through
[1:33:12] some things he'll allow us to go through
[1:33:14] many things but he will not be
[1:33:16] disappointed in the end result of Our
[1:33:18] Lives he will not in the end be one bit
[1:33:22] disappointed but will be just like
[1:33:24] Abraham's life he'll say they never made
[1:33:26] a mistake they were a perfect virtuous
[1:33:29] bride never did it in the first
[1:33:32] place
[1:33:34] Hallelujah you see if he could lose you
[1:33:36] he wouldn't be God he'd be a man like
[1:33:42] me his reputation is at stake you and we
[1:33:46] will fulfill every one of his attributes
[1:33:49] that he had in his mind before the
[1:33:50] foundation of the earth we ought to take
[1:33:52] comfort and rest in that it ought to
[1:33:54] Thrill us do something for us to think
[1:33:57] that way Heavenly
[1:33:58] Father Lord as we bow our heads before
[1:34:02] you Lord I I'm just overwhelmed by your
[1:34:06] love
[1:34:07] today I just feel like I could sit by
[1:34:09] myself and
[1:34:11] cry CU I think about my own
[1:34:14] mistakes Lord and I think each one of us
[1:34:17] could Lord we sit there we think oh God
[1:34:20] why do we have to do that why didn't we
[1:34:22] learn quicker
[1:34:24] [Music]

[1:34:30] will I will make of you great
[1:34:33] nation I will have a bride at the end

[1:34:46] able because of your will we will be
[1:34:49] that bride without spot or wrinkle and I
[1:34:51] believe we are now by the the washing of
[1:34:54] the water of the word you see us through
[1:34:57] the blood you made a way you said I will
[1:35:00] to Abraham and his Seed where the
