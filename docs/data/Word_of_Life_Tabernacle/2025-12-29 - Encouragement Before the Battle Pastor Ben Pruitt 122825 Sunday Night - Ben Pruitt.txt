And continue standing with me as we open up the word tonight. And just so good to have each and every one of you with us. Remember Wednesday night, Brother Jason Jackson will be with us. We will have some refreshments after the service. We won't we won't be here all night. It won't be a regular watch night service unless brother Jason preaches that long. If he preaches that long, we'll the Dale is shaking his head no back there. But but uh I don't think we're in any danger of that. But uh so y'all will be able to go home if you want to or stay in fellowship. And we're looking forward to that Wednesday night. Amen. Do you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; You glad to be in the house of the Lord? 1st Samuel chapter 30 and verse 6. 1st Samuel 36 30 and6 says, "And David was greatly distressed, for the people spake of stoning him. I think I'd be distressed, too, because the soul of all the people was grieved. Every man for his sons and for his daughters, but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God." Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this evening. David's situation was drastic. He had gone run from Saul and put out of his own country, run into the country of the Philistines and and the of course he's in a foreign nation. His men that went with him are in a foreign country. They're outcasts, outlaws in their own country. Yet they believed that he would be king. So they put up with the suffering and the worry and the struggle and being away from home because they really believed. I wonder how many here tonight believe that our king is coming. &gt;&gt; Do you really believe he's going to be king? &gt;&gt; The son of David's going to sit on the throne &gt;&gt; during the millennium. We believe that. We believe now he's on the throne of our hearts. But they really believe that. And so they they follow David out into this wilderness place to a little city called Ziglag. And and when they come to this place, then they're off with the Philistines trying to fight with them. The Philistines won't even accept them. And the Philistines run them out of town. And when you get rejected by the Philistines, you really feel bad, you know. And so even even the world didn't want them. They found themselves going home &gt;&gt; to the temporary home that they had made in Ziglag. And when they did, they found that there was nobody there. The city had been burnt. You can imagine them coming up over the hill as they're looking forward to coming home to see their wife or the children. &gt;&gt; And they come up over the hill and they look and the city's been burnt. &gt;&gt; The walls are torn down. and and their their you can imagine the fear that must have come over their hearts. &gt;&gt; Where's our children? Where's our families? They didn't know the Lord had kept their families and their children. None of them had had died, hadn't been killed, but they didn't know that. &gt;&gt; They didn't know what happened to them. They just knew they were missing. And they knew somebody had come and and destroyed the city. Their wives were gone. Their children were gone. They had lost everything &gt;&gt; and they reached such a desperation. The Bible said they wept until they couldn't weep anymore. Have you ever been in that place? You ever been in a place where it felt like, "I've just wept so much I can't weep anymore. I don't have any tears left. My I'm dried up as as David said, like a pot shirt." He said, "I I just don't have anything left to weep with." And and that's the way that they were. They just didn't have anything more to give. &gt;&gt; And in that situation, they began to blame David as people do. They blame leadership or we blame sometimes the Lord because of the situation that we're in. And and they blame David and and David, you know, there's lots of things he could have done. He could have looked down on them, criticized them, and what kind of followers are you and you guys aren't loyal? But that's not what David did. The Bible said when they got ready to stone him, they were literally picking up rocks to stone David. But David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. I want us to look at this as we're ending the old year and we're coming to the new year. I want us to look at this and recognize that there's been many things that have happened this year. But I think no matter what's happened or how hard of a situation that 25 2025 was, as we're entering a new year, I believe that no matter what situation we're in or how hard it's been or how difficult it might be right now, you can encourage yourself in the LORD BECAUSE HE'S NOT JUST DAVID'S GOD. He's your God tonight. HE DON'T JUST BELONG TO THE PREACHERS. HE DON'T JUST BELONG. COME ON, CHURCH. HE DON'T JUST BELONG to a prophet, BUT HE'S MY GOD TODAY. DAVID'S GOD IS MY GOD. IF DAVID ENCOURAGED HIMSELF IN THE LORD HIS GOD, I CAN ENCOURAGE myself in the Lord God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This word encourage means to to grow or to make strong, to prevail, to show courage, to seize or to grasp, to keep a hold of. In in the original, if you run it back to the original Hebrew, it means to strengthen yourself, to heal yourself, to replace or repair the missing part. And sometimes we go through things and we don't realize there's something missing. There's something actually lacking in our faith because of the situations of life that we've been through and we don't even recognize it many times. But that's the time when we need to encourage oursel in the Lord is in that moment when we've gone through a struggle. We've gone through a trial. Some of y'all may not KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, BUT I THINK MOST OF US CAN RELATE BECAUSE WE GO THROUGH THINGS. We live in a IN A IN BODIES OF HUMILIATION. WE LIVE IN A WORLD THAT'S GONE CRAZY. We live in Satan's Eden. AND THE WHOLE WORLD'S GONE GONE CRAZY. And we live in we have to live in that. WE FEEL THE PRESSURE of the age. and and you realize that that THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING AS YOU GO OUT IN THE WORLD and you you rub shoulders with the world, there's got to be something to repair YOU, TO RESTORE YOU, TO BRING YOU BACK, TO REPLACE THE MISSING PART. I pray that that would be happen tonight. That if there's something missing from 2025, THAT YOU WOULD GRAB A HOLD OF THAT AND ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD BY STRENGTHENING that missing part. &gt;&gt; David had to encourage himself because a battle was coming. It's hard to fight when you're discouraged. &gt;&gt; See, a battle was coming BECAUSE THE ENEMY HAD TAKEN WHAT was his and he had to take it back. &gt;&gt; It wasn't optional. He couldn't just sit back say, "Well, the enemy stole my my wife. It's too bad. Kind of liked her, but I guess I'll go find another one." &gt;&gt; Well, the enemy took my children. Too bad. I guess I'm still young enough to have some more. &gt;&gt; He couldn't say as we say many times, well, my healing's gone, but you know, it just it just what happens to people like me, or my joy is gone, but you know, it's that kind of an age and just what happens. Or my peace is gone, but it just, you know, everybody's kind of nervous now. And no, he didn't have that. It wasn't optional. It's not optional for us either. If God has given us something, WE NEED TO FIGHT that battle. WE NEED TO FIGHT IT TILL THE DEPRESSION'S GONE. FIGHT IT TILL THE WORY'S GONE. FIGHT IT TILL THE ANXIETYY'S GONE. Young people, ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? DON'T GIVE IN TO A SPIRIT of fear. DON'T GIVE IN TO A SPIRIT OF UNBELIEF. YOU FIGHT EVERY THE THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH UNTIL THE TIME comes that YOU OVERCOME. TILL THE BATTLE'S WON. WHEN DO YOU QUIT FIGHTING? WHEN YOU GET BACK WHAT THE DEVIL STOLE FROM YOU. FIGHT UNTIL THEN. DAVID KNEW A FIGHT WAS COMING. AND IF THERE WAS A FIGHT COMING, HE NEEDED TO RESTORE HIS faith &gt;&gt; before the battle. It's not an optional thing. You don't go to war without first fixing what's wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Everybody wants to go to war, BUT YOU DON'T GO TO WAR &gt;&gt; unless you're ready. &gt;&gt; What when do you fix it? You fix it right here today as we're entering a new year. Fix what's broken because a fight is coming. If you're not as on fire for the Lord as you've ever been. If you're NOT IF YOU JUST DON'T FEEL THAT PRESENCE OF GOD IN YOUR HEART LIKE YOU used to. If if you WERE ONCE CLOSER TO GOD THAN YOU ARE NOW, NOW'S THE TIME TO TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD TO RESTORE THAT MISSING PART. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Encourage yourself, David. Fix what's broken. Oh, if I could just &gt;&gt; if I could preach it to myself tonight, &gt;&gt; if I could preach it to pastors, to ministers, to deacons, to trustees, to the people OF THE CHURCH, ENCOURAGE yourself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; IF YOU FIND YOURSELF SHYING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE OF GOD, NOT AS FAITHFUL AS YOU ONCE WERE, ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD. &gt;&gt; IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DOING THINGS THAT YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY HAVE DONE, AND MAKING EXCUSES for the things THAT YOU'RE DOING, ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD. It wasn't optional. It's not optional today. Our our families aren't optional. &gt;&gt; We can't take them or leave them. We're not. They said, "Well, they may go out in the world. They may not." No, it's not optional. &gt;&gt; We're going to keep our families. &gt;&gt; We're going to keep our joy. We're going to keep our peace. We're going to keep our Come on, Brother Ryan. We're going to keep everything that that belongs to us. &gt;&gt; We're going to keep it. And how are we going to keep it? We're going to fight for it. &gt;&gt; How we going to fight for it? We're going to encourage oursel in the Lord until we go out and fight. &gt;&gt; Come on. Some people stay so discouraged and and stay so carnal in the in their walk THAT THEY CAN'T FIGHT SPIRITUAL BATTLES. &gt;&gt; But you got to encourage yourself in the Lord to fight a spiritual BATTLE. SEE, WE DON'T FIGHT BATTLES against flesh and blood. We fight a spiritual battle with faith. In 1 Thessalonians 3:7, Paul's talking to the Thessalonian church. He said, "Therefore, brethren, we are we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith." He said, "For now we live if you stand fast in the Lord." He said, "For what thanks CAN WE RENDER TO GOD AGAIN FOR YOU for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith." To encourage yourself in the Lord is to perfect what is lacking in your faith. IT'S NOT JUST TO HYPE YOURSELF UP, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IT'S NOT JUST TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL GOOD, but if there's something missing in your faith, encourage yourself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and so this is something that that Paul wants to do for the people. Brother Random always tried to encourage the faith of the people. He talks to I'm going to read a couple of quotes where brother Brandham talks to a person who's blind. &gt;&gt; I can't think of a much more difficult situation than to not be able to see. That's right. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham is talking to a blind woman who comes up before him. He said, "Sometimes we just accept things, church. We don't need to just accept it. &gt;&gt; We need to ask God to heal us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this little woman didn't just accept blindness. She said, "I believe there's a healer." &gt;&gt; So she comes up before a prophet and he said, "This poor little mother standing here, he's praying." He said, "She's blind. Lord, you know her. I'm just a man. I've tried to represent you. Push back the blackness for her. Will you, Lord, break forth sight in these blinded eyes. &gt;&gt; I pray the Lord would do that tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "We don't ask for miracles, Lord, BUT JUST SOMETHING TO encourage her." So, Brother Brandham, recognizing the battle that's coming to this blind woman in her faith, HE SAID, "GIVE her something to encourage her so she'll BE ABLE TO FIGHT THIS FIGHT." SO, we don't always get miracles. Many times God heals us. It's over time, JT. And and and we need a little glimpse of the supernatural. OH, CHURCH, WE CAN OPEN UP OUR BLINDED EYES. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO FIGHT TO HAVE GOOD SERVICES. WE DON'T NEED JUST MAIL IN CHURCH. WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. FIGHT FOR GOD TO BE IN OUR MIDST. WHY? BECAUSE WE NEED A LITTLE GLIMPSE [snorts] &gt;&gt; OF SUPERNATURAL TO GIVE US COURAGE TO KEEP BELIEVING. ONE DAY OUR BODIES ARE GOING TO BE NEW. ONE DAY THERE THERE'S going to be Come on, THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW BODY. THERE'S GOING TO BE A CHANGE OF BODY. BUT UNTIL THAT DAY HAPPENS, LET ME CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SUPERNATURAL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Let her know that you're the son of God and I be your servant, Lord, to tell them the truth. I believe if you'd do it, Lord, everyone in here would accept you." Right? Then, please do. He said, "I want you hear my prayer. I ask you with all my heart in Jesus name." Then he speaks to the devil. He said, "Now, Satan, this duel of faith, you claim her and I claim her for Jesus. I claim that you have no power over her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER NOTHING. &gt;&gt; He said, "JESUS CHRIST, MY LORD, STRIPPED and robbed you of everything. You've had every legal rights at Calvary." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I STAND HERE AS HIS REPRESENTATIVE AND YOU KNOW HE'S ON THE PLATFORM. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS GIFT. I love that. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know all ABOUT THIS GIFT." THE DEVIL KNEW THAT THAT GIFT was from God. &gt;&gt; He knew it never failed. He he said, "I I YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS GIFT. YOU KNOW ABOUT WHERE HE MINISTERED AND HOW he did it." Hallelujah. He's talking to the devil. He said, "I charge you BY THE LIVING GOD. YOU COME OUT OF the woman. Leave her in Jesus Christ's name." He said, "Every head bowed. Let me see your eyes first." He said, "I'll call you if something happens." He said, "Now just raise your head. Can you see me? Put your hands on my nose." He said, "Amen. Open your eyes. The woman can see. &gt;&gt; She's got her sight." Brother Brandham explains that a little bit more when he prays for another woman. See the woman was healed. But brother Brandham explains that there was a battle coming after her healing. Now brother, he said, "Now keep your head bowed just a moment. I'm not asking that this has to be done for a sign, but I'm asking that Christ will just do a little something here to encourage her." He said, "A blind person always seems to be oh so tore up or something, just sitting in a dark world." He said, "NOW EVERYBODY JUST BE SILENTLY AND IN PRAYER WITH YOUR HEADS BOUND." He said, "Now, as you have your eyes over the lids, lids over your eyeballs, now hold that way just a moment." He said, "Now I want you to look directly at me in Christ's name. Can you see me?" You can see me. Wonderful. Touch my nose. Well, bless the Lord. Open your eyes, everybody. She can see. The Lord has healed her. He said, "Just touch my nose, lady." Amen. He said, "Let's just say because if she was able to touch his nose, she was able to see his nose, right? Can you?" He said, "Let's just say, "Praise the Lord." He said, "Can you show us lights right here?" The lady said, "Yes, the light." All right. Why she count them. Just go to counting down and show me. Just go on with your fingers saying like pointing to them so they can see. Can you imagine the faith that's building in this woman as she's beginning to see and she's able to touch his nose and she's able to begin to see the lights and she counts them. One 2 3 4. It wasn't just FOR THE AUDIENCE, BUT IT WAS for her. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. She begins to count the lights. And and and she begins to do that. And he said, "Just go along with your fingers and pointing to them." Yes. There. And there and there and there. Let's just say, "Praise the Lord." He said, "What happened?" God bless you, mother. Go right off the platform rejoicing. What? She's walking by herself. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's say, praise the Lord." Somebody led her up there. &gt;&gt; But she walked back by herself. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's bow our heads now and thank him. Heavenly Father, we thank thee tonight. Thou dost restore sight to the blind. And now, Lord, we realize this little woman, may these eyes continually. Brother Brandham, he's a prophet. He's he's got maturity. He understands, you know, a lot of us, we we'd see that and we'd run all over the building. Well, praise God, she's it's a miracle. And brother Brandham recognizes the devil's going to fight this woman. So, what does he say? He said, he said, "May these eyes continually as that spirit left and sight be to creep into her eyes again, it elated her, Lord, it made her happy as it would." &gt;&gt; He said, "It makes us happy." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "I pray that it'll it'll continue to grow in her sight, in her eyes, until she's perfectly normal again." He said, "I ask in Jesus name and thank you for what you've done." Now, Brother Ram goes on to explain. He talked about how that he said if I put a transparent band around your nerves, he said it would it would it would uh keep the blood flow from going to your eyes and he said it would cause blindness. Said the same thing with a man that couldn't speak. &gt;&gt; Said it would he said and that devil he said got around those nerves right and and and crushed them together and made it where they the blood couldn't flow. And then he says this. He said, "Now what it is, the Bible says it's a blind spirit." He said, "How many knows that?" The Bible says it's a death spirit, a dumb spirit. Is that right? He said, "Well, the spirit has cut off the circulation." He said, "Reme." Now, remove that. So, if you remove the band or the spirit, &gt;&gt; he said, "Of course, it'll be sore a little bit, but circulation starts back." &gt;&gt; If nature's not hindered, &gt;&gt; it'll work perfect. See, so many times what we're looking for is a miracle when really what we need is just for nature to be able to work, &gt;&gt; right? But that spirit's got to come off first, &gt;&gt; are you with me now? &gt;&gt; That's the same way a person suffering with depression or anxiety or anything like that, that spirit needs to leave so your body CAN HEAL, &gt;&gt; SO YOUR MIND CAN HEAL. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it happens instantly, but many times it's a healing. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES TIME. DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR HEALING because it didn't HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY. ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "Let her see a little supernatural. It'll encourage her." So, she was able to see. But now, watch. He said, "When the he said, remove that. It'll be sore a little bit, but circulation starts back. If nature's not hindered, it'll work perfect." He said, and and he said, "The devil hinders nature. When it does, there it is. Then move the cause. The cure is sure." He said, "Now, when the blind spirit went out, she could see. That's all. If she'll keep believing, if she'll keep believing, someone say it with me tonight. Keep believing. &gt;&gt; If she'll keep believing, in about 24 hours, she'll be seeing better all the time. &gt;&gt; THEN ABOUT 72 HOURS, SHE MAY GO TOTALLY BLIND AGAIN. &gt;&gt; And we would look at that many times as a as a failure in healing, but that's not what it is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; THE BODY'S GOT TO HEAL ITSELF. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD SO THAT YOUR MIND CAN BE HEALED, SO YOUR BODY CAN BE HEALED. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; He said, "Then after that, if she'll just keep on believing, then it'll start coming back and be normal again." All right? If she just believed, don't doubt, but have faith. He said the same thing about cancer. Many times a cancer would die, the spirit would die, and the cancer would fall off, get on the bloodstream, make the person sick. They'd think they weren't healed, and the spirit would come back on them. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's not biblical." It is. Jesus healed two blind men like that. One of them, it said he he he spit in the ground. He made clay, put it on his eyes, and and he said, "Can you see?" And the man said, "I see tree men like trees walking." Right? It didn't happen all at once, but the second touch restored his sight. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, that we could be encouraged by the first touch that WE GET THAT THE SECOND TOUCH WILL be a complete and total healing. Do you believe he can do that for you tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. David got desperate for this kind of encouragement. He said, "I'm just going to encourage myself." SEE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE PASTOR CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. SOMETIMES THE CHURCH CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE ALL ALONE AND EVERYBODY'S ABOUT TO STONE YOU, you need to encourage yourself in the Lord. I NEED TO ENCOURAGE myself in the Lord. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. HE SAID, "THERE'S SOME HERE, LORD, that even holds this token that I spoke of. They have possessed that token and yet they're sick." How many could say you've had sickness in your body, &gt;&gt; right? At some point in your life &gt;&gt; and and at during that time, like if you've GOT THE HOLY GHOST, YOU'VE HAD THE HOLY GHOST AND been sick, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost is what you need to get rid of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you have the token. So, YEAH, YOU'RE SICK. HE SAID, I WANT TO SPEAK TONIGHT on giving them courage TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO TAKE THAT GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; THEY have a right to defeat that devil. He's already defeated. He's just bluffing them. He said, "I'm claiming them, Father. Preach with me tonight, church. I I I'm I'm giving everything I got. So, you just hang with me." He said, "Now, HELP ME TO SPEAK THE WORD. YOU SPEAK through me, Lord, WITH THIS FEW NOTES I GOT WROTE DOWN HERE AND A LITTLE SCRIPTURES WROTE OUT. I PRAY YOU'LL HELP ME, LORD. Get in the word and give them faith for the glory of God." He preached that in the message called desperations. &gt;&gt; He preached a token and then he preached desperations. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said because even even Holy Ghost fililled people need to get desperate to encourage themselves in the Lord. &gt;&gt; How did David encourage himself? We're told how he did it in 1st Samuel 37. David said to Abiar the priest, aim son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiar brought hither the ephod to David. And David inquired at the Lord, saying, shall I pursue after this troop? Shall I overtake them? And he answered him, "Pursue, for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover." What does it say there? Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Bring me the ephod." Now, why would he have him bring him the ephod? Because the ephod I know you've heard this before, but just just bear with me for a moment. The ephod was a garment worn by the priest which was used to determine God's will. Because on the ephod was the urum and thumbum, &gt;&gt; right? The yurum and the thumbum. It was the breastplate of Aaron. &gt;&gt; Exodus 28:30, thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment. The yurum and the thumbum. They shall be upon Aaron's heart. I like that. The yum and thumb is the word. And the word is supposed to be on the heart of the minister. &gt;&gt; They shall be upon Aaron's heart. And when he goeth in before the Lord, Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually. So it was this yurum and thumbum that would say that would tell whether a prophecy was true or not. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Because if it was according to if it was right if a prophet prophesied or a dreamer told a dream there would be a supernatural light that would flash across the room and thumbum &gt;&gt; and brother that the meaning of that is lights and perfections. That's what yurum thumbum means. So, brother Brandon says the German thumb was it was the breastplate, the ephod that Aaron wore. It was always God always has been a supernatural God answering in supernatural ways. And when a prophet prophesied, so see when David called for that, he was calling for the word of a prophet and he wanted to make sure that the ephod WAS THERE SO HE WOULD KNOW IF THE PROPHET WAS TELLING the truth, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Right? Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A WORD PROPHET SPEAKS THE WORD. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, he makes the statement only a prophet can only be vindicated by the word. &gt;&gt; Even though we have vindications of the pillar of fire and all these things that happen, but yet those are word vindications. It's vindication found in the word that was supposed to happen in this day. Actually, what v what vindicates brother Brandham is the word of God. The word itself vindicates the prophet. HE SAID, "BEHOLD, I'LL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE COMING OF THE great and dreadful day of the Lord. He shall turn the hearts of the children back to THE FATHERS." HE SENT ELIJAH. HE DID WHAT HE SAID HE would do. AND THE WORD BECAME the vindication. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? THE SUPERNATURAL LIGHT FLASHED ACROSS THE GERMAN THUMBUM. When a prophet prophesied and them mystic lights didn't come across that year and thumbum, he was wrong. When a dreamer told a dream, if it didn't flash on that yman thumbum, I don't care how good it sounded, he was wrong. &gt;&gt; I smiled because I had a dream last night. &gt;&gt; I told some of the brothers, but I'm not sure this was spiritual at all. Uh, Brother Jeremy's outright at the moment. It's probably a good thing. I dreamed that he sung a special. Brother [snorts] Jeremy and Sister Rebecca sang a special. I can tell you what you're saying, too. You know, I'm not sure that's prophecy. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; But but see when the that dreams got would have to in the Old Testament would have to be shown when when I told it it'd have to flash across the German thumbum or they couldn't accept it. &gt;&gt; Right? Because some dreams come from eating too much. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said that &gt;&gt; some dreams come from eating too much. He said but but uh some people are spiritual dreamers. But when a prophet prophesied, when a person dreamed a dream, it had to flash on the German thumb. He said, "I don't care how good it sounded." It was wrong. He said, "I DON'T CARE JUST EXACTLY HOW MANY DOCTOR'S DEGREES YOU GOT, HOW BIG YOUR ORGANIZATION IS. WHEN YOU PROPHESY OR PREACH, if it ain't according to this word, you're wrong, brother. This is God's THUMB." SO, DAVID SAID, "I'M GOING TO ENCOURAGE MYSELF IN THE LORD BY BRINGING THE WORD, THE VINDICATED WORD, TO ME SO I can see what's real and what's not. AND I WANT TO SEE, ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO AFTER THE AMALACHITES? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND GOD SAID, "GO AND RECOVER ALL." &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, the older ironic ironic priesthood is done away with, but we've still got a yer and thumbum." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "THIS IS THE REVELATION OF Jesus Christ reveals him in this word." How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; This is God's German thumbum. Listen, what did David do? He encouraged himself with the light and perfection. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. &gt;&gt; You want TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF, OPEN UP THE LIGHT and the perfection. &gt;&gt; And see if God won't vindicate it in your life. &gt;&gt; The light and listen, your ideas, and that's why it's so important WE DON'T MAKE OUR IDEAS SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; We may have an idea about something, but that's not the scripture. That's not the word of God. BUT IF IT COME FROM THE WORD, it's the yurum and thumbum. And it'll work in your life. It'll work in your family. Everybody can tell you how to get along. Everybody can TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE YOUR MARRIAGE WORK. EVERYBODY CAN TELL YOU HOW TO HOW to discipline your kids. BUT IF IT COME FROM THE WORD, IT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Are you with ME NOW? &gt;&gt; ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN WHAT YOU KNOW TO BE THE TRUTH. YES, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Because the world's GOING TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THAT THAT despair is the truth and depression IS THE TRUTH AND UNGODLINESS IS THE TRUTH AND AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE A BOY OR A GIRL. BUT COME BACK TO THE WORD AND ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE URUM AND THE &gt;&gt; THUMBUM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The word vindicated David's present course of action. I WANT TO CHALLENGE US TODAY AS WE GO INTO 2026. DOES THE WORD VINDICATE OUR PRESENT COURSE OF ACTION. BROTHER BEN, WHY DO YOU PREACH? BECAUSE THE WORD VINDICATES MY PRESENT COURSE OF ACTION. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HE SAID, "PREACH THE WORD. Be instant in season, out of season. Reprove, REBUKE WITH ALL LONGSUFFERING AND DOCTRINE. SO THAT'S WHAT I GOT TO DO. WHY? The light flashed across the urum and the thumb. A WORD PROPHET COME AND SAID, PREACHER, HE SAID, GET OUT IN THE IN GET YOU A PULPIT AND PREACH. SO I'M GOING TO PREACH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, IF YOU'RE A PREACHER, YOU PREACH YOUR MESSAGE. IF YOU'RE NOT A PREACHER, HE SAID, DON'T TRY TO PREACH. YOU LIVE YOUR MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Live your gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO THE WORD VINDICATES OUR PRESENT COURSE OF ACTION. SO, we should examine ourselves and it will encourage us when we recognize, yeah, the thing that I'm DOING IS ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I mean, if you're sitting there, no one here's thinking like this, but if a man's sitting there, it's like, I'm going to leave my family. I'm gonna go out and divorce my wife and marry another. Does the word vindicate your present course of action? Someone say, "Well, I'm going to I'm just going to give up. I'm gonna quit going to church. Them people are a bunch of hypocrites anyway." Does the word &gt;&gt; vindicate your present course of action? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; David's about to fight a battle and he needs to encourage himself in the Lord. Does the word vindicate what I'm about to do? Does the word say that this is what I should do? His wife and children have been taken by the Amalachites. Now, remember who Amalecch was. Exodus 17:14, the Lord said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, rehearse it in the years of Joshua, I WILL UTTERLY PUT OUT the remembrance of Amalecch from under heaven." So, there are some nations that God has a he has a a bigger uh problem with than others &gt;&gt; in the scripture. You realize that there's some nations that, you know, they kind of lived alongside them and things, but there's some he said, "I want you to make sure you do away with them." &gt;&gt; He said, "WHEN YOU MEET THEM, GET RID OF THEM. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; There's some things WE CAN'T MAKE A partnership with. &gt;&gt; We can't cut a deal with. &gt;&gt; So, as we enter the new year, let's look at it and see the things that I have in my life. Are they marked OUT FOR DESTRUCTION OR are they marked out for my good? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And if it's marked out for destruction, cigarettes are marked out for destruction. Prophet of God said, "I don't see how you can make I don't see how you can make a a rapture smoking cigarettes. I want to go in the rapture." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Lust is marked out for destruction. &gt;&gt; UNGODLY LIVING IS MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? SELFISHNESS IS MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION. [laughter] &gt;&gt; DEPRESSION IS MARKED out for destruction. GOD SAID, "GET RID OF IT. DON'T DON'T DON'T SIT ON IT. DON'T DON'T DON'T MESS WITH IT. DON'T DON'T BABY IT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN SOMETHING'S ALREADY MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION IN THE WORD AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN MY LIFE, THEN THAT OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE YOU IN THE LORD. WHEN YOU HEAR THAT PREACHED, IT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE. YOU SAY, "LORD, I KNOW I'VE LOST THE BATTLE IN 2025, BUT I'M GOING TO WIN IT IN 2026. THIS THING THAT'S MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION IN MY LIFE WILL BE DESTROYED." &gt;&gt; OH, come on, CHURCH. THAT DEPRESSION WILL BE DESTROYED. THAT UNGODLINESS WILL BE DESTROYED. THAT EVIL SPEAKING WILL BE DESTROYED. ALL THAT GOSSIP AND NONSENSE IN MY LIFE, IT'S GOING TO BE DESTROYED BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] The Lord said, "I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalecch from under heaven." Verse 15, Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovani. Jehovani. For he said, "Because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalecch from generation to generation." Amalecch was an evil nation. Numbers 24 and 20, it says, "When he looked on Amalecch, he took up his parable." I believe this is Balam's prophecy. He said, "Amalecch was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall shall be that he perish forever." Deuteronomy 25:17. Remember what Amalecch did unto thee by the way. When you were come forth out of Egypt, how he met thee by the way, and smoked the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee. When thou was faint and weary, he feared not God. Now look, don't don't you realize, aren't you tired of getting taken advantage of by the devil? &gt;&gt; Now, come on. It's turning a new year. We don't turn a new leaf, but but we we do want to we do want to make the mark the time and say, you know what? I'm done with the devil always attacking me at my weakest. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to GO FORWARD AND ATTACK THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; I'm ready TO DO SOME SOME FIGHTING THAT'S NOT ME RUNNING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IF I'M RUNNING, LET ME RUN FORWARD &gt;&gt; LIKE DAVID DID TO ME GOLIATH. &gt;&gt; And he SAID HE FEARED NOT GOD. HE HE JUST TOOK THE DO TOOK YOU AT YOUR WORST AT YOUR WORST MOMENT. Your worst YOUR WORST MOMENT. AND HE ACTUALLY CAUSED YOU TO HE CAUSED YOU the the weary to be defeated, the little children to be defeated. &gt;&gt; Verse 19, therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God has given thee rest from all THINE ENEMIES ROUNDABOUT IN THE land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, THOU SHALT BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALECCH FROM UNDER HEAVEN. IF THAT THING DESTROYED YOUR LIFE, IF IT BOTHERED YOU THAT MUCH, LET 2026 be a year that is completely destroyed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't play with it. &gt;&gt; Kids get suicidal thoughts and things. Don't play with that. &gt;&gt; Not just kids. &gt;&gt; You dwell on your own misery. And devil's favorite part is a pity party. &gt;&gt; It's his favorite thing to attend. He just sits back there and drinks his tea, you know, with his little drinks his tea, sticks out his finger and says, "You know, I'm enjoying this." Quit letting him enjoy your life. &gt;&gt; You can't make peace with Amalecch. &gt;&gt; Amalecch's got to be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, come on. I don't preach like this very often, but we need to deal with it tonight. &gt;&gt; Amalecch needs to be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "When the Lord has given thee rest, thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalecch from under heaven." But the Brandham says this, you go find it on time for the quote. He said, "Any little thing that disagrees with the word is a baby Amalachite." &gt;&gt; A lot of things marked out for destruction. &gt;&gt; Any little thing that disagrees with the word is a baby Amalachite. &gt;&gt; Remember, Saul failed to get rid of the Amalachites. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And the kingdom was taken away from him over it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He he he didn't deal with it. And he said, "I I've done what the Lord commanded." And Samuel said, "What's this bleeding of sheep that I hear? &gt;&gt; How come I hear the things that you spared? &gt;&gt; Why do I see the evidence of it in your life?" And Saul failed to do it and the kingdom was taken away from him. But the reason DAVID HAD TO DEAL WITH IT IS BECAUSE SAUL DIDN'T. So I'll say this, IF FOR NO OTHER REASON, LET'S DEAL WITH IT NOW SO OUR CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT LATER. &gt;&gt; THOSE THINGS THAT ARE MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION, LET'S GET RID of them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; David encouraged himself in the Lord to take back what belonged to him and to destroy an enemy already marked with destruction. We can be encouraged in 2026 to do the same thing. Oh my. THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION, we would win that battle and we WOULD OVERCOME AND TAKE BACK WHAT the devil stole from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brown said, regardless of how little we are, how low WE ARE, HOW IMPURE WE ARE, HOW UNHOLY WE ARE, LISTEN to me. We we need to just cut off that legalistic spirit right now. You say, "Well, I'm not I'm too impure. I'm too unholy. I I can't take hold of THE PROMISES OF GOD." THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED TO TAKE HOLD of the promises OF GOD. SO, YOU WON'T BE IMPURE ANYMORE. YOU WON'T BE UNHOLY ANYMORE. IF YOU EVER NEEDED TO BELIEVE, IT'S AT THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU FELT THE WORST. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter HOW IMPURE WE ARE, HOW UNHOLY WE ARE, HOW SICK WE ARE, HOW AFFLICTED WE ARE, THE LAW OF GOD'S SPIRIT BY HIS WORD MAKES it obey him, forces the issue, and says, give it back." &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder how MANY OF US COULD SAY, "GIVE IT BACK." If you've LOST YOUR JOY IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD, SATAN, I'M TAKING IT BACK FROM YOU. IF YOU'VE LOST YOUR ABILITY TO RAISE YOUR HAND AND WORSHIP, LISTEN TO ME. YOU SING SONGS IN THE HOUSE OF GOD THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE WORD, AND WE'RE AFRAID TO RAISE OUR HAND IN WORSHIP. WE OUGHT TO TAKE OUR JOY BACK FROM THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS HOW LITTLE WE ARE. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE SITTING HERE TODAY, IF YOU'RE WATCHING ONLINE, HOWEVER YOU'RE HERE IN THIS SERVICE, WHY DON'T YOU GO GET IT BACK TODAY? Go force THE ISSUE. HE SAID, "OH, IF WE COULD JUST THINK OF THAT FOR A MINUTE, IT FORCES it regardless of conditions." No matter what the condition is, the law of God's word forces THE CONDITION TO COPE WITH HIS WORD. OH MY, THE HERMAN THUMBAM SAID THAT DEPRESSION WAS MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION. THEN LET ME DESTROY DEPRESSION IN my life. &gt;&gt; Take joy back from the enemy. &gt;&gt; It's just one thing, but there's many things. &gt;&gt; I used to love the word. Now I could care less whether I hear it. Take back your love for the word. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Take it back from CNN and Fox News. &gt;&gt; Take back your love from the for the word, from entertainment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Till I love to hear your word again. LORD, LET ME GET DESPERATE AND ENCOURAGE MYSELF IN THE LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He said, "The promise is yours, but if you ever get it, you ain't going to get it easy. I'm going to tell you that. You're going to have to take it away from Satan. Satan captures your health. You got a right to go to Satan and say, "Give it back. Hand it over. I come in the name of the Lord, the possessor of heavens and earth. I'm his heir. Give it back. &gt;&gt; Oh, a lot of us can can think about this. You took my child. You got her mixed up with the wrong boy. You took my boy and mixed her up with the wrong girl. I claim them. &gt;&gt; That's right. I claim MY CHILDREN. I CLAIM MY BROTHER. I CLAIM my sister. Yes, Satan. YOU TOOK THEM FROM GOD'S HOUSE. COACH THEM OUT THERE, BUT I'M COMING AFTER THEM. I CLAIM THEM. &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW? HE SAID, I'M AN HEIR OF ALL THINGS. AMEN. It's given to me. I'm an heir. I CAN CLAIM EVERYTHING that God promised me. There you are. It's mine. HOW DO YOU GET IT? SOMETHING YOU DONE? NO SIR. It's the unmmerited gift that God GAVE US AND IT'S OURS. It belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SATAN CANNOT HOLD IT IF YOU GO TO HIM IN the scriptural authoritative word with faith to say, "It is mine. Lay it down." Amen. Glory. I like that. He said, "Satan, YOU LAY IT DOWN. YOU TOOK IT FROM ME. YOU GIVE IT BACK BECAUSE I'M SERVING notice on you. I've got the notice written right HERE ON THE WORD. HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY, but this notice shall not." &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to keep your gun trained on that old devil. &gt;&gt; Some intruder come in your house. Some of y'all would shoot first and ask ask questions later, but man, I got a 20 gauge sitting at my door, right? Like I'm not if a guy comes and he starts to take something that belongs to me, I probably won't shoot him, but I'll make him think I'm going to. Well, it got quiet cuz the pastor's advocating violence. If you had some somebody come on your property, break in your house, and steal something worth 10 cents, you'd be mad as get out. You'd be so upset he took somewhere 10 cents from your property. You do something about it. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE DEVIL COME IN, STEAL JOY OUT OF YOUR HEART, STEAL THINGS AWAY FROM YOUR MIND, AND YOU JUST SIT THERE AND SAY, "WELL, it's just the way it has to be." &gt;&gt; No, it isn't. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LIVING YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN A LAWLESS SOCIETY. YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO BOUNDARIES. YOU'RE LIVING UNDER THE THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD OF GOD. GO BACK AND TAKE WHAT GOD HAS WAS GIVEN YOU. Take your rights in the Lord. KEEP THAT GUN TRAINED RIGHT ON THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we, well, he didn't drop it when I told him to, so I want to give up. No, keep your gun trained on him. &gt;&gt; Shoot him if you have to. &gt;&gt; Make him real uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, I can have what I said. He said that gets him started. He said, don't get him started. gets him running. Lay it down cuz I have come with scriptural authority. I am a believer. I believe the lights have flashed on the German thumb. I'mum a vindicated prophet in our day has said, "Go take it back." I believe we ought to agree with that today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a couple of ways we gain courage before I close tonight. We gain courage through the preaching of the word. Deuteronomy chapter 20 and verse one says, "When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and see horses and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them, for the Lord thy God IS WITH THEE, WHICH BROUGHT THEE UP out of the land of Egypt. And it shall BE WHEN YOU COME NIGH TO THE BATTLE." SO RIGHT BEFORE the battle starts, oh my. He said, "LET THAT THE PRIESTS SHALL APPROACH AND SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE AND SHALL SAY UNTO THEM HERE, O ISRAEL, YOU APPROACH THIS DAY UNTO BATTLE AGAINST YOUR ENEMIES." LISTEN, WE'RE NOT PROMISING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EASY. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT PROMISING THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE any easier than last year. It might be harder, &gt;&gt; BUT I KNOW THIS. YOU HAVE A GREAT GOD. YOU HAVE A GOD THAT IF YOU'LL SURRENDER TO HIM AND GIVE INTO HIM, YOU CAN WIN EVERY BATTLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HEY, look at this. He said he he said the PRIEST SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM. LET NOT YOUR HEARTS FAINT. FEAR NOT. DO NOT TREMBLE, NEITHER BE YOU terrified because of them. For the Lord your God is he that goeth WITH YOU TO FIGHT FOR YOU AGAINST YOUR ENEMIES TO save you. Oh, I believe there's some preachers today that are doing that. I believe there's some pastors, some evangelists, SOME SOME GODLY MEN ALL OVER THE LAND THAT ARE that are coming BEFORE THE BATTLE AND TELLING YOU, "YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. IT'S YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME. THE BATTLE MIGHT GET HOT AND HEAVY, BROTHER WEST, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH IT." [snorts] &gt;&gt; We gain courage through singing. Did you know that? That's why congregational singing means everybody sings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Testing one, two, as the brothers say. I'm not very good on my catchphrases. &gt;&gt; Congregational singing is called that for a reason. &gt;&gt; You may you say, "Well, I'm not a good singer." But the devil needs to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; And you need to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to hear yourself say, "I am not alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; y'all bore with me tonight on that song. I just threw that on the kids. But you know what? I needed to hear myself say it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to hear yourself say it. YOU MAY NOT BE MUCH OF A SINGER. I'M NOT MUCH OF A SINGER, BUT LET ME WORSHIP THE LORD, BROTHER STEWART. I AM NOT ALONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We gain courage through that. 2 CHRONICLES 20:22 IT SAYS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO SING AND TO PRAISE THE LORD SET AMBUSHMENTS against the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir which were coming against Judah and THEY WERE SMITTEN. WHAT WAS IT? THEY BEGIN TO BE ENCOURAGED AND THE LORD BE TO FIGHT THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; OH CHURCH, WE DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE WHAT WORSHIP MIGHT BE DO MIGHT DO for us. &gt;&gt; Listen what Paul what brother Brandham says. He said you know singing gives courage. You know that don't you? The soldiers WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BATTLE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO? THEY PLAY MUSIC AND SING AND things to give them courage. AND WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BATTLE, WE SING. IT GIVES US COURAGE TO GO ON. I TELL YOU WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO IN THE NEW YEAR. YOU OUGHT TO GET READY FOR THE BATTLE BY SINGING TO THE LORD. SING OUT A NEW song to the Lord. SING A SONG THAT THAT THAT LETS HIM KNOW that he's worthy. Amen. HALLELUJAH. SING A SONG THAT'LL ENCOURAGE YOU IN THE LORD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Encourage the people. Singing gives courage. And when we're going to battle, we sing. It gives us courage. Go on. musicians, go ahead and come. We're going to put the word in action tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, we're not limited. I I love when when Brother Joel's here, you know, he sings for us a lot. We're going to sing tonight. We love Brother Joel, don't we? I really miss him when he's gone. But let's sing tonight. LET'S ENCOURAGE OURSELVES. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS RELY ON A SONG LEADER. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS RELY ON SOME EVANGELIST SOMEWHERE. YOU GOT TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY EPHESIANS 5:19, "SPEAK TO YOURSELVES IN PSALMS AND HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS, SINGING AND MAKING MELODY in your heart to the Lord." Colossians 3:16, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another." How do you do it? In psalms and hymns AND SPIRITUAL SONGS. DO YOU REALIZE WHEN YOU SING DURING CONGREGATIONAL SINGING, even if your voice is bad, but maybe your wife needed to hear you sing? Hallelujah. MAYBE YOUR MAYBE YOUR CHILDREN NEEDED to hear it. Maybe you needed to hear it. I'm not alone. I'm going to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Brother JT, I appreciate you being in the house of the Lord today. We just lost Sister Clelet this week, but we are not alone. She's in a better place than we are. It's time to encourage ourselves in the Lord. We got a little battle left. HER BATTLE'S OVER. WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME LEFT TO FIGHT. LET'S FIGHT IT WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT. Let's fight the battle, church. 2026. ENCOURAGE YOURSELF FOR THE BATTLE. GET OUT THE LIGHT AND PERFECTION. PREACH THE WORD. Sing the word. Live the word. Encourage yourself in the Lord. Let's stand together. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, we come to you in worship. Oh, come on, church. No matter what the serend.

As you worship the Lord, let the chains fall off of you tonight. You said, "That can't happen, BROTHER BEN. I KNOW IT CAN HAPPEN. I'VE SEEN it happen. It's happened to me." Oh, so I'll throw up my hand. Glory. Raise you again and again. Oh, [music] cuz all that I have is a hand. Oh, hallelujah. And I know it's not much. I'm nothing else fit for a king.

DAVID'S standing there and the people are literally picking up rocks to stone him. They were sure talking about it. He was in the worst moment of his life. HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN. HE'D LOST EVERYTHING. HE HAD NO CLUE HOW TO GET THEM BACK. BUT HE INQUIRED OF THE LORD. AND THE LORD SAID, "GO AND TAKE IT." WE HAVE INQUIRED OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR TONIGHT. AND A VINDICATED PROPHET SAID, "GO AND TAKE IT." AND WE SEE IT IN THE WORD. THEN WHY DON'T WE DO LIKE DAVID DID?
