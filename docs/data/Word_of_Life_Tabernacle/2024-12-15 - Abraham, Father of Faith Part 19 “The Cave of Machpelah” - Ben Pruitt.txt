now in Jesus name amen amen thank the Lord just enjoying the song service so much it's good to be in the house of the Lord on a Sunday morning Genesis CH 23 and verse 19 Genesis 2319 this will wrap up Lord willing wrap up our series on Abraham we didn't get to everything but I just felt that maybe this morning we'd Clos the loop on this and and we'll revisit Abraham again I'm sure in the future if the Lord terries but I trust it's been a blessing to you Abraham always been a blessing to me because you know when all else fails just believe when things don't look like they're going right and everything's everything's messed up and nothing's right and it feels like you maybe you're getting old and your body's hurting just believe right because if you believe God's word it's his responsibility to bring it to pass aren't you glad for that it's not my responsibility to make it happen it's not yours it's on him that's the way Abraham lived said Lord it's on you I'm so glad that we can do that as well Genesis 23 and9 and after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave the field of MPA before mamry the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the sons of Heth pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated we'll have our our Christmas service I'll preach my Christmas sermon next weekend the Lord willing so if you have family or anything that's going to be in town you sure be welcome to come as they always are we know Abraham was a nomad he was a sourer he never owned a home in the land that belonged to him he never tried to build a city he never tried to uh build a house he lived in tents the Bible says by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles or tents with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked so this is why he acted the way that he did he didn't tie himself down too much for the bill because he looked for something he looked for a city which has foundations whose Builder and maker is God that word looked for is expected he expected he he was expecting waiting with eager expectation I wonder if you could say that this morning I'm wait waiting with eager expectation looking for a city that this world has has not seen yet and so he was waiting for a city he looked at the Unseen and and when Romans 8:18 Paul tells us to do the same thing he said I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in in us he said for the earnest expectation of the the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God that word waiteth is the same word looked for it's expects that's what we're waiting that's what we're expecting we're expecting the manifestation of the sons of God what was he looking for he was looking specifically for a city with foundations and the Bible tells us that other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ looked for a city in other words that was built by God because Abraham understood that anything built by man can be shaken down anything built by man is temporal anything if you own a vehicle you know that everything no matter how well it's made and how good it smells and how good it looks when it comes off the lot over time it's going to deteriorate is that right over time if you own a home the home is going to fall apart all you have to do is just let it go you don't even have to do anything nothing bad has to happen to it just not fix it and over time it'll deteriorate and it'll fall apart why it's built by man but Abraham looked for a city that was built by God himself oh I'm so glad that we have that kind of a city today that's built by God he said I want a place a home I want some place that I can go to are you with me this morning I want someplace I can go that's got a foundation to it when all the world shakes apart and nothing's going right for me and my my whole world it seems like nothing is is right but yet he said I know there is a city with a sure Foundation he look for that kind of a city and we know that man cities have always been built and laid out and planned by human beings starting with Cain in Genesis 4:17 it says he builded a city and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch and we know that's a type of denomination how know that that's why we are not a denomination because we're not looking for a temporal Kingdom we're not looking we're not building a kingdom we're not building a temporal City and so we're not looking for that we're looking for something Supernatural something something more real than reality come on Church something more real than this world that we're living in something more real than our our sickness there something more real than the pain that we experience so something more real than that amen and Abraham recognizes that and if you ever catch a glimpse of that it'll change your life Abraham recognized that the cities that he had been a part of like er the caldes like Sodom and Gomorrah were built by the effort of man with no sure Foundation because the Bible tells us that everything that can be shaken will be shaken this nation will be shaken and has been Shen shaken and is being shaken we we know that the world around us is falling apart we know that the weather is acting crazy and politics is acting crazy and people are acting crazy but in these times we need to look up and realize what and see what Abraham saw and see it's a city made by God without hands amen so what do you see he saw something that can't be can't be shaken loose and so this morning I want to exort you and encourage you I want you to understand that you got to look Beyond brick and mortar you got to look beyond your job you got to look beyond your house you got to look beyond your car let me see a city with foundations let me see something worth striving for listen if there's something in this world that's worth working for it ought to be the gospel I realize we can't work our way into salvation but if there's something worth doing these things for if there's something worth putting our whole effort into brother Caleb it ought to be the word of God right because that's the city without that that's the way he builds is by the word of God we we know that City's there because of the word of God so there's something worth striving for it's that City see we we get what we expect right you wouldn't invest in it unless you expected a return and you won't make much of an investment if you the more the more cautious you are about the return or the more unsure you are about to return the less investment you make but Abraham put all his uh what is that all his eggs in one basket right he said Lord I believe your word I believe I've been promised to land I've been promised a son and I'm looking for a city so he put all his eggs in one basket he said I'm going to do everything that God requires me to do so we get what we expect and so that's how we endure Affliction patiently because all of us will suffer Affliction all of us will go through things and we know that it affects us it affects our attitude it affects but we we've got to make sure that we put that City first and understand that if we're looking at that City no matter what happens here that there's something better coming in 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our I love the way he frames this light affliction our light Affliction which is but for a moment I love the way Paul puts that he said it's it's light it's it's nothing in comparison and it's momentary it's it's it's you say well I've been going through this for a long time but it's just a bliff on the radar in comparison to what's coming it worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory he said while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal so we need to you know we live in an age of Television we live in an age of internet where we can see things we can we can visualize so our our our imagination is shaped by sight right and and I don't know if any of you have ever listened to oldtime radio or you you ever listened to radio back in the day but back in the day you you got to imagine what it was like right right you got to imagine and I I heard many stories on Unshackled growing up one of my favorite memories is listening to Unshackled on Christian radio growing up because we didn't have a television and so we listen to the radio and I'm and it and it caused me to my imagination you know I could I could build that in whatever way that I wanted to we live in a in a time where you don't really see it then it do didn't happen but but you got to recognize that there's got to be something that you that you can grabb a hold of that you can perceive that you can you you can understand Beyond it's got to be words Beyond sight right because no matter I can put a diagram up here I could show you what the city will be like I could show you what heaven will be like but I it would be wrong that's right right it might be technically right but it wouldn't be the experience of it it wouldn't share the joy of it it wouldn't brother BR said no no words can even describe it even even in that Dimension where he was at in that sixth Dimension he said no there wasn't a word to describe it he says Beyond Sublime no words in the English dictionary so it's got to be something that you can see in your mind if we can say by the mind of the spirit something that you can visualize something you can see beyond what this world is in you've got to be able to see a body that doesn't suffer you've got to be able to see a a place where it's perfect you got to be able to see a place where you could fit in a place where it'll never be awkward anymore a place where there'll never be any any social stigma anymore a place where we're in the majority you realize we've never been in the majority the whole time we've been alive and we've been we were OD ducts when we were young and when we get older we realize why we were Christian we were God we had a seat of God in us and God awakened that seat we got filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the world thought well this is an odd duck this is somebody that doesn't fit in we've never fit in down here neither did Abraham he lived his life that way he didn't fit in but we're going to a place you got to be able to see by the eyes of faith and see a place where you don't where you will fit in that's why we do what we do right because our actions are influenced by this other place look Paul says why we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal with the things which are not seen or Eternal for we know that if our Earthly house house at 2 Corinthians 51 we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens now watch what he's saying if this tent so you say well Abraham lived in a tent I've got a house but this is a temporary house right a temporary house it is a a tent Paul SS our Earthly House of this tent were dissolved we have a building so look at the contrast not a tent but a building not something that rots something that can rip something that can tear you ever stayed in a tent at night yeah a lot of you have you went camping right you go camping in a tent maybe all rich people got RVs but we always did tent camping we we we camped in tents and I remember one time I took Britney and it was just us you know and we're going to go camping we went up by somewhere miles out from Ava Missouri out in the middle of nowhere and there's no lights and there's no and we're not we're not really uh we're not really nature people we we're uh City people in a lot of ways I was born I was raised on the farm but we didn't go camping for fun you know it's not something you would necessarily do but only a few times but I said we're to go camping we went way out in the middle I'll never forget all night long she asked me she said what's that noise we're in the middle of nowhere she said why why why are they making that noise it's the Forest right not to pick up my wife and she I was up all night long we have never done that again we've camped since but only in campsites where there's people nearby but we were 10 miles from nothing out there around Ava Missour beautiful place beautiful country but we were way away from anything listen that's what it's like camping in this tent right you hear things you don't understand you experience things that that seem gloomy to you in dark but remember the sun's coming up and we have a building we have a house to go back to oh I'm so thankful that when this temporary camping trip is over I got a place to go to I got a home made by God Amen made with eternal material something that'll oh Church make ought to make a shout this morning something that never Decay something that can never fall apart Hallelujah Abraham's actions were influenced by this house not made with hands Eternal in heaven so God had revealed to Abraham there's a city and there's a house or a Tabernacle in that City for you to live in Abraham's actions were influenced by that he saw what he saw but the expectation of Faith the Hebrews 111 says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so Abraham and those after him looked for and died expecting something they never saw in life and they really didn't even understand it but they were looking for it something in them cried out for it because they were made to be a resident of that City you and I were made just like Abraham to be a resident of that City we were predestined to that place so Paul tells us in Hebrews 11 I don't have time to read it all but he tells us about Abel and Enoch and Noah and Abraham and Sarah and then he says this he said all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them that word is convinced and embraced them welcomed them right so when they were persuaded that the promises were real they were convinced of it they grabbed a hold of it they embraced it and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they' been mindful of that country from which they come out they might have had opportunity to have returned so in other words in order to reach this city you got to sell out to it in order to recognize you got to be willing to untether yourself from all of these cities and even from this house in order to reach that one oh church this robe of Flesh has to drop in order for us to go to a different one a new home he said they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is a Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city Oh my he talks about Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and Moses and Rahab and he says what shall I more say for the time would fail to tell me of Gideon and Barack and of Samson and of jeffa of David and Samuel of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword look what they did and how they acted why they were looking for a city and this overarching theme and thought of their life influenced how they acted see if you just bear with me people who are overcome many times by their trials and it keeps them and they say well I just can't go to church I I can't serve God because this happened or that happened they just haven't got a vision yet right because no matter what you've gone through and I understand we go through things but no matter what you've gone through no matter what's happened in your life if you ever catch a hold of the vision that that that there's a better City a better place another world that's far beyond this one then your whole life begins to work towards that and you're able to do things that would seem to be impossible you're able to quench the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword are you with me out of weakness we're made strong waxed Valiant in fight he said well I'm not a fighter but when it comes to fighting the enemy I'll fight why because it's my home I'm fighting for oh how many times have as a great big nation tried to invade a smaller one and I said surely we can overcome this Army but they realized them people were fighting for their home that's why they fight like they do listen the reason we fight like we do the reason we go to church like we do the reason we live like we do is we're fighting for another city we're fighting for another home we're not just fighting on Sunday we're fighting on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday we're fighting every day of the week every hour of the day fighting for another city fighting for a better place oh Church oh if we could just tell you this morning if I can encourage you brother Bru fight for that City don't let anything get you dragged down to this one fight for a better place women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings a were over Bonds in imprisonment they were stoned they were swn aunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about and sheep skins and goat skins being DED Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided Hallelujah some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so they were held in Paradise until the coming of Christ are you with me now they without us should not be made perfect but then we realize the same thing during the church ages they were they were held they they believed and they were Bride for their age but they could not become what we become the fullness of the word why oh church we we we we receive the fullness of the word not that each one individually is that but together as the bride we are the fullness of the word what she is he what he is she is she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power and so what we are doing is God has provided a better thing for us than even the church ages that they without us should not be made perfect this is what Abraham looked for listen a city that's been revealed to us with foundations do you realize we have everything but that body that's right that's the great thing about the message of the hour I don't think we realize that I don't think we recognize what's come look what we've come to Paul told the the Old Testament Believers the Hebrews he said we've come to a better mountain right a better Mountain that'll preach right there I think Stewart preached on that one time the mountains we've come to a better Mountain than Mount Si we've come to a better place Mount Si couldn't take away your sins but Mount Calvary will but what have we come to we've come to mount Sunset what was the attraction on the mountain the fullness of the world God himself coming down again in our age to give us all that we would have need of the last sign that we would ever need was given in our age to show us something what was it for to show us that we're ready it's here all we've got to do is get a new body are you with me now that's the only thing we're waiting on and that City become a reality to us now Abraham looked for a city that ha Foundation patience a more sure word of Prophecy and all of his actions as I said were influenced by this city and prefigured it he died expecting it now brother brandham ties this to our future home and if you haven't listened to Future home in a while future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride go listen to it again it'll bless you amen he said this is the city right describing the city 1500 M Square in the shape of a pyramid and it's and people I don't know how people ever ever thought that that was around Jeffersonville by the way cuz brother Brown's very plain there's a reason why Abraham looked for the city where he did God called him into the promised land to look for that City this is the city that Abraham was looking for he said see being a prophet he knew that city was somewhere the Bible said so and he for s the city he lived and he went over look where he went exactly where it'll be exactly where it'll be amen and he said he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God see being a prophet Jesus gone to prepare with the Divine hands a Divine City a Divine architect for a Divine Boughton people for predestinated people he has gone to prepare Abraham was looking for it for what city for that City City and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose Builder maker was God he said that Prophet knowing it was somewhere right he knew it was somewhere now John sees it coming down saw it in symbol form remember but Abraham thought it must be on earth right then why he met MDC the king of it Hallelujah no wonder he was looking for a city because he actually met the king of Salem he met the king Hallelujah of Eternal peace he he met the king of the city and give him a tithe which had no father no mother he had no beginning of Life or no ending of life so having met the king Abraham decides there must be a city Hallelujah and they've never been able to find you know Scholars have looked at that and they can never find what city was they talking about what city was they talking about that mzc was king of he was king of that City he was hallelujah king of the Heavenly City and so Abraham met him and so having met him he recognized that there was a city he was going to go to and so he was not happy with cities of the earth listen to me church that's the same thing you and I got to do we've got to meet him and if you ever meet him you're looking for that City Abraham met him and they took communion right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up Hallelujah the Holy Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live think about it Church everything he did influenced by that City and everything we do influenced by that City looking at the Unseen but the B say some time ago I remember talking to an intellectual person it said how will you ever know there's anything different than just what any religion could produce that's a good question by the way how do you know that what you believe will produce anything different than any other religion would produce I said I read in the Bible of a living God I read of his goodness I read of his patience and his power and I believe that just as much as anybody could believe it but one day glory to God one day Abraham had heard about it God told him but one day he met the king of it one day I met the one I read about then there was a sudden change and I've never been the same since listen to me young people that's what's got to happen in every one of your lives there got to come a time there's a sudden change a sudden change and suddenly you're never the same you're looking for a city why you met the king of the city I've never been the same since and I hope I never will be something takes place when sight fails to produce it faith is there to catch the place and produce it Oh my he talks about Abraham and he said he got a glimpse of the Unseen by faith he saw it and the Bible says that he endured seeing the invisible god with him all along the road listen when a man once catches that Vision do you have the vision this morning have you caught the vision when once a man catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking right so before he met the king he's in out up down didn't know really know what he believed wasn't really sure where he belonged right but when he met the king of the city Hallelujah and caught the vision yes sir he endured seeing the invisible god with him all along the road and when he when he catches that it brought stability to his thinking it stabilizes his actions right so when you see instability what needs to happen many times out of our instability I got to be careful here but many times what we're trying to do is our instability when we got instability in our home now listen to me it matters when we got instability in our home we we see that chaos and we want to order the chaos if that makes sense we try to stack this here I'm talking mentally now in our in our mind we put this here and this here and this here and we say well if he would do this and she would do that but the gospel doesn't call us to that it might be a good mental exercise to clear your mind but the gospel is not the reordering of your thoughts it's the stabilizing of your thoughts because the enemy is always going to be able to come in but what is the gospel there for the enemy comes in and says you're sick you're going to die but the gospel says I'm the god that heals all your diseases and you met the king of the city see you know the city is real so you believe the word that comes out of from the King right and so it stabilizes your thoughts and your actions so it stabilizes when you when you think well you know my husband doesn't love me or my wife doesn't love me I think I'll just go leave them and go get another one but this church what happens when you see see you you don't need just to be reordered you need to see what Abraham saw you need to see there's another life beyond this one so let me order My Life by the word let me love my wife like Christ loved the church let me obey my husband and honor my husband like God said to do why why why am I doing that not because they acted different or the preacher acted different but because I've my my thinking has been stabilized right I go to church because my thinking has been stabilized are you with me now I believe the word because my I don't get too high or too low because my thinking has been stabilized by catching the vision of an invisible God and in the time of distress and trouble he said it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening older people get really good at this because they have to right I'm going to preach I'm going to give a little our elders we ought to we to thank God for our elders they've gotten really good at looking at another city because they have to right because there's not much in this body when you as you get older to be proud of now come on right that's right used to you could maybe lift so much and walk so far and and do so much and look so pretty but as age comes on you you got less and less in this body to be proud of so I know there's some people that just desperately try to keep that alive so you get Hollywood actresses that look like they're well if you see them from a distance they look like they're 16 and you get closer and realize they're not Hollywood actresses and southern gospel singers y'all know what I'm talking about they paint their face and they get all you know nice and pretty and you get real close you realize they've they've aged what's happening they're trying to keep that alive but there's got to be a time as you get older and I think most of our elders have settled into this that you realize hey this world can't be it there's got to be something better I see pain every day I go through trials every day sometimes I struggle to get up and go sometimes I can't remember what I want to remember but remember he's still there with you what's he doing he just pulling the feathers out of the nest he got to make us uncomfortable enough that we want to go home he's calling us to a better City we were never called to live in West Plains we were never called to live in kosanam we were never called to live in Hardy we were never called to live in in wherever it is that you live in Jonesboro we weren't called to that City we were called to the New Jerusalem a city not made with hands we were called to look at the Unseen as you get you begin to recognize that you begin to see there's something more something more valuable all if our young people could only catch a glimpse of that there something more than this life there's something more you think well if I could ever get that boy to speak to me if I could ever get that girl to talk to me don't you realize there's something more than that that might be good but how much more is it to get the king to talk to you he's looking at the Unseen in the time of distress and trouble make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise and the reason he believed it was because God said it and if we being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and if the spirit that was in Christ dwells in US it does the same thing it takes every Divine promise of God that's in his Bible I love this calls it present tense Hallelujah and rest itself upon there he said where if you look at with your eyes and you see now that our nation is shaking and trembling amen we could say Amen to that today as it was in in the 50s and the 60s it is today War clouds are flying everywhere uh Russia just put a a a nuclear uh uh a uh satellite into space that has to do with nuclear weapons we've got drones flying around everywhere I'm it's going to be really funny if that turns out to be some kind of high school prank but but what nobody knows what it is and the government won't tell us what it is our government lies to us for our own good every day that's just a fact things we don't need to know they say right we live in that kind of world but we've always it's always been that kind kind of world but it keeps getting worse and worse in this nation as they get farther and farther away from God but he said every sign that Jesus said would happen is happening there would be signs in the heavens above and in the earth below and great things would be taking place like flying saucers and Mystic things taking place but he commanded his church to lift up their heads list to be church we are not to put our heads down but to lift up our heads in that day and to look up for the Unseen Christ will be appearing pretty soon so if we only walked by sight we would be Children Of Darkness sure enough now but I'm so glad to know there is a light that shines in every believer's heart until that Eternal day when Jesus shall come Hallelujah when Sarah died Abraham knew it wasn't over cuz we're going to live in that city right hallelujah we're going to live in that City we've got a home a body has been prepared so Genesis 23:1 and Sarah was 107 and20 years old 127 so sister Fritz's got a little while and brother sister Curtis have a little while to go 127 these were the years of the life of Sarah and Sarah died in Kurth arba the same as heon in the land of Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her oh my there's so much we could get into there I just don't have time today I'm just looking at one side of this but you go and and find that that's why Caleb fought for that land right give me my mountain right Hallelujah and Abraham stood up from before his dead and spake to the sons of H saying I'm a stranger and Sojourner with you give me a possession of a burying place with you that I may bury my dead out of my sight now the closest thing that we've had in in modern times in the last several hundred years to Abraham's life would be the the the ban the the bin in the desert they travel like Abraham did and they live in tents and people like Lawrence of Arabia people that went and spent time with them and lived with them said that the ban usually buried their dead in a in a simple ceremony in the place where they died so if they got killed they just buried them right there because they had no sure resting place now Abraham had never cared where he lived but he cared where they put him when he died right he Hallelujah he didn't have a place on Earth that he could call home even though God said it's all yours right he said it's all yours but Abraham didn't have a single place if you Abraham where do you live he'd say well I stay right now over such and such a place he had no place to call home but there's something in our heart that longs for home isn't there some place where we can belong but be careful that you don't get too tied to a particular place that's because nothing down here will ever really satisfy that longing so he doesn't care so much where he lives just in the promised land right but he cares the spot where he's going to bury his wife and where he will be buried so he goes to a certain particular place and he begins to negotiate he bowed down himself before the people of the land and he spake unto Ephron and the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou will give it I pray thee hear me I will give thee money for the field take it of me oh bury my dead there and so he begins to talk to them and you remember they had told him they said well just take it we we want to give it to you you're a great man a prince Among Us he said no he said I want to buy it I want to get a deed for it I don't want to contract for deed I don't want a mortgage I don't want to rent it I want a deed for it so the only property that Abraham ever owns is is a burial plot oh my a burial plot I love the fact that he got it big enough to bury him and his family in that same place and believing that they would want to return to that same place he had already been told they would be strangers in a Strange Land for 400 years so they begin to negotiate backwards kind of from free to full price in Genesis 23:14 says Ephron answered Abraham saying unto him my Lord hearken unto me the land is worth 400 sheckel of silver what is that betwix me and thee so he's still trying to get him just take it said bury therefore thy dead and Abraham hearkened to Ephron Abraham weighed he said if that's what you say it's worth he weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth of 400 shekels of silver so there was a transaction there would be no question about who owned this land hallelujah it's done publicly so there would be no question he bought it and the field of Ephron which was in MPA which was before mamory the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field I love the way the Bible describes this that were in all the borders round about were made sure and what that means is that if you got property you probably seeing a legal description now if you live in town it probably says lot one of block 10 of something something subdivision right but if you live in the country it doesn't say that it says go you know 90 degrees this direction and 89 degrees this direction and and it's really hard to follow right but the way that used to be if you look at old Deeds it wasn't done that way it was done from the big post oak tree right to the corner of the barn that's the way they did Deeds I've looked at many of them where they did that because that's what I did for a living and so we had to go way back you get back in an abstract you begin to see some of them would put it would put a piece of used farm equipment bury it in the ground and that would be the corner post right or they would go from a creek you know a a a sometimes what always uh exasperated me is when they would go from a a wet weather Creek right cuz that Creek may not even exist before long cuz the it's only there when it rains if it quits raining you got trouble so that that causes all kinds of conflict so what but what they did what they would have done is they would have walked around the land and they would have made sure of all the borders of the land they would say that's why it says the the cave and the trees right they would go from one tree to another say this from this tree to that one something that would last see to over there back here and they wrote it down it was an early form of a legal description to make sure that the cave was in it and where he was going to bury Sarah so he had to make sure there was no defect in the legal description oh church that's what God did in our age he sent a prophet to take the book The Abstract clear the the title back and what did he do he brought back tied up all the loose sins made the legal there's something we had to do called making the legal description close so we had to be able to follow it around make sure that if it started here it had to come back to the same place don't you realize that's what the message of the hour does it brings us from glory to glory it brought us from the mind of God brought us all the way around through the church ages and down until we come back to the mind of God again it has to close this the Alpha and the Omega have to be the same Hallelujah we we could just Minister on that all day but I don't have time look all the trees were in the field all the borders were made sure unto Abraham for possession in the presence of the children of heav before all that went in at the Gate of his City so they put it that then instead of having a courthouse say at the gate was where all business was transacted he made sure everybody understood this the public notice Abraham owns the cave and the field of mpel now why this particular field now Abraham being a prophet always went back to what a previous Prophet said right this is important if you think someone's a prophet don't look at whether they do signs and wonders look and see if they go back to what a previous Prophet said right that's how you that's their Vindication as a prophet are they going to stay with a prophet's words the same thing with a minister or a pastor always look and make sure that the pastor is going back to what a previous Prophet said right that he knows how important it is to say what a prophet said right the way brother Brandon put it so someone you say well I respect him because of who he is you better make sure that what he's saying goes back to what brother brandom said the previous Prophet brother brandom made sure what he said went back to what Paul said the previous Pro are you with me now right Paul tied what he believed back to the Old Testament are you with me now so Abraham would have known what the previous Prophet said what job said about the resurrection in job 19:23 job what happened to job job was going through some things but he met the king of the city Hallelujah job 1923 oh that my words were not written oh that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and Leed in the rockes ever for I know that my redeemer liveth brother B said before he supposed he he guessed he thought maybe it was so but now he can say I know why he met the king Hallelujah God revealed it to him I know my redeemer liveth and he that that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself my eyes shall be holding not another though my Reigns be consumed within me Abraham would have known what job propes side he would have known about the resurrection so when it come time for Sarah to die he said let's find a place near job huh let's find a place oh Church job died in the same Land look Abraham said I've I've had the same kind of a vision this is brother Brandon talking Abraham said I've had the same kind of a vision went up yonder on the mountain when Christ God met me and give me his Redemptive names Jehovah J Jehovah RF and all those seeing the death burial and Resurrection brother BR talked about how that was typed in Isaac what did we talk about last week Jehovah Gyra why did Abraham believe he had met the king of the city he believed in a resurrection in a better City so he knew that if he put Isaac in the ground Isaac would come up out of the ground church oh he met the king of the city and so what was it he said that that he was willing to lay his life down he said knowing I received him as one from the dead I believed he would raise him up again and through this great hope that beats in my heart I know he said he could raise him up see it was a foresight of the Resurrection the same thing job had so he said now I'm a joint air with job so bury me in the same ground that's right so they took him over there took Sarah over and buried her right near job how do you know where job was buried I don't know if they had a sign up this is the burial place of job or if he just if he there's just some understanding that come to his heart I haven't found where job said where he would be buried but it was there in that land because he said bury me near job uh we could put it like this give me that same Revelation yes right he had the same Revelation job had so he buried himself in the same place he had Sarah buried in the same place then him himself and then his children he said I'm a joint air with job so bury me in the same ground so they took him over there took Sarah over and buried it right near job now it was what was it that made him buy the field right why would Abraham spend good money for something that he may not ever see again in life cuz he was a pilgrim and a stranger why would he pay good money for a burial place full price because something in his heart caused him to to do it because he had a revelation of the Resurrection brother B taught us that the resurrection in Your Heart Makes You Want To Serve God I should have preached this at Easter and not at Christmas I guess but you know he came to die so he could be raised job when he'd seen this and Abraham saw it he buried Sarah there job purchased the field bought it with his money so that it would be assured put Witnesses before it he was assured he bought this field for a burying place I'm going somewhere this morning I I won't hold you all day but I want us to really get this and then Abraham himself when he died he was buried with them in the same field Genesis 259 his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him where in the cave of mpil in the field of Ephron the son of the Zohar the hittite which is before mamry so when Jacob got through blessing his children you know know here was here was Isaac uh and he was actually buried in the same place and then Jacob gets through blessing his children in Genesis 49 we've just been through the story of Joseph and he charged them and said of them I am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the hittite so even you young people understand that you want to be buried in the cave same place right that's pretty simple there they buried he said Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac and Rebecca and there I buried Leah remember we talked about that he didn't bury Rachel there he buried Leah in the place of the Resurrection the one he didn't even want but God give him that's right right Joseph said the same thing Joseph says to his breth in Genesis 15:24 I die and God will surely visit you bring you out of this land un the land which he swear to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you shall carry my bones Hallelujah carry up my bones from it so when they come out there was a strange thing here they were coming out of Egypt with joy and rejoicing but it was also a funeral procession here they come with the bones of Joseph what was it not with sorrow but with gladness he wanted be buried in the same place said carry my bones by eyes of Faith what was it they saw the place of the resurrection and and they were looking forward to a time when Christ would come remember they would be raised from Paradise at that time all of these Patriarchs waited there until Jesus died when he died the veil was rent and the Bible says the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many brother BR dramatized that how they would kind of go around the corner and somebody might recognize them and they disappear you know travel like a thought right they they come to the city oh my now where were they coming to the sight of the future home that's right right they come to the city and when they come they looked around and said not yet it's under Roman control are you I'm just dramatized but you understand it's under Roman control everything's that it's all everything's all uh messed up here's Caesar here's his Legions here's the Jews just crucified Jesus nobody was believing nobody they said no this isn't it but there's one coming so they go into the sixth Dimension look when Jesus raised from the dead brother the B said job seen that coming he said I know my redeemer liveth the last day shall stand upon this Earth though the skin worms have destroyed this body yet in my flesh I'll see God I'll see him that quickening power coming to the grave of job where there wasn't even a spoonful of the Dust of his bones left Paul we talked about that that question that you had but listen if there's not even a spoonful of the Dust of the bones after all those hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years his bones had decayed it went back and turned back to the gases of the earth and just a mere Ash dust laid there but yet when that quickening power according to the word of God to the promise hundreds and hundreds thousands of years later when that quickening power was brought forth from the grave job Abraham Isaac Jacob all of them come out of the Grave with him glory to God what was it he was the first fruits of the resurrection and they knew that the first fruits of the Resurrection was coming out of the promised land not Egypt he said they were spirit spiritual they were prophets when Jesus died on Good Friday raised up on Easter morning the following Sunday morning the Bible said many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth raised up and come out of the graves went into the city went on into Glory with him why it was them prophets that knew exactly where to be buried at the place at the time it was hid from the eyes of the wise but they knew they looked at the Spirit side the first fruit of the Resurrection was to come out of Palestine not out of Egypt so it is today friends so many people listen hold on to things of the world or some great system or something be bury me in Jesus oh how many could say Amen to that today bury me in Jesus don't bury me in a church don't bury me in a denominational name bury me in Jesus don't bury me in some doctrinal name in this message bury me in Jesus for those that are in Christ will God bring with him in that resurrection and I don't care what the world's got to say he said how much they try to teliz things ensil I'm going to get into that maybe but later but t or later not today they try to tinsil eyesee things but talks about Christmas tinsel tinsil was something people didn't know it was shiny but it was bad for you made it out of lead they try to tinzee things it's in Christ those that are in Christ that God will bring with him the spiritual mind he said catches those spiritual things the spiritual mind catches those spiritual things look now the Bible tells us cuz we're looking for a city everybody with me so far I got a few more minutes it says Colossians 210 you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also you're circumcised with the circumcision made without hands putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism so what's he saying you don't have to be circumcised In the Flesh because you're circumcised in Christ right buried with him in baptism where and also you are risen with him remember we talked about that in Christ as the mystery of God revealed you're part of him the bride was in him when he died your sin was judged in him when he died you're risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who have raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh ha pass tense now look remember they had to raise and then they recognized this this is him right he come down and and emptied Paradise now we don't do that we go we go to the sixth Dimension we wait and then if we die or we're raptured in a moment in twinkling of an eye we're caught up together right but why did they have to do that now it had to come oh my by way of the Cross that's what B paid for their sin was the cross that's what blotted out the handwriting of ordinances against him was the cross he said well well when does that happen to us well we meet him' we are raised a pre- resurrection Resurrection we are quickened from dead trespasses and works are you with me now we are quickened by the spirit of God for what purpose for the purpose of the Resurrection that our bodies might be changed one day our souls are are awakened to that City so that our bodies one day could be awakened to that City you being dead in your sins uncircumcised he said he blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us we were driving down the road the other day and my mother was telling me not you know slow down uh put your phone down you know which is what she does when she's in the car love my mom but if it wasn't for my wife and my mother I'd just be driving in a field somewhere just just making circles and I said but Mom she said obey the law I said Mom but the the handwriting of ordinances that was against me was blotted out oh my oh I believe we ought to obey the law of this land but there was a law that was against us it was the law of God and it was blotted out I can't be judged for sin why I was in him that's why when you think when you go through something you think this is the Judgment of God on me it is not it could be his hand correcting you allowing things to come to correct you but he is not judging you he can't judge you if you're a Christian you belong to him and even the Judgment of these out here has been put off his wrath will come one day his judgment will come but right now is the time for Mercy he can't judge you he's you've already been judged in the cross Hallelujah you were in him there and you were quickened with him and the handwriting of words was blotted was blotted out which was contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it to his cross what they would do in that time when some when someone was pardoned when or or when a when a mortgage was paid they would take the the the the skin that was written on or the paper the parchment that was written on and they would blot it out and nail it in public so people could see it he said the law was blot it out where you couldn't even oh Church you couldn't even read what you did anymore he said he don't even remember it contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers made it show them hopefully triumphing over them in it what was it you were buried with him raised with him Romans 6:3 know you're not so many of us as we baptized how many of you have been baptized you've been baptized I asked that question in Egypt and everybody said oh yeah we've been baptized come to find out they were baptized as infants no we don't believe in infant baptism because the infant doesn't know what they're doing that's right right you're just giving them a bath right but it's got to be when you know what you're doing how old is that brother Ben I however old you when you know what you're doing I'll say this don't turn your kids down if they really want that and they express a sincere desire and you feel like they understand a little bit what they're doing because sometimes I was baptized at 7 and I ain't never looked back and sometimes that's what you need they're ready they're tender and I know of at least one case I don't know why I'm talking about that but I know of at least one case where a parent turned down their son being baptized and that mother come to me weeping years later and said he never has been baptized ized because I thought he wasn't good enough he wasn't living good enough to get baptized we we don't live good enough to be baptized a man come brother BR said I want to be baptized nobody will baptize me because I smoke he said I don't have nothing to do with it you're baptized to identify yourself bury yourself with him so you can lose that desire to smoke right so so he said we were baptized into Jesus we were baptized into his death so as many of us as we're baptized to Jesus we're baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him Hallelujah just like Isaac was buried with Abraham and Sarah Hallelujah we are buried with him by baptism into death like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him no we don't believe just the water does that it's just a symbol of what's taking place on the inside we're being buried our old man is dying and the new man's coming on we we are a new creature in Christ we are we are buried with him our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that his forth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin how do we do that we're baptized not just by water but by Spirit 1 Corinthians 12:13 for by one Spirit someone say one Spirit one Spirit are we all baptized into one body we're one body Church don't pick apart the body you need the body don't sit there and judge get judgmental about the body get clannish about the body we need one another every one of us need one another from the littlest to the biggest from the front to the back we need each other we are baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have all been made to drink into one Spirit brother BR said no wonder they said bury me in Palestine they knew the resurrection was going to be in Palestine therefore today brother you can have whatever you want to all the old cold formal religion you want to but bury me in Christ I don't want to cold for a religion I know people say we're Pentecostal I don't know how where they get that from people say we're Pentecostal I'd say let me be a little Pentecostal I don't want that old cold form of religion I don't want a religion that won't bring tears to your eyes I don't want a dead religion I don't want something that doesn't make you act in a certain way I want something that shows in your life not just in church but every day want something that'll that's heartfelt bury me in a place that's not cold and formal bury me in Christ for those that are in Christ will God bring with him in the resurrection bury me there say whatever you want to call it fanaticism whatever you want to do but just let me stay in him for those church let me stay oh church we just realized that today let me stay in him I you can call me you can call me oldfashioned you can say well brother Ben why do you give up try to give everything you can towards that Kingdom that's because I I know I've been buried with him I'm going raise with him call it what you want to but I'm coming up that day they can put me under the ground they can put me under six feet of dirt or a million feet of dirt it wouldn't matter coming up could burn my body I could be eaten by sharks I don't know how I rarely get on a boat but somehow it could happen they could burn us to believe whatever they wanted to do we' still come up amen for those that are in Christ will God bring with him we are buried we have a revelation of Resurrection that's what brother BR talks about he said that's what makes a mother get up in the morning and say and not say well you know today I have to take my kids to church in such a struggle he said but'll make her want to do it make her want to do it why because it's a he said it's a revelation of the Resurrection The Resurrection is in her heart oh church we need to get it back in our heart he didn't want the resurrection just in our head but the resurrection in
