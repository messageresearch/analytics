[47:43] verse 3 if you haven't kept up with the
[47:46] services about jonah you can go back to
[47:48] the previous
[47:49] two or three wednesday nights and you'll
[47:51] find the other things that we've said so
[47:53] far and we'll maybe continue if the lord
[47:55] would allow us to do that it says but
[47:58] jonah rose up to flee
[48:00] unto tarshish from the presence of the
[48:02] lord and went down to joppa
[48:05] and he found a ship going to tarshish so
[48:08] he paid the fare thereof and went down
[48:11] into it to go with them unto tarshish
[48:14] from the presence of the lord
[48:17] but the lord
[48:19] had other ideas
[48:21] i love that but the lord
[48:24] is what paul says in the new testament
[48:25] but god
[48:27] rich in mercy
[48:29] but the lord had other ideas
[48:31] the lord sent out a great wind
[48:33] into the sea
[48:35] and there was a mighty tempest in the
[48:37] sea
[48:38] so that the ship
[48:40] was like
[48:41] to be broken
[48:43] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[48:44] to the word you may be seated this
[48:46] evening
[48:48] i want to speak to you about that storm
[48:51] that jonah went through
[48:54] jonah's going to tarshish it's as far as
[48:57] you can go i think i put a map
[48:59] on the slides i don't know if you can
[49:01] read it but if you go to this side of
[49:02] the screen
[49:03] nineveh is all the way almost on this
[49:05] side of the screen jonah is coming from
[49:08] joppa the port city of joppa
[49:10] which is in israel and all the way on
[49:13] the other side that's spain over there
[49:15] that's what we would know it
[49:17] as today it was the iberian peninsula
[49:20] that somewhere around there is where
[49:22] tarshish was
[49:23] and tarshish was a place where the great
[49:26] trading ships of the day would bring
[49:29] gold and silver
[49:30] it was a three-year round-trip journey
[49:33] jonah wasn't just going
[49:35] to another town
[49:37] he was going as far as he could go
[49:40] to get away from god
[49:43] and he gets a little little ways out in
[49:45] the sea and he found out god had other
[49:47] plans
[49:49] amen we know we don't get far because he
[49:52] just gets into the boat and lays down to
[49:54] rest and sometime during the night a
[49:56] storm broke out
[49:58] oh my how many times have we tried to
[50:00] run from god and we got a little bit
[50:03] away from him and a storm broke out
[50:06] something happened to get our attention
[50:08] and to bring us back where we're
[50:09] supposed to be
[50:11] so if you look at at that map and then
[50:13] go to first kings chapter 10 and verse
[50:15] 22
[50:16] uh solomon the great king solomon had a
[50:19] had at sea a navy of tarshish with the
[50:22] navy of hiram that was the king of
[50:25] lebanon once in three years came the
[50:27] navy of tarshish bringing gold and
[50:30] silver ivory and apes and peacocks and
[50:33] they would
[50:34] they would go across the ocean there the
[50:36] great ships the largest most stable
[50:40] ships in the world and verse 27 and the
[50:42] king made silver
[50:44] to be in jerusalem as stones
[50:47] that's that's how much they could hold
[50:49] and how much they would bring that he
[50:51] actually made silver to be in jerusalem
[50:53] and stones and cedars made he to be as
[50:55] the sycamore trees that are in the veil
[50:57] for abundance the bible says even gold
[51:00] was almost worthless during solomon's
[51:02] reign because he made almost everything
[51:04] out of it
[51:05] he was very very wealthy it's the type
[51:07] of the millennium
[51:09] right that we're going to and so uh so
[51:12] here he brought all this stuff from
[51:14] tarshish so there was a great trade that
[51:16] was going on even in jonah's day he
[51:18] would have known about that now
[51:20] so again he wasn't just going away he
[51:23] was going on the biggest strongest ship
[51:25] possible going to tarshish to go to a
[51:29] place where he thought god couldn't
[51:31] force him to go to nineveh he's going
[51:33] the opposite direction and he didn't
[51:36] understand and i don't think we
[51:38] understand sometimes when we run away
[51:40] from god when we go in the opposite
[51:42] direction we're playing right into the
[51:44] hand of god yes sir
[51:46] you think about your children how
[51:48] sometimes they try to run from church
[51:50] and and they try to run for don't worry
[51:52] god's got his hand on their lives
[51:55] we we have a promised church that
[51:57] they're going to come back if they were
[51:58] raised in the fear and admonition of the
[52:00] lord if you raise them right he said in
[52:02] the end when they're old they won't
[52:04] depart from it and so we have a promise
[52:06] he's got his hand on him
[52:08] he's in charge of the water that they're
[52:10] sailing on he's in charge of the people
[52:13] at their job he's in charge of the
[52:15] country that they live in he's in charge
[52:17] of the places that they go and at the
[52:19] right time he's going to stir things up
[52:22] until they begin to come back to god
[52:24] and that's the exact place where
[52:26] joe where jonah found himself
[52:30] jonah was going to make it impossible
[52:31] for jehovah
[52:33] to force him to go to nineveh and he
[52:35] didn't understand he was right where god
[52:37] wanted him
[52:39] to be
[52:40] the bible tells us that god is in charge
[52:42] of the waters even psalms 48-7 he said
[52:46] thou breakest the ships
[52:48] of tarshish with an east wind
[52:51] so it's even in prophecy jonah would
[52:53] have sung that in the temple he would
[52:56] have known that verse he would have been
[52:57] acquainted with the psalms of david how
[53:00] that the shifts of tarsus were broken
[53:03] by the wind of god
[53:05] you should have known that you can't
[53:06] outrun god
[53:08] he would have sung psalms 139 and 7
[53:11] where david said whither shall i go from
[53:12] thy spirit or whether shall i flee from
[53:15] my presence if i ascend up in heaven
[53:17] you're there
[53:18] if i make my bed in hell behold thou art
[53:21] there
[53:22] oh my oh can we think of an omnipotent
[53:24] god tonight we think of an omnipresent
[53:27] god he said if i make my bed in hell
[53:30] thou art there if i take the wings of
[53:33] the morning and dwell in the outermost
[53:35] parts of the sea see jonah should have
[53:37] known better he should have known god if
[53:39] he wanted him to go to nineveh he was
[53:41] going to go to nineveh
[53:43] amen he said even there shall thy hand
[53:46] lead me and thy right hand shall hold me
[53:50] if i say surely the darkness shall cover
[53:52] me even the night shall be light about
[53:56] me
[53:57] oh there's nothing we can hide from him
[53:59] church we might as well surrender to his
[54:01] will we might as well go along with what
[54:04] he wants us to do we might as well
[54:06] believe his word can you say amen to
[54:07] that tonight we might as well just
[54:09] believe him because there's nothing we
[54:11] can do to alter his great plan
[54:14] amen that's why we shouldn't worry so
[54:17] much
[54:18] sometimes we try to micromanage
[54:20] everything to the point of
[54:22] we all we're doing is creating confusion
[54:24] god knows what he's doing
[54:26] he don't need us micromanaging our
[54:28] tomorrows he knows what tomorrow holds
[54:31] and jesus said it's sin to worry to be
[54:33] anxious about tomorrow sufficient to the
[54:36] day is the evil thereof
[54:38] amen it's not something we brother brown
[54:41] taught us worry is sin
[54:43] right because you you try to look
[54:45] forward and and even james said he said
[54:47] you rich man you say tomorrow we'll go
[54:49] do such and such he said you don't know
[54:50] that you'll live till tomorrow
[54:52] because life is just a vapor it's like a
[54:54] mist in the in the wind and it just goes
[54:56] it appears for a while it goes away it's
[54:59] like grass that withers
[55:01] and that that shouldn't be a horrible
[55:03] thought to us but a wonderful thought
[55:05] that god who placed me here and kept me
[55:08] all of this time is able you believe
[55:10] he's able tonight church he's able to
[55:12] continue to keep me all the way until
[55:15] the end of my life
[55:17] hey man i feel good tonight do you love
[55:19] the lord
[55:20] hey man you believe he's able to keep
[55:22] you
[55:24] hallelujah
[55:25] so he said john you know jonah knew all
[55:28] of this he said the darkness and the
[55:30] light are both alike to thee
[55:32] it was blinded by his bitterness
[55:35] so he ran from the presence of god
[55:38] but god knew that he would
[55:40] god called him for a purpose
[55:43] jonah 1 4 again says but the lord
[55:47] sent out a great wind into the sea
[55:50] there was a mighty tempest in the sea
[55:52] so that the ship was like
[55:54] to be broken they thought that they were
[55:56] lost
[55:58] you see it's many times not in the
[56:00] stillness of life but in the storms of
[56:02] life
[56:03] that jehovah shows its power that he
[56:06] manifest himself
[56:08] to us
[56:10] in psalms 107 and 23
[56:12] david speaks of the of seafaring men and
[56:16] how they would cross the sea and get in
[56:18] trouble in the storms
[56:19] he said they that go down to the sea and
[56:21] ships that do business in great waters
[56:25] they these see the works of the lord and
[56:28] his wonders in the deep
[56:30] for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy
[56:33] wind which lifteth up the waves thereof
[56:35] you know if you want to feel small be on
[56:38] the ocean when the waves are coming in
[56:41] when a storm comes up i don't even like
[56:43] to be near the ocean
[56:45] when a storm comes up
[56:46] i'm being honest with you i've been down
[56:48] on the on the gulf coast when a storm
[56:51] would come in near mobile alabama and
[56:53] when the storm come in
[56:55] i didn't even want to be anywhere near
[56:57] the coast i was anxious and and worried
[57:00] even being in a in a building close to
[57:02] it let me honest with you why because
[57:04] the sea was so powerful
[57:06] but it's it's an expression david says
[57:09] of god's power that they see the works
[57:11] of the lord because here's these mighty
[57:13] waves crashing down on them he says he
[57:16] commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind
[57:18] which lifteth up the waves thereof they
[57:20] mount up to the heaven they go down
[57:22] again to the depths their soul is melted
[57:25] because of trouble i don't think he's
[57:27] just talking about sailors here but
[57:29] we're all sailing across live sea
[57:32] and sometimes we are up and sometimes
[57:34] we're down and sometimes it feels like
[57:37] we're
[57:37] we're a run with in the wind and and the
[57:40] ship is starting to break up and our
[57:42] souls melt because of trouble but he's
[57:45] even in charge during that moment yes
[57:48] during those times of our lives
[57:51] so he said they their soul is melted
[57:53] they reel to and fro and stagger like a
[57:55] drunken man and are at their wit's end
[57:58] yes
[57:59] you know what that means it means they
[58:01] couldn't think of anything to do that
[58:03] would help their situation
[58:05] their minds could not comprehend they
[58:07] were skilled sailors but they could not
[58:09] comprehend anything that would help
[58:11] their situation but let me tell you
[58:13] tonight but the bill when you get to a
[58:14] place where the doctors can't think of
[58:16] anything that would help you when you
[58:17] get to a place where you can't think of
[58:19] anything that would help you and
[58:21] everything has failed remember he's
[58:22] still in the boat he's still in the ship
[58:24] he's still in command of the storm he's
[58:27] still with you during that moment
[58:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[58:31] forever trust god yes because he's there
[58:34] with you
[58:35] they're at their wit's end and
[58:38] and they don't know what to do he said
[58:39] then they cry unto the lord in their
[58:41] trouble and he bringeth them out of
[58:43] their distresses oh if you've been
[58:45] through very much in life if you've
[58:47] lived very long and been a christian you
[58:48] know that this is true you know god
[58:51] lifts you up out of your distresses
[58:54] you make it the storm a calm
[58:57] so that the waves thereof are still
[59:00] then are they glad because they be quiet
[59:02] so he bringeth them unto their desired
[59:05] haven
[59:07] oh my how many times could our testimony
[59:09] repeat that
[59:10] in our lives
[59:12] i think of the time when jesus calmed
[59:14] the storm
[59:16] what was he doing
[59:17] remember david said he makes the storm a
[59:20] calm
[59:21] they knew that jehovah was in charge of
[59:23] the waves
[59:25] jehovah was in charge of the storm
[59:27] so when a little man
[59:29] who was tired a man who was asleep in
[59:32] the boat
[59:33] when they woke him up and he got up and
[59:35] put his foot on the bow of the boat and
[59:37] he said peace be still and the waves
[59:39] still they said that's god
[59:42] the believer said that's god he proved
[59:44] he was more than a man he proved he was
[59:46] god
[59:48] oh i i think we ought to we ought to
[59:50] understand who he is tonight
[59:53] who's with us
[59:55] you know he's god
[59:56] if he's god he's able to to reach into
[59:59] your situation to take care of it
[1:00:03] you're trying to solve things that don't
[1:00:05] even need solved yet
[1:00:08] you're looking down the road and
[1:00:10] and trying to figure out a life that's
[1:00:12] coming i know i've been there i've done
[1:00:14] that
[1:00:16] but the older i get the more i trust
[1:00:19] because
[1:00:20] the more i realize he's been so good to
[1:00:22] me
[1:00:23] to let me be where i'm at today
[1:00:25] i mean i don't know what tomorrow holds
[1:00:27] but i know he holds it
[1:00:30] i know he's using the storm to show his
[1:00:32] glory
[1:00:34] so in in nahum one and three which
[1:00:36] interestingly is the prophet name is the
[1:00:39] prophet of judgment to nineveh that
[1:00:41] jonah thought he would be
[1:00:43] but nam is the one who actually preaches
[1:00:46] judgment to nineveh years later
[1:00:48] he said the lord is so to anger
[1:00:51] and great in power
[1:00:53] will not at all acquit the wicked
[1:00:55] he said the lord has his way
[1:00:57] in the whirlwind
[1:00:59] and in the storm do you believe that
[1:01:01] tonight he has his way
[1:01:03] in the whirlwind and in the storm do you
[1:01:05] know who you're serving do you know what
[1:01:07] deity is tonight you know what it means
[1:01:11] to say that god has these things
[1:01:13] in his control i i watched today there
[1:01:16] was a man and i saw it when it when it
[1:01:18] happened back in december you may
[1:01:20] remember there was some tornadoes that
[1:01:22] came into
[1:01:23] kentucky and there was a man there i
[1:01:25] think his name was jordan baez or
[1:01:27] something like that and bay's i believe
[1:01:29] his name was
[1:01:30] and he was there in a
[1:01:32] in his house in kentucky was blown away
[1:01:35] and his sister was recording the next
[1:01:37] morning she walked in on him all that
[1:01:39] was left was the piano for whatever
[1:01:41] reason the piano was left there and he
[1:01:43] sits there and he plays a song
[1:01:45] and there was a lot of songs maybe that
[1:01:47] he could have chosen but he later said
[1:01:49] that this had been on his heart for days
[1:01:51] and it was jesus
[1:01:53] jesus there's something about that name
[1:01:56] there's a lot of songs about storms that
[1:01:58] you could sing but it was jesus there's
[1:02:00] something about that name
[1:02:02] because he said kings and kingdoms will
[1:02:04] all pass away
[1:02:06] amen but there's something about your
[1:02:08] name
[1:02:09] oh my that's so that's where we ought to
[1:02:11] live church that's the revelation that
[1:02:13] we ought to have we ought to be able to
[1:02:14] sit in the middle of the storm in the
[1:02:16] middle of the ruins of what it looks
[1:02:18] like the the storm that's going to
[1:02:20] destroy us it's going to take away
[1:02:21] everything sit in the middle of that and
[1:02:23] say jesus there's something about your
[1:02:25] name i know you're in control of
[1:02:27] everything i know you've got this i know
[1:02:29] you're the same yesterday today and
[1:02:31] forever i know you've helped me before i
[1:02:34] know you'll help me again
[1:02:37] right amen
[1:02:39] brother branham put it this way he said
[1:02:40] don't be scared
[1:02:42] god is driving the winds
[1:02:44] do we believe that tonight
[1:02:46] god is driving the ark
[1:02:49] he has all things provided he said why
[1:02:52] noah wouldn't have had any victories if
[1:02:54] there wouldn't have been any storms and
[1:02:55] trials
[1:02:56] he said if we're just put through a
[1:02:58] little safe tunnel to run through
[1:03:00] there's no joy yes you ever thought
[1:03:02] about this he said if we're put through
[1:03:04] a little safe tunnel to run through
[1:03:05] there's no joy
[1:03:07] the storms of life is what makes us have
[1:03:10] the joy
[1:03:11] right
[1:03:12] amen the story said what did i do to
[1:03:14] deserve my life do you want joy in your
[1:03:16] life it's the storms of life it's what
[1:03:18] makes us have joy
[1:03:20] we would never know what daylight was
[1:03:22] unless we had some dark
[1:03:24] we'd never know what a hilltop was
[1:03:25] unless we had a mountain
[1:03:27] we'd never know what good health was
[1:03:29] since we had some sickness you'd never
[1:03:31] know how to enjoy salvation unless you
[1:03:34] were once a sinner i think that's the
[1:03:36] problem with some people they don't
[1:03:37] enjoy their salvation because they don't
[1:03:39] know they've ever been a sinner but if
[1:03:41] you knew you were a sinner and you can
[1:03:43] enjoy your salvation every once in a
[1:03:45] while your hand will raise and tears
[1:03:46] will go down your face and you'll make
[1:03:48] some noise in church why you were once a
[1:03:50] sinner you know what it's like yes sir
[1:03:52] you can enjoy salvation
[1:03:55] hey man you know you weren't always good
[1:03:58] are you with me tonight
[1:04:01] god has made all things
[1:04:03] the law of contrast but levi that's why
[1:04:06] every time you go to do something good
[1:04:08] satan will come up against it
[1:04:10] every time all through your life
[1:04:13] every moment of your life when you try
[1:04:15] to do something good
[1:04:16] get ready for it satan's always going to
[1:04:18] come against it and we've talked about
[1:04:20] that lately when i would do good evil is
[1:04:22] present but just remember that just
[1:04:24] means you're doing good
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:28] he said he doesn't he loves you
[1:04:31] that's why he makes all things the law
[1:04:32] of contrast he wants you to have joy he
[1:04:34] loves you
[1:04:35] he said see how we can rest upon his
[1:04:37] word then
[1:04:39] no matter how hard the storm blows
[1:04:41] oh it's just a simple thought tonight
[1:04:43] but i want you to un to get this
[1:04:45] he said what's contrary to it rest
[1:04:48] solemnly upon the word
[1:04:51] god said it
[1:04:52] who has seen the other side of the storm
[1:04:56] yes
[1:04:57] see god knew
[1:04:59] what the storm would do to the ship
[1:05:01] and what the sailors would do to jonah
[1:05:05] and what the hey man what the fish would
[1:05:07] do when he was dropped into the ocean
[1:05:09] jonah didn't know any of that
[1:05:11] right but god knew
[1:05:13] god knew what jonah would do and how he
[1:05:15] would go and preach in nineveh and how
[1:05:16] the people would repent and how they
[1:05:19] how that jonah would sit there and have
[1:05:20] bitterness in his heart and we'll get
[1:05:22] into all that if the lord is willing but
[1:05:25] god knew all of that ahead of time he
[1:05:27] knew what the storm looked like on the
[1:05:28] other side yes sir that's right and so
[1:05:31] he said rest on him rest solemnly upon
[1:05:33] the word god said it who has seen the
[1:05:35] other side of the storm if you're sick
[1:05:37] anchor your soul in the haven of rest
[1:05:40] if you're perplexed and distressed
[1:05:42] remember he said i'll be with you always
[1:05:44] even to the end of the world and he said
[1:05:46] all things someone say all things
[1:05:49] all things no exceptions
[1:05:52] work together for good to them that love
[1:05:54] the lord
[1:05:55] he said so just stay right there
[1:05:58] and when the sea is blowing and storming
[1:06:01] he said i guess maybe some of you has
[1:06:02] never been privileged to see a ship
[1:06:04] anchored
[1:06:05] he said i've rode them when they throw
[1:06:07] out a sea anchor like that until the
[1:06:09] little craft couldn't even go over the
[1:06:10] top of the wave
[1:06:12] it would go through the wave
[1:06:14] but as long as the anchor held
[1:06:16] that's all that makes any difference
[1:06:20] oh how many have your anchor cast today
[1:06:22] your anchors cast you're not going to
[1:06:24] pull up the anchor why the anchor holds
[1:06:26] to the storm
[1:06:28] well it might seem like having the
[1:06:30] anchor down is going to make you going
[1:06:32] to make you wreck but actually the
[1:06:34] anchor is what saves you
[1:06:36] he said as long as the anchor held
[1:06:38] that's all that makes any difference
[1:06:40] whether we go over it under it around it
[1:06:42] or through it it doesn't matter the
[1:06:44] anchor holes he said that's the way when
[1:06:47] storms of life begin to shake us
[1:06:50] we may have to go through we may have to
[1:06:52] go over under around but just let the
[1:06:55] anchor hold within the veil
[1:06:58] let the anchor hold within the veil to
[1:07:00] the unseen and brother madam talks about
[1:07:02] how the anchor holds someplace where you
[1:07:03] can't see it
[1:07:05] you can't see what it's anchored to
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:09] oh god if we could just realize that
[1:07:11] they say well i don't want to throw the
[1:07:12] anchor out because i can't see you know
[1:07:14] the anchor holds to something you can't
[1:07:16] see but the rocket's holding on it's a
[1:07:18] predestined rock it was predestined to
[1:07:21] be there by god himself it is the word
[1:07:23] of god
[1:07:24] he is what holds our anchor amen he is
[1:07:28] the anchor itself
[1:07:29] he said just let the anchor hold within
[1:07:31] the veil to the unseen we don't know
[1:07:33] just exactly where it's at
[1:07:35] but it's a holding
[1:07:39] and brother branham tells a story about
[1:07:40] the boy with a kite
[1:07:42] you've heard the story he said was that
[1:07:44] the kind was the stormy day
[1:07:46] he said you couldn't see the sky and the
[1:07:49] kite was so high that you couldn't see
[1:07:50] the kite
[1:07:51] and the boy's got the the kite and he's
[1:07:53] holding it like this and and a man walks
[1:07:56] by and he said son he said do you even
[1:07:58] know you have a kite on there he said
[1:08:00] how do you pray how can you prove it
[1:08:02] he said i can feel it tug
[1:08:05] that's the way it is with us and god
[1:08:07] sometimes
[1:08:09] when the storms of life obscure our
[1:08:10] vision of christ and we begin to not be
[1:08:12] able to see we can't prove that he's
[1:08:15] there we can't prove scientifically that
[1:08:17] our life is being guarded by the holy
[1:08:19] spirit but yet he's there and we know
[1:08:22] he's there because we feel the tug on
[1:08:23] wednesday night we feel the tug on
[1:08:25] sunday morning well i don't want to ever
[1:08:27] let go i don't want to ever let go and
[1:08:29] not be able to feel the tug of his of
[1:08:31] his hand i want to have a hold of
[1:08:33] something that i can feel i know it's
[1:08:35] not all about feelings but i want to
[1:08:36] know that he's tugging
[1:08:38] on the other side
[1:08:41] hey man
[1:08:42] he said
[1:08:44] he could feel the tug
[1:08:47] here there's a famous quote i know a lot
[1:08:49] of people use it but
[1:08:50] i just had to put it here
[1:08:53] he said now the stabilizers have been
[1:08:54] put on the ship
[1:08:56] great fearful waves are out here before
[1:08:59] us
[1:09:00] but we know just beyond that wave yonder
[1:09:02] we're nearing the shore
[1:09:05] hallelujah we're nearing the shore just
[1:09:07] stay stable just stay in the word stay
[1:09:10] with god
[1:09:12] no matter how you feel with anything
[1:09:14] else stay right with the word
[1:09:16] he said let it stay stable
[1:09:19] when you see all these great big old
[1:09:21] clouds around us and storms coming and
[1:09:23] atomic bombs and everything else they're
[1:09:25] talking about but our stabilizer is
[1:09:28] right straight in the word yes god said
[1:09:30] it would be here
[1:09:32] we'll crest every one of them
[1:09:34] what a positive quote and i know there's
[1:09:36] people who use this the same quote and
[1:09:39] brother random talks about the boy that
[1:09:41] didn't feel the joy that he used to he
[1:09:42] said well there's no revival anywhere
[1:09:44] and brother brown said if you're
[1:09:45] spiritual you'll understand what i'm
[1:09:47] talking about and he goes on to read
[1:09:49] this quote people use that to to bring
[1:09:51] the people down i i think this is a
[1:09:53] positive thing
[1:09:55] we know even when we don't feel any joy
[1:09:58] there's still joy there
[1:10:00] even when we don't have any any great
[1:10:02] signs and wonders yet we know and yet we
[1:10:05] know we're promised those things
[1:10:07] so we believe for those things but we
[1:10:09] don't have to have them to believe
[1:10:11] are you with me tonight
[1:10:15] if i never felt his presence again i
[1:10:17] still believe he's there
[1:10:19] i never knew i still believe but i'm so
[1:10:20] glad he lets us feel the tug every now
[1:10:22] and then
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:25] he said our stabilizer is right straight
[1:10:27] in the word god said it would be here
[1:10:28] we'll crest every one of them see how
[1:10:30] positive that is he said yeah we'll go
[1:10:32] right over the top of them yes indeed
[1:10:34] they can't sink us they can't drown us
[1:10:37] you put us in the grave we'll come out
[1:10:39] again
[1:10:40] that's just all there is to it there
[1:10:41] ain't no way in the world to keep it
[1:10:43] down there we'll crest every one of them
[1:10:45] because our great chief captain is
[1:10:47] calling at the other side whatever it
[1:10:50] might be let it come what may what will
[1:10:52] doesn't make any difference we're
[1:10:54] anchored right there in jesus if i live
[1:10:56] i'll live to the glory of god if i die i
[1:10:59] could die to the glory of god
[1:11:01] see we need to recognize this tonight i
[1:11:03] know some of us some of you are getting
[1:11:05] older
[1:11:06] and i feel for you although i've never
[1:11:08] been there myself
[1:11:09] so i can't really know but i'm beginning
[1:11:11] to know
[1:11:12] as you get into middle age you begin to
[1:11:14] feel just a glimpse of old age
[1:11:17] and then you know what it's in its
[1:11:18] reality what it's like some of you
[1:11:21] but brother branham taught us that we
[1:11:22] don't worry about that even during that
[1:11:24] time because it doesn't make any
[1:11:26] difference we're anchored in christ not
[1:11:28] in the condition of our body
[1:11:31] and if we live we live to the glory of
[1:11:33] god
[1:11:33] if we die we die to the glory of god
[1:11:36] paul said for me it's far better if i go
[1:11:39] he said but nevertheless i want the will
[1:11:41] of the lord to be done
[1:11:43] right he said for you it's better that i
[1:11:45] stay here but for me it's better that i
[1:11:46] go so for me to live is christ to die is
[1:11:49] gain yes
[1:11:50] amen i'm actually better off if i go
[1:11:52] home how can the devil then ever defeat
[1:11:55] a christian because he can't kill him he
[1:11:57] can't do anything to him the christian
[1:11:59] knows just death is just a it's just a
[1:12:02] room where you take photographs and it's
[1:12:04] a dark room i don't know if we would
[1:12:06] even understand what that is today but
[1:12:08] in the olden times you took your
[1:12:09] pictures up and you took them up to a
[1:12:11] place to have them developed and and two
[1:12:13] or three weeks later you'd go up and
[1:12:14] pick them up
[1:12:16] some of you remember doing that you
[1:12:18] realize these kids will never have to go
[1:12:20] through that
[1:12:21] when i was a kid when you took they took
[1:12:23] pictures at your birthday i never knew
[1:12:26] if the cameras were they may have been
[1:12:27] the same cameras at every birthday party
[1:12:29] it was them disposable cameras you
[1:12:31] remember
[1:12:32] they still have those i think in some
[1:12:33] places but but those disposable cameras
[1:12:36] you never knew if the pictures were any
[1:12:37] good you sure didn't get to post them
[1:12:39] the next day
[1:12:40] somebody had to remember to take the
[1:12:41] disposable camera up that's why there's
[1:12:43] no pictures of me anywhere
[1:12:45] as a child
[1:12:47] because they just took the i think
[1:12:48] there's two or three that exist to me is
[1:12:50] it because back then we just didn't do
[1:12:51] stuff like that
[1:12:53] but we didn't have thousands of pictures
[1:12:54] nothing wrong with it but we we took
[1:12:56] that picture and took it to the dark
[1:12:58] room if you were lucky enough to
[1:12:59] remember it if it was important enough
[1:13:02] you took it to the dark room and when it
[1:13:03] went through the dark room it had to go
[1:13:05] through that dark room so it could be
[1:13:06] developed from the negative to the
[1:13:08] positive brother brandon said that's
[1:13:10] what death is
[1:13:11] it's just a dark room that we're going
[1:13:13] through every one of us have to go
[1:13:15] through it he said it's just a he said
[1:13:17] he said death he said it's a like a
[1:13:19] carriage with horses hitched to it that
[1:13:21] carries us to the other side
[1:13:23] it's a dark room that develops the true
[1:13:25] image that god wanted this is not the
[1:13:27] end
[1:13:28] this is just the beginning
[1:13:30] yes this is just the testing time
[1:13:33] if i die i die to the glory of god it
[1:13:35] ought to keep us positive even i know as
[1:13:38] our bodies heard and as your body is
[1:13:40] hurting as you get older but it ought to
[1:13:42] have a positivity about it i know who i
[1:13:44] am i know and whom i have believe it i
[1:13:46] know i'm persuaded he's able to keep me
[1:13:48] to that day right
[1:13:50] hey man what a when we see that and some
[1:13:53] of you and i've seen that in many of you
[1:13:54] it gives us courage as younger people to
[1:13:56] keep going on keep pressing on don't get
[1:13:58] depressed and cranky
[1:14:03] sometimes we tend to don't do that but
[1:14:04] the brandon said god don't crown me as a
[1:14:06] as a crabby old man
[1:14:08] but let me be somebody that's sweet and
[1:14:10] godly and that can that can love people
[1:14:14] until i go to the other side
[1:14:16] god help us to do that tonight i didn't
[1:14:18] mean to preach at the old people that's
[1:14:19] the most faithful people we got
[1:14:22] i do that but joel i'm in trouble
[1:14:26] aren't you glad for old people
[1:14:30] amen i'm glad you're here but you got an
[1:14:33] anchor
[1:14:36] you got an anchor
[1:14:38] if i die i died of the glory of god he
[1:14:40] said it's just to the glory of god is
[1:14:41] what i want to do when that's all over i
[1:14:43] don't want to stay any longer
[1:14:46] he said i want to go to my reward that
[1:14:47] he bought for me
[1:14:49] not what i earned but what he bought for
[1:14:51] me
[1:14:52] what he give to me by his
[1:14:54] grace amen
[1:14:57] what is that stability
[1:14:59] in the midst of the storm
[1:15:01] jonah didn't understand it like he
[1:15:02] should but he was going to understand it
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:07] he said
[1:15:09] we must be stable in this hour
[1:15:11] but the random talks about wandering
[1:15:13] sons of god
[1:15:15] he said how the wondering sons of god
[1:15:17] wandering out there in the world some of
[1:15:19] them this denomination from denomination
[1:15:21] to denomination like wandering stars
[1:15:23] never stable like a leaf on the water in
[1:15:25] the autumn
[1:15:27] we used to see it he said back in the
[1:15:28] east the leaves would blow down on it
[1:15:30] every little wind would blow it from
[1:15:31] this side to that side if you've ever
[1:15:33] been fishing in the fall and there's a
[1:15:35] leaf on the water it'll just blow around
[1:15:37] everywhere
[1:15:38] he said but god wants us to be stable
[1:15:41] anchored in jesus the storms of life all
[1:15:43] brave anchored in jesus i fear no winds
[1:15:46] are waves see whatever it is many of you
[1:15:49] and watch this he said many of you
[1:15:50] remember the inch cape bell
[1:15:53] the inch cape bell he said when he was
[1:15:56] in school a boy and girl in school i
[1:15:58] think i've used this before but i had to
[1:16:01] go remind myself of it so i'm sure you
[1:16:03] don't remember it
[1:16:05] because i had to go and remind myself
[1:16:07] what the inch cape bell was
[1:16:10] and i didn't learn this in school
[1:16:11] because we're getting farther and
[1:16:12] farther away from the classics brother
[1:16:15] joel will tell you that i'm a lover of
[1:16:16] classic poems
[1:16:18] and my kids will tell you that as well
[1:16:20] because if you ever get a chance i'll
[1:16:22] quote them badly to you i i'll butcher
[1:16:24] them and everything else but i love them
[1:16:26] i just can't remember them
[1:16:29] but i love robert frost and and
[1:16:32] especially henry wadsworth longfellow i
[1:16:34] love longfellow and
[1:16:36] and the different english poets and
[1:16:38] american poets and i get off on that
[1:16:40] we'll just go all night but brother
[1:16:41] branham loved poetry and so he's
[1:16:43] referencing a poem
[1:16:45] that tells a story it's the inch cape
[1:16:48] lighthouse if you'll uh pull up that uh
[1:16:50] that that's the called the inch cape
[1:16:52] bell
[1:16:53] the inch cape bell was a bell that uh
[1:16:56] an abbot that lived off the coast of
[1:16:58] scotland
[1:16:59] there was ship after ship they'd come up
[1:17:01] when the tide was high to the coast of
[1:17:03] scotland and they'd wreck
[1:17:05] this uh this particular place actually
[1:17:07] wrecked over a hundred ships
[1:17:10] a hundred ships that wrecked on this
[1:17:12] particular place because the wind was
[1:17:14] whenever would storm the winds would
[1:17:15] blow them in and they couldn't see that
[1:17:17] they needed to drop an anchor
[1:17:20] they just kept going hoping they they
[1:17:22] were close to the shore but they
[1:17:23] couldn't see that they needed to drop an
[1:17:25] anchor because the water covered the
[1:17:27] rocks but just barely
[1:17:29] so the abbott went out and he took a
[1:17:31] bell and he tied it to a boy and he and
[1:17:34] that
[1:17:34] rested on the water and he took the bell
[1:17:37] and he put it out there and when they
[1:17:38] heard the bell they knew to get away
[1:17:40] or they knew to drop the anchor
[1:17:43] oh my
[1:17:44] god always gives a warning before
[1:17:46] judgment
[1:17:48] and so that bell was instrumental
[1:17:50] uh in
[1:17:52] in keeping ships from wrecking on the
[1:17:54] rocks
[1:17:56] and so the position of the rock of the
[1:17:58] reef was such that uh eventually they
[1:18:00] constructed a lighthouse i think i've
[1:18:02] got a picture of that as well as an
[1:18:03] actual picture of the lighthouse there
[1:18:05] on that rock you can see you can't see
[1:18:07] the rocks but they're under the water
[1:18:10] and so when the tide is up uh the
[1:18:12] lighthouse has to make sure that it
[1:18:13] keeps uh it keeps shining it's actually
[1:18:16] the oldest lighthouse uh in the ocean
[1:18:18] like that it's 200 years old the oldest
[1:18:21] one that's still operating today
[1:18:23] and the reef being completely submerged
[1:18:25] like that whenever men would come around
[1:18:28] there they would take a big gamble with
[1:18:29] their lives
[1:18:31] and and so they would listen for the
[1:18:32] bell
[1:18:34] but the poet tells the story the poet
[1:18:36] robert southie
[1:18:37] tells a story about the bell
[1:18:40] and he says no stir in the air no stir
[1:18:43] in the sea the ship was still as she
[1:18:44] could be her sails from heaven received
[1:18:47] no motion her kill was steady in the
[1:18:49] ocean
[1:18:50] without either sign or sound of their
[1:18:52] shock the waves float over the inch cape
[1:18:54] rock he said so little they rose so
[1:18:56] little they fell they did not move
[1:18:59] the inch cape bell
[1:19:01] and he talked about how that the abbott
[1:19:02] had put the bell on the inch cape rock
[1:19:04] on a boy in the storm it floated and
[1:19:06] swung and over the waves its warning
[1:19:09] rung and so they heard the bell didn't
[1:19:11] realize they were creeping up on
[1:19:12] disaster and so they dropped their
[1:19:14] anchor
[1:19:15] but the poem and i don't have time to
[1:19:17] read all of it but goes on to say that a
[1:19:18] pirate named robert the rover
[1:19:21] a wandering sort of fellow
[1:19:23] a wandering star
[1:19:25] decided he was going to cut down the
[1:19:27] bell
[1:19:28] because he wanted to
[1:19:31] wreak destruction on the people of that
[1:19:33] time and so he got angry because they
[1:19:36] put the bell up there and he was so
[1:19:38] confident in his own ability
[1:19:40] that he cut down the bell
[1:19:42] and then he
[1:19:43] went out and plundered the oceans and
[1:19:45] comes back with a great load of gold and
[1:19:47] silver and things that he's stolen and
[1:19:50] gets in a storm at the very spot where
[1:19:52] he cut the bell
[1:19:55] and his ship wrecked
[1:19:57] and he lost his life
[1:19:59] because he failed to put down an anchor
[1:20:02] oh god the bell was a warning
[1:20:05] and i think today it's kind of a long
[1:20:07] way around to tell it but i think in the
[1:20:08] storms of life sometimes we don't want
[1:20:10] to heed the warning
[1:20:12] the word of god is a warning to us
[1:20:14] god calls ministers as warning to us
[1:20:17] a warning a bell that's ringing
[1:20:19] and sometimes we don't want to hear it
[1:20:22] and so we cut the bell down and we do it
[1:20:24] to our own destruction
[1:20:26] heed the warning today put down your
[1:20:28] anchor in the word
[1:20:30] be stable don't disregard the message of
[1:20:32] the hour
[1:20:33] even in the little things say well i can
[1:20:35] get by with doing this don't disregard
[1:20:37] the message of the hour it's a bell
[1:20:40] warning you how to stay out of the
[1:20:41] shipwreck of the culture that you're in
[1:20:44] don't disregard the message
[1:20:47] and so that bell that that anchor is an
[1:20:49] absolute you got to put something down
[1:20:51] that that you're not that you're going
[1:20:53] to listen to the warning and put down an
[1:20:55] anchor
[1:20:56] and brother brandon said in the day that
[1:20:57] we're living in now everything is so
[1:20:58] breaking up so fragile and carried away
[1:21:01] he said i think this message would be a
[1:21:03] very appropriate thing to christians he
[1:21:05] said when they're going through their
[1:21:06] deep waters now
[1:21:08] he said the christian church is passing
[1:21:10] through the deepest water it's had for
[1:21:12] the last 2000 years
[1:21:14] because we're coming to a spot where
[1:21:16] there is something presented to
[1:21:17] christianity something they have to make
[1:21:20] a decision on he said and i think that
[1:21:22] the christian church ought to have
[1:21:23] something that they know they are tied
[1:21:25] to
[1:21:26] instead of just like floating about like
[1:21:27] a leaf upon the water the wind he said
[1:21:29] okay i'll have a good pastor i'll have a
[1:21:31] good church that's not what he's talking
[1:21:33] about
[1:21:34] he's talking about being tied to christ
[1:21:37] the word
[1:21:38] you need a good pastor you need a good
[1:21:40] church but what you need most of all is
[1:21:42] your life to be tight on the word
[1:21:45] right
[1:21:47] so now he says
[1:21:48] he says instead of just floating like a
[1:21:50] leaf upon the water as the bible said
[1:21:52] carried about by every wind of doctrine
[1:21:53] the winds come and blow the little leaf
[1:21:55] this way another wind comes the north
[1:21:57] wind the south wind the east wind the
[1:21:58] west wind
[1:21:59] he said
[1:22:01] you'll never get anywhere you're not
[1:22:02] stable the christian life should be a
[1:22:03] stable life it should be something
[1:22:04] that's a principle that you're tied to
[1:22:06] that is more than life itself
[1:22:09] he said you must have something that
[1:22:10] you're tied to
[1:22:12] some people are tied to their business
[1:22:15] some people are tied to their families
[1:22:17] some are tied to a creed
[1:22:19] some are tied to the army post we have
[1:22:22] different things that we're tied to but
[1:22:24] i think as a christian we ought to be
[1:22:26] tied where we know is right
[1:22:28] because you might be tied to your family
[1:22:30] your wife could leave you
[1:22:33] you might be tied to the army you might
[1:22:35] get killed you might be tied to any
[1:22:37] different things it's got an end but
[1:22:38] there's got to be a final type host
[1:22:40] there's got to be somewhere that man has
[1:22:42] got to tie for his eternal destination
[1:22:44] because if you're going to trust it in
[1:22:45] your work when your work is finished
[1:22:47] it's done when your family is taken it's
[1:22:49] over but there's only one thing i think
[1:22:51] is the final type of he said i believe
[1:22:53] that paul had a typos in his life here
[1:22:55] he said for me to live is christ to die
[1:22:57] is gain
[1:22:58] he said christ was paul's absolute
[1:23:01] it was his type post it was the end of
[1:23:03] all arguments it was christ
[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:06] oh do you believe that tonight christ
[1:23:08] has been your type post you don't have
[1:23:10] to fear the wind and the storm
[1:23:13] god's just having his way in the
[1:23:14] whirlwind
[1:23:16] amen paul had an anchor
[1:23:18] and i think jonah would learn as we
[1:23:20] continue on in the story uh well jonah
[1:23:23] another night i won't go into it tonight
[1:23:25] but as we continue on we'll find jonah
[1:23:27] would learn about the
[1:23:29] how god had things in his hand
[1:23:31] but right now he didn't understand that
[1:23:33] so he tried to run
[1:23:35] but paul understood it
[1:23:37] paul had been told he was he would give
[1:23:38] his testimony to caesar
[1:23:40] he had any but he had an anchor
[1:23:43] he had the word of the lord
[1:23:45] he knew his table in the storm and in
[1:23:48] acts 27 and 13
[1:23:50] paul was involved in a storm
[1:23:52] and the wind blew in a contrary
[1:23:55] direction and finally
[1:23:57] and you got to watch because this is
[1:23:59] true of all of our lives that sometimes
[1:24:01] soft winds will blow and we think we're
[1:24:03] okay
[1:24:04] so we let up we take up the anchor
[1:24:08] how many of you ever been in that spot
[1:24:10] you get a good job you have a lot going
[1:24:13] for you a lot's going on and so soft
[1:24:15] winds are blowing
[1:24:17] and you say well i'm okay
[1:24:19] everything's okay
[1:24:21] i'll just drift
[1:24:23] we'll take up the anchor for a while and
[1:24:24] that's what they did the south wind blew
[1:24:26] softly better watch out there's a storm
[1:24:28] coming
[1:24:31] supposing that they had obtained their
[1:24:32] purpose losing thence they sailed close
[1:24:35] by crete
[1:24:37] but not long after
[1:24:39] oh isn't that always the story of our
[1:24:40] lives
[1:24:41] not long after we think we're okay
[1:24:45] all of a sudden
[1:24:46] there arose against it a tempestuous
[1:24:48] wind called yourocladine yorkledon he
[1:24:51] said when the ship was caught and could
[1:24:53] not bear up into the wind
[1:24:55] we let her drive
[1:24:57] that could not bear up into the wind is
[1:24:59] a fascinating expressive phrase because
[1:25:02] it's actually
[1:25:03] saying that
[1:25:05] they could not face up to the wind
[1:25:06] remember what we said about jonah jonah
[1:25:09] couldn't face up to the to what god told
[1:25:11] him to do
[1:25:12] and so he become a man running from the
[1:25:14] presence of god
[1:25:15] and the ship that paul was in could not
[1:25:17] face up to the storm
[1:25:20] and so
[1:25:21] even english sailors would would call
[1:25:23] the bow of the ship and they'd put eyes
[1:25:25] on it and they called it the eyes of a
[1:25:27] ship
[1:25:28] so the sailors
[1:25:30] let it drive or gave way
[1:25:32] because of the storm and so it was just
[1:25:34] run anytime you let a ship run it'll end
[1:25:37] up on the rocks
[1:25:39] he said
[1:25:40] and and so that they said that it was it
[1:25:42] was caught in the wind it could not face
[1:25:44] up to the wind
[1:25:45] and we let her drive
[1:25:47] but after a long and go down to verse 21
[1:25:50] said after long abstinence paul stood
[1:25:52] forth in the midst of them and said sirs
[1:25:55] you should have hearkened unto me and
[1:25:56] not have loosed from crete remember when
[1:25:58] that soft wind was blowing he warned him
[1:26:00] he said don't do that
[1:26:01] don't let go of your anchor
[1:26:03] he said you should have hearkened
[1:26:05] he said and to have gained this harm and
[1:26:06] loss he said now
[1:26:09] i exhort you to be of good shear
[1:26:11] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[1:26:13] life among you
[1:26:15] but of the ship
[1:26:17] for there stood by me this night the
[1:26:19] angel of god whose i am and whom i serve
[1:26:22] look at the confidence that paul has
[1:26:24] i'm closing in just a moment so hang
[1:26:26] with me look at the confidence that that
[1:26:28] man has he said i know
[1:26:30] yes
[1:26:30] that we're going to make it all right
[1:26:33] oh i wish i could get that through to
[1:26:34] you and only you're going to make it
[1:26:37] peter you're going to make it yes
[1:26:39] brother j.t you're going to make it i
[1:26:41] know why do i know because an angel of
[1:26:43] god told me we had a prophet messenger
[1:26:46] in our day i don't have to see a vision
[1:26:48] or a dream or anything else to know
[1:26:51] that we're going to make it we had a
[1:26:53] prophet that said you'll crest every
[1:26:54] wave we had a prophet that said this
[1:26:56] end-time bribe would not be deceived
[1:26:59] you're going to make it
[1:27:01] oh my no matter what the storm looks
[1:27:03] like right now he said there won't be a
[1:27:05] loss of any man's life
[1:27:07] he said there stood by me this night the
[1:27:09] angel of god whose i am and whom i serve
[1:27:11] saying fear not paul thou must be
[1:27:13] brought before caesar and lo god hath
[1:27:15] given thee all someone say oh
[1:27:18] oh god hath given thee all them that
[1:27:20] sail with thee you might lose the ship
[1:27:22] you might lose the stuff but you're not
[1:27:24] going to lose the people
[1:27:26] yes
[1:27:27] oh god help us tonight you might lose
[1:27:29] the things of life but you won't lose to
[1:27:31] people
[1:27:33] god knew this storm was coming
[1:27:35] and he said we're going to make it
[1:27:37] hallelujah
[1:27:39] god hath given thee all them that sail
[1:27:41] with thee
[1:27:42] wherefore sirs be of good cheer
[1:27:46] they must have thought he was nuts
[1:27:49] it's in there and the boat's cracking up
[1:27:51] there's water seeping in everywhere the
[1:27:54] sailors are shouting and running
[1:27:56] and the ship is tossing and paul says
[1:27:58] wait a minute guys you're going to be
[1:28:00] okay
[1:28:02] sometimes we have to stand and say that
[1:28:04] in the world that we're living in we
[1:28:05] need to tell our children you're going
[1:28:06] to be okay you need to tell the church
[1:28:08] we're going to be okay we're going to
[1:28:10] make it right
[1:28:12] when it's cracking up on the rocks but i
[1:28:13] believe god what do you believe
[1:28:16] i believe god i believe god said we're
[1:28:18] going to make it
[1:28:20] i believe god above the wind
[1:28:22] i believe god above the storms i believe
[1:28:25] god above the hurricane above the
[1:28:26] sickness above politics
[1:28:28] right are you with me tonight i believe
[1:28:30] god above everything
[1:28:32] his word is true let every other word
[1:28:34] every man's word be alive and his to be
[1:28:36] true yes
[1:28:38] amen i believe god above the hurricane i
[1:28:40] believe god above the politics i believe
[1:28:42] god above the sickness yes i believe god
[1:28:44] above the hardship going on in my life
[1:28:46] right now yes
[1:28:47] look at jonah
[1:28:49] look at him now seemingly back sid
[1:28:52] out of the will of god
[1:28:54] running from the presence of the lord
[1:28:57] but jonah 117 said tells us this
[1:29:01] now the lord
[1:29:03] amen
[1:29:04] the lord had prepared
[1:29:07] had prepared
[1:29:09] he didn't have to go scrambling looking
[1:29:11] for a big fish
[1:29:13] trying to get him there on time
[1:29:16] think about the logistics of this
[1:29:20] god's the greatest logistician that's a
[1:29:23] word if that's how you say it that's
[1:29:24] ever been that's ever been on the earth
[1:29:28] because look what he does he he comes
[1:29:30] and
[1:29:31] and jonah is going to be driven in the
[1:29:33] by the wind he's going to leave thinking
[1:29:34] he's going all the way to the other side
[1:29:36] of the world the first night a storm
[1:29:38] comes up he's driven by the wind
[1:29:41] and we don't know whether he was driven
[1:29:42] towards the ocean or away from it but
[1:29:44] brother venom tells us that in some of
[1:29:46] those places it was a mile or two miles
[1:29:48] deep
[1:29:49] and down there a mile or two miles deep
[1:29:51] there's a there's a fish
[1:29:55] and knowing how god does things i'd say
[1:29:57] that fish was a baby one time
[1:30:00] didn't know what his purpose was
[1:30:03] didn't know what he was going to be but
[1:30:06] one day he kept growing and growing and
[1:30:08] growing and the other official came and
[1:30:10] said what in the world
[1:30:15] dude you need to go to the gym
[1:30:20] it's a big fish
[1:30:22] he just
[1:30:23] god likes big things
[1:30:25] and small things too right
[1:30:27] he's a bit this this this is a big fish
[1:30:30] he's begging to swallow a man
[1:30:33] and here he comes he gets keeps getting
[1:30:35] bigger and bigger and bigger he don't
[1:30:36] fit in anywhere and he's just wandering
[1:30:38] around the ocean thinking he don't have
[1:30:39] no purpose but suddenly he fills a pole
[1:30:44] to go when he reaches a certain size
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:47] he fills a pole and gets hungry for
[1:30:49] backslidden profit
[1:30:51] so brother branham said he said god
[1:30:53] prepared a fish for jonah and a meal for
[1:30:55] the whale
[1:30:57] a meal for the fish
[1:30:59] he said it was a backslidden profit meal
[1:31:04] amen so he got down there and
[1:31:06] he happens to be in the right spot here
[1:31:09] comes jonah out of the boat
[1:31:11] splashes down the water and he sinks and
[1:31:13] he sinks and he sinks and there's a
[1:31:15] great big mouth
[1:31:17] my goodness just dropped right on me
[1:31:19] dinner
[1:31:20] biggest thing i've eaten in a while
[1:31:23] he swallows it whole
[1:31:25] he's so hungry
[1:31:27] oh my
[1:31:28] the lord had prepared
[1:31:32] anybody he don't say how long he took to
[1:31:33] do it
[1:31:35] so you don't understand at the other
[1:31:36] side of your storm god's already
[1:31:37] prepared the fish that's going to
[1:31:38] swallow you
[1:31:41] and taxi you to your destination
[1:31:44] brother brown said the fish was a taxi
[1:31:49] he's going to take jonah to a spot where
[1:31:50] he could get to the end of it
[1:31:52] he never was going to make it much
[1:31:53] farther than where he started
[1:31:56] but the fish would be a taxi
[1:31:58] oh my
[1:32:00] and so god prepared
[1:32:02] god's already prepared in the storm of
[1:32:04] your life a great fish
[1:32:07] to swallow you up
[1:32:09] and keep you yes
[1:32:11] oh my until you have a testimony
[1:32:14] i come through the storm
[1:32:17] but you know his greatest testimony
[1:32:18] wasn't coming through the storm
[1:32:20] we don't talk about jonah and the storm
[1:32:23] we talk about jonah in the belly of the
[1:32:24] well
[1:32:27] you imagine
[1:32:28] we'll get to him there next time but he
[1:32:30] goes down into the ocean and thinks oh
[1:32:32] that's the worst it could get not yet
[1:32:36] you're fixing to go into wells belly
[1:32:38] fixing to see what it's like on the
[1:32:39] inside of a well
[1:32:41] i can tell you it's not pretty if you've
[1:32:43] ever gutted a fish you know
[1:32:47] a fish's belly is not a pretty thing
[1:32:51] it gets on the inside of it and god has
[1:32:53] a talk with him oh my he has a talk with
[1:32:56] god yes
[1:32:58] the sovereign god had already prepared a
[1:33:00] way out of the storm
[1:33:01] but it wasn't any way that he could have
[1:33:03] imagined
[1:33:06] if you told jonah a day before that
[1:33:08] tomorrow night you're going to be in a
[1:33:09] whale's belly he wouldn't have believed
[1:33:11] you
[1:33:13] god didn't even tell him
[1:33:16] god don't tell his prophets everything
[1:33:18] he just let him go through it
[1:33:21] sometimes god just wants to let you go
[1:33:22] through it
[1:33:24] let him be god
[1:33:26] can we do that tonight
[1:33:28] in closing musicians go ahead and come
[1:33:30] see the exit from the storm is not what
[1:33:33] you think it is
[1:33:36] let god be god you've already prepared a
[1:33:39] way to fulfill his word in your life he
[1:33:41] said but brother ben if i don't rush if
[1:33:43] i don't hurry if i don't
[1:33:45] you know you know me those of you who
[1:33:46] have dealt with me very much you know i
[1:33:48] don't get in a hurry about much of
[1:33:49] anything when it comes to especially
[1:33:50] when it comes to the church
[1:33:52] i like things to move slow
[1:33:54] and there's a reason for that
[1:33:56] because
[1:33:57] because i'm always i always know that
[1:33:59] myself when i get into hurry i get in
[1:34:01] trouble that's how i end up with with uh
[1:34:04] uh things i can't afford
[1:34:06] you know what's that
[1:34:08] that first
[1:34:09] that inclination you buy it and then you
[1:34:11] get buyers remorse so they tell you to
[1:34:13] wait a night wait a couple days
[1:34:15] see if you still want it
[1:34:17] you won't have so much buyer's remorse
[1:34:19] move slow but the brandon said look 10
[1:34:21] times and take one step
[1:34:24] you don't have to solve tomorrow's
[1:34:26] problems
[1:34:27] sufficient to the day is the evil
[1:34:29] thereof let god be god he's got a way
[1:34:32] out that you haven't even dreamed of yet
[1:34:35] you can't even imagine what he's going
[1:34:37] to do in your life
[1:34:38] [Music]
[1:34:40] who would have dreamed we'd have been
[1:34:41] here
[1:34:42] some of you elders that have been around
[1:34:43] for many many decades who would have
[1:34:45] dreamed we'd be here tonight
[1:34:47] who would have dreamed the world would
[1:34:49] be in the condition that it's in
[1:34:50] politics would be where it is the church
[1:34:52] would be where it is
[1:34:54] who would have dreamed it but god had a
[1:34:56] fish
[1:34:58] he something prepared for us to make us
[1:35:01] a sign and a living epistle right of all
[1:35:03] men in the day and hour that we live in
[1:35:06] don't give up he sees the other side of
[1:35:08] the storm
[1:35:09] he knows you're going to make it
[1:35:11] i love this quote
[1:35:13] but the brandon said remember
[1:35:15] where jonah went
[1:35:16] god was in the boat
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:22] he was running from god but god was in
[1:35:24] the boat
[1:35:26] god was in the storm
[1:35:29] god was in the fish
[1:35:32] he went on being right along with jonah
[1:35:35] until his perfect will
[1:35:37] was done
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:42] you might be in the boat tonight you
[1:35:43] might be in the fish you might be in the
[1:35:44] storm you might be things might be going
[1:35:46] pretty good might be some south winds
[1:35:48] blowing
[1:35:49] wherever you're at god's there
[1:35:51] let him take charge of your life
[1:35:53] he's already prepared a way to fulfill
[1:35:55] his word in your life would you bow your
[1:35:57] heads with me for just a moment
[1:36:00] as we meditate on the word of god
[1:36:02] tonight and
[1:36:03] think about these things
[1:36:05] maybe you just pray this way lord i i
[1:36:07] believe
[1:36:08] i believe you've got control of the
[1:36:11] winds
[1:36:12] i believe that the same god who sent the
[1:36:15] wind can take it back
[1:36:17] believe that the same god who
[1:36:20] who made
[1:36:21] who allowed some of the things that have
[1:36:23] happened in my life and
[1:36:25] yet many of them my own stupidity but
[1:36:27] yet
[1:36:28] god allowed it and
[1:36:29] somehow there's a fish prepared if i'll
[1:36:32] just believe his word and trust him from
[1:36:34] here on out
[1:36:35] even my own stupidity won't keep me from
[1:36:37] the promises
[1:36:39] even my own stubbornness
[1:36:43] won't keep me from the promises
[1:36:45] you just talk to him like they say lord
[1:36:47] i believe
[1:36:48] i believe that you you got a way
[1:36:50] prepared for me i don't have to force it
[1:36:52] i don't have to make something happen
[1:36:54] where it's not there
[1:36:56] i can just
[1:36:57] ride on the on in the boat
[1:36:59] if you if i end up in the fish i'll ride
[1:37:01] in the fish end up on the shore i'll
[1:37:03] walk towards nineveh i'll do what he
[1:37:05] tells me to do
