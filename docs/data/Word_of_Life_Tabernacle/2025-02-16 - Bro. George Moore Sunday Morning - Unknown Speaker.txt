sounds good to me I uh been uh been up north and out west and they just don't know how to talk so I'm glad to be back with you today and you know I was getting sick of that Sunny 75 degree weather and I said man I got to get me some good weather Brother David I I got to get out here where where they know what weather's all about and so by the grace of God it's rained on me since I got off the airplane in Memphis and it's rained on me ever since so uh but we hadn't even seen rain about four or five months in two son so amen good to be here with you God bless you all one of my favorite places on Earth is here and and so just an honor and a privilege and appreciate brother Ben and and I even appreciate Joel pretty well and so and God bless you this morning while we're all standing we'll go right straight into the word this morning I don't want to take up much time but a little something on my heart and and uh St John the first chapter very familiar I'm sure we've all read it and can recite it without even Opening Our Bibles but uh just something that the Lord put on my heart today bring you greetings from Brother Israel and the Saints at Shalom Tabernacle and Tucson and just got moved in this is the very first service in a new church and so uh quite a testimony of what the Lord did there for us and and so we're happy for those things and God's a provider of all of our needs Saints and so yes St John the first chapter and the first verse we'll begin reading in the beginning was the and the was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light so we see here Saints the proper placement of the prophet of the age uh that he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light and and if we try to make him more or less than that then we're we're putting him in a position God didn't put him in and the ninth verse says that was the True Light which lith every man notice it says it lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God aren't you glad even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God can we bow our heads Heavenly Father we're so grateful today to be assembled in this church with the purchase of your blood and we're grateful that Lord Jesus that you called us out of this Darkness into this light and father we just ask that for the next few minutes Lord that you would Minister to the needs of the people Lord we invite you to come and walk up and down the aisles of this church Lord and Lord speak to us and Lord may we go like those from EMAs saying did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way and opened to us the scripture Lord I pray that you'd just watch over me mind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a church said amen God bless you may be seated and title of the message this morning is enlightened by the shikina glory enlightened by the shikina glory now we find in the scripture here that the the Bible said that in him Jesus Christ was life and that the life was the light of men not not that the light was the life but that the the life was the light and so we find brothers and sisters that it's the life of Jesus Christ the life it's it's it's the walking like Jesus and talking like G it's the life that Jesus represents that is the light of the world and and we find that that is the light that shines out into the darkness because if you're a Believer and the life of Jesus Christ is living in you you cannot hide it Saints it's it's something that's a part of you you don't have to broadcast it you don't have to tell everybody about it they're just going to figure it out if the life is in you you become the life of Jesus Christ and the life is the light and the light will shine in the darkness and Saints it's also true that the darkness don't like the light and so you're going to find yourself in situations where maybe you got pressures on you that you wouldn't have if it wasn't for the life that was in you but the life is the light can you say Amen this morning and that was the True Light it says which light every man that comes in the world and so it's not just the the good men that are lit by the by the Light it's the it's every seed is lit by the same light and so and whatever seed is in you will come to light when the light strikes it now is that right this morning Saints it's like the sunlight the Su n the trees out here and the grass out here they get their life by soaking up the energy from the Sun and every seed does it the weeds do it the briers do it the trees do it the grass does it it all gets its life from the same sun and so is it with that predestinated seed that's down in you Saints the light comes from the Sun and it's going to bring forth of its kind so that's why you see well how you got so much evil and different things some of it's even in the message well because it's a seed that's in there and this light brings forth the light that's in that seed now is that right Saints good because in him was light yes sir in him was light and and the Bible goes on to say that every man that receives him aren't you glad saints that you had the ability to receive him every seed that receives him to them he gave power to become the Son of God Amen now now think about this Saints we've talked about this before I know but if you are the Son of God what is your nature it's the nature of God am me if if a if a cow has a calf what nature is the calf it's it's a cow Saints amen and so if you're a Son of God what nature are [Applause] you come on see it's it's the love life that's the light not not not hearers of the word come on but doers of the word is that right it's not just it's just not listening to the tape or listening to the message or reading the Bible or listening to the preaching but it's it's doing what the message says do it's it's doing what the Bible says do it's doing what the ministry says do it's it's it's emulating it's living the light because the light is the life you can't say you got the life if you're not living it Saints now I know this is simple this morning but but the Bible is in book form it's almost completely powerless this is just a book but if I can open this book and I can receive come on somebody if I can receive what the book says and live what the book says then I become the Bible amen that's good you become the Bible we become the word as we receive the word and that's what we're looking to do today Saints I want to be more of the word than I was when I walked in here I want to walk out of here more of this Bible than I was when I came amen when you see me next month I want to be more of the Bible when you see me next year I want to be more of the Bible because it's in book form but I want it to be in my hearts and the sun brings life into the world and the light shows imperfection the light shows the OV see it's sisters come on Joel I know you paint and anybody ever painted a wall and thought it looked good until the light hit it see the light's what shows the imperfections if you do some Sheetrock work and you think you got it smooth and it looks good until the light hits it it's the light that shows the imperfections if you if you if your sisters clean the window and you think the window looks clean everything looks good you wash both sides of it everything looks good until the light hits it and you recognize the spots that got missed oh come on somebody today it looks good the floor looks good after you sweep it after you mop it it looks good until the light hits it and you realize oh I missed that over there oh I missed that over here the light shows the dirty places the light shows the imperfections even the air you breathe you think well this is good clean air that I'm breathing right here but if you ever watch it when the sun comes in you say look at all that junk floating around in the air that I'm breathing because the light shows the imperfections and Saints it's the same way with a child of God the more the light that you get the more imperfections you realize the closer to God you get the more you realize you need to work on come on Sir true that's right good come on that's good PR You Can't Hide to life the seed will produce after its kind yeah that's right no matter what you do it will produce after its own you can't help it Saints I don't care where you was when the light shined on you I know where I don't know where you was but I know where I was and I know what happened when the light shined on me I know it didn't matter what life I'd live it didn't matter how backslid I was it didn't matter my upbringing it didn't matter my family it didn't matter all the friends that I had it didn't matter my hobbies and my habits when the light shined on me Saints everything changed all of it changed I I was a new creature it didn't matter where I was at nobody in my church nobody went to F went to church in my family I'm the only one that went to church it didn't matter it wouldn't matter if I was on the back side of the desert it wouldn't have matter if I was in the jungles in Africa it wouldn't have matter where I was at when the light strikes it brings forth life Saints it doesn't me you can't hide it you can't stop it true that's right the seed produces that see there was a bunch of Pharisees that looked at Jesus and said he's be above he's a devil but a prostitute that had too many husbands saw him and said you're the Son of God because the seed that was in there was different it might have looked one way in the beginning you might have looked one way in the beginning but the seed that's in there produces the life of the seed Pharisees look good but they call Jesus a devil but this woman didn't look good but she knew he was the son of God that's right come on oh come on this morning Saints aren't you thankful for the seed that's inside of you thank that when the light struck you had the ability to recognize it the ability to hear the ability to receive what the messenger was saying Thank You Lord everybody else can listen to it and say that man's crazy but you listen to it and said that's the word of God GL to God Amen why the seed that's in you yeah that's right brother said in the message why Christ speak he said that little prostitute said well this fell is the Messiah oh yeah the scripture says he'll do this see that predestinated seed was laying there oh yeah and when the light Struck it it come to life he said you can't keep it down come on right you can't keep it down you can't keep me down they can't keep you down Saints oh you might get down sometime you might have a hard day but they can't keep you down the devil can't keep you down you're predestinated to lie I read the back of the book and you win that's right thank you Lord thank you Lord Glory he said you pour that concrete out there yeah and then in he said the winter goes it dies out he said but but but but when the spring comes right around the edge of that concrete is the thickest grass cuz the gerti seed was laying under that concrete and when the sun comes that seed has got to work its way to the sun he said it'll stick its head up to the glory of God oh God Saints and they don't matter what your background was when the seeds in you you'll stick your head up to the glory of God am oh so grateful for that thank you Lord you can't you can't quiet them down Barn couldn't see a thing but they told him Jesus was coming he couldn't see Jesus but they said Jesus is coming and he cried out have mercy on me son have mercy on me thank you Lord they say quiet down back there Barn meus don't make so much noise quiet down back there and cried out the more have mercy on me have mercy on me Hallelujah and it was the crying out brother Ben the cried outs that stopped Jesus in his tracks right Lord good Hallelujah yes cuz he was a seed yes thank you Lord he stuck his head up to the glory of God he said you can't hide life when a sun strikes botney like it's got to live and when the Holy Spirit strikes the SC spir scriptural life that's in a man he says it brings forth its fruit right there oh thank you Lord amen now that's not once and done on that's every time the Holy Spirit strikes the seed every time the life strikes the seed Saints it brings forth life oh I'm getting better you're getting better we're getting better Saints but because the holy spirit is striking the seed Amen on that's good and the closer you get to God the more faults you find out you got that's right that's true but the Bible said that when you receive the light you then become the light so then it's no longer Jesus no longer the word it's the light living in you are the light the bride is the final voice to the final age you become the light y want to read that Matthew 5:14 says ye that's you when it says ye that's you ye are the light of the world right yes sir see I know what God did 2,000 years ago right I know what he did in 1950 I know what he did in 1960 but ye are the light of the world that's right now that's right amen but because the light that lives in Jesus is living in you come on good City that's set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle put it under a bush but on a Candlestick to give light to all that's in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father now see this is very important Saints because if you have good works it ain't you you didn't want to do it come on it wasn't your nature if there's anything good about you it ain't you so it ain't to glorify you if you got a gift to preach it ain't you if you can sing it ain't you if you can play an instrument it ain't you if you can help somebody it ain't you if there's Love in Your Heart It Ain't you it didn't come from you it came from him and it was given for you to glorify him with so if you can preach you glorify him with it if you can sing you glorify him with it see too many times people take the gifts of God and use it to glorify themselves come on but it was given to glorify him with so if we approach everything from the standpoint of how can I use the gift that God's G me to glorify him come good preach because the closer you get to God the more mistakes you realize you make that's right the more problems you realize you got the more faults you realize you have because the light shines on those Dark Places come on come on the more light of the word that shines in your life the dirtier things look to you but we don't complain about the dirt we thank God for the light yeah that's good amen if the if the kitchen floor is dirty don't complain about the dirt thank God you can see the dirt so you can take action amen otherwise you just have a dirty floor everybody else can see it but you can't see it thank God you can see it thank God he's revealing it to you and showing you what you need to work on because it's an opportunity to get it right I'm grateful for it Saints I'm glad that that he showing me because I don't want to be wrong I want to be right thank you Lord good buddy come on see we don't let the devil beat us up about God's program come on see the devil wants to get in there and Whisper see all this stuff that's wrong in your life see all the things you need to do see all the stuff you need to work on and you say yes I can see it why can you see it because God's showing you Glory Glory Hallelujah well the devil say well you're not a good enough Christian you're not good enough no that's a sign you are that's right because everybody can't repent Cain couldn't repent but you can you have the opportunity it's God working in you that's right that's good good that's real good knoweth it not he says the higher you rise in God the more sinful the whole thing looks right and then sometimes he says in prayer you can imagine when the Holy Spirit takes you into a spear then the whole thing looks chaos he said but if you ever climb into them Spears one time he says where you can be in the Pres of God not through emotion but through genuine Holy Spirit lifting up the whole thing is wrote hiab the glory of the Lord has departed from the whole denominational outfits he said there's none of them right now look here Saints we don't condemn The Sinner we condemn the sin we don't ever get so high and mighty that we can't talk to a sinner we don't ever get so religious or so messy that we don't want to see a sinner fall down at this Altar and be born again into the kingdom of God if he saved you he can save anybody that's right that's right we know we can't lose our heart for the people we can't lose our feeling for the people we can't lose our desire to see one more Soul come to the grace of God to see the blood change one more life yes sir good don't ever lose that we don't condemn The Sinner but we can't stand the sin but it's the light that's in you that's calling it out that's right amen come on good good preach conviction condemnation repentance it's all a tool in the hand of God the entire Christian walk is built on repentance that's right that's right on in Acts two everybody quotes 38 but before that there was 37 that's right that's deep teaching ain't it Brother David y'all can get out of here say brother George said 37 come before 38 but Peter was preaching to them on that Jesus the Christ had come that the Son of God had come and that they had crucified him they had killed the son of God and the Bible said it's very important they were pricked in their hearts yes thank you Lord for amen thank thank you they were pricked in their hearts Saints that's a critical step to be pricked in your hearts to to be condemned to be to be convicted about something it's critical the another translation says they were cut to the heart that's right it cut God came his son came and we killed him and cut him to the hearts and then they cried out what must we do to be saved without that step Saints you're going down a wet Center a dry Center and coming up a w come on it's a dry High confession come on that's true Hebrews chapter 7 number two to he says the believer can't sin I'm going read it again I'm going read it again the believer can't sin certainly not the seed of God the blessings of God remains on him gy to God oh somebody ought to shout hallelujah to know that the blessings of God remains on you yes sir when you feel like it when you're doing good when you're doing bad the blessings of God remains on you so you say well why do we got to repent then brother George well he says cuz God can't see nothing but the blood of his own son you can't sin cuz he can't see it because there's an atonement laying there that's that's oh not C you're fantastic but because you got an atonement laying there and when he looks through he don't see it he sees the atonement you're perfect today because you got a blood sacrifice because you're you're your sacrifice was perfect he said in one place he says he he you pray he don't he don't see you he hears your voice but he sees the blood of Jesus Christ he said it's your voice and Christ blood on Sir the blood sacrifice is what makes you perfect the atonement is what makes you perfect the the blood sacrifice is what makes you sinless come on cuz he says this he says God can't see nothing but his own blood no matter what is in his church what it is God don't see it because Jesus is making intercessions constantly the high priest oh see in order for the to be sinless he's got to come under the blood now you might see my faults I might see your faults but Jesus is making an atonement so when God looks he can't see it that's a that's amazing Saints he says there's no way for him to sin when such a sacrifice is laying there for him see I don't count the blood of the Covenant an unclean thing I'm grateful that there's a sacrifice laying there for me he said now if you say well that gives me a good chance he said that shows you're not right to begin with you don't want to take advantage of that you hadn't got it to begin with if you want try to take advantage of it say I can live any way I want to I can do whatever I want to yes you can but the Nature's changed and what you want to do has changed not to take advantage all I want to live no but it's to say that if you make a mistake if you have a bad thought if you say something you shouldn't say if you say something you didn't want to do if have something going on in your life you have a sacrifice thank you Lord right thank you Lord he says this now you will do wrong right sir but you won't do it willfully on he says you're trapped and anything you're trapped into or do something you don't mean to do it's not sin yet you'll repent the minute you see that you're wrong oh so it ain't sin yet because when I recognize it I have the ability to repent of it see the devil has a way of putting thoughts in your mind and blaming you for having them yeah that's right good that's not you you're trapped into that and when you have that thought immediately you repent Lord forgive me come on that's good that's real good good yes sir on now he said now he said you'll turn quickly and say I didn't I didn't mean to do that that's right true he says you'll do that all through life so I've been in the message five years I'm going to do this 10 years I'm going to do it 20 years I'm going to do it 50 years I'm still going to be doing it GL God all through life that's right but it's God's provided way that's right it's God's he said there's a blood atonement for us all the time to keep us covered he said now the legalist would say if somebody makes a mistake they'd say well I know bless God she backslid I know she backslid H bless God she done wrong I know she's backslid he said that's wrong that's right she's not backslid she made a mistake he said if she did it willfully she wasn't right to begin with but she made a mistake and and he says he said if she didn't mean to do it she walks before the Holy Church of God and confesses it and says I'm wrong and you forgive me he said your duty bound to do it he said if you don't do it in your hearts you ought to be at the altar yourself sir on right he said there's the real Holiness in the church there's the genuine Holiness not of you but of Christ he said I have no Holiness to present to him but I'm trusting in his grace thank you Lord oh God he said it's I've unmar it he said I make oh my come on he says I make thousands of mistakes each month each year surely I do but when I see that I'm wrong oh yeah I say God I didn't mean to do it you know my hearts I didn't mean to do that I was trapped into that I didn't mean to do it you forgive me Lord he said if I done wrong to my brother I say brother forgive me I didn't mean to do that he said there's the blood sacrifice there's the power of the Gospel that the holy church is moving on not because of something you done is something you had nothing to do with the atonement that's right so this life of daily repentance is is it's it's got to continue on Saints you can't sweep the floor once in 1974 you got to sweep that thing sisters come on now every day you got to keep cleaning on that thing you can't do the dishes once two years ago you got to do them stupid things every day even if you got paper plates you still got to was the silverware come on you you you can't just you can't just wash one load of clothes last month and say well I I washed this I washed this shirt already yeah come on it's got to be done every time it's used it's got to be done the floor got to be swept all the time the windows got to be cleaned all the time the clothes got to be washed all the time come on sisters after Paul became a Christian he said I Die daily that's right so we don't let the devil beat us up about that yeah it's the process that God's using that's right yeah it's good right repentance is a work of the holy ghost in a Believer that's right that's good right conviction is a work of the Holy Ghost aren you thank God you got it if it wasn't there you'd keep on going like you going but because he pricked in your heart because God's showing you things that ain't right you got the opport to make it right hallelujah thank you Lord see the woman at the blood issue had spent all of her living I love this s trying to get better 12 years she'd had the issue and and and but one day Jesus come by right thank you Lord and she said if I can just touch oh yeah the Hem of His Garment now look Saints you got to get down low to touch the the Hem of the garments you can't just be standing up well praise God I believe the message pray praise God I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ you got to get down low sometimes to Touch the Hem of the garments amen a full sheath of wheat bows yes and you got to get down low she got down low enough that she could touch the Hemm of the garments that's good see sometimes we got to get low to get somewhere with God on now is that right Saints come on it's good yes but I'll tell you this inside of him are attributes to be a Healer Amen to be a deliverer to be a savior to be a lord to be a god and the angels can't worship him that way only you can worship him oh the way he desires to be worshiped oh yeah only you an angel can't worship him as Savior because he never was lost but you can worship him as a savior because you were lost an angel can't worship him as a Healer because the angel ain't never been sick but you you can worship him as a Healer today an angel don't know what it's like to be hungry don't know what it's like to go without but you can know what it's like you can worship him as your provider right glory to God true yes all right now so conviction is not a sign that you're not a Believer but it's a work of the holy spirit in your life bringing you back into Perfection of the blood yeah he says now you talk Jehovah G says now you're talking about somewhere you think you've done a little something you can't get back from God now the devil uses this all the time you've gone too far you've done too much you've made too many mistakes you you backslid too many times you was in church before but now you got out and then you back in church and then you back out it's it's lost you're too done you're too far gone as long as there is a desire in your heart for more of Jesus Christ there's more of Jesus Christ to resp respond to that desire sir yeah you're blessed just to have the hunger and the thirst for righteousness that shows you there something in you pulling you drying you higher right thank you Lord very good yes sir true you're going to gone too far he said what about Abraham who lied about his wife he said he was backslid cuz any Jew that wasn't in Palestine was backslid and he said amch was a good man but God still came to him and said if you don't have my Prophet pray for you're as good as a dead man that's the seed of God remaining on you that's the Seed of Abraham Amen on see the message can't be done to you it's got to live through you you can't take a kid and do the message to them or a loved one that don't know the Lord and do the message to him that's a book of rules don't do this and don't do that and don't do this and don't that's trying to do the message to them it's got to live through them if you can get the message inside of them then they'll do the things the message says do on now come on see I I'm getting off subject here but you know the ma you know the word faith is in the Bible 247 times so that's for those of you asking that's Faith 24/7 that's what it's going to take Faith 247 it's in the message it's in the Bible 247 times it's only mentioned twice though in the Old Testament that's right and mentioned 245 times in the New Testament because our faith the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament was the atonement the blood sacrifice and the faith of us today has got to be in the atonement in the blood not in the man not in the pastor not in the church not in the bishop not in the general overseer but it's got to be in the blood it can't even be in the prophet it's got to be in the blood come on yeah right yeah and and and you think about faith Saints it's like the how many of you got how many of you got a favorite food somewhere favorite food brother Harvey what's your favorite food he likes it all he ain't no help at all sa his I ain't saying be of sausages how many of you like fried chicken oh God it's right let lunch time I'm preaching on fried chicken that's right in in order the Bible said that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence the evidence of Things Not Seen now in order for you I I if right now when I said that you said it's almost 12:00 and I leave at 12 brother George can preach as long as he wants to but 12 I'm leaving because I'm going to go get me some fried chicken because there's a desire in me for some fried chicken the desire that's in you for fried chicken is the evidence that Fried Chicken exists oh come on y'all going to get that in a minute you can't have a desire for something that don't exist the only way you can desire Fried Chicken brother Ben is if there's a piece of fried chicken somewhere it's the the desire that's in you is the evidence that it's there and you can't desire more of God in your life unless there's a God somewhere to respond to that [Applause] [Music] desire thank you Lord It's the evidence how do you know God's in it how do you know God's real cuz I feel him how do you know he's real cuz I want more of him cuz he's pulling on man oh I'm way off I'm way let me let me say it like this I'm just going to skip ahead here so we can close inside of Jesus now remember the first creation of God in the beginning was the word yeah and the first tangible creation of God was at logos the beginning of the creation go not not the beginning of God's creation but the beginning of God creating himself the beginning of God unfolding himself because in God were attributes and he had a desire to have fellowship with you and I come on he had a desire to he had a desire to be a Healer a desire to be a savior a desire to be a Lord but he was all by himself he was just God when did he start he never started how long's he been around he's always been where did it come from it didn't come from nowhere on that's right but the first part of God creating himself unfolding himself was the logos now if you want to see what that looks like we got a picture of it somewhere where it it it's the pillar of fire now is that right Saints the same one The Arc of the same one that led the children of Israel the same one that appeared over William brandham the same it was the logos in the beginning the first tangible creation of God on and inside of him were at but except from there outside of that come he just like a little white cloud and that was you that was man see you were your Beginnings are that logos you were in God in the beginning he said if you ever had eternal life you always had it now is that right and inside of inside of God were these attributes come on and and he he displayed them in the seven compound Redemptive names is that right yeah so so he was Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide he he was Jehovah RFI the Lord who heals he was Jehovah Nasi the Lord is my banner he was Jehovah Shalom the Lord is my peace he was Jehovah Rah the Lord is my shepherd He he was Jehovah tadu the Lord is our righteousness he was Jehovah sha the Lord is there see it was actually it was God displaying his personality his attributes to his people come on he had a desire so when you go to God and you ask God for things you have to know that you're asking him for things that he already wants to give you right if you ask God for your healing it's in his nature to want to heal you if you ask God to provide for you it's his nature to provide for you if you ask God to help you through a tough time it's his nature to be your Shield it's his nature to give you peace it's his nature to heal your body it's his to provide for you you're not asking God for something he don't want to do you're asking God for something that's his nature to do it thank you Lord that he's went to all links to do for you good but I want you to recognize that those seven compound Redemptive names they didn't they weren't given to us by God yeah come on they were given to us by man see the Bible said he brother Brown said he took stoop degraded men and he lifted them up to a place to become sons of God see it wasn't God it was Abraham after that Ram appeared that cried out Jehovah Gyra yeah that's right Abraham did that yeah God didn't do that God provided and in Abraham said Jehovah gar oh yeah now how did Abraham recognize that attribute of God because he was a part of God he was made out of the same stuff that God's made out of his nature was the same nature that God had and when he seen God he recognized that attribute it was Moses when he saw the victory that the lord gave him over the amalekites they rose up and built an altar and cried Jehovah D say the Lord is my banner now God didn't say that Moses said that well how did he recognize it because he recognize the God that was inside of him thank you Lord that's what we got to recognize that we are a part of God it was Gideon that was all upset because he was going to have to go Smite the midianites and the Lord told him I'm with you go ahead and do it and he he said you'll save all Israel he built an altar and he cried out than Jehovah Shalom the lord gave me peace it was David after all he'd been through after all his battles that cried out Jehovah Rah the Lord is my shepherd how did these mortal men recognize the attributes of God because they were a part of God how do you recognize God in this message how do you recognize God in this Bible how do you recognize God when you hear because you're a part of god good sir come on now yes sir he said the only real difference between us and the Son of God was that we just bypass our theophany come on come on he said he was from the very beginning the word yeah that's right he said that's how he could know all things he said but you bypass that and come here to be tempted come on now is that right and he said this body is not the word formed body but it's subject to the word this body is subject to the word and he says the difference between him and you as a son is he was at the beginning the word an a morphal body right come on and he said he appeared in the form of MDC and in then we didn't hear nothing about him no more because he came in Jesus Christ he said you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet right yet but there's coming a Time Saints there's coming an hour where you will he says you come like Adam like me you became from an attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly tab will be dissolved we have one already waiting there's an amorpha body already waiting on you Saints it's already there it's waiting on you and you may not understand that we don't understand these things but we know there's something more than what we're at right now we know there's something more that we're headed into we understand saints that there's a body calling to us and oh but I know it's there I can feel it I get a charge from it glory to God thank you Lord we're going back to what we was before the beginning oh yeah aren't you glad today it's waiting for us and we get a glimpse of it from time to time amen when you're in the presence of God when you're rejoicing in the things of God you can feel it calling to you right thank he said after you recognize the very word of God is Eagle food then you left off the other thing and you've been formed in the image of the Living God and you've heard from your theophany he said if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting right Saints I can't understand all that but I do know this he said the greatest as musicians come he said the greatest of all Revelation was the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ he says you you can't get to first base without it brother Ben on the Supreme de of the Lord Jesus Christ now I used to think for years that that meant Jesus was God well sure Jesus was God absolutely Jesus was God but that's not the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ see Supreme deity is it it's all Jesus Christ it's Jesus Christ in the prophets in the bible it was Jesus Christ in Isaiah Jesus Christ in Paul Jesus Christ in William brandom Jesus Christ came in his own body flesh and dwelt among us but it's Jesus Christ in you it's Jesus in your brother it's Jesus in your sister it's Jesus in the pastor it's Jesus in the Evangelist it's Jesus in the teacher it's Jesus in the ly it's Jesus functioning in the body you are the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ he's the one that controls all of this he's the one that's pushing and but the butt he's the one Saints that's orchestrating it all and if there's anything good about us it's him it's the deity of Christ oh thank you Lord working through the body of Jesus Christ he said the greatest the hardest thing on God was to get one mortal to believe another yes but God works through man God uses man come on God uses women God uses young people God uses old people God works through his body his Supreme deity working in you all aren't you glad for that today and Saints sees has a way that he brings us back into into the blood it's it's repentance it's it's it's it's it's it's condemnation it's conviction those are things that God is using to bring us back into the Perfection of the blood so don't let the devil use that against us recognize where you come from recognize where you're going to recognize what you are right now and realize it's all Jesus Christ thank you Lord thank you Lord thank God Jesus is in you condemning you thank God is in you convicting you thank God is in you working through you thank God he hadn't give up on you thank God he's still pulling thank God he's still lifting up thank God he's still raising up oh thank God you can get better thank God you
