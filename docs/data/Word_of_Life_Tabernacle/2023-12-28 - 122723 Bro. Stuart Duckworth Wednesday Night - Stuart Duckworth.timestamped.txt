[39:31] appreciate our brothers and the things
[39:33] they do for us we pray that God give
[39:35] them rest in their body
[39:38] amen just wanted to kind of continue our
[39:40] thought of redemption and uh such a
[39:43] wonderful thought you know you could you
[39:45] could preach that till the Rapture and
[39:47] uh if y'all get tired of it just let me
[39:49] know but there's so much there you think
[39:52] about Redemption and worship you it it's
[39:55] endless
[39:56] and so it's uh it's good for me I I I'm
[40:00] enjoying it myself and I just uh I hope
[40:04] you all are too sir amen Luke Chapter 2
[40:08] just the the spirit of Christmas here
[40:12] still and it should be a time of worship
[40:15] that's what Christmas is a a time of of
[40:18] thinking about the birth of our Lord
[40:20] Jesus and when he came the Angels were
[40:23] there to worship amen amen Luke chap 2
[40:28] and it came to pass in those days that
[40:30] there went out a decree from Caesar
[40:31] Augustus that all the world should be
[40:34] taxed and this taxing was first made by
[40:38] serenus the governor of Syria and all
[40:40] went to be taxed everyone in his own
[40:43] City and Joseph also went up From
[40:45] Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into
[40:47] Judea under the city of David which is
[40:50] called Bethlehem because he was of the
[40:52] house and lineage of David to be taxed
[40:55] with Mary's a spous wife being great
[40:57] with child and so it was that while they
[41:00] were there the days were accomplished
[41:02] that she should be delivered and she
[41:04] brought forth her firstborn son and
[41:06] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[41:08] laid him in a Manger because there was
[41:10] no room for them in the end anden you
[41:13] can be seated this
[41:17] evening 1949 brother brownon preaches a
[41:21] a sermon deity of Jesus Christ such a
[41:23] powerful
[41:24] Sermon Just continuing our thought of of
[41:27] redemption Jesus comes three times he
[41:30] said he came the first time to redeem
[41:32] his church he comes the second time to
[41:34] receive his church he comes the third
[41:37] time with his church he said but all in
[41:40] one in one Christ remember the first
[41:42] time to redeem his church second time to
[41:43] receive the third time he comes as
[41:46] Church King and Queen so he came he came
[41:49] to redeem that that was his his purpose
[41:52] of his first coming and so now we're
[41:55] looking for him to come come and receive
[41:57] us as the redeemed that's what we're
[41:59] waiting on right and and for those to
[42:03] receive those to receive the Redemption
[42:06] of Jesus Christ those that haven't
[42:08] received that yet and so until he comes
[42:11] again that work of redemption must
[42:14] continue right because because every
[42:17] name that's on that book must come not
[42:20] one's going to be left off not he's not
[42:22] going to lose a one but every name will
[42:24] come so that that work of redemption
[42:26] that Plan of Redemption is still going
[42:29] on so we must continue that message of
[42:34] redemption and what is redemption is to
[42:36] bring back to the its original position
[42:38] of what god of what God had in his mind
[42:42] before the world began even even past
[42:45] the Garden of Eden before the fall but
[42:47] but what God had in his mind of what we
[42:49] were and so how does he do that it's by
[42:53] the Plan of
[42:54] Redemption to D destroy what Satan had
[42:57] done to us and destroy the lie that was
[43:01] put on us by Adam and Eve and so last
[43:05] time we preached we preached on
[43:07] overcoming the lie and rejecting the LIE
[43:09] of Satan and that that's what we have to
[43:11] do we have to reject his thoughts reject
[43:14] what he says about us reject what we
[43:16] were reject our past and everything amen
[43:19] the blood of Jesus Christ has come amen
[43:21] there's power in the blood to destroy
[43:24] that sin to destroy the Li of Satan that
[43:27] was put upon
[43:29] us and so brother randam we've said it
[43:31] before the prophet said Adam put you in
[43:34] the devil's Pawn shot but Jesus came and
[43:37] paid the price that God required to
[43:40] bring you out amen that that's what uh
[43:42] that's what a baby was to me and and
[43:44] brother brandham goes on to say we're
[43:46] not worshiping a baby in a Manger
[43:47] anymore though though we looked at that
[43:49] but we're worshiping almighty God in the
[43:52] in that in in that baby was the blood
[43:55] was the power was the DNA Amen to
[43:58] destroy the Devil to destroy sickness to
[44:00] destroy
[44:05] sin and as we go on here in the deed of
[44:08] Jesus Christ now in these days there was
[44:10] a great persecution he says against the
[44:12] church Caesar Augusta had made a great
[44:14] plan that he would tax all the people
[44:17] and he says and that was only done for
[44:19] one purpose that God's Great prophecy
[44:22] would be fulfilled so Joseph and Mary
[44:25] they couldn't just stay where they're at
[44:26] they had to be in a certain spot they
[44:28] had to be in a certain place a
[44:30] predestinated place and so you think
[44:34] about that that you know no doubt that
[44:36] that was uh that was frustrating it was
[44:39] it was uh aggravating to have to have to
[44:42] get up and you know your your spouse
[44:45] wife here she's not even your wife yet
[44:47] and you know no doubt you've heard it
[44:49] from this one and that one and and you
[44:51] got to get up and move you got to take
[44:52] her and she's almost you know ready to
[44:55] to to to have this
[44:58] child but God makes everything work
[45:01] according to his plan his purpose anden
[45:04] he will allow times of persecution times
[45:06] of pressure and Circumstance he will
[45:09] allow hard times to bring his people
[45:11] into the place where his word can be
[45:13] fulfilled do you believe that and God's
[45:16] predestinated plan won't fail God is a
[45:19] predestinated time and season for every
[45:22] purpose and a plan he has ordained to be
[45:25] married Mary didn't want to be on that
[45:27] Journey she didn't being with child she
[45:30] didn't want to be on that Journey but
[45:31] but there was a purpose and the birth of
[45:34] Jesus was for a predestinated place and
[45:37] even now here this evening here now it's
[45:40] it's a predestinated people that will
[45:43] receive his word into their hearts do
[45:46] you believe
[45:48] that no doubt she was troubled they were
[45:51] troubled by by having to do this but God
[45:54] had already told her
[45:56] the angel had already told Mary that she
[45:58] was highly favored before all this don't
[46:01] be afraid he said You shall conceive and
[46:04] bear a son and call his name
[46:06] Jesus therefore the Lord shall give you
[46:09] a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive
[46:11] and bear a son and shall call his name
[46:13] Emanuel he told her she was highly
[46:16] favored and so it's the word that holds
[46:20] us down that that that that gives us an
[46:23] assurance that when when trouble arises
[46:26] when when things aren't going the right
[46:28] way God has already made a promise we've
[46:30] already heard from the angel but what
[46:33] we've got to do we've got to take that
[46:34] word into our heart and no matter what
[46:37] comes and goes amen we've got to carry
[46:39] that that word of God within us and it
[46:41] will bring us Amen to that place that we
[46:43] need to be that that predestinated
[46:48] place he already told her she was highly
[46:51] favored told her she was highly favored
[46:53] how will I do this and the angel
[46:55] answered and the the Holy Ghost shall
[46:57] come upon thee and the power of the
[46:59] highest shall overshadow overshadow thee
[47:02] therefore also that Holy thing which is
[47:04] shall be born of thee shall be called
[47:07] The Son of God Amen so on her journey
[47:10] she kept these things within her amen
[47:12] she told the angel be it unto me
[47:15] according to Thy word and that's what
[47:17] we've got to do we we take that word
[47:19] within us we take that word within us
[47:21] and that's God in you that's God in you
[47:24] that's deity that's the that's the deity
[47:26] of God in you that we're carrying when
[47:29] we take the word of
[47:31] God simple tonight and we got a long way
[47:35] to go so y'all amen me not very many of
[47:37] us
[47:39] here but praise the
[47:41] Lord praise the Lord God makes
[47:45] everything work out do you believe that
[47:47] amen so he goes on to hear in that same
[47:49] message God is in no hurry we're the
[47:50] ones that get in a hurry just give God a
[47:53] little bit of time and you'll see the
[47:54] old prophetic Wheels cogs run right up
[47:57] in the in the picture it'll develop just
[48:00] like bringing up of a
[48:02] picture and where that woman was going
[48:05] where where God was bringing her was a
[48:07] place of fulfillment of Prophecy a place
[48:10] of fulfillment of scripture and when
[48:12] things don't don't aren't working like
[48:15] we think they should we should still
[48:16] believe that God we we should believe
[48:18] that God's got it all in control that
[48:20] he'll bring his word to pass right yes
[48:23] sir and to think of all the scripture
[48:25] that was about to be fulfilled all the
[48:27] trouble that Joseph and Mary had to go
[48:29] through to get where they needed to
[48:31] be right they were going along they had
[48:34] to travel back it was crowded everywhere
[48:36] nowhere to stay nowhere to
[48:40] go but there was a place that God had
[48:43] for his word to be fulfilled amen it
[48:45] bypasses the greatness of the world it
[48:48] goes to where it will be received it
[48:51] goes to where there will be worship amen
[48:54] God goes It goes to to a place amen it's
[48:56] got someone it goes to someone who will
[48:59] believe
[49:02] it and that same message there God he
[49:05] said God what was he when he was back
[49:06] Yonder millions and millions of years
[49:08] ago when he was there just no space here
[49:10] when he gathered up into the logos and
[49:13] then he came from the logos down into
[49:15] Christ down into that baby and see it's
[49:18] just God coming down like this to the
[49:20] Earth and going right back to God again
[49:23] don't you see what I mean he said just
[49:25] revolve coming down from space from
[49:27] eternity rolling down coming down into
[49:30] the lost from the Lost there into man
[49:33] then returning back again for one
[49:35] purpose to redeem that man that had
[49:38] fallen that was why God Amen moved upon
[49:40] a little virgin Amen to bring forth a
[49:43] son amen that would be a savior that
[49:45] would be a redeemer amen amen he did The
[49:49] Impossible he did The Impossible how
[49:52] could you even fathom that but God
[49:54] interprets his own word he interprets it
[49:56] by bringing it to
[49:59] pass amen so God came for one purpose in
[50:02] that little child to redeem you and I to
[50:06] redeem Humanity had fallen but we see
[50:09] here the god of creation there he come
[50:11] from the logos and we know from that God
[50:14] begin to create he begin to speak he
[50:16] begin to to to express his thoughts and
[50:19] and there there uh he dwelt alone with
[50:22] his thoughts the prophet said and there
[50:24] he spoke and there was no one there to
[50:26] believe his word but he said so God
[50:29] believed his own word and it came to be
[50:32] amen and so that's what you that's what
[50:34] we've got to be and and we're we're
[50:36] we're looking at the message of the
[50:37] deity of Jesus Christ amen and don't
[50:40] don't put it way off here or way out
[50:42] there or way up in heaven y but if the
[50:45] words in you then deity is in you and it
[50:47] will bring forth Jesus Christ it may
[50:50] this this church it may seem like a we
[50:53] bypassed everything we bypassed all the
[50:55] the greatness and we've come here and
[50:57] how in the world are we here why in the
[50:58] world are we in we in Hardy Arkansas or
[51:01] pigy amen but God's got a people to
[51:03] receive his word he's got a place a
[51:05] predestinated place amen and and we
[51:08] don't seem like much we're not much
[51:10] we're nothing but God bypassed everyone
[51:13] else and he sent you his
[51:16] word amen that it could be born within
[51:18] us that we could bring forth Jesus
[51:21] Christ that we that we would have deity
[51:23] within us that's right
[51:27] so there he dwelt alone with his
[51:29] thoughts he he believed he spoke his
[51:32] word he believed his his own word and it
[51:35] came to be and so brother Rand said the
[51:39] first thing that he created was angels
[51:41] to worship him that he said that made
[51:43] him God and St John one in the beginning
[51:46] was the word and the Word was with God
[51:48] and the Word was God and the Word was
[51:50] made flesh and dwelt Among Us Amen to
[51:54] express his attributes to express who he
[51:56] was that God the god that dwelt alone
[51:59] with his thoughts that he had thoughts
[52:01] to be a savior to be a Healer to be a
[52:04] redeemer the god that allowed the fall
[52:06] to happen so he could come in flesh in
[52:09] Jesus Christ and express to you and I
[52:12] amen who he was as a savior amen as a
[52:15] deliverer amen do we know him is that
[52:17] this evening do we know him amen we were
[52:19] bound we were we were caught up in the
[52:21] things of the world and amen we were
[52:23] just we were enjoying the pleasure of
[52:25] sin and so forth amen but we were lost
[52:28] we were bound but a god Came Upon the
[52:30] scene why because Jesus Christ came amen
[52:34] and expressed himself as a savior as a
[52:38] Healer and we could partake of that
[52:41] because it's Everlasting it wasn't just
[52:43] for those people at that time but it's
[52:45] here for us now amen it wasn't just for
[52:48] old Bible days amen but we can we can
[52:50] partake amen of that God Amen of that
[52:54] deity that was was
[52:56] expressed I'm trying to preach my heart
[52:58] out here this
[53:02] evening so he came he came for one
[53:05] purpose he came from the heavenlies he
[53:07] came down from the logos he came down
[53:10] from the eternities he came down in
[53:12] flesh for one purpose to redeem you and
[53:14] I that had fallen to bring us back to
[53:17] the spiritual relationship that Adam and
[53:20] Eve sold us out
[53:21] for to bring us back to a fellowship and
[53:25] a true worship of almighty God Amen and
[53:28] to those that th those that believe on
[53:30] his name in this hour he will give you
[53:32] power he will give you power to become
[53:35] the deity in flesh amen power to become
[53:37] sons of
[53:41] God Colossians 1 and
[53:44] 16 in whom we have Redemption through
[53:47] his blood even the Forgiveness of sins
[53:50] who is the image of the invisible God
[53:52] the firstborn of every creature for by
[53:55] him were all things created that are in
[53:58] heaven and that are in Earth visible and
[54:00] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[54:02] dominions or principalities or Powers
[54:05] all things were created by Him and for
[54:08] him and he is before all things and by
[54:11] him all things consist and brother Bram
[54:15] says here he said the the man that lost
[54:16] his origin in the Garden of Eden his
[54:18] relationship communion with God was cut
[54:21] off there because of sin and unbelief
[54:23] unbelief in what the word of God and a
[54:26] picture was painted one time to Eve and
[54:28] told her how much brighter it would be
[54:30] if she just discard the word of God and
[54:33] look over here to reason see Adam and
[54:36] Eve were created for Fellowship but the
[54:38] LIE of the devil came in amen and we've
[54:41] got to put the word of God above our
[54:43] opinion we've got to put it above any
[54:45] any type of reasoning that would come in
[54:47] because because that's what got us in
[54:49] this trouble to begin with and there's
[54:51] got to be a people that take the word of
[54:53] God in their heart and says be unto me I
[54:56] reject what the world says about me I
[54:58] reject what the world says about the
[55:00] gospel I reject what the world and how
[55:02] they try to be little amen the power of
[55:05] God Amen I know the power of God is real
[55:07] I accept that word into my heart be it
[55:10] unto me Lorden Let Jesus be born in my
[55:15] life we were created for Fellowship we
[55:19] were created to worship and have
[55:21] communion with Jehovah yeah they fell
[55:23] from Dominion they fell from that place
[55:26] from that worship by
[55:29] reasoning amen Adam sold us out Adam and
[55:31] Eve sold us
[55:33] out and
[55:37] so we look
[55:41] here so he came to redeem us to redeem
[55:44] Fallen man to redeem us redeem us from
[55:46] what they sold us out for so we look at
[55:50] Adam and Eve they tried to cover their
[55:51] sin on their own but it didn't hide what
[55:54] what had been done from the very
[55:57] beginning God required blood because in
[55:59] God's mind there was a lamb slain from
[56:01] the foundation of the world and so he
[56:04] came down God came down and gave them a
[56:07] covering of sheep skin he gave them
[56:09] their amen there the first message that
[56:12] that God that God would preach amen
[56:14] there there they would they would be
[56:16] covered in in Blood and sheep skin they
[56:18] would hear that message amen you've got
[56:20] to go out but I'll I'll make a way of
[56:23] return one day I I'll make a way of
[56:25] return where you can come back and have
[56:27] that Fellowship
[56:30] sir and so they're walking out covered
[56:32] in blood covered in those
[56:35] skins
[56:37] amen and according to God's law there
[56:39] had to be a Kinsman to bring it back
[56:42] right preach with me here this evening
[56:45] and that was a law that was given by
[56:47] Moses of redemption that had to be a
[56:49] kinsman redeemer there had to be one
[56:51] that was worthy to come one who was able
[56:54] to pay the price one who was able to to
[56:58] redeem and to bring back right one that
[57:01] that could bring back the Lost estate of
[57:03] of someone that had fallen there had to
[57:04] be someone worthy that could come forth
[57:08] and he said God was worthy no man was
[57:10] worthy God was worthy he came down some
[57:13] 1900 years ago in the form of a baby
[57:16] born in a manger overshadowed by the
[57:18] Holy Ghost not born by sexual desire he
[57:22] was God and God's blood was in him amen
[57:25] it was a creative blood it was something
[57:28] not not from man's hands it it wasn't it
[57:31] wasn't it wasn't mixed with man's blood
[57:33] but it was a creative it was a power a
[57:36] creative God the god that that created
[57:38] the universe the god that created you
[57:40] and I that God come down in the womb of
[57:43] a virgin amen and he brought forth a
[57:45] blood he brought forth a blood cell that
[57:48] produced amen a sin killing agent he
[57:50] brought forth something amen that would
[57:52] bring us back yes sir someone that could
[57:55] defeat the enemy someone that could that
[57:58] where where where we couldn't he
[58:02] could and so we looked at Ruth and Boaz
[58:06] just a little
[58:07] bit a while back but this
[58:11] Redeemer he had to be worthy he had to
[58:14] be be able to pay the price and so Boaz
[58:17] had to come forth to be able to redeem
[58:19] redeem Naomi to redeem her estate he had
[58:22] to be a mighty man of wealth and he had
[58:24] to make a public testimony of that so
[58:27] Boaz come forth amen and said who else
[58:31] who else will redeem who else will
[58:33] redeem the Lost state of Naomi and there
[58:36] was a Kinsman there was one that stepped
[58:38] forward but he didn't want to take on
[58:41] Ruth he said no I can't do that so this
[58:44] Mighty Man of wealth there he St he
[58:46] slammed his his shoe down amen as a as a
[58:49] public testimony and said I will redeem
[58:52] I will pay the price and I will bring
[58:53] back and many he had to make a public
[58:56] testimony it couldn't be something that
[58:58] was done in secret it had to be done in
[59:00] open so our lord Jesus when he came as a
[59:03] redeemer he had to make a public
[59:05] testimony and Isaiah 53 says surely he
[59:08] had borne our griefs and carried our
[59:10] sorrows yet we did a stream him stricken
[59:14] smitten of God and Afflicted amen there
[59:16] is public testimony he was wounded amen
[59:19] for my transgressions he was bruised for
[59:22] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[59:24] peace was upon him and with the strapes
[59:26] we were healed amen he went to Calvary
[59:29] amen he didn't have to go but he went he
[59:31] took you and I amen we were on his mind
[59:34] amen that's what pushed him through amen
[59:37] and he made that public testimony amen I
[59:40] have redeemed them I it is finished
[59:42] anden the devil will no longer have
[59:44] control over their lives amen devil

[1:07:52] the father was amen it was God's gift of

[1:07:59] brother brandham says when when Divine
[1:08:01] love is projected Sovereign Grace takes
[1:08:03] over and when God so loved the world
[1:08:05] God's Divine love to Adam's race when he
[1:08:07] so loved it Christ stepped out and
[1:08:10] Sovereign Grace took its place God's
[1:08:12] love was met by Sovereign Grace God gave
[1:08:16] His only begotten son so Christ God gave
[1:08:18] his son Christ was was the very heart of
