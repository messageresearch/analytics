speak Lord as only you can to your people we pray in Jesus name amen thank the Lord thank the Lord let good to be back with you tonight we just always enjoy being here on a on a Wednesday night and uh know where else I'd rather be preaching than right here for you folks I've been looking forward to this service to be back we had a good time while we were gone but it's always good to be back and together with you home folks we're going to read from Genesis 39 Genesis 391 and2 and uh we get back into our series on Joseph who was an almost perfect man an almost perfect type of Christ and yet he suffered many things tonight we're going to talk about a prosperous man Genesis 39:1 Joseph was brought down to Egypt and potier an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down thither and the Lord was with Joseph and he he was a prosperous man and he he was in the house of his master the Egyptian pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated if the things that you own are a good measure of prosperity then you could not call Joseph A prosperous man he didn't own anything as a slave if you don't own property you are owned and so he had been sold into slavery and he was no longer considered a land owner or an owner of sheep or of cattle or able to inherit or do any of those things because he was a slave but the thing about Joseph is that no matter where you put him no matter what the conditions were he ended up being the winner he just want of them guys that just seem like they always ended up being the winner have you ever played a board game with somebody like that it didn't matter if they'd never played before or or or if they didn't know anything about the rules and you get to the end of the game they won and it's just always the way that it is you get you get through it and and they won and Joseph was that guy he just always turned up he's like a uh he he's like something a cat that'll just always land on its feet and and so Joseph always ended up up on his feet that wasn't because of his even his abilities as a human being but that's because he was chosen by God to be a type of Christ and we have been chosen by God to be uh to be Christ to be to represent Christ in the world that we live in now we know that Prosperity is not being a person with no opposition but Prosperity is being a person who overcomes opposition the word the word that Hebrew word for Prosperity is literally to go over or through as a river so in other words if there's an obstacle in the way if you have water it'll find a way or if you're coming to a body of water once you pass it that's Prosperity you've passed it but a river if you think about it as a river it's it's flowing and it's finding a way and anything that put that you put in its way if there's enough water it's going to overcome it so you you can build a dam and the water will go over it you can uh you can put something in this way it'll go around it or go under it or it'll cut through it no matter what's in its way the water prospers or it continues on its way that word is also used to attack or or to fall on it's used the spirit of Jehovah falling Upon A man so it's a it finds a way the spirit of God finds a way to Pro prosper in other words it's going to prove it's going to do what it was intended to do we know that a man or a woman and that's all of us here today we either men or women we've been chosen by God for a particular purpose and I believe all of us have that because we're chosen by God to be the bride our purpose will not fail it cannot fail because God chose us for that that gives me great comfort because many times I look at myself as a failure I might look at somebody else and say well they don't seem like they're able but the water finds a way they will be prosperous because of who they are not because of what uh what gifts they have or what kind of person they are but because God chose them so we know that I'm going to have to slow down here a little bit we know elaser was sent by Abraham with a purpose and his purpose was to find Isaac a wife and the Bible says he prospered in that in fact he told her family he said unto them hinder me not seeing the Lord hath prospered my way send me a way that I may go to my master it's that same word that we found a way he didn't know how it was going to happen in fact he got down on his knees he said Lord he said if you'll only uh let allow this certain things to happen and and the girl that comes out at a certain time and feeds the camels and let that be my prosperity and so he said said now the Lord has prospered my way and I want you to know that he was successful in bringing the right woman to the right man and I believe that in this hour we've had an elaser we've had somebody that stood up and and and and preached the message to us and and what he did what was he doing he was calling a bride and and God's servant was prosperous in doing that I don't believe he failed at his mission but I believe we're the result of that prosperity of the message so the reason the message is prosperous today is because God's servant was chosen to do a particular task we have prosperity in Joseph's life but it doesn't always look at what we would think of as Prosperity doesn't always look like that in Genesis 39 and3 it says his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hands now think You' got a a big house a house full of slaves so there's there's all kinds of servants served in Piper's house he's a a a man who's very close to the throne he's a captain of the guard and so Piper is a very rich man a very wealthy man very powerful man and so he uh he he chose Joseph as a slave remember Joseph is 17 years old and he gets taken into into slavery he ends up in this big house and somehow his star rises above all the others because and and maybe we don't know how hard he worked or anything like that but God just caused what he did to prosper it says the the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand so in other words when Joseph did it it was it was more blessed than when somebody else did it and you may not realize it today but whatever you're doing God can prosper that it may not look like prosperity to others you may feel like you're even in a in a dead in job but whatever you do whatever you put your hand to you're a son or a daughter of prosperity and God can prosper that now he said and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house so he moves up into a management position in the company if we could put it like that and all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass from the time that he had made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake oh I remember brother Stuart I think it was brother Ivy used to tell us God will bless your boss for employing you and I believe that's the truth that that when we work somewhere God will bless even our even our boss even the community that we live in even it'll be blessed brother Joe even a even a funeral home is blessed cuz you're there and even even wherever it is that you work it's blessed because you work there so I don't think we should hide oursel from the community I think we ought to work I think we ought to go out and and be a part of the community and be a part of of the world oh it's it's bad there's enough bad people out there there's enough people that don't pay their taxes there's enough people that that that ride in the streets there's enough people that steal and kill and destroy let's be a people who are a credit to the society that we live in let's be somebody that can be a credit if anybody can be a credit to society if anybody can be a good citizen that ought to be a Christian so the Lord blessed the Egyptians house and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and all that he had in the field and he left all that he had in Joseph's hand and he knew not thought he had save the bread which he did eat so in other words Joseph was responsible for everything in Piper's house and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored now we know that when you are prosperous in what God has done for you look for the devil yeah come on now right to try to tempt you out of that Prosperity right he's going to try to take you out of that and many times gifted people and talented people are tempted out of that by the devil and so but we've got to have a character to be able to stand that Temptation so remember again I keep stressing this point but it's important Joseph has to grow up during this time and when he first goes to Piper's house he's 17 years old we don't know how old he was at the time that this happened but we know that he wasn't an old man because he was only 30 when he went to the throne so he was a young man and I don't want to pick on young men tonight and we're just going to go through this briefly and we'll move on cuz I got something else I want to say but young men are more prone to this temptation than old men and all the old men can say Amen wow I didn't go very far thank you brother Caleb and so when when Joseph was sold into slavery 17 years old so he's not very old maybe sometime in his 20s verse 7 it came to pass after these things he was prosperous that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me that's pretty Brazen but it would have been normal behavior in Egypt normal isn't right I want you young people to understand that you young men what I want to challenge you with that whether you're here or sitting in the back wherever you normal isn't right just because Normal boyfriends do that to their girlfriends don't make it right for you just because Normal girlfriends and boyfriends or fian or everybody wants to do just whatever they want to do well I saw it on a movie well that don't make it right I saw some other message Church did it that don't make it right we got to abide by the word don't go by what's normal the world the normal world's going to hell the normal world's going to end up in the wrong place the normal family is broken up the normal person is stressed out and in chaos all the time I don't want to be normal I want to be something different from normal I want to challenge you young people don't be normal don't be like everybody else be like the word be like Christ this would have been normal behavior but this is not normal behavior he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master WTH not what is with me in the house and he has committed all that he has to my hands so in other words he says I have a responsibility sir I have a responsibility there's none greater in this house than I neither ha he kept back anything from me but thee because thou are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God so it's Integrity doing the right thing for the right reasons right but she didn't quit and the devil didn't quit yeah and if you're tempted you'll continue to be tempted and I I'll say this and cuz I didn't get much response for the older one saying it gets better and I I do know that it doesn't go away Temptation continues and I've seen old men that fall in the same way Genesis 3910 came to pass that she spake to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her Oh my he didn't give in any right and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and watch what happened so the devil is going to set a trap for him all right cuz he can't get him to give in by just directly coming to him like that so he's going to set a trap for him you got to watch out for those traps right ID is a trap of the devil and and it's not good for a man to be idle a man needs to work and because idleness is a trap that the devil sets and even stress can be a trap right right and even maybe you you get in a fight with your wife or you get in a fight with somebody at work and then you're just all that can be a trap and that's when the devil tries to move in and tempt you in that moment now Joseph this trap was that there was none of the men of the house there within so it was an opportunity for something to happen or for a lie to be told right so the best way to keep our integrity again I'm not preaching on this tonight but I got to go through it because it's what I've approached in in Joseph we got to tell this part of his life too right to declare the whole gospel so the best way to keep your integrity is to limit opportunities for Temptation right and so brother Baron talks about many times he said I go to houses and there's women standing out there and I go to the house and knock on the door and a sister would come to the door come in brother Brandon if her husband's not there unless it's a case of sickness and somebody with me I don't go right right so we got to limit that and you say brother Ben who you preaching at I'm preaching at me right you say well that's pretty that's pretty strong well I recognize that I'm human and so are you right if you don't know that you're going to find it out one day I think of you know brother B talked about that was his policy and he goes on to tell ministers that it should be their policy and doing that and taking sides with Jesus Billy Graham was known for his moral Integrity the reason was is because he protected himself he had a rule that stated that the man of God will not be alone with a woman other than his wife or a relative a close relative he will not share meals with a woman alone will not counsel a woman alone will not go places with a woman alone and Mike Pence you remember here a few years ago uh he come out with that that same thing the vice president at the time and and said that was their rule in their marriage and people ridiculed him and mocked him and laughed at him but I guarantee you'll have a lot less trouble than some of these other guys right that don't have that rule see because we all have to deal with that every man especially every young man is going to deal with that but you've been G you've been called to Prosperity so I don't want this to be discouraging tonight I want you to understand you've been called to something you've been called for the river to find a way you've been called for it to overcome the obstacle and Joseph was called to that and to deal with it he said well I made a mistake deal with it and move on because you're going to be prosperous God called you to be yes all right and so so she caught him by His Garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled what did he do he ran and got him out you want to know how to deal with Temptation This is how to deal with it right here don't try to be a big man and say in there and say well I'll just resist the devil yeah you can resist the devil and he'll flee from you but every place in the scripture says to flee from this specific thing flee from it I lose my my mic feel like I lost my mic completely because I didn't change the battery it says flee from it now 1 Corinthians 618 flee fornication 2 Timothy 2:22 flee youthful lust in other words run right run why brother brother Ben I don't need to you know I've gotten older and I can just hang out with women it don't bother me a bit flee but now I want you to understand I want our young people espe to understand it's not a sin to be tempted right and how do we know that because we have a we have a high priest which not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points someone say all points tempted see Joseph was a type right of Christ and Christ was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin yeah we overcome we have to overcome that's what the river does it's got to overcome and we overcome by humility oh my by humility brother BR says this he saides Jesus told us how to do it he overcome overcome means to stand the test he said that's right like all the old Saints did like Jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness him being oh church are you with me tonight him being Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself do you see what I'm talking about there's a way to overcome you don't have to give in it right Why by the word said you destroy this Temple I'll raise it up in three days the word said so and in the presence of death he defeated it he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell in the presence of the Grave he overcome the grave why all by the word and humility where does humility come in brother Ben humility and understanding I'm a human being and I could mess up I could do something wrong so I'm going to overcome I'm going to keep the word that says shield around me and I'm going to believe what God Said and do what God said I'm not going to get arrogant and say it couldn't happen to me right look what he says he said in the presence of death he defeated he defeated hell he defeated everything he said there's the real man there's the one to make your example oh my look at this quote look Temptation was for him yeah he said you know that the Bible said he was tempted are are y'all listening are you young people listening Temptation was for him the Bible said he was tempted in all some say all when he was a young man he might have been tempted to cheat on his test boy got quiet you don't believe Jesus was tempted absolutely was he might have been tempted to steal candy and lie to his mother are you with me now now he never did it right yeah cuz he never sinned but he was tempted the devil tempted him are you with me now he was tempted at all points as we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking yeah huh that's right he was tempted by women I know that's hard for us to believe but it's true it's not a sin to be tempted it's what you do with that he was tempted by everything he could be tempted by he was tempted by everything someone say everything that we are he was a man yet you couldn't put a mark on him and so brother random goes on and this is a famous quote but I think sometimes we don't read the context but this is how you recognize the devil he said overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks oh my a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he just as real as you are anybody a real devil you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you and to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier how many believe that tonight he's greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him he was tempted like you are he already overcome Temptation he already overcome lust he already overcome the Temptation for money he already overcome every Temptation that you face right yes and by his grace you are more someone say more you're more than a match for him there's real overcoming when you re oh God help me to recognize that I am more than a match for him when I come under the word under the word of humility There's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that now watch you can't look at it like this number one you're under condemnation cuz you're you're living like that but then you can't dwell on it once you've repented he said you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that no you're defeated all right but there's no condemnation oh Hallelujah right aren't you glad for the blood tonight there's no condemnation to them which you're in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize you've overcome yes that builds strength for the next battle don't dwell on it don't spend the rest of your life thinking about it flee run overcome you see Paul understood who he was without Christ in Romans 7:24 oh Wretched Man that I am who should deliver me from the body of this death he's talking about his own flesh verse 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so it's not a hopeless case it's not that you say well I've just got something in me that makes me want to steal or makes me want to uh smoke or makes me want to drink that's not what it is at all you're not a hopeless case this all of our flesh is that way all of our flesh is subject to temptation all of our flesh is able to be overcome by the enemy but I'm glad that I'm not depending on the flesh but I'm depending on the life of the spirit inside of me Oh my he said I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I serve the law of God but I understand that my flesh still serves the law of sin yeah you understand that's why a person can do things and never be the same but they could be as forgiven as everything right forgiven as anybody else but the flesh serves the law of sin but the soul is pure I'm so glad when we tie knots it can't be untied that there still could be a clear line between us and God and we're as saved as anybody else is right so on a positive side I'm glad of that but I would warn you don't don't do that because what happens is the flesh still serves the law of sin you always have that memory look he said that I know my flesh is still a sinner yeah right he said I've got to do something about it so what do he say I keep under my body bring it into subjection let by any means when I preach to others I myself should be a cast away oh if Paul had that kind of humility let me have that kind of humility Paul had the Holy Ghost how many believe that I've heard people say well if you have the Holy Ghost you'll you'll you just automatically never give in to Temptation okay that's not overcoming you say how how do you know that well brother brandham had the Holy Ghost in fact he said it this way I you all already looking at it he said I've had the Holy Ghost for years I think he was right about that I'll take his word for it he said you can't look at a woman her half-dressed he said I carry a little cross in my car many of you seen it somebody said to me are you a Catholic where do the Catholics ever get an option on the cross the cross means Christian he said the other day Friday wife and I was going to the store I don't mean to harp on this as we went down the street I just kept turning my head one way or the other for naked women he said I promis God one way for the other he said naked women so he'd see one he'd have to turn his head he said I promised God I was a blind man if he'd heal my eyes I'd look at the thing that was right I keep a little cross hanging in my car when I see such a that I look at the cross and I say oh God that's my refuge I'm not looking at my own self I'm looking at the cross that's my refuge now we know that when Joseph did the right thing as we're moving along now it didn't go well for him You' have thought he'd been rewarded for for overcoming but he immediately gets thrown back in the pit back into prison yeah have his Liberty taken away after he's gained all that he's gained during this time it's all stripped away from him and he finds himself in prison falsely accused of assaulting a woman that was assaulting him and he ended up in prison oh my I'll say this he was falsely accused he was a type of Christ how many times are we falsely accused maybe once in a while mostly we did it come on church mostly we did it but I'm so glad for the grace of God that that's not the end of the story right that's not the end come on church that's not the end I don't believe in legalism without hope I believe in Holiness but I don't believe in legalism without hope I believe there's hope for the vest sinner in the blood of Jesus Christ as brother brand told the story of the woman who who had so dirty that they wouldn't even touch her and they they rode her out on a rail and tarred and feathered her and and and she had done so many unspeakable acts the woman in Oklahoma and he said told the story he said a preacher stood up among all the religions of the world he said which of your religions can clean the hands of Lady mcabe and they all sat there and he said he said he jumped up and clicked his heels and he said my the he said My Religion my gospel he said will not only clean her hands it'll clean her heart and make her so she never did it in the first place oh I believe in a god like that here you find the almost perfect type of Christ was sitting in a prison falsely accused Jesus was too but there was prosperity in the prison it says Joseph's Master took him and put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him Mercy aren't you glad he showed you mercy and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it you realize what it is no matter where Joseph is he's in charge no matter listen Church you're not a victim of your circumstances you're not a victim of the economy you're not a victim of what people say about you you're not a your your type is Christ it's Joseph no matter where he went he was an overcomer he went to hell and overcame hell he went to the Grave overcame the grave listen if brother brother Bill if one of these days you pass on remember you're an overcomer you'll come up before we do oh church we are not bound you say well I'm getting old and I can't do nothing no more but there's coming a resurrection Satan can't put you in a place you can't get out of he can't block up the river he can't bring he can't shut you down come on now oh hope we can understand that today I'm a testimony that I wonder how many other testimonies we got here tonight Satan can't keep me down I belong to God I'm a son of prosperity sir good yes the Bible says The Keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand look how similar the story is Joseph lied on put in prison he ends up in the same spot he was that that and because the Lord was with him that which he did the Lord made it to prosper different jobs same story different circumstances same story are you with me now Joseph was a son of prosperity a type of Jesus Christ brother brand said remember he was a son of prosperity he said everything he did prospered whether it was prison wherever it was to come out right and hasn't he promised for his children that he'd make everything work together for the good he said whether it was sickness prison house death Sorrows whatever it was it would work for the good to them that loved him he promised it it must be so it's got to be there he said it's figurative spoke to us in him oh there's a great Revelation there when he when he overcame he was speaking to us you can overcome Oh my he said I'm I live so that you could live also overcome death Hell In The Grave he said he had to KY Keys why did he have the keys so we could unlock it for us it spoke to us in him he was the perfect image of God I'm going to go back to Psalm 1 we've dealt with that a little bit but I want to go back there look at a little differently he said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord in his law do he meditate day and night he loves the word oh that God would put a love for the word back in our hearts again oh that we could we could recogn as message people we ought to love the word like nobody else yes his Delight is in the law of the Lord in his La do he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water remember we talked about being planted predestinated to be there planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever ever he doeth shall prosper Hallelujah whatsoever he doeth he so he's not limiting it to Joseph he's saying every one of you have the ability to prosper whatever you do come on church it's a Wednesday night I know but whatever you do he said I've given you the ability to prosper in it he said Joseph he said think of that Perfect Tree David looked back and saw it he said a standing by the rivers of water he bringeth forth his leaves in his season in his fruit it shall not be cast it won't wither whatsoever he doth shall prosper he was the son of prosperity Joseph was a type of him he was the antitype of Joseph everywhere Joseph went it prospered same thing with Jesus his word watch where he takes it what prospers the word remember what he we read about Joseph he said until his the day his word came the word of God tried him right the word of God tried him but his word was what was prosperous right hallelujah what was prosperous in his life was the vision what was prosperous in his life was the word what is prosperous in your life you may not you may not have a lot of money but what prospers in your life you're going to make it to that place why because he planted you Hallelujah by the rivers of water he placed his word in you he said you're not going to fail you're going to make it yes sir right Hallelujah he said same thing with Jesus his my word will prosper and it won't return to me void it'll accomplish that which I purposed it for he said he was the word the word was sent to the Earth by God and it will accomplish exactly someone say exactly what God sent it for Hallelujah listen to this there's a there's a tie between prosperity and the word and I want to kind of enter into that because maybe Sunday morning we'll talk about the value of the word and the things that we've been given and and and the word that we have the word itself what that is because he says you keep therefore the words of this Covenant and do them that you may prosper in all that you do there's a tie between the word and prosperity listen to me young people if you'll stay with the word if you'll just see say well I won't do that because the word says not to and I won't do that and really what it comes down to you got to have a love for the word it won't be just a Dos or a don'ts it won't be just a law but there's something inside of you that loves the word and you say I love him I don't want to do anything that would hurt him I don't want to do anything that would be against the word so the word is the son of prosperity can we say that the word is what is prosperous the word is the son of prosperity Isaiah 556 seek you the Lord while he may be found call you upon him while he's near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts let him return to listen to me church we times we forsake the ways but not the thoughts and the thoughts will lead you back to the wrong way wrong thoughts lead the wrong ways I don't know who that's for tonight but it just occurred to my mind and I think the Lord maybe wants us to know that wrong thoughts lead to wrong ways but forsake your thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God he will abundantly pardon yes sir for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways my thoughts than your thoughts oh for as the rain cometh down the snow from Heaven returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth in mood that it may give seed to the SE and bread to the eater so shall my word be that sh that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing were unto us oh do we believe that tonight church if he said there's going to be a Rapture that that Rapture that word is a prosperous word if he said oh church if he said we could have in that word is a word of prosperity if he said we could rejoice in the presence of God that word is a Hallelujah is a word of prosperity glory to God verse 12 for you shall go out with joy Hallelujah it'll Prosper why how you know it prospers you'll have joy in your life why the word said you can have joy and be led forth with peace you have peace the word says you can have peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into seeing all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the Thorns should come up the fur tree instead of the Briar shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall be not not be cut off his word finds a way all right like a river seeking its bed it finds a way Hallelujah see why does my life look so crooked sometimes it just the word finding a way why did I have to come up the way that I did the word found a way Hallelujah we don't always know what Prosperity is sometimes Prosperity looks like a prison sometimes it looks like a cross Jesus died on the cross the son of prosperity had had Nails put his hands a crown of thorns on his head he did that for me Church does that get old to you I hope not he did it for me he did it for you young people he did it for you hope they don't get old hope it can still touch your heart the son of prosperity was nailed to a cross for me Jesus died on the cross when he died he was raised to the right hand of his father father just like Joseph his Earthly estate I'll think about this for a minute he didn't look very prosperous his entire Earthly estate was one robe if they had done a an accounting as we used to have to do that in the title business an accounting of an estate and figure out what all somebody owned and see what piece of land went to who when you begin to look at his accounting of his estate he had one robe right oh church one robe that he had that was Earthly what did they do with it they took it and gambled on it and split it in two and and and now he was the son of prosperity dying and saying Lord my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me the Rich Young Ruler he might have been there I don't know we know we know sometime after he met Christ we don't know when but it's spoken of Jesus spoke of it so I guess maybe before Jesus died the Rich Young Ruler died we don't know the way that it speaks of it perhaps it was by Vision but he TP he he puts the stories brother brandom always puts the Rich Young Ruler with the one who was with the rich man that in Lazarus those were the same man right so the Rich Young Ruler was still a rich ruler but he became old he he become about retirement age he said Soul take thy rest got tired of building bigger barns put all his antique cars in he said Soul take thy rest and when he was done right aren't you glad you're saved by grace he chose the wrong thing he died in prosperity his estate they probably had a long list of things that he left to his children and everybody gathered around had a big funeral and said it was a wonderful thing and Jesus died like a sinner but after three days Jesus rose and and when he ascended he went to his father and was at his father's right hand and the the rich man found himself in Hell longing for a drink of water oh church he lifted up his eyes and hell I said let me choose the prosperity of the word not the prosperity of Life yeah not the prosperity of riches but the prosperity of the word now if you think about water and I'm going to close in just a moment I've got 12 minutes left and I'm done I'll just quit I know you don't believe me but I will but in a in a desert climate proximity to the water leads to Prosperity wars were fought over well right they they fought you find that in the Old Testament many times and we find one time there was a woman who came to a well looking for a more prosperous life looking for a little bit of prosperity a little bit of water to get her through her day yeah and Jesus told her said if you knew the gift of God and who it is that said to the give me the drink you would have ask of him and he would have given the Living Water he said if you knew other words like this brother B said if if you knew how close you was to the Fountain of Life I'd give you water that you wouldn't come here to draw I'll transplant you now Jesus had a need to go by Samar Samaria because he wanted to do some gardening now remember we were planted in his mind before the foundation of the world right in his thoughts where were we planted in the house of God serving God right but the devil in our flesh we were planted in a different place we're planted in the world under sin under judgment right but our real planting was in the word the inside man but the flesh was planted in the world are you with me now so Jesus brother brandom said Jesus went by her way to say this I'll transplant you yeah Hallelujah well what a great thought he come by your way Brother David and he said you were planted in my mind so I know you don't belong here he comes by Samaria and sees a woman who did not belong where she was she did not belong with all the husband she did not belong in getting water from that physical well he said I'll transplant you I'll bring you you sinner he said that's the unbeliever and doesn't believe in it if you'll only let me pluck you up this morning he said I'll plant you by the rivers of water I'll put you in a position by the baptism of the holy spirit that you'll believe every word that I say is the truth how many you're in that that position today have you been planted you were planted in his mind now be planted by the rivers of water where you can be an overcomer Hallelujah he said you just let me pluck you up this morning you'd be a good Branch you don't belong in that wild Vineyard glory to God you belong over here so let me pluck you up plant You in My Name by the side of the river every tributary of God's word for every word of God is do we believe that tonight every Divine promises the truth I'll plant you by the rivers of one water one God and you'll bring forth fruit in your season your leaves shall not wither whatsoever you do will prosper you'll stand when there's no other place to stand young people let him plant you tonight let him transplant you from the earth that you're in to a better place the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah he said let me pluck you up and plant you over here by this water he said that you don't have to run to these Creed places and denominational places to find you can't find it there anyhow let me pluck you up by this old dry well here that you have to take 10 buckets and Rattle and fuss and drink a little and come back and I do not comprehend why people want to go back to denomination I don't understand why they want to go back even to Pentecostal denomination but we're moving forward what are we doing we've been planted by rivers of water why would we go back to a sistern all right he said I'll give you eternal life he said Joy just like a wh bubbling up into everlasting life let me let me do that for you yes oh church as musicians come tonight let me do that for you Christ said to the woman The Sinner she had representation in his thoughts in a different place than she was planted in life so God said I'm going to move you from adultery sir Hallelujah I'm going to move move you from Dr drunkenness I'm going to move you are you with me church that's what he did for us he said I'm going to transplant you to where you were in my mind a son or daughter of God as though you never did it in the first place that's Prosperity the son of prosperity Hallelujah every plant he said that my father plants every Vine that my father plants Will Survive it'll bear good fruit Hallelujah Jesus stood up on the last day of the feast that last great day of the feast and he cried out I believe he's still standing and crying today if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water prosperous Waters said God let me be Pros prosperous I don't want to be prosperous in money or things but Lord let me be prosperous when Temptation comes let me overcome it may there be rivers of Living Water not not a little trickle of denominational water but rivers of the Holy Ghost that can anoint the word and overcome everything in my life oh that's what I want what about you Church you want to be prosperous
