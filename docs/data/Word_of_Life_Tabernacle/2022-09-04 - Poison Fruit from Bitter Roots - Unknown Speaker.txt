TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it does no good to blame the ones who did the wounding what if we were working say in construction and and are you still with me this morning let's imagine that we were on a job and and i was messing around and maybe i was trying to help and i'm not much of a construction worker but i remember one of the things that was a no-no on the job if there's a board with nails in it you don't leave it on the ground with the nails sticking up right so it's there's a board with nails in it but the caleb and maybe you and i are working out there on the job and that's that's a terrible thought isn't it you've worked with my brother you know what that's like but we'd be working out there and on the ground and and i'll leave a board out like that well i've been yelled at that before when i was a kid we helped out on construction sites and and they'd yell at me and say hey don't do that turn it around stick the nails in the ground or take it and throw it in the scrap heap don't leave it out there on the ground somebody will step on it right so i leave it on the ground you walk by you're not looking and you walk by but you don't you expect the sight to be clean you walk by and you get a nail in your foot now watch no no you've got a choice what you're going to do about that you can stand there and yell at me for leaving a board up yes it's my fault but you need to go to the doctor make sure you've had a tetanus shot and why do they do that i know some of us don't think that's necessary why do they give tetanus shots because if you get lockjaw if you get the the the disease that comes from that one out of 10 people with that disease die so you could literally die from stepping on a rusty nail and your family might gather around and at the funeral and they say oh brother ben was so terrible he left out a nail and but what really killed you think about it because there's a there's an antidote available you all you had to do was get a shot and then you can blame me all you want but you wouldn't die are you hearing me today there's an antidote available you need to deal with it because that rusty nail will spread that poison will spread and if you've been wounded in your spirit it does no good to stand there and yell at the person who did the wounding it does you absolutely no good you'll stand there and die your body will begin to die why because that bitterness spreads through your body and you say but i died of the nail no you didn't you died because of your refusal to deal with it the wound was not fatal but the poison that wasn't dealt with was fatal
