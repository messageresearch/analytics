[30:25] &gt;&gt; I just want to [singing] speak the name
[30:28] of Jesus
[30:32] over fear and all anxiety. [singing]
[30:39] To every soul held captive by [singing]
[30:43] depression,

[32:35] Shine through the shadows.
[32:39] Burn like [singing]
[32:40] a fire.
[33:29] I left a barren [singing] land.
[33:33] searching for rest.
[33:36] Stumbling round in amnesia,
[33:40] bitterness and distress. [singing]
[33:43] But then I met the kinsman redeemer
[33:47] who's called the mighty [singing]
[33:49] one. He took this whole Moabitete from
[33:53] the field and he brought me through his
[33:57] house [singing]
[33:59] and he said, "Fear not, my child for you
[34:05] are a part of [singing] me and I'll not
[34:08] rest till you are at my side. [singing]
[34:14] I will do all that you
[34:19] ask of me. Oh jewel in [singing] my
[34:23] eyes.
[34:25] Virtuous woman,
[34:28] you are [singing] my bride.
[34:36] I've responded to your call [singing]
[34:40] and you have covered me. [music]
[34:44] For with eyes of faith I [singing] see
[34:48] all the mysteries being revealed. And
[34:51] now I see who [singing] I am. And I
[34:55] [music] lay claim to all that's mine.
[34:58] I'm the [singing] lamb's wife.
[35:02] I've been bought with a price.
[35:06] [singing] And he said, "Fear not, my
[35:10] child, for you are a part of [singing]
[35:13] me, and I'll [music] not rest till you
[35:18] are at my side. [singing]
[35:22] I will do all that you
[35:26] ask of me. [singing]
[35:28] Virtue in my eyes.
[35:32] [music] Virtuous woman,
[35:35] you are my [singing] bride.
[35:41] [music]
[35:43] When I look back and see
[35:47] how much grace and [singing] love you've
[35:49] shown me, Lord, it brings me to my
[35:53] [singing] knees that you would even
[35:56] think about me. [music]
[35:59] You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're
[36:02] [singing] still the great.
[36:05] And with faith I'll stand [music] on
[36:07] your word because [singing] you're more
[36:10] than able.
[36:13] He said, "Fear not, my [singing]
[36:17] child for you are a part of me and
[36:21] [singing] I'll not rest till [music] you
[36:24] are at my side.
[36:28] I will do all that you [music]
[36:33] ask [singing] of me a ritual in my eyes.
[36:39] Virtuous [music]
[36:40] [singing] woman,
[36:42] you are my bride.
[36:47] And so I'm casting all my cares on you.
[36:51] [music]
[36:54] Oh, I know that you love me. [singing]
[36:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Redemption [singing]
[37:03] by blood.
[37:07] [music]
[37:08] That's the [singing] greatest love
[37:10] story.
[37:15] [music] Full [singing] restoration,
[37:19] full redemption.
[37:21] That's what seven [singing] angels in a
[37:24] clown
[37:26] testified
[37:28] my [singing] redeemer [music]
[37:30] no longer dead.
[37:32] He's alive
[37:35] and [music] he's coming [singing] back
[37:36] for me.
[37:41] And so I'm casting all my cares on you.
[37:47] Oh, I know that [music] you love me.
[37:55] [music] Redemption by blood.
[38:01] That's the greatest [singing] love
[38:03] [music] story.
[38:09] Full restoration,
[38:12] full redemption.
[38:15] That's what seven angels in [singing] a
[38:18] cloud
[38:19] testified.
[38:21] My redeemer's no longer dead.
[38:26] He's [singing] alive
[38:28] and he's coming [music] back for you and
[38:31] me.
[38:37] [applause]
[38:39] Amen. Aren't you thankful? Amen. We
[38:42] speak Jesus and our redeemer's alive.
[38:44] Brother Allan, we had a request for you
[38:46] to sing a a song. I think I sent it to
[38:49] you. Uh, didn't I walk on the water? I
[38:51] wonder as brother Allan sings this,
[38:53] we'll just go ahead and and let brother
[38:55] Allan sing this and then right after
[38:56] he's done, we'll invite the pastor.
[38:59] [music] Amen. Aren't you thankful for
[39:00] what we know this morning? Amen. We can
[39:03] speak Jesus, but aren't you thankful the
[39:04] full restoration, Amen, was by the we're
[39:07] the redeemed this morning. We have a
[39:09] reason to sing and shout and praise the
[39:11] Lord. Aren't you thankful for it?
[39:12] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give the Lord another hand clap of
[39:15] praise if you would.
[39:21] As I kneel in the [singing] darkness,
[39:25] in [music] the middle of the night,
[39:29] I'm praying for assurance [singing]
[39:33] everything's [music] going to be all
[39:35] right. Lord, I see another battle.
[39:38] [singing]
[39:40] It's out in front of me.
[39:43] I'm afraid I [singing and music] won't
[39:45] be able and I'll go down in defeat.
[39:52] He [music] said, [singing] "I walked on
[39:54] the water.
[39:56] I calmed the raging sea.
[40:00] I spoke to [music] the wind.
[40:03] It [singing] hushed and I gave you
[40:05] peace. Didn't I run to your rescue? And
[40:10] [music and singing] didn't I hear you
[40:12] when you called?
[40:14] I walked right beside you just so you
[40:19] wouldn't fall. [singing and music]
[40:21] Didn't I leave all of heaven
[40:25] to die for your sin?
[40:28] I searched [music]
[40:30] until I found you. And I do it all
[40:34] [singing] again.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:37] &gt;&gt; And now she's talking to her father in a
[40:41] house that was [music] once a [singing]
[40:43] home. Said, "My bills are coming due,
[40:47] Lord. 6 days is not that long."
[40:51] [singing and music] She hears a voice so
[40:53] still and low. Said, "I've moved like
[40:56] that before.
[40:58] I'll do [music] this little thing. Oh,
[41:02] and I'll [singing] give you so much
[41:04] more.
[41:06] He said, I walked on the water. I calmed
[41:12] [music and singing] the rag and sea. I
[41:15] spoke to the wind. It hushed and [music]
[41:19] I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your
[41:23] rescue [music and singing] and didn't I
[41:25] hear you when you called?
[41:28] I walked right beside [singing] you
[41:31] [music]
[41:32] just so you wouldn't fall. Did I leave
[41:37] all of [singing] heaven
[41:39] to die for your sin?
[41:42] I searched until I found you and I do it
[41:47] all again. [singing and music]
[41:50] And he said, "Do you remember
[41:54] just [music] where I [singing] brought
[41:56] you from?
[41:58] Just take a look behind you
[42:02] at how far you've [singing] come."
[42:05] And every time you ask [music] me,
[42:08] "Didn't I deliver [singing] you?"
[42:12] So why would you be [music] thinking
[42:15] I [singing] wouldn't see you through?
[42:18] Sing it with me.
[42:20] He [music] said, "I walked on [singing]
[42:22] the water. I calmed the raging sea. I
[42:28] spoke [music]
[42:29] to the wind.
[42:31] It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I
[42:35] run to your rescue and didn't I hear
[42:39] [music and singing] you when you called?
[42:41] I walked right beside you [music]
[42:45] just so you [singing] wouldn't fall. Did
[42:48] I leave all of [music] heaven
[42:52] to die for your sin?
[42:55] I searched [music] until I found you.
[42:58] Let's [singing] stand and sing it
[42:59] together once again.
[43:01] He said, "I walked on the water. [music]
[43:05] I calmed [singing] the raging sea. I
[43:09] spoke to the wind [music]
[43:12] in a hush and I gave the peace
[43:26] so you wouldn't fall. [music]
[43:29] Oh, did I leave all the heaven just
[43:33] [singing and music] to die for your sin?
[43:36] Well, I searched until I found you, and
[43:40] I do it all again. [singing]
[43:44] Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of
[43:45] praise this morning. [applause]
[43:47] [music] Aren't you thankful that he did
[43:49] it? I wonder if we can sing that chorus
[43:51] one more time as we invite our pastor.
[43:52] But I want you to think about what he's
[43:54] done for you. You know, if you think
[43:55] about what he's done for you, it'll make
[43:57] you worship different. If you think
[43:58] about what he's done for you, you'll be
[44:00] thankful. Lord, thank you for bringing
[44:02] me from where I came from. You know,
[44:04] we've got a right to be happy this
[44:05] morning in the house of God. Why?
[44:07] Because it ain't what we done, but it's
[44:08] what he did for us. Somebody say,
[44:10] "Praise the Lord." Let's sing it now.
[44:13] Oh, didn't I walk on the [singing]
[44:16] water?
[44:17] I called the raging sea. You know, he
[44:20] did it for you. I spoke to the [singing]
[44:23] wind. Don't you know, and hushed and I
[44:26] gave you peace. And didn't I run
[44:29] [singing] to [music] your rescue?
[44:33] Oh, yes you did.
[44:35] I walked right beside you
[44:39] so you wouldn't [singing] fall. [music]
[44:41] Oh, didn't I leave all of heaven just to
[44:46] die for your sin? [singing]
[44:49] I searched until I found you. And I do
[44:53] it all.
[45:04] Oh, I spoke to the wind. Oh, it hushed
[45:08] and [singing and music] I gave you
[45:10] peace. Didn't I run? Has he run to your
[45:13] rescue today? [music and singing] Didn't
[45:15] I hear you when you called? Oh, I walked
[45:19] [music and singing] right beside you
[45:22] so you wouldn't fall. Did [music] I
[45:25] leave all of heaven just to die for your
[45:30] sins?
[45:32] Oh, I searched until I found [singing]
[45:34] you. I do [music] it all again. Let's
[45:39] give him a hand of praise. Oh, don't you
[45:42] love him this morning?
[45:44] Amen. I'm glad he searched till he found
[45:47] you. Amen.
[45:50] Amen. Just a couple of things while
[45:51] you're standing and then we'll go right
[45:53] into the into the message this morning.
[45:56] Enjoy the song [music] service so far.
[45:58] We just really enjoyed the worship. Um
[46:00] we uh they still finishing up the
[46:03] counting, but it was very nearly
[46:04] unanimous on all the officers. I want to
[46:06] say how much I appreciate your unity on
[46:09] the church and we've added uh brother
[46:12] Bobby Rapert and uh brother uh Jeremy
[46:15] Erskin as trustees and I believe they'll
[46:17] serve honorably and with the other
[46:19] brothers that that are already serving
[46:21] and then reelected our current officers
[46:23] as well. I appreciate you again as a
[46:26] church. You just always it always amazes
[46:29] me. We only do this every couple of
[46:31] years. Uh but it always amazes me how
[46:34] much unity there is in the church and
[46:36] how much you love one another and I
[46:38] appreciate that and pray that that would
[46:40] always continue. Brother Bill Whiteamp
[46:43] has uh is retiring as a trustee. Of
[46:46] course, we'll leave the door open,
[46:48] brother Bill, if you ever want to come
[46:49] back and do that again. But get a second
[46:51] wind. But we appreciate Brother Bill,
[46:54] don't we? So much. And for 20 years, go
[46:56] ahead. That's all right.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[47:02] &gt;&gt; 20 years as a trustee here in the church
[47:04] and I I just really do appreciate
[47:07] brother Bill and his faithfulness in
[47:08] that. I got something for you, Brother
[47:10] Bill, but I'll have to wait. It didn't
[47:11] come in in time. It got delayed due to
[47:13] the holidays, but uh I got something for
[47:15] you, but we'll give that to you maybe
[47:17] next week. We sure love each and every
[47:19] one of you. Good to see you all, Sister
[47:21] Betty. It's so good to see you in church
[47:23] this morning. And I I just did my heart
[47:26] good when somebody texted me and told me
[47:27] you were you were here. That's it. It's
[47:29] just pray the Lord would continue to
[47:31] help you and to heal you and and uh
[47:33] Brother Robbie, good to see you as well.
[47:35] And each one that's here, the parties, I
[47:37] think they're here this morning. God
[47:39] bless you guys. Good to see you. It's
[47:41] been forever because when you all were
[47:42] here, I was gone. So we sure appreciate
[47:44] you. Keep praying for brother Bill and
[47:46] sister Karen. Brother Bill's still not
[47:48] able to be on his feet, but he wants to
[47:49] be real bad. We went to see him Friday
[47:51] and keep them in your prayers. Amen.
[47:54] Let's just bow our heads together and
[47:55] have a word of prayer as we go uh to the
[47:57] word. And maybe there's some need that
[48:00] you have in your life that you'd like to
[48:01] just lift to the Lord. I know he sees
[48:03] every hand, knows every heart.
[48:06] And uh we we just want to pray for these
[48:08] that have been elected. Pray the Lord
[48:09] would use them in their office and bless
[48:12] them. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we
[48:14] thank you for this little church here,
[48:16] Lord, in Hardy, Arkansas. Thank you for
[48:19] these people that love you with all of
[48:21] their heart. I pray God that you would
[48:23] just move in a mighty way among us.
[48:25] Lord, as the church always has to be set
[48:27] in order before a great move of the Holy
[48:29] Spirit. Lord, I pray that that move
[48:31] would be this morning. Revive us, oh
[48:33] God. Set us, Lord, on the path. Lord,
[48:36] that we would know that we're close to
[48:38] you in a world that's gone lukewarm. And
[48:41] Lord says they're rich and don't have a
[48:43] need of nothing. But Lord, we know, we
[48:45] recognize our need. Lord, many hands
[48:47] were raised this morning, people with
[48:49] needs. I pray that you'd meet those
[48:51] needs this morning. Pray you continue to
[48:53] bless Sister Betty and help her and her
[48:55] body and brother Bill and each one.
[48:57] Lord, I pray especially for the family
[49:00] of Sister Clelet this morning. Lord,
[49:01] that you'd bless them. Lord, as we lay
[49:03] her to rest tomorrow, may there be
[49:05] comfort in knowing where she is. I pray
[49:07] you'd grant it today, Lord. We thank you
[49:09] for these officers that have been
[49:10] elected. I pray that you'd help them.
[49:13] Give them a a spirit to serve you, Lord,
[49:15] and Lord, an energy to do what they need
[49:18] to do. I pray you'd bless them
[49:19] abundantly for their service and we'll
[49:21] thank you, give you the praise and the
[49:23] glory and the honor in Jesus name. Amen.
[49:27] Amen. God bless you. Turn with me to
[49:28] First Thessalonians chapter 2.
[49:31] 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 17.
[49:35] You ready for the word this morning?
[49:36] Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 17
[49:42] says, "But we, brethren, being taken
[49:44] from you for a short time in presence,
[49:46] not in heart, endeavored the more
[49:49] abundantly to see your face with great
[49:51] desire.
[49:53] Wherefore we would have come unto you,
[49:54] even I, Paul, once and again, but Satan
[49:57] hindered us." So he's saying, "We want
[49:59] to come and visit." He said, 'For what
[50:02] is our hope or joy or crown of
[50:05] rejoicing? Are not even ye in the
[50:09] presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
[50:12] coming? For ye are our glory and joy.
[50:17] Amen. Oh, if you're a glory and a joy
[50:20] and a crown to a to a minister or to a a
[50:23] messenger to the age, how much more to
[50:26] Christ?
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[50:29] God bless you. I want to speak on a
[50:30] crown of rejoicing. You may be seated
[50:32] this morning.
[50:37] Brother Brandham called the people that
[50:40] he preached to the stars in his crown.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; I I read you one of the quotes where he
[50:45] says that I believe last week. He also
[50:48] called it the jewel in the crown of his
[50:50] ministry. The jewel in the crown of his
[50:52] ministry. Malachi 3:17 speaks of that.
[50:56] It says, "They shall be mine, sayeth the
[50:58] Lord of hosts." in that day when I make
[51:00] up my jewels and I will spare them as a
[51:04] man spareth his own son that serveth
[51:07] him. So he said there's going to be a
[51:09] gathering of these jewels. You are God's
[51:12] jewels. You are a jewel in the crown of
[51:15] of the ministry. You are a crown of
[51:17] rejoicing for the ministry. I I don't
[51:20] understand preachers that want to beat
[51:22] the sheep. I I don't understand that at
[51:23] all because the people are the uh the
[51:27] effect of what you're preaching. They're
[51:29] the manifestation of what you're
[51:30] preaching. And I always take that
[51:32] personally. If the people aren't what
[51:34] they should be, then maybe I need to do
[51:36] better. Maybe I need to preach harder.
[51:38] And maybe I need to pray more. Maybe I
[51:40] need to do that. Because I believe this
[51:42] message produces jewels in the crown of
[51:45] his ministry. Don't don't ever let Satan
[51:47] get on you and begin to tell you you're
[51:48] not worthy or you're not good enough or
[51:50] you're not the typical message person or
[51:53] you're not this that or the other. Don't
[51:54] do that. You you're the jewels in his
[51:56] crown. The the message has made you what
[51:58] you are. You're you're the walking
[52:01] scripture today. You are what God wanted
[52:04] you to be and what he designed you to
[52:05] be. And you just believe that and serve
[52:07] God with all of your heart.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; We know that God's jewels are gathered
[52:12] by the preaching of the gospel. Yeah.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians chapter 1 18 it says,
[52:17] "For the preaching of the cross is to
[52:20] them that perish foolishness, but unto
[52:23] us which are saved." How many are saved
[52:26] this morning? Aren't you glad to be
[52:27] saved? He said, "Unto us which are
[52:29] saved, it is the power of God." Unto us
[52:34] which are saved, it is the power of God.
[52:36] For after that, verse 21, in the wisdom
[52:39] of God, the world by wisdom knew not
[52:41] God. It pleased God by what? by the
[52:44] foolishness of preaching. I know it
[52:46] seems foolish to people, but by the
[52:48] foolishness of preaching to save them
[52:50] that believe. It's God's method of
[52:52] gathering his jewels, of getting the
[52:54] word out, of spreading the word so that
[52:57] that light could cross the sea. Brother
[53:00] taught that preaching the gospel was
[53:01] more than spreading tracks. Did you know
[53:03] that? He said it's more than just giving
[53:05] and and if all you can do is give a
[53:07] track, that's good. But that's not
[53:09] preaching the gospel. Preaching the
[53:11] gospel is a demonstration of the power
[53:14] of the gospel. It's more than just
[53:16] getting up and saying words. It's more
[53:17] than just being able to read a quote,
[53:19] but it's actually a demonstrating of the
[53:22] power of God. We believe not only that
[53:23] we we DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT A Jesus that
[53:26] was or a Jesus that used to be able to
[53:28] heal OR OR A GOD THAT USED TO HAVE
[53:30] POWER. WE WE DEMONSTRATE that power
[53:33] today. WE BELIEVE THAT GOD IS STILL a
[53:35] healer. We believe he's still a savior.
[53:37] HE'S STILL THE ALMIGHTY GOD. HOW MANY
[53:39] BELIEVE THAT this morning? WE DIDN'T
[53:41] COME HERE WITH LOW EXPECTATIONS. WE
[53:43] DIDN'T COME HERE UH THINKING, WELL, WE
[53:45] we're going to serve a historical God
[53:46] today or we're just going to go through
[53:48] the motions AS A CHURCH. WE CAME HERE
[53:50] WITH A DESIRE IN OUR HEART TO SEE GOD
[53:52] MANIFESTED AMONG US. MORE THAN JUST
[53:55] ANOTHER SERVICE, MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER
[53:57] TIME THAT WE'VE GATHERED TOGETHER. BUT
[53:59] LET THIS BE A MOMENT WHEN DEMONS ARE
[54:02] BROKEN OFF OF PEOPLE'S LIVES AND CHAINS
[54:04] FALL OFF AND PEOPLE are renewed AND
[54:06] RESTORED AND THE WORD IS MADE CLEAR to
[54:09] people.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? MORE THAN JUST
[54:12] SPREADING a tract or giving out a book,
[54:14] though that's good, but it's
[54:16] demonstrating the power of the gospel.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; See, a convert to Christ is our crown of
[54:23] rejoicing.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Of rejoicing. IN FACT, THE Bible says
[54:27] that when a soul is saved, the angels
[54:30] rejoice
[54:31] &gt;&gt; rejoicing in heaven when a soul is
[54:34] saved. A and when we win someone to
[54:37] Christ, we know our name is eternally
[54:40] associated with that soul. So, what we
[54:43] do is so so important and a and how we
[54:47] ought to think about that. And I'm going
[54:48] somewhere with this. We're going to move
[54:50] this away from preachers here in a
[54:51] moment, but I think we need to we need
[54:54] to uh ruminate this morning on how uh
[54:57] how important the job is of speaking the
[55:00] gospel. Not because that makes us
[55:02] important. It makes us responsible,
[55:04] &gt;&gt; right? We're responsible for saying the
[55:07] right thing. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE
[55:09] DON'T MIX THE word with creed. We want
[55:11] to make sure we preach the message and
[55:13] say what he said and preach it in
[55:14] purity. We want to make sure that WE DO
[55:16] IT BECAUSE THAT'S GOD'S METHOD of
[55:18] gathering his jewels. We don't want to
[55:20] tarnish that in any way.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US THAT
[55:23] WHEN when we we win someone to Christ,
[55:26] our name is eternally associated with
[55:29] that soul.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[55:31] &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKED ABOUT GOING
[55:33] BACK TO AFRICA. And they told him, they
[55:35] said, "Why would you go back?" They
[55:36] said, "They might get you out there and
[55:38] run a spear through you or something."
[55:40] Brother Brandham, when he when he went
[55:41] the first time, he got deathly sick. He
[55:43] nearly died. And yet he wanted to go
[55:46] back. It was always in his heart to go
[55:47] back to go back to Africa. And today,
[55:50] Africa, there's probably more message
[55:52] believers in Africa than anywhere around
[55:54] the world. Millions of people that at
[55:56] least claim to believe the message of
[55:58] the hour in Africa. And and it was a
[56:00] place Brother Random really had a heart
[56:02] for. And he responded. He said, "Oh,
[56:04] they wouldn't do that." But he said, "If
[56:06] I could get one of those little children
[56:08] in my lap, put my arm around him and
[56:12] tell him in his native language, Jesus
[56:15] loves you, honey.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; He died for you."
[56:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's not much. It
[56:22] might win a soul."
[56:24] &gt;&gt; YOU REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU
[56:25] DO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CROSS OVER TO
[56:27] Africa to do that. You mas when your
[56:29] babies are little, when you gather them
[56:30] in your LAP AND YOU TELL THEM, YOU KNOW,
[56:32] "HONEY, Jesus loves you. Jesus loves
[56:35] you. YOU MAY HAVE HAD A BAD DAY, BUT
[56:37] JESUS LOVES YOU. YOU MIGHT BE HURT AND
[56:39] CRY, BUT JESUS LOVES YOU. WHEN YOU DO
[56:41] THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? YOU'RE
[56:42] CREATING SOMETHING IN THE LIFE OF THAT
[56:44] CHILD THAT THEY WANT TO LOVE HIM BACK.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; You're expressing the love of Jesus. And
[56:49] that's what he said, I want to do to
[56:51] these to these children. HE SAID IF THAT
[56:53] LITTLE BOY WOULD ACCEPT JESUS AS HIS
[56:55] SAVIOR, HE SAID OUT THERE YONDER IN
[56:57] ETERNITY WHEN THAT STAR SHINING OUT
[56:59] YONDER. HE SAID MY NAME WOULD BE
[57:02] ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CONVERT as long as
[57:04] there was a HEAVEN ABOVE. I TELL YOU
[57:05] what that was. It would be his crown OF
[57:07] REJOICING. OH, I TELL YOU, I WANT A
[57:09] CROWN of rejoicing ON THAT DAY. I DON'T
[57:11] WANT TO JUST BE A CHURCH MEMBER. I DON'T
[57:13] WANT TO JUST BE SOMEBODY WHO COMES AND
[57:15] GOES THROUGH THE MOTION, BUT LET ME BE A
[57:17] SOUL WINNER. LET ME BE SOMEBODY WHO WHO
[57:19] MANIFESTS THE WORD OF GOD TO MY
[57:22] GENERATION.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I thought of that. Brother
[57:28] Brandon was so tender in that and I
[57:30] didn't put the quote up there because
[57:32] just the way that he told it was so
[57:34] tender and I just thought Lord help me.
[57:36] I remember going and doing and all of
[57:40] that and and I and and and all the
[57:42] things that's happened over the years
[57:43] and I I excuse me for being personal for
[57:46] a moment, but it means a lot to you when
[57:49] somebody's saved
[57:51] &gt;&gt; and somebody comes in and yesterday I
[57:52] run across a run across a video and and
[57:57] it was brother Trip's baptism and I sent
[58:00] that to him and I I didn't do a very
[58:02] good job. I splashed water all over the
[58:04] place, you know, but he got him buried.
[58:06] And uh I got to looking at that and I I
[58:09] just rejoice in my spirit. I thought,
[58:12] well, that's what I'm that's my what I'm
[58:13] preaching on is a crown of rejoicing.
[58:16] There's there's a crown there of
[58:17] rejoicing that but it wasn't just me. It
[58:20] was his family. It was the people who
[58:22] manifested Christ to him as a young
[58:25] child and and the people who preached to
[58:27] him over the years. You don't
[58:28] understand. All of those THINGS ADD UP
[58:30] AND ONE day a decision is MADE FOR
[58:32] CHRIST AND THERE'S PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES
[58:34] will be ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SOUL FOR
[58:37] ETERNITY. THE WAY YOU TREAT PEOPLE
[58:39] MATTERS. THE WAY YOU LOVE PEOPLE
[58:40] MATTERS. YEAH. SHOWING UP AT CHURCH
[58:42] MATTERS. DOING ALL OF THESE THINGS, IT
[58:44] MATTERS.
[58:48] Brother Brandon said, "The only lasting
[58:50] value I'd rather have one soul in glory
[58:52] that I won to Christ to know and see
[58:54] THAT LIGHT OF GOD CIRCLES around that
[58:56] soul THROUGH ALL ETERNITY, MY NAME to be
[58:59] associated with that, then to have EVERY
[59:02] PENNY OF MONEY IN the whole earth
[59:03] because I'd have TO LOSE IT ALL. BUT
[59:05] WHAT YOU SEND UP THERE IS ETERNAL."
[59:07] RIGHT.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes we spend a lot of money
[59:11] and this year we've done gotten a lot
[59:13] done and we put a fence up for the kids
[59:15] and made a place for them out there and
[59:16] we're building a place for them to have
[59:18] activities and things. Hey, why do you
[59:20] do that? It's not about the activities.
[59:22] It's not about that. It's about winning
[59:24] a soul.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; It's about winning a soul. AND BROTHER
[59:28] SAID, "I'D RATHER HAVE MY NAME
[59:29] associated with that THAN EVERY PENNY. I
[59:31] WOULD THAT WE'D GO THROUGH EVERY PENNY
[59:33] THAT WE HAD IF IT MEANT THAT WE WERE
[59:34] TRYING TO REACH A SOUL SOMEWHERE.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; If these kids, maybe we just give them a
[59:39] place. YOU SAY, "WELL, WHY DO YOU TRY TO
[59:41] KEEP THEM in church?" Well, we try to
[59:42] keep them in an atmosphere they can be
[59:44] born again
[59:45] &gt;&gt; because we we believe in a in the
[59:47] atmosphere and and the results that it
[59:49] creates. So, we try to do things that
[59:51] would keep the CHILDREN AROUND BECAUSE
[59:53] ONE DAY THEY'LL HAVE A DECISION TO make
[59:55] and they'll be able TO GO OUT. BUT I
[59:56] JUST LOVE IT WHEN I SEE THEM MAKE A
[59:58] DECISION for Christ and say, "YOU KNOW
[59:59] WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT IN THE
[1:00:01] WORLD. I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY THE GAME.
[1:00:02] I'M going to stay in church. I'M GOING
[1:00:04] TO MY TESTIMONY IS GOING TO BE THAT
[1:00:06] GOD'S NOT ONLY ABLE TO SAVE A SINNER.
[1:00:08] BUT HE'S ABLE TO KEEP SOMEBODY. HE'S
[1:00:10] ABLE to keep them from those things.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; That's what we want for our children.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I had every penny of money
[1:00:19] in the whole earth, I'd have to lose it
[1:00:20] all. But what you send up there is
[1:00:21] eternal."
[1:00:24] Are you with me so far this morning?
[1:00:26] Matthew 6:19 says, "Lay not up for
[1:00:28] yourselves treasures upon earth, where
[1:00:31] moth and rust doth corrupt, where
[1:00:33] thieves break through and steal.
[1:00:36] Lay up for yourselves treasures in
[1:00:38] heaven.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Where neither moth nor rust doth
[1:00:41] corrupt, and where thieves do not break
[1:00:43] through nor steal. For where your
[1:00:46] treasure is, there were there will your
[1:00:49] heart be also." We're going to talk more
[1:00:51] about treasures in just a moment. But
[1:00:55] you might ask me, brother Ben, how does
[1:00:58] the average person Now, we're going to
[1:01:01] we're going to turn this to the entire
[1:01:03] body because we know that again, those
[1:01:05] who are saved under a ministry, that's a
[1:01:08] crown of rejoicing for that ministry.
[1:01:09] And I believe all of us are under the
[1:01:10] message of the hour. And and so we're a
[1:01:13] crown stars in the crown of the
[1:01:15] messenger of the hour in that way. But
[1:01:18] yet the the average person, you know, is
[1:01:22] not a preacher, right? Maybe in some
[1:01:24] churches, but most of us are not
[1:01:27] preachers. We've got two or three here
[1:01:30] today. Maybe all these young men are
[1:01:31] called. I don't know. And maybe that'll
[1:01:33] manifest in their lives, but most people
[1:01:35] are not. Most people don't have a call.
[1:01:39] But how does the average person, the the
[1:01:43] lay member if you will, the the person
[1:01:45] who is not called, may maybe not even an
[1:01:48] officer in the church, maybe maybe not
[1:01:50] even a singer, maybe somebody who just
[1:01:53] comes to church,
[1:01:56] as if that's a small thing, right, in
[1:01:59] this day and age, but somebody who just
[1:02:00] comes and lives the life and does the
[1:02:02] best that they can do and lives a simple
[1:02:05] life and tries to serve the Lord and
[1:02:07] maybe they work and and maybe even
[1:02:09] somebody that can't come all the time or
[1:02:11] is unable to and maybe they're
[1:02:13] frustrated with themselves. Maybe you're
[1:02:14] frustrated with yourself this morning
[1:02:16] and wish I did a better job.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Am I speaking to anybody this morning?
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; And that average person is struggling
[1:02:24] and say, "Well, if I could just be like
[1:02:25] the preacher, if I could just reach and
[1:02:28] and help people and go overseas and
[1:02:30] travel around and and preach and be an
[1:02:32] evangelist or be a preacher, man, my
[1:02:35] life would be better."
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Of course, you don't know the the
[1:02:38] other side of that. You don't know the
[1:02:39] frustrations of that and and the
[1:02:42] pressure that comes with that.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; And yet, it's an honor to serve. But but
[1:02:46] how do you win a crown
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; of rejoicing? See, I believe you can.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; In fact, I believe many of you will.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; But how do you do that? So, you're not
[1:02:58] called to the ministry of Ephesians
[1:03:00] 4:11, but you're called to do something
[1:03:03] in the body of Christ. Right?
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; See, the first way that you obtain a
[1:03:08] crown of rejoicing is just by being a
[1:03:10] part of a local church. So, you being a
[1:03:14] part of a local church body identifies
[1:03:17] you with everything that that church is,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; right? And so, you might be the the
[1:03:23] least active member of that church. You
[1:03:26] might be elderly. You might be UNABLE TO
[1:03:28] DO WHAT all you used to do. I know
[1:03:30] Sister Fritz has expressed to me. I know
[1:03:32] I talk about Sister Fritz all the time,
[1:03:33] but she's expressed to me before that
[1:03:36] how feeble she felt and unable to do
[1:03:39] things. She she had always done things
[1:03:40] in the church. And I know many of you
[1:03:42] feel that way. You feel like, well, I
[1:03:44] just can't do what I feel like I should
[1:03:46] do. And and it frustrates you. But just
[1:03:48] being a part makes a difference,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Because everything done by the body and
[1:03:52] in the body is done by you. That's
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So every soul
[1:03:58] that's one by the church is one by the
[1:04:00] individual in the church because we are
[1:04:03] not separate. We're one body.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; So in the first place you say, well if
[1:04:08] that's true, how do I become a member of
[1:04:09] the church? Now we don't have a
[1:04:11] membership. Right? We don't have a place
[1:04:13] where you sign your name because that
[1:04:15] don't mean much.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Right? You could sign your name to the
[1:04:19] membership role and never show up. You
[1:04:21] could sign your name to the membership
[1:04:22] role and never even be a Christian. So
[1:04:25] that's not what it is. The first place
[1:04:26] you got to be born again. That places
[1:04:29] you in the body.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; But we're not a judge of who is born
[1:04:32] again and who is not. We want everybody
[1:04:34] to come to the house of God.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Right. But the first thing is just you
[1:04:38] and yourself. You've got to know that
[1:04:40] you're born again. And I believe that
[1:04:42] many, if not most of us sitting here
[1:04:44] today are. And if you're not, here's a
[1:04:46] place where you can be.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to give an opportunity. I
[1:04:50] think as a message people, we've gotten
[1:04:51] away from that too much. We need
[1:04:53] opportunities in every service for
[1:04:55] somebody to come to Christ or to return
[1:04:57] to Christ or or OR TO BREAK OFF THE
[1:04:59] coldness and things like that. We need
[1:05:01] to create those opportunities.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; But but how do you become a part of the
[1:05:08] local church? Well, brother Brandham
[1:05:08] taught us it was your tithe, offering,
[1:05:10] and attendance.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; So that's why that's how you what how
[1:05:16] you tell who is a voter and who's not.
[1:05:18] Again, we don't keep a role. We don't
[1:05:20] put anybody out. But but that's how you
[1:05:23] know it's tithes, offering, and
[1:05:24] attendance. Brother Brandham defines a
[1:05:26] person who comes here regular and
[1:05:28] supports it with your tithe and
[1:05:29] offerings as a member of the church.
[1:05:31] It's an active participation in the
[1:05:33] local church. We say, "Brother Ben, what
[1:05:35] does that have to do with a crown of
[1:05:38] rejoicing?"
[1:05:40] Again, whatever the body does, so think
[1:05:42] of the local church as a body. We're not
[1:05:44] separate. We're one.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; All of us
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; are one.
[1:05:52] You said, "Well, brother so and so, he's
[1:05:53] more feeble." We're one,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; sister so and so, they don't they're not
[1:05:57] able to come as much as as somebody
[1:05:59] else. We're one,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; right? Even if a person would be
[1:06:03] backslid. It's just a part of the body.
[1:06:05] Look, when a part of your body
[1:06:07] backslides, you try everything you can
[1:06:08] to get it working again before you cut
[1:06:10] it off.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:15] If your leg backslid on you, you don't
[1:06:16] just cut it off. So, just get rid of it.
[1:06:18] It's not working no more. You try to fix
[1:06:20] it.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; You put it in a splint. You give it
[1:06:23] extra care. And Paul teaches that. He
[1:06:24] said we give extra care to those parts
[1:06:26] of the body that need care.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Right. So, so we don't just cut it off.
[1:06:31] We don't do away with it. So, the part
[1:06:32] the body is a unit. It's one one unit.
[1:06:36] And so, whatever the church does, good
[1:06:38] or bad, is part of what and who you are.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Right. So, we're not separate from the
[1:06:44] body. And that's why we we should be
[1:06:45] accountable to the body. And we should
[1:06:47] also hold the body accountable.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Right. We do that by our vote, by our
[1:06:52] participation, by uh by our prayer and
[1:06:55] try to do that. Now, in 1 Corinthians
[1:06:57] 12:25, Paul teaches us that we're not
[1:07:00] separate from the body. He said that
[1:07:01] there should be no schism in the body.
[1:07:03] Other words, no separation, but that the
[1:07:05] members should have the same care one
[1:07:08] for another.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Not just for our family members.
[1:07:12] Come on, church. There's a certain care
[1:07:14] you have for your family. You're
[1:07:15] responsible for things. You're not
[1:07:16] responsible for other families too. I
[1:07:18] understand that. But we should have the
[1:07:20] same care,
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; right, for one another. Verse 26. And
[1:07:24] whether one member suffer, all someone
[1:07:28] say it with me, all the members suffer
[1:07:31] with it.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; When one member is unable to come to the
[1:07:35] house of God, we all suffer that loss.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; When one or he said, he turns it around
[1:07:42] or one member be honored. How many?
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; All the members rejoice with it.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; So when a brother gets a promotion,
[1:07:51] whether it's in the church or whether
[1:07:52] it's somewhere else, whether it's on the
[1:07:54] job or something, uh maybe a brother, we
[1:07:56] don't envy. WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT and
[1:07:58] say, "Well, that brother got it and I
[1:07:59] didn't or that brother got promoted.
[1:08:01] That brother got this or that and I
[1:08:02] didn't." No. We're a part of the body of
[1:08:04] Christ. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? SAY,
[1:08:06] "LORD, I'm so thankful that my brother's
[1:08:08] doing good. I MAY NOT HAVE A PENNY TO MY
[1:08:10] NAME, BUT I'M SO THANKFUL, MY BROTHER,
[1:08:12] THAT YOU BLESSED my brother." That's the
[1:08:14] kind of attitude that we ought to have.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; See, if one member is honored, all the
[1:08:18] members rejoice with it.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And and that's the way the body works.
[1:08:22] See, brother Brandon said there were
[1:08:24] gifts in the body. And we don't have
[1:08:25] time to get into gifts this morning, but
[1:08:27] he talked about gifts of healing and how
[1:08:29] he talked about a man by the name of
[1:08:30] Brother Christ at the tabernacle that
[1:08:32] had been uh had had gotten in an
[1:08:34] accident. And he said there was a
[1:08:36] brother from the church. He said, "Not a
[1:08:38] preacher or anybody else." He said,
[1:08:39] "Just a brother." He said he had on his
[1:08:42] heart to go pray for brother Grace. He
[1:08:45] said he showed up at the hospital room.
[1:08:46] He said, "I'm not brother Brandham." He
[1:08:48] said, "I'm not one of the trustees of
[1:08:49] the deacons, but I just had on MY HEART
[1:08:51] TO GO pray for." We've seen that work
[1:08:53] before, haven't we, brother Brandon,
[1:08:54] sister Charity. You've seen God put it
[1:08:56] on a heart of somebody. Go pray for
[1:08:57] somebody. Makes a difference, church.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Obey the leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; But he put it on the heart of this
[1:09:04] brother to go pray for brother Grace.
[1:09:05] And and the brother Winnie said, "I'm
[1:09:07] not worthy to pray for you." He said,
[1:09:09] "Brother Grace was a preacher." HE SAID,
[1:09:11] "I'M NOT WORTHY TO PRAY FOR YOU." HE
[1:09:13] SAID, "BUT I JUST FELT TO DO IT." HE
[1:09:15] SAID, "WHEN HE PRAYED FOR HIM, he was
[1:09:16] healed."
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "It was a gift OF HEALING IN
[1:09:19] THE BODY."
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; GIFTS OF HEALING ARE NOT JUST HERE ON
[1:09:23] THE PLATFORM. GIFTS OF HEALING ARE IN
[1:09:25] THE BODY.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. They shall lay hands on the
[1:09:29] sick. WHO IS HE TALKING ABOUT? THE
[1:09:31] BELIEVERS.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; The believers. Are you a believer today?
[1:09:34] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:09:36] they shall recover.
[1:09:38] Hallelujah. A gift of healing in the
[1:09:40] body of Christ. AND LAY MEMBERS ARE JUST
[1:09:42] AS MUCH A PART of the body as anyone
[1:09:45] else.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; In Christ, you understand that we have a
[1:09:53] because we believe in a biblical uh
[1:09:55] method of of leadership. So, we put men
[1:09:58] in leadership unlike many churches.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; We believe that's biblical.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; But the but the ladies have just as much
[1:10:05] a part of the body as the men do.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Right?
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Because he Paul tells us very clearly in
[1:10:10] Christ we're all the same.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; You can pray for somebody.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; You you can help somebody. A woman is
[1:10:18] not to take authority domination over a
[1:10:21] man. But a woman does have a right to
[1:10:24] talk to her children
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; to pray for them to teach the younger
[1:10:27] women. Are you with me now?
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; A woman, some of you elders have a great
[1:10:31] role in that in the way that you act and
[1:10:33] the way that you DRESS TO HELP SOMEBODY
[1:10:35] ELSE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO
[1:10:36] UNDERSTAND. NOT EVERYBODY, but the way
[1:10:38] that YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF IS A LESSON to
[1:10:40] the next generation.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for that. Your
[1:10:45] faithfulness, SOME OF YOU ELDERS, YOUR
[1:10:46] FAITHFULNESS is a lesson to the next
[1:10:48] generation. Is teaching them something.
[1:10:51] And so, what do we do? We we want the
[1:10:53] whole body to be we want the whole body
[1:10:57] to be helped. And so, we participate in
[1:10:59] the local body. How do we participate?
[1:11:01] By tithing. I have never preached on
[1:11:04] tithing here at the church because I've
[1:11:06] never had to. Y'all are maybe the best
[1:11:08] tithe payers on the planet. I think we
[1:11:11] sure appreciate it. I we've never had
[1:11:13] I've never had to ask for money for
[1:11:15] anything. And all look at all that we've
[1:11:18] done here in the church in the last uh
[1:11:20] five or six years. Even in the last 20
[1:11:22] years or 25 years since the church was
[1:11:24] built, you guys have maintained it. Even
[1:11:26] when the church was small, you guys kept
[1:11:28] up your support and I I appreciate that
[1:11:30] so much. I'm thankful for that. It
[1:11:34] matters. Why? You you you care about the
[1:11:36] church, not because it's of the
[1:11:38] building. Listen, we're not attached to
[1:11:39] this building. What do we We want to win
[1:11:42] a soul to Christ. We want to have a
[1:11:43] crown of rejoicing.
[1:11:45] So, there's a the tithing is makes you a
[1:11:48] part of that. What are what are tithes?
[1:11:49] I want to talk about it for just a
[1:11:50] minute and then we'll let it go. But and
[1:11:52] again, not because we have an issue with
[1:11:54] it because we you guys do wonderfully
[1:11:56] and I appreciate that, but our younger
[1:11:57] ones need to hear it. They need to
[1:11:59] understand what it is. And tithes are
[1:12:01] 10% of your increase, right? That that's
[1:12:04] what tithing is. The word tithe means
[1:12:06] tenth. Deuteronomy 14:22, thou shalt
[1:12:09] truly tithe all the increase of thy
[1:12:10] seed. That the field bringeth forth year
[1:12:12] by year. If you were a businessman, that
[1:12:14] would be profit. Tithe would be 10% of
[1:12:16] the profit. If you were a wage earner,
[1:12:19] it' be 10% of your take-home pay, if you
[1:12:22] could say it like that. 10%. You say,
[1:12:23] "Well, that's a lot." Well, it's less
[1:12:25] than Uncle Sam takes. You know,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; wish they'd stick with 10%.
[1:12:31] I
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; said, "Well, who should pay tithe?"
[1:12:33] Well, whoever has an increase,
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; right? I didn't bring it out with me,
[1:12:37] but I got a little tithe envelope in my
[1:12:39] office that Finley gave me, and I kept
[1:12:42] it. I don't think I ever opened it.
[1:12:43] There may be $1,000 in there. I'm not
[1:12:45] sure, but uh I kept that Finley. And I I
[1:12:49] have that uh on my desk because he wrote
[1:12:52] it and he it had income and and he said
[1:12:55] it said daily or or weekly or monthly.
[1:12:57] And he said, "I'm not sure.
[1:13:01] It just depends on
[1:13:03] depends on how much dad gives him. I
[1:13:05] guess up that boy's allowance, he's
[1:13:07] paying tithe. I mean,
[1:13:10] but you know, it it matters. You teach
[1:13:11] your little ones to do that and be
[1:13:13] faithful in that. It matters.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Even my children, they're my children.
[1:13:16] And we as as a pastor, that's what we
[1:13:19] live off of is tithing. And yet they pay
[1:13:22] tithes into the church. And I'm so
[1:13:24] thankful for that. We try to teach them
[1:13:26] to do that. And I watch some of you
[1:13:27] young men and and grow up in the church
[1:13:29] and sometimes I kind of wonder and be
[1:13:31] like, I wonder what you know where
[1:13:33] they're at spiritually and things and I
[1:13:34] watch your tithe checks come in and
[1:13:36] young men that wouldn't that you know
[1:13:38] and there's no requirement. We don't
[1:13:39] make people pay tithe. I'll pray for you
[1:13:42] just as much if you don't as if you do.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I don't even pay attention to it.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; We do things for taxes at the end of the
[1:13:49] year, but other than that, we don't pay
[1:13:50] attention to it. And I I don't I don't
[1:13:52] let that affect my view of the people. I
[1:13:54] really don't. I tried my best not to do
[1:13:57] that. And and but we've got we we got
[1:14:00] young men that they wouldn't have to.
[1:14:01] Maybe they could let it slide or
[1:14:02] something. They don't have a lot of
[1:14:03] money, but they pay their tithing. I've
[1:14:04] watched that. I'm thankful for that. It
[1:14:07] it matter it means you're taking the
[1:14:08] things of God seriously.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Right. So ministers also pay tithe.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Nehemiah chapter 10
[1:14:17] verse 38, the priest, the son of Aaron
[1:14:18] shall be with the Levites when the
[1:14:20] Levites take tithe and the Levites shall
[1:14:21] bring up the tithe of the tithes. So,
[1:14:24] it's not just the people that pay tithe,
[1:14:25] but the Levites pay a tithe on the tithe
[1:14:28] to the house of our God, to the
[1:14:30] chambers, and to the treasure house.
[1:14:31] Paul mentions this in the New Testament.
[1:14:33] Hebrews 7:9, he said, "As I may so so
[1:14:36] say, Levi also who receiveth tithe paid
[1:14:40] tithe in Abraham." That's a wonderful
[1:14:43] Listen, church, when you you say, "Well,
[1:14:45] I've been faithful in my tithes, but I
[1:14:46] don't understand how that would be a
[1:14:48] blessing." God credited it to Levi's
[1:14:51] greatgrandchildren.
[1:14:53] Hallelujah. It matters, church. 1
[1:14:57] Corinthians uh 9:13 tells us where
[1:15:00] tithes go. He said, "Do you not know
[1:15:02] that they which minister about holy
[1:15:03] things live of the things of the
[1:15:05] temple?" He said, "They which wait at
[1:15:07] the altar are partakers with the altar."
[1:15:08] So, in other words, those who minister
[1:15:10] have a right to the the tithing that
[1:15:13] comes in. He said, "Even so hath the
[1:15:15] Lord ordained that they which preach the
[1:15:16] gospel should live the gospel." Brother
[1:15:18] Brandon tells us over and over again, he
[1:15:20] said that if people would pay their
[1:15:21] tithes, we wouldn't have to have soup
[1:15:23] suppers to pay the preachers. Do you
[1:15:25] realize how much pre how much less
[1:15:26] pressure is on us because of the
[1:15:28] principle of tithing? I don't have to
[1:15:30] raise money. You realize most
[1:15:32] denominational pastors, their main job
[1:15:34] is to raise money.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's job number one. Before preaching,
[1:15:37] before counseling, before anything else,
[1:15:39] raise money. We don't have to do that.
[1:15:41] Why? We have a message.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; We've been taught. We've been taken back
[1:15:44] to the scripture.
[1:15:46] Are you with me now?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; So then the minister is responsible for
[1:15:51] what he does with that money. When I
[1:15:53] paid ti all my life and when I pay my
[1:15:55] tithe, I'm giving that to the Lord. Not
[1:15:57] to a particular man. I'm giving that to
[1:15:59] the Lord. But I'm paying that where I
[1:16:01] get fed at my local church. I give it to
[1:16:03] them and it's up to them to be
[1:16:04] responsible to God. But I've done my
[1:16:06] part.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham's asked a question
[1:16:09] about that. Should a person pay ties to
[1:16:11] an individual or should a Christian
[1:16:12] work? That's kind of a loaded question.
[1:16:14] He said, "Of course." He said, he said,
[1:16:16] "A Christian will work." He said, "He's
[1:16:17] the one man that will work
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; is a Christian." [clears throat]
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And uh he said, "Pay tithe to an
[1:16:23] individual." Depends on who the
[1:16:24] individual is. He uses the example of
[1:16:26] Melzdc. And then we'll pick it up here.
[1:16:28] He said, "Really, where you owe tiths is
[1:16:30] where you get your food. Bring you all
[1:16:31] your tiths into my storehouse, sayeth
[1:16:33] the Lord, and prove me wherein, sayith
[1:16:34] God, if I'll not open the windows of
[1:16:36] heaven and pour out a blessing that you
[1:16:38] would not have room in it to receive
[1:16:39] it." He said, 'I challenge any man or
[1:16:41] woman that's not a tithe payer to accept
[1:16:44] that. Y'all better pay attention. This
[1:16:46] may be the only time I ever preach on
[1:16:48] tithe, but we'll get off of it in a
[1:16:50] minute. But the Brandon talked about
[1:16:52] himself how he paid tithe. He said, "I'd
[1:16:53] give a tenth, then I'd give it out to
[1:16:54] ministers, give the rest of it to
[1:16:56] ministers." He said, "Then when I
[1:16:57] couldn't do that," he said, "Then the
[1:16:59] thing I did, I kept 10% and give God
[1:17:00] 90." He said, "Then when the law told me
[1:17:02] I couldn't do that," he said, "if I did
[1:17:04] was all to be charged to it." He said, '
[1:17:06] Then I had to take and bypass it into
[1:17:07] foreign missions and so forth. Take a
[1:17:09] wage out of that of $100 a week and I
[1:17:11] pay my tithe from that. And that's the
[1:17:13] way our church is set up on that model
[1:17:15] that the tithes go into one account, the
[1:17:17] offerings go into another. And I take of
[1:17:19] that tithing, I take enough to live on
[1:17:21] and the rest goes to ministry. It goes
[1:17:23] to bring in preachers. It goes at times
[1:17:26] we've helped remodel the church. That's
[1:17:27] an offering that we give from the
[1:17:28] tithing account. We've been able to do
[1:17:30] that. And I'm so thankful that you guys
[1:17:32] are faithful because it lets us do what
[1:17:34] we do. Thank you for that.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; So, well, we get that from brother
[1:17:39] Brandham and from the scripture. He took
[1:17:40] it from the scripture. He said, "Yes,
[1:17:42] sir. I believe in paying ti. It's one of
[1:17:44] God's blessings. It's proven to be a
[1:17:45] blessing." You say, "That's of the Old
[1:17:47] Testament. It's of the New Testament,
[1:17:48] too." I've seen that doctrine get
[1:17:50] started recently around the message that
[1:17:52] that's an Old Testament doctrine, but
[1:17:53] the Brandom said it wasn't.
[1:17:56] Malachi 3:10 says, "Bring you all the
[1:17:58] tithes into the storehouse that there
[1:18:00] may be meat in my house and prove me now
[1:18:02] herewith, sayeth the Lord of hosts. If I
[1:18:04] will not open you the windows of heaven,
[1:18:05] pour you out a blessing, there should
[1:18:07] not be room enough to receive it."
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Tithing is a blessing. But I want to say
[1:18:12] this to our young people. Tithe paying
[1:18:13] is a habit. And not paying tithe is a
[1:18:16] habit.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; The easiest way is just put back your
[1:18:20] tithe and give that to God first
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; and the next time you're at church. that
[1:18:24] that's just the easiest way to do it.
[1:18:26] It's it's easy to spend money if you you
[1:18:28] know if you got it. And it's much
[1:18:31] easier. I'll say this, some people don't
[1:18:32] pay tithe because they don't know where
[1:18:33] their money's going. And and maybe it's
[1:18:36] indication of a of a bigger problem even
[1:18:39] in their own life that I think we have a
[1:18:41] responsibility to God to manage our
[1:18:43] money correctly.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; All of us do.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; We're not saved by tithing.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Person could tithe and be a devil.
[1:18:53] That's right.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; We're not saved by tithing, but a person
[1:18:55] who's faithful in the little things
[1:18:57] receives promotion from the Lord. We're
[1:18:58] taught that from the scripture. So,
[1:19:00] Brother Brandon gets this. He said, "I'd
[1:19:02] like to give you a personal testimony
[1:19:03] how I was even hungry and my mother and
[1:19:05] them hungry and my daddy's sick, but I
[1:19:07] took my ties out first and give it to
[1:19:09] God. You ought to see what happened.
[1:19:11] I've never seen in my life, what a
[1:19:13] testimony this is. I've never seen in my
[1:19:15] life that any man or woman that if you
[1:19:17] only make $1 a week will bring the 10
[1:19:19] cents of that money, put it in your
[1:19:20] storehouse or a church where you come.
[1:19:22] If God don't bless that, call me a
[1:19:23] hypocrite.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; I've watched some of you, I know some of
[1:19:26] you don't have very much. And I know at
[1:19:28] the end of the week, it's tough. And
[1:19:29] I've watched some of you faithfully pay
[1:19:30] tithe. And I pray, Lord, bless them
[1:19:33] abundantly.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Abundantly. Because for some, it's just
[1:19:37] 10% is not that much cuz but some need
[1:19:40] that 10% to live on. They really need
[1:19:42] it.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; But they give it to God anyway. And I
[1:19:44] believe there's a blessing for that.
[1:19:46] Like that woman that come and gave her
[1:19:47] two pen seeds, but Jesus said she gave
[1:19:49] all that she had. Others gave her their
[1:19:51] abundance. There's nothing wrong with
[1:19:53] that. But she gave all that she had.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, an offering is different from
[1:19:58] tithe. So, we're done with tithe.
[1:20:00] Everybody exhale.
[1:20:05] An offering is different from tithe.
[1:20:07] Offerings go to the church to pay the
[1:20:08] bills. Don't go it don't go to the
[1:20:10] ministry. Right? So, what you pay if you
[1:20:12] just put a dollar in the offering plate,
[1:20:13] that don't come to me. That don't come
[1:20:15] to any of the ministry. That comes to
[1:20:18] that goes to the church.
[1:20:20] So the church, [snorts] we have never
[1:20:23] had to beg for money and offerings.
[1:20:25] Again, I'm thankful for that because I
[1:20:27] know preachers personally in the message
[1:20:29] who have to give thousands of dollars a
[1:20:30] month to the church just to keep the
[1:20:32] lights on. We've never had to do that
[1:20:34] because y'all are faithful. There's a
[1:20:36] crown of rejoicing in that,
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; right? That's how you win souls is be
[1:20:41] faithful to the little things.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Brother Brand saw a
[1:20:45] construction project. I won't spend much
[1:20:47] time on this, but brother Brandina
[1:20:49] construction project. They were building
[1:20:50] a new church across the road. He said,
[1:20:52] "That shows you're backing up the right
[1:20:53] thing." And God's servant is trying his
[1:20:56] best to give the best he can to God's
[1:20:57] people. Every congregation will
[1:20:59] appreciate a pastor like that. That you
[1:21:01] see what your finances, your tithes,
[1:21:02] your offerings, and so forth. He's going
[1:21:04] straight into the kingdom of God to
[1:21:06] embed the kingdom of God. Make a better
[1:21:08] place, not for himself. I don't believe
[1:21:10] a preacher, a pastor ought to live above
[1:21:12] the people. I don't believe I ought to
[1:21:14] be a multi-millionaire and a bunch of
[1:21:16] people struggling. I don't believe it's
[1:21:17] right.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? That's just me
[1:21:20] personally. But I do believe that we're
[1:21:22] going to put everything we can back into
[1:21:24] the into the house of God.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Not for himself, for you."
[1:21:28] He's got the sheep on his mind. The
[1:21:30] shepherd always has.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. WHETHER I'M HERE
[1:21:33] OR NOT, AND I'M HERE most of the time,
[1:21:35] but if I'm not here, you're still on my
[1:21:36] mind.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Every moment, every morning, I wake up
[1:21:40] and I'm thinking about somebody. What
[1:21:41] What about brother so and so? And maybe
[1:21:42] I don't always reach out or something
[1:21:44] and I'm reluctant to do that sometimes
[1:21:46] because people don't want you to meddle.
[1:21:47] But I'm praying for you. I want you to
[1:21:49] understand that church. We're praying
[1:21:51] for you. And we have ministry here in
[1:21:53] the church that cares for you and it's
[1:21:54] praying for you. I got deacons here in
[1:21:56] the church that cares for you and
[1:21:58] praying for you.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think nobody sees you,
[1:22:02] nobody knows what's going on. I know
[1:22:04] sometimes people slip out of church.
[1:22:05] I've had people GO OUT, THEY QUIT
[1:22:07] ANSWERING THEIR PHONE. They they they
[1:22:08] won't let you contact them and there's
[1:22:10] no way to let them know. BUT IF THEY
[1:22:11] ONLY knew how much people cared for
[1:22:13] them,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; maybe they wouldn't slip out like that
[1:22:16] and and just leave and maybe thinking
[1:22:18] maybe the devil put it in their mind,
[1:22:19] nobody cares. But I believe not only the
[1:22:21] ministry cares, but God put that care in
[1:22:23] them. And I believe God cares this
[1:22:25] morning. HE CARES ABOUT EVERYTHING GOING
[1:22:27] on in your life. HE CARES ABOUT EVERY
[1:22:29] LITTLE MOMENT of your life.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; So a an offering is a free will thing.
[1:22:35] Just however much. If you have a dollar
[1:22:37] a week, that's that's an offering,
[1:22:39] right? whatever you have just an
[1:22:41] offering that's on top that that would
[1:22:43] be extra something extra that you just
[1:22:45] have and so the 2 Corinthians 9:7 every
[1:22:48] man according as he purposes in his
[1:22:49] heart again even tithing we don't make
[1:22:51] you do that right we want you to obey
[1:22:53] God so as you purpose in your heart let
[1:22:56] him give
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; not grudgingly or of necessity for God
[1:23:01] loves a cheerful giver
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; do you believe that
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; so attendance
[1:23:07] now let's talk about that for a minute
[1:23:08] it's simply obeying command of
[1:23:10] scripture. And I I know people get all
[1:23:13] tied up in the world that we live in. We
[1:23:14] live in an area where jobs are
[1:23:16] difficult. I understand that. I I I know
[1:23:19] it's hard sometimes to always be in the
[1:23:21] house of God. And and I know people will
[1:23:23] tell me, "So, does streaming count?"
[1:23:26] Well, I believe God sees your heart.
[1:23:27] That's
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Right. If you could go to church and you
[1:23:30] don't, that's one thing. But if you
[1:23:32] can't go to church, and I I' I'd love
[1:23:34] for you to stream because I believe the
[1:23:36] word will do you good.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; I believe the atmosphere will do you
[1:23:38] good. And I believe that comes through
[1:23:39] in some level. It's not the same as
[1:23:41] being at church, but believe it comes
[1:23:43] through at some level. And so I thank
[1:23:45] you. I know most of you are faithful if
[1:23:47] you're not here to stream. And we're
[1:23:48] spread out all over the country, right?
[1:23:51] And I understand that we got people
[1:23:52] driving three hours, two hours, an hour
[1:23:54] and a half, and I'm thankful for you. It
[1:23:56] it humbles me that you find time to come
[1:23:58] to the house of God. But what are you
[1:24:00] doing? You're just obeying the command
[1:24:01] of the scripture. You're becoming a part
[1:24:03] of the church.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Right. So if you never come, if you
[1:24:07] don't ever come, it's hard. It's
[1:24:09] difficult. And we have people who stream
[1:24:11] who've been unable to be here for
[1:24:12] months. I do believe their heart is to
[1:24:15] be in the house of God.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; God sees that. He knows your heart. But
[1:24:20] the Bible tells us in Hebrews 10:24, he
[1:24:22] said, "Let us consider one another to
[1:24:24] provoke unto love and to good works." He
[1:24:26] said, "Not forsaking the assembling of
[1:24:28] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:24:30] is, but exhorting one another." That's
[1:24:33] what I'm doing this morning. Exorting
[1:24:35] one another. so much more as you see the
[1:24:37] day approaching. So, AS WE GET CLOSER TO
[1:24:39] THE END TIME, WE SEE THE THINGS HAPPEN
[1:24:41] that we've seen happen even this year.
[1:24:42] Let's just get that much closer TO GOD.
[1:24:45] LET'S DRAW UP closer to one another.
[1:24:46] Could we do that as we're nearing the
[1:24:48] end of time? LET'S GET TOGETHER THAT
[1:24:50] MUCH more
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; as we see the day approaching. We want
[1:24:54] to do that for our young people. You're
[1:24:55] going to see a change in our youth
[1:24:57] activities. We're going to ramp up our
[1:24:59] youth meetings more often and things.
[1:25:01] And we're going to do that because the
[1:25:03] ch the kids need to be together.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; They need to hear the word. We're going
[1:25:07] to have youth Bible studies and things.
[1:25:08] Brother Josh Kathy's coming. We'll have
[1:25:10] another ministry will be available to
[1:25:12] help in some of those things. And I I'm
[1:25:14] thankful for that. I I just I believe
[1:25:16] the Lord has a way of just providing
[1:25:18] what we have need of. And a lot of these
[1:25:20] young people just now getting old enough
[1:25:21] to participate in that. And I'd say as
[1:25:24] parents, we have a responsibility. We
[1:25:26] can't I know you can't do everything but
[1:25:28] we have a responsibility to try to keep
[1:25:29] our kids involved in those things
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; because it matters to our kids
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; right you don't want your kid to feel
[1:25:36] like well I never get to go I'm not a
[1:25:38] part no let them be one of one of the
[1:25:40] group let them let them participate and
[1:25:42] I know that's difficult if you live far
[1:25:43] away but every time you can do it let's
[1:25:45] do it let's do our best people have to
[1:25:48] work and brother Brandham interpreted
[1:25:50] that scripture in Hebrews 10:25 he said
[1:25:52] don't stay home we could just stop that
[1:25:54] quote right
[1:25:57] Don't stay home. And again, people have
[1:25:59] to work. Some live far away from the
[1:26:01] church. Sometimes we get sick. People
[1:26:02] do.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Uh sometimes we get an ox gets in the
[1:26:06] ditch.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; There's a couple Sundays a year usually
[1:26:09] that I'll take off.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Because I just get overwhelmed. And I
[1:26:12] don't know any other way to say that.
[1:26:14] I'm human being
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; and sometimes I just get overwhelmed.
[1:26:18] But so I understand people are gone.
[1:26:19] Sometimes people go on vacation, but
[1:26:21] when we can go to church, let's go.
[1:26:23] Yeah.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Let's love one another with all of our
[1:26:25] heart.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if somebody's not in
[1:26:27] church, don't don't criticize them. Pray
[1:26:29] for them.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; You don't know why they might be. There
[1:26:32] might be a sickness. I know I know the
[1:26:33] parties have been dealing with sickness
[1:26:34] with her sister Lena's mother. I know
[1:26:36] some of y'all have been dealing with
[1:26:37] sickness and things. You don't know what
[1:26:39] that person's dealing with. You don't
[1:26:40] know. Man, sometimes depression can keep
[1:26:42] a person out of church.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Anxiety can keep a person out of church.
[1:26:46] Let's pray for them people. Don't push
[1:26:48] on them. Don't don't press them out of
[1:26:50] out of the fellowship. pray for them
[1:26:52] that God will just really get a hold of
[1:26:54] them and deliver them of that thing.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; That there's deliverance this morning
[1:26:57] for those things. But when we can go,
[1:26:59] let's go. Let's be a strength to one
[1:27:01] another.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Say, "How does that give me a crown of
[1:27:06] rejoicing?"
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Because you paying your tithes.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Gives me time to study.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; I'd work a job. I did for for I guess 20
[1:27:16] years of ministry. first 20 years of
[1:27:18] ministry, I I worked a job and I've done
[1:27:21] that all I did that all my life. I'd do
[1:27:23] it now if I had to, but y'all provide me
[1:27:25] a living. So, I I take that seriously. I
[1:27:27] don't just play mess around with that. I
[1:27:29] take it seriously and study like it's a
[1:27:31] job.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; But it matters. It impro I'm not much of
[1:27:35] a preacher, but it does help
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; when you have time to study. Some of our
[1:27:39] brothers aren't full-time. They don't
[1:27:41] have time to study. And so, I don't
[1:27:43] think we ought to be critical of
[1:27:44] ministry either.
[1:27:46] and I think they do a remarkable job.
[1:27:48] But because you've given me that time to
[1:27:50] study and the ability to bring in other
[1:27:52] ministry, we have brothers like brother
[1:27:54] Andrew Glover and and brother Daryl Ward
[1:27:56] and people come in here to the church.
[1:27:57] We have our meetings every year. I don't
[1:27:59] ask you for money on that. We take up an
[1:28:01] offering in the meeting and every year
[1:28:03] we we spend we spend a lot of money on
[1:28:05] that, but I'll say it every dime of it's
[1:28:07] worth it because we've seen souls won to
[1:28:09] the kingdom of God and the church
[1:28:11] revived and people healed. And I think
[1:28:13] it's worth it, church. Yes,
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; it's worth it.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; But you paying your tithes lets that
[1:28:19] happen. We couldn't have the meetings we
[1:28:21] do without you being faithful.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; The ability to do that. That a ministry
[1:28:25] that could speak a word in due season
[1:28:27] that might change your life. God will
[1:28:30] lay it ON MY HEART TO HAVE A PREACHER IN
[1:28:31] OR HAVE ONE OF THESE BROTHERS PREACH AND
[1:28:33] MAYBE I COULDN'T SPEAK TO THAT that that
[1:28:35] certain spot IN YOUR LIFE, BUT THEY
[1:28:37] SPEAK TO IT AND IT CHANGES YOU. IT MAKES
[1:28:39] A DIFFERENCE, CHURCH.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:43] you given an offering. Let's just have
[1:28:45] this place we can come together. Are you
[1:28:47] thankful for the church or thankful for
[1:28:49] the house of worship that we have? Some
[1:28:51] place that's consecrated to the Lord. I
[1:28:52] know people who've had to set up and
[1:28:54] tear down church for years
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; because they never had a building. But
[1:28:57] y'all have put together a place that you
[1:28:59] guys did that. I'm thankful for that.
[1:29:02] You give offerings and things so that we
[1:29:04] can have a place where the lights are on
[1:29:05] and it may be hot or cold, not to our
[1:29:07] liking, but we do have heating and AC,
[1:29:10] right? and we give an offering for that
[1:29:13] and it's consecrated to the Lord. An
[1:29:15] atmosphere can be set that sons and
[1:29:17] daughters CAN BE BORN IN AND WE COME IN
[1:29:19] AND WORSHIP together and you see your
[1:29:21] children down here in the altar. You
[1:29:22] don't REALIZE IT'S A DIRECT CORRELATION
[1:29:24] BETWEEN THAT a and the and the thing
[1:29:27] you're putting into the church. You
[1:29:29] putting YOUR YOU SAY, "BUT ALL I DO IS
[1:29:31] PAY MY TITHE. ALL I DO IS GIVE AN
[1:29:33] OFFERING. ALL I DO IS SHOW UP IN
[1:29:34] CHURCH." THAT'S ENOUGH TO BE A PART OF
[1:29:36] THE BODY.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? AND WHEN YOU'RE A
[1:29:41] PART OF THE BODY, YOU EVERY VICTORY THAT
[1:29:44] THE BODY HAS, THAT'S YOUR VICTORY.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "WELL, I'M NEW." IT
[1:29:52] DON'T MATTER IF YOU'RE NEW. IT DON'T
[1:29:53] MATTER IF YOU'RE OLD. IT DON'T MATTER IF
[1:29:54] YOU'RE YOUNG. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT YOU
[1:29:55] ARE. BUT YOU ARE A PART OF THAT VICTORY.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; There are people who are now in the
[1:30:00] grave who are a part of the victory that
[1:30:02] we have here today.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Who are part of this because they were
[1:30:05] faithful in their generation. Lord, HELP
[1:30:07] ME TO BE FAITHFUL IN MY GENERATION.
[1:30:09] RIGHT.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I think about some of them
[1:30:14] often. I don't want to get to calling
[1:30:16] names because I'll miss some of them.
[1:30:17] But my my mind right then went to
[1:30:19] brother Ruby Wade and and his
[1:30:20] faithfulness to the house of God and his
[1:30:22] faithfulness. I watch him sit there and
[1:30:24] listen to me preach many times. His
[1:30:25] faithfulness in this church and many of
[1:30:27] your mothers and fathers and people that
[1:30:28] came that matters to the house of God.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; That matters to what we do today. Their
[1:30:33] our victory is their victory.
[1:30:36] As we get closer to the coming OF THE
[1:30:38] LORD, THERE WILL BE A GROUP OF people
[1:30:39] who will be alive and remain at the
[1:30:41] coming OF THE LORD. AND OUR VICTORY AT
[1:30:43] THAT MOMENT IS A VICTORY FOR THOSE WHO
[1:30:45] WENT AHEAD BY way of the grave.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful for that.
[1:30:52] You being here makes a difference in the
[1:30:54] atmosphere.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It makes a difference. Don't ever let
[1:30:58] the devil tell you it doesn't.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Your prayers and your worship influence
[1:31:02] a stranger among us. I hope brother
[1:31:04] Jeremy don't mind me saying this, but he
[1:31:06] brother uh
[1:31:09] Wednesday night, brother Jason mentioned
[1:31:11] brother Jeremy's testimony and brother
[1:31:13] Jeremy told me he said it, I'm
[1:31:15] paraphrasing, but he said it wasn't real
[1:31:16] so much the preaching.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I saw a group of young
[1:31:20] people that had something I didn't."
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; If they weren't there, how could he see
[1:31:27] it?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; You realize, you young people realize
[1:31:30] you going to camp, you say, "I don't
[1:31:31] need camp anymore. I got the Holy Ghost
[1:31:33] last camp. Well, you don't have to go to
[1:31:35] camp to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; But you realize you being at camp makes
[1:31:39] a difference.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Makes a difference for our younger ones
[1:31:42] that are just starting and are nervous
[1:31:43] and you can help them out. It helps
[1:31:45] helps that you go you going to camp
[1:31:47] makes a difference
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; because you being there might help set
[1:31:50] that ATMOSPHERE JUST LIKE YOU WERE
[1:31:52] HELPED by that atmosphere. Others are
[1:31:54] helped by that atmosphere.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And there's a crown of rejoicing with
[1:31:58] that.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's a crown of rejoicing with
[1:32:01] that. that that you can you you can say,
[1:32:03] "LORD, THAT SOUL THAT WAS WON AT CAMP,
[1:32:06] IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE I WAS THERE. THAT
[1:32:08] SOUL THAT WAS BORN ON SUNDAY MORNING AT
[1:32:10] CHURCH WAS PARTLY BECAUSE I WAS THERE.
[1:32:12] YOU MAY NOT HAVE SUNG. YOU MAY NOT HAVE
[1:32:14] PREACHED, BUT YOU WERE THERE."
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Help set that atmosphere.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Those young people mattered. They made a
[1:32:22] difference in the life of another young
[1:32:23] person. You young people matter.
[1:32:28] That's why it matters how you treat one
[1:32:29] another.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Don't you let me hear that that that
[1:32:34] you're making fun of one another and
[1:32:35] putting one another down. Don't you do
[1:32:37] that.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Just because a kid's a little different
[1:32:40] or or maybe has a little bit different
[1:32:41] body or a little different way of
[1:32:43] speaking or something like that. You
[1:32:45] love one another.
[1:32:47] [applause]
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Love one another. It makes a difference
[1:32:50] when you love one another.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Makes a difference how you treat one
[1:32:53] another. It's going to be a crown of
[1:32:55] rejoicing one day. Listen to me. There
[1:32:57] were young people who who who gave me
[1:32:58] the cold shoulder when I was young, but
[1:33:00] there were a FEW YOUNG PEOPLE THAT TOOK
[1:33:02] ME IN and let me be their friend. And in
[1:33:04] church, brother Stewart testified THE
[1:33:05] SAME THING. WE GREW UP in church and
[1:33:07] there were SOME YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HELPED
[1:33:08] US OUT. AND I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THEM.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that I was a part of
[1:33:13] that there. MY CROWN, MY JOY, MY VICTORY
[1:33:16] is theirs as well.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Every soul won by the ministry in this
[1:33:20] church. Yeah.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Every baptism, brother Trip, every
[1:33:25] baptism, every healing
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; that belongs to you.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; It belongs to you.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I'll receive a reward if I'm faithful.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; A crown of rejoicing. But the reward
[1:33:42] will be a new body
[1:33:44] and others with a new body.
[1:33:47] I'll receive that. But you'll receive it
[1:33:50] just as much as I do.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Jaden, do do am I getting
[1:33:54] through? I know I'm laboring in it this
[1:33:56] morning. But am I getting through to
[1:33:57] you? It matters.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It belongs to Sister Janie.
[1:34:04] Was not here this morning, but I thought
[1:34:05] of her when I was when I was typing this
[1:34:07] up and I I I studied on this. It belongs
[1:34:09] sister Janie was faithful to the HOUSE
[1:34:11] OF GOD. AND SHE MAY NEVER SING AND SHE
[1:34:13] MAY NEVER NOT BE VERY LOUD, BUT IT
[1:34:14] BELONGS to her AS MUCH AS IT BELONGS TO
[1:34:16] ANYBODY ELSE. IT BELONGS TO THE ONES IN
[1:34:18] THE BACK. IT BELONGS to the deacons and
[1:34:20] the trustees and and and the people who
[1:34:21] help clean and every single one of you.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Every victory belongs to you.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do you gather jewels for
[1:34:29] your crown? Be faithful to the house of
[1:34:31] God. Be a part of the church. Secondly,
[1:34:33] be willing to serve.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Not everyone has a position or title,
[1:34:36] but everyone has a part.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you being prayerful about
[1:34:40] things. I've I've before several
[1:34:42] different times nominated folks for
[1:34:45] things or asked them if they'd be
[1:34:46] willing to do something and they said,
[1:34:47] "Brother Ben, I don't feel like I'd be
[1:34:48] able to do that." I appreciate that.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you having the willingness
[1:34:52] and and and and that don't mean you
[1:34:54] can't ever do it. Someday you might be
[1:34:55] able to do it.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; And and I'm sure I'd rather have
[1:34:59] somebody like that than somebody that
[1:35:00] was campaigning for the job.
[1:35:02] But but you know, I've had several
[1:35:05] people do that, but you're still a part.
[1:35:07] Just because you have a don't have an
[1:35:08] office in the church don't mean you
[1:35:09] don't have a part. The Bible said by one
[1:35:12] spirit are we all. Someone say all.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Baptized into one body. Whether we be
[1:35:16] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[1:35:18] free have been all made to drink into
[1:35:20] one spirit. He goes on to say the body
[1:35:22] is one not one member but many. He he
[1:35:24] types that the different parts of the
[1:35:25] body. I don't have time to read it now
[1:35:27] but if we jump down to verse 18 he said
[1:35:29] but now hath God set the members every
[1:35:31] one of them in the body as it hath
[1:35:33] pleased him. If he made you an eye, you
[1:35:35] be an I. If he made you an ear, you'd be
[1:35:37] an ear. If he made you a foot, you'd be
[1:35:38] a foot. AND BUT YOU'RE STILL part of the
[1:35:40] body.
[1:35:43] [snorts]
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Every officer of this church is here to
[1:35:45] serve you.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; The pastor's here to serve the people.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; The day I can't do that is the day I
[1:35:53] need to resign.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; The pastor's not I'm not here. You're
[1:35:56] not here to serve me. I'm here to serve
[1:35:57] you. The associate pastor is here to
[1:35:59] serve you. The Sunday school teachers
[1:36:00] are here to serve the people. The
[1:36:02] officers in the church are here to serve
[1:36:03] the people. We got it's a
[1:36:05] responsibility. Yes, it's an honor, but
[1:36:08] it's a responsibility. The Brandon said,
[1:36:10] "You're the one who elects your pastor.
[1:36:12] You elect your trustees. You elect your
[1:36:14] deacons. You elect every office there is
[1:36:15] in this church. You the people. And it's
[1:36:18] YOUR DUTY TO STAND BY THOSE MEN." HE
[1:36:20] SAID, "FOR THEY'LL MAKE MISTAKES."
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; OH, NO.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; REALLY? They're mortal. Well, did you
[1:36:29] think you elected angels?
[1:36:35] They're mortal. They'll make mistakes.
[1:36:37] They're just men. THEY'LL make mistakes.
[1:36:41] But if the president of the United
[1:36:42] States makes a mistake, do we throw him
[1:36:44] out as president?
[1:36:46] Oh, that got quiet, didn't it?
[1:36:49] We forget about it and move on.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Our president just abducted another
[1:36:53] foreign leader. I don't know how to
[1:36:54] think about that, but I'm not qualified
[1:36:56] to think on that level. But
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; but he's still the president,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; right? and and listen but brother
[1:37:04] Brandon that's the way we want to do our
[1:37:06] church now he said I was listening to
[1:37:07] him praise humble brother Neville a few
[1:37:09] minutes ago for those deacons and to
[1:37:10] hear back there a testimony at the door
[1:37:12] from the trustees how that with one
[1:37:13] accord you all are now stay that way you
[1:37:16] remember stand by these trustees deacons
[1:37:18] and pastor and remember when you get
[1:37:19] this together remember it's the devil's
[1:37:22] business to see that that's broke up the
[1:37:23] devil loves church disputes he hates
[1:37:26] unity he must be really mad this morning
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; cuz he loves church disputes but he
[1:37:31] hates unity, but you taking your
[1:37:33] position makes a difference.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; And you may have a different opinion
[1:37:37] than somebody else. And I know people
[1:37:38] sometimes may vote differently and and
[1:37:40] they think, "Well, everybody else voted.
[1:37:42] There must be something wrong with me."
[1:37:43] No, you may be voting your conscience.
[1:37:44] And that's what you're supposed to do.
[1:37:46] But when the church makes a decision,
[1:37:48] then you back that up,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; right? You back that up as as much as
[1:37:52] you can. Again, he said, "Bless this
[1:37:53] church. It's lovely pastor, deacons,
[1:37:55] trustees, all the board." And remember,
[1:37:56] he was in a church called Fellowship. He
[1:37:58] said, "In this church called Fellowship,
[1:38:00] God, I pray that men and women as they
[1:38:02] walk in the door of this place, they'll
[1:38:03] fall under conviction." Oh, that's my
[1:38:05] prayer here this morning because of the
[1:38:07] lovely order of the Holy Spirit inside
[1:38:09] the building. What they say in the book
[1:38:10] of Acts, when the day of Pentecost was
[1:38:12] fully come, THEY WERE ALL WITH ONE
[1:38:14] ACCORD IN ONE PLACE. They had just had a
[1:38:16] business meeting, by the way. They just
[1:38:18] elected a new a new apostle. AND WHEN
[1:38:20] THEY GOT DONE, then hear down come from
[1:38:23] the sound of heaven as a rushing mighty
[1:38:25] wind and IT FILLED ALL THE HOUSE WHERE
[1:38:26] THEY WERE SITTING. I BELIEVE IT MAKES A
[1:38:28] DIFFERENCE WHEN THE CHURCH IS IN ORDER.
[1:38:30] IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE YOU ARE
[1:38:32] FAITHFUL to the little things.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; You'll have a crown of rejoicing. Those
[1:38:36] of you who are willing to serve,
[1:38:37] there'll be a crown for that. But the
[1:38:39] bill, there's a crown for that. There's
[1:38:40] a crown for each one of you,
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; for being willing to serve.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Lastly,
[1:38:47] there's a crown of rejoicing for living
[1:38:49] the life of Christ.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; You think just just being alive? Well,
[1:38:54] not so much that as being alive in
[1:38:56] Christ.
[1:38:58] Right? Your walk with the Lord. So him
[1:39:00] living in you.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; See, by receiving the new birth, you
[1:39:03] begin to live the life of Christ.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Paul says it this way, you are epistle
[1:39:07] written in our hearts, known and read of
[1:39:10] all men.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; John 14:12 says, "Verily, verily, I say
[1:39:15] unto you, he that believeth on me, the
[1:39:17] works that I do shall he do also, and
[1:39:19] greater works than these shall he do,
[1:39:20] because I go to my father." He said the
[1:39:23] greater works was to have the power in
[1:39:24] the church not only to heal the sick by
[1:39:26] prayer and cast out devils by prayer but
[1:39:28] to impart eternal life to believers.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Now stay with me for a minute. We're
[1:39:34] going to close in just a minute. And I
[1:39:36] realize once you've said that you've got
[1:39:37] to close.
[1:39:40] But the greater works he said was to
[1:39:43] impart eternal life to believers. Who
[1:39:45] can do that?
[1:39:47] Think about it. The Holy Ghost was
[1:39:49] coming given in the hands of the church
[1:39:50] to impart life. Give me that next quote.
[1:39:53] Who can do that? Who can do the greater
[1:39:55] works?
[1:39:57] Brother Brandon makes a statement. He
[1:39:58] said, "Can a man do that? Can a man do
[1:40:01] that?" Amen. He said, "What is eternal
[1:40:04] life?" He said, "The life that he lived,
[1:40:05] the life that was in him, impart to
[1:40:07] impart that to others." He said, "Can a
[1:40:10] man do that?" A son of God can.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; How many sons and daughters of God do we
[1:40:15] have here this morning?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Then you have the power to IMPART
[1:40:19] ETERNAL LIFE. HOW do you do that? The
[1:40:21] same way Peter did, right? He told him,
[1:40:23] "Repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:40:24] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:40:26] remission of sins." But you say, "Well,
[1:40:27] I'm not a preacher. I can't do what
[1:40:28] Peter did." But you point people to the
[1:40:30] place.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; JUST BY INVITING SOMEBODY TO CHURCH,
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; you have the ability to impart eternal
[1:40:37] life if they'll OBEY THE WORD.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; IT'S not a mystical something. Brother
[1:40:41] Brandon said it's not that I give you
[1:40:42] life and I give you life. That's not it.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; But it's by you obeying the word, you
[1:40:46] get you create an atmosphere other
[1:40:48] people can obey the word. WELL, I SAY,
[1:40:50] GOD, LET US BE FAITHFUL TO OUR PLACE.
[1:40:52] Let's be faithful to our position. Let's
[1:40:54] be faithful so we CAN IMPART ETERNAL
[1:40:56] LIFE. DO YOU REALIZE THAT THE SONGS THAT
[1:40:58] YOU SING MIGHT CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE
[1:41:00] WHERE ETERNAL LIFE IS IMPARTED? DO YOU
[1:41:02] REALIZE YOUR PART IN THE WORSHIP SERVICE
[1:41:04] IN CONGREGATIONAL WORSHIP MIGHT CREATE
[1:41:06] AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IMPARTS ETERNAL LIFE?
[1:41:08] I I tell you what we want today. We
[1:41:11] don't want a nickel system where there's
[1:41:12] power in the pulpit but no POWER IN THE
[1:41:14] PEW. WE WANT POWER IN THE PEW TODAY. WE
[1:41:16] WANT TO SEE THE PEOPLE interact in the
[1:41:18] service. BE A PART OF WHAT GOD'S DOING.
[1:41:21] THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME. IT'S NOT ABOUT
[1:41:22] BROTHER JOEL. IT'S NOT ABOUT BROTHER
[1:41:23] STEWART. IT'S NOT ABOUT ANY OTHER
[1:41:25] BROTHER THAT STANDS HERE. THIS IS ABOUT
[1:41:27] SOULS BEING won to the kingdom of God.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; HOW DO WE DO THAT? BY BEING THE CHURCH.
[1:41:35] [snorts]
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Bible tells us we're the salt of the
[1:41:38] earth.
[1:41:41] But if the salt had lost his savor, see
[1:41:45] salt over time
[1:41:47] loses its ability to have any make a
[1:41:49] difference.
[1:41:51] [snorts]
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Oh God, say God reinvigorate my life.
[1:41:57] Make me salty again.
[1:42:00] [snorts] Where which shall it be salted
[1:42:01] as forth good for nothing but to be cast
[1:42:03] out be trodden underfoot of men? They
[1:42:04] use salt in the roaming the highways
[1:42:08] just trotting underfoot. [snorts] Salt
[1:42:10] saves by contact.
[1:42:13] It creates thirst.
[1:42:16] Oh, and we know the fountain of life.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; So, do you realize how much power there
[1:42:20] is in an individual who has the ability
[1:42:23] to create thirst?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us to let our speech be
[1:42:30] always with grace, seasoned with salt.
[1:42:34] Yeah.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Seize. I say, "Lord, reseason me today.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Reese my speech where I'm not negative
[1:42:41] all the time." You young people, it
[1:42:42] matters how you talk in your own home.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; That might make a difference to your
[1:42:46] parents, you you elders. IT MIGHT MAKE A
[1:42:48] DIFFERENCE TO those around you. It might
[1:42:49] make a difference to the people uh all
[1:42:52] around you that that that they know that
[1:42:54] you're saying the right thing at the
[1:42:55] right time.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; You being POSITIVE TO YOUR WIFE OR TO
[1:42:59] YOUR HUSBAND OR to your children makes a
[1:43:01] difference.
[1:43:03] Let your speech be with grace, seasoned
[1:43:06] with salt. You may know how you ought to
[1:43:08] answer every man. Let your speech be
[1:43:10] seasoned by the way that you live. So,
[1:43:14] it's one thing for me to say something.
[1:43:15] It's another thing for me to say it and
[1:43:17] do it.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; In Revelation one, I'm going to close
[1:43:23] with this. In Revelation one, his voice
[1:43:26] was the voice of many waters.
[1:43:29] his voice. John sees him there with his
[1:43:33] feet like brass and all the wonderful
[1:43:35] that that white wig on him and coming as
[1:43:37] a judge. He sees him and when he sees
[1:43:40] him, he said he fell down like dead.
[1:43:42] Such a glorious sight. But when he
[1:43:44] spoke, it was the voice of many waters.
[1:43:48] Revelation chapter 1, the voice of many
[1:43:51] waters.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said that was the voice
[1:43:55] of the ministry.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know he said that? the voice of
[1:43:59] the ministry down through the ages. The
[1:44:01] voice of many waters is the voice of the
[1:44:03] ministers through the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. He but he he said
[1:44:07] this about that. He he he expanded it
[1:44:09] beyond the ministry to a LIFE BECAUSE
[1:44:13] YOUR LIFE HAS A VOICE.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Pe if your speech is not seasoned by
[1:44:19] your life, people don't believe you.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; That's why it BOTHERS ME SO MUCH WHEN
[1:44:24] PEOPLE CALL BROTHER BRANDON a hypocrite.
[1:44:26] was not a hypocrite.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; When he was alive, he said, "Not even my
[1:44:29] critics call me that."
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; He lived what he preached.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; We live what we preach.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; And if we don't, IF WE FAIL, we repent.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; SAY, "GOD, HELP ME THAT MY MY LIFE can
[1:44:42] season WHAT I SAY." WHY WOULD YOUR KIDS
[1:44:44] LISTEN to you? You tell them, "DON'T GOD
[1:44:46] DON'T like it when you lose your temper.
[1:44:47] God don't like it when you when you say
[1:44:49] that CUSS WORD. GOD DON'T LIKE IT WHEN
[1:44:50] YOU DO THIS, THAT, OR THE OTHER." WHY
[1:44:52] WOULD YOU Why would they listen to you
[1:44:53] if you don't do it? THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME IF I DON'T DO
[1:44:58] IT?
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU with me now? But brother Brandon
[1:45:02] SAID, "IF YOU'RE A PREACHER, YOU'RE
[1:45:03] called to the pulpit to preach."
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; If you're not, you're still a preacher.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:45:17] How many preachers do we have this
[1:45:18] morning?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; See, there wasn't just preachers in the
[1:45:22] upper room.
[1:45:23] There was 120 men, women, children.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; But they all received the baptism of the
[1:45:30] Holy Ghost
[1:45:32] and they all mattered. THEY WERE ALL IN
[1:45:34] ONE ACCORD
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; IN ONE PLACE. AND THEY WERE THE VOICE OF
[1:45:39] MANY WATERS.
[1:45:41] WHAT? LISTEN, it was not this this is
[1:45:44] fresh. I didn't think I never thought
[1:45:45] about this, BUT IT WAS NOT Peter's
[1:45:47] preaching that attracted the people.
[1:45:49] It was them staggering like drunk men.
[1:45:52] Yeah.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Peter's preaching that
[1:45:54] attracted them. Peter's preaching is
[1:45:55] what caused them to know how to be
[1:45:56] saved. But the thing that attracted
[1:45:58] their attention, oh my, was 120 people
[1:46:02] under the influence OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:46:04] IT WAS THEIR WALK.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, COULD YOU JUST RECOGNIZE THAT TODAY?
[1:46:10] IT'S NOT THE THING THAT'S ATTRACTING THE
[1:46:12] PEOPLE TO THE CHURCH. IT'S NOT ME. IT'S
[1:46:14] NOT THE PREACHERS. IT'S YOUR WALK.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; GOOD. I hope you're hearing me today. If
[1:46:23] you're a preacher, you're called to the
[1:46:24] pulpit to preach. If you're not, YOU'RE
[1:46:25] STILL A PREACHER, BUT LIVE THE PEOPLE of
[1:46:27] sermon. LET YOUR SERMON BE LIVED. THAT'S
[1:46:30] WHY I DON'T BELIEVE WE should be some
[1:46:32] cult pulled off in the woods somewhere
[1:46:33] away from everybody. We should live
[1:46:35] among the people. Let your SERMON BE
[1:46:37] LIVED. AND IT'S THE VOICE OF GOD THAT'LL
[1:46:39] BRING REPROACH TO THEM WHO REJECT IT.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; THEY SAY NO ONE COULD PUT A FINGER ON
[1:46:44] HIS OR HER LIFE. THEY'RE SWEET, LOVING.
[1:46:45] If there ever was a man of God, it's
[1:46:47] that man or that woman. See, LIVE YOUR
[1:46:48] SERMONS. DON'T TRY TO PREACH THEM IF
[1:46:51] YOU'RE NOT CALLED TO BE A PREACHER. You
[1:46:52] get all mixed up anyhow. He said messed
[1:46:54] up. You'll get people tangled UP. YOU
[1:46:56] WON'T KNOW. WELL, YOU'LL RUIN them and
[1:46:57] yourself, too. How many times have we
[1:46:59] seen that?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; He said, just live your sermon. THE
[1:47:01] PREACHERS CALLED TO PREACH IS AND TO
[1:47:03] LIVE IT, TOO. IF YOU CAN'T LIVE IT, STOP
[1:47:05] PREACHING IT. BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
[1:47:06] LIVE YOUR SERMONS.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He said, "Oh, how we need in
[1:47:11] Jeffersonville." I wonder if we can make
[1:47:13] that this place this morning. I know
[1:47:15] you've heard it many times. WHY DON'T WE
[1:47:16] HEAR IT THIS MORNING WITH FRESH ears
[1:47:18] that we realize we are part of that
[1:47:20] body? Oh, how we need IN HEARTY ARKANSAS
[1:47:23] THOUSANDS of lived voices. THE THUNDER
[1:47:26] OF GOD THUNDERING OUT IN sweetness and
[1:47:28] holiness and purity. UNDEFILED LIVES
[1:47:30] WALKING AROUND IN THE EARTH TODAY
[1:47:32] WITHOUT A BLEMISH. YES, SIR. REAL
[1:47:34] CHRISTIANS, THAT'S THUNDER AGAINST THE
[1:47:35] ENEMY.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; GOOD.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Your life matters to me.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Watch my son become a young man that
[1:47:48] loves the Lord. And that matters to me.
[1:47:49] It encourages me.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Watch my daughters become ladies that
[1:47:53] love the Lord. That encourages me. You
[1:47:56] young people, I watch you. I watch some
[1:47:57] of you families. You begin to serve the
[1:47:59] Lord. You begin to come to the house of
[1:48:00] God. That encourages me. It means the
[1:48:03] word works.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Your walk made a difference to me.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Today, Sister Betty, you showing up at
[1:48:09] church made a difference today. Every
[1:48:12] one of you that you being in the house
[1:48:13] of God makes a difference.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Walking in sweetness and holiness and
[1:48:19] purity.
[1:48:21] Don't think it don't make a difference.
[1:48:24] That's a lie of the devil.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; I watch some of you change. There's a
[1:48:28] difference.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Some of you work out in the public and
[1:48:33] and and you don't think how much of a
[1:48:35] difference you make, but you're
[1:48:36] different from the world.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, the girls are not just
[1:48:39] not the boys." know the boys are
[1:48:41] different.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; And we can tell I've had ministers come
[1:48:45] to me and talk about young men in this
[1:48:47] church and say they live
[1:48:50] they're they're I can tell they're
[1:48:52] Christians.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; I can tell they they really love the
[1:48:55] Lord because I met THEM AT WORK. I SAW
[1:48:57] THEM AT WORK AND I SAW THEIR ATTITUDE
[1:48:58] AND THE WAY THEY TREATED PEOPLE AND I
[1:49:00] KNOW THERE'S A Christian there.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; It makes a difference.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Walking around in the earth without a
[1:49:08] blemish. Real Christians. That's thunder
[1:49:11] against the enemy. How should we do
[1:49:13] that? How should we gain a crown of
[1:49:15] rejoicing? Live a life so there's no
[1:49:16] difference between preaching and
[1:49:19] practice. Come on.
[1:49:22] Not that we preach something one way and
[1:49:25] then we go out and live any way we want
[1:49:26] to. But let's keep our preaching and
[1:49:27] practice the same.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Not to change the word of God because
[1:49:31] we're going through something, but keep
[1:49:33] our preaching AND OUR PRACTICE SAME. IF
[1:49:34] WE SAY we believe it, let's just believe
[1:49:36] it.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:40] Musicians, go ahead and come. Brother
[1:49:41] Brandham lived it and preached it.
[1:49:46] [snorts] That's why beyond the curtain
[1:49:47] of time.
[1:49:51] He said there was millions.
[1:49:53] Millions.
[1:49:55] Think about that for a minute. But you
[1:49:57] say, "Well, how's that? Well, it made an
[1:49:59] impact in your life. How did the message
[1:50:01] cross your path?" Think about that for
[1:50:03] just a minute. Some of y'all had no
[1:50:05] message teaching or bringing up, but it
[1:50:08] crossed your path somehow.
[1:50:12] Made a difference in your life.
[1:50:15] How did that happen?
[1:50:19] Brother Brandham was faithful in his
[1:50:22] generation to go and millions cried out.
[1:50:27] Right? He said, "I preached what Paul
[1:50:28] preached. I was faithful to the
[1:50:30] scriptures and millions cried out. We're
[1:50:33] resting on that.
[1:50:38] They come up to him and they hugged him.
[1:50:39] They said, "My precious brother." What
[1:50:41] was it? The stars in his crown. His
[1:50:44] crown of rejoicing. He said, "A little
[1:50:47] lady that led to Christ when she was 90
[1:50:49] years old and she was young.
[1:50:52] Some of y'all, you'll have to introduce
[1:50:54] yourself to me because I didn't know you
[1:50:55] when you were young.
[1:50:58] But I want you to come looking for me.
[1:51:04] I believe in it. I've stood by the side
[1:51:07] of too many caskets, preached too many
[1:51:09] funerals to not believe in a
[1:51:10] resurrection.
[1:51:14] They're going to be there on that day.
[1:51:17] And I pray that I've made a difference.
[1:51:20] I might fail in some way and maybe I
[1:51:23] maybe I die in a car wreck or something
[1:51:25] might happen. God forbid. But if I did,
[1:51:27] I pray that I've already made enough of
[1:51:28] a difference.
[1:51:32] That's why we should never sell short.
[1:51:34] Anyone who's ever stood in the pulpit,
[1:51:35] anyone who's ever served as a trustee or
[1:51:37] a deacon, we should give them honor for
[1:51:39] that, respect for that, for what they
[1:51:41] did because it mattered.
[1:51:44] What you do for God matters.
[1:51:50] Even if you're older, you can't do it no
[1:51:51] more. Something's happened, you can't do
[1:51:52] it no more. What you did for God
[1:51:54] matters. If you preach the word, you
[1:51:56] preach the truth, it matters.
[1:51:59] They went and grabbed a hold of me and
[1:52:01] said, "My precious brother,
[1:52:06] there's something in me that longs for
[1:52:08] EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT. I KNOW I I'LL
[1:52:09] never stand in his position. He was a
[1:52:11] messenger to the age. I don't want to be
[1:52:13] that. I don't want that kind of
[1:52:14] responsibility, but let me STAND WITH
[1:52:16] THOSE WHO HAD an influence over."
[1:52:19] I believe when I get there, I'm going to
[1:52:21] see Brother Brandham, but I I don't know
[1:52:22] if that's the first person I'll see
[1:52:24] because I never knew Brother Brandon.
[1:52:26] But there's some I knew.
[1:52:29] I knew Brother Perry Green. Brother
[1:52:32] Perry made a lot of mistakes, but I knew
[1:52:33] Brother Perry made a difference in my
[1:52:34] life.
[1:52:37] I knew some of our loved ones that
[1:52:40] passed on. We buried maybe half the
[1:52:42] church that was at Bransville when I
[1:52:44] pastored there. But those people made a
[1:52:46] difference in my life.
[1:52:49] You made a difference in my life. I
[1:52:52] believe I'm going to see you. If you if
[1:52:53] I pass on or you pass on ahead of time,
[1:52:55] believe I'm going to see you if we both
[1:52:57] go into rapture. We're going to both see
[1:52:58] some people and I'm going to be looking
[1:53:01] for some.
[1:53:04] Brother Daryl Ward, I'm sure, will
[1:53:05] outlive me. But if Brother Daryl goes
[1:53:07] on, I'll be looking for it. Made a
[1:53:10] difference in my life.
[1:53:12] Brother Daryl always told that story. He
[1:53:13] talked about the man walking along. He
[1:53:15] said there was a walking along a beach
[1:53:17] and there's a there was so starfish get
[1:53:19] washed up on the beach and they dry out
[1:53:21] and they die. And he said he just kept
[1:53:23] picking them up and throwing them back
[1:53:24] in the ocean, picking them up, throw
[1:53:26] them back in the ocean. Somebody come
[1:53:27] along and laugh at him and said, "What
[1:53:28] are you doing that for? It don't make a
[1:53:30] difference. There's millions of them."
[1:53:32] He said, "It made a difference to that
[1:53:33] one.
[1:53:36] Made a difference to this one. I'm going
[1:53:38] to be looking for him. I'm be part of
[1:53:40] that crown of rejoicing." Are you with
[1:53:42] me, church? Some have already went on.
[1:53:45] I'm going to be
[1:53:47] my pastor. I had for many years with a
[1:53:50] Bill Ivy who who taught me and and and
[1:53:53] and trained me up and we've not agreed
[1:53:56] on every little thing, but I he made a
[1:53:58] difference in my life. Brother Joel
[1:54:00] testified of his pastor that he had in
[1:54:02] the hot springs made a difference in his
[1:54:03] life. Listen to me, church. You've made
[1:54:05] a difference in my life. I thought of
[1:54:07] brother Paul Seymour. He reminded me of
[1:54:09] it the other day. There's a man by the
[1:54:11] name of I believe it's Kenny Mali. Is
[1:54:12] that right? Kenny Mali was an African
[1:54:15] man. He never met Brother Paul.
[1:54:19] He come by one day and he said he said,
[1:54:21] "The Lord told me you were going to give
[1:54:22] me a job." And he come by there, Brother
[1:54:24] Paul's testimony, HE COME BY and he made
[1:54:27] he he was a real worker. When brother
[1:54:28] Paul finally give him a job, he he he
[1:54:30] made a real he was a real worker. He
[1:54:32] said, "I've seen Christ in him." AND HE
[1:54:34] BEGAN TO TELL HIM ABOUT THE MESSAGE. AND
[1:54:35] BROTHER PAUL'S here today because a man
[1:54:38] come out of the jungle in Africa. YOU
[1:54:39] DON'T THINK GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING? A
[1:54:41] MAN COME out of the jungle IN AFRICA AND
[1:54:43] PREACHED THE MESSAGE. NOT BY WHAT HE
[1:54:45] SAID. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE WAS A
[1:54:47] PREACHER, but he lived it.
[1:54:50] OH, IN HARDY, ARKANSAS TODAY, WE NEED
[1:54:52] THOUSANDS OF LIVE VOICES. I'LL SAY THIS.
[1:54:55] I don't know if Brother Kenny's still
[1:54:56] alive or what what'll happen there, but
[1:54:59] whichever one of them makes it first.
[1:55:02] I believe Brother Paul's going to go
[1:55:03] looking for Brother Kenny. He Brother
[1:55:05] Kenny may not recognize the difference
[1:55:06] he MADE IN BROTHER PAUL'S LIFE, BUT
[1:55:08] Brother Paul knows it. You may NOT NEVER
[1:55:10] KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOU MADE IN PEOPLE'S
[1:55:12] LIVES, BUT SOMEBODY KNOWS IT. OH, I
[1:55:15] believe there's a crown of rejoicing. I
[1:55:17] want there to be that crown. Live a life
[1:55:20] so somebody is looking for you.
[1:55:25] Eternal [music] life is living for
[1:55:26] others. Would you bow your heads with
[1:55:28] me? I want someone to look for me.
[1:55:32] Say, "If you had never lived,
[1:55:35] we wouldn't be [music] here.
[1:55:42] You make a difference to your children.
[1:55:46] I'm not trying to make you emotional
[1:55:47] today. I'm trying to help you
[1:55:48] understand.
[1:55:52] Some of you young couples with babies,
[1:55:54] you make a difference to those babies.
[1:55:55] Don't give up.
[1:55:58] Persevere.
[1:56:01] Make a difference. It'll matter. The
[1:56:05] world may never see it.
[1:56:07] Your name may never be in marquee
[1:56:10] letters, but you made a difference.
[1:56:15] I'll say this today. I've got some
[1:56:17] things to say at the memorial service
[1:56:18] for Sister Cletus, but
[1:56:21] she was a piano player. A lot of people
[1:56:23] didn't know that. Sister Cletus didn't
[1:56:25] know that.
[1:56:28] She started playing piano as we just sit
[1:56:31] and wait on the spirit this morning with
[1:56:33] our heads bowed.
[1:56:35] Sister Cleth
[1:56:37] learned to play piano because there was
[1:56:40] nobody else to do it.
[1:56:42] And she was probably never that good,
[1:56:45] but she loved to play [music]
[1:56:48] because it was something she could do to
[1:56:50] help. She made a difference.
[1:56:53] I spent 5 years there and we wouldn't
[1:56:55] had a piano player without her. Made a
[1:56:57] difference in my life.
[1:56:59] Church, it matters.
[1:57:02] What shall I do, brother? Live your
[1:57:03] life. Live, live so that when you pass
[1:57:07] on, somebody will say, "I'm going to go
[1:57:08] looking for you."
[1:57:12] Make the little sacrifices now. It'll be
[1:57:14] worth it all over there. Lay up your
[1:57:15] treasures over there, not over here.
[1:57:20] Make a difference in somebody's life.
[1:57:22] Can we pray? Maybe you like to slip up a
[1:57:24] hand to the Lord. Say, "Brother Ben, I I
[1:57:26] want somebody come looking for me. I
[1:57:28] want a crown of rejoicing. YOU MADE A
[1:57:30] DIFFERENCE. You're being faithful. you.
[1:57:33] God bless those hands and my hands are
[1:57:35] up. I listen, it'll be some of you with
[1:57:37] greater crown than I have with more
[1:57:40] people over there than I have because of
[1:57:41] the way that you lived and the people
[1:57:43] that you contacted at the bank or at the
[1:57:45] factory or or or washing the dishes,
[1:57:48] whatever it WAS THAT YOU DID. SOME OF
[1:57:49] YOU MOTHERS WITH your families, you made
[1:57:50] a difference
[1:57:52] in their life. Oh God, I want to be I
[1:57:56] want to live like that. Lord Jesus,
[1:57:58] [music]
[1:57:59] I pray that we would not be so
[1:58:01] self-involved
[1:58:04] and so worried about how Lord that
[1:58:07] whether we got recognition that we
[1:58:10] wouldn't understand, oh God, that there
[1:58:11] is a place where every every little
[1:58:14] thing is marked down as we preached last
[1:58:16] week, Lord, that the bad has been cut
[1:58:19] out, the evil has been taken off our
[1:58:22] record. And I'm so thankful for that,
[1:58:23] Lord. But you said we would stand before
[1:58:26] that throne but with an answer for both
[1:58:29] good and bad. And what happens to the
[1:58:31] good? I pray, oh God, that we would gain
[1:58:33] a reward, Lord. Not monetary, not not
[1:58:36] some kind of gold crown. As the old
[1:58:39] brother said, Lord, that Lord, that that
[1:58:41] he got to a place where he was dying AND
[1:58:43] THEY SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO have a robe
[1:58:44] and a crown." He said, "Don't tell me
[1:58:46] about no robe and crown." Said, "Just
[1:58:48] let me look at him. Let me see his face,
[1:58:51] Lord. I want to see your face. I want to
[1:58:53] see the faces of these people, Lord. May
[1:58:55] they everyone make it. If there be one
[1:58:58] here this morning that's never given
[1:58:59] their life to you. I pray they'd
[1:59:00] completely surrender to you today. May
[1:59:03] there may there be a difference made,
[1:59:05] Lord, because of our faithfulness in
[1:59:06] this service. Lord, I I didn't do the
[1:59:08] best job, but Lord, I stood when you
[1:59:10] asked me to stand and I'm here, Lord. I
[1:59:12] stood for you. Would you stand for me? I
[1:59:15] pray you, Grant. Lord God, I pray you'd
[1:59:17] move in this service or move in our
[1:59:19] church as we begin a NEW YEAR. OH, GOD.
[1:59:21] May we be that much more consecrated.
[1:59:23] May we may we have a depth to us, Lord,
[1:59:25] that we've never had. Lord, a rejoicing
[1:59:27] that we've never had, an understanding
[1:59:29] of the times that we live in, OH GOD.
[1:59:31] GIVE US REVELATION, LORD. GIVE US
[1:59:33] STRENGTH TO PURSUE THE BATTLE. OH GOD,
[1:59:35] LET US FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT of faith
[1:59:37] like never before. As we reach the end,
[1:59:39] may we not go down WITH THE WORLD, BUT
[1:59:41] MAY WE BE OF THOSE, LORD, THAT BRIDE
[1:59:43] THAT WAS marching up. I pray you grant
[1:59:45] it, Lord. One day we'll start to see our
[1:59:47] loved ones. I believe it with all of my
[1:59:49] heart, oh God. I pray you'd grant it
[1:59:51] today. We thank you for all that you've
[1:59:53] done. Bless these people, Lord. If
[1:59:54] there's one, Lord, maybe feeling a
[1:59:56] little low, maybe not feeling apart. I
[1:59:58] pray you'd help them to recognize, God,
[1:59:59] that they are a part of the body of
[2:00:01] Christ. Grant it, Lord, we pray. Thank
[2:00:05] you for them, oh God. We pray in Jesus
[2:00:08] name.
[2:00:09] Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] Hallelujah.
