something to us when we sing about your love and your goodness to us lord what an awesome feeling of your presence today we know it's not about feeling but we're glad that you let us feel you once in a while or you just let us get a glimpse of what it's going to be like to sit there at your throne or to know that all of our troubles are passed all of our worries are gone i'm so thankful for that today i pray for these that have lost loved ones lord lord the tragedy of an accident i pray for those that are lord are sick today i'm so thankful for those that you brought back among us lord we we thank you for every day that we have lord there's not a day that we want to take for granted if we wake up in the morning and say thank you lord for life today lord i pray for these hands that were raised and you know the secret of every heart i pray lord that you speak directly to those situations today lord that you would comfort the hearts and help them to know by faith lord that all of these things they can have if they believe when they ask or do you know what what the need is and you're able to meet it we thank you for it today now help me lord move me out of the way lord and speak your word we pray in jesus name amen amen hebrews chapter 11 we'll read verses one through five actually through verse six excuse me for being a baby this morning i just love the presence of the lord amen i hope we all do i we don't all show it in the same way but there's just something about the presence of the lord and we want to always be in his presence hebrews 11 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his test his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning how many of you have ever seen an impala in a zoo i don't mean the car but an impala in a zoo it's like a deer it's got two antlers you've seen an impala you little ones have seen an impala have you ever wondered why they don't just jump the fence some of these zoos have three foot fences and impalas can jump 10 feet high and jump for a distance of 30 feet now think about that for a minute and they can keep him behind a three foot wall and i've wondered about that and i think i've mentioned it to you before but it just it's always amazing to me that they can keep them behind that wall but the truth is the impala will not jump unless they can see where their feet are going to land so they have to be able to see it and that three foot wall is enough to obstruct their vision where they don't have confidence that when they land that they'll actually have a stable footing and so they don't jump now that's very much like what faith is to the christian this morning because faith is the sense that tells us where our feet will fall though we can't see it though we can't feel it though we can't touch it right though though we can't smell it or we can't contact him by the five senses yet we know it's not a supposition it's not a theory it's not thinking that maybe it happens but it's an understanding it's a knowledge it's a it's a reality it's a revelation brother joe that my feet will fall on firm ground if i jump into the promises of god so it tells us if we take the leap if we jump that's what i want us to do this morning as we talk once again about contacting our heavenly home i want us to take that leap of faith and jump into the promises of god don't be afraid don't step back don't don't walk away from it but come right up to it be a real christian don't don't be afraid to be a christian don't be afraid what people might say but take that leap of faith because you really know you know god will take care of you how many know that this morning god will take care of me on the other side i'm going to go to church because god will take care of me i'm going to live for god because god will take care of me i'm going to believe for my healing because he'll take care of me i know my feet will fall in a firm place in a solid place because god said so that's faith yes you know it you don't think it you know it amen and before maybe you were a christian you you thought well maybe god will help me maybe god will save me maybe god but once you have faith you know he'll help you you know he saved you yes sir you know what he's done in your life and it gives you confidence to say lord i believe not only what you have done but what you're going to do for me i see a future not just a past i'm not bound to the pastor but i have a future oh aren't you glad for that today that's what faith is so now last week we learned that there's five senses of the natural body and there's five senses of the spirit realm and you can go back and watch that or listen to brother branham speak about that in in different sermons that he preached now uh then faith he said it's the sixth sense and i want to dwell on that today it's that sixth sense now we talked about how god uses the sense of hearing to increase faith faith comes by hearing which is a sense of the body one of the five senses but god uses that so we don't reject all hearing but we reject any word that doesn't come from god right we don't reject all feeling right but we reject any feeling that doesn't come from god we don't reject all all of all of our senses but we reject those senses that do not line up with the word only we reject all those senses that are contrary to the word now when brother branham preaches a message called faith is the sixth sense he comes out and tells us right off the bat he said faith is a sense of deliverance it's a sense of deliverance he said it delivers us and rescues rescues from our five senses i love the way he puts this that we were put in in the beginning so he said it actually rescues us from our five senses now have you ever noticed that as a child and many times these children up here sometimes they're easier to preach to because they believe what you tell them right children believe adults have learned to disbelieve now think about we learn unbelief and i want us to understand that today because you have to be careful what you listen to because you learn unbelief you learn to just oh god's not going to take care of me you learn that everything's going to everything i'm going to lose everything everything's going to go wrong and and i'm going to get sick and i'm going to die well you might die you might get sick and die but god's got it god's going to take care of you right are you with me and so but you learn that unbelief you learn it from things you go through you learn it from the feeling that you have in your body you learn it from things you hear but children in most cases especially when they're very very young they haven't learned to disbelieve that's why they'll they'll jump off of a wall right into your arms but it's a little bit harder to get an adult to do that right because they've learned unbelief that's right and so now when it comes to spiritual things that faith actually our our sick sense rescues us from what we've learned it delivers us from what we've learned it delivers us from ideas and creeds of men that cause unbelief to come in our life so denomination teaches that now what they do is they teach through creeds and dogmas they teach unbelief that's right they teach unbelief you say well how do they do that well they teach unbelief by putting the works of god in the past or in the future and saying that he's not the same yesterday today and forever right that's how they teach unbelief now and i'm going to show that to you this morning now it's why it's so important who we yield our sense of hearing to it's so important who we're listening to listen to second timothy chapter 2 and verse 15 paul writing to timothy a young preacher he said study or work that word is to work or or to be diligent to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth don't just get up and spout off but have a basis for it and study for it and find out what god wants you to say and then he said but shun profane and vain babblings i won't make you show a show of hands but you've heard some vain babblings i'm sure i've heard some it was a lot of words but it didn't mean anything and sometimes we preachers get good at that word salad is what they call it our current vice president is very good at it and and so they just say a bunch of words but it doesn't politicians get good at it say about your words but they don't mean anything paul said shun that as a minister shun that and i think his hearers as well we should shun that we don't want to listen to just a bunch of words right that don't mean anything it's not the how many words you say you don't get a reward regardless of what you might what you might think you don't get a bigger crown in heaven because you used more words while you were preaching right but it's what you say not how many words he said shun profane and vain babbling for they will increase unto more ungodliness because you confuse people and there were now watch second timothy 2 17 their word those that that go on like that saying things that aren't in the scripture that aren't true or or that are just irrelevant their word will eat as that's a canker and that's something that gets in your body and then it causes gangrene when it says it'll eat it'll spread through the body their word will eat as does a canker and paul gets pretty serious he names names of whom is hymenius and philetus who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection has passed already now watch how they aired they said the resurrection is past so you've got no hope to look forward to oh my you see what doctrine makes a difference it matters what you hear it matters what you believe it said the resurrection is past and when in doing so they overthrow what do they overthrow the faith yes right and that's why we got to watch what we listen to that's why we gather together here and we don't just all go we could all go and still be christians pers we could say i could go to the baptist church with a joke you go to the methodist church and whether joel could go to the pentecostal church all of you could go to different churches and we we could be just fine probably but we would be hearing a word tainted by denominationalism right god help us that we'd never do that in the message of the hour but when we get our particular idea and that's what's so wrong about there's certain doctrines and you know me i i promote fellowship i believe we ought to get along i think if we're going to get along with over there we might as well get along over here but there are certain doctrines that you can hear certain things certain types of preaching that actually don't help you it actually causes you to disbelieve because it makes you wonder the bible puts it this way it ministers questions yes we didn't we're not called to minister questions god didn't make us apologetics that's not what he called us to do but to proclaim the gospel we're not to apologize for the gospel but to proclaim the gospel because the gospel is the power paul says of christ how many believe that today it's the power of christ amen now so he said they've erred because they said the resurrection is past and they overthrew the faith of some because there are some people in such a bad condition here in this life that their only hope is the resurrection now think about it as you get older and you get you begin to realize that you've got loved ones over there and they say oh it's a spiritual resurrection it's already passed and here's my loved one that went on to be with the lord and how do i have a hope of ever seeing them again unless there's a resurrection how do i have a hope of doing that see again the word matters and if you hear about the resurrection what does that do when i tell you you're going to see your loved ones when you hear it on a tape when you read your bible and you begin to read first corinthians 15 51 begin to read first thessalonians 4 what happens all of a sudden you begin to click with you and you say hey i'm going to see him again paul said don't sorrow like others who have no hope amen but be a believer hallelujah oh i it gives you faith the word gives you faith and that's why some people some families some churches some of us right here sometimes we lack faith because we're listening all the time to unbelief and but you have the ability now watch you might you might come in here but you have the ability to reject it to walk away from it to not hear it right so now watch let's go to the message again where brother brandon preached faith this the sixth sense he said notice that these senses was given to you to only contact your earthly home that you might see taste feel smell in here but they're by no means to lead you by no means to lead you and now many times he said what if i refuse to look anymore and i just bind up my eyes and say i refuse to look all right my eyes can't serve me no more well then finally i'll go blind and watch you say brother ben why i just can't seem to have the faith that i want to but i wonder sometimes if we haven't been blinded and don't realize it because we just haven't exercised our faith in the word he says finally i'll go blind he said and then when my bo my boy comes on now watch so first of all the man is blind because he refused to see there's no one so blind as the man who refuses to see right he said see the blind man naturally would see if he could but here's a man who refuses to see and so he said all right my eyes can't serve anymore finally i'll go blind because i haven't used my eyes and then when my boy comes on i'll tie his eyes up so watch i put a something over my eyes i can't see and then peter comes along and i teach him the same thing i was taught right you can't see either god don't do those things no more you see why it's so dangerous god help us today better watch what we listen to right because there will be if you're around long enough then i'm not old but i've been had a few miles and i've seen a lot i've seen a lot of people get into heresy and into uh into become over-emotional and and get into the things like the sign gifts and things like that to a point where they went completely off the word i've seen it i've seen them go too far but if you don't believe in the gifts at all yeah you cover your eyes yes all right if you don't believe in the moving of the spirit at all you're covering your eyes and you're teaching your children the same thing yes to cover their eyes up so that they can't see but i want to my children to be able to see the same things i see i see a god who still moves i see a god who still delivers yes sir what do you see this morning what do you see can you see a church that's still on fire for god if you can see it you can be it yes but if you can't see it you need to take the blinders off yes sir i see a church that can be on fire for god i see a people who close god with all of their heart i see regardless of the situation that's going on around me i see a future for you you say well i don't have much future i'm getting old but remember even though you're old there's a future for you because you have eternal life i see a future i see i see god moving in his bride you can tell me all day that the bride has failed but i see a word that says this bride would not fall yes sir what am i supposed to believe i'm supposed to look with spiritual eyes so i don't bind the eyes of my children are you hearing me today it's important that we see because whatever condition that we're in our kids will be that plus well that ought to sober us up huh if you get where you can't see this morning by faith you just can't see you put a blind over your kid's eyes you say well i just can't do it well i can do all things through christ who strengthens me now watch he said finally i'll go blind when my boy comes on i'll tie his eyes up and say no sir there's no such thing as sight i'll just tie his eyes up don't let him see well i could get in deep here but i think you can apply it spiritually look don't let him see don't don't go down there don't don't don't don't fellowship with those people because they might try to take that off your eyes by the preaching of the word he said no so there's no such thing as sight i'll tie his eyes up don't let him see he said my father told me there was no such thing as sight yeah now watch so now it's in the third generation my father told me there was no such thing as sight so i'll tie up my boy's eyes oh god he said well the first thing you know our generation would be born blind he said that's right if you don't use your six senses they become dormant they won't act at all yeah he said brother that's what the church has done to the sixth sense god put him in he just placed faith off now watch in miracles and signs in other words only a an apostle only a prophet can do that only only people like that and it's only a special time a special place and only for a pastime or a future time he puts faith off in miracles and science he said in the things that contacts god yeah oh god now see i'm not a prophet and if i put all of my faith in just being able to discern the secret of the heart you understand that god showed us a sign in our day to discern the secret lord but if i put all of my faith in that then i have no faith in what god gave me which is lay hands on the sick yes right call for the elders of the church anoint him with all that and they'll be we should have faith in that and if you watch brother branham and perfect faith he's trying to turn the people to that to where they can just believe when hands are laid on them and even when they don't see the sign and so we're living in that time we don't have brother branham here as a prophet and no one has replaced him right no one will ever replace him but we do have the same god do we believe that this morning if we have the same god he said then the things that contacts god gives him the holy ghost and things now watch he said he placed that off over there or back over there somewhere till the thing has become dead yes right oh god oh and i would say this to you i i think you you shouldn't listen to that right you shouldn't listen that don't if anybody has a right the way that i was raised and the way that things happen in our life and my family my sister is here this morning my brother here i'm thankful for my family but if anybody had a right to reject supernatural things it would be us because the way we were raised some of you come out of similar things and you might reject supernatural things because you think well so and so did it and they were a phony but god's word is still true so and so didn't live it but i can live it come on god put something in me to live it god put something in you to live it amen there will always be a false but the false does not make me reject the real it makes me look harder and search more diligently for the real yes sir amen so now he said the the things that contact scotty he put him off somewhere over there the thing has become dead he said that's right he don't know how to use it and the thing's just nothing to him that's why you can come sit in a meeting you can be a part of a service you just sit there and think well everybody's being blessed and everybody's being helped and i just sit there and nothing i don't feel anything it's not that you have no potential for sight but you haven't used it in so long that you can't see when god's working oh i hope you're hearing me this morning many times god moves in our local services not just in a meeting many times the presence of god is so real that if you just reach out and grab a hold of what god god has for you you could be healed you could be saved you could be delivered do you believe that today many times in our own church service you could be delivered of the things that you have need you could get the things you have need of you can be delivered to the things that bind you if you would just believe but see we don't use our faith because of the time we're living in yeah and this why brother joel it makes it so easy to preach to people who have to use faith because they don't know that the donkey's gonna live through the night so they can get on it right in the morning so to say they don't know the car won't start but they don't some of them don't have cars and if you ever go to places like that and preach to people like that they're expecting god to do something that's right they're expecting god to move and if you can ever get them to understand faith then that's the hard part because they expect him to do it right then yeah right and if you're not careful then you teach them unbelief but you expect you tell them it's not about that but it's about it's about you believing and holding on and then one day those eyes are going to come open one day that that that sickness is going to leave your body because it's like abraham you have the faith and god's testing and trying you and putting you through a test so that he can you can come out on the other side so god can do great miracles but he's always a healer and so but if you talk to those kind of people if you talk to people that don't have nothing they're used to not having nothing they're used to having to get up every morning not knowing they don't have social security yeah they don't there's nobody to catch them you think about a nightmare apocalyptic scenario in this country i've preached to hundreds probably thousands of people over the years that are already in that situation overseas yeah they don't have nothing the situation we think of as an apocalypse they're in it they're living the squeeze yeah some of you that have traveled overseas you know what i'm talking about they're living it but that brother that come to brother paul and told him about the message of the hour that they come to him and witness christ to him that brother come to an oil rig they didn't howard they have shoes on his feet in west africa that man knew something about god knew something about faith are you hearing me today there's there's people out there and i'm not saying that to condemn you because i'm one of you right we're soft it's hard for us to do that we want to know everything we want to have everything put out and laid out in front of us but sometimes god wants you to just get away break away from that another so for us we have to exercise our faith we got to use it we got to put it in motion we got to say lord i don't care what the doctor says i don't care what the people say i don't care what anybody says i believe you lord yeah can we do that this morning i believe you lord amen hallelujah now he said you don't know how to use it things just nothing to him you say well god's a healer oh what about that god's a healer he it just nothing to him but he said if he ever was a healer he's still a healer if he ever was a savior he's still a savior if he ever was god he's still god hold on i want you to watch this so you see he said it's a lack of faith that's been preached into the people oh god that makes them let that sick sense which is by faith lay dormant yes it's a lack of why not believe that we can now the truth is if you say we can't and i say we can the truth is what it is whether we can or we can't that is what it is but if you say we can't and we don't try right if you say it can't be done it means we won't try and if we don't try then we we're guaranteed failure so i would rather try if there was one millionth of one millionth of a chance of success especially when it comes to these important things but we have much more than that we have the word of god itself right which said i'm the god that heals all your diseases i'm the same yesterday today and forever he says those things and he tells us those things and so we have his word we ought to be able to take the leap of faith and believe it but the reason why people don't is that it's a lack of faith that's been preached into the people let's take an example of that in numbers chapter 13 and this is a very familiar story but i want to i'm kind of uh trying to get through this this morning without without wearing you out and brother joel's going to preach this afternoon he asked me not to announce that and i started not to because i was afraid to be more people and it make me feel bad if i announced he was because he was afraid of the opposite thing happening so you all proved come prove one of us wrong but numbers chapter 13 and verse 26 talks about about uh israel when they come to kedish barnea and moses sends out the ten spies now notice they were sent by moses hand-picked to do the job say well i the prophet ordained me moses ordained all 12 spies right he ordained all of them because it was the purpose of god you see why some of these people could hang so close to a prophet and then come off and be wrong in the end you say how could that possibly be god ordained it to be that way that's right right you ordained these men now watch they went and came to moses and to aaron and all the congregation of the children of israel and to the wilderness apparent to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sinnest us and they had to acknowledge now that the word was true and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it what was that fruit it was a bunch of grapes and they brought back the pomegranates and different things but they had a bunch of grapes it was so large it had to be carried on a staff between two men i don't know if you've been to walmart lately but you don't get grapes like that at walmart it'd take all the grapes and all the boxes up here at the ash flat walmart to get enough grapes so that you'd have to carry them like that right but here comes here comes two men walking in a staggering into the camp under the influence of these grapes right and and they're they're coming oh it's a good land it's flowing with milk and honey yes but nevertheless the people be strong well they ought to be strong with eating them kind of grapes maybe we should eat some of what they're eating nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled oh my and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there we saw the children of anac oh my that ought to put some fear in them because they'd heard the children of anak were the amalekites as well in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the methodists and the baptists dwell in the mountains and the pentecostals dwell by the sea don't want to be like them pentecostals [Music] the coast of jordan bring it up to today and caleb i love this what happened to caleb why was he different well number one he had faith he believed god he was god's chosen but i believe that when he was in the land he'd taken advantage not only he did he carry the grapes but he ate some of them amen brother brandon said when you've been eating grapes he said you can tell it yeah you said get grape seeds in your teeth you you get slobbers all over your face why you've been eating grapes and caleb was stimulated oh my by the revelation that they could do it and caleb got all the people quiet he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we'd be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we they were not wrong about that what the only thing they got wrong was the promise i want you to hear me today when you hear this type of preaching or this type of ministry or maybe from the news or or from your family from somebody else well we're not able we're not we're not able you can't live like that today you'll be called an amish person you'll be you'll be some kind of an outcast you you can't live like that you can't be like that when you hear that remember they got everything right except for the promise you will be persecuted but you have a promise you will be laughed at but you have a promise come on there will be sickness there will be trouble there will be struggles there will be people who are false there will be false signs and sensations everything else but there is a promise that you can have the real thing yes are you hearing me today don't let the the hearing about the failure keep you from the promise hearing about the problems keep you from what god promised to do so it says they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it i said bless god we're doctors of divinity and we have our bibles we have our quotes right they've gone up through the land to search it they're not they're not unknowledgeable people that's not a word is it they're not ignorant people here's what i was looking for these are not ignorant people they've went down through the land and looked and examined it sit walls are too big but you see what you want to see see caleb was looking through rose-colored glasses they could accuse him of that and be right you could accuse me of that and be correct brother ben you just don't see the problems brother ben if you were a little bit older if you had a little gray hair if you you'd understand there's problems out here there's trouble there's situations but there's a promise haven't oh god i haven't had it preached out of me yet yeah i still i still could see maybe not as strong as some of you might be able to see but i can still see can you see this morning can you see that the land is flowing with milk and honey but these these learned men these great men walked through the land and said it's just not able we can't do it oh i see where paul did it i see where brother branham did it but for us it's too much we might as well just sit down and wait for the coming of the lord it's too much for us to expect our children to be on fire for god it's too much for us to expect our families to live holy lives too much for us to expect our children to obey boy got quiet but isn't that what said today is too much oh you'll be too hard on your kids if you spank them what does the word say the word says spare the rods full of the child you can even tell me all day long what the psychologist says but the word says and the word never changed that that's right and the prophet updated it to our day and showed us how we wouldn't do that in anger and all of those things but it still has to be done right there's a promise that if we if we guide them in the right way when they're old it doesn't say how but when they're old they will not depart from it oh isn't that a comfort to some of you whose children may be astrayed at times but you see they come back what do they come back to they come back to the word amen give them something to come back to that's what's wrong with this culture today every time the world moves to church moves every time the world gets a little more worldly the church just moves over to it but that's not what we're called to do we're not called to be with the culture we're called to be with the word every time the world moves we just get closer to god yes sir that's what we're called to do yes the culture's gonna move right i've been hearing some strange reports out of the schools and we're gonna pray earnestly with our children this year here at the church before school starts i believe it starts here on the 15th we'll try to do it that sunday some may have already started but you know we want to pray earnestly with our children because i've been hearing some reports that are pretty bad and some awful things that are coming in the land that we're in and some adults that don't have any sense but it seems like our children would even be swallowed up by it yeah and we want to make the best decisions as parents about what we're going to do and where we're going to send them and what we're going to do and all of those things and and yet make sure that they get an education where they can have a job and be able to work and do those things and it's important it's important to do those things but yet but as parents you have to make those decisions i can't do that for you but you look out at the report that's going on and you say well what are we going to do we just going to become more like it more like what where they don't understand which gender they are yeah where they don't understand what species they are we're going to become more like that i'm telling you the gap between us and the canaanites it's going to be so wide oh god it's going to be so wide that it's going to seem like the only way you can't beat them might as well join them but you've got to believe that you can overcome that there will be a bride if you don't believe it you'll never do it why would you teach your children correctly if you don't really believe that's the problem it all boils down to a lack of faith yeah why would you teach your children the right way why teach your children to wear skirts and and wear decent clothing and well i teach your boys not to cuss not to be on video games all day and do those things i teach them right yeah if you don't believe it'll help them but if you believe that there is a better way how many believe you this morning if you believe there's a god who still answers prayer if you believe there can still be a church on fire for god i'm not telling you to be some kind of homicide i'm telling you stay with the word stay with the word stay with what god said if you believe it you can have it he said but you don't know what my past has been if you believe it you can have it today if you oh my i hope you believe it today i don't care what your past has been i don't care how many times you failed i don't care where you've been you may have been in some awful places but i come i come from a broken a broken background in my own psyche my own spirit i come from a broken spirit but that's what god works through he works through a broken spirit and a broken heart i've seen god take men that were on drugs and alcohol and everything else turn around make them preachers why would god use a man like that why would he use a man like that because he wants to show he's still god if he could do it for them he could do it for you i'm convinced that if god could save me he could save anybody well i never thought about myself that way brother ben you'd probably need to yeah paul said i was the chiefest of sinners he had a religious spirit that's the worst one yeah yeah oh god he said look we've gone to search it we're we're learning men we know the message i don't even know where i'm at but you'll hang with me this morning look the land we've searched it out the land eats up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there we saw the giants the sons of anac which come with the giants and we were in our own sight oh god in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight and all the congregation having heard this faith-filled message lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be afraid were it not better for us to return into egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt you think about it where were all the people that here a while back we had a little movement the people that left the message where where did all that come from where what were those people doing before waiting on a leader waiting on a captain yeah one day they said let's make a captain and return to egypt oh but we have a captain too right our joshua the holy ghost is in the land today we have a captain hallelujah listen now this should have been their great hour of victory but they allowed the five senses to rule and the preachers preached the lack of faith into the people but our prophet did not preach a lack of faith but he preached faith yes sir yes he told us about the problems but he preached the promises of god right are you hearing me today i don't say you should be health wealth and prosperity constantly but there's got to be a balance of the if you don't balance the problems with faith you just preach faith right out of the people that's right yes there's problems but we are more than able to take the land amen oh caleb didn't deny that there were giants he didn't deny that there were wild cities we don't deny that it's hard today we don't deny that the world is against us but we have a god who is greater than any problem you're proof of that today church this church is a proof that god is greater than any problem the devil can throw at you we're proof that god forgives that god god heals that god says i hope you're hearing me today we're proof of that each one of you is individuals it's proof of that today that god is a resurrection power our god is a healer our god is a savior each one of you individually can say that don't be afraid to step out on the word of god don't be afraid to give up on your on your earrings and you're cutting your hair and going out don't be afraid be not afraid oh there's a land yonder you can walk into don't be afraid to give up your drinking and you're smoking in your and your cussing and all those things there's a land we can walk into yes sir oh we're gonna walk into a new body one of these days and if you have faith enough to see it today to look beyond the unseen you can see there's a body waiting for you amen hallelujah brother and said oh brother if that sixth sense could understand what we've been preaching about this week that the holy ghost god made this promise christ made the promise he said we took it to the scriptures this week back and forth and back and forth and combed it over until we know that god promised to do this thing he's doing now in this day the supernatural he said now real genuine faith would see that and catch a hold of it and all devils out of hell would never shake him away from it but we stumble at it it's not used enough we depend too much on the five and when most the time to 95 of the people are better as soon as they see the five senses is finished so in other words they can't discern a way out using the senses of the flesh and as soon as they see the five cents of this finish say well it's all gone dig my grave get my casket ready i may have told you before but my dad bless his heart every time he got a cold he rode out his funeral told whose pallbearers would be and who he was upset at at that certain time that would not preach the funeral and who would all of these things he did change all the time i found sadly that i've carried on the tradition i don't write it out but i do plan my funeral i haven't got on paper yet but i've talked about it with my wife especially when i have a cold peter's got that same thing he's died three times with covet already and so you know what we just we just do we might as well might as well just quit dig my grave not the way you get sometime no come on be honest might as well dig my grave i'm done can't offer no more to the church can't no you're struggling yeah you won't struggle forever well you might as well just dig my grave have you got breath left you better be thinking about that next breath what do we preach on here a while back have you got breath you got breath in your body and you got breath to praise the lord amen you can be in the best service you were ever in this morning you could listen you can listen to the best sermon not because i preached it but because you had faith to hear it amen you could this morning faith could come on you and light up your life where you could hear and you could see and you can begin to walk into god in the presence of god this could be your day don't limit it by your five senses and say well today nothing we're not gonna get nothing out of the day don't have no drums stewart's on vacation well it's over dig my grave get my casket ready we don't say that do we use your faith where will i use it brother ben for the trip you use it at school yes that's right you use faith at school to know when to when you what to do and how to how to do your classes and how to get over maybe abuse that you take peter knows about that peter's taking abuse a lot of times i don't mean physical but just just people find out he's a christian he's kind of quiet and tries to get along with everybody and then they see weakness and they come after you and peter's had to deal with that and he told me he's still kind of up in the air i didn't want to see him back to school this year i preached that message wednesday night on the way home peter said i wonder if those kids at school are the ninevites i said i don't know peter i don't know i want to protect you all i can protect you but use your faith if you go to school use your faith when you go to the doctor doctor don't know it all god does use your faith when you read the news oh you really need it when you read the news use your faith when you listen to your pastor use your faith when you listen to other ministry use your faith take the thing off your eyes use your faith lord i believe oh it may not be perfect circumstances but i believe there's a resurrection see unless you use your faith it'll become so dormant that you won't even believe a move of god when you see it the spies tasted the grapes saw the land flowing with milk and honey and still not did not believe they could do it brother branham said we become so earthbound with our senses he said well if i can't see it in them senses the devil gets into those senses and he will let you see something with your eyes and disbelieve it anyhow how many people have we shown i want to show it again to the kids we've shown the film you can find it on youtube brother branham i go back and watch it sometimes just to build my faith i'll go back and listen to prayer lines sometimes just to build my face because sometimes i need that how many times have we seen the film or brother brandon's standing up there and a man is going into another realm and telling people he doesn't know what their name was what their address was what their sickness was but see satan will work on you so much until you can see that and not believe it yeah that's right you can see something science cannot explain and they've been trying to do it for nearly 70 years they've been trying to explain how that gift was there and the charismatic say well he was a prophet but he got off the word and others say well he was just a fortune teller or some other thing they can't explain it but it's written in the word it's so plain isn't it it's so plain but satan will actually get you to disbelieve a prophet if you don't use your faith you can see it right in front of you so he didn't know what he was talking about shame on you god help us today he was a man he made mistakes absolutely he did he didn't he wasn't called to bring thus saith the lord as far as the scriptures he was called to shine a light on the scriptures tell us what it is but he was a prophet of god and we should we should believe that the devil gets you to disbelieve it many times you've kept your eyes closed along until you're blind he said a fellow said to me one time smite me blind smite be blind you believe in divine healing saying that holy ghost said paul preached might be blind i said i can't do it you're already blind i said your father the devil did that a long time ago so you're already blind for the bible said he's blind this gospel is said to anybody if it's hit to anybody it's those that are blind and hasn't tried to use their senses yes the sense of god gave them yes have you ever had your parents tell you that use the sense god gave you i always wanted to say which one we've been taught about the fight which chance am i supposed to use and it seemed like the one he wanted me to use was pain which since use the sense but that's what brother man i'm saying use the sins god gave you what is that faith use faith amen that sense if it's used it's a sense of deliverance oh do you need deliverance today that faith is a sense of deliverance when the other five fail that's why we still have prayer lines we still lay hands on the sick we still believe in the power of prayer why do we still do it he said it's outdated we don't need it no more why do we still do it because we still believe god's word is true yes yes you can receive it sitting right in your seat but sometimes you need a little extra boost of faith and if you need that god's good enough he's not like us he don't just cut people off but he keeps giving and he keeps giving he keeps sending gifts for the ramsay he said if i was god and the people didn't believe me what i said i'd just let him go he said but he keeps sending gifts he keeps sending men down through the age to come and with feelings and with prayer lines and with all kinds of different things he keeps doing it what's he doing he loves you he wants to do everything he can to help your faith but you got to have the faith see if your faith is alive it's not dormant then you go through the prayer line you may not feel anything any different than anybody else but you believe it and then you hold on to it until you get it i gabe and millie aren't here this morning and so i'll talk about them while they're not here they're probably watching maybe here this afternoon they've been sick satan always fights anytime there's a change in your life are you bored this morning i hope you're not anytime there's a change in your life a major change the devil tries to get into that right it's a junction but i'm called a junction you take a new job you marry a wife you marry a husband whatever it is that you do the devil tries to get into that you go through certain seasons in your life menopause for women for men there's a period in their life where they get they don't feel young anymore and and there's a time in your life you go through those changes and satan will work in that try to get you to disbelieve and so gabe and millie i watched as they went through these great changes in their life and satan all the time trying to tell them trying to work on them make them sick make them make them upset do all kinds of things frustrated as they went through the season of their life just keep telling them just believe just believe but i watched them come through the prayer line and sister millie's got some problems in her body and they come through the prayer line and said and she believed it when she come through and said you can tell sometimes when a person really believes that she believed it when she come through and every time i hear from well we're not doing too good today but we believe we got our healing in the prayer line thank god for that don't let colvin steal that from you don't let situation circumstances steal that from you you believe it yes amen and you say well what do i do if i just can't have faith well come back up get prayed for again that's fine it's fine keep seeking it keep pounding on the door keep knocking yeah god will give you that confidence yes brother branham talked about the two women and the angel of the lord how that the two women come to for healing and this is all from the faith is the sixth sense if you go back and listen to it you talked about those two women that were there and they both received healing in the prayer line said you're healed but neither one of them felt any better one couldn't eat the other one had a tumor on her neck he said in one day the angel of the lord passed through their area amen he come to make good on the word glory he come but they'd already been prayed for and they believed it and one day she there was a woman was sitting there she couldn't eat she couldn't drink coffee and she got up and she said i believe i'm healed and she got up and made a pot of coffee and she made some grits or some oatmeal and she began to eat it all of a sudden she could eat it there was no pain and she got so excited she run down the street and this other woman was screaming at the top of her voice that that that goiter that thing had fallen off of her neck oh god the angel of the lord had come to the area but what was he doing making good on their confession he's a high priest of your profession this morning amen and and he said they come to them he said what was it because they held on to that sick sense of the word of god that wouldn't take no for an answer they come to the meeting about two months after that both of them showed me how they were healed and everything what was it the sixth sense that sixth sense that sense of power that thing that delivered them not because i prayed but because they believed that's it that done it you talked about an insane woman i don't have time to get through all of this you talked about an insane woman that come and and her and her husband and they went down in the basement where she was and she'd crawl on her back and and she was a woman that she had a devil that was had possessed her brother brandon prayed for her but she didn't get better right away he prayed for her but then after a few days she she got better but he said about six months after that i was at jonesboro arkansas with richard reed at the old-fashioned revival our tabernacle he said used to be a big baptist tabernacle he said i was starting to preach i kept seeing somebody waving at me i didn't know who it was and she just couldn't stand it no longer she said you remember me had four or five little children i said i don't believe i do she said i never seen you before either she said i was the woman who was on my back crawling oh god listen this woman was completely insane and she would stare on her back crawling and brother branham said he even run from her he said i had to run from her up towards the stairs he said her husband in that six months time had been called to the ministry and he was going out to preach the gospel what is it holding on to that sixth sense faith said so yes and listen what the man said to husband he said i kept that in my heart if god could do such a thing to others now brother branham had told him this person was insane got healed this person was insane he related several stories and the man said if those people got their healing then i can get my healing oh do you still believe that today i believe we ought to tell our testimony when god heals us i believe we ought to wave that that white flag not of defeat but a victory we ought to waive it let people know not in a bragging way but say god did something for me and so he said i kept that in my heart if god could do such a thing to others he can do it for my wife he kept holding on to that nothing would separate him from it that's what the sixth sense will do when it's turned loose oh my let's turn it loose this morning let it have his controlling power he talked about john ryan he said are you okay for five more minutes i won't do you like brother wendell did he got five minutes from each of you he said i want to see that preacher and so they they brought him up there again and he said to me you told me i was healed you remember the story of john ryan he was he was blind he'd come up in the prayer line and brown said you're healed he just walked off but he couldn't see so he come back he said you said i was healed he said you are he said well if i was healed i could see and we had that question similar to that in the prayer line overseas one lady come to me why do i not feel any better well you got to believe it's based on your faith right but many were healed right but you got to believe and sometimes it's delayed now look he said you said i was healed i said you said you believed me he said i do believe you i said then what are you doubting about he said but i don't understand it what shall i do i said well the only thing to do is go on your road just praising god for giving you your eyesight oh some people need to pray about their spiritual eyesight today you need to pray about your faith vision yes he said where are you started pushing on now watch i see sometimes god lets us do something church i want to encourage that i don't want to i don't want to brother branham when he passed through perfect faith you may think that's kind of strange what brother andrew did when he was here with the with the trash can you remember that on a wednesday night you put yourself in a trash can but the brand did that in perfect faith said take it and drop it put it in your pocket bring your troubles up here put them in the box that's what he told the people to do yeah and that's where brother andrew gets that from i'm sure and so you you take that and and you uh he's just give him something because and there's no virtue in that right there's absolutely no virtue in a trash can none especially that one come out of my office but it's just a stinking trash can no virtue in it when we were overseas the people would take our water and the woman and i they may be listening today that most of them don't understand english but but the water they take a bottle of water i had a bottle of water about half full and a woman come up to me she goes like this and i said this and that i thought well maybe she she needs some water you know to drink and she grabs it runs off i never see her again he took my water and i found out they believed in holy water they come from a catholic background i wouldn't pray over the water that's a bridge too far but brother simeon was there with us brother simeon may be watching today from from ivory or coaster where's he from freetown uh one of those countries in west africa he's from freetown look up freetown and uh he's where brother simeon was i know it's getting late where brother simeon was he or when they caught those teammates he was just too kind to let him go and see he blessed the water you know i believe people got healed doing that just because they believed it you don't need water today nothing in this that you need maybe some things that i need nothing because i've been preaching too long but nothing else that you need but brother branham let john ryan i never caught this before he said let me feel you yeah john ryan come on the prayer line he said let me feel you he needed to be able to actually feel brother brandon know he was there yeah because that was the sense that he had and then he could believe oh god sometimes that's what a prayer line does he said let me feel you he said what is your name i said brandon he said let me feel you and i let him put my hands over he said mr branham as a catholic i'm taught to believe my priest he said i've come to you for help you told me who i was all about my conditions what nobody knows but god i believe it to be the truth i'll keep on saying praise god off the platform he went he said well i couldn't hardly have the service the next two nights he'd get up there where i was at praise the lord for healing me and i'd start preaching he'd raise up over hollering praise the lord for healing me give him a job selling papers nearly a month was gone hollering praise the lord for healing me he was down there he hollered extra praise the lord for healing me they laughed and made fun of him little knew the boys hissed at him people on the street said that old man has lost his mind he'd say extra extra read all about it praise the lord for healing me they took him and they thought he was going to have to send him to the insane institution they questioned him he said i'm just as normal in my mind as i ever was but i believe god how many believes god this morning praise the lord for healing me on like that what was it he was holding on to that sixth sense amen something had showed him where he was gonna land and when you can see where you're gonna land you can jump yes sir hallelujah amen he said that sight had nothing to do with it he was seeing with another side he's seen god amen he said we look at things we don't see all the christian armors by faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is all the fruits of the spirit everything is faith unseen we look at the unseen by faith we see it he said a little boy let him across the street to get a shave in a barber shop some little smart elk barber wanted to make some fun of him got to shave him and said you know he said say papa ryan he said yes son said i heard you go over to see the holy roller when he was up here he said yeah i did he said i heard you got healed he said yes i did praise the lord for healing me when he did that his eyes come open in the barber chair out of that chair he jumped with the towel around his neck the barber run of the door with the razor in his hand down the street went old man ryan just as hard as he could go screaming and shouting praise the lord he's healed me what was it holding on to that sixth sense he said that's something that makes it real oh do you believe in something that makes it real this morning amen i'm going to skip past these next scriptures thank you for pulling on me this morning it helps but it keeps me away from my notes so through the sixth sense to seek and knock down paul remember hebrews told about the heroes of faith in the old testament but the branham in the sixth sense goes down to the new testament he said the sixth sense the sea could not drown paul because he saw a vision of the angel of the lord amen he said the storm was just as great as it ever was but that sixth sense went to work when he'd seen the angel of the lord that sixth sense could not keep peter in jail he said the sixth sense they could not keep paul and silas in stocks god sent an earthquake he shook the whole thing down he said that sixth sense let it go to work for you sometime because of that sixth sense the lions couldn't even eat daniel they couldn't fool with that sixth sense by that same sixth sense here's where i'm coming to this morning that was working in little martha when she come to see jesus raised her brother out of the grave after being dead for four days don't you see that same sixth sense is why how you get your rapture what was martha type for the bride we went through that how she stood there and said lord i believe amen i believe that that in the i believe and he said i am the resurrection of life if you'd have been here she said my brother wouldn't have died but i am the resurrection of the life listen he gave her a revelation of a resurrection hey man you're giving that to us today amen that same sixth sense raised up jesus christ on the third day that same six cents will rapture the church one of these days and take it out of here to glory he said don't rely on the five they're deceitful but that sixth one's right musicians go ahead and come i'm going to close you talked about charlie and nelly cox but some of many of you remember charlie and nelly cox i've been in their house and and talked to them they're still alive as far as i know it and brother charlie cox he talked about them he said he took six cents he was talking about sixth sense and charlie taped it if i understand correctly what brother bran was saying charlie made a tape of brother branham just talking about it and because he tells it in the message the sixth sense he tells he takes that tape just brother brandon talking about it he takes it home and plays it receives the holy ghost he said and and then nellie said well if he could do that for him he could do it for me and she goes into her room and plays shuts the door and plays that about six inches brother branham talking about it and god gave her the holy ghost yes amen brother brown said what is it if you believe it we should believe it without any seeing but yet god lets us see it anyhow oh god this is what i love he shows it to us he shows us his presence surely then there'd be no excuse that that sixth sense won't go to work we talked last week and i read you the quote where the man that believes in god can see the presence of god feel the presence of god since the presence of god and no he's here moses negotiated with god for his presence to be with him see we we shouldn't have to see him but he lets us see him he lets us feel him even in the five senses or when you do but you won't ever recognize it without a sixth sense it's awakened moses negotiated with it he lord told him he said well he said i'm going to send you up but my presence won't go with you he said if your presence doesn't go with me i don't want to go i said no if my presence is going out with me carry us on a pence and god said i'll send my presence with you he said i beseech thee moses went a little further i pray that we would go a little further this morning i want to know you lord it's not enough just to go to church and say i have faith i believe i want to know you i want revelation in my life i want to see your face i want to sense your glory wouldn't you like to be like that where you could sense the presence of god but the brown said a man that believes god can you can sense his presence you can know he's there oh god he said i love this he said show me your glory god said i'll make all my goodness pass before thee hallelujah he put moses in the cleft of the rock covered him up with his hand and his faith it only allowed him to see the back part of god because remember it was a theophany form of god he had to come in christ so we could see him face to face we've seen him now amen one day first john 1 1 john could stand there and say that which we heard was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen in other words it comes from faith come by hearing we heard about it but we saw it we've seen with our eyes we've looked upon our hands have handled it of the word of life now we've seen him listen church we see him today by faith don't we we don't see him in a corporal body but one day we'll be like john would say i saw him in the flesh but you can see his presence like moses today he's still here if you want to see him bad enough you can feel his presence you can know he's there would you bow your heads with me if we play something one day our faith will be a reality but it can be a reality to us now by faith faith is the substance the the reality the real thing of things hoped for the evidence the proof of things not seen do you want to see him today i know we need to see him i'm a little bit like moses you can go off if you want to without his presence say well the promise is good i believe in the promise what i want is presence too moses said if your presence doesn't go with me don't send me lord well that's the kind god gives the promises to is the ones who want him to along for the ride they want him to be with them is that your prayer you want him to be with you at school at work all through life lord be with me lord i believe your word i i believe i have faith today to believe it but let me let me just have a sense of your feeling of your presence lord i know that won't be wrong because it's written in your word that i can have it your prophet told me that if i believe you i could know that you're near lord and i want to recognize when you're near so i can take advantage of your presence i want to be able to entertain you lord so let me see you in whatever form you present yourself in let's make that our prayer this morning heavenly father lord we thank you so much lord for the feeling of your presence and the knowledge and the understanding that you're here but lord we want to know you more we want to know you by your word lord we know that that ought to be enough but we're human beings we live in five senses and satan constantly bombards us oh god he bombards us through these five senses and through the senses of our spirit he bombards us with reasoning and imagination and conscience lord telling us we're not good enough tell us we won't make it lord to this morning we want a sense of your presence or that we can know that you're the same yesterday today and forever we want to know lord we're we're simple creatures we're human beings or we have faith today but lord sometimes we have to reach out and feel you we want a god with skin on it oh god help us to recognize it or help us not to lord if it's if it's a person you sit by our way if it's a family member if it's a if it's a pastor if it's a deacon or somebody else in the church lord now you sit by our way may we recognize god in flesh lord be willing to say lord i believe it was you wasn't that person but i believe it was you that spoke to me today i believe that you came and raised my faith up to a level where i can believe all the blinders have been taken off my eyes i can see thank the lord for my healing i can see you in the power of your resurrection i pray you'd grant that today maybe there'd be somebody lord maybe their father blinded them or their their their family history lord was always one of unbelief lord and then they come into the message of the hour and that unbelief just lingers and it just lingers on and and on to the children oh god would you break that thing today lord may there be a reality of your presence so we can know you lord a god that we can know a god that's real lord as the song says i was there i felt it i don't know how you felt but i know how i felt when you come by my way oh god help us to recognize these things help us to keep a balance in these things lord not to go by feelings we don't contact our heavenly home by feelings if we have faith we can feel you lord and believe that you're here with us we thank you for it we believe lord you're doing a mighty work for each one of these people i pray to continue to do it or to the weak lord as we gather again tonight may there be that sweet sense of your presence like there was this morning oh lord we we need you so much we
