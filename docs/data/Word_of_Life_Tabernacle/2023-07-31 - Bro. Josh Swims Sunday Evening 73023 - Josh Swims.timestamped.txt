[41:08] this afternoon
[41:10] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse we're
[41:14] going to read in verse 11 but we're
[41:16] probably going to cover most of chapter
[41:17] two uh Lord permitting so we'll just see
[41:20] what kind of time we have and things
[41:22] like that
[41:24] uh we'll just go from here Ephesians
[41:26] chapter two and let's read verse 11.
[41:29] it says wherefore remember
[41:32] that you being in time past
[41:35] he says Gentiles in the flesh
[41:38] who are called uncircumcision by that
[41:41] which is called the circumcision In the
[41:43] Flesh he says made by hands
[41:46] that at that time he says you were
[41:48] without Christ
[41:50] it says being aliens from the
[41:53] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[41:56] from the covenants of promise
[41:59] he says having no hope
[42:01] and without God in the world
[42:04] but notice what verse 13 says he said
[42:06] but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[42:10] were afar off
[42:12] is that are made now by the blood of
[42:14] Christ
[42:15] just by our history word of prayer this
[42:17] afternoon Heavenly Father
[42:19] Lord we just thank you for allowing us
[42:21] to be able to assemble ourselves
[42:23] together with Saints of light precious
[42:25] Faith this afternoon but we just pray
[42:27] that you would just calm our nerves now
[42:29] Lord and just Lord help us as minister
[42:32] of the Gospel to help me to get myself
[42:34] out of the way this afternoon Lord and
[42:36] that that it would be you speaking to
[42:38] your people Lord and Lord as the the
[42:40] hearers that would hear this word here
[42:43] here in the building or wherever it may
[42:46] go Lord I pray that Lord that they could
[42:48] get theirselves out of the way Lord Lord
[42:50] that they could receive exactly whatever
[42:51] it is that they have need of there may
[42:54] be one here that has need of healing
[42:56] tonight maybe one that has need of
[42:57] Salvation or Deliverance of of some
[43:00] Demon or something Lord we know that
[43:02] you're more than able to take care of
[43:03] every situation in every condition here
[43:05] tonight Lord we just pray that Lord that
[43:07] you just help us to completely yield
[43:09] ourselves into the Holy Spirit now just
[43:12] have your way in everything that's said
[43:13] and done we ask in the name of the Lord
[43:14] Jesus Christ
[43:16] amen God bless you you can have your
[43:17] seats this evening
[43:19] as I said it's uh just good to be here
[43:21] this evening and been uh I guess it's
[43:23] been a couple years since we've been
[43:24] over and just brother Ben's asked me a
[43:27] couple of times and we just we could
[43:28] never get together so anyway we finally
[43:31] made it happen so we're just we're glad
[43:33] to be here so like I said if if possible
[43:36] this evening maybe we can look at uh
[43:38] here in the book of Ephesians and and uh
[43:40] we know that the teachings that brother
[43:42] Branham or the prophet of God we know
[43:45] that the teachings of brother Brown we
[43:48] can find in the message that the book of
[43:49] Ephesians it positionally places the
[43:53] believer amen is that right we we know
[43:56] how that brother Branham he tied that
[43:58] the book of Ephesians in with Joshua and
[44:01] how they positionally places the
[44:03] believer in Christ Jesus and how that
[44:06] you know that how that God whatever in
[44:08] the in the Book of Joshua it's just like
[44:10] it is with you and me this evening
[44:11] church in the Book of Joshua hear God he
[44:15] come down and he was speaking with
[44:17] Joshua and after
[44:20] he left the scene
[44:22] and hear God's speaking with Joshua and
[44:24] he says as I was with Joshua so will I
[44:27] also be with you yeah and here Joshua he
[44:30] was one that could we say that he
[44:31] carried the briefcase for Moses he was
[44:34] one that seen all of Moses's faults all
[44:36] of his failures he's seen that his
[44:39] temper and The Temptations and the
[44:40] strife and the things that he had to go
[44:42] through we have that same promise here
[44:44] tonight church that as I was can we say
[44:48] with brother Branham or with it with
[44:50] these ministers a past past days I'll be
[44:53] with you the the message didn't pass off
[44:57] the scene when when brother Branham
[44:58] passed off the scene we still have the
[45:01] we still have the same promises this
[45:03] evening that that they had in times past
[45:06] right so as I was with Joshua as I was
[45:09] with Moses or as I was with Moses as I
[45:12] was with these I'll be with you here
[45:14] this evening amen so we have that that
[45:17] positionally that positioning message
[45:19] this evening that Jose's positionally
[45:22] places us in Christ Jesus amen
[45:26] listen let's look at uh Ephesians
[45:28] chapter one
[45:30] and we're as I said we'll we're going to
[45:32] get over in Ephesians chapter two but I
[45:34] just got a few scriptures here that I'd
[45:35] like to read and and
[45:37] I probably may be a little different
[45:39] than some of your message preachers but
[45:42] I like to read a lot of scripture and uh
[45:44] it but that's where our message comes
[45:46] from it's brother Branham he never
[45:48] pointed himself or never pointed the
[45:50] message to himself but he showed us in
[45:53] the where it come from in the scriptures
[45:54] amen so here in Ephesians chapter 1
[45:58] in verse 13 it says in whom you also
[46:01] trusted
[46:03] after that you heard the word of Truth
[46:06] The Gospel of your salvation says in
[46:10] whom also after that you believed he
[46:12] says you were sealed with the Holy
[46:15] Spirit of promise he says which is the
[46:17] earnest church he said it's the earnest
[46:20] of our inheritance unto the Redemption
[46:22] of the purchased possession unto the
[46:25] praise of his glory
[46:26] listen we're still for the Holy Ghost
[46:29] this evening we're still with the Holy
[46:31] Spirit of promise and we know that word
[46:33] sealed we know from what brother Brown
[46:36] said in the message he said it signified
[46:38] a finished work is that right it
[46:41] signifies that you're a finished work
[46:43] this evening you've been positionally
[46:46] placed in Christ Jesus you're a finished
[46:48] work yeah we're we're knowing that we're
[46:51] able to rest upon the things of God Amen
[46:53] we don't have to worry about what
[46:55] Biden's doing we don't have to worry
[46:57] about the Democrats we don't have to
[46:59] worry about all the strife and the
[47:00] things that are going on all the war all
[47:03] the wars that's taking place and things
[47:05] like that we're able to rest in that
[47:07] church well the world's worried about
[47:09] their 401ks and how they're they're not
[47:12] going to be able to retire and all this
[47:13] God's got it under control we have that
[47:16] we have that promise in the Bible that
[47:18] we're able to claim that amen we're able

[48:00] it right it rests right in here and
[48:02] we're going to get into this a little
[48:04] further here just shortly you'll see
[48:06] where I'm going here just shortly Acts
[48:08] chapter 2 and verse 38 says then Peter
[48:11] said unto them

[49:11] know Amen to know that that you have
[49:13] healing this afternoon who has need of
[49:15] healing this afternoon
[49:17] some there's some of you that have need
[49:19] of healing this afternoon Amen to know
[49:21] that you can overcome the devil this
[49:23] afternoon Amen to know that you that
[49:26] you're going to make a Rapture amen
[49:29] there's no question about it
[49:31] right we're able to read God's word and
[49:34] see that
[49:35] you have it you don't have to question
[49:38] it anymore just you just you just take
[49:40] it and you rest upon it amen rest upon
[49:43] the fact that you have it
[49:45] claim that tonight
[49:47] amen
[49:49] see you've been placed in Christ Jesus
[49:51] this afternoon
[49:52] there's no one that can take that away
[49:54] from you
[49:55] you believe that this afternoon amen
[49:59] see that was the whole purpose in the
[50:01] fall of the Garden of Eden
[50:03] we want to question God and why would
[50:06] you why would you create Adam and Eve
[50:08] and why would you create and allow them
[50:10] to fall and all these things but God
[50:12] knew
[50:13] that they would fall
[50:14] God made them in a way that he gave them
[50:18] the ability to make their own decisions
[50:20] and so he allowed them to fall but in
[50:23] doing that he was able to to fulfill his
[50:26] whole purpose of him coming down himself
[50:28] to in the form of a man amen if there
[50:31] are certain attributes about God that he
[50:33] wanted to be healer that he wanted to be
[50:34] a savior that he wanted to be a redeemer
[50:37] amen there was reasons why certain
[50:40] things happen in our lives there's
[50:42] reason why certain things happen in the
[50:44] Old Testament we can look at it and say
[50:46] God why did you allow those things to
[50:47] happen see there's a purpose and there's
[50:49] a reason behind it Church
[50:51] amen
[50:54] see there's a purpose in him coming down
[50:57] and being a sacrificial lamb to the
[50:59] slaughter
[51:01] do you you know it brings into
[51:03] remembrance of the story in the Book of
[51:06] Ruth and I don't have time to get in
[51:07] that tonight but talking about a kinsman
[51:09] redeemer
[51:11] to know that we have a Kinsmen Redeemer
[51:13] Church this afternoon to know that they
[51:15] were able that he's positionally placed
[51:18] us in Christ Jesus
[51:20] and to know that he as a Kinsmen
[51:22] Redeemer he come down
[51:24] and he felt your sickness yeah
[51:27] he felt all your pain
[51:29] he felt your temptations that you go
[51:32] through he felt the trials and the
[51:34] situations and all the things that you
[51:36] have to endure right there's a reason
[51:38] behind it all
[51:40] yeah see he's shedding his own blood
[51:41] that you and I could live this afternoon
[51:44] Church
[51:45] are we Worthy
[51:49] we're not we're not worthy on our own
[51:51] are we
[51:53] but he came down in the form of a serve
[51:56] and he yielded himself
[52:00] so that we could be worthy
[52:03] amen
[52:05] see we there's nothing that we can do
[52:07] ourselves this evening
[52:09] but we have to yield ourselves to him
[52:12] and to his purpose
[52:14] if you yield yourself into him into his
[52:17] purpose this afternoon you'll be made
[52:19] worthy amen allow that blood that was
[52:22] shed to come upon you
[52:24] listen that's the only thing that will
[52:27] save you this afternoon
[52:30] I know I know I'm talking to Believers
[52:32] here this evening
[52:34] but it's that shed blood
[52:36] they said shed blood the life that was
[52:39] in that blood amen we we know that we we
[52:43] know what brother Branham said if we had
[52:44] a vial of that blood it wouldn't do us
[52:46] any good but if we allow that life the
[52:48] spirit of the life that was in that
[52:50] blood to come within you and me amen
[52:52] that same Spirit if it resides within
[52:54] you and me that'll be what saves you
[52:57] this afternoon that's what's going to
[52:58] allow you to make a Rapture this
[52:59] afternoon that's what's going to allow
[53:01] you to be an overcomer yeah amen
[53:04] see we must identify with our sacrifice
[53:07] Church we've got to identify with our
[53:10] sacrifice just as Abel was able to come
[53:13] down we can go back and you can read it
[53:15] in the in the beginning of the book in
[53:17] The Book of Genesis he pulled that lamb
[53:20] down to the altar church he he pulled
[53:24] that lamb down to the altar a lamb that
[53:26] was willing to give its life he he
[53:29] laid the lamb upon the Altar and he took
[53:32] a rock and he started to beat that lamb
[53:35] he didn't do like Cain did yeah
[53:38] yeah Cain he he didn't want to he didn't
[53:40] want to get messy yeah
[53:43] Kane did he didn't want to he didn't
[53:45] want to get the blood all over
[53:47] could you imagine how can you imagine
[53:49] the scene as it's transpiring over how
[53:52] that came maybe Kane's looking back at
[53:54] him and said Abel what are you doing
[53:56] why are you doing that
[53:58] see it comes a point that you have to
[54:00] identify with yourself with a sacrifice
[54:02] amen Abel as he as he's laying that the
[54:06] lamb down there and the blood's going
[54:08] all over the place yeah
[54:09] he's identifying with that sacrifice
[54:12] he's allowing the blood to go all over
[54:14] him
[54:14] the blood's going all over the altar he
[54:17] he's feeling the heartbeat of that lamb
[54:19] is starting to leave him yes sir he's
[54:21] identifying himself with a sacrifice
[54:24] church that's what you and each and
[54:25] every one of us have to do this
[54:27] afternoon is we have to identify
[54:29] ourselves
[54:30] with a sacrifice
[54:32] that's the only way that we can be
[54:34] identified with Christ
[54:35] is we have to identify with him we have
[54:38] to allow that blood that the life that
[54:40] was in that blood to come upon you and
[54:42] me amen that shed blood this evening
[54:46] he identified with sacrifice
[54:49] Abel
[54:51] he wasn't ashamed
[54:53] he didn't regret it Church
[54:57] he was willing to give his life
[55:00] amen yes
[55:02] yes new this evening let me ask you a
[55:05] question
[55:07] are you willing to give your life
[55:12] some of you know exactly what I'm
[55:14] talking about
[55:15] see you see a couple silver-haired ones
[55:18] here or that know exactly what I'm
[55:20] talking about they no doubt giving their
[55:22] lives for the for the things of the
[55:24] Gospel
[55:25] maybe their whole life they've had to
[55:27] surrender over and maybe had to do it
[55:30] out from time to time
[55:32] because
[55:33] that's right certain things had
[55:34] transpired in their life because if
[55:36] you're going to be a Christian you have
[55:38] to give up some things
[55:39] you have to but you have to identify
[55:42] with that sacrifice maybe that's not
[55:44] having a fanciest house maybe it's not
[55:46] having the best of cars maybe it's not
[55:48] having all the worldly Goods that all
[55:50] the world possesses but you've
[55:52] identified with a sacrifice amen you've
[55:55] allowed that you've allowed that blood
[55:57] that the spirit is in that blood to come
[55:59] upon you and then you've been
[56:00] positionally placed in Christ Jesus as a
[56:03] son or a daughter of God Amen
[56:06] we got to be like Abel tonight willing
[56:09] to surrender all in you unto God you got
[56:13] to come to a point where you won't
[56:14] hesitate you won't stumble to lay down
[56:16] your life
[56:17] young people you got to come to a point
[56:19] that that this is a realization for you
[56:22] that that I know that I know that I know
[56:24] that I've been filled with the Holy
[56:25] Ghost that I've been born again amen
[56:33] second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[56:35] 20 it says
[56:37] now then we are our ambassadors for
[56:40] Christ
[56:42] as though God did beseech You by us
[56:46] it says we pray you in Christ instead it
[56:49] says be ye reconciled to God for he hath
[56:53] made him to be sin for us
[56:56] who knew no sin
[56:58] see talking about identifying yourself
[57:00] with that sacrifice somebody that was
[57:02] able to lay down his life somebody that
[57:04] didn't know sin he didn't he didn't do
[57:07] anything wrong
[57:08] but he was able to lay down his life
[57:10] someone who knew no sin that that we
[57:13] might be made the righteousness of God
[57:15] in him are you willing to completely
[57:18] surrender everything over
[57:20] for him amen
[57:23] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 it says
[57:28] finally my brother
[57:31] he says be strong in the Lord and in the
[57:33] power of his mind
[57:35] says put on the whole armor of God that
[57:37] you may be able to stand against The
[57:39] Wiles of the devil
[57:41] says for we wrestle not against flesh
[57:43] and blood but against principalities he
[57:45] says against Powers against the rulers
[57:48] of the darkness of this world against
[57:50] spiritual wickedness in high places
[57:52] he says wherefore take unto you the
[57:55] whole armor of God is that you may be
[57:58] able to withstand the evil day and
[58:01] having done all to stand to stand
[58:03] therefore having your loins gird about
[58:05] with truth I believe we have some truth
[58:07] this afternoon amen and having on the
[58:10] breastplate of righteousness he says in
[58:12] your feet shod with the preparation of
[58:14] the gospel of peace he said above all

[58:19] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[58:21] darts of the wicked it says and take the
[58:23] helmet of salvation and the in the sword

[59:30] Brother Branham but that's not just
[59:31] preachers in the in the Pulpit but he's
[59:33] talking about the bride of Christ amen
[59:36] he says God has to honor the word for he
[59:39] has so solemnly written that whatsoever
[59:42] you bind on Earth that will I bind in
[59:45] heaven whatever you loose on Earth that
[59:47] will lie loose in heaven and give unto
[59:49] thee the he's of the Kingdom listen
[59:52] Church
[59:53] such great promises he's given the
[59:55] church
[59:56] such great precious promises if you've
[59:58] been made ambassadors for for Christ
[1:00:01] this evening he says take the word of
[1:00:02] God say take the sword of God start
[1:00:04] defeating those enemies start fighting
[1:00:06] the enemies Church destroy your enemy
[1:00:09] you don't have to be bound to sickness
[1:00:10] and pain and death and all these other
[1:00:12] things and Man start to fighting those
[1:00:14] Devils start fighting those Temptations
[1:00:16] all the struggles that you grow through
[1:00:18] don't give in to him don't give him any
[1:00:20] ground amen why are you letting why are
[1:00:24] you allowing Satan to come upon your
[1:00:25] ground in squatter yeah
[1:00:27] why are you letting him take possessions
[1:00:29] it's not him be Overcomers this
[1:00:32] afternoon amen you've been positionally
[1:00:35] placed in Christ Jesus to be able to
[1:00:37] take the word of God and believe it and
[1:00:39] to be able to apply it to your lives
[1:00:41] to be Overcomers amen
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:49] all right so let's look at Ephesians
[1:00:51] chapter two I've said all that that's a
[1:00:53] foundation of what I'm going to say
[1:00:54] tonight
[1:00:57] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1. well
[1:01:01] we'll just we'll go as far with this I
[1:01:03] I'm not a long-winded preacher so we'll
[1:01:05] uh I'm I'm almost we're according to
[1:01:07] clock I'm half almost half done so
[1:01:11] we'll just take as far as we can and
[1:01:13] maybe some other time we can finish it
[1:01:15] up so Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 it
[1:01:18] says
[1:01:19] and you hath he quickened and
[1:01:22] I love the book of Ephesians it just it
[1:01:25] does something for me when I start
[1:01:27] reading the book of Ephesians you know
[1:01:29] what here Paul he's speaking he says and
[1:01:31] you half he quickened who were dead in
[1:01:34] trespassings and sins you you realize I
[1:01:37] I know we realize we know what that word
[1:01:40] Quicken means tonight but that word
[1:01:42] quickens maybe for our younger ones
[1:01:45] sometimes we we expect everybody to know
[1:01:47] exactly what we're talking about but
[1:01:49] maybe our younger ones here don't know
[1:01:51] that word Quicken means to be made Alive
[1:01:53] Church and man it means to be made alive
[1:01:56] there was a change from Death unto life
[1:01:58] hey man you were once dead but now
[1:02:01] you've been made alive amen see there's
[1:02:04] no other thing that that could happen to
[1:02:06] any person so great
[1:02:08] as a changing from Death To Life
[1:02:11] amen
[1:02:13] amen a man get this a man if he was
[1:02:16] dying physically
[1:02:18] it could be healed physically
[1:02:20] that would be a great thing wouldn't it
[1:02:22] if you were dying of cancer and and they
[1:02:25] were able to give you treatments and
[1:02:26] chemo and everything else and but but
[1:02:29] whatever man could do and they killed
[1:02:31] all the cancer out that would be a
[1:02:33] wonderful thing to be able to save your
[1:02:34] life right but there's nothing so great
[1:02:37] is when he is spiritually dead
[1:02:40] and God has quickened him to life that
[1:02:44] that's something we were all at one time
[1:02:46] church we were all this way amen so he's
[1:02:49] taking that form of God upon himself
[1:02:51] taking that form of God upon the
[1:02:53] believer right
[1:02:54] see in placing eternal life there
[1:02:58] as I was saying earlier is Christ the
[1:03:01] Redeemer Christ the the Creator within
[1:03:03] you amen
[1:03:05] and if you've got eternal life this
[1:03:07] evening church then you always were
[1:03:10] do you realize that
[1:03:12] see it's not some pep talk that we're
[1:03:14] trying to pep you up and things like
[1:03:15] that but do you understand it in our in
[1:03:17] our in our human intellect in our human
[1:03:19] understanding it's hard for us to
[1:03:20] understand God it's hard to understand
[1:03:23] that
[1:03:24] yeah I was talking some of our our even
[1:03:26] my own kids sometimes we have these
[1:03:28] conversations and it's hard for us to
[1:03:31] understand that God always was
[1:03:34] when Earth wasn't here when stars wasn't
[1:03:37] you know there wasn't nothing around
[1:03:40] God was still there
[1:03:42] and it's hard for us in our human
[1:03:44] understanding to understand that I asked
[1:03:47] that we had a youth meeting here last
[1:03:48] weekend over at the park and I asked the
[1:03:52] I just asked the kids some questions and
[1:03:54] I asked them I said if you could speak
[1:03:55] to God face to face
[1:03:58] what's one thing that you would ask him
[1:04:00] and some of them asked that question
[1:04:02] what you know
[1:04:05] how was it how is it that this would be
[1:04:09] and you know there's things that we
[1:04:11] can't explain there's things that's what
[1:04:12] that's when faith comes in that thing we
[1:04:14] just have to believe it by faith we have
[1:04:16] to have amen and one day we'll
[1:04:18] understand it I believe when we get over
[1:04:20] there we're able to talk to God we're
[1:04:22] able to to listen to him can you imagine
[1:04:25] the conversation brother being as we're
[1:04:27] sitting there and God he we we have a
[1:04:29] question and he sets us down and
[1:04:31] he just starts explaining it's like
[1:04:33] sitting at a table with an elderly
[1:04:36] brother an old oak tree he starts
[1:04:38] telling you all the things that you he I
[1:04:41] sit down with brother uh
[1:04:43] I have some some elderly brother one
[1:04:46] some time ago and he's telling me all
[1:04:48] the things that he did back in the 60s
[1:04:50] and 70s and he starts telling me how did
[1:04:52] he come into the message he starts
[1:04:54] starts telling me all the things that he
[1:04:56] used to be a hippie and all these other
[1:04:57] things and how you come in and just
[1:04:59] sitting there and just baffling me you
[1:05:01] know just I didn't I didn't ask any
[1:05:03] questions I was just sitting there
[1:05:04] listening to him talk I believe it would
[1:05:06] be like that one of these days when
[1:05:07] we're sitting around listening to God
[1:05:09] maybe it won't be that way maybe that's
[1:05:11] just my own you know you know maybe
[1:05:13] we're already already know everything
[1:05:15] but what maybe just sitting there we're
[1:05:17] just listening to God talk and we're
[1:05:19] just think you know God just yeah you
[1:05:21] don't even have to ask he just starts
[1:05:22] talking to you yeah you just start just
[1:05:25] more than what you can understand
[1:05:26] sometimes you know and just we know
[1:05:29] God's good to us Church you know it's
[1:05:32] hard for us to understand these things
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] see
[1:05:36] it's the believer taking on the form of
[1:05:38] God and God placing eternal life there
[1:05:42] if you've got eternal life as I said you
[1:05:44] always were
[1:05:46] you always work
[1:05:48] do you understand that this evening
[1:05:51] you always were because there is only
[1:05:54] one form of eternal life that's what
[1:05:55] brother Branham said we always were
[1:05:58] and the reason we were is because we are
[1:06:01] a part of God
[1:06:03] we're positionally placed in Christ
[1:06:04] Jesus we were a part of God
[1:06:07] and God is the only thing that that's
[1:06:10] eternal there is no eternal hell there
[1:06:12] is no none of these other things are
[1:06:14] Eternal at some point they all come to
[1:06:16] an end
[1:06:17] amen even the devil was a created being
[1:06:20] he's not he's not eternal
[1:06:24] right see you come to a place where you
[1:06:26] have to die out to yourself
[1:06:29] you have to die out to your sins
[1:06:32] you have to die out to your trespasses
[1:06:35] you have to die out to your old nature
[1:06:38] and if we have time and I I see that
[1:06:40] we're not going to have time but we're
[1:06:41] going to we'll get into some of this
[1:06:43] stuff you go back home and you read the
[1:06:44] book of Ephesians tonight and there's a
[1:06:46] lot of things that maybe I don't refer
[1:06:49] to in scripture but you'll find it right
[1:06:50] there in the book of Ephesians
[1:06:52] he says if you take off the old man and
[1:06:54] you put on the new and there's a whole
[1:06:56] lot of things you got to come to the
[1:06:58] point where you die out to all the old
[1:07:00] things and all get rid of all those
[1:07:02] things you take on eternal life this
[1:07:04] afternoon you put on the new man
[1:07:06] so you come to the place that you die
[1:07:07] out
[1:07:10] here
[1:07:13] brother Branham he says when a seed is
[1:07:15] placed into the ground
[1:07:17] is it in order for that life that is in
[1:07:19] it it has to in order for that life
[1:07:21] that's in it to live it has to rot
[1:07:24] if it doesn't rot he said cannot live
[1:07:28] he says in rot is to be completely done
[1:07:31] away with
[1:07:33] it's finished
[1:07:34] is it and when we get to the place that
[1:07:37] our own ideas is in our own thinking is
[1:07:41] completely gone and it's rotted away
[1:07:43] from us then the germ of Life can begin
[1:07:46] to live amen listen I'm not asking for a
[1:07:49] show of hands this evening but let me
[1:07:51] ask you something I asked the church

[1:08:51] something you get to read and then the
[1:08:53] promises of God you find that you're
[1:08:55] heir to these things amen I'm just an
[1:08:58] air of it I don't have anything to do
[1:09:00] with it

[1:11:31] don't know you and you don't know me
[1:11:34] that I know of maybe from Facebook or
[1:11:36] something like that but you know I can
[1:11:38] look out and I can see that there's
[1:11:40] things that you know
[1:11:43] some of you no doubt have struggled over
[1:11:45] time yeah
[1:11:49] yeah there was a time that you didn't
[1:11:50] serve God
[1:11:52] there was all a time that we didn't
[1:11:53] serve God right
[1:11:56] I know there was a time when I didn't
[1:11:58] serve God or even I didn't even want the
[1:12:00] things of God
[1:12:02] and I was raised in a message Church
[1:12:04] for the for the most part of my life I
[1:12:06] was raised in a message Church sit on
[1:12:08] message pew
[1:12:09] and I didn't want the things of God
[1:12:12] I was there because mom and daddy made
[1:12:13] me come
[1:12:15] maybe the same effect for some of you
[1:12:17] young ones that sitting here tonight
[1:12:20] but at some point God got a hold of my
[1:12:22] life
[1:12:23] I can remember very vividly remember I
[1:12:26] didn't hear an audible voice but I can
[1:12:28] very vividly remember the Lord coming
[1:12:30] and dealing with me when I was 13.
[1:12:32] and I pushed him away I said no I'll do
[1:12:34] it later I wasn't ready yeah yeah I can
[1:12:37] remember when he come to me again at 16.
[1:12:39] yeah
[1:12:40] but at 16 I had my driver's license I
[1:12:42] had girls that I wanted to chase I had
[1:12:43] things I wanted to do
[1:12:45] I pushed him away again
[1:12:48] but there come a time
[1:12:49] whenever the Lord started dealing with
[1:12:51] my heart with my life there come a time
[1:12:54] whenever I was 18 years old Lord he
[1:12:57] heavily come upon me
[1:12:59] and I had to surrender
[1:13:01] there has to come a time that we all
[1:13:03] have to surrender this evening church
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:08] there was a time that we didn't walk and
[1:13:10] talk about the things of God there was a
[1:13:13] time that I didn't want to do those
[1:13:14] things I was dead to God
[1:13:16] I was an enemy
[1:13:18] but thanks be to God who is rich in
[1:13:20] Mercy Church
[1:13:22] we'll get to that here in just a minute
[1:13:23] verse 3 says among whom also we all had
[1:13:27] our conversation he says in times past
[1:13:29] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:13:32] desires of the Flesh and of the mind it
[1:13:35] says and were by Nature
[1:13:37] notice what he says we're by Nature this
[1:13:39] is exactly what I was just talking about
[1:13:40] he says we're by Nature the children of
[1:13:43] Wrath even as others listen church I
[1:13:46] remember a time when I love country
[1:13:48] music I told the churches here not long
[1:13:50] ago I had a country a stack of country
[1:13:53] music CDs This Tall
[1:13:55] yeah
[1:13:56] I love that country music that's all my
[1:13:59] daddy he said if you don't listen to
[1:14:00] country music I mean it might have been
[1:14:02] a good thing in in the sense that he
[1:14:04] didn't let us listen to rock and roll
[1:14:06] and all those other things because it
[1:14:08] could have been so much worse than what
[1:14:09] what we was listening to
[1:14:11] but you know there's still times that if
[1:14:14] I'm not careful we walk in Walmart and
[1:14:16] they got some Hank Williams Jr or
[1:14:18] something like that on
[1:14:19] if you're not careful that that old man
[1:14:21] starts trying to come back out again you
[1:14:24] know there was a time that I used to
[1:14:25] listen to country music and loved it
[1:14:28] you know there was a time that that I
[1:14:30] was fulfilling the desires and the lust
[1:14:32] of the flesh just like you and I were
[1:14:34] amen right I wanted to go to all the
[1:14:38] dances that the school had to offer I
[1:14:40] wanted to do everything that I wanted to
[1:14:41] be popular
[1:14:43] yeah I wanted there was a time that I
[1:14:44] was an alien from God I didn't I didn't
[1:14:47] I didn't have the things that he did
[1:14:49] just what he's talking about right here
[1:14:50] I was fulfilling the lust of our flesh
[1:14:53] the desires of the Flesh of the Mind
[1:14:56] that was by Nature
[1:14:59] child of the Wrath
[1:15:01] right
[1:15:03] thought I had to be cool
[1:15:05] serving the lust of the flesh
[1:15:09] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[1:15:13] but listen Church verse 4.
[1:15:16] he says but God
[1:15:19] he says but God Church who is rich in
[1:15:22] Mercy

[1:22:54] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:22:57] should walk in them see that word
[1:22:59] created church it's Christ formed in the
[1:23:03] believer
[1:23:05] do you understand that I I was at and I
[1:23:08] told the church this several it's been
[1:23:09] maybe a year ago now and it just comes
[1:23:11] back to my mind that you know I raised a
[1:23:15] few farm animals I got some things out
[1:23:16] there and I usually go out there and
[1:23:17] feed them I got some Hogs and then and
[1:23:19] some uh goats and things like that and I
[1:23:21] go outside and I feed them early in the
[1:23:23] morning before I go to work
[1:23:24] and in the wintertime the yellow sun it
[1:23:27] didn't come up as quickly as it does in
[1:23:29] the summertime when I was out there and
[1:23:30] I was feeding these animals before I go
[1:23:32] to work and
[1:23:33] it was just a beautiful sky
[1:23:35] and I was thinking
[1:23:37] I was looking at this guy and I was
[1:23:39] thinking you know
[1:23:41] these are the same stars that Noah
[1:23:44] looked at
[1:23:46] these are the same stars that job looked
[1:23:48] at
[1:23:50] these are the same stars that whenever
[1:23:52] they were built to pyramids they were
[1:23:54] able to line up with the you all know
[1:23:57] about all those things how perfectly
[1:23:58] everything aligns up
[1:24:00] this is same stars that the prophets of
[1:24:02] old looked at
[1:24:06] cry you know I just started thinking
[1:24:07] about
[1:24:09] the creation of God
[1:24:11] and how it just started it just started
[1:24:13] ringing in so true to me
[1:24:16] and then when you start reading here in
[1:24:18] the book of Ephesians
[1:24:20] how they how the word how that God
[1:24:23] created
[1:24:25] Christ created he he Christ is formed in
[1:24:29] The Believer Christ the Creator God the
[1:24:33] Creator he's formed in The Believer
[1:24:35] Church
[1:24:37] what that ought to do you Christ the
[1:24:38] Redeemer Christ the Creator Christ the
[1:24:42] word formed in The Believer tonight
[1:24:45] man that ought to set you on fire yeah
[1:24:47] that ought to you to realize that you
[1:24:50] realize that you can speak worlds into
[1:24:51] existence tonight all right you just
[1:24:54] speak the word you know when Joshua he
[1:24:56] got in a little trouble he's seen that
[1:24:57] the the sun was starting to go down the
[1:24:59] moon's starting to come up
[1:25:00] you realize when you go back and you
[1:25:02] read the scripture
[1:25:03] Joshua didn't pray
[1:25:06] he spoke the word yeah says son stand
[1:25:09] still Moon stand still you as Believers
[1:25:12] in Christ Jesus those that have been
[1:25:15] positionally placed in crisis you're
[1:25:17] able to speak the word tonight
[1:25:19] for whatever it is that you have need of
[1:25:21] and you simply believe those words and
[1:25:24] maybe it takes
[1:25:25] maybe it'll happen instantly
[1:25:28] maybe it'll take a year maybe to take
[1:25:29] two years maybe
[1:25:31] but you keep believing it
[1:25:33] over and over and over you can hear on
[1:25:35] tape how brother Branham he would pray
[1:25:37] for different ones a blind man a
[1:25:38] different ones and maybe it didn't
[1:25:40] happen instantly but they came they kept
[1:25:42] professing what they were believing kept
[1:25:45] professing that kept confessing their
[1:25:47] healing kept professing that all
[1:25:49] everything that they believed in yeah

[1:29:44] and 11 it says
[1:29:45] wherefore remember he says that you
[1:29:48] being in time past
[1:29:50] this was our opening scripture I believe
[1:29:51] that you being in time past In the Flesh

[1:29:55] uncircumcision by that which is called
[1:29:57] the circumcision and the flesh made by
[1:30:00] hand it says that at that time he says
[1:30:03] you were without Christ
[1:30:04] being aliens from the Commonwealth of
[1:30:07] Israel and strangers from the covenants
[1:30:09] of promise it says having no hope we
[1:30:12] were all there church having no hope
[1:30:13] without God
[1:30:15] you realize you were aliens
[1:30:19] you were foreigners to the things of God

[1:30:24] rights Church

[1:55:51] to see him look upon his face there to
[1:55:56] sing forever of the Saving Grace and on
[1:56:01] the streets of Glory let me live my
[1:56:04] voice
[1:56:05] here's all past home at last ever to
[1:56:10] rejoice
[1:56:11] the winning battle is low I look toward
[1:56:14] the mountain high and behold my savior
