you we thank you just ask that you bless your word tonight to your people's hearts may they receive joy may they receive encouragement from it tonight i pray in jesus name we ask him amen amen we'll just speak tonight on on unity we'll start in psalms 133 verse 1. i just certainly appreciated the word of the lord this morning and man it kind of kind of cuts at you but that's what it's supposed to do amen we need that we need that correction i know if if nobody else needed that i needed that and certainly that is required amen verse 1 and behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments and as the dew of hermann as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore i mean you can be seated this afternoon we certainly just love the lord so we see that there is a a blessing amen when brethren can dwell in unity and david said how pleasant it is it is like the precious ointment upon the head all the way down to the garments of aaron the high priest and it is locking to the oil the holy spirit that anoints us as we come together as we come together to go in amen and partake of his blessing amen to be partakers of his blessings of his life amen and to be able to partake you must be anointed to be able to go behind the veil you can't just go in in any certain way amen you got to be dressed right you got to come according to the word you got to come and be anointed amen and not just anointed in but from the head to the feet from the top to the bottom to be able to go in into that presence into that shekinah where we're supposed to live where the blessing is amen into that hidden life that we heard about even this morning amen so you must be anointed to be able to partake of the blessing to partake of the life amen amen as the dews descended upon the mountains of zion there is a blessing even lie forevermore amen and there's a freshness from the anointing the anointing that's available to to you and i there's a freshness from that and there's a freshness from the dew that falls from heaven and then we look at the the oil that ran down aaron's beard from from the head amen through his beard even down to the very hymn of his skirt and brother branham says the anointing oil was made with the rose of sharon and the crushing of the rose brought forth to perfume and they put it on the oil that runs on aaron's beard plum to the hems of his skirt covered all over with the anointing oil amen so the oil was made with the rose of sharon you think about it there are many beautiful flowers like the rose i was talking to allison about this on the way there's many many beautiful flowers like the rose amen but when the rose is crushed and then it brings forth a sweet smelling savor there's something about the rose amen it's beautiful but yet when it's crushed it brings forth even more beauty and so they made the oil amen that anointed aaron with the crushing of that rose amen in this this this evening amen he is the rose of sam amen our lord jesus our great high priest amen aaron being the top amen of the great high priest that would go in that would take the blood before the father amen he was anointed and then he was anointed he was the rose of sharon and then he was anointed amen with the beauty of the lord was there but that beauty had to be crushed that beauty had to be crushed at calvary amen amen and when it was crushed brother burnham said it made that anointing for us and then so it had to be crushed for us to be able to partake of truly what it was it wasn't it wasn't just something beautiful amen but there was a there was a sweet smelling savor and then there was something there i mean there was an anointing even that that rose same in the rose of sharon our lord jesus was crushed at calvary eminent cross is our head amen and he was anointed and crushed at calvary and took his blood amen as the high priest before the father amen so that same anointing that was upon the head of aaron that ran down the same anointing that was on our lord jesus amen has come to the body amen it's the same anointing it's not something separate but it's the same anointing that went from the head all the way to the body amen that's that's what we partake of when we come together amen how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the precious ointment it's like the holy ghost amen that ran down aaron's beard amen do you love that tonight amen we can partake of that same life amen the same anointing that was upon the head it's on the body the same anointing and the same authority the same the same power of christ amen is here upon the body aiming to bring forth and when the blessings of the of the atonement and then we can partake tonight amen from that anointing then before you can go in you got to be anointed you got to be covered to partake of that blessing tonight and then i say his power is here tonight and when that authority is here tonight amen for the body amen for just let it run down amen amen the anointed word that we've received amen if we receive it for ourselves that same anointing is here tonight that we can partake of that and we can go into the blessing we can go into the shekinah we can live in that hidden place with christ amen so the oil amen it would preserve aaron as he would enter in with the sacrifice amen in the presence of god he like we said earlier he couldn't just go in any certain way but he had to be dressed right he had to be anointed and in that that anointing that oil preserved him as he went into the presence of god amen in that oil tonight amen has preserved the power of god through seven church ages amen the power of that atonement is still the same in the in the in the book of revelations and the third seal said hurt not the oil and wine amen it's a stimulation of revelation amen it's not a dead word it's not a dead gospel amen but god has preserved this anointing for you and i that we could partake amen that we can be stimulated amen by the word of the hour amen and not just live some old dead christian life amen but live under the anointing and be stimulated by the revelation god has preserved this amen that power and then he's preserved it amen for the true church amen for seven church ages god has preserved this and that is the only thing that will preserve you till his coming amen to be anointed with that same oil that same holy ghost you love the lord tonight amen he would enter in behind the curtain and shut off from the outside world alone there in the presence of god anointed amen anointed amen amen he was anointed to go into the holiest of holies into that shekinah him and to feed amen upon the original manna that fell amen not something that was kept over amen but there amen in the holiest of holies in the shekinah there was that man that kept over amen unto you and i mean it's a type that we can look at but to you and i it's the original holy ghost that failed on the day of pentecost amen we can partake we don't have to go off some other church age but god and this church age has sent an anointed word sending out pouring to you and i that we can partake of and we don't have to live off yesterday's but we can have a freshness today we can have our own amen our own portion of the original amen and then it was death to go in if you weren't if you weren't a high priest but now it's death to not go in you've got to go in amen you've got to go in yourself amen you can't just put it off on the preacher we can't put it off on the prophet you yourself amen have to go into that hidden place into that shekinah presence amen so it's the original man of the same the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost amen the same holy ghost that i received that changed my life and my my children can partake of that same holy ghost they can partake and then they can partake of the same holy ghost and they can change their life and man they don't have to live off my experience or grandma's experience or grandpa's experience but they can have their own amen because there is an original god has reserved this for his people amen but to partake we must be separated and then shut off from the world amen you've got to you've got to leave it all behind amen we've got to be even shut off from our own selves we must deny our own selves to be partakers you must shut yourself in amen and brother brahma says here and we just wanted to talk about unity but i thought those things were so good we want to think about unity and when brethren and brother brown says that when brethren can dwell together in unity it's locking under that oil we can enter into the presence of the lord with that anointing of brethren together in unity i mean we heard about that this morning we got to come to the house of god amen don't shut yourself off from the blessing amen we can come together as brethren amen come together as believers of like precious faith amen and it sets an atmosphere and then it sets an atmosphere it's like the precious anointment ointment amen that we can go together amen in union unity in the presence of god in unity is the blessing amen and there is an anointing of the holy spirit that comes with unity when brethren of light precious faith come together and the believers of his word and anointing for this hour amen matthew 18 and 19 and again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in the midst amen so we can come together and then we can come together amen in anything concerning anything amen that we ask then we can agree upon it it shall be done amen in the of the mind has the mind of christ and to know what he wants done with his word it means so we can come together and then we can come together concerning anything concerning any situation any need we can come together and ask and we shall receive amen and jesus said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst amen he's in the midst of his believers and he's in the midst of his of his of the call of the chosen amend is wisdom amen the god that is full of wisdom all wisdom the god that fills all time and space the god that is all powerful and in the god that is our mission i'm on the present omnipotent that's the god in our midst church and that's the god that if we can gather together i'm going to come in agreement not in strife amen not in bitterness amen not in confusion but if we can come together in agreement and knowing that god is god and that the anointing of the word is here if we can come together in agreement whatever we ask it shall be given do you believe that tonight that god is here to make good on his promise and i believe that i believe that as we come closer to the coming of the lord i believe that all the differences and funny feelings and the little isms amen that are that are around and that are between people i believe those things as the coming of the lord nears i believe those things will have to be no more i believe that they'll have to be done away with as we near him i do believe these things will be stripped away amen we will have difference of opinion and that's okay because that's just being human we all we all think a little different but we should have one purpose one motive and one desire and that is to see jesus christ glorified in our midst that ought to be our every purpose our every objective amen to see him glorified and then to see those that are bound set at liberty to see those that are bound set free that ought to be the purpose of the church and when to see that last one come in that ought to be our motive and our objective amen these little isms little funny feelings differences those things they must go away isaiah 52 and 6 therefore my people shall know my name and therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that does speak behold it is i how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that bring good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good and that publishes salvation that sayeth and design thy god reigneth thou watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion and then break forth into singing sing together ye waste places of jerusalem for the lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed jerusalem amen he said my people shall know who i am they shall know my name they shall know my power and i will be with him amen it's more than a prophet it's more than your favorite preacher amen but he is the one who has spoken to us in the day he should behold in his eye they shall know my name and i shall reveal myself to them amen behold it is i i am the one in the midst it's more than brother branham it's more than brother being it's more than brother tim pruitt it's more than brother donny reagan but he said behold it is i i am in your midst and they shall know my name they shall know who i am amen and he has brought joy into our hearts it meant joy unspeakable we were bound but we've been set free amen we've been delivered we've been redeemed amen and he has brought peace in our storms every step of the way god has made a way for you and i every step of the way he's been there and he's brought deliverance in my life he delivered me from habits and things that i could never break break free from that i could never deliver myself from but he came and he said behold they shall know my name behold it is i am and i will deliver her and i will bring redemption to the bride the watchmens the watchmen the ministers shall lift up the voice they don't all have to be saying the same thing amen they don't all have to be verbatim saying the same thing all the time amen but they shall lift up the voice amen with the voice together they shall sing for they shall see eye to eye and the lord shall bring again zion when he shall bring her forth amen by his word and then behold in his eye he is the one that will bring her forth you love that amen they come together they come together and been lifting up that same voice lifting up that voice the voice of the lord not not the voice of william branham but the voice of god the word to the bride amen and they shall sing together they shall lift that voice up together behold it is i him and he's the one he's the one that we lift up amen amen i believe that the spirit of truth is here amen to show us all things amen to bring things to our remembrance amen for the spirit of truth for it has come to tell us who we are where we came from and where we're going amen that's what the voice of the lord the spirit of truth amen to come and reveal to us what we have need of when we need it he don't just show us everything all at once but as we have need of it he shows us he brings these things to our remembrance as we have need of telling us who we are in the word amen telling us that what we were what we can be amen we love meetings and we love fellowshipping but we must come under this word i'm losing my voice we love those things we love to come together and fellowship with brethren amen but it's for a purpose and then to come under the word to come and lift up the voice amen that god has sent in this day not not not brother branham but the voice of god to lift up the word amen amen to call that this word could be lifted up that the word could be lifted up and draw the bride a power to call her up higher a true ministry of the word of the hours for the perfecting of the saints to edify and to build up not to constantly tear her down not to constantly tear down and beat her over the head but to edify and build up it will make us complete and bring a maturity and if there are things in our life that needs stripped or cut away or shaped the ministry is called to do that amen and god if i'm wrong or if i'm in heir god is obligated to show me that god is obligated to show us what is truth if we are his and we will accept his truth if the spirit of truth is in us and then the faith cometh by hearing excuse me faith cometh by hearing but if you don't ever hear the word you can't never come out of your ear you can't never be stripped you can't never be edified you can't never be perfected you can't come to the maturing amen but faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god amen i believe it's high time amen i believe it's it's way past time and then that we ought to put the word in the fourth front of every part of our lives and then we talk about it we talk about it and we've got it in every form that you can think of and then i believe we ought to be listening to the message of the hour and then we ought to be studying we ought to be praying and i'm preaching to myself here more than anybody and then we've got to we've got to guard those what did you talk about this morning we got to fortify those spots we got to fortify those weak spots amen and the only way we can do it the only way we can get closer to god amen is pray amen to get into the word amen come to church sit under the preaching of the word take the correction amen to say yes lord amen that's for me even though i fall short let me come up higher let me let me be different lord let me be what the word says i can be you love the lord so faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god but if you ain't ever in the presence of the voice how can you hear we're always listening to the wrong voices not always but jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mind be the truth amen that we have received the truth of the hour and then we ought to put it before our ears as much as we can amen amen for we will never reach the potentials of the bride without it amen we will all have to take our stand upon the truth and the word for this hour amen not just our ideas or what we think about the word amen amen but we will have to take a stand upon the truth amen for he is the word and he has come in this hour for for a bride to be clothed amen in the garment of his word if we are truly brethren and non-of different natures we will come together in christ and then we will come together on the basis of him and then to lift that same voice the basis of what his seventh church age messenger has told us the basis of his promise and the revelation for the hour and what the bride is called to be amen if we can't get together on that i i can't walk with you amen these are the things that we've got to get together on amen and how can two walk together unless they be agreed amen amen this this is the goal i mean this this is what this is what we've got to do we've got to come under the word amen to be what god has called us to be come on that basis on that fellowship amen not not who's the greatest not not who can have the best meeting i mean that's not that's not what we're here for remember we can fellowship around the word the revealed word of the hour and what god has called the bride to be amen brother burnham said elect won't persecute elect but the church natural has always persecuted the church spiritual and he says here in the church age books in the latest in church age he said now we can see there were two vines one true and one false and now we can see why abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted isaac and one after the promise and now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of god and the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit watch that nod of the same spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elect and god did not reprobate for the sake of reformation he reprobated for the sake of the elect elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect all those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the of the cane line the serpent seed they build their battles they build their cities they build their empires all the while calling on god they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the lord to destroy god's elect ones but they are needed what is the chapter the wheat no chaff and no wheat but at the end what happens to the chaff it is burned with an unquenchable fire and the wheat where is it it is gathered in this corner it is where he is one two and one false it knows that the flesh the natural will always persecute the spiritual they will try to destroy the elect amen one loving the things of god and the other one knowing much of the truth but not of the same spirit and there has always been that serpent seed line and it will be till the end they will try to destroy the elect they are kingdom builders they put themselves above god and the people of god somehow thinking they can escape judgment amen but every kingdom will be shook down every man-made kingdom that is built up will be shook down and the only thing that will be left standing is the cry as christ and his bride those that are built upon the foundation of the word those will be the only ones standing only christ and his bride will stand the true seed will always prevail but that that cane line has always been there from the beginning and it will be to the end so they hate the true seed and will do all they can to destroy that seed amen but when they try to destroy that seed it only causes it to be manifest and reveal christ in them and they can never truly destroy god's seed amen cain murdered abel because god rejected his offering and had respect unto cable cain brought forth in this wisdom he brought forth what he thought would be good enough for god what would be okay maybe this would just be all right amen he brought forth the works his works and the beauty thereof and satan has always dwelt in beauty amen but abel abel by revelation was able to see that it was more than fruit but it was a life that god required and many required blood from an innocent substitute that blood would appease god and the blood brought back that fellowship with god and then so cain murdered his half-brother amen a true brother won't murder another brother is that right cain and half brother they they were only half brothers we understand these things but a true brother will not murder another brother elect won't persecute elect elect cannot harm elect amen but the true brethren amen are in unity i mean we're on unity there's love amen among the elect you think about this seed and then that cane lineage that serpent seed has always tried to destroy the true seed and just a little story here from brother branham and i'll just kind of go through this but after calvary when jesus went to hell satan said i've got you he said i thought i had you when i killed abel i thought i had you when i killed daniel he said i surely thought i had you when i killed john the baptist and the others amen but i've got you now amen satan has always looked and tried to destroy that seed he said he told jesus now i've got you and here you are he said you're you're in my domain now this is my kingdom you're in my power and he told jesus that he died a sinner that's what satan will always try to do he'll make you try to make you doubt who you are he'll try to make you doubt what you've been through and what you've become and you've got you've become the word he'll always try to make you doubt that you're in god's will amen my brother said i can hear him say to satan i am the virgin born son of god amen my blood is still wet on the cross and then take note of that he began to tell him who he was and then he began to tell him who he was in the word what he had done what he had accomplished he began to he began to preach to satan of who he was and mary stripped satan of his power and there he defeated death hell in the grave and took the keys and he ascended and emptied out paradise of all those and then they were in paradise and then those that expressed the word for their day those are the true seed that had stood with god and there he set them free there he set them free amen satan has always tried to destroy that line i mean he will he will try to destroy you and hi he'll bring things he'll try to try to come at us amen and that same power the race him will quicken us amen they may try on this age to destroy the elect you know but she's been predestinated to victory and then she's been predestinated not to fall and then satan will try to destroy oh come right down to the end he'll try to destroy that line and remember the pride has been predestinated she's been predestinated to victory she's been predestinated to rise above this layout of cnh she's been producing a man back to the word and then back to the fullness of the word she won't be destroyed she will overcome i've always loved this quote brother branham said what and what was the holy ghost given for he said in the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans sanctified the wesleyans the that baptized the pentecostals is setting an order the coming of the lord and then when it will be so powerful that body will come into this group a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave amen just as jesus amen just as he descended and then he ascended and then he brought forth those of the past ages amen and when we when that power comes into this group amen not a group far off into the future but this group you and i when that when that fullness of that power comes in this group it'll draw the rest of them from the grave amen there will be a resurrection that's what the holy ghost was given for amen they without us cannot be made perfect even your brothers that have went on are depending on you and what about your brothers and sisters now we're we're we we need each other even those that have gone on are depending on us i'm i'm depending upon you and i you're depending upon me amen we must be united in him and he goes on to say oh elect of god beware study closely be careful work out your salvation with fear trembling rely upon god and be strong in his mind but your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watch unto prayer and be steadfast this is the end time both the true and false vines are coming to maturity but before the week matures those rap and terrors must be bound for the burning see they are all joining the world council of churches that is binding but soon the garnering of the wheat will come but right now the two spirits are are at work in the two vines come out from among the tares start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your lord and fit to reign and rule with him mr brother broom said what is the chaft to the wheat he said no chaff and no wheat and then the evil day in the spirit of the day is a testament of the true seed the elect being present and coming to maturity because of the evil amen it testifies it's a testament that we are here the evil of the day and how prevalent it becomes it's a testament of the true light of the true seed that is here now that is coming that is present that is coming to maturity but in the end the tears are bound together for the burning this is the binding all joining up and uniting together to make an image under the beast because that's the spirit of the day the uniting it's a uniting time brother and said that's the spirit of the day they're uniting together to make an image under that beast he said here in uniting time and time he said uniting together now trying to destroy the message how do they destroy it how could you they destroy the word of god they make it of none effect none affected by their traditions as they did back there they're in the beginning and making the word of god a known effect let me catch my breath here so we see that spirit uniting against the word uniting against what we believe to try to make it of none effect ever seeming so religious they'll take part of the word without the power without the effectiveness of it and thereby destroy and deceive amen but you and i have been called amen to take the word in its effectiveness and to project the word in its effectiveness amen that is power that it is spirit imagine that it is able to deliver those that are bound and under the disabled amen to rapture the church amen that's what i preached that's what brother ben preaches we've got what we need and then what god has given us it's able to rapture church it's able to change your body and then it's able to change amen from glory to glory it's able to make a sinner a saint it's able to make a sinner a son of god a daughter of god and we are living proof of that to a dying and dark world amen so they try to destroy it by making the word of no effect of the people by their traditions by what they think the message is by their own ideas and their own traditions instead of taking the full open revealed word amen they just take their little portion their little doctrine and they count down upon that amen and but by that which has no power and actually actually can change a life amen just preaching a doctrine it can't change anybody it ain't never changed nobody we need doctrine we need to hear these things and but this is simply having a teaching is something that you count down will never change nobody but they've got to have the gospel preached to them they've got to have the good news and then jesus christ is alive and well then he's the same yesterday today and forever i'll try to hurry up here amen but they're they're being united together amen for the burning amen and that uniting brother burns said we'll be be burned with an unquenchable fire and the wheat where is it what about the the wheat the true seed it is gathered together in his garner it is where he is gathered to him and then gather together amen they're uniting the religious world the church natural they're uniting to be burned but we are uniting together to go into his garner to go where he is and i'll just read this last little bit of this quote here i don't have much left anyways can i finish it i'll read this god is uniting his bride she is coming together from the east and the west and the north and the south sees you there is a united time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the rapture amen getting god's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the lord regardless of what the nomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride that's right and she's uniting herself with the bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom they're becoming so one the bride is becoming so one with the word that the very works of the bridegroom are manifest in the bride do you love the lord tonight we stand amen god is uniting this bride amen man may try to try to bring isms and differences amen but god is uniting the bride amen he's bringing it back together amen to go in the garner amen do you love the lord tonight amen brother ben thank you lord amen amen hallelujah do you believe that tonight amen we're coming together for a purpose amen i really appreciated that elect doesn't persecute elect elect doesn't persecute doesn't persecute anybody that we are the persecuted we get persecuted but we don't persecute we got to remember that amen amen i'm so grateful for that i'm thankful for these young men that have come and and are able to preach the word of god and to just stir our hearts amen amen let's bow our heads together for just a moment if we could play the old rugged cross heavenly father we we come to this special time lord of remembering you lord and we thank you that we're able to do it just being able to come as as brother stewart said in unity it's it's like the holy ghost it's like that precious rose of sharing that anointing that was crushed we're here today to remember how you got crushed oh but lord more than that to know that you didn't stay there they laid your body in a tomb and you lord look like all was lost but you went down into hell and as brother stewart was preaching how that you begin to tell the devil i'm the virgin born son of god my blood is still wet on calvary i'm so grateful lord that you were able to tell him that lord we couldn't speak for ourselves we were lord lost in sin a world without hope but lord you stood there and said i'm the virgin born son of god my blood is wet on calvary's cross i'm able to come take the keys of death and hell in the grave take them away from satan and come back on the third day we're so grateful for what you did lord so thankful lord as your body was broken so we wouldn't have to be may we not be a fractured body lord with each one having a different purpose and a different motive lord but as was so wonderfully said tonight with lord that all the ministers spoke and with one voice and they saw eye to eye lord may it be so lord every every one of us not just the ministry but each one there may be little things we disagree on we don't see the same on but lord when it comes to the realities of the word and the opening of the word lord in our midst we can all see eye to eye and say lord come quickly lord may it be so we remember what she did for us or if there would be anything in our hearts that would be wrong i pray you'd take it out cleanse us lord wash us from every sin [Music] oh god we don't deserve your love we don't deserve your mercy but you came anyway lord lord when we were unworthy you made us worthy we're so grateful it's because of that old rugged cross that you were able to do then we thank you for it we thank you lord we don't ever lose that in all of our lord our mysteries and things that we know and we we love those things lord we don't want to lose sight of what you did that day on calvary thank you for it i pray you'd wash every sin away i pray you to walk in every life may there just be a realness of your presence as we partake of these elements we pray in jesus name amen the brothers would prepare the communion and get ready to start bringing people up let's just sing that i on a hill i'm far away from rugged cross [Music] love that old cross oh we're the dearest and best for a world of lost are slain sing the chorus with me now before we read so i'll cherish still my trolls he said last i laid down oh [Music] oh and exchange it some [Music] amen let's read first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 for i've received of the lord which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood is you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come amen uh brother danny if you could direct us if you could just play something while they while they come [Music] glory forever i'll share sing at the old rugged cross oh so i'll cherish thank you lord the old rugged cross i'll cherish it i won't let it go thank you lord until my trophies hallelujah aren't you looking forward to that day one of these days i want to lay it down amen lay my crown before him i will cling to the old rugged cross oh and exchange [Music] the blood will never lose its power oh the blood [Music] way back on calvary back [Music] gives me strength [Music] [Music] it reaches thank you lord oh and it flows [Music] to [Music] from day [Music] still effective today and i was struck by what brother stewart said about the effectiveness of it it's not just the word but the effectiveness of it we want to have that effect in our lives don't we amen i wonder if we could just just have prayer just a moment i you can tell i'm struggling with my voice i am my voice has gotten worse and worse and worse it seems like everything i do it gets worse and i guess that just comes with preaching but it's getting where i can't sing and and these brothers help me tremendously in but you know i believe god can heal that too i believe god can take care of that too and i'm not used to struggling with that like i am i'm really pushing it and it cuts out sometimes and and just coming up here and i but i believe god's a healer maybe you've got something that i know healing just by the act of obedience of taking communion you know you can be healed but but maybe there's something specially that you just thought lord i i know you're a healer i believe you're going to heal this why don't you just put that on your mind your heart today and let's just ask him let's stand together and just ask him and and just take a moment and pray for physical healing if there's someone you know that needs healing you just pray right from where you're at and say lord i i believe you're gonna touch this person i i believe you're gonna do it today maybe it's you you really need a touch from god we believe he's a healer tonight amen let's just pray that way heavenly father lord jesus you see the need in my body god i know that you're jehovah jireh you're the provider of all our needs i know you're a healer god i i believe that you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're not bound by time lord we see what you did through a prophet god but we believe you're the same healer today maybe some of these that are watching today lord and lord they're there with their families they're sick my daughter is sick tonight lord in the other building i think and lord or wherever she's at she's right here tonight lord i i pray god that you would just move lord that you would heal her completely lord each one god even if it's a little thing god we we believe that you're a healer we believe you're the same yesterday today and forever i pray you'd reach down right now while your presence is here lord heal every every sick person we pray lord we believe that you've done it we claim it according to the promise of your word lord that you'd come and just make your word real in our lives lord heal every sick person we pray in the name of jesus lord we agree together as brother stewart read tonight if we two of us would agree on one thing lord each one of us agreeing here together tonight that these things will be done we believe it lord we thank you for it in jesus name amen amen do you believe it tonight amen god bless you amen i'm going to read from john chapter 13 and then we'll go to foot washing and you can just be dismissed as soon as we're done with foot washing hasn't it been a good day in the lord amen i've enjoyed the fellowship so much amen let's let's read in john chapter 13 and verse 1. now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being end of the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel think about that the god of heaven got down in front of his disciples and did the dirtiest job he could do because he loved him he says he loved him to the end oh it should be nothing we should love to do it for one another then right amen he said he rises from supper laid aside his garments took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a base and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the tower with he was girded and cometh simon peter and peter saith unto him lord thus i wash my feet jesus answered and said to him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shall never wash my feet jesus answered him before washed he not thou hast no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him he that is washed and he does not save to wash his feet aren't you glad to be washed tonight but it's clean every wet you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean after he had washed your feet and had taken his garments was set down again he said unto them know you what i have done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen let's pray one more time heavenly father thank you for allowing us to do this today lord it's just such a love in our hearts that we have for one another for the other members of the bride of christ we've heard today about unity lord about how we should stick together and stand together lord i pray that it would be that way lord as we wash each other's feet may we recognize that we do we're doing this because you did it for us lord and because we have love one for another and one to fellowship with one another not just here but one day we'll be able to fellowship lord in those new bodies and we thank you for that look forward to that day when we'll do this in another kingdom in another place we thank you for it in jesus name amen god bless you you can go the men here in the back and the women in the foyer and when you're done you can be dismissed god bless you [Music] you
