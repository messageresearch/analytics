[57:11] that today and believing that and that
[57:13] that's the case amen I want to turn to
[57:15] the Book of Job Job chapter
[57:23] 29
[57:27] I love
[57:30] technology job chapter
[57:39] 29 verse
[57:45] one moreover job continued his Parable
[57:48] and said oh that I were as in months
[57:52] past as in the days when God Pres
[57:54] preserved me when his candle shined upon
[57:57] my head when by his light I walked
[58:00] through
[58:02] Darkness as I was in the days of my
[58:07] youth when the secret of God was upon my
[58:12] Tabernacle when the almighty was yet
[58:14] with me when my children were about me
[58:18] when I washed my steps with butter and
[58:21] The Rock poured Me Out Rivers of oil I
[58:24] pray the Lord that His blessings to the
[58:25] word you may be
[58:33] seated oh that I was
[58:36] young oh to be young have you ever
[58:38] thought that like that oh to be as young
[58:41] as these guys and have that much energy
[58:44] and that kind of that kind of ability to
[58:47] put to the things of God oh to be young
[58:50] that's what job thought he said oh that
[58:52] I was young I I want to be young again
[58:55] in and yet we know that job was a great
[58:58] example of what we talked about this
[59:00] morning a suffering servant he's a great
[59:03] example of a servant of God who stuck
[59:07] with it who remained a servant of God
[59:10] who was who was somebody who was not
[59:12] shaken by the enemy Joel I can't hear
[59:15] myself out of these he he was not shaken
[59:18] by the enemy he was not shaken by uh
[59:21] things that would that would happen to
[59:23] him and and I want you to understand I
[59:26] want you young people to understand
[59:27] tonight bad things are going to happen
[59:31] life is not a Bed of Roses it's not
[59:32] going to be easy but you're going to
[59:34] make it you're you're going to make it
[59:37] you're going to be okay and and and it's
[59:39] not going to bring you down it's not
[59:41] going to take you out and and how do you
[59:43] know that because you can look at the
[59:45] example of job and you can look at the
[59:47] example of of others that you know and
[59:50] people even here in the church you can
[59:52] see that that thing this is not going to
[59:54] take take you down this is not going to
[59:56] be the end of your life this trial that
[59:58] you're going through this struggle I
[1:00:00] know it feels like that you're never
[1:00:01] going to make it and that this is the
[1:00:03] end of it and and you're never going to
[1:00:05] get any better and you're never going to
[1:00:06] get that girl to look at you and you're
[1:00:08] you're never going to you're never going
[1:00:10] to get a job and you're never going to
[1:00:11] be able to drive and you're never going
[1:00:13] to be able to do that but it's going to
[1:00:14] be okay you're going to make it because
[1:00:17] we made it and believe it or not we were
[1:00:20] young too
[1:00:22] once thanks trip
[1:00:27] oh that was him I blame
[1:00:28] trip we were young
[1:00:32] on we we we once we once we're young we
[1:00:35] once we scared to get up in front of
[1:00:37] people and sing and we we know what it's
[1:00:39] like to to make mistakes and we still
[1:00:43] make them but we've
[1:00:46] overcome we've made it and and you can
[1:00:49] look at the at the greatest person in
[1:00:51] the church and and and and with job the
[1:00:53] thing is with job was he was so such a
[1:00:56] man of integrity that God looked at job
[1:00:58] and and he and and he was proud of him
[1:01:01] in fact the Bible says that job was a he
[1:01:04] he was a man that uh that was perfect
[1:01:08] and upright in Job chapter 1 he was
[1:01:10] perfect and upright one that feared God
[1:01:13] and ASU evil so he was perfect and
[1:01:15] upright he says four things about him he
[1:01:18] was blameless he was upright he was
[1:01:21] reverent and he lived a holy life and
[1:01:24] you can't ask more of a man than that
[1:01:27] and God looked at him and said that's
[1:01:28] the kind of man he is and God's so proud
[1:01:30] of him that he goes to the devil and he
[1:01:32] said have you seen my servant
[1:01:35] job now you want to be recommended for
[1:01:38] promotion but how about being
[1:01:39] recommended for a
[1:01:42] trial job is in is such a good man he's
[1:01:45] such a man that God loves and and cares
[1:01:48] about so much that he actually
[1:01:49] recommends him and and and the thing is
[1:01:51] we look at job and we say well he he he
[1:01:54] made some mistakes he did some things
[1:01:56] that maybe he shouldn't have done and
[1:01:58] and and and yet he made it through all
[1:02:00] of that and we look at his trial and how
[1:02:02] he made it through his trial but what I
[1:02:03] want to know is how do I get so close to
[1:02:06] God that he actually says he can take
[1:02:09] it right he can take it he is he he is
[1:02:13] going to make it how do I get to a place
[1:02:15] where God trusts me so much that he says
[1:02:18] he's not going to give up is that what
[1:02:21] you want to be as as as young people
[1:02:23] when you get older because you're all
[1:02:25] getting older believe it or not you're
[1:02:26] going to get to our age you're going to
[1:02:28] get older if the Lord carries you're
[1:02:30] going to grow up and as you're growing
[1:02:31] up you want to be that person who
[1:02:33] doesn't quit you want to be that person
[1:02:34] who never gives up you want to be that
[1:02:36] person who stays in church even when
[1:02:38] everybody else leaves you be that person
[1:02:40] that doesn't
[1:02:42] leave right and how can you become that
[1:02:44] person how do I get from where I'm at
[1:02:46] and especially the older youth how do I
[1:02:48] get to from where I'm at to be that
[1:02:52] person how do I do that
[1:02:54] well you're going to have to be a
[1:02:55] servant of
[1:02:56] God you're going to have to be one that
[1:02:59] God can go speak to the devil about and
[1:03:01] say have you noticed job have you seen
[1:03:04] my servant job and then the Bible tells
[1:03:07] us in James 5:11 he said we count them
[1:03:09] happy which endure in other words the
[1:03:12] ones that make it he said you have heard
[1:03:14] of the patience of Job have seen the end
[1:03:16] of the Lord the Lord is very pitiful and
[1:03:18] of tender mercy so how do we get to be
[1:03:23] job how do we get to be job and let me
[1:03:26] make it a little bit more personal than
[1:03:27] that is everybody paying attention this
[1:03:29] afternoon come on let's make it a little
[1:03:31] bit more
[1:03:32] personal how do I get to be Danny
[1:03:37] Ward you
[1:03:39] boys how do I get to be girls how do I
[1:03:42] get to be Vicky where I want pick on
[1:03:43] them because they they're pillars in the
[1:03:48] church how do I get to be
[1:03:51] them you know they didn't get to be them
[1:03:54] by by just taking a pill of some kind of
[1:03:56] magic pill and then suddenly you become
[1:03:58] Danny Ward you just don't become that
[1:04:01] right you don't just become sister Vicki
[1:04:04] by and being such a blessing to the
[1:04:06] church by uh by everybody just doing
[1:04:09] everything for you there's some things
[1:04:10] you have to do you're going to have to
[1:04:13] make some decisions you're going to have
[1:04:15] to step up and and you're going to have
[1:04:17] to you're going to have to start
[1:04:18] becoming a person that will not turn
[1:04:21] your back on the word a person that
[1:04:23] notices the word and and wants to be and
[1:04:26] and maybe you don't understand
[1:04:28] everything but what you do understand
[1:04:30] you're going to stick with
[1:04:31] it you're you're going to make mistakes
[1:04:35] but if you'll remember the C your
[1:04:36] creator in the days of your
[1:04:38] youth while the evil days come not
[1:04:41] because I think all of us that are older
[1:04:42] especially you that are very much older
[1:04:44] than I am you can say I wish I was young
[1:04:47] again I wish I was I wish I had my
[1:04:49] strength but I wouldn't give up I
[1:04:51] wouldn't want to give up my faith I
[1:04:53] wouldn't want to give up up what I am
[1:04:55] because God has made me what I
[1:04:57] am so how can I become that how can I be
[1:05:00] that and you become that by becoming a
[1:05:02] faithful servant a faithful Steward of
[1:05:03] your
[1:05:05] youth that's good and I want to speak to
[1:05:07] us as parents too because we want to be
[1:05:10] faithful stewards of our youth to use a
[1:05:13] little play on words of of our young
[1:05:15] people and how do we become that how do
[1:05:18] we do
[1:05:19] that you see if you want to be a
[1:05:21] faithful servant you've got to be
[1:05:22] faithful in your habits
[1:05:24] yes amen you got to be faithful in your
[1:05:26] habits I've asked some of the elders
[1:05:28] what's the best thing we could do for
[1:05:30] our young people to make sure that they
[1:05:31] stay in church and they said most
[1:05:34] everyone I asked said the same thing
[1:05:35] they said be faithful to the house of
[1:05:37] God Amen just go to church yes the Bible
[1:05:42] says wherewith all shall a young man
[1:05:44] cleanse his way by taking heed thereto
[1:05:47] according to the word not only going to
[1:05:49] church but when it comes to reading the
[1:05:51] Bible when it comes to praying we need
[1:05:53] to develop faithful habit you young
[1:05:55] people start right now start right now
[1:05:58] don't wait till your parents do it start
[1:06:01] right now you say well we don't have a
[1:06:03] family altar in my home you have a
[1:06:04] family altar amen you got Bibles you got
[1:06:08] You' got the ability to even many of you
[1:06:10] have the message you got the message on
[1:06:12] on your phone if you have a phone or on
[1:06:14] some device in your home you read that
[1:06:17] you may not understand it all but read
[1:06:19] it and listen to it and and and read the
[1:06:21] Bible find out what God Said for your
[1:06:25] be faithful to those things that's how
[1:06:26] you become a job that's how you become
[1:06:29] somebody who can stand through the
[1:06:31] trial by by actually choosing Godly
[1:06:35] habits in your life if you want to be a
[1:06:38] faithful servant be faithful to the
[1:06:40] sacrifice yes the Bible tells us that
[1:06:43] job was faithful when he come before God
[1:06:46] he'd come continually for his children
[1:06:48] continually he offered a sacrifice for
[1:06:50] his children because he believed that
[1:06:52] the sacrifice was effective listen we've
[1:06:54] got to be like that I'm going to go
[1:06:57] continually Before the Throne of God as
[1:06:59] parents we're got to go continually
[1:07:01] Before the Throne of God for our
[1:07:02] children don't quit when they leave the
[1:07:04] house don't quit when they get older but
[1:07:06] continually Before the Throne of God
[1:07:09] Amen with the brand an altar call he
[1:07:12] says he says this he said talk about
[1:07:15] people that were standing up he said I
[1:07:18] pray you'll you'll bless those who are
[1:07:19] standing pray you'll give them the
[1:07:21] desire of their heart if it's lust if
[1:07:22] it's indifference if it's fear
[1:07:24] if it's anything they have need of Lord
[1:07:25] cleanse their hearts and souls this day
[1:07:27] may they go from here a changed person
[1:07:30] if they've been neglecting reading the
[1:07:32] Bible because many times that's what
[1:07:34] leads to those other things when you
[1:07:36] neglect the
[1:07:37] word may they read it every day for it
[1:07:40] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:07:42] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:07:43] from the mouth of God he said may they
[1:07:45] read it and live on it and thrive on it
[1:07:47] and pattern their life to the word of
[1:07:49] God and they shall have the promise of
[1:07:52] God do you want the promises of God how
[1:07:53] many young people want the promises of
[1:07:55] God to be fulfilled in your life I I I
[1:07:57] need healing in my life I need salvation
[1:07:59] I want the promises of God then how are
[1:08:01] you going to get the promises of God you
[1:08:03] got to be faithful to the house of God
[1:08:05] you got to be faithful to the word of
[1:08:06] God and I want to challenge you that you
[1:08:09] can do that now you don't have to wait
[1:08:10] to do that do it now be a generation
[1:08:14] that changes the culture of the church
[1:08:16] be a generation that that says we're not
[1:08:18] going to do it no more we're not going
[1:08:20] to take a a back in religion we're not
[1:08:22] going to be L to see it we're going to
[1:08:23] be on fire for God we're going to do
[1:08:26] what it takes to have a church that has
[1:08:28] the power of God you can do
[1:08:33] that that's good
[1:08:35] so David said one thing of I desire of
[1:08:38] the Lord and that will I seek after I
[1:08:39] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:08:41] days of my life let me be like that let
[1:08:43] me have that
[1:08:44] desire to serve God you say well my
[1:08:46] parents won't go will you go if you're
[1:08:49] old

[1:08:53] you get old enough to drive you get old
[1:08:54] enough to have a job no it's on
[1:08:57] you you can't blame your parents for not
[1:09:00] being spiritual
[1:09:02] anymore it's on you at some point you're
[1:09:05] going to need to step up and be a
[1:09:07] Christian that's right you're going to
[1:09:09] need to step up and read the word
[1:09:11] yourself you need to step up and and
[1:09:13] learn what it's like to repent of your
[1:09:15] sins and admit when you're wrong and be
[1:09:17] able to be a man and or be a a young
[1:09:19] lady that'll that'll be honest about it
[1:09:21] and take it and and do what's right tell
[1:09:24] somebody about it when you need help you
[1:09:26] got to take that responsibility don't
[1:09:28] wait on somebody else you do it
[1:09:31] amen to go to
[1:09:33] church say well that's you know you
[1:09:36] can't preach to kids to go to church
[1:09:37] because they get drugged there
[1:09:40] anyway but I want you to I want you to
[1:09:42] start now how did job continually offer
[1:09:45] a sacrifice because at some point during
[1:09:46] his youth he looks back he says I wish I
[1:09:48] was young again at some point during his
[1:09:50] youth he went to the house of God made a
[1:09:53] sacrifice
[1:09:54] maybe his parents did it maybe they
[1:09:56] taught him how to do it I don't know but
[1:09:57] he did it right and brother brandham
[1:10:00] tells us that he said how can you stay
[1:10:03] he said how can you say you can stay
[1:10:05] home and be just as good a Christian as
[1:10:06] you would be at
[1:10:08] church now what does that say you you
[1:10:10] all you you young people can
[1:10:12] read what does it
[1:10:15] say you can't do it
[1:10:18] right right right you can't stay home
[1:10:23] and be just a Christian as you would be
[1:10:24] at church you can't do it he said read
[1:10:27] the word the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[1:10:30] word the Bible is God's spiritual diet
[1:10:33] for his
[1:10:34] church and the Holy Spirit is the one
[1:10:36] who brings it to you and places it in
[1:10:38] the heart so what is he saying you got
[1:10:39] to go to church where the word is read
[1:10:41] but then the Holy Spirit Waters it
[1:10:44] brings it to you and places it in the
[1:10:45] heart with Thanksgiving you water it and
[1:10:47] every Divine promise will produce just
[1:10:50] exactly what God said it would do aren't
[1:10:52] you glad for that promise today it'll
[1:10:54] produce young people that are on fire
[1:10:56] for God it'll produce a generation that
[1:10:58] will not make excuses that will not will
[1:11:00] not rely on somebody else but they'll
[1:11:02] believe God for
[1:11:04] themselves it'll produce a people like
[1:11:06] that oh I'm so glad that our God still
[1:11:08] produces children like
[1:11:11] that that's
[1:11:13] good now if Satan can get you separated
[1:11:17] from the church he'll attack you and
[1:11:18] he'll do anything he he can to do that
[1:11:21] and you got to take responsibility as

[1:18:18] Time that sounds radical it does sound
[1:18:20] radical it makes you different we're
[1:18:22] going to have to make be different
[1:18:23] people to make it in a
[1:18:26] Rapture so you need to be you know job
[1:18:30] is gives us a little bit of a clue you
[1:18:32] forgive me tonight I'm just talking to
[1:18:34] you in my heart job gives us a clue of
[1:18:37] what kind of a person that he was he
[1:18:39] made a covenant with his
[1:18:41] eyes the Bible says in job 31:1 I made a
[1:18:44] covenant with mine eyes why then should
[1:18:45] I think upon a maiden this is more for
[1:18:48] the older ones but I want you to get
[1:18:50] this the brand said what do you desire
[1:18:53] when a woman comes down the street
[1:18:54] dressed like that and you men turn your
[1:18:56] head gaze around like that you're not
[1:18:57] using the thinking man's filter because
[1:18:59] when you do that you're committing
[1:19:00] adultery for the filter said whosoever
[1:19:02] lookth upon a woman to lust after her
[1:19:04] has committed adultery with her already
[1:19:05] turn your head thinking man get away
[1:19:08] from her she's not pretty she's a
[1:19:09] serpent right twists like one acts like
[1:19:11] one stings like one say well that's
[1:19:14] pretty harsh well that's what the Bible
[1:19:16] says the way to her house is a house is
[1:19:18] a way of death and the Bible tells us he
[1:19:21] said if if your eye offends you pluck it
[1:19:23] out and that does not mean you need to
[1:19:24] pull your eye out or poke it out what it
[1:19:28] means is do what it
[1:19:30] takes to live a Christian Life to keep
[1:19:34] your thought life right and if that
[1:19:36] requires you to be without a phone you'd
[1:19:38] be better off without a phone then with
[1:19:39] that in your mind amen if that requ if
[1:19:43] if that requires you to uh have a
[1:19:45] counselor and and talk to somebody and
[1:19:47] tell them things that you maybe wouldn't
[1:19:49] want anybody to know but you're we're
[1:19:50] willing to do that why are you willing
[1:19:52] to do that because you you want to go to
[1:19:54] heaven you want to make it you don't
[1:19:55] want to deal with those things you don't
[1:19:57] want to carry those things into
[1:19:59] marriage cuz it doesn't get better so
[1:20:01] you're going to have to do what it takes
[1:20:03] I want to challenge you young people
[1:20:04] start now amen start dressing right not
[1:20:07] because somebody tells you to dress
[1:20:09] right but because the word says it start
[1:20:12] living right because the word says
[1:20:14] it it's better to be like without a
[1:20:17] phone than to than to see some of the
[1:20:19] stuff on it yeah that's the truth yeah
[1:20:23] you got to wrestle with that word
[1:20:24] yourself we're not going to make a law
[1:20:26] says you can or can't do certain things
[1:20:27] you got to you got to take
[1:20:29] responsibility and do that and I think
[1:20:32] as as we get farther along it becomes
[1:20:34] younger and younger that we have to deal
[1:20:35] with those things brother brandom says
[1:20:37] sometimes you may think it doesn't pay
[1:20:39] off you say well this is hard Ben he
[1:20:42] said but it certainly does pay off yes
[1:20:45] it's got to pay off I'm a testimony
[1:20:47] today it pays off all the hard work
[1:20:49] brother Jason all of it it pays off down
[1:20:52] the road
[1:20:53] I I can testify to you that you you
[1:20:55] girls that it pays off that if you'll do
[1:20:57] what's right if you'll if you'll keep
[1:20:59] your eyes right if you'll keep your mind
[1:21:01] right if you'll keep it pays off down
[1:21:03] the road he he said you cannot be going
[1:21:06] east and west at the same time you can't
[1:21:08] be going right and left at the same time
[1:21:10] the Bible says why stand between two
[1:21:13] opinions some of us older ones need to
[1:21:15] need need to hear that why stand between
[1:21:18] two opinions you can't be going one way
[1:21:20] and the other way at the same time you
[1:21:23] you got to come out he said if you'll
[1:21:24] set your mind and eyes and motives and
[1:21:26] objectives in life on the right thing
[1:21:28] you got to come out on the right thing
[1:21:30] that's the only way no matter how much
[1:21:32] you're tempted to do the other side turn
[1:21:33] your head from it do what's right and
[1:21:36] you know you're right he said you'll
[1:21:37] feel better and you are better that's
[1:21:40] just all there is to it you're going to
[1:21:41] come out right do you believe that amen
[1:21:44] I want to tell you kids are you still
[1:21:47] listening look for an opportunity to do
[1:21:50] good right all right job did job 29:15

[1:21:58] blind feet was out of the lame I was a
[1:22:01] father to the poor the cause which I
[1:22:04] knew not I searched out how do you

[1:25:27] preaching the gospel if there's any
[1:25:29] regrets that I have he said if I could
[1:25:31] touch a button this morning and go back
[1:25:33] to the fabulous age of about 16 or 17 he
[1:25:35] said I would only want to do it for one
[1:25:37] thing to serve Christ he said that's
[1:25:40] what it means to serve Christ Alone he
[1:25:42] said God who knows my heart knows that's
[1:25:44] true serve Christ Alone he said I've
[1:25:46] never seen anything or thought anything
[1:25:48] that ever compared with this blessed
[1:25:50] anchor of Christ in my heart I don't
[1:25:52] don't know nothing he said I've sailed
[1:25:53] the Seas I flew through the air I've
[1:25:55] seen the sights the world has I've seen
[1:25:57] the seven outstanding sights of the
[1:25:58] world he said I've seen all the mountain
[1:26:00] sites pretty near of the world wouldn't
[1:26:01] that be nice to be able to hunt anywhere
[1:26:03] you wanted to hunt be able to go to all
[1:26:05] the different places and be able to fish
[1:26:07] wherever you could fish wouldn't that be
[1:26:08] wonderful that some of you young people
[1:26:09] would love to be able to do that be able
[1:26:11] to travel and go across the world he
[1:26:13] said I've done all that and I wouldn't
[1:26:15] trade any of it for
[1:26:17] Christ he said I I've fished I I've rode
[1:26:20] horses I've ranched I've done everything
[1:26:21] I knew to do and I'll say this they're
[1:26:23] all of it put together he said won't
[1:26:25] make one little dot to the love of the
[1:26:26] Lord Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ what could I do he said oh yes he
[1:26:30] said these little kidy here he said I've
[1:26:32] had my little
[1:26:36] girlfriends you boys never had that did
[1:26:38] you brother brandom did he said slick my
[1:26:42] hair down put my windshield back on my
[1:26:43] car I don't even know what that means
[1:26:45] and they they used to drive around with
[1:26:47] them
[1:26:48] off some of you older Elders are going
[1:26:50] to know what that means and tell me
[1:26:52] after the church after
[1:26:55] church but he said I slick my hair down
[1:26:58] he was a man just like we are how do you
[1:27:01] become William brandom and I don't mean
[1:27:03] to have his gift but how do you become
[1:27:05] the kind that have that kind of
[1:27:09] Integrity how do you do that he said I
[1:27:12] used to be young I used to Slick my hair
[1:27:15] down put the windshield on the
[1:27:20] caruh he said went out with my date but
[1:27:23] it just didn't
[1:27:25] satisfy some of you think well if I
[1:27:27] could just go out on a date my life
[1:27:29] would be so much
[1:27:32] better been there and done
[1:27:35] that don't want to go
[1:27:42] back he said it didn't satisfy there's
[1:27:45] something you're lacking all the time he
[1:27:47] said I've seen the girl with the Pretty
[1:27:49] Brown
[1:27:51] Eyes
[1:27:52] I've seen the girl with the Pretty Brown
[1:27:54] Eyes I married the girl with the Pretty
[1:27:55] Brown
[1:27:58] Eyes I married the the only girl I ever
[1:28:02] dated and and you know at the time I
[1:28:05] thought well my life's
[1:28:08] complete but I wouldn't give even that
[1:28:11] for
[1:28:13] Christ he he said I thought that was
[1:28:15] just it if I could only have the date
[1:28:16] with this young lady it would take all
[1:28:18] my anxiety that would just settle it I'd
[1:28:21] have a date with her be out with her 15
[1:28:23] minutes and look for someone
[1:28:25] else not brother Brandon well he was a
[1:28:27] human like we
[1:28:29] are said it just doesn't satisfy oh
[1:28:31] there's nothing but that blessed hour
[1:28:33] blessed be his name down a little old
[1:28:36] Coal Shed in the back of a building
[1:28:37] kneeling on an old grass sack in an
[1:28:39] alley where I knelt down there in the
[1:28:40] wet ground and said Lord Jesus can you
[1:28:42] do something for me I wonder if we could
[1:28:44] say that this morning you young people
[1:28:46] Lord Jesus can you do something for me I
[1:28:48] I I need you Lord I want you to be in my
[1:28:50] life I want you to be I want you to lead
[1:28:52] me I want you to guide me I need you

[1:28:57] passes all understanding anchored in his
[1:28:59] heart of mine it's worth all there is in
[1:29:01] the whole world he said I've never seen
[1:29:03] nothing to compare with it I trusted him
[1:29:05] in the hours of sickness and accident
[1:29:07] it'll come I've trusted him when the
[1:29:09] airplanes was spinning in the storm he
[1:29:11] said Lord Jesus are you finished with me
[1:29:13] if not straighten this plane out and see
[1:29:15] her smooth around her right condition I
[1:29:17] stood in the clinic where the best of
