[45:44] just Inspire their souls the Lord to
[45:46] more faith and I better walk with you I
[45:49] pray you would be with each one now we
[45:51] ask in Jesus name
[45:52] amen
[45:53] amen are you happy to be in the house of
[45:55] the Lord tonight
[45:56] man it's good to be here I'm a little
[45:58] under the weather you forgive my voice I
[46:00] I feel good I just my voice hadn't come
[46:03] back yet and so maybe it'll warm up and
[46:06] and it'll be all right
[46:08] if you have your Bibles I'll let you
[46:10] turn to Matthew 5 48 just one verse just
[46:13] one verse here before you're seated to
[46:16] Matthew 5 verse 48.
[46:19] amen are you happy to be in the house of
[46:20] the Lord on a Wednesday night all the
[46:22] things we could be doing I'm sure but uh
[46:25] there's no tornadoes outside that I know
[46:26] of so that that's good and y'all are
[46:29] still here I don't guess nobody was hurt
[46:30] last night hey man it woke us up was up
[46:34] the sirens was going off in Cherokee for
[46:36] seemed like forever and and my daughter
[46:40] was awake and she's finally we said well
[46:42] the tornadoes are passing she said yay
[46:45] she was done so were weak I was ready to
[46:47] sleep and then sirens and my phone go
[46:49] off and my wife's phone I was like my
[46:50] goodness you know I gotta preach
[46:52] tomorrow night and work tomorrow so
[46:54] Satan was just just fighting a little
[46:56] bit but you know what
[46:57] it don't matter how much he fights
[46:59] there's always Victory to the believer
[47:02] doesn't matter what we go through God is
[47:04] always there to give us what we need not
[47:06] always what we want but what we need
[47:07] tonight I've been listening to some of
[47:09] the Easter sermons if you get a chance
[47:11] to go listen to some of the ones that
[47:13] brother Brandon preached around this
[47:14] time right before Easter he deals with
[47:17] so many things and uh about perfection
[47:20] and he deals with a lot of things about
[47:22] a perfect sacrifice and and about the
[47:25] things that would come right before
[47:25] Easter and he deals a lot about the law
[47:27] and and things like that and if you go
[47:30] listen to some of those sermons they're
[47:31] just just look at some of the Easter
[47:33] sermons and go back just a few tapes
[47:34] they're just so inspiring and so good
[47:37] because he takes it kind of like a drama
[47:38] it seemed like on every one of my
[47:40] Founders like a drama that he would
[47:41] preach and it was just making it real
[47:45] and when you can really bring into Focus
[47:47] what Calvary did for us this time of
[47:49] year
[47:50] it can change your entire outlook on
[47:52] life it makes the politics in the world
[47:55] it makes what's happening with the
[47:57] previous president of the current
[47:58] president or who will be president next
[47:59] it makes those things seem so small
[48:02] because those things don't really have
[48:04] any effect on our future at all
[48:07] it does a little on this current life
[48:09] but it has no effect on our Eternal
[48:11] destination I'm thankful for that this
[48:13] world is not our final resting place it
[48:15] is not our final destination but we are
[48:18] going somewhere where there's no more
[48:20] politics there is no more uh sickness
[48:23] there's no more death there's nothing
[48:24] that can interfere with our joy and our
[48:26] happiness and just an eternal perfection
[48:29] and that's what we want to go to and
[48:31] that's what we want to get ready for
[48:32] here and so I'm sorry I'll let you be
[48:34] seated just a second let's read this be
[48:36] therefore perfect even as your father
[48:38] which is head in heaven is perfect you
[48:41] may be seated
[48:43] and I did start my timer and it's
[48:44] running so I will be out of here on time
[48:47] tonight Lord willing
[48:49] brother Branham goes on to say this in a
[48:51] message Perfection he said God requires
[48:53] perfection
[48:54] we want to bear that in mind that there
[48:56] is nothing just part way can go in the
[48:58] presence of God it must be perfect or
[49:02] worship everything he said now in the
[49:05] Garden of Eden God had Adam and Eve in
[49:07] the garden and they had sinned and
[49:09] transgressed the laws of God by sinning
[49:11] and Disobedience and when transgression
[49:14] comes disobedience is the transgression
[49:16] of the law and the law of God him being
[49:19] holy just unadulterated holy therefore
[49:22] no spot of unholiness can ever stand in
[49:24] his presence he said so if sin came in
[49:27] the world by transgression then sin must
[49:30] be dealt with before the sinner can ever
[49:32] stand in the presence of God
[49:34] and so in the Old Testament when Adam
[49:36] and Eve were there it was all Perfection
[49:38] there was no sin there was no death
[49:40] there was no sickness there was nothing
[49:42] could enter this perfect place called
[49:44] Eden it was Perfection it is something
[49:46] that we strive to go back to but it is
[49:49] something that we we can't and this
[49:50] flesh go to it is something that we can
[49:52] only achieve through the blood that God
[49:55] had God's son had shed for us and so you
[49:59] can see through the law there there had
[50:00] to come a death so every time they would
[50:02] sin there had to be an atonement made
[50:04] and so they would use a lamb and brother
[50:06] Braden will tell the story and he will
[50:08] dramatize that over and over about a
[50:10] lamb and how it would have to be slain
[50:11] every time someone would would sin and
[50:14] every year maybe the worshiper would
[50:16] have to go kill a lamb for the sins he
[50:17] had done for that year think about it
[50:19] every year it was never Perfection it
[50:22] was always that was sinning we're
[50:24] messing up and brother Brandon said they
[50:25] would go out of the tents or out of the
[50:27] congregation he said that after they had
[50:30] just killed the lamb
[50:32] they had just put their hands on the
[50:33] jugular vein they had just killed this
[50:36] lamb and they had felt the blood all
[50:38] over the worshiper brother random called
[50:39] it and he said the blood was all over
[50:41] him and when the blood got there and he
[50:44] said he said the worshiper still would
[50:46] leave that lamb and go away and still
[50:48] have the same desire he had when he came
[50:50] to the land he said the same desire he
[50:52] said that blood of the animal could not
[50:54] change the life of the human and that's
[50:57] what brother Branham had brought in he
[50:59] said that was not Perfection it was just
[51:01] a a law it was something that that was
[51:04] permitted he said because there was
[51:05] going to be a Perfection by a lamb so it
[51:08] was just something to show you what was
[51:10] to come but he said and they would do
[51:12] that think about the thousands of years
[51:14] that they had to do this how many lambs
[51:16] had to be killed for the sins of the
[51:17] people innocent Lambs they had never
[51:19] done anything but innocently had to be
[51:21] killed because people's lives could not
[51:23] be transformed by the blood
[51:26] so the blood and they would sit there
[51:28] and brother Brave talked about it and if
[51:30] you ever go hear the drama he just makes
[51:32] it so real he said the sinner would
[51:34] would have to kill this lamb and he said
[51:36] you had to feel it you had to get right
[51:38] down on the lamb and the lamb had to had
[51:40] to die in such a way that it would try
[51:42] to make you feel bad it would it would
[51:44] make you feel so guilty so bad that this
[51:46] lamb had to be something that would die
[51:48] for you because of how bad you've been
[51:50] because of the sin you committed not the
[51:53] lamb but what you did and the lamb had
[51:55] to die for you and he said he would hold
[51:57] that thing and he said he would take a
[51:58] rock a sharp Rock and he would cut that
[52:00] juggler and the blood would spray
[52:02] everywhere and he said the the wool
[52:03] would turn red and he said the the
[52:05] worshiper would stand there just covered
[52:07] in blood from a lamb and he said even
[52:09] after all of that the worshiper would go
[52:11] out and his heart would still desire sin
[52:15] think about it
[52:17] something that dramatic that that horse
[52:21] of a punishment for an animal that
[52:22] didn't deserve death
[52:24] and yet the worshiper would still have
[52:26] the desire see that's what Satan has put
[52:28] in you if you have a desire to sin that
[52:30] did not come from God that has come
[52:33] straight from the devil and you think
[52:35] about it God and brother Brandon goes on
[52:37] down he said the law required it justice
[52:39] required the law and he said when the
[52:42] law he said now the law cannot save us
[52:44] the law was just the thing that put us
[52:46] in the jail he said but it has no
[52:48] redeeming power the law showed us that
[52:51] we were Sinners it condemned us it
[52:54] condemned this the worshiper to see the
[52:56] lamb bloody and and it condemned them to
[52:59] feel the the the heartbeat go away from
[53:01] that lamb it condemned the worshiper but
[53:03] it didn't change his life there was no
[53:06] power there to change a life but there
[53:08] was power to condemn there was it was
[53:09] condemnation if you go out here and you
[53:11] speed through Hardy and and the the
[53:13] patrolman sees you he's going to pull
[53:14] you over and write you a ticket or take
[53:16] you to jail or whatever the offense is
[53:17] he's gonna he's gonna make the the
[53:19] penalty uh the crime backs the penalty
[53:21] the penalty match the crime and he's
[53:22] going to do that because why it's not
[53:24] Perfection but it is a law that is
[53:26] trying to make you do something
[53:28] but it doesn't change who you are many
[53:31] times you get a speeding ticket and the
[53:32] next day you're speeding again it
[53:33] doesn't change anything but it is a law
[53:35] the law can't change you
[53:39] Allison don't be looking at Stuart like
[53:41] that
[53:43] see the law can't change you he said God
[53:46] being holy and just he had to have a
[53:50] prosecution
[53:51] he had to prosecute The Sinner because
[53:54] he had overstepped the boundaries of
[53:55] Grace
[53:56] it had become a law-breaking citizen
[53:59] brother Bradham said
[54:00] I don't care how good your family is I
[54:03] don't care how good your pastor is I
[54:05] don't care what your family tree looks
[54:07] like I can trace it right back to a
[54:09] fallen family in the garden
[54:10] every one of us can there's not one
[54:13] above another you say well I'm from a
[54:15] rich family I'm from a poor family it
[54:17] doesn't matter I can take you all back
[54:19] to the same family every one of you are
[54:21] from a fallen family in the Garden of
[54:23] Eden me too every one of us we can't
[54:25] change that on our own only the grace of
[54:28] God can change that can take you from a
[54:31] fallen family a fallen generation
[54:33] somebody who had no right to live who
[54:37] had to sacrifice animals and and go in
[54:39] and couldn't even come into the temple
[54:41] at times because of the sins you had
[54:43] committed and then God made a way to
[54:46] change your entire course of history
[54:48] that's what I want I want a god like
[54:50] that I don't want a god who's making me
[54:52] go back to the the feast days and and to
[54:55] do all the law over again I can't live
[54:57] under the law because it can't change my
[54:59] life it can't change my family's life
[55:01] but I know a God who should a lamb who
[55:04] could change the entire history of my
[55:07] family your family no matter what you've
[55:10] been through who you came from who your
[55:12] daddy was who your mommy was every one
[55:16] of us have been changed by a lamb
[55:19] he said every law has a penalty and the
[55:23] penalty of transgressing God's law is
[55:25] death
[55:25] it had to project death to the human
[55:28] race all of the human race is under the
[55:30] penalty of this law he said that when
[55:32] Adam and Eve had sinned there was no way
[55:34] no other remedy that they could ever
[55:36] stand in the presence of God again
[55:38] except this sin be dealt with no man can
[55:41] commit sin of any type no matter how
[55:43] little or how big that individual sin
[55:45] has to be dealt with before the one who
[55:47] committed it can ever stand in the
[55:49] presence of a holy God so brother
[55:51] Bradham goes on he talks about Adam he
[55:52] said Eve Adam and Eve had sinned and had
[55:55] transgressed the law they were subjects
[55:57] of death and the law had to be executed
[55:59] therefore it put all the human race
[56:02] under the penalty of death he said now
[56:04] if we can only look at this great
[56:07] picture and remember that every person
[56:10] here is included in this every person
[56:14] not a one of us can brag on our family
[56:16] tree too far back
[56:18] doesn't matter if you had a good dad
[56:19] good mom doesn't matter
[56:22] he could only go so far before you get
[56:24] right back to the beginning where they
[56:25] where they fell right can only go so far
[56:27] and then you find out hey I'm related to
[56:29] that person I didn't like
[56:31] I'm related to that person that you know
[56:34] that I don't like their personality I
[56:35] don't like the way they act hey I'm
[56:36] related to them
[56:38] we're all just humans every one of us
[56:41] have sinned and come short of the glory
[56:43] of God at some time no matter how
[56:44] perfect you think you are in your flesh
[56:46] your flesh has never been converted so
[56:49] it cannot be perfect
[56:51] it can be brought under subjection but
[56:52] not perfected
[56:54] right he said every man and woman child
[56:56] is included in the penalty of death by
[56:58] the transgression of the head of the
[57:01] human race Adam by his transgression
[57:03] every one of us fell victim to sin think
[57:07] about it every one of us
[57:09] neither one of us could escape the
[57:11] Judgment of sin because of that because
[57:13] of what he did because of what he did in
[57:15] the beginning he said and sin must be
[57:18] dealt with he said now notice this sin
[57:20] God being just he could do nothing else
[57:24] but be just for he is the resource of
[57:27] all Justice he said and there would be
[57:29] nothing else for him to do but to place
[57:31] the penalty for this transgression and
[57:34] the penalty was death for he said this
[57:36] day you eat thereof
[57:38] that day you shall surely die
[57:40] he said no it's a dark picture we have
[57:42] here
[57:43] but if we go back just a little bit
[57:45] farther and find out the very attributes
[57:49] of God and I like how he does this
[57:51] brother Bram goes on and he says the
[57:53] Bible plainly tells us that God is love
[57:55] but yet being loved he has to be just
[57:59] so love does not mean just a thing that
[58:01] could be petted and played with love is
[58:03] the justice of God and he said now when
[58:05] God had seen that his children had
[58:07] transgressed his law and and that they
[58:09] must die the death then Sovereign Love
[58:12] stepped in to make a way for God had
[58:14] seen that these children was to be
[58:17] absolutely totally annihilated from his
[58:19] presence there was nothing else to be
[58:22] done for they had transgressed the laws
[58:25] and the penalty of his law of God's law
[58:28] was death
[58:30] so then the love of God went out for his
[58:33] subjects think about this
[58:35] he knew that they had to face death
[58:38] because he had already said it if you
[58:40] eat of this tree you will die you've got
[58:43] to die
[58:44] so he knew he said God has to keep his
[58:46] word he knew he had to keep his word but
[58:49] he loved this subject so much he loved
[58:52] his children so much there had to be
[58:54] some way to redeem them and bring them
[58:56] back brother Stewart's been preaching on
[58:59] Redemption worship under Redemption you
[59:02] can't worship until you've been redeemed
[59:04] because you're still under the law of
[59:07] sin but then when you're redeemed you're
[59:10] no longer under the law but you're now
[59:13] living in the Realms of Grace that's
[59:16] where I want to live that's where you're
[59:18] living today you say well well I I
[59:21] there's a legalist group over here and
[59:22] these people are legal about this listen
[59:24] if there's any way they're ever going to
[59:26] be saved they had to come by Grace had
[59:30] to there's no other way but by grace
[59:33] the love of God projecting his grace
[59:35] upon the human race because had he not
[59:38] shared Grace every one of us would been
[59:40] had been dead and there would be no race
[59:42] left we all deserve nothing but death
[59:46] and so then the love of God he said when
[59:48] Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace
[59:50] produces the object of love I'll say
[59:53] that again when Divine love is projected
[59:57] he shows us love he shows his Divine
[59:59] love projects it to you Sovereign Grace
[1:00:03] freely is given
[1:00:05] to every one of you it's the object of
[1:00:09] love it produces the object of love and
[1:00:11] he said in God by foreknowledge when he
[1:00:13] loved his race so well he said yet with
[1:00:16] the penalty he caused the
[1:00:18] substitutionary death to take place in
[1:00:20] the Garden of Eden he substituted an
[1:00:23] innocent creature a Little Lamb
[1:00:26] and brother Brandon goes on down and he
[1:00:27] says all through the Old Testament they
[1:00:29] offered the blood of lambs goats sheep
[1:00:31] bulls and Heifers a substitute death but
[1:00:34] all in the great economy of God there
[1:00:36] was back in his mind
[1:00:38] a real object coming
[1:00:41] he said there were Shadows of what was
[1:00:45] to come
[1:00:46] these were just types of what would come
[1:00:50] the lamb that was dying was a shadow God
[1:00:53] was allowing this to be a substitute for
[1:00:56] now because he knew what was going to
[1:00:58] come
[1:01:00] think about it all this time he allowed
[1:01:02] us to sin and be redeemed sin and be
[1:01:04] redeemed all throughout the years all
[1:01:06] the hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:01:08] but he knew that that was not going to
[1:01:10] last forever
[1:01:11] there had to come something to redeem
[1:01:14] the human race back to what she was at
[1:01:17] one time before the fall
[1:01:20] and so all through the Old Testament he
[1:01:22] said was it was a type and it was a
[1:01:23] shadow he said but he knew the real
[1:01:25] object was to come
[1:01:27] he said his only begotten son all the
[1:01:30] Lambs that died was only a shadow
[1:01:32] and a shadow is only the negative side
[1:01:35] of an object
[1:01:36] and they only spoke of a Calvary coming
[1:01:40] in Hebrews the 10th chapter
[1:01:43] it tells us the same thing brother
[1:01:44] Brandon's talked about he said for the
[1:01:45] law having a shadow of good things to
[1:01:47] come and not the very image of the
[1:01:49] things can never with those sacrifices
[1:01:51] which they offered year by year
[1:01:53] continually make the comers their own
[1:01:56] too perfect
[1:01:57] for then would they not have ceased to
[1:02:00] be offered because that the worshiper
[1:02:02] once purged should have had no more
[1:02:05] conscience of sins let's see brother
[1:02:07] Branham tells us they kept as soon as
[1:02:09] they left the sacrifice they still had a
[1:02:11] desire to sin
[1:02:12] they went away with the desire to sin to
[1:02:15] commit sin
[1:02:16] but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:02:18] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:02:21] year so something that had to be done
[1:02:22] every year think about it every year we
[1:02:24] got to come back and do this over
[1:02:25] because I because I'm a sinner
[1:02:28] I just can't seem to you you see
[1:02:30] Christians today that try to do the same
[1:02:32] thing every time there's an altar call
[1:02:35] they come and it's okay some people need
[1:02:37] to that's okay I'm not condemning that
[1:02:39] but but every time they feel just a
[1:02:40] little condemnation
[1:02:42] that shows they're still living in the
[1:02:44] Realms of the law they're still
[1:02:45] condemned in their heart but if you ever
[1:02:48] accept the sacrifices it really is
[1:02:50] then you've accepted Grace in your life
[1:02:53] and you've changed from what you were to
[1:02:55] what you know you will be you are no
[1:02:58] longer living alone the life under the
[1:03:01] law cannot be a law of freedom it is the
[1:03:04] law of bondage but he came to set us
[1:03:06] free and free indeed every one of us
[1:03:11] not one
[1:03:12] above another every one of us to have
[1:03:15] freedom right brother random talks about
[1:03:17] the law having a shadow of things to
[1:03:19] come he said could never make the
[1:03:21] worshiper he said the law having a
[1:03:23] shadow of things to come could never
[1:03:24] make the worshiper perfect
[1:03:26] he said now let's go he said let's go
[1:03:29] again he said you'll be sure not to miss
[1:03:31] this he said God requires perfect
[1:03:34] holiness
[1:03:35] no one can stand in His image with one
[1:03:38] little speck of sin he said Jesus
[1:03:42] Witnesses the same thing and said be
[1:03:44] perfect just like God in heaven is
[1:03:46] perfect and the Bible said the law could
[1:03:48] never with its sacrifices make the comer
[1:03:51] perfect he said then the law could not
[1:03:53] perfect anything it was only a pointer
[1:03:55] to the sacrifices made every year could
[1:03:58] never make the worship perfect so
[1:03:59] therefore no one under the law or
[1:04:01] keeping the laws or under the shadows
[1:04:03] could be perfect
[1:04:05] so all these worshipers year in year out
[1:04:07] could never be made perfect they had to
[1:04:10] do something they had to do something
[1:04:11] themselves they had to feel the pain
[1:04:14] they had to see the lamb die every one
[1:04:16] of them had to do this year in year out
[1:04:19] and it never changed their life
[1:04:21] it only gave them permission to go
[1:04:23] another year
[1:04:24] we're just going to live another year
[1:04:26] that's all they had this is just a
[1:04:28] license for another year it's like
[1:04:30] having to have it's like paying your
[1:04:31] taxes
[1:04:32] right yeah it's permission to live on
[1:04:35] your property another year
[1:04:36] you know that's what it is it's living
[1:04:38] under the law in this U.S that we live
[1:04:40] in we live under laws we are a nation of
[1:04:41] laws we're supposed to be we live in a
[1:04:44] nation of laws so if you break the law
[1:04:45] you live in bondage you live in prison
[1:04:47] you you don't get to be free that's just
[1:04:50] the way it is in this country we live in
[1:04:52] it is a nation of laws and as a a
[1:04:54] Christian many Christians still live
[1:04:57] under that you'll see some that they
[1:04:59] have to do a and I'm not pointing
[1:05:01] fingers at any certain group because I'm
[1:05:02] sure they mean well but some maybe have
[1:05:05] to have to still do the passovers and
[1:05:07] they still have to celebrate the this
[1:05:09] time of year you'll hear of lit
[1:05:11] uh things like that I mean that that's
[1:05:12] fine I mean if you want to give up
[1:05:14] something that's wonderful I should too
[1:05:16] I'm sure but but think about it if
[1:05:20] you're doing that trying to make
[1:05:21] yourself perfect it's all in vain
[1:05:24] because you're saying that the sacrifice
[1:05:26] that came wasn't perfect enough
[1:05:29] I gotta do something myself
[1:05:32] nothing you could do can perfect you
[1:05:35] not one single thing I believe in going
[1:05:38] to church I believe in paying tithes I
[1:05:40] believe in doing all these things but
[1:05:42] that is not going to perfect you
[1:05:44] not at all right you can come here every
[1:05:46] service and you can still be a sinner if
[1:05:49] you haven't accepted the ultimate
[1:05:51] sacrifice
[1:05:53] he said that brother Branham said is
[1:05:56] there if there if there is anything that
[1:05:59] I can do to make myself perfect in the
[1:06:01] presence of God then Christ did not have
[1:06:03] to die for me
[1:06:05] if there is one thing that you can do
[1:06:07] that would marry anything think about
[1:06:10] anything in the presence of God then
[1:06:12] Christ died in vain no law keeping
[1:06:15] listen to this no legalistic ideas of
[1:06:19] yours
[1:06:20] none of your own holiness
[1:06:23] no things that you could quit doing
[1:06:26] quit lying quit stealing quit smoking
[1:06:29] tobacco quit going to the picture shows
[1:06:30] still you're lost
[1:06:33] think about it nothing can change it
[1:06:36] I didn't talk about the picture shows
[1:06:38] brother Brandon did don't look at me
[1:06:39] like that
[1:06:41] she won't I guess but listen
[1:06:44] those those things you say well
[1:06:48] okay is it in what what's your heart
[1:06:50] look like
[1:06:51] I don't I don't go uh I don't smoke
[1:06:54] well are you condemning those who do
[1:06:56] maybe maybe try reaching out to them
[1:06:57] maybe try to help them you know yeah
[1:07:00] it's wrong let them know it's wrong if
[1:07:01] you need to but don't don't condemn The
[1:07:03] Sinner because you are the same way if
[1:07:05] you haven't accepted the sacrifice just
[1:07:07] because you know you don't have long
[1:07:09] hair you men don't have long hair and
[1:07:11] and you don't smoke that doesn't make
[1:07:13] you any better if you haven't accepted
[1:07:15] his sacrifice
[1:07:17] because nothing you can do
[1:07:19] can change who you really were nothing
[1:07:24] and the Bible brother says here he said
[1:07:26] and he goes on about lost my spot he
[1:07:28] said anything he said you are lost
[1:07:31] not one thing can do can you do in
[1:07:33] yourself for you are a sinner under
[1:07:35] condemnation there is not no way within
[1:07:38] yourself no Creed nothing that you could
[1:07:41] do or think of of yourself that could
[1:07:45] Merit one thing in the presence of God
[1:07:46] because you are a sinner to start with
[1:07:50] I don't care how many tapes we listen to
[1:07:52] right I encourage you to listen to tapes
[1:07:55] I listen to tapes I need to listen to
[1:07:57] more but that's not going to save me
[1:08:00] if that can replace salvation Jesus died
[1:08:03] in vain
[1:08:05] if gathering together at a certain time
[1:08:07] at a certain place
[1:08:09] can save me
[1:08:10] then we all went astray from the
[1:08:13] ultimate sacrifice
[1:08:16] we've taken a substitute again just like
[1:08:19] they did then we've went right back to
[1:08:22] living under the law the same way that
[1:08:24] they were so every year we got to do
[1:08:26] this every week we got to do this we
[1:08:28] have to do this it's a bunch of laws and
[1:08:31] legal things we must do but I want to
[1:08:33] live in the grace Realms I want to live
[1:08:36] in a place to where it doesn't matter
[1:08:39] if I do fall I want to live for God
[1:08:41] because I love God not because I have to
[1:08:45] yes I failed I failed again because I'm
[1:08:48] human
[1:08:50] yes I'm uh you know in this flesh I find
[1:08:52] it every day and you will too as long as
[1:08:55] you're in it but God saw a way to make
[1:08:59] you perfect no matter how imperfect you
[1:09:02] feel you are perfect if you've accepted
[1:09:05] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:08] brother Brandon talks about
[1:09:10] he said in the presence of God he said
[1:09:12] the Archbishop born in this world was
[1:09:15] guilty as the lowest Barfly in the city
[1:09:18] one cannot atone for the other all right
[1:09:22] he said
[1:09:23] he took an innocent life of an animal a
[1:09:25] little lamb into the Old Testament laws
[1:09:27] when a man sinned and he goes on and he
[1:09:28] talks about the lamb again this is the
[1:09:30] same sermon he talks about it he talks
[1:09:32] about the little lamb kicking and
[1:09:33] screaming and if you ever go listen to
[1:09:35] this this tape it's actually called
[1:09:37] Perfection I stole the title sorry and
[1:09:40] but uh but if I'm going to copy after
[1:09:43] somebody I guess it might as well be
[1:09:44] brother Brandon right so he uh he talks
[1:09:48] about this in the message Perfection I
[1:09:49] believe it's 1954 I have to look but
[1:09:51] it's late 50s mid to late 50s there he
[1:09:54] talks about and he dramatizes this so
[1:09:55] much if you think about it
[1:09:57] you could actually think about what that
[1:09:59] lamb went through and then you can think
[1:10:01] about what Jesus went through
[1:10:03] and when you start thinking about that
[1:10:06] when you start thinking about that
[1:10:08] just real soberly sometime get up in the
[1:10:10] morning and read the story of Jesus's
[1:10:12] crucifixion not to not to make you feel
[1:10:14] guilty
[1:10:15] to show you how much he loved you
[1:10:19] for God so loved the world we see that
[1:10:21] written on all the cars and all the
[1:10:22] signs in the Baptist churches and that's
[1:10:24] great
[1:10:25] but do they really understand the
[1:10:27] sacrifice
[1:10:28] it didn't come just so you could have a
[1:10:31] license to sin
[1:10:32] that's living under the law
[1:10:34] it didn't come so I can still smoke
[1:10:37] because God loves me anyway
[1:10:39] right that's living under the law
[1:10:41] see they have the law and Grace mixed up
[1:10:44] they think well I can live under grace
[1:10:45] so I can do what I want yes you can but
[1:10:48] if you live under grace you're not going
[1:10:50] to want to do those things anymore
[1:10:52] because see the lamb couldn't change
[1:10:54] what you wanted to do but this lamb
[1:10:57] could it could change who you wanted to
[1:11:00] be it could change you from wanting to
[1:11:03] be a sinner to wanting to be a saint it
[1:11:05] would actually take on this you would
[1:11:07] take on the same nature as the lamb
[1:11:10] because it was a blood sacrifice and the
[1:11:13] animal blood could not change you but a
[1:11:15] perfect blood of God could actually
[1:11:18] change your very uh the very way you act
[1:11:20] could change the the way you're the way
[1:11:23] you worship it can change the way that
[1:11:25] you treat people because you realize
[1:11:28] that you should have been there on the
[1:11:30] cross
[1:11:30] you should have been there that day you
[1:11:33] should have had to carry the crosstalk
[1:11:34] city and you should have had to take the
[1:11:36] beating that Jesus Took you should have
[1:11:38] wore those crowns you should have been
[1:11:40] the one but God saw fit to send his only
[1:11:43] son made in His image
[1:11:46] give him up so that you could sit here
[1:11:49] today and worship freely because you
[1:11:51] don't have to be under the law of sin no
[1:11:53] more we don't have to worry about what
[1:11:55] our ancestors did no more it don't
[1:11:57] matter if my dad was a Drucker it don't
[1:11:59] matter if if your mother was a
[1:12:01] prostitute it don't matter who your
[1:12:03] family tree is anymore because you have
[1:12:07] been changed by the blood of Jesus
[1:12:10] you say well I want to hear some deep
[1:12:12] Revelations there's one for you you get
[1:12:14] changed one time and it will lead you
[1:12:16] and guide you into all truth
[1:12:19] get under the blood and all the rest
[1:12:21] will come into Focus that's the way I
[1:12:23] believe it I believe if we ever get
[1:12:25] under the blood it takes you out from
[1:12:28] living under the law but see I heard a
[1:12:31] sermon one time and it was just
[1:12:32] wonderful it wasn't brother Branham but
[1:12:34] this brother had preached on the law
[1:12:37] versus Grace and he took it down through
[1:12:39] the Bible and and because you know you
[1:12:41] think of a person that wears a long
[1:12:42] skirt you know a lady that's wearing a
[1:12:44] long skirt and a long hair you think all
[1:12:46] that that's a legalist
[1:12:48] think about it we think that's legalist
[1:12:51] no legally
[1:12:53] you think well I've got to write because
[1:12:55] America will let me get away with
[1:12:57] wearing this
[1:12:59] I can do what I want because legally I
[1:13:01] can push the limits that's living under
[1:13:02] the law
[1:13:03] living under grace makes you want to
[1:13:05] dress like a lady
[1:13:08] see it's not something you have to do
[1:13:09] it's something you want to do
[1:13:12] a man the reason he doesn't go out here
[1:13:14] and get all tatted up and you know and
[1:13:16] and wear earrings and and look like some
[1:13:19] weird freak
[1:13:21] the reason he doesn't do that is because
[1:13:24] of the sacrifice and he's living under
[1:13:26] grace
[1:13:27] see we the world has twisted our minds
[1:13:30] to think that if you want to be free you
[1:13:32] got to act like the world they are still
[1:13:35] living under the law
[1:13:37] they have to go through the Judgment we
[1:13:39] don't have to go through the judgments
[1:13:42] we have already been judged by the lamb
[1:13:45] and he was perfect
[1:13:48] how can we go to hell if we've already
[1:13:51] been judged perfect before God
[1:13:55] think about it you can't be lost
[1:13:57] that's why I believe that if you've ever
[1:13:59] been saved you can't be lost so the
[1:14:00] Bible to say one saved always say but
[1:14:02] you can do what you want because you've
[1:14:03] been saved
[1:14:04] so you can smoke now because you've
[1:14:06] already been saved
[1:14:07] okay but if you were really saved
[1:14:10] the worshiper once purged has no more
[1:14:14] desire to what
[1:14:16] that's right the worshiper once purged
[1:14:20] has no more desire
[1:14:22] once
[1:14:25] not time not year after year
[1:14:27] I'm going to come back and and confess
[1:14:29] my sins this year and next year maybe
[1:14:31] every Easter
[1:14:33] um I'll make a new start I used to do
[1:14:35] that by the way I used to do that when I
[1:14:38] was a teenager
[1:14:39] 12 13 14 years old and I started seeking
[1:14:41] the Holy Ghost a little bit here and
[1:14:42] there every Youth Camp you know start
[1:14:44] feeling like I want to be like the other
[1:14:45] kids I you know we didn't go to message
[1:14:47] youth camps we went to uh Church of God
[1:14:49] Holiness Youth Camp so it wasn't called
[1:14:51] the Holy Ghost there forget the term now
[1:14:53] but anyway we would seek what they had
[1:14:54] what they wanted us to get right he
[1:14:57] always wanted to be like who you was
[1:14:58] around you and nobody nobody else just
[1:15:00] me okay
[1:15:01] we always wanted to be like whoever we
[1:15:03] were as around you know the best
[1:15:04] preacher you wanted to hang out with
[1:15:06] them the best singers you wanted to sing
[1:15:07] with them and uh you know best musicians
[1:15:10] you wanted to go stay in here then but
[1:15:11] you wanted to sneak out while the other
[1:15:12] ones were saying that's just the way you
[1:15:14] know I was that way maybe I was carnal
[1:15:15] I'm sure I was wasn't even saved yet as
[1:15:18] far as I know but
[1:15:19] there came a time every year around
[1:15:21] Easter I would always get to feeling bad
[1:15:24] I always felt lost anybody ever felt
[1:15:27] that way
[1:15:28] you get you go to church and you feel
[1:15:29] condemned every time
[1:15:32] we would go to a meeting at Labor Day
[1:15:33] meetings every year and I usually would
[1:15:35] have an experience around Easter and it
[1:15:37] didn't hold me very long it hold me for
[1:15:38] a month or two
[1:15:40] and then I'd go to these meetings around
[1:15:41] Labor Day and I would always feel guilty
[1:15:43] because if I heard anything about what I
[1:15:45] was doing I thought oh I'm going to hell
[1:15:48] I had no understanding
[1:15:50] that if I ever really got saved
[1:15:52] that yes I may have failed I made a
[1:15:54] mistake
[1:15:55] but I wasn't lost
[1:15:58] I was still living in my mind I was
[1:15:59] living under the law was it a lack of
[1:16:01] teaching I don't know what it was was in
[1:16:03] my mind I had never had it settled with
[1:16:05] God
[1:16:06] that what he did once was enough for me
[1:16:10] what he did once would hold me not just
[1:16:12] to the next Revival not just to the next
[1:16:15] Youth Camp not just to the next good
[1:16:17] service but it would hold me until the
[1:16:20] day of my Redemption
[1:16:22] you talk about a Salvation it'll change
[1:16:25] you from the thinking that you have
[1:16:27] right it'll change you from who you were
[1:16:31] it'll make you different
[1:16:34] yeah and brother Brandon was talking
[1:16:35] about he goes on about this
[1:16:37] about the the worshiper
[1:16:39] he said the blood made a covering
[1:16:42] but it could not perfectly atone for the
[1:16:44] man
[1:16:45] left the building with the same desire
[1:16:46] he says that twice
[1:16:48] the same desire to sin as he had in the
[1:16:50] first place
[1:16:52] brother Brandon goes on down and he says
[1:16:54] he predestinated a church to meet him
[1:16:56] Yonder
[1:16:58] without spot or wrinkle
[1:17:02] now listen to this
[1:17:03] if God requires a church
[1:17:07] without spot or wrinkle
[1:17:09] he had to have something to make it that
[1:17:12] way I love that I love it if he requires
[1:17:16] a church
[1:17:17] to be holy
[1:17:19] that he has to provide a way for you to
[1:17:21] be holy
[1:17:22] If he if he has something in his mind of
[1:17:26] of a bride that is going to be coming
[1:17:28] and we are going to be The Virtuous a
[1:17:30] virtuous spotless
[1:17:32] sinless
[1:17:33] bride of Jesus Christ there has to be a
[1:17:37] way to attain that level of perfection
[1:17:40] but see
[1:17:42] don't ever think you can achieve it in
[1:17:44] the flesh
[1:17:45] because you'll fight that battle every
[1:17:47] day
[1:17:48] every single day every single time you
[1:17:52] come to church I'm not good enough to be
[1:17:54] here I'm not good enough to worship I
[1:17:57] can't sing I can't raise my hands I
[1:17:59] can't be free why because you're living
[1:18:01] under the law
[1:18:03] but if you just come out from under that
[1:18:05] for a minute
[1:18:06] and look to Calvary that should have
[1:18:09] been you but he did it once for you and
[1:18:12] because he did it once that worshiper
[1:18:16] now you the worshiper me the worshiper
[1:18:19] because he died you could be alive and a
[1:18:22] living worshiper clean and spotless
[1:18:25] before God because remember when God
[1:18:27] looks at the blood he never sees one sin
[1:18:31] you ever did
[1:18:33] think about it he can see everything he
[1:18:35] knows everything and he can't see your
[1:18:37] sin
[1:18:39] I remember brother Brandon might have
[1:18:41] said this or maybe it was a testimony I
[1:18:43] have I don't have it in front of me
[1:18:45] but he had said something about don't
[1:18:47] come in the prayer line brother Braham
[1:18:48] talks about don't come in the prayer
[1:18:49] line with unconfessed sins you've heard
[1:18:51] him say that
[1:18:52] he said don't come in the prayer lines
[1:18:54] with unconfessed sins because he said he
[1:18:56] said the holy spirit will pick that up
[1:18:59] and of course you don't want him
[1:19:00] standing there in front of a microphone
[1:19:01] telling the whole world what you did
[1:19:04] what's I mean that you know some some
[1:19:06] may have had big sins little sins they
[1:19:07] were all Sinners just get that let's get
[1:19:09] that out there too right it doesn't
[1:19:11] matter how big or little your sin was
[1:19:13] if it was sin it was sin and you did it
[1:19:15] because you really didn't believe in the
[1:19:17] atonement all sin is unbelief brother
[1:19:19] Branham said because you don't really
[1:19:20] believe in
[1:19:21] the fact that he died for you you've
[1:19:23] doubted a little bit or maybe your flesh
[1:19:25] made you doubt a little bit maybe you
[1:19:27] got down and out and you doubted a
[1:19:28] little bit maybe you sinned
[1:19:30] but all you have to do is and it's so
[1:19:33] simple that maybe it sounds a little bit
[1:19:34] like Baptist Doctrine
[1:19:36] but it's not it's actually Bible and
[1:19:38] message
[1:19:39] brother Brandon said all you have to do
[1:19:41] is repent
[1:19:44] that's it
[1:19:45] you don't have to wait for the clouds to
[1:19:47] open
[1:19:48] you don't have to wait for a great big
[1:19:50] listen don't take this wrong I believe
[1:19:52] in shouting I believe in running I
[1:19:54] believe in all those things if the Lord
[1:19:55] moves you to do that but you don't have
[1:19:57] to wait for that
[1:19:59] well I didn't run yet I haven't shouted
[1:20:02] I haven't spoke with tongue so I must
[1:20:04] not have been forgiven that's the devil
[1:20:06] telling you that
[1:20:07] that's the devil telling you well you're
[1:20:09] you're not really spiritual enough to be
[1:20:11] forgiven I don't care how spiritually
[1:20:13] you are if you've accepted the blood
[1:20:16] I've repented in my sins
[1:20:18] I've accepted the blood of Christ I am
[1:20:21] therefore clean anybody that accuses me
[1:20:24] now that's on them
[1:20:27] if I've made it right between me and God
[1:20:29] and I've went maybe to the people I've
[1:20:31] hurt and you do have to sometimes go to
[1:20:33] people because you hurt people you have
[1:20:34] to do that it's good to confess and and
[1:20:37] you know confess your wrongs that's it's
[1:20:39] hard to do but it needs to be done
[1:20:41] sometimes right but I will say this
[1:20:45] you once you get the channel clear
[1:20:46] between you and God I don't care if you
[1:20:48] have an emotional experience or not
[1:20:51] it's settled right then
[1:20:53] I don't care if you shout
[1:20:55] you may sit there just like you've said
[1:20:57] every service but think about it if your
[1:21:00] heart is clear before God there is
[1:21:02] therefore now
[1:21:04] no condemnation
[1:21:06] because you're not walking after the
[1:21:08] flesh anymore but you're walking after
[1:21:09] the spirit
[1:21:11] I'm thankful for that
[1:21:13] brother Bram tells the story
[1:21:15] I don't have time to to tell the I've
[1:21:18] got so many now I told you Stuart I had
[1:21:19] a bunch I really do I got way too much
[1:21:22] I'll just go way down here I'm gonna go
[1:21:24] way down here I'm about out of time I
[1:21:25] got seven minutes left
[1:21:27] and it may be over time brother Brown
[1:21:29] tells a story I'm not going to read it
[1:21:30] for safe to save time
[1:21:32] brother Brandon is is in Ohio I believe
[1:21:34] and I've got it on here but I just won't
[1:21:36] read it I'll just go through the streets
[1:21:38] in Ohio and he was actually eating he's
[1:21:40] holding some meetings so he would
[1:21:41] usually go to This Little Dutch
[1:21:43] restaurant where he had such nice
[1:21:44] waitresses and so forth but they were
[1:21:45] closed on Sunday so he went down to this
[1:21:47] other little restaurant you've heard the
[1:21:49] story so you know where I'm going with
[1:21:50] this
[1:21:51] brother Brandon Walks in there and
[1:21:54] right and uh he looks in there and he
[1:21:56] sees this woman I believe he said she
[1:21:57] had purple fingernails
[1:21:59] purple toenails
[1:22:01] short hair dyed blue I think is what he
[1:22:03] says yeah
[1:22:05] I mean this this is this is a real
[1:22:07] picture of modern America right but this
[1:22:09] is back in the 50s
[1:22:11] and uh and so he's talking about this
[1:22:13] woman you know he said she's sitting in
[1:22:15] the booth and she's got the two men
[1:22:16] sitting there with her and he said
[1:22:17] they're drunk one of them he said it's
[1:22:19] middle of summer and one of them's
[1:22:20] wearing a big old army coat
[1:22:22] he said he looked in there and in his
[1:22:23] heart he condemned him
[1:22:25] you know we do that too I mean it's kind
[1:22:28] of the human nature
[1:22:30] you say well I'm better than the prophet
[1:22:31] I don't condemn nobody well I'm not
[1:22:33] a lot of times we'll look at the bum
[1:22:35] walking down and we we condemn them
[1:22:37] should we do that no but we do it's a
[1:22:39] human part of it coming out
[1:22:41] but
[1:22:42] brother Brandon looks in there and he
[1:22:43] said the Holy Spirit I believe this is
[1:22:45] how he says it I could be wrong you can
[1:22:46] go back and listen to it
[1:22:47] kind of pulled him back behind the door
[1:22:51] and he showed him
[1:22:52] a view of the world and around the world
[1:22:54] was
[1:22:55] a crimson
[1:22:57] red around the world
[1:23:00] and then he showed him his own sins
[1:23:03] think about it here's a prophet
[1:23:06] who
[1:23:08] didn't drink
[1:23:09] didn't smoke
[1:23:11] the Lord told him not to defile his body
[1:23:13] in any way
[1:23:14] this guy this guy is pretty Perfect by
[1:23:16] our standards
[1:23:18] but he knew he was a sinner
[1:23:20] and God showed him he said the sins that
[1:23:22] I did as a child
[1:23:24] think about it God ever bring back to
[1:23:26] you remembered sometimes you condemn
[1:23:27] somebody and you start thinking man I
[1:23:29] I've been pretty bad myself
[1:23:32] I've done some pretty stupid stuff in my
[1:23:34] life
[1:23:35] you know brother Harold we've all done
[1:23:37] some crazy stuff right
[1:23:38] and so
[1:23:40] God had showed brother Branham his own
[1:23:43] sins so now you're going to watch a
[1:23:45] prophet standing there first condemning
[1:23:47] and then the Holy Spirit deals with him
[1:23:50] the way he does with us too it's not
[1:23:51] just for the prophet it's for you too
[1:23:54] the holy spirit's dealing with him
[1:23:56] showing him his own sins and then he
[1:23:58] shows him that the whole world would be
[1:24:00] destroyed
[1:24:02] if it was not for
[1:24:04] this Blood
[1:24:06] that wrapped around the whole entire
[1:24:08] world
[1:24:10] think about it
[1:24:12] and brother Brandon said it was like a
[1:24:14] bumper on a car
[1:24:17] he said and that blood acted as that
[1:24:19] bumper
[1:24:20] he said
[1:24:21] then the next thing it moved to
[1:24:23] compassion
[1:24:26] and so brother Branham actually goes in
[1:24:27] and he talks to the woman
[1:24:30] you know the story he talks to the woman
[1:24:32] and he tells her
[1:24:34] I first off she says oh sit down you
[1:24:37] know
[1:24:38] and I guess the two guys get up and
[1:24:39] leave and so he
[1:24:41] he starts talking to her
[1:24:43] and he comes to find out this woman had
[1:24:45] I believe she'd either been a Sunday
[1:24:46] school teacher or her parents had been
[1:24:48] in church and at one point in life she'd
[1:24:50] been a pretty good pretty good girl
[1:24:53] and here she was in this condition
[1:24:55] see this is what happens when you live
[1:24:57] under the law
[1:24:58] you can just never get ahead
[1:25:01] you can never if you're under the law
[1:25:03] you're condemned for the rest of your
[1:25:05] life
[1:25:06] because there's no way out
[1:25:08] or so you think
[1:25:11] and so brother Brandon starts talking to
[1:25:12] her
[1:25:13] and then she didn't know who he was and
[1:25:15] then she realizes something she says oh
[1:25:18] are you Mr Branham or Reverend Branham
[1:25:20] one of the whatever how she however
[1:25:21] she's called him
[1:25:23] he said yes ma'am and she said oh I'm
[1:25:25] ashamed of myself
[1:25:27] now this woman had gotten the presence
[1:25:29] of God now not calling brother Branham
[1:25:30] God but the spirit of God was there
[1:25:33] no doubt he had felt led to walk over
[1:25:35] there by the spirit of God
[1:25:37] and now he's standing there talking to
[1:25:38] this woman and she started feeling
[1:25:39] ashamed and started testifying or
[1:25:41] telling telling him her past and how
[1:25:44] guilty she was that's what a sinner will
[1:25:45] do they'll tell you how bad they've been
[1:25:47] there well I can't go to church because
[1:25:48] they judge me you know because they want
[1:25:49] me to act like them and I can't live
[1:25:51] like that well no you can't
[1:25:54] not not on your own
[1:25:57] and brothers talking to this woman and
[1:25:58] the next thing you know
[1:26:00] he said word he said she's down on her
[1:26:03] knees and he said we're down there
[1:26:04] praying and he said he said she's now
[1:26:06] serving the lord today
[1:26:07] but I want you to notice one thing about
[1:26:09] the story
[1:26:11] it goes from a man walking in seeing the
[1:26:14] condition of the sinner
[1:26:17] and immediately
[1:26:18] he's looking at her
[1:26:20] with the with with eyes of of
[1:26:22] condemnation
[1:26:24] and then once the Holy Spirit comes upon
[1:26:27] him
[1:26:29] he doesn't look at her anymore
[1:26:31] through condemnation but it's a sinner
[1:26:34] that could come back to God
[1:26:37] we were in the same boat
[1:26:40] we were sitting there and God was
[1:26:42] looking at you
[1:26:44] and he said I can't stand your sin I
[1:26:47] can't stand to see a sinner in my sight
[1:26:49] you cannot stand in my presence and be
[1:26:52] that filthy human being that you are
[1:26:55] and then all of a sudden Jesus stood up
[1:26:59] and he steps in between the sinner
[1:27:02] and the prosecutor
[1:27:05] and God no longer sees the sinner
[1:27:09] but he sees the perfect
[1:27:12] sinless spotless blood of Jesus Christ
[1:27:17] he can no longer see your sin tonight I
[1:27:21] want you to think about what happened
[1:27:22] that day on Calvary it changed your
[1:27:25] Eternal destination it changed who you
[1:27:27] are it changed where you were going you
[1:27:31] were everyone I was going to a sinner's
[1:27:34] grave and going straight to hell but God
[1:27:36] rich in Mercy he sent his very own son
[1:27:39] he said you don't deserve this but he
[1:27:42] said I'm going to give you the very best
[1:27:44] the lamb won't work forever but here is
[1:27:47] perfection so that you too can be
[1:27:50] perfected oh I think somebody ought to
[1:27:53] get excited about that right now you
[1:27:55] couldn't be perfect but now he can't see
[1:27:58] you no more he's looking at you Brother
[1:28:00] David he doesn't see your family history
[1:28:03] he doesn't see who you were but he sees
[1:28:06] God in you he says I can see you you are
[1:28:09] now expressions of Christ
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:14] when I saw this
[1:28:15] I got to thank him my goodness he can't
[1:28:18] even see me
[1:28:20] he don't even see what I've been
[1:28:23] he can't even see me as a human anymore
[1:28:27] he can't see I I failed oh I failed God
[1:28:30] I feel so miserable why he can't see it
[1:28:33] no more if you'll confess it to God he
[1:28:37] is faithful and just to forgive you
[1:28:39] those Sins not because he wants to but
[1:28:42] because he loved you so much that he has
[1:28:45] already sent a perfect sacrifice
[1:28:49] not something you have to do every year
[1:28:51] not something you have to do every time
[1:28:53] you feel bad
[1:28:54] now something just during the Easter
[1:28:56] season
[1:28:57] I enjoy reflecting on these things
[1:28:59] during Easter sometimes it'll bring me
[1:29:01] back a little bit
[1:29:02] kind of focus me you know sometimes you
[1:29:04] have to think a little more serious
[1:29:06] about things
[1:29:07] when it comes to your family when it
[1:29:09] comes to your life and what have you
[1:29:10] been doing what do you you know how have
[1:29:12] you been living sometimes you have to
[1:29:13] step back
[1:29:15] look at what he did for you
[1:29:17] but don't feel condemned because of what
[1:29:20] you did
[1:29:22] you can't change that but he can
[1:29:25] you can't change who you were
[1:29:28] you can't change the mistakes you made
[1:29:29] yesterday you can't change the mistakes
[1:29:31] you made today
[1:29:34] but if you've confessed them to God
[1:29:37] he can't see him no more
[1:29:40] just in closing you've heard the old
[1:29:41] story musicians go ahead and come you've
[1:29:43] heard the story about the man that was
[1:29:45] in his the old man in his house and and
[1:29:47] uh
[1:29:48] I believe it was his daughter was going
[1:29:51] to have a tea party or something
[1:29:52] and uh and so he said she said go
[1:29:55] upstairs or something you know and
[1:29:56] didn't want to give him his Bible
[1:29:57] because
[1:29:58] he'd shout when he got to reading the
[1:30:00] word of God and how he saw you know the
[1:30:02] blood was covering his sins and all
[1:30:03] these things and so she gave him a book
[1:30:05] of maybe it was geography or something
[1:30:06] you know I don't I didn't go to school I
[1:30:08] don't know what it was about but put him
[1:30:10] up in the attic and she put him up there
[1:30:12] in the Attic where he wouldn't make no
[1:30:13] noise and then he got to reading this
[1:30:14] book and the next thing you know they're
[1:30:15] all sitting down there having their
[1:30:16] little tea party
[1:30:18] and he starts shouting think about it
[1:30:21] over a geography book
[1:30:24] because in there he saw
[1:30:26] that there was a place in the sea where
[1:30:28] there was no bottom they couldn't find
[1:30:30] the bottom of it right and then he
[1:30:32] remembered
[1:30:33] that's where my sins are
[1:30:36] God can't even find them no more
[1:30:40] because I am not able
[1:30:43] to make it on my own
[1:30:45] but God who is rich in Mercy became a
[1:30:48] man
[1:30:49] so that I could become one with God
[1:30:51] himself
[1:30:52] and when he sees me amen he no longer
[1:30:55] sees Joel Pruitt
[1:30:58] he no longer sees Bill Curtis
[1:31:01] he no longer sees Isaac he don't see any
[1:31:04] of you like that anymore
[1:31:06] you're just a sinner saved by grace
[1:31:08] you're just a sinner
[1:31:10] every one of us we're just sinners
[1:31:12] so I tried to point fingers because if I
[1:31:13] do I'm pointing back at myself too
[1:31:15] I'm just a sinner in the eyes of a just
[1:31:19] God
[1:31:20] but in the eyes of him now that I've
[1:31:23] accepted the blood
[1:31:24] he sees nothing
[1:31:27] nothing because brother Brandon said
[1:31:30] he said here we are
[1:31:32] red like sin red red is a sign of sin so
[1:31:37] he says you have red over here that sin
[1:31:39] he said and then you have a just God
[1:31:42] over here and he says what happened was
[1:31:44] he said that red blood come down between
[1:31:46] you and God
[1:31:47] he said in red through red
[1:31:50] so the red over here you
[1:31:52] threw that red blood looks White
[1:31:56] so you're still the same old red blooded
[1:31:59] sinner you ever were your blood has no
[1:32:02] salvation in it
[1:32:03] right but there is a sacrifice that's
[1:32:06] been made
[1:32:07] and because of that
[1:32:09] Brothers we don't have to take a back
[1:32:11] seat to nobody
[1:32:13] you're going to fall again and again
[1:32:16] but a Christian that's accepted the
[1:32:18] atonement they'll get back up and keep
[1:32:20] going
[1:32:21] that's what that's the difference
[1:32:23] living under that law
[1:32:24] you had to do that every year think
[1:32:26] about it you had to live for 12 months
[1:32:30] before you killed your next lamb and you
[1:32:32] had to feel that condemnation all year
[1:32:33] long
[1:32:34] don't be that way don't say well there's
[1:32:37] a meeting coming up in July
[1:32:39] and I'm going to get a refilling of the
[1:32:41] Holy Ghost
[1:32:42] I'm gonna I'm gonna be a better
[1:32:44] Christian after those meetings
[1:32:45] don't wait
[1:32:48] if you feel guilty about something just
[1:32:49] confess it to God and right then and
[1:32:51] there it's settled I don't care if it's
[1:32:54] a church I don't care if it's in your
[1:32:56] home I don't care if it's in your car
[1:32:58] driving wherever it is settle it between
[1:33:00] you and God there and just let that
[1:33:03] thing go and you can live happy and
[1:33:06] rejoicing all the days of your life
[1:33:07] because sin is no longer sitting there
[1:33:10] telling you you can't go to heaven
[1:33:12] because you're no good well you know
[1:33:15] that's right
[1:33:16] you're no good I'm no good but devil
[1:33:19] you're looking at me
[1:33:21] but you ought to see the sacrifice
[1:33:23] that's been made for me and he went down
[1:33:26] into hell and he took those book Cutters
[1:33:29] and he cut the locks off us off of all
[1:33:32] those bars that were holding us back and
[1:33:34] he and he said you know what you can be
[1:33:36] free and devil might have tried to put
[1:33:38] you into that jail cell but remember we
[1:33:41] got a pretty good lawyer
[1:33:42] and he's going to set you free why
[1:33:45] because he always wins every case he
[1:33:48] never lets anybody go to prison he
[1:33:50] always brings you out puts you over here
[1:33:53] and says you know what you're free
[1:33:54] you're not even on probation you're on
[1:33:57] free moral agency do whatever you want
[1:33:59] because you know you love me you aren't
[1:34:02] going to go out and just willfully sin
[1:34:04] the center once purged has no more
[1:34:06] desire
[1:34:07] and that's what I want to be tonight I
[1:34:10] know that's what you want to be I'm over
[1:34:11] time I apologize let's stay under our
[1:34:12] feet he became me can we do that one
[1:34:17] what you're thankful he became us
[1:34:20] so that we could become
[1:34:22] same
[1:34:24] as Jesus
[1:34:26] you think think about this just for a
[1:34:28] second
[1:34:29] he's looking down at you
[1:34:31] and instead of seeing a bunch of sinners
[1:34:35] yes he knows every detail of your life
[1:34:37] but he doesn't see the sin anymore
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:40] he's looking down at the center
[1:34:43] and all he sees
[1:34:45] is the living body
