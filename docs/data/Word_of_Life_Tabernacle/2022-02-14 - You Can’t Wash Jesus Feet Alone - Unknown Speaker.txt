TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] harold's daughter tish she's had surgery today and and they said it went well so keep remembering her in your prayers heavenly father we love you today and we thank you for your great love that you had for us lord that you showed in so many ways and even displayed it again today lord in our lives i'm so grateful lord to be even standing here today lord i i don't know what i could have ever done to deserve your your attention lord but you chose me and you chose us lord as your people before the foundation of the world then you put something in us that would respond and you overwhelmed us by your love until we just had to say back lord i love you i feel that overwhelming love tonight lord may you just make it real to us lord and just speak to every heart lord as we go into this communion service communion is about the love that you had for us that you went to a cross lord for our sins so that we could be clean so that we could go live in heaven with you we thank you for that lord i pray that you bless each one heal these that are sick and those that are in need we believe that you're still jehovah jireh or you can provide to the preaching of the word and the ministry or to the laying on of hands through prayer through praise you can provide exactly what we have need of tonight ask these things in your precious name amen hallelujah amen turn with me if you would to john chapter 13. john chapter 13 and verse 1. i want to thank our musicians tonight they do such a wonderful job we always miss all of them when they're not here and we've had a just a wonderful time uh today i have with the music and the worship you just all keep on worshiping and believing we may not be the loudest church in the world but i believe the holy spirit is here and you just respond to that and i'm sure that he'll bless you in that john chapter 13 and verse one we'll read down through verse five i want to title this you can't wash jesus feet alone i may have approached this subject before in a little bit different way but i want to look at these things tonight before we take communion john chapter 13 verse 1 now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god think about this verse he had done he could do anything he wanted to do that's real headship he could do whatever he wanted to do and he chose he came from god he went you're going back to god and he got up laid aside his garments took a towel and girded himself when he could do anything he wanted to because he was god he chose to become a foot wash funky and wash the disciples feet after that he poureth water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded i pray the lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated there are some things that we are required to do as a body you can't wash jesus feet alone what i mean by that is there's at least two of you you can't wash jesus feet alone and when i talk about washing jesus feet i mean the feet of your brother and sister in christ which we are the body of christ and there's some things that again there we have to do as a body by necessity and and the way it was made you can't take communion alone now i understand that if a person was all by themselves and had no way to get to a church maybe there could be an exception made but this idea that someone can get a revelation and then you can have community in your home by yourself is it destroys the spirit of communion because we don't just come together to drink wine and eat unleavened bread we come together right we come together you can't do it like they did it without coming together and covet doesn't change that nothing else changes that i realized we we were careful others were careful i know of churches that went years i know the church that just had communion the first time the other day and they were so thankful to be able to do that three years of no communion and had never been able to have it as a body that that's that's hard because we were meant to do this together you can't do that alone and it's something especially the foot washing part has become lost among christians even in brother branham's day he received criticism for doing it only a very few churches do it today because by its nature it's humbling to wash someone's feet it's meant to be amen especially back then when people walked around in sandals and the roads were dirt roads we know it was practiced in the early church in first timothy 5 10 it speaks of widows that would be accepted in in the number in the sense that the church would support these types of widows if she of law has lodged strangers or is hospitable if she squashed the saints feet it was considered something that you would do if you were a real christian she would relieve the afflicted if she had diligently followed every good work but the branham when he speaks of hattie rights boys and you can go look it up but he talks about how that once they had come once they'd given their hearts to christ he noticed that they started washing feet with the men and he used that as evidence that they'd gotten something that they were saved and and so we know it meant something to him when the disciples in jesus came together there would have normally been someone there to wash the feet of the guest anytime you had a passover meal or a great meal like that you would have people there but this was a very special situation there was no foot wash flunky as brother random called them no no servant there to wash the feet because there was a threat on jesus life and it was a very secret occasion they had slipped in and and here it was just those that could be trusted and not really all of those could be trusted only those who could be trusted and so it's just a few people that gathered together for the what would become known as the last supper we know that they were all arguing about who was the greatest before dinner they did not get the moment at all sometimes we don't sometimes we don't i wonder what we'll be doing the morning of the rapture think about it maybe just a day like any other day right but here they were arguing about who was the greatest and and which one would would sit at the right hand in the kingdom and all had all these carnal thoughts about what it would be all of them were unconverted they didn't know this was the last supper but jesus knew and he loved them the bible says to the end and as we said this morning love is is condescending it's it's it's you becoming something less in order to help someone else and so jesus loving them he he stepped down he come from the father he was going back to the father but he stepped out of his role as god as deity and stepped down to spend time with the disciples and to wash their feet i want you to notice they never washed his feet and i wonder sometimes if that wouldn't have been a a little bit of a hardship afterwards if you think about it if the disciples realized the opportunity that they had missed brother danny to have washed jesus feet here they were sitting there at the table arguing about who was going to betray jesus who was going to be this who was going to be the greatest in the kingdom all these things all the doctrines and things that they had argued about that they thought was important and they could have actually stepped out and washed jesus feet and they didn't we have no record in the scripture of any disciple ever washing jesus feet we have no record in the scripture of a pharisee ever washing jesus feet there was a prostitute one time she didn't recognize the importance of the occasion either but she knew there was a need so his feet had already been washed the disciples were too busy the pharisees were too busy but and they would regret that i'm sure later on many of them would but here they she was not too busy she she obeyed the command and went in to do a service for god because she saw that his feet weren't washed and it wasn't right for him to remain like that and brother branham took that to worship he said it's not right for him to remain in the church without his feet wash i don't care you call it emotionalism you call it sensation whatever you want to call it you can call me whatever you want to call me but it's not right for christ to be in the church and there no be no tears there'd be no shouts there'd be no amens there'd be no no movement it's not right for it not to be heartfelt are you with me tonight amen i want us to look around the room not this room that room look around see who's there it's maybe a little different tonight but you just bear with me peter was in the room peter was born in the village besetta at some point he and andrew moved to capernaum where they ran a business together it was originally named simon when jesus met him he called him peter it's funny after that whenever jesus rebuked him he called him simon go look it up every time jesus rebuked peter he called him simon simon what am i going to do with you sometimes we're simon sometimes we're peter he's the leader of the group he's in jesus inner circle he gets the most praise he also gets the hardest criticism he's brash outspoken promises things he can't deliver and is constantly in the middle of things he denies jesus three times and immediately repents he's ignorant and unlearned in fact in the book of acts they they call him that ignorant unlearned that literally means an illiterate ignoramus after pentecost he's a great preacher has a great public ministry even his shadow healed people but he was still prone to being swayed by public opinion because paul had to withstand him to the face but he didn't think to wash jesus feet andrew his brother was one of the first to follow jesus he was john's disciple i i like andrew he was always in the shadow of peter his more famous brother but without him peter would have never been saved i i this is kind of personal but i hope my brother my son my my children outshine me in some way go farther than i've gone don't have to have the scars that i have don't have to go through what i've been through i've been through some things and i hope that they go way farther than i went way much more anointed much more able to speak and things but i'll always i'll always have a part andrew always had a part because he was the one who introduced peter to jesus he was always introducing people to jesus we all had to be that way shouldn't we andrew was a personal worker he never preached a great campaign but he brought the greeks to jesus he brought the boy with the fish to jesus remember he's the one you know they're all talking so what are we going to do and here's a little boy that's got two loaves and five fishes and they're they're all wondering how we gonna fulfill the commands of jesus it's impossible for us to do and andrew said well i don't know how to do the math but i'll tell you this if we get this boy in the presence of jesus the mouth will change i wonder if we could ever think like that if we could get our children if we could get our young people if we could get our family or relatives in the presence of christ things would change there was james he and his brother john were called this were the sons of zebedee called the sons of thunder they ran a fishing business with their father they were more well-off than peter and andrew from a more prestigious family of levites the bible tells us and jesus is the one who called him a son of thunder when the samaritans didn't receive jesus they wanted to call down fire out of heaven and destroy them all jesus said you don't know what spirits you've got he should have been the most preeminent of the disciples but he and john tried to get their mother to set them up with thrones on either side of jesus i tell you what there was a lot of carnality going on i think it's bad in the church today go back right before pentecost the holy ghost took care of a lot of that amen but they were they were trying to get thrones on either side of jesus but he was always in the shadow of his brother john john was a great man in the scripture of all the disciples he was the most hot-headed impatient fervent saw things in black and white you can see that in his letters you don't have a gray area he's a bit of a legalist but he becomes the apostle of love well it's amazing how life can change people we read this morning that came from john john was the hot head same guy that wanted to call fire down out of heaven brother jt at the end of his life he just got up in the pulpit and all he could say is little children love one another same guy he has the most lasting impact probably of all the disciples because he wrote the book of revelation he suffered for the kingdom jesus told him are you able to drink of the cup that i drink of he calls himself the disciple that jesus loved he later wrote the book of revelation but in the upper room with jesus at that time he's still young a hothead a son of thunder he didn't think to wash jesus feet thought never crossed his mind they would never take that job philip was the hair philip from bessetta also where they were from most of these disciples were from the same area in fact everybody but judas was galilean judas was the higher class he was from judah philip is a campaign manager of sorts for jesus he's a in charge of logistics in the meetings he's the one who who figures out the math and says there's not enough bread to feed the people till andrew got the little kid to jesus he has trouble understanding the godhead and some people have trouble understanding the godhead today it's lack of the holy ghost i think in some cases because philip before he got the holy ghost he said lord show us the father and jesus said have i been so long time with you and you've not known me that was philip that he didn't think to wash jesus feet there was nathaniel called bartholomew nathanael was found by philip he's from cana of galilee he was an expectation of the messiah because of the scriptures he was a good man jesus called him a man in whom is no guile that's a good man he recognizes the sign of the son of man immediately and and he's brought to christ thomas was there we know thomas is a doubter but he was still a disciple i think thomas's problem wasn't so much doubt as pessimism well this is different tonight isn't it yeah i think his problem was pessimistic if you ever look at where he said in in in john uh 11 6 in john 11 6 i didn't give them the scriptures or anything tonight it's kind of off the cuff and you just just try to follow me but thomas which is called didymus that means twin he said to his fellow disciples because they didn't understand what jesus was talking about and so this is uh john 11 16 i'm sorry john 11 16 and and he jesus is talking about going and dying it's it's actually a pretty uh pretty somber message at the time jesus is trying to get him to understand i'm going to go die i i'm going to give my life and thomas is a little bit of a pessimist he said let's go also let us also go then we may die with him he says we might as well we're all going to die i know some people like that john 14 and 5 thomas tells jesus lord we don't know where you go how can we know the way he does have a problem with doubt in john 20 and 25 he here jesus has appeared to the disciples and the other disciples said to him we have seen the lord and he just happened to miss that sunday service but he said i i won't believe it unless i see the in his hands the print of the nails put my finger into the print of the nails thrust my hand into his side but jesus could have said well i don't want him but jesus knew he would doubt and so he appeared that morning too aren't you glad he shows up what's he doing showing his love in his many places amen he chose it over and over again and when thomas doubted the first son he didn't show up and doubted that the good service actually happened here here he come the next service he showed up again aren't you glad he shows up again he showed up again and and and and he still doubted him but when he showed up he said lord i believe and jesus said is better for those who have not seen and yet believed to be one of those but he was still jesus disciple but he didn't think to wash jesus feet matthew the publican is there also known as levi he writes the gospel of matthew and in the gospel of matthew he does an admirable thing he keeps himself almost completely out of the picture i'll be honest with you if i had written the gospel of matthew matthew would have been all in it i kind of like the way john did it because john kind of did it underhanded he calls himself the disciple jesus loved and kind of puts that in there you know on occasion these were human beings and matthew he he doesn't hardly mention matthew at all he probably had a pretty low opinion of himself because he was a publican that's basically the mafia in that day they were traitors they were on the same social level as harlots he would have been forbidden entrance to the synagogue he probably had never been to the church when jesus called him and so he was called but he made jesus a great meal in his own house and that's when jesus got in trouble for sitting with publicans there was james the son of alpheus or james the less i don't know about you but i'd have a problem being called james the less and the reason why he was called james the less is because he was not james the brother of jesus and james the brother of jesus was so well respected in that time so they called him james the less i hope it was because he was smaller and not because they thought of him less we don't really know anything about him but you know there's got to be a place for james the less huh he's just one of the 12. we don't even know what he did but he's there he was needed sure right james the less was needed you're needed we need each and every one of you god needs each and every one of you you may think of yourself as little these little ones sitting on the front row taking notes they may think of themselves as little but god knows each and every one of them he knows you're here and he knows why you're here today we don't know about james the less but james celeste was one of the disciples he didn't wash jesus feet you'd have thought he could have stooped down being james the less but jesus washed his feet it was jude also known as levi estadius or judas his name meant tenderhearted sweet he's the one that said lord how is it that that won't manifest thyself unto us not into the world and jesus said if a man loved me he would keep my words my father will love him we will come to him and make our abode with him i'm trying to hurry through this tonight so we can get to our communion there was simon the zealot he was a member of an outlaw political sect named the zealots he was basically a terrorist god can call just about anybody to be a preacher can he he would have carried a curved knife that's why they call him that that's what that means simon the zealot he would have carried a curved knife and they carried that and just in case they come across a collaborator with the romans they'd knife him in the back he was sworn to kill people like matthew early church was interesting man he spent his whole life you imagine him calling two disciples like that here's one who's a tax collector here's another one sworn to kill tax collectors he calls them both they're sitting at the last supper sitting next to each other probably look judas is scary it was there probably the best one of the bunch the one that looked the best a man's man one that they trusted to take care of the finances the first trustee think about it i'm glad we've got good trustees who aren't judases but even his name goes down in history as a betrayal of christ he's there jesus washes his feet because it's after that that he leaves i want to ask you something if you had to wash judah's feet and you knew who he was would you be able to do it that shows me that jesus was god he got down and judas was there and he got down right in front of judas and knew in a few hours he'd give him the kiss of death turn him over to the authorities and he washed his feet just like the rest of them and didn't think didn't let any of them know and when he said one of you will betray me they had no idea who it was no clue because he treated one just as good as another oh god give me a heart like that lord let me have that spirit lord that no matter who i washed feet with back there i've never washed feet with judas iscariot but let me have the same attitude toward every one of them you understand you say well you know if preachers were perfect today we we would get along and and we would come and we would do things right these preachers weren't perfect and this was the best of the best this is the best that god could find and it was a bunch of of renegades they were unlearned and illiterate most of them flying off the handle denying christ messed up but god called him out of that amen amen if you're looking for a perfect church that wasn't it but it's the ones that jesus called that's right i want you to look around the room think peter watched his wife be killed in front of him and then was crucified upside down at his request because he didn't want to be that bold brash man didn't want to be crucified like jesus andrew died on a cross on the mission field they hung him with a rope instead of nails to prolong the pain and for two days he hung by the side of the road still introducing people to jesus james is martyred by herod agrippa who's been destroyed by god he's the first apostle to give his life philip is crucified because of the conversion of the wife of a roman official nathanael was a missionary to india and was either beheaded or crucified on the mission field thomas was martyred in northern india matthew was probably burned at the stake in ethiopia james celeste was also martyred and of course because he was james celeste we don't know how somebody's got to fulfill that role all right libya thaddeus is martyred with an axe in syria simon the zealot was murdered with a saul for preaching the gospel john is the only one who lives as an old man he's carried to the pulpit at ephesus because they tried to boil him in oil and couldn't get he couldn't kill him and after he gets finally gets off the isle of patmos he comes back and he simply says little children love one another amen none of them these ended up being the greatest men of the christian faith the apostles that the foundation would be built on are you still with me tonight we're about to turn over to communion service the foundation was built on the apostles and prophets everything we believe was built on what they taught and yet none of them washed jesus feet they all missed that opportunity oh i don't want to miss that opportunity tonight when i get down i get down on my knees and i get down to to wash your feet whoever i might wash your feet i want to look at that and say this is the feet of jesus they passed up the opportunity but there come a time when they wash one another's feet because he said you'll be happy if you'll do this none but an ill-famed woman wash his feet what a what a testament to the character of christ but jesus look around the room jesus washed all their feet even judas he submitted himself to be the slave because that was the job a slave would do the lowest order of slave he submitted himself to be the slave of sinful men listen to this quote as the musicians come you're ready for communion service brother brown said be like david i'd rather be a doormat at the house of my god oh i'd go if they'd let me do something oh church be like david i'd rather be a doormat than to dwell in the tents with the wicked jesus put himself even lower than james the less and even lower than judas that's right wherever you call me lord let me be the best doormat you ever had if the people have to wipe their feet on me let me be a real doormat i'll clean feet if nothing else that's what jesus did listen how brother brandon puts this when he come to the earth he become god's doormat oh my so the disciples would have a place to wipe their feet he became god's doormat his own son who are you bishop state presbyter when jesus become a foot washed funky a doormat at the house of the lord oh just the thought of it church i can't hardly preach it just at the thought of it they didn't even recognize what time it was or what was happening what he was doing but we recognize it today oh god help us to recognize it that's what jesus did when he come to the earth he become god's dormant his own son who are you bishops state presbyter when jesus become a foot wash funky a doormat at the house of the lord and then we think we're somebody because we got a doctor's degree we went through college look at your example what he did amen don't look to what the bishop did before you the presbyter before you whatever like that he might have been a good man that doesn't matter look at god what did he become the doorman so that we could be elevated to have our feet washed by god because you're not just washing deity's feet amen you are deity's feet being washed would you bow your heads with me thank you for bearing with me today i didn't intend to preach this service whether john bailey was going to come over and due to the circumstances with his sister and being in surgery it wasn't a good time but maybe he'll come some other time but i believe god ordained this service to be what it is don't look at the bishop don't look some great man look at jesus the author and finisher of our faith ultimately it's all about him and no one else when it becomes about me he'll take me out of the way if it becomes about you the same thing will happen it's not about even a prophet because the prophet being the messenger carried us took us his message carried us to christ but when we saw isaac amen then our heart fell in love he showed us the word he introduced us to the word it's not about the brown said i wasn't the one standing at the river i was the only one standing near amen i'm so glad we had a prophet like that i'm so glad we had a god like that that got down on his knees and i've watched some of you do that and when you don't feel like it you're in pain sometimes yeah you wash jesus feet he sees that he knows you come to an afternoon service you think well it's just going to be a long day but he sees that you're here maybe you have a special need tonight and you're just something on your heart that you just need the holy spirit to fix before we go to the communion service while this presence is here would you just reach out to him say lord lord i have need of you today come by [Music] if you were willing to wash the disciples feet you're able lord to come by and me my need today you can come by and speak to me i know i'm not perfect but you wash the feet of imperfect disciples but they didn't know enough having a sense to wash yours heavenly father lord you see the hands that are raised lord i feel your presence here tonight lord i'm just just broken up at the thought how that you lord would get your feet washed by a little woman a harlot but not by your own disciples but you washed their feet i'm so grateful for it today i'm so thankful there's nothing that i could bring lord nothing these people could bring what would we give in exchange for what we've been given but lord will take the cup as david said we'll take the cup we'll drink the communion wine and the bread break the bread we'll wash one another's feet that's the least we could do lord i pray for each and every one every individual need lord i pray for mothers with families lord struggling maybe they don't really know how i'm gonna raise my kids in an ungodly world i pray for them today i pray for couples struggling in their marriage oh god those about to be married lord and in a hard age for marriage would you protect them lord lord i pray for those that are in physical need tonight lord just by coming i believe you'll honor them lord whether it's from a headache to cancer whatever it is lord i pray god you'd take it away right now i believe that you're here to do that lord and i pray lord that i say go through this part of the service they would be completely well lord may there be a song of joy and rejoicing in the hearts of every man woman boy and girl lord may we lift our voices to you in our hearts and knowing you brought us out of the deep mighty clay and brought us according to your word to the table together we can't do that by ourselves we must have these other these others lord they may be like those disciples they may have made mistakes many of them not fit hardly to be in polite company but lord you made them all equal by washing all of their feet we thank you for that today i pray you'd help us to see one another that way lord is cleansed by your blood by your precious blood in jesus name amen sing it now in the cross [Music] be [Music] i'm sure so thank you lord the sweet rest thank you jesus be on the rich ever seen it brother allen seeing the course again in the cross in the cross with the steward oh be in my glory [Music] ever thank you lord [Music] shall find sweet
