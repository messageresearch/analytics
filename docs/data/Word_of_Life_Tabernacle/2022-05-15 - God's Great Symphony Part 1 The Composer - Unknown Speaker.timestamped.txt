[55:47] about god's great symphony this morning
[55:49] and deal with the composer matthew
[55:52] chapter 6 verse 24
[55:55] matthew chapter 6 verse 24.
[55:58] we'll read all the way down to verse 34.
[56:08] just a minute to turn
[56:10] matthew 6 24
[56:13] says no man can serve two masters
[56:16] either he will hate the one and love the
[56:18] other or else he will hold to the one
[56:20] and despise the other
[56:22] you cannot serve god
[56:24] and mammon
[56:26] therefore
[56:27] now in your bible that may be separated
[56:29] but the 24th verse goes with the 25th
[56:32] verse because he says therefore
[56:35] you can't serve two masters you can't
[56:36] serve god and anxiety yes you can't
[56:39] serve god and worry
[56:41] yeah
[56:42] right
[56:43] one or the other if you believe in a
[56:46] providential all-knowing caring god
[56:50] yeah yes yes and i've got to remind
[56:52] myself of this sometimes
[56:54] yes
[56:55] then you just can't spend your life
[56:56] worrying about things yes
[56:58] you can't serve one in the other
[57:00] therefore i say unto you take no thought
[57:02] for your life
[57:04] what you shall eat and if you go back in
[57:06] the in the original let's take no
[57:07] anxious thought so it's not that you
[57:09] never think about it but you don't worry
[57:12] about it
[57:13] take no thought for your life what you
[57:14] shall eat
[57:16] or
[57:16] what or what you shall drink nor yet for
[57:18] your body what you shall put on is not
[57:21] the life more than meat and the body
[57:23] then raiment
[57:25] behold the fowls of the air
[57:27] for they so not neither do they reap nor
[57:29] gather into barns
[57:31] yet your heavenly father feedeth them
[57:34] are you not much better than they
[57:36] which of you by taking thought can add
[57:39] one cubit unto his stature in other
[57:41] words if you put all of your effort and
[57:43] your worry and everything in it you
[57:45] could never be any taller than you are
[57:47] yeah
[57:48] all right brother david
[57:50] never be any taller than you are just by
[57:53] taking thought
[57:55] all right so why worry about it yeah
[57:57] sure
[57:58] right
[57:59] and and so he says you can't add one
[58:02] cubit to your stature by thought why
[58:04] take your thought for raiment why worry
[58:06] about what you're going to wear consider
[58:08] the lilies of the field how they grow
[58:10] they toil not neither do they spin
[58:13] and yet i say unto you that even solomon
[58:15] in all his glory was not arrayed like
[58:17] one of these
[58:19] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[58:22] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[58:24] cast into the oven shall he not much
[58:26] more clothe you
[58:28] o ye of little faith
[58:30] therefore take no thought saying what
[58:32] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[58:34] wherewithal shall we be clothed
[58:36] after all these things do the gentiles
[58:38] seek
[58:39] for your heavenly father knows that you
[58:42] have need of all these things
[58:44] but seek ye first the kingdom of god
[58:46] that's why you're here this morning
[58:48] isn't it to seek the kingdom of god
[58:50] and his righteousness and all these
[58:53] things shall be added unto you
[58:56] take therefore no thought for the moral
[58:58] for the moral shall take thought for the
[59:00] things of itself
[59:02] sufficient unto the day
[59:04] is the evil thereof let's bow our heads
[59:06] together maybe you have a special
[59:08] unspoken request today you'd like to
[59:10] make known by way of uplifted hand god
[59:12] sees each and every one of those hands
[59:14] this morning heavenly father we approach
[59:17] your throne today and thank you for your
[59:19] grace that you poured out on us we thank
[59:22] you lord because we could not do it on
[59:24] our own lord we could not add one one
[59:27] foot to our stature lord one inch lord
[59:30] but you have brought us the way that you
[59:32] brought us and and you've given us food
[59:35] and clothing and the natural things and
[59:37] the spiritual things as well we're so
[59:40] thankful for that today i pray that you
[59:42] to help us lord i know these needs that
[59:44] are represented are real needs that or
[59:46] the by evidence of the raised hand lord
[59:49] i pray that you would meet every need
[59:51] lord that you you are the only one that
[59:53] can do that and i i pray that you would
[59:55] today i know it's your desire to do that
[59:58] and you're waiting lord to be called on
[1:00:00] and i pray lord that we would call on
[1:00:01] you now to meet each and every one of
[1:00:03] these needs lord and we and we know that
[1:00:05] you will i pray you'd bless these people
[1:00:07] move me out of the way speak directly to
[1:00:10] every situation that needs to be spoken
[1:00:12] to today we pray in jesus name amen
[1:00:16] god bless you you can be seated
[1:00:24] life as we know it is either controlled
[1:00:27] by a supernatural god or it's completely
[1:00:30] random yeah
[1:00:32] one of two things one of those two
[1:00:34] things is true
[1:00:37] you can't have both
[1:00:39] it either is god or it is random
[1:00:42] and it either either god cares or he
[1:00:45] doesn't care either he
[1:00:47] uh either he is god and deserves to be
[1:00:49] worshipped as such and
[1:00:51] and his word deserves to be followed as
[1:00:54] such or
[1:00:55] or there is no god and people can do
[1:00:57] whatever they want to do i will say this
[1:01:00] you don't want to you don't want to see
[1:01:01] the ramifications of that thought if you
[1:01:04] begin to think there is no god and you
[1:01:06] begin to dwell on that and realize then
[1:01:08] there's no purpose and if there's no
[1:01:10] purpose then there's nothing that
[1:01:12] nothing good and nothing bad and there's
[1:01:14] no wrong and there's no right and
[1:01:16] eventually you reach a place
[1:01:17] where you can go like the young man that
[1:01:20] the other day and went into the
[1:01:21] supermarket and shot 10 people but what
[1:01:24] was the point you know there's no point
[1:01:26] in existence you might as well
[1:01:28] just just take what's yours and
[1:01:30] and fight in that way but we don't fight
[1:01:32] natural battles like that because we
[1:01:35] believe in a god we believe that god
[1:01:37] takes care of us we believe that the
[1:01:39] complexity of life itself proves that
[1:01:42] there is a god just the fact that your
[1:01:45] dna there's something coated inside of
[1:01:47] you that actually is information
[1:01:50] information has to come from
[1:01:51] intelligence
[1:01:53] it doesn't come from randomness
[1:01:56] right you can take your watch and take
[1:01:58] it off if you have an old-fashioned
[1:01:59] watch that's got parts in it you can
[1:02:00] take it off in
[1:02:02] pieces and put it in a bag and shake it
[1:02:04] for a million years it would never tell
[1:02:06] time again why because it took
[1:02:08] intelligence to put the pieces together
[1:02:11] in order for it to work like your body
[1:02:13] works like the world works it takes a
[1:02:15] god to be able to do that
[1:02:17] and so if there's god like that if there
[1:02:19] is a god like that and we believe that
[1:02:21] there is then that god must care for you
[1:02:26] he must have things in his control
[1:02:28] and so the bible tells us this that not
[1:02:31] only
[1:02:32] not only are the big things controlled
[1:02:34] by god because that's where sometimes
[1:02:36] people leave it they're kind of agnostic
[1:02:37] in that way they think well there's a
[1:02:39] god but he doesn't really care about the
[1:02:41] minute details of my life but if you
[1:02:43] begin to look at it and realize that god
[1:02:45] if he is god if he is all-knowing if he
[1:02:48] is everywhere if he does know everything
[1:02:51] and and have everything in his in his
[1:02:53] grasp then every detail of life is
[1:02:56] controlled by his action or inaction
[1:02:59] because of who he is and so luke 12 and
[1:03:02] 6 tells us this are not five sparrows
[1:03:04] sold for two farthings and not one of
[1:03:07] them is forgotten before god
[1:03:11] just think of that the magnitude of that
[1:03:14] thought there are billions of birds
[1:03:16] on the earth today billions of them
[1:03:20] and billions upon billions and perhaps
[1:03:22] trillions of birds have been have been
[1:03:25] on the earth in the last 6 000 years
[1:03:27] think about it all of those birds have
[1:03:30] been counted
[1:03:31] yes
[1:03:32] and their entire life has been seen by
[1:03:36] god yes right
[1:03:38] right
[1:03:39] not one of them is forgotten that's
[1:03:41] right
[1:03:43] he knows every bird and if you had time
[1:03:46] he could tell you the details of its
[1:03:47] birth
[1:03:49] and how it flew and what was what
[1:03:51] happened to it he knew it he knew when
[1:03:53] it was born everything about it and all
[1:03:55] the way to the end you say the birds
[1:03:57] that's what the bible says
[1:03:59] he has not forgotten one of them
[1:04:02] right every little sparrow that you see
[1:04:04] out here he knows every every life every
[1:04:07] every form of life that there is he
[1:04:09] knows everything about it not one of
[1:04:12] them has forgotten before god he said
[1:04:14] but even the very hairs of your head are
[1:04:17] all
[1:04:18] numbered right
[1:04:20] remember jt for some of us that's easier
[1:04:22] than for others
[1:04:24] but even the ones that we've lost
[1:04:27] yes
[1:04:28] where are they at
[1:04:30] there have to be somewhere
[1:04:32] he knows where they are yeah
[1:04:34] right he knows where they are he he
[1:04:37] counts them he knows how many you have
[1:04:39] on your head right now how many you had
[1:04:41] five years ago 20 years ago he he counts
[1:04:44] the hairs of your head yes and it
[1:04:46] doesn't bother him a bit amen
[1:04:49] right you think about it you try to make
[1:04:50] a calculation you know somebody who's
[1:04:52] very good at math
[1:04:53] can make a calculation and they can go
[1:04:55] into that and i look at my kids math
[1:04:57] sometimes they bring home from school
[1:04:58] and i can't hardly handle that you know
[1:05:00] i i look at it i never did go that far
[1:05:03] in math and they're doing algebra and
[1:05:06] esther is finished uh six in her class
[1:05:09] in in algebra i think it was out of a
[1:05:11] hundred and something students and i
[1:05:12] look at that i couldn't do what she did
[1:05:14] three years ago
[1:05:16] i can't i can't do it and i begin to
[1:05:18] look at that and and think well but but
[1:05:21] to her it makes sense
[1:05:23] and she can keep track of it but think
[1:05:25] how much more
[1:05:26] if you look at what we know compared to
[1:05:28] what god knows
[1:05:30] our knowledge is limited but a person
[1:05:32] who's good at that they can just rattle
[1:05:34] it off they know they have a knowledge
[1:05:36] they have a gift to be able to do that
[1:05:38] and so god has the knowledge he has all
[1:05:41] knowledge he knows things that we can't
[1:05:43] even comprehend we don't think like he
[1:05:46] does
[1:05:47] and so we just have to trust him
[1:05:51] so we know then that according to the
[1:05:52] scriptures we are not in control of our
[1:05:54] lives we're simply acting on our part so
[1:05:57] brother branham likened that to a great
[1:05:59] symphony orchestra
[1:06:01] or an orchestra that was playing a
[1:06:03] symphony like particular in particular
[1:06:06] peter and the wolf if you've ever seen
[1:06:07] that as the children's symphony peter
[1:06:10] and the wolf
[1:06:11] and it's amazing that how it's acted out
[1:06:13] by the instruments and by the music so
[1:06:16] that there's no words but yet when
[1:06:18] you're listening to it
[1:06:19] and you and you know it you know what's
[1:06:21] going to happen next because
[1:06:24] you can feel it through the music itself
[1:06:26] and life is like that
[1:06:28] that we're all acting out apart
[1:06:31] and god is the composer of life he's the
[1:06:34] composer of this great symphony so
[1:06:36] brother branham says it this way talking
[1:06:38] about in a new year's sermon he said the
[1:06:40] new year i don't know what it holds but
[1:06:42] i know he holds it can we say amen to
[1:06:44] that today he said that's the hopes of
[1:06:46] new year i have if he comes amen if he
[1:06:48] doesn't come i'll still be working if he
[1:06:51] spares me i just trust the future to him
[1:06:54] i don't know what it is he said i just
[1:06:56] trusted to him he said you've seen him
[1:06:58] vindicate his word so you know it's
[1:07:01] going to be done his work yeah you say
[1:07:03] brother branham how do you get that well
[1:07:05] let me give some thought here just a
[1:07:06] minute do you know what a symphony is
[1:07:08] it's a music it's a drama acted out and
[1:07:10] he gives the example of peter in the wok
[1:07:12] he said now do you adults the scripture
[1:07:14] is god's symphony
[1:07:15] only the composer knows what it really
[1:07:17] means yes
[1:07:19] right the composer knows yes i'm not
[1:07:22] born with the knowledge or with the
[1:07:24] brain power
[1:07:25] to know what it really means
[1:07:27] but the composer knows he wrote the
[1:07:29] music yes and he knows why he wrote it
[1:07:32] and why the chord progressions are the
[1:07:34] way that they are and why
[1:07:36] why it's in the key that it's him he
[1:07:38] knows why he did what he did yeah
[1:07:42] right and so we don't understand that
[1:07:45] but he'll reveal that to us
[1:07:47] only the composer knows what it really
[1:07:48] means he reveals it to those who are
[1:07:50] listening
[1:07:52] now watch that's the key who are
[1:07:53] interested
[1:07:54] in knowing what the drama is yes
[1:07:57] so if you're interested in that today if
[1:08:00] you want to know what god wants known by
[1:08:02] his word you wouldn't necessarily go to
[1:08:04] a scholar somewhere but you go to the
[1:08:07] composer himself and you'd find out how
[1:08:10] do you want me to interpret the word
[1:08:13] right how do you want it played how do
[1:08:15] you want it live because the word is
[1:08:17] more than just a
[1:08:19] something that we read and something
[1:08:20] that it's a good thought that we have
[1:08:23] but when we read about he said take no
[1:08:25] thought for tomorrow we say lord how do
[1:08:27] you want that lived out
[1:08:29] right you want that lived out in in my
[1:08:31] life how do you want it lived out
[1:08:33] well you wouldn't go to me necessarily
[1:08:36] or to another person to find out you
[1:08:38] would go to the composer yeah
[1:08:40] right and find out how he wants it
[1:08:43] played
[1:08:44] now
[1:08:45] and and so he writes the music in the
[1:08:48] book
[1:08:49] or on the sheet music but now he's got a
[1:08:51] certain idea of how he wants it played
[1:08:54] he said but you'd have to know about a
[1:08:56] symphony first
[1:08:57] he said it's not just something you see
[1:08:59] it's the changing the junctions of the
[1:09:02] word of the music and you know that
[1:09:04] symphonies are written in different
[1:09:05] parks
[1:09:06] right there'll be a a part and then the
[1:09:08] music will sew down maybe it'll stop and
[1:09:10] then it'll go into another part and
[1:09:12] today in popular music today we have
[1:09:14] verses and of course
[1:09:16] but it's it's leading to something and
[1:09:19] and it's telling a story as you go
[1:09:21] through it that song that brother joel
[1:09:22] saying earlier
[1:09:23] it was telling a story about the
[1:09:25] resurrection of the dead dead girl if
[1:09:27] you think about that as telling that and
[1:09:29] so the song is getting to the plot to
[1:09:31] the part where it says i was like that
[1:09:33] little girl and and so it's applying it
[1:09:35] then so there's a historical verse and
[1:09:37] then an application verse and
[1:09:40] and so it's doing something but it's a
[1:09:41] change there's a difference in in the
[1:09:43] historical verse in the application
[1:09:45] verse and then the course to bring it
[1:09:47] all together now he said it's not just
[1:09:49] something you see it's the changing the
[1:09:51] junctions of the music he said it throws
[1:09:53] sometimes it's going this way for a
[1:09:55] while a certain beat after a while it
[1:09:57] changes all around what is it
[1:09:59] you who wouldn't understand it or don't
[1:10:00] know nothing about it or not interested
[1:10:02] in it it's just a racket it's a fuss
[1:10:05] right and that's what the preaching of
[1:10:06] the word now the preaching of the word
[1:10:08] and i know it's hard sometimes to
[1:10:09] understand why we preach and what we
[1:10:11] preach and
[1:10:12] and try to follow a preacher who's
[1:10:14] speaking fast and spinning all over the
[1:10:15] place it's hard to understand but the
[1:10:17] bible tells us that the preaching of the
[1:10:18] cross would be foolishness to the world
[1:10:22] right and a stumbling block to the jews
[1:10:24] but he said but through the foolishness
[1:10:26] of preaching god chose to save those who
[1:10:29] would believe not through foolish
[1:10:31] preaching but through the foolishness of
[1:10:33] preaching the very act of preaching
[1:10:35] itself but you who are interested if
[1:10:37] you're interested in knowing what god
[1:10:39] says
[1:10:40] then you would you would hear a preacher
[1:10:42] not everything the preacher says is
[1:10:43] correct but when that preacher lines up
[1:10:46] with the word then you know that god is
[1:10:48] interpreting his word to you yes sir
[1:10:51] right now now watch now
[1:10:53] he said it's a fuss to some people it
[1:10:55] don't make any sense but to those who
[1:10:57] know about it they're watching for it
[1:10:59] they know it's
[1:11:00] coming
[1:11:02] so we have these times of symphonies the
[1:11:04] symphony of god's word that the whole
[1:11:06] drama changes
[1:11:08] he said you who are interested listen
[1:11:10] for that change
[1:11:12] oh my you know it's getting close
[1:11:16] he said you hear the way the drums are
[1:11:18] beating
[1:11:19] he said you want something to happen
[1:11:21] no this is a change
[1:11:24] right the drums are beating and remember
[1:11:26] god's not just in control of you and me
[1:11:28] but he's in control of the whole world
[1:11:30] he allows everything to happen the way
[1:11:32] that it does
[1:11:33] and so the entire thing whenever you
[1:11:35] walk out in nature when you go out among
[1:11:37] the people and you see the way the
[1:11:39] people are and the bible tells you what
[1:11:40] the people would be like in the last
[1:11:42] days you can look at it and see that the
[1:11:44] symphony was meant to be a certain way
[1:11:46] and when you look around you you can see
[1:11:48] what time do we live in well the drums
[1:11:50] are beating a certain way and you can
[1:11:52] feel it moving up towards an end point
[1:11:54] moving up to a crescendo and you're
[1:11:56] finally getting up to that place and
[1:11:57] finally you get to a place where you
[1:11:59] realize hey hey there's a there's going
[1:12:02] to be a change here
[1:12:04] you anticipate it because one key or one
[1:12:07] chord and one
[1:12:08] one note leads to another yeah
[1:12:11] right and we'll talk maybe a little bit
[1:12:13] about that tonight but but you realize
[1:12:15] in music that one note
[1:12:17] calls for another note
[1:12:19] and that's why it sounds wrong when you
[1:12:21] play the wrong one
[1:12:24] right how does it sound wrong
[1:12:27] because there's something in your brain
[1:12:28] that a creator put there to appreciate
[1:12:30] music
[1:12:32] and so when if a piano player was
[1:12:34] playing and they would hit a wrong note
[1:12:36] or play a chord that doesn't go after
[1:12:38] another chord you hear it hurt it it'd
[1:12:40] make you cringe
[1:12:42] why most people anyway
[1:12:44] why would it do that
[1:12:46] it would do that because there's
[1:12:48] something in your brain that's wired to
[1:12:50] expect something to happen
[1:12:54] oh god if we can just realize that the
[1:12:56] word is that way as well
[1:12:58] that there's when we when we see god
[1:13:00] interpreting his word by bringing it to
[1:13:02] pass
[1:13:04] right and we see that some things have
[1:13:06] happened the prophet has come
[1:13:08] and the people are a certain way and the
[1:13:09] world is a certain way and the churches
[1:13:11] are a certain way and we look all around
[1:13:13] us and see we're living in the days of
[1:13:15] sodom and we see jesus said as it was in
[1:13:17] the days of sodom so shall it be in the
[1:13:18] coming of the son of man so we look at
[1:13:20] that we begin to realize there's
[1:13:22] something going to change
[1:13:24] right there's a change coming well what
[1:13:25] change are we looking for now we're
[1:13:27] looking for the rapture of the church
[1:13:30] right we're looking for a body change
[1:13:32] because that's the change you see the
[1:13:34] drum beat the crescendo it's building up
[1:13:36] to that and even people in the world can
[1:13:38] see it where it's it's a it's a crazy
[1:13:40] hour the world's gone nuts
[1:13:43] why why do people live like they do why
[1:13:45] is there so much people that don't care
[1:13:47] why is there so much of sin on the earth
[1:13:49] today well the bible tells us it'll
[1:13:51] increase and increase until the end but
[1:13:53] when the end when the end is about to
[1:13:55] come you feel the pulsation of it the
[1:13:57] beat of it and you look into the word
[1:13:59] you can see something's going to happen
[1:14:00] yes
[1:14:02] oh my i believe we're living in those
[1:14:04] times
[1:14:05] he said you hear the way the drums are
[1:14:07] beating want something to happen you
[1:14:08] know this is a change it's going to
[1:14:10] break out in a burst in a few minutes
[1:14:11] and you're watching for it you can tell
[1:14:13] the way the drums are timing he said if
[1:14:15] you can hear the drums of the finish now
[1:14:17] if you can hear the echo oh how many of
[1:14:18] you can hear the drums of the finish
[1:14:20] this morning you can hear the echo of
[1:14:22] the music of the heavenly word seeing
[1:14:24] itself out
[1:14:26] and it shall come to pass in the last
[1:14:27] days
[1:14:28] the symphony of god's great drama that
[1:14:30] he's playing now notice he says it
[1:14:32] changes him
[1:14:35] because he's the main actor
[1:14:37] yes sir
[1:14:38] i think about it well again we'll talk
[1:14:40] more about that tonight but he changes
[1:14:41] from glory to glory
[1:14:43] christ
[1:14:44] was god with a different mask on if we
[1:14:46] could put it like that
[1:14:48] right it was god robed in flesh
[1:14:51] he did appear as a pillar of fire he did
[1:14:54] appear as jehovah god in the old
[1:14:56] testament now but now christ is god with
[1:14:58] a mask on he's a great actor in the
[1:15:00] symphony
[1:15:01] he's acting out in the drama or in the
[1:15:03] play
[1:15:04] according in the music he's playing and
[1:15:06] the people are doing what they're doing
[1:15:08] but he come right at the time that he
[1:15:09] was supposed to come when the world was
[1:15:11] falling apart in that time he came
[1:15:14] and he'll come this time the second time
[1:15:16] in the time when he was supposed to come
[1:15:18] yes
[1:15:19] amen so now he says he knows all about
[1:15:22] it and and he says that the symphony of
[1:15:25] god's great drama that he's playing it
[1:15:26] changes him his symphony at the junction
[1:15:28] the composer and those who are
[1:15:30] interested listen for the change he said
[1:15:32] that's what all this stuff is to us
[1:15:34] we're listening
[1:15:36] we're watching every time he appears
[1:15:37] something happens we see the time
[1:15:40] getting close he said remember the
[1:15:42] composer knows the end from the
[1:15:44] beginning right
[1:15:46] yeah we don't because we haven't heard
[1:15:47] the song before
[1:15:50] right we've got the music the sheet
[1:15:52] music yeah but we've never heard it
[1:15:56] i hope you're listening to me now
[1:15:58] he said you begin to listen to the music
[1:16:00] and you know what it is you know just
[1:16:02] about here's where certain certain
[1:16:03] things are taking place now it's got to
[1:16:05] change now anybody else that don't know
[1:16:07] nothing about just walked in and sat
[1:16:09] down it's just a bunch of nonsense
[1:16:10] rattling noise but the one who knows
[1:16:12] what it is it's beat out with the music
[1:16:14] drummed out with the notes it's
[1:16:15] trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung
[1:16:17] on the harp it's played with the violin
[1:16:18] it's beat on the bass it's sounded by
[1:16:20] the trumpets the speed on the drums the
[1:16:22] whole thing's together in rhythm and it
[1:16:24] makes the drama to you can close your
[1:16:25] eyes
[1:16:27] and live in it all right
[1:16:31] now who is the composer the composer is
[1:16:33] the creator
[1:16:35] of the music
[1:16:36] let's go to isaiah chapter 40. if you
[1:16:39] have your bibles isaiah chapter 40 and
[1:16:41] verse 12
[1:16:43] the composer is the creator of the music
[1:16:48] he says
[1:16:49] i love this chapter and i couldn't just
[1:16:51] read a couple of verses i i think we
[1:16:53] need to comprehend
[1:16:54] what the prophet is saying here the
[1:16:56] prophet isaiah
[1:16:57] he says who hath measured the waters in
[1:16:59] the hollow of his hand
[1:17:02] and meted out heaven with the span
[1:17:04] measured the universe
[1:17:07] and comprehended the dust of the earth
[1:17:09] in a measure as if god was assigned
[1:17:12] scientists in a lab right
[1:17:14] right and he's got the waters in his
[1:17:17] hand
[1:17:19] and he's got the dust in a in a
[1:17:21] measuring jar
[1:17:23] a measuring cup
[1:17:25] and he's weighed the mountains on scales
[1:17:30] about the alps with the rocky mountains
[1:17:32] some great mountain range god's got him
[1:17:34] on his scales
[1:17:36] and the heels in a balance
[1:17:39] who has directed the spirit of the lord
[1:17:42] you ever told god what to do you won't
[1:17:46] you may try
[1:17:49] but god laughs when we tell him our
[1:17:50] plans
[1:17:54] can't tell god what to do
[1:17:56] so god
[1:17:58] you and i've seen that sometimes in
[1:18:00] pentecostal realms and then and we're a
[1:18:02] little pentecostal ourselves i guess but
[1:18:05] i've seen it where people demand god
[1:18:06] you've god
[1:18:07] you must do this god we demand that you
[1:18:09] do this you don't demand god you come
[1:18:12] and remind god of his word
[1:18:14] god you said
[1:18:16] right you said you would do it yeah you
[1:18:19] said you would do it and so
[1:18:21] and so but we want to demand god he said
[1:18:23] who has directed the spirit of the lord
[1:18:25] you didn't tell him what to do
[1:18:28] huh you don't even you can't even know
[1:18:30] what tomorrow holds
[1:18:31] you don't know
[1:18:33] what even what to the rest of the day
[1:18:34] holds but he knows
[1:18:37] or being his counselor has taught him in
[1:18:39] other words who who sit there now god
[1:18:41] you don't know everything so i'm going
[1:18:42] to tell you
[1:18:44] now isn't that ridiculous
[1:18:46] on our part wouldn't that be ridiculous
[1:18:48] to sit there and say god you don't know
[1:18:49] everything
[1:18:50] so i'm going to tell you i'm going to
[1:18:52] just pull it out of my own mind
[1:18:55] that's not what we do with god
[1:18:57] we trust him
[1:18:59] he said with whom took he counsel who
[1:19:01] instructed him and taught him in the
[1:19:03] path of judgment taught him knowledge
[1:19:04] and showed him the way of understanding
[1:19:07] he said behold the nations are as a drop
[1:19:09] of a bucket yeah
[1:19:11] and are counted as the small dust of the
[1:19:14] balance in other words what's left over
[1:19:17] after you've weighed something
[1:19:20] the small dust of the balance
[1:19:22] behold he taketh up the isles as a very
[1:19:26] little thing
[1:19:27] the continents
[1:19:29] lebanon is not sufficient to burn
[1:19:31] he said you're going to make a sacrifice
[1:19:33] to god that god will be pleased with and
[1:19:35] you're just going to make it up lebanon
[1:19:37] is not sufficient to burn
[1:19:39] the famous cedars of lebanon was a great
[1:19:40] forested country there lebanon is not
[1:19:43] sufficient to burn
[1:19:44] or the beast thereof sufficient for a
[1:19:46] burnt offering
[1:19:48] you don't get to make those things up
[1:19:50] you do what he asks yes
[1:19:53] right
[1:19:54] all nations before him or is nothing and
[1:19:57] they are counted to him less than
[1:20:00] nothing
[1:20:01] and vanity
[1:20:03] to whom then were you liking god or what
[1:20:05] likeness were you comparing to him
[1:20:08] so you're going to you're going to make
[1:20:09] god something no god reveals himself yes
[1:20:14] oh my
[1:20:15] what were you liking god too he said the
[1:20:17] melted this was back in the days of
[1:20:18] idolatry when they would have an image
[1:20:21] then they said that's god
[1:20:23] the workmen melted the graven image and
[1:20:25] the goldsmith spreaded it over with gold
[1:20:28] and catched a silver chains
[1:20:30] it says he that is so impoverished that
[1:20:33] he has no oblation in other words he
[1:20:34] don't even have money for an offering
[1:20:37] but yet being poor and when you see this
[1:20:39] in poor countries many times they're
[1:20:41] overtaken by churches and religions that
[1:20:43] make them perform all of these things
[1:20:45] and give all their money to the church
[1:20:47] or to the religion and it's very sad
[1:20:49] either so impoverished yet no ablation
[1:20:51] chooses a tree that will not rot he
[1:20:54] seeks unto him a cunning workman he
[1:20:56] spends all his money and his time to
[1:20:58] find somebody to prepare a graven image
[1:21:00] that shall not be moved he wants
[1:21:02] something solid he tries to set it up in
[1:21:03] his house he said have you not known
[1:21:06] have you not heard has it not been told
[1:21:08] you from the beginning have you not
[1:21:10] understood from the foundations of the
[1:21:12] earth
[1:21:13] it is he that sitteth upon the circle of
[1:21:15] the earth
[1:21:16] now watch they didn't know
[1:21:18] scientists in that day in fact for
[1:21:20] several thousand years they didn't know
[1:21:22] the earth was round
[1:21:24] yeah
[1:21:25] but isaiah said he sat on the circle of
[1:21:27] the earth
[1:21:29] oh my
[1:21:31] and the inhabitants thereof are as
[1:21:32] grasshoppers
[1:21:34] that stretcheth out the heavens
[1:21:36] as a curtain
[1:21:38] and spreadeth them out as a tent to
[1:21:40] dwell in he said have you not heard of
[1:21:41] him you want to set up an idol try to
[1:21:43] make him into the image of what you want
[1:21:45] him to be and that's what so many people
[1:21:47] do today is try to take this great
[1:21:49] composer and say now i want you to play
[1:21:51] the music this way i want you to i want
[1:21:53] you to apply it this way i want you to
[1:21:55] interpret it this way we don't get to do
[1:21:57] that he's the composer he's the creator
[1:22:00] right and so we don't get to tell him
[1:22:02] what to do and how to do it
[1:22:05] right
[1:22:06] god is sovereign
[1:22:09] right what that means is no one tells
[1:22:10] him what to do
[1:22:13] right we don't get to tell him what to
[1:22:14] do
[1:22:15] but he has every right to tell us what
[1:22:17] to do
[1:22:19] everybody said well i'm a sovereign
[1:22:20] citizen that may be true in a nation but
[1:22:24] it's not true when it comes to god
[1:22:27] you got you have to work with god yeah
[1:22:29] yes sure
[1:22:31] you don't get to work live life apart
[1:22:34] from him if you think you do it's just
[1:22:37] that much more sad in the end
[1:22:40] because every knee will bow
[1:22:43] and every tongue will confess that he is
[1:22:45] god
[1:22:46] he is lord
[1:22:48] now watch he sits on the circle of the
[1:22:50] earth and he have inhabitants there's
[1:22:51] grasshoppers and he stretches the
[1:22:53] heavens as a curtain and spreads him out
[1:22:54] as a tent to dwell in he brings the
[1:22:56] princess to nothing he makes the judges
[1:22:58] of the earth as vanity
[1:23:00] he got control over the presidents and
[1:23:02] the and the hierarchies and the bishops
[1:23:04] and all the things of the earth
[1:23:07] right
[1:23:08] yea they shall not be planted yes they
[1:23:10] shall not be stone sown yet their stock
[1:23:12] shall not take root in the earth he
[1:23:13] shall also blow upon them and they shall
[1:23:15] wither the whirlwind shall take them
[1:23:16] away a stubble
[1:23:18] imagine the king of that day would stand
[1:23:20] up and say i'm going to have a king i'm
[1:23:21] going to be a king like saul as we've
[1:23:23] been studying saul on wednesday night
[1:23:25] that that he would stand up there and
[1:23:26] say i'm going to have a line of people
[1:23:28] that's and my kids are going to rule

[1:23:41] the ones that you have may be taken away
[1:23:44] you don't know god controls those things
[1:23:49] he says now
[1:23:50] to whom were you lacking me or or shall
[1:23:53] i be equal saith the holy one i love the
[1:23:55] way he says that shall he didn't say
[1:23:56] shall i be equal to what shall i be
[1:23:58] equal

[1:27:26] he's the creator yes
[1:27:28] who is this composer he's also the
[1:27:30] conductor yeah
[1:27:32] think about it for a moment he's a
[1:27:34] creator he also conducts the music many
[1:27:36] times in history great composers have
[1:27:39] also been great conductors
[1:27:41] bach and beethoven and the different
[1:27:43] the different uh
[1:27:45] great the great musicians and great
[1:27:48] composers of the days gone by
[1:27:51] they've also been great conductors
[1:27:54] today i think it's john williams that
[1:27:55] conducts his own orchestra different
[1:27:57] ones great musicians great composers
[1:28:00] conduct their own orchestra and if you
[1:28:02] ever watch one you go on youtube and
[1:28:03] watch a conductor who also composed the
[1:28:06] music there's something different about
[1:28:08] it
[1:28:09] he does it the way he wants it done
[1:28:11] he does it exactly in the way
[1:28:14] that it ought to be done
[1:28:16] now a conductor serves as a messenger
[1:28:18] for the composer
[1:28:20] it's their responsibility to understand
[1:28:22] the music and convey it through gesture
[1:28:25] that's why he's up there doing this
[1:28:28] i know i'm not doing that right but
[1:28:30] right he's got the baton so the single
[1:28:32] baton you know
[1:28:34] and he'll stand on a box or a little
[1:28:36] stool if he's not tall enough he'll get
[1:28:38] up there and just do like this
[1:28:41] well what's he doing he's conducting and
[1:28:43] he'll go sometimes he'll go real slow
[1:28:45] and at times he'll speed it up and at
[1:28:47] times he'll go real fast yeah right and
[1:28:50] what's he doing he's he's conducting not
[1:28:53] only the beat of the music but the mood
[1:28:55] and the feeling of the music
[1:28:58] are you still with me this morning
[1:29:01] just bear with me
[1:29:03] don't
[1:29:04] i if if you
[1:29:06] if you get tired get up and
[1:29:09] get a drink move around a little bit i'm
[1:29:10] not going to hold you that long
[1:29:12] we got tonight to finish it but i just
[1:29:14] want to get this part of this thought
[1:29:15] out
[1:29:16] now look it's
[1:29:18] it's the conductor's responsibility
[1:29:19] understanding me to convey it through
[1:29:21] gesture so transparently that the
[1:29:23] musicians in the orchestra understand it
[1:29:26] perfectly
[1:29:27] and then those musicians can transmit a
[1:29:29] unified vision
[1:29:31] of the music to the audience now notice
[1:29:34] he is the conductor what did god do when
[1:29:36] he needed a conductor who's he going to
[1:29:38] find
[1:29:39] because moses was a great prophet but he
[1:29:42] could not perfectly
[1:29:43] conduct god's people
[1:29:47] are you with me now
[1:29:49] isaiah was a great prophet
[1:29:51] jeremiah was a great prophet ezekiel was
[1:29:53] a great prophet but he could not
[1:29:55] perfectly conduct the music
[1:29:58] none of them were without sin
[1:30:01] right and sin is missing the mark
[1:30:03] it's getting off of the music
[1:30:06] right
[1:30:08] and so each one of them had made a
[1:30:10] mistake
[1:30:12] every one of them
[1:30:13] made mistakes
[1:30:15] so god came down
[1:30:18] it was his purpose
[1:30:20] that the music would be lived
[1:30:23] that it would be manifested in such a
[1:30:25] real way that it would be conducted in
[1:30:27] such a real way that he came down
[1:30:33] and and showed it to us
[1:30:36] played it for us yes
[1:30:38] all right come on sure he come down in a
[1:30:41] body of flesh and a woman called mary a
[1:30:44] virgin girl and he come down into that
[1:30:46] body the great truth of god coming down
[1:30:50] and condescending down into the body of
[1:30:52] a woman and he comes down on our level
[1:30:54] and he conducts
[1:30:56] the music
[1:30:58] from the earth
[1:31:02] every move that he made was perfect
[1:31:07] oh if we could say it like this the
[1:31:09] father looked down and said there
[1:31:10] are my son conducting
[1:31:12] it's god in flesh
[1:31:14] right but he separates god can separate
[1:31:17] himself without diminishing himself
[1:31:19] right yes sir because he's it's because
[1:31:21] he's not a limited number see if we
[1:31:23] separate ourselves there there'd be a
[1:31:25] diminished thing right right but god
[1:31:27] separates himself there's no
[1:31:28] diminishment because he's limitless to
[1:31:31] begin with
[1:31:33] right that's why he can make the fish
[1:31:34] and the loaves he separates the fish and
[1:31:36] there's just more fish
[1:31:37] yeah
[1:31:38] right he's god yeah and so he looks i
[1:31:41] said this is my beloved son
[1:31:44] right who plays the music perfectly
[1:31:47] right
[1:31:48] who conducts it perfectly yes and the
[1:31:50] disciples followed him because they
[1:31:52] recognize here is a conductor that can
[1:31:54] conduct the music in such a way that
[1:31:56] will make us able to live it make us put
[1:31:59] a reality in it that'll heal the sick
[1:32:01] that'll raise the dead a conductor that
[1:32:03] can bring us right exactly where we want
[1:32:05] him to be
[1:32:07] but jesus began to tell him he said he
[1:32:09] said i gotta go away
[1:32:11] it's expedient for you that i go away
[1:32:13] and he tells them this in john 14 18 he
[1:32:15] said i will not leave you comfortless i
[1:32:18] will come to you
[1:32:20] i will not leave you comfortless that
[1:32:22] word is dorphanos i'm not going to leave
[1:32:24] you without a conductor
[1:32:26] oh god
[1:32:27] he said i will come to you these things
[1:32:30] have i spoken unto you verse 25 being
[1:32:32] yet present with you but the comforter
[1:32:35] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[1:32:36] will send in my name he shall teach you
[1:32:38] all things and bring all things to your
[1:32:40] members now remember what he just said
[1:32:42] he said i will not leave you comfortless
[1:32:44] i will come yes and now he speaks as if
[1:32:47] it's another another person another
[1:32:49] event he said the comforter which is the
[1:32:50] holy ghost whom the father will send in
[1:32:52] my name he shall teach you all things
[1:32:54] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:32:56] whatsoever i have said unto you
[1:32:59] he said
[1:33:00] peace i leave with you my peace i give
[1:33:02] unto you not as the world giveth give i
[1:33:04] unto you let not your heart be troubled
[1:33:07] neither let it be afraid the conductor
[1:33:09] is here
[1:33:10] so i don't know what i'm going to do
[1:33:12] tomorrow i'm frozen playing the violin
[1:33:15] i'm frozen at the drums i don't know
[1:33:17] what tomorrow holds but the conductor is
[1:33:19] here
[1:33:20] he said i'm not going to leave you
[1:33:22] without a conductor
[1:33:24] hallelujah
[1:33:26] and he said peace i'll leave with you
[1:33:27] i'm going to leave peace with you
[1:33:29] my peace i've given to you he said i'm
[1:33:31] not going to leave you without this
[1:33:33] peace i'm not going to leave you without
[1:33:34] my person being with you john chapter 16
[1:33:37] and verse 7. he said nevertheless i tell
[1:33:39] you the truth it is expedient for you
[1:33:41] that i go away for if i go not away the
[1:33:43] comforter will not come unto you but see
[1:33:45] listen remember the disciples could not
[1:33:47] play the music perfectly even though
[1:33:49] they had the perfect conductor but he
[1:33:51] said now i want to do something
[1:33:52] different
[1:33:54] oh god
[1:33:55] he said i'm going to do something
[1:33:57] different if i go not away the comforter
[1:33:58] will not come to you but if i depart
[1:34:00] i'll send him unto you
[1:34:02] when he has come he will reprove the
[1:34:04] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[1:34:06] judgment
[1:34:07] again in john 16 12 i've yet many things
[1:34:09] to say unto you but you cannot bear them
[1:34:10] now how be it when he the spirit of
[1:34:12] truth has come he will guide you into
[1:34:14] all truth for he shall not speak of
[1:34:15] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:34:17] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:34:19] things to come he shall glorify me for
[1:34:21] he shall receive of mine and shall show
[1:34:24] it unto you
[1:34:25] he's going to be perfectly in tune with
[1:34:27] the composer
[1:34:28] all things that the father hath her mind
[1:34:30] therefore said i that he shall take a
[1:34:32] mind and shall show it unto you a little
[1:34:33] while and you shall not see me and again
[1:34:35] a little while you shall see me
[1:34:38] because i go to the father
[1:34:40] now what is that what conductor what
[1:34:43] what happened the holy ghost fell amen
[1:34:46] said i'll not leave you comfortless i'm
[1:34:48] going to send the comforter
[1:34:50] i'm going to send the holy holy ghost
[1:34:53] brother bran i'm liking that to the
[1:34:54] mainspring in a famous watch and an
[1:34:56] old-fashioned watch that would that
[1:34:58] would that you'd have to wind up at a
[1:35:00] mainspring in it and the mainspring sits
[1:35:03] in the middle of the watch and controls
[1:35:04] every movement of the watch
[1:35:06] he said in the holy spirit is in the
[1:35:07] middle of your spirit the wash spring
[1:35:09] makes all the rest of the movements just
[1:35:11] kick just exactly to place keeping
[1:35:13] perfect time so before pentecost the
[1:35:15] disciples could not even fulfill the
[1:35:18] command of jesus to go into all the
[1:35:19] world and preach the gospel in every
[1:35:21] nation they could not fulfill that
[1:35:23] command these signs shall follow them
[1:35:24] that believe they couldn't do it but at
[1:35:26] pentecost something happened there came
[1:35:28] a sound from heaven like a rushing
[1:35:29] mighty wind and it filled all the houses
[1:35:31] they were sitting and tons of fire
[1:35:33] separated a pillar of fire sat down on
[1:35:35] each one of them and when that pillar of
[1:35:37] fire that that god that holy ghost come
[1:35:39] down on the inside of them all of a
[1:35:41] sudden they could go by the gate
[1:35:42] beautiful and when the lame man was
[1:35:44] sitting there they said silver and gold
[1:35:46] have i none but such as i have i give
[1:35:49] why they could play the music
[1:35:51] the way god wanted it to be played
[1:35:54] because of the holy ghost
[1:35:57] now again like into the watch it's the
[1:35:59] mainspring that does it it's the holy
[1:36:00] spirit that does it it isn't your church
[1:36:02] that does it it isn't your pastor that
[1:36:04] doesn't it isn't your shouting that
[1:36:06] doesn't it isn't your speaking with
[1:36:08] tongues it doesn't it isn't your healing
[1:36:10] service that doesn't it's the holy
[1:36:11] spirit that does it
[1:36:13] god's holy spirit in the middle of your
[1:36:15] new spirit it makes the whole church
[1:36:17] operate just exactly one big bundle of
[1:36:19] love
[1:36:20] oh what a wonderful way to describe a
[1:36:22] church
[1:36:28] amen i don't always feel like that well
[1:36:31] that's
[1:36:32] that's what we're striving for
[1:36:38] yeah
[1:36:39] it's the holy spirit that does it
[1:36:42] yes now what what are this conductor's
[1:36:44] responsibility see
[1:36:46] number one
[1:36:48] and the composer again is the conductor
[1:36:50] he come down he said i'll come to you
[1:36:53] he's also the conductor what are his
[1:36:54] responsibilities he chooses the time and
[1:36:56] the place
[1:36:57] he even chooses the venue
[1:37:00] the house that the music is going to be
[1:37:01] played in
[1:37:02] he wants it to represent who he is
[1:37:05] we've touched on it recently but
[1:37:07] galatians 1 15 paul said when it pleased
[1:37:09] god
[1:37:10] when it pleased god
[1:37:12] he separated me from my mother's womb
[1:37:13] but when it pleased him he called me by
[1:37:15] his grace
[1:37:17] right when it pleased god we don't have
[1:37:19] any say in when we're saved
[1:37:21] it's true
[1:37:22] right he said well i i sought god you
[1:37:24] did only because he sought you right if
[1:37:27] you had a desire to be in church this
[1:37:28] morning that didn't come from you
[1:37:30] come from god
[1:37:32] the composer and you ought to be
[1:37:34] thankful for that
[1:37:35] right because that that that's something
[1:37:37] that god puts in you not everybody has
[1:37:39] that desire to seek god and to be in the
[1:37:40] house of god
[1:37:42] but that's that's something he he's
[1:37:44] called you when it pleased god so that's
[1:37:46] his his responsibility to choose the
[1:37:48] time and the place listen you're a gene
[1:37:50] of your father you were in your father
[1:37:52] yet your father had no fellowship with
[1:37:53] you he was in there but you knew it not
[1:37:55] and he didn't know it but jesus
[1:37:56] manifested that he might have fellowship
[1:37:58] with you you being born again you're
[1:38:00] born of eternal life how many believe
[1:38:01] that today
[1:38:03] you're born again you're born of eternal
[1:38:04] life that's the holy spirit that dwells
[1:38:06] inside of you the only form of there's
[1:38:08] only one form of eternal life that's
[1:38:09] god's life zoe it's the greek word for
[1:38:11] it zoe only one form of eternal life he
[1:38:14] said then if you're a son of god or a
[1:38:15] daughter of god you were in god all the
[1:38:17] time
[1:38:18] right but he knew what bed and time
[1:38:19] you'd be planted see the difference in
[1:38:21] god in me is i didn't know i didn't have
[1:38:23] any control when i was a young man i had
[1:38:25] no control i didn't know when i'd get
[1:38:26] married i didn't know anything about it
[1:38:28] i finally come to find a wife that i
[1:38:30] loved and she loved me and she she was
[1:38:33] uh suitable for marriage and i was
[1:38:35] suitable i guess at the time for
[1:38:36] marriage and and so we got married and
[1:38:39] and we got married and had children but
[1:38:40] we really we tried to plan the best we
[1:38:42] could for our children and and playing
[1:38:44] our family and things but we didn't know
[1:38:46] those things we we had no control no
[1:38:48] real control you don't realize how
[1:38:50] little control you have to you stand in
[1:38:51] a delivery room
[1:38:53] and you can't make the baby live
[1:38:56] all right
[1:38:57] you realize that you can't make the baby
[1:38:59] live the baby has to live
[1:39:02] the baby has to grab that breath of life
[1:39:05] right you can't make that happen
[1:39:08] no control over that
[1:39:09] and so but you're a son or daughter of
[1:39:11] god but god knew
[1:39:13] what bed and time speaking of like a
[1:39:15] like a seed bed like a a garden bed
[1:39:18] right
[1:39:19] he knew what bed and time you'd be
[1:39:20] planted in
[1:39:22] right and so
[1:39:24] now he said you made a creature a son of
[1:39:25] god manifest the son or daughter of god
[1:39:27] to meet the challenge of this hour so he
[1:39:29] knew what bed and he planned what bed
[1:39:31] and he knew what garden you would grow
[1:39:32] in and what what the time would be like
[1:39:34] and what the people would be like and
[1:39:35] what the earth would be like at that
[1:39:36] time and he made you for this time you
[1:39:39] say brother ben i can't do it i can't
[1:39:40] live as a christian the pressure's too
[1:39:42] hard it's too much no he made you for
[1:39:45] this time
[1:39:46] if you're a son or daughter of god that
[1:39:48] has his genes in other words his and his
[1:39:50] genes are his thoughts you understand
[1:39:51] his his uh
[1:39:53] his his seed is his thought that he
[1:39:56] expressed in you when he expressed his
[1:39:58] thought in you he thought of you and he
[1:39:59] said you're going to be in laodicea
[1:40:01] you're going to be at a certain time
[1:40:03] you're going to live in 2022. you're
[1:40:05] going to live and you're going to go to
[1:40:07] church at a certain place and you're
[1:40:08] going to come up in a certain area god
[1:40:10] knew that you would be here not only
[1:40:11] knew but planned for you to be here
[1:40:14] and when he planned for you to be here
[1:40:15] he was choosing the time and the place
[1:40:17] that the music would be played
[1:40:19] hey man
[1:40:21] listen to vindicate to meet the
[1:40:23] challenge of this hour you say but this
[1:40:24] part of the music is harder but he
[1:40:26] planned to have musicians listen to me
[1:40:28] that could play that part
[1:40:31] yes
[1:40:33] you choose certain musicians because you
[1:40:35] know it's not too hard
[1:40:39] they can do it
[1:40:41] oh and i'm here to tell you today if
[1:40:43] you're here sitting here in the house of
[1:40:44] god you can do it it's not too hard to
[1:40:47] be a christian it's not too hard to
[1:40:49] follow god
[1:40:51] because he chose you to be here
[1:40:54] he chooses the instruments and the
[1:40:55] musicians
[1:40:58] you know you're expressed after his word
[1:41:00] is coming you to light up this age
[1:41:02] you're to light up the age not darken it
[1:41:05] light it up
[1:41:07] you're the expressing god's life in you
[1:41:09] because you're a son or daughter of god
[1:41:11] you are now made you're sitting in this
[1:41:12] church today because your duty is to
[1:41:14] express god to this nation or this
[1:41:16] people this neighborhood where you
[1:41:17] associate wherever you are god knew that
[1:41:19] you would be here because you have to be
[1:41:21] one of his genes or his attributes you
[1:41:23] have to be if you ever if you've got
[1:41:24] eternal life it always was eternal life
[1:41:26] and god before there was a foundation of
[1:41:27] the world knew that you would be here we
[1:41:29] know the bible teaches that
[1:41:31] he said i don't hardly understand how
[1:41:33] that we could think that a god that
[1:41:34] could prepare all these good things for
[1:41:35] us we could not put trust in him
[1:41:39] that if he brought us in this chaos that
[1:41:41] we're in now
[1:41:42] and prepared the good things of life for
[1:41:44] us here how much more can we trust him
[1:41:47] to prepare the things that is to come
[1:41:50] hallelujah eternal things
[1:41:52] and the bible tells us in john 14 2 and
[1:41:54] my father's house are many mansions if
[1:41:56] we're not so i would have told you i go
[1:41:58] to prepare a place for you
[1:41:59] for you listen for you individually he
[1:42:01] wasn't just saying that for as a general
[1:42:03] thing for a church for you individually
[1:42:05] he said therefore the bride and the
[1:42:07] rapture will come forth there was all
[1:42:08] pre-planned by god all backed up from
[1:42:10] the beginning he knew every man every
[1:42:12] place who would set all about it it's
[1:42:13] all free plan god knew it would be here
[1:42:15] and he made it that way so when we get
[1:42:17] there he's gone to prepare a place for
[1:42:18] us and when we get there we'll all be
[1:42:20] prepared just even like this night or
[1:42:22] this day is prepared like this hour is
[1:42:24] prepared
[1:42:26] and so the bible tells us in psalm 75
[1:42:28] and i'm hurrying now to get to the end
[1:42:30] this morning of this part of this he
[1:42:31] said lift not up your horn on high speak
[1:42:34] not with a stiff neck
[1:42:36] for promotion cometh neither from the
[1:42:38] east or from the west nor from the south
[1:42:40] but god is the judge
[1:42:42] he putteth down one and setteth up
[1:42:44] another
[1:42:45] christians are not revolutionaries
[1:42:49] right we don't go out and join militia
[1:42:50] groups to try to bring down the nation
[1:42:54] not according to scripture
[1:42:56] romans 13 1 says let every soul be
[1:42:58] subject to the higher powers for there
[1:43:00] is no power but of god
[1:43:02] right
[1:43:02] what a way to look at the world yes the
[1:43:05] powers that be are ordained of god it
[1:43:07] doesn't mean they're godly
[1:43:10] by the way
[1:43:11] but they're ordained of god
[1:43:13] right god needed that power in that
[1:43:15] place at that time to produce this world
[1:43:17] that we live in
[1:43:19] so the music would be right
[1:43:23] you don't think he's got control of
[1:43:24] every moment of the symphony
[1:43:27] of every tone of every tune of every
[1:43:29] note
[1:43:32] how does he conduct
[1:43:34] he conducts by the written music which
[1:43:35] is the word of god psalms 119 105. that
[1:43:38] word is a lamp into my feet
[1:43:41] lighted to my past so the first thing he
[1:43:42] does is he puts the music on on the
[1:43:45] written form and he puts it down in
[1:43:46] front of you now you've got to trust
[1:43:48] that yes
[1:43:50] right if you don't trust that
[1:43:52] then you'll never be able to play the
[1:43:54] music
[1:43:56] you got to trust the written music the
[1:43:57] sheet music
[1:43:59] you put it down in front of you
[1:44:01] and and so if you find a person get up
[1:44:03] and say well now that was for the
[1:44:04] apostolic age so if there's something
[1:44:06] written in the music that we're supposed
[1:44:07] to do and they say well it was for the
[1:44:08] apostolic age that would make you pause
[1:44:12] wait a minute but you got a wrong
[1:44:13] conductor yeah
[1:44:15] right you're listening to the wrong
[1:44:16] conductor
[1:44:18] he said now right quick if you've
[1:44:19] received the holy spirit you've been
[1:44:20] endowed with that since it sets it off
[1:44:22] there's something wrong there they try
[1:44:23] to explain it away this for another day
[1:44:25] you really don't need those things today
[1:44:26] but jesus said these signs shall follow
[1:44:28] them that believe
[1:44:30] see there's a little something sets off
[1:44:31] in you a little buzzer knowing that
[1:44:33] that's wrong and that's the way of death
[1:44:34] the conductor gets off his little buzzer
[1:44:36] why you've got the sheep music
[1:44:39] right
[1:44:41] he said because jesus said if we add one
[1:44:42] word to this or take one word from it
[1:44:44] our part is taken out of the book of
[1:44:45] life see not one scripture we must take
[1:44:47] it just the way it's written and god
[1:44:49] watches over his word all of this god
[1:44:52] watches over his word to perform it the
[1:44:55] same way that the conductor would watch
[1:44:57] over the the orchestra to perform the
[1:45:00] music god watches over his word to
[1:45:03] perform and we know that it's got to be
[1:45:04] just right so therefore no matter what a
[1:45:07] church would say what anyone else would
[1:45:08] say if you're born of the spirit of god
[1:45:10] you become part of the bible god told
[1:45:11] ezekiel the prophet take the scroll and
[1:45:13] eat it then the prophet and the scroll
[1:45:15] become part of each other and that's the
[1:45:16] believer when he receives the holy
[1:45:18] spirit the holy spirit wrote the bible
[1:45:19] and the spirit of god is the word of god
[1:45:22] hallelujah
[1:45:24] hey man now he's conducting yeah
[1:45:27] how does he conduct
[1:45:29] conducts by his presence
[1:45:31] and movement
[1:45:33] i want to hit this now before we go
[1:45:36] the composer conductor
[1:45:39] is present in the room
[1:45:41] he doesn't give him the sheet music and
[1:45:42] then leave come on
[1:45:45] but he walks up in front of him right
[1:45:47] yes
[1:45:48] and he takes the same music
[1:45:51] right oh god no no that's not me right i
[1:45:54] know i'm standing in front of you today
[1:45:55] and this is like an orchestra like laid
[1:45:56] out like this but no i'm not the
[1:45:58] composer conductor right it's the holy
[1:46:00] spirit yes
[1:46:02] that's right
[1:46:03] but
[1:46:04] he's in the room yes now notice what
[1:46:06] jesus said in matthew 18 20 he said for
[1:46:08] where two or three we got that today
[1:46:11] right
[1:46:13] are gathered together in my name
[1:46:15] now i misquote this sometimes
[1:46:18] sometimes i misquote this i say i will
[1:46:20] be
[1:46:22] right
[1:46:23] christ will be in the midst that's not
[1:46:24] what he said there am i
[1:46:27] now that's different i will be speaks of
[1:46:29] him being there in the future
[1:46:31] so we're looking for him to come
[1:46:34] right that's not what he said he said
[1:46:35] when two or three are gathered together
[1:46:36] there am i
[1:46:38] means he's here right now
[1:46:41] right yeah
[1:46:42] i'm not waiting on him to come yes
[1:46:46] and you've got to believe that
[1:46:49] and if you can't believe that yes he is
[1:46:52] here what did brother brian do what was
[1:46:54] the purpose of brother brandon's
[1:46:55] ministry it was to show the people that
[1:46:57] he was there
[1:46:58] that's why he could tell a person's name
[1:47:00] and their address where they come from
[1:47:01] and discern those fear have those
[1:47:03] visions it wasn't to show brother
[1:47:04] brahanna it was to show that he was
[1:47:06] there
[1:47:08] oh god
[1:47:09] there am i
[1:47:11] in the midst of him
[1:47:14] pentecost was the first time
[1:47:16] that they ever felt his presence after
[1:47:18] he left
[1:47:20] right
[1:47:20] here they were standing there in the
[1:47:22] upper room and all of a sudden they feel
[1:47:24] the presence and brother random told us
[1:47:25] this i'm closing in just a moment but
[1:47:27] told us this if you feel his presence
[1:47:29] yes sir go to him
[1:47:33] if you feel his presence if you know
[1:47:35] that he's there and you see him there in
[1:47:37] the word he said the word of the word is
[1:47:39] the spirit the spirit is the word
[1:47:41] if you see him in his word and you know
[1:47:42] he's there then go to him how do i go to
[1:47:45] him you touch by faith to him of his
[1:47:47] garment
[1:47:49] if you feel his presence go to him
[1:47:52] oh god blind bartimaeus went to him by
[1:47:55] his faith by crying out jesus thou son
[1:47:57] of david have mercy on me
[1:48:00] the woman with an issue of blood went to
[1:48:01] him by running and jumping and going
[1:48:03] under all the things see there's
[1:48:05] different ways you may have to do to get
[1:48:07] to him but if you feel his presence go
[1:48:09] to him
[1:48:11] and she ran and jumped and crawled under
[1:48:12] people and everything else to press her
[1:48:14] way the bible says through the crowd to
[1:48:16] touch the hymn of his garment which he'd
[1:48:18] have never felt in the flesh
[1:48:20] but he felt it amen he felt it because
[1:48:23] it was it was something when she touched
[1:48:24] him he felt her faith
[1:48:28] oh god he could feel that same faith
[1:48:30] today he's still here
[1:48:33] he said i will not leave you comfortless
[1:48:35] i will come to you the conductor is here
[1:48:38] right and when you feel his presence
[1:48:41] watch what he's doing
[1:48:43] you sense his movement
[1:48:46] if you feel his presence go to him a man
[1:48:48] that believes in god how many believers
[1:48:50] do we have today if you believe in god
[1:48:53] then you can see the presence of god
[1:48:55] feel the presence of god
[1:48:57] sense the presence of god and know he's
[1:49:01] here
[1:49:03] sometimes that'll make you shout and run
[1:49:04] but many times
[1:49:06] when you feel his presence
[1:49:08] it makes you say like i say oh woe is me
[1:49:13] i'm a man of unclean lips
[1:49:16] i live among a people of unclean lips
[1:49:17] and it took before he could go out and
[1:49:19] do what god told him to do he was
[1:49:21] willing he said here am i send me and
[1:49:22] the cherubim took a coal of fire off the
[1:49:24] altar and put it on his lips
[1:49:28] he was in the presence of god
[1:49:31] he's here a man can that can feel can
[1:49:33] see the presence of god can feel the
[1:49:34] presence of god since the presence of
[1:49:36] god no he's here he's here to answer
[1:49:38] everything that he made promise for in
[1:49:39] this day
[1:49:41] brother random again he said oh the
[1:49:42] greatest pleasure i know of is to pray
[1:49:45] until i can realize i'm in the presence
[1:49:46] of god and recognize it yes how many can
[1:49:49] do that i wonder how many of us really
[1:49:51] pray until we can feel the presence of
[1:49:53] god until we can recognize it
[1:49:56] oh god feel his presence recognize it
[1:49:59] and he said
[1:50:01] he said i think that that ought to be
[1:50:04] the thrill of the church yes
[1:50:07] not that some fantastic speaker come not
[1:50:09] that some not that some a great song was
[1:50:12] played it was played so some so
[1:50:14] eloquently and played so well that's not
[1:50:16] what it's about but it's god being
[1:50:19] present with us and when we pray until
[1:50:21] we can feel his presence and we
[1:50:22] recognize it he said that ought to be
[1:50:24] the thrill of the church it's the
[1:50:25] presence of the holy spirit
[1:50:28] seeing the god that made the promise
[1:50:30] standing among us feel his presence and
[1:50:32] see his word see it vindicated enough to
[1:50:34] give faith to make cripples walk blind
[1:50:36] see deaf here dumb speak amen
[1:50:40] do you believe it today
[1:50:42] do you believe it today
[1:50:44] if you believe it if you say well i know
[1:50:46] he's here because his word said where
[1:50:48] two or three are gathered in my name
[1:50:50] there am i
[1:50:51] there am i in the midst of him if you
[1:50:53] believe that and you believe he's here
[1:50:55] today then you believe the conductor is
[1:50:57] standing in front of you today not me
[1:50:59] but the holy spirit is here today if you
[1:51:01] believe that what do you have need of
[1:51:03] yes
[1:51:05] i'm challenging you this morning what do
[1:51:07] you have because the lord lord ask me to

[1:51:12] what he tells me to do i'm challenging
[1:51:14] you today do you believe it

[1:52:23] right at the end of the service
[1:52:25] where if the people would just receive
[1:52:28] they could have it and i watched some
[1:52:30] that did but i watch others that way

[1:53:00] brother ben i've been told that before
[1:53:02] you didn't believe it like you should
[1:53:05] because if we really believed in the
[1:53:06] presence of the lord jesus that he was
[1:53:09] here we'd never walk out with what we
[1:53:10] came in with
[1:53:17] we'd never walk out with what we came in
[1:53:18] with
[1:53:19] all of our burdens and our fears and our
[1:53:21] worry and our cares he said well i came

[1:54:28] take maybe to be a great pastor or a
[1:54:31] great preacher

[1:54:36] that if he is here

[1:54:47] if i can ever by prayer reach out and
[1:54:49] grab ahold by faith of that he is here
[1:54:52] then i'm not limited to my abilities
[1:54:55] or disabilities
