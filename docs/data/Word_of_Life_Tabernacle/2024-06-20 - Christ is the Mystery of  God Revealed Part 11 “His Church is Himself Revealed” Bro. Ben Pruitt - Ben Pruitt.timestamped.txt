[52:46] 30 read just both those
[52:50] verses I didn't hear if we had given a
[52:52] request for it but brother Joe sender's
[52:55] sister-in-law passed away when be
[52:56] praying for that family spoke with him
[52:59] today and and uh or texted with him

[53:17] family that's uh you know all of us have
[53:19] a time we have to go but that's such a
[53:22] surprise to them we need to remember
[53:24] them especially and our prayers
[53:27] Colossians chap 1:
[53:30] 18 and he he is the head of the body the
[53:34] church is the beginning the firstborn
[53:37] from the dead that in all things he
[53:41] might have the preeminence and then
[53:44] numbers
[53:45] 13:30 numbers
[53:49] 13:30 excuse me tonight the devil fights
[53:52] me on Wednesday night must be because
[53:55] the Lord has something good for us
[54:00] us numbers 13:30 and Caleb stealed the
[54:04] people before Moses and said let us go
[54:08] up at once look how different his
[54:10] testimony was from theirs all the the
[54:14] other spies said we can't take it at all
[54:17] and he said let's not even wait let's
[54:18] just go up let's go up at once and
[54:22] possess it we are well able to overcome
[54:25] it I pray the Lord would add his
[54:27] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[54:31] tonight most of the founders of today's
[54:34] denominations didn't intend for their
[54:36] movements to become denominations at all
[54:40] uh John Wesley talked about a dream that
[54:42] he had and in the dream he was ushered
[54:44] to the gates of hell and and he asked
[54:47] them there he said are there any
[54:48] Presbyterians here and they said yes he
[54:52] said are there any Baptists any
[54:53] episcopalians any methodists yes
[54:57] every time he brought up a denomination
[55:00] they said yes and then he was distressed
[55:03] and and then he was ushered to the Gates
[55:05] of Heaven and he asked the same question
[55:07] the answer was no he said are there any
[55:09] Baptists here no are there any
[55:11] episcopalians no the answer came back
[55:13] there's only Christians here so Wesley
[55:16] didn't want his movement to become a
[55:18] denomination but it did Martin Luther
[55:21] didn't want his movement to become a
[55:23] denomination the move of God that
[55:25] happened under justification ation he he
[55:27] said this he said I pray you leave my
[55:29] name alone do not call yourself
[55:31] lutherans but Christians but they didn't
[55:33] do it John Wesley said I wish the name
[55:36] Methodist might never be mentioned again
[55:39] lost in Eternal Oblivion Charles
[55:42] Spurgeon said I I say of the Baptist
[55:44] name let it perish let Christ's own name
[55:47] last forever he said I look forward with
[55:50] pleasure to the day when there will not
[55:51] be a Baptist living that's pretty strong
[55:54] but they didn't want a denomination and
[55:56] yet we have thousands of denominations
[55:59] today we have independent churches that
[56:02] have a a denominational
[56:04] identity each one claiming to be true
[56:08] and to have the truth and and we know
[56:10] that having a true founder is not enough
[56:13] to make you a true religion or a true
[56:15] church because you could have a true
[56:18] founder the Catholics had a true founder
[56:20] they say they were founded by Peter and
[56:22] yet you look at them today and what they
[56:24] are and so having a true founder doesn't
[56:27] mean you're the true church what is the
[56:29] church the church is the one established
[56:32] by Christ on the rock of revelation of
[56:35] who he is when he told Peter Thou Art
[56:37] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[56:40] church he said this is how you're going
[56:42] to be able to discern what the true
[56:45] church
[56:46] is is by the Revelation now I want to
[56:50] tell you this is important this
[56:51] revelation of who Christ is is important
[56:54] Christ is the mystery of God God
[56:56] revealed and then we could say the bride
[56:58] is the mystery of Christ revealed right
[57:01] because that's we are his uh the
[57:04] revelation of who he is and so this
[57:07] revelation of who he
[57:09] is is what identifies who the true
[57:12] church is and I'm glad to be identified
[57:14] in that number but we know that that
[57:16] Revelation doesn't come to a group right
[57:19] it come it don't come to a church it
[57:21] don't didn't come to Word of Life
[57:22] Tabernacle but it come to individuals he
[57:25] said he told Peter who do you say that I
[57:27] am who do you say not what does
[57:29] everybody say who do you say and he said
[57:32] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[57:33] Living God now and so we have a
[57:35] revelation that he is the word he is the
[57:40] word and he is the head of the church he
[57:44] has the preeminence in the church and
[57:47] therefore he has preeminence in our
[57:49] lives because we as individuals are the
[57:52] church and we are born again by
[57:55] revelation of who he is and and who he
[57:58] is in us and so any other thought
[58:00] outside of his word is a challenge to
[58:03] his
[58:04] authority right you can't go making your
[58:06] own
[58:07] laws right I I've seen videos of these
[58:09] people that claim to be Sovereign
[58:11] citizens I forgive me if any of you do
[58:13] this I I apologize right now but but
[58:17] I've seen these people come be Sovereign
[58:18] citizens you know and the cops will pull
[58:20] them over and and and they'll begin to
[58:22] argue with the policeman and said I
[58:24] don't have to have a driver's license I
[58:25] don't have to have this side of the
[58:26] other and and they all end up in jail I
[58:29] mean they every one of them end up
[58:31] having to do what they're what they do
[58:32] why because the authority is the
[58:34] American government for good or bad
[58:37] that's what it is and the authority in
[58:39] the true church is the word and no
[58:42] matter how much we think or what we
[58:44] think about something listen church we
[58:46] could have the best idea in the world
[58:48] but if it's not according to the word
[58:50] it's not true and so we've got to stay
[58:52] with the word that's who identifies it
[58:55] is not our emot that identifies us as
[58:57] the church it's not what we what we say
[59:00] about ourselves that identifies as the
[59:02] church but it's the word that we adhere
[59:04] to that what will identify the bride is
[59:07] she'll be a word bride and she won't
[59:09] just talk about the word but she'll
[59:11] manifest the word she'll produce the
[59:14] word in her life what the word says
[59:16] about her is what she'll be I'm so glad
[59:19] we can be that
[59:20] tonight amen and so the word is our
[59:24] Authority it's our protection it's our
[59:26] Fortress we can hide behind and we can
[59:28] always remember that you might get you
[59:31] you might feel like you you haven't felt
[59:32] God in a long time you might get to the
[59:34] place where you feel like that
[59:36] everything's gone against you and you
[59:38] feel like circumstances have brought you
[59:40] down but you can always trust the word
[59:43] the word is still going to be there no
[59:45] matter how you feel no matter what's
[59:47] happening in your life no matter what's
[59:48] going on around you or in your
[59:51] family God's word is still true he said
[59:54] I loved you before the foundation of the
[59:55] Earth that's his word you you grab a
[59:58] hold of that and believe
[1:00:00] it and so we don't want denomination
[1:00:02] because denomination takes away or adds
[1:00:04] to the word and the word is no longer
[1:00:06] pure and no longer
[1:00:08] effective right but and and I'll say
[1:00:11] this and I don't want to get into Sunday
[1:00:14] uh morning but we you know you can only
[1:00:17] manifest what you
[1:00:19] believe you got to believe in something
[1:00:22] you can only believe what you have a
[1:00:23] revelation of faith is a revelation
[1:00:26] right and so you got to have revelation
[1:00:28] of something you got to believe
[1:00:29] something is true and and in order to
[1:00:32] believe that it takes a revelation from
[1:00:34] God and so we believe that the message
[1:00:37] of the hour points us to the word which
[1:00:40] is Christ and that Christ being the word
[1:00:44] that we are we see the word revealed to
[1:00:46] us and we know that that word is true
[1:00:49] and it identifies who we are and what
[1:00:51] we're to be doing as a church in this
[1:00:52] hour is everybody clear on that tonight
[1:00:54] he is the word and he has the
[1:00:56] preeminence now brother Brandon says his
[1:00:59] church is
[1:01:01] himself
[1:01:03] revealed I love that he said do you see
[1:01:06] it and expressed by the word itself that
[1:01:10] he is
[1:01:11] God oh my so we actually are God's proof
[1:01:17] on the Earth today that he's
[1:01:19] God is your life and you say well you
[1:01:22] know I'm not proven that very well
[1:01:23] brother Ben I can't even don't have a
[1:01:25] dollar to my name I I I don't I don't do
[1:01:27] very much for God but yet the very fact
[1:01:30] that you go through the trials that you
[1:01:32] go through and you come out on the other
[1:01:34] side is proof that he's God the fact
[1:01:36] that you well you get sick sure but you
[1:01:39] get healed as well and it's proof that
[1:01:41] he's God and even down on your deathbed
[1:01:43] you don't give up who you are and what
[1:01:45] you believe why it proves he's
[1:01:48] God one day it'll be the final proof
[1:01:50] will be the Rapture and the resurrection
[1:01:53] that's the final showdown you ever
[1:01:55] wanted to have the last word well you
[1:01:57] will one day we're going to have the
[1:02:00] last word brother Joe and we've been
[1:02:02] promised that it's a final showdown
[1:02:05] there will come a time the devil can
[1:02:07] talk all he wants to but there's coming
[1:02:09] a time we're going to have the last word
[1:02:10] and the last word will be the voice of
[1:02:12] the Bride As She raises from this world
[1:02:15] as her body has
[1:02:17] changed amen talk about the final voice
[1:02:20] to the final age we will have the last
[1:02:24] word now but it's Church is himself
[1:02:27] revealed brother brandham starts with
[1:02:29] the as we go into this again into Christ
[1:02:31] is the mystery of God revealed brother
[1:02:33] brandham he makes the statement he said
[1:02:35] how can you say father Son and Holy
[1:02:37] Ghost then and be baptized in it if his
[1:02:39] word is himself revealed he said how can
[1:02:42] you be baptized in
[1:02:43] titles right the very word is Christ
[1:02:46] revealed he said how can you say you
[1:02:48] know Jesus Christ he is the word when
[1:02:51] there's not a scripture in the Bible
[1:02:53] there's not a place where anybody was
[1:02:55] ever baptized in the name of Father Son
[1:02:56] and Holy Ghost we know that uh Paul in
[1:03:01] when he talks in Acts chapter 17 verse
[1:03:04] 29 he's he's uh given his address I
[1:03:06] believe it's on Mars Hill and when he
[1:03:08] gives this address he to the people he
[1:03:10] talks to the people there he tells them
[1:03:13] these idolatrous he says for as much
[1:03:15] then as we're The Offspring of God we
[1:03:18] ought not to think that the God has a
[1:03:20] godhead is likened to gold or silver or
[1:03:22] stone Graven by Art in man's device in
[1:03:25] other words the godhead is not a theory
[1:03:27] right right the Trinity is a
[1:03:30] theory right but the godhead is not a
[1:03:32] theory he said the godhead is not
[1:03:34] something you made up it's not it's not
[1:03:37] what you tried to figure out the godhead
[1:03:39] is a person God was manifested in Jesus
[1:03:43] Christ right but the godheads not a
[1:03:45] theory and he said at the times of this
[1:03:48] ignorance God winked at but now
[1:03:49] commandeth all men everywhere to repent
[1:03:53] bom talked about how through the
[1:03:54] denominational ages winked at that uh
[1:03:57] that baptism entitles but now he calls
[1:03:59] for every man to
[1:04:02] repent and and Paul says because he has
[1:04:04] appointed a day in which he will judge
[1:04:06] the world in righteousness by that man
[1:04:09] whom he hath ordained what will be
[1:04:10] judged by by the word right that's who
[1:04:13] he is by that man by Christ by the word
[1:04:16] whom Heath ordained whereof Heath given
[1:04:18] Assurance unto all men and that Heath
[1:04:20] raised him from the dead brother B said
[1:04:22] he goes on he doesn't Reserve his
[1:04:24] criticism only for trinitarians but he
[1:04:27] said you Jesus only people just using
[1:04:30] the name Jesus for baptism he said I'm
[1:04:32] personally acquinted with four or five
[1:04:34] jesuses myself he said so you see what
[1:04:37] your denominations lead you into that's
[1:04:39] the darkness the expression of Cain who
[1:04:42] brought fruits in the state of blood and
[1:04:43] you know I would be tempted to say well
[1:04:45] it doesn't really matter right Jesus
[1:04:48] Jesus Christ but brother B said it did
[1:04:51] right because baptism is what gets you
[1:04:53] started that's your very found found
[1:04:55] ation of faith and it's got to be in the
[1:04:58] name of Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus
[1:05:00] Christ why because uh it is what it's
[1:05:04] what baptized you into uh it's it's it's
[1:05:07] your public Testament that you're
[1:05:08] baptized into him you have become part
[1:05:11] of that word now uh when in Peter on the
[1:05:14] day of Pentecost of course he said
[1:05:16] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:05:18] the remission of sins you shall receive
[1:05:20] the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul with the
[1:05:23] Philippian Jailer in Acts 16 he brought
[1:05:25] the Mountain said s what must I do to be
[1:05:27] saved and they said believe on what on
[1:05:30] the Lord Jesus Christ they told him who
[1:05:32] they were talking about not just Jesus
[1:05:34] but the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be
[1:05:37] saved in thy house Bram taught us that
[1:05:40] either Jesus Christ or Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:42] was appropriate because he he said he
[1:05:44] used Lord because he is our Lord that's
[1:05:47] just saying who he
[1:05:48] is listen his blood was God's Blood
[1:05:53] Brother BR said the Revelation come
[1:05:55] through the blood
[1:05:56] see through Jesus Christ who is the
[1:05:59] blood of God created blood in the womb
[1:06:02] of Mary where does he get that from and
[1:06:05] I know there's people in the message
[1:06:06] who'll fight you on that because they
[1:06:08] believe that uh Jesus was not really God
[1:06:11] but yet we know we know that his blood
[1:06:13] was God's blood and he took that from
[1:06:15] the scripture where Paul is warning the
[1:06:18] the people the ministry there in Acts 20
[1:06:20] he said take heed to yourselves to the
[1:06:22] flock over which the Holy Ghost have
[1:06:24] made you overseers to the Church of God
[1:06:26] which he had purchased with his own
[1:06:28] blood listen what did he purchase it
[1:06:30] with his own blood who did God did right
[1:06:35] so it's the blood of
[1:06:37] God now brother Bon said Paul knew him
[1:06:40] by Revelation he said that's how we know
[1:06:43] him today it's only the only way we
[1:06:44] could know him not say I'm Methodist
[1:06:47] that means nothing I'm Baptist that
[1:06:49] means nothing I'm Catholic that means
[1:06:51] nothing I go to Word of Life Tabernacle
[1:06:53] doesn't mean anything it it'll identify
[1:06:56] where you go to church but that's about
[1:06:58] it right the Devil comes here
[1:07:00] too right and that that's just he's just
[1:07:03] a spirit but he comes he attends every
[1:07:05] message church right to try to try to
[1:07:08] disrupt and do those things but but
[1:07:11] that's not I go to brother so and so
[1:07:13] church that's not enough but by the
[1:07:14] Revelation that God has revealed the
[1:07:17] word to you he is the word and the word
[1:07:21] how you know it's revealed it lives
[1:07:23] itself and expresses hisself
[1:07:26] through you oh that's good sir he said
[1:07:29] churches has long forgotten that great
[1:07:31] Revelation they've forgotten it now he
[1:07:33] said when Luther raised up he was a
[1:07:35] great man he had the Revelation that day
[1:07:37] what happened a bunch of Ricky got in
[1:07:39] flat top haircuts as we call it today
[1:07:41] Rett is all of them they got around
[1:07:44] there and the first thing you know it's
[1:07:45] there now we we don't think much about
[1:07:47] flat top haircuts today because that's
[1:07:50] kind of a thing of the past but brother
[1:07:51] random had a real problem with it and
[1:07:54] the reason he did is because it was the
[1:07:55] culture of that age the brandom had a
[1:07:57] huge problem with the names Ricky and
[1:08:00] Elvis a huge problem with it and and
[1:08:03] there's a reason why and you can find
[1:08:06] many more quotes like this but I'll I'll
[1:08:09] pull this one in the brand said that
[1:08:11] expression this is again from chrisis
[1:08:13] the mystery he said if you only knew the
[1:08:14] numerology of the Bible and know what
[1:08:17] Elvis or Ricky means to the scripture he
[1:08:19] said just like why did Jesus you say
[1:08:21] there's nothing to your name there isn't
[1:08:23] that name could only come in this last
[1:08:25] days for this last day's people brother
[1:08:27] B doesn't just say that in one place he
[1:08:29] says that over and over and over
[1:08:31] again and and I think it's
[1:08:34] important that we understand why because
[1:08:38] Ricky Nelson how many know who Ricky
[1:08:40] Nelson is all old people sorry I didn't
[1:08:44] mean to call you old my mom raised her
[1:08:45] hand sister Luella in different ones
[1:08:47] some of y'all knew who Ricky Nelson is
[1:08:50] and because y'all were young real young
[1:08:52] when Ricky Nelson was around but Ricky I
[1:08:55] had to look him up cuz I didn't know who
[1:08:57] Ricky Nelson was and brother random will
[1:09:00] use Ricky Nel Nelson and Elvis Presley
[1:09:02] together and then he'll use one other
[1:09:04] person you may know who it is Pat Boon
[1:09:08] that's right so Ricky Nelson Elvis
[1:09:10] Presley and Pat Boon I never knew why
[1:09:12] used Pat Boon brother I heard brother uh
[1:09:14] brother Bisal say one time he was
[1:09:16] listening to the uh to the radio when uh
[1:09:20] Elvis died and it was Pat Boon's voice
[1:09:23] on the radio come across the radio and
[1:09:25] said the king is dead and so he began to
[1:09:27] recognize that they were all together
[1:09:29] because he didn't understand cuz Pat
[1:09:31] Boon seemed like a cleancut kind of guy
[1:09:33] compared to them other guys but Ricky
[1:09:35] and Elvis were the
[1:09:37] trendsetters they were the very first of
[1:09:40] that rock and roll
[1:09:42] generation and brother brandom saw
[1:09:44] something in that he he saw something
[1:09:47] starting would corrupt The American
[1:09:50] Nation to what it is today brother
[1:09:52] Brandon in another place he said we find
[1:09:54] out that they set the
[1:09:57] pace that's right they set the pace he
[1:10:01] said did you ever notice our young boys
[1:10:03] has become Ricky and Elvis He said you
[1:10:05] got a child name that change it name
[1:10:07] that change it right quick call him
[1:10:09] number one or two or
[1:10:12] something you say what difference does
[1:10:15] the name mean he said well I sure it
[1:10:17] means something your name characterizes
[1:10:20] your life he said now brother BR you're
[1:10:22] on numerology no I'm not I'm on thus
[1:10:24] sayith the Lord
[1:10:26] because why he has scripture Abram was
[1:10:29] changed to Abraham Sarah to Sarah Jacob
[1:10:32] to Israel Simon to Peter Saul to Paul
[1:10:36] numerous numerous uh instances where God
[1:10:40] personally changes the name of an
[1:10:43] individual from something that was uh
[1:10:46] was not what they should be to what he
[1:10:48] wanted them to be and so brother brand
[1:10:50] says Ricky and Elvis and such names as
[1:10:52] that he said is the modern American name
[1:10:55] which throws a child automatically right
[1:10:59] into that what is it it's it's today we
[1:11:02] have different Heroes right we need to
[1:11:05] watch what we name our kids still we we
[1:11:07] wouldn't name our kids Ricky or Elvis
[1:11:09] but maybe some other hero that we have
[1:11:11] out there somewhere but it throws them
[1:11:13] under that influence right of that
[1:11:16] because those were the trends Setters of
[1:11:18] that day we need to be careful we need
[1:11:19] to make sure that our children are
[1:11:21] raised right now brother brandom
[1:11:23] identifies something in that they were
[1:11:25] saids they started something he said you
[1:11:28] say there's nothing to it he said why
[1:11:30] did Jesus Chang Abram's name to Abraham
[1:11:32] and then Sarah to Sarah why did he
[1:11:34] change Saul to Paul why did he change
[1:11:35] Simon to Peter and so forth you see
[1:11:37] certainly it means something he said
[1:11:39] that name could not be spoken till this
[1:11:41] day that's astounding isn't it he said
[1:11:44] that's the reason we got this hellish
[1:11:46] thing we got in the Earth today because
[1:11:48] of such
[1:11:49] things brother BR seeing something that
[1:11:51] we weren't seeing as a prophet now let
[1:11:54] me let me say this you got to believe
[1:11:56] something I'd rather believe the words
[1:11:58] of a prophet and I'll say this if
[1:12:00] brother bam sees something in that I
[1:12:03] don't see I'm I'm going to listen to it
[1:12:06] right but I do see that it was a trend
[1:12:08] setting and there was something that
[1:12:10] started there and that's what he was
[1:12:12] concerned with now he said that's the
[1:12:14] reason we got this hellish sh we got the
[1:12:16] Earth today because of such things he
[1:12:17] said the whole human race is corrupted
[1:12:19] it's gone he said and that's why it is
[1:12:22] he said notice now he was all right he
[1:12:25] was in his days Luther and he had the
[1:12:27] Revelation but as soon as he left look
[1:12:28] what they did as they had a message look
[1:12:31] what it did he said the old early
[1:12:33] Pentecostal had a message look what they
[1:12:34] did they got a bunch of men together
[1:12:36] just exactly the same thing and brother
[1:12:38] brand types begins to type the
[1:12:40] denomination to
[1:12:42] Israel and and this is where I want to
[1:12:43] go tonight he talked about him choosing
[1:12:46] law over Grace how many have heard
[1:12:49] brother Bram sermon the church choosing
[1:12:51] law for Grace many of you have heard
[1:12:54] that the church it's a good one to
[1:12:56] listen to the church choosing law for
[1:12:57] Grace he said they actually chose to
[1:13:01] have a denomination instead of relying
[1:13:04] upon the grace of God and following the
[1:13:06] pillar of fire they chose law in other
[1:13:10] words he was saying Israel didn't have
[1:13:11] to have the law that they did but they
[1:13:15] chose that so he said God by Grace sent
[1:13:18] Israel a pillar of fire a prophet a
[1:13:20] sacrifice and showed himself among them
[1:13:23] brought them out of Egypt across the red
[1:13:25] SE seas and they wanted a law so they
[1:13:27] could have great dignitaries now what
[1:13:29] was their motivation they wanted a
[1:13:32] hierarchy they could have something to
[1:13:34] do into it and what did they do they was
[1:13:36] left in the wilderness for 40 years to
[1:13:38] wander and not one of that organization
[1:13:41] ever went over he said Caleb and Joshua
[1:13:43] the only two that stood out and said
[1:13:45] we're able to take it I love the way he
[1:13:47] puts this to look at the word of God
[1:13:50] don't let anybody tell you that you
[1:13:51] can't look at the word of God we're able
[1:13:54] to take it to we're able to look at the
[1:13:55] word of God in fact the book's been open
[1:13:58] in our day we're able to there's nothing
[1:14:01] in this message we should be afraid of
[1:14:04] we shouldn't be afraid to preach it we
[1:14:06] shouldn't be afraid to believe it we
[1:14:08] shouldn't be afraid to manifest it right
[1:14:10] because it's the light of the hour so he
[1:14:13] said we're able to take it every one of
[1:14:14] them died in the wilderness and Jesus
[1:14:16] said they were eternally gone after he
[1:14:19] showed his blessings and Power in their
[1:14:20] ages like Luther Wesley and so forth did
[1:14:23] he he said our fathers eat man in the
[1:14:25] Wilderness he said and they're everyone
[1:14:26] dead he said that's eternally separated
[1:14:29] from God the carcasses perished in the
[1:14:31] wilderness they're dead he said but I'm
[1:14:33] the bread of life that come from God out
[1:14:34] of Heaven they couldn't see it they just
[1:14:37] couldn't see it he said the church has
[1:14:39] long forgotten it they accepted
[1:14:41] intellectual message intellectuals
[1:14:43] membership knowledge instead of the
[1:14:45] revelation of the truth of the word he
[1:14:47] said now look here now he's going to
[1:14:49] give an example of that they say today
[1:14:51] do you believe that God commissioned us
[1:14:52] to go into all the world and heal the
[1:14:54] sick and preached the gospel and cast
[1:14:56] out Devils oh yes I suppose that's right
[1:14:59] but he said you see he said a lady
[1:15:02] talking to me the other day she said
[1:15:03] well all the churches are in harmony I
[1:15:05] said there isn't one of them in harmony
[1:15:06] with the other there's Catholics
[1:15:08] standing there and said how about you
[1:15:09] you're a Methodist that's a Catholic are
[1:15:11] you are you in harmony with one another
[1:15:13] I said this Pope come to unite them
[1:15:15] together that's a good thing for all
[1:15:16] that kind of people but the Church of
[1:15:18] God has nothing to do with it not the
[1:15:20] thing it's out from the whole bunch he
[1:15:22] said you want to unite that together One
[1:15:24] Believes In something the other
[1:15:25] Methodist take sprinkling the Baptist
[1:15:27] take immersion and both of them denying
[1:15:30] the Holy Ghost in his fullness of the
[1:15:31] power they said we received the Holy
[1:15:33] Ghost when we believe the Bible said
[1:15:35] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:15:37] you believed he said there's the
[1:15:39] difference now what is that what's he
[1:15:41] showing us whatever the word says is
[1:15:43] right why because the word has the
[1:15:47] preeminence and and we kind of lose
[1:15:49] sight of this stuff and we think well it
[1:15:51] really doesn't matter but isn't that the
[1:15:52] work of the enemy in our day to tell us
[1:15:55] that well it really doesn't matter it
[1:15:56] does
[1:15:58] matter so he said they said we're the
[1:16:01] Catholic church and we started early we
[1:16:03] did this the Methodist say we're based
[1:16:05] on the Bible Jesus said these signs
[1:16:07] shall follow them that believe he said
[1:16:09] now where is it at see the works that I
[1:16:12] do shall you do also he said every
[1:16:15] creature every person that believes in
[1:16:16] him he said now where is it at that's
[1:16:18] his words heavens and earth will pass
[1:16:21] away but my words shall never fail he
[1:16:24] said now where is that D he said oh it
[1:16:25] just shows you see it's not enough to
[1:16:27] just say
[1:16:28] it we've got to be the
[1:16:31] church we can't just talk about being
[1:16:33] the church we got to be the church we
[1:16:35] got to be the bride we've got to become
[1:16:37] that we we we're pressing into something
[1:16:39] where and that's why there sometimes
[1:16:41] there's you say well if I went down to
[1:16:43] the Baptist Church or some other church
[1:16:44] maybe I wouldn't have any stress and
[1:16:46] they'd just always tell me how broken I
[1:16:48] was and and I'd be okay no we're pushing
[1:16:50] into something yes we were broken but
[1:16:53] we've been made whole by the message of
[1:16:55] the hour we're becoming something we're
[1:16:57] not we don't we're not content with
[1:16:59] being left alone sir but we want to be
[1:17:01] changed we want to be different we want
[1:17:03] to be new because we want to go to a
[1:17:05] better world a better place we're not
[1:17:07] putting all our eggs in this
[1:17:09] basket right we're not planning on
[1:17:12] staying here but the greatest portion of
[1:17:14] our life is going to be somewhere else
[1:17:16] in a better
[1:17:18] place oh church you've only got so long
[1:17:21] to
[1:17:22] live all of us do I'm I
[1:17:26] I won't even say my age some of you
[1:17:27] Elders probably get mad at me cuz I'm
[1:17:29] not old but I'll say this I begin to
[1:17:32] think about the years and I think my
[1:17:33] goodness it just seemed went like that
[1:17:36] yeah and then you look you begin to year
[1:17:38] adds to year it adds to year and you
[1:17:40] look back at your life and you begin to
[1:17:41] think I better do
[1:17:44] something before it's too late but look
[1:17:46] this is the small part and none of us
[1:17:49] can
[1:17:50] avoid meeting our end we'll either go by
[1:17:53] a grave of the rapture
[1:17:55] so we might as well press into something
[1:17:58] better we might as well keep up the
[1:18:00] fight we might as well pick up our
[1:18:02] swords and and fight for every promise
[1:18:04] of the word of God not leave one stone
[1:18:07] unturned we we only got a certain amount
[1:18:09] of time to live why would we remain
[1:18:10] label to see why would we sit back and
[1:18:13] say well I'm just going to coast in I'm
[1:18:15] going to r no let's grab a hold of the
[1:18:17] promises of God let's do what God said
[1:18:20] we can do let's be what God said we can
[1:18:23] be oh if the church church can be on
[1:18:25] Fire Let's be on fire if we can if we
[1:18:28] can live for God with all of our we can
[1:18:30] love God with all of our heart soul and
[1:18:31] mind let's do that if God said we can
[1:18:34] forgive one another let's forgive one
[1:18:35] another let's go on let's move on into
[1:18:37] the promises of God are you with me
[1:18:41] tonight now these signs shall follow
[1:18:44] them to believe whatever he said that's
[1:18:47] what we want to do he said now where is
[1:18:49] it at that's his words heavens and earth
[1:18:50] will pass away my words will never fail
[1:18:53] he said now where is it that see oh it
[1:18:55] just shows what is it's a hybrid
[1:18:57] condition he said look here you take a
[1:18:59] big fine grain of corn that's hybrid you
[1:19:02] take that hybrid corn it's pretty corn
[1:19:05] but it only lasts one
[1:19:06] generation but you play it what do you
[1:19:09] get a little stalk comes up like this
[1:19:11] and turns yellow and wils down he said
[1:19:14] that's the way every denomination is
[1:19:15] when it's hybrid the man's words mixed
[1:19:17] with God's words it'll come up to the
[1:19:20] signs and wonders what Jesus said about
[1:19:21] believing the word and it turns yellow
[1:19:23] and so we can't accept accept it and
[1:19:25] goes
[1:19:26] back oh my oh I don't want to turn
[1:19:29] yellow do you that shows what we are
[1:19:32] it's it's how we how we respond when
[1:19:34] we're planted and what grows out of our
[1:19:37] life listen he said just like all them
[1:19:38] other spies did that went and looked at
[1:19:40] Cain and they come over there and said
[1:19:42] oh we look like grasshoppers aside of
[1:19:43] them we can't take them he said the
[1:19:46] amalekites will all these what what
[1:19:48] they're going to do and they went back
[1:19:49] and Caleb and Joshua being
[1:19:51] thoroughbreds amen by the word of God oh
[1:19:54] my thorough breads I like that sir I
[1:19:57] like that my have you ever watch you
[1:20:00] ever watch a good thorough bread
[1:20:02] run it was born to run right you ever
[1:20:06] watch you want to see something
[1:20:08] inspiring I don't say you should watch
[1:20:09] horse racing but if you've ever watched
[1:20:11] on YouTube Secretariat win the Belmont
[1:20:14] Stakes in in the 1970s Secretariat was a
[1:20:17] great horse and he was spread to do that
[1:20:20] all down through his bloodline he was
[1:20:21] the maybe the greatest horse that ever
[1:20:23] lived and he could run he could run and
[1:20:26] and why it was just in his jeans to run
[1:20:29] when all the other horses were just
[1:20:30] about done he just getting started he
[1:20:33] would stay in the back until the close
[1:20:35] to the end he' just pass everybody up
[1:20:37] and run right past them why he was
[1:20:39] bigger than everybody else he's faster
[1:20:40] than everybody he was a thorough bread
[1:20:41] he was bred to do that he was born to do
[1:20:44] oh Church don't you realize that's you
[1:20:46] and I today we were born to do what
[1:20:48] we're doing we were born to defeat Satan
[1:20:51] we were born to take the land we were
[1:20:53] born to be more than conqueror do you
[1:20:55] believe that tonight we were born to do
[1:20:57] that sir Caleb and Joshua were
[1:20:59] thoroughbreds by the word of God no God
[1:21:02] said I give you that land they said
[1:21:04] we're more than able to take it why they
[1:21:06] were born to do it amen and brother B
[1:21:09] said it depends on where you're born
[1:21:11] from if you're born of the word of God
[1:21:13] God's word has the
[1:21:25] he said let the word of God shine forth
[1:21:27] first no matter what anybody else look
[1:21:30] anything else looks like he said I don't
[1:21:32] care if the intellectual says this that
[1:21:33] or the other it has nothing to do with
[1:21:35] it God's word said so we are more than
[1:21:37] able to take it don't let the devil beat
[1:21:40] you up and say well I can't be what God
[1:21:41] said I could be you can be everything
[1:21:44] God said you could
[1:21:46] be if God said you can live right you
[1:21:49] can live right if God said you could you
[1:21:51] could be healed you can be healed God
[1:21:54] said you can you can worship Him you can
[1:21:56] worship him let God's word be a lie and
[1:21:58] every or every man's word be a lie and
[1:22:00] let God's word be
[1:22:02] true do you believe that
[1:22:04] tonight look he said has nothing to do
[1:22:08] with God's word said so we're more than
[1:22:09] able to take it if I preach that in my
[1:22:11] church a minister told me I'd be
[1:22:12] preaching to four posts in the church I
[1:22:14] said I'd preach to that we got more than
[1:22:17] four posts in here
[1:22:19] tonight right I said I'd preach you that
[1:22:22] yes sir God's word said so we can do it
[1:22:24] God said do it oh yeah he said they
[1:22:27] excuse themselves by this they excuse
[1:22:30] themselves by this see that's why
[1:22:33] they're blind to the message of the end
[1:22:34] time this last days when God is proving
[1:22:37] himself they try to class it as some
[1:22:39] kind of a spiritist or what I call it
[1:22:41] some mental illusion something on that
[1:22:43] order see they try to make it something
[1:22:45] that it isn't and Satan hasn't stopped
[1:22:48] they were doing that back in brother
[1:22:49] Brandon's time they're still doing it
[1:22:52] some some people you know just recently
[1:22:54] discovered all this nonsense on the
[1:22:55] internet and and it just blows their
[1:22:57] mind it's like that stuff's been there
[1:22:58] for a long time they just didn't have an
[1:23:01] internet to spread it but that stuff's
[1:23:04] been out there ever since I've been
[1:23:05] alive and and and evidently back in
[1:23:07] brother brandom's time they tried to say
[1:23:09] it was be's abub but they did that's
[1:23:10] Jesus
[1:23:11] too right they said he's a fortune
[1:23:14] teller he he got a devil right but they
[1:23:17] said some kind of mental telepathy when
[1:23:19] they know he can stand there and look
[1:23:21] upon the people and discern the very
[1:23:23] thoughts that's in their heart
[1:23:25] the Bible said so he said does not
[1:23:26] Hebrews the 4th chapter say the word of
[1:23:28] God is quicker and sharper than a
[1:23:30] two-edged sword can discern the very
[1:23:32] thoughts of the mind and he was that
[1:23:34] word I love this and when that word is
[1:23:37] preeminence in the man the same thing
[1:23:41] takes place again for the word what's he
[1:23:44] telling us Church the fact that he was
[1:23:46] standing there and God was using his
[1:23:48] body to do that meant the word and come
[1:23:51] back in preeminence again right but what
[1:23:54] does that mean it means that the word
[1:23:56] can be in preeminence in me it can be in
[1:23:59] preeminence in you now it won't make you
[1:24:01] discern what'll it make you do it'll
[1:24:02] make you become whatever part of the
[1:24:04] body you
[1:24:05] are are you with me now you won't be a
[1:24:08] prophet to the age we've already had the
[1:24:10] prophet to the age we don't need a
[1:24:12] prophet to the age but we do need a
[1:24:13] deacon we do need trustees we do need
[1:24:15] young people we do need Housewives we do
[1:24:18] need prayer warriors we do need we do
[1:24:21] need
[1:24:21] testimonies we do need people who live
[1:24:24] for God we do need people who who are
[1:24:27] firmly established on the word of God
[1:24:29] and what is that whatever part of the
[1:24:31] body you are you'll become that you have
[1:24:33] a potential because Christ has the
[1:24:35] preeminence again oh my let's not take
[1:24:39] that lightly
[1:24:41] Church the fact that that happened for
[1:24:43] the first time and at some point I want
[1:24:45] to go into that son of man ministry
[1:24:47] again but we we we don't want to take
[1:24:49] that lightly it's important when the
[1:24:52] same thing takes place again it shows
[1:24:54] the preeminence is in the
[1:24:56] man amen he said see how you can how can
[1:24:59] you stumble over this from now on he
[1:25:01] said there is so perfectly plain yes sir
[1:25:03] he said that's why they're blind same as
[1:25:05] it was in the days Christ was on earth
[1:25:06] oh my they stagger the same way they
[1:25:08] said he's be above they seen he could do
[1:25:10] it so they said he was born an
[1:25:12] illegitimate child kind of an Odd Fellow
[1:25:14] just possessed with some Devil he's
[1:25:16] Samaritan over there he's got a Devil in
[1:25:17] him that's how he does that and Jesus
[1:25:19] said I'll forgive you for that see
[1:25:21] calling the word of God the works of God
[1:25:23] an evil spirit he he said I'll forgive
[1:25:24] you for that but someday the Holy Ghost
[1:25:27] will come you believe he's here and one
[1:25:29] word against it will never be forgiven
[1:25:31] either in this world the world that is
[1:25:32] to come or that on or that great day he
[1:25:34] said it will not be forgiven so you see
[1:25:36] that's written plain in the scripture he
[1:25:39] said so when people come to that day no
[1:25:40] matter how intellectual how big a
[1:25:42] denomination they belong to it's
[1:25:43] condemned they have to be they
[1:25:45] blasphemed the Holy Ghost calling it
[1:25:46] Holy Roller something another had an
[1:25:48] untasty name or something like that he
[1:25:50] said God's church had to Bear it all the
[1:25:52] time I'll say this don't call don't mock
[1:25:54] The Works of
[1:25:56] God even if you don't understand
[1:25:59] something don't mock
[1:26:00] it even if it may have some somebody
[1:26:03] gets in the flesh don't mock
[1:26:05] it because if we mock it we get in
[1:26:08] trouble and we might be mocking
[1:26:11] God we need to be careful with that
[1:26:13] don't mock it let it become what it
[1:26:14] becomes because you'll see the fruit of
[1:26:16] it in the
[1:26:17] end right just follow the word follow
[1:26:20] the word but don't mock any
[1:26:21] manifestation of God because it might be
[1:26:25] might be God revealed revealing himself
[1:26:28] now
[1:26:29] look he and God's church has always been
[1:26:33] blasphemed and he said he said they
[1:26:35] blasphemed the Holy Ghost calling a holy
[1:26:37] roll or something another like that he
[1:26:39] said God's church had to Bear it all the
[1:26:41] time so we're still going to have to
[1:26:43] bear that it's just part of it we're
[1:26:45] going to have to bear it until we leave
[1:26:47] here there's going to be people that
[1:26:49] come against the message of the hour and
[1:26:51] I'll ask you why are they not
[1:26:52] persecuting the Catholics
[1:26:54] why are they not coming down on the
[1:26:55] Methodist they're coming down on the
[1:26:56] message why because it's
[1:26:59] true right and they're going to come
[1:27:00] against the truth it just ought to firm
[1:27:03] us up in our hearts that much more it's
[1:27:06] always going to be there we don't try to
[1:27:07] hide it it's there but it doesn't change
[1:27:10] what God Said now look he said God's
[1:27:13] church had to Bear it all the time even
[1:27:14] Paul before a grip said in the way is
[1:27:16] called heresy which means crazy that's
[1:27:20] the way I worship the god of our fathers
[1:27:22] a great intellectual scholar had to come
[1:27:24] to that place in the way that's called
[1:27:25] heresy why it was revealed to him that
[1:27:28] Pillar of Fire hanging before him said I
[1:27:30] am Jesus the great God was in the
[1:27:32] wilderness y with Moses I'm he and it's
[1:27:34] hard for you to kick against the bricks
[1:27:35] listen the reason why it's so hard for
[1:27:37] some people you know if you got a
[1:27:40] revelation of who Christ is the word and
[1:27:43] that it's right it won't be hard for you
[1:27:45] to not cut your hair if you're a
[1:27:47] woman right it's not going to be hard
[1:27:50] why not because you want to fit in but
[1:27:53] because you believe the word is right
[1:27:55] and if the pastor and everybody else
[1:27:57] started doing it right you wouldn't do
[1:27:59] it because you got a
[1:28:01] revelation it's not because somebody
[1:28:03] beats you over the head with it and and
[1:28:06] many times we we have these conflicts
[1:28:07] and things in our life because there's
[1:28:09] just a lack of Revelation what we need
[1:28:12] is to a revelation that the word is
[1:28:14] right and if we get a revelation of who
[1:28:17] he is in the word those things will
[1:28:18] begin to begin to come around right and
[1:28:22] so I don't condemn somebody for
[1:28:23] struggling with that that but you you
[1:28:25] need a revelation you need to know the
[1:28:28] message is true listen we're in an age
[1:28:31] where you you got you're going to have
[1:28:32] to know that it's right or you're not
[1:28:33] going to make
[1:28:34] it because the church will have ups and
[1:28:36] downs and if you depend on the ups and
[1:28:39] downs in the church to make it say well
[1:28:42] as long as things are going good I'm
[1:28:43] doing good you're going to be
[1:28:46] disappointed right and things are going
[1:28:47] to happen you're going to fall away we
[1:28:49] don't go by feelings we don't go by our
[1:28:51] own feelings we don't go by the pastor's
[1:28:53] feelings we don't go by the song leaders
[1:28:55] feelings what do we go by the
[1:28:57] word right the word is still true even
[1:29:00] if I'm the only one that believes it but
[1:29:02] I believe you won't be the only ones
[1:29:03] God's given us friends and and brothers
[1:29:06] and sisters in a church to that we love
[1:29:08] one another but but if we're the only
[1:29:10] ones that believe it it's still
[1:29:11] true but still I'm going to worship him
[1:29:14] in the way that's called heresy he said
[1:29:16] that's the way that's called heresy
[1:29:17] that's the way I worship the God my
[1:29:19] fathers he said today people say it's a
[1:29:22] denomination he said it's Jesus Christ
[1:29:24] New Birth revealed in you I love that
[1:29:27] it's Jesus Christ the new birth I'm
[1:29:29] almost done listen to me now the new
[1:29:32] birth revealed in you that he has the
[1:29:36] pinenes that he might Express his
[1:29:41] words he didn't say he didn't say the
[1:29:44] new birth revealed in me that I might
[1:29:47] Express his words right he wasn't
[1:29:49] talking about himself he was talking
[1:29:51] about the bride right the bride is going
[1:29:54] to have something to say you got
[1:29:56] something to say to the world that you
[1:29:58] live in you young people you got
[1:30:00] something to say to the world you're
[1:30:02] living in you young married couples you
[1:30:04] got something to say something to prove
[1:30:06] sir you are his proof you young ladies
[1:30:09] you got something to prove you to the
[1:30:11] world that you're living in all of you
[1:30:13] you you widows that struggle and go
[1:30:15] through the time that you go through but
[1:30:17] yet you got something to prove you're
[1:30:19] going to make it God kept a widow before
[1:30:21] if he could do it back then he can do it
[1:30:23] today
[1:30:25] oh my if he's kept those that are poor
[1:30:26] if he's kept those that are that that
[1:30:29] are needy if he's kept those that are
[1:30:30] tired and given strength to the weak he
[1:30:33] can do it again and if that promis is in
[1:30:36] the Bible I am more than able to take it
[1:30:39] I am more than able you are more than
[1:30:41] able what is it he wants to reveal he
[1:30:43] wants to speak through you he wants to
[1:30:46] express his word in
[1:30:49] you now think about
[1:30:52] this you know the devil tells you you
[1:30:54] can't pay your
[1:30:55] ti but every time you do you're
[1:30:58] expressing the word of Christ not
[1:31:01] because I need your money or want your
[1:31:02] money but because that's what the Bible
[1:31:05] says are you with me now every time oh
[1:31:10] my every time you come to the house of
[1:31:12] God through opposition through struggle
[1:31:16] when it's hard when you got a long drive
[1:31:18] every time you make it to the house of
[1:31:20] God sometimes your body's hurting or the
[1:31:22] kids are all crying and you say why did
[1:31:24] we even come what are you doing you're
[1:31:26] expressing the word of God it said not
[1:31:28] forsaking the Assembly of yourself
[1:31:30] together you're speaking that from your
[1:31:33] life when you don't give
[1:31:35] up are you with me now when when you're
[1:31:38] pushed to the Limit but you don't give
[1:31:40] up when you when when you're so bound it
[1:31:43] seem like it's so tired and so weary but
[1:31:45] you worship Him Anyway amen oh when you
[1:31:48] do that you're expressing the word where
[1:31:50] he said praise him all every let
[1:31:52] everything that hath breath praise the
[1:31:53] Lord
[1:31:54] oh I want to be an expression of that
[1:31:56] word today that's an expression you're
[1:31:59] an expression of God's word I may not
[1:32:02] feel like it you may not feel like it
[1:32:03] but we're not here because we feel like
[1:32:05] it we're here because he wants to
[1:32:07] express
[1:32:08] himself through US whenever you show
[1:32:10] love to a member of the body of Christ
[1:32:12] that's right you're
[1:32:14] expressing the word in your
[1:32:16] life oh my that's what I want to do I
[1:32:20] want to express the word and my God
[1:32:22] helped me to do that as a Pastor look he
[1:32:25] might Express his word let's not take
[1:32:27] this slightly church it's important he
[1:32:29] said and anything someone say
[1:32:32] anything anything that he's promised in
[1:32:34] this last days he can bring it to pass
[1:32:38] but he doesn't stop there through his
[1:32:41] body as he's
[1:32:44] working I love that how does he do it
[1:32:47] through his body you see I don't need
[1:32:48] the body of Christ well it seems like we
[1:32:50] do right he's bringing his words to pass
[1:32:53] through his body
[1:32:55] as he's working he said it's just
[1:32:57] exactly the word of God made
[1:33:01] manifest what does that mean it means
[1:33:03] every promise in the book is mine it's
[1:33:07] all
[1:33:09] possible I'm always struck as musicians
[1:33:11] come to I'm always struck by the
[1:33:13] possibility of every service it's
[1:33:17] possible yes sir steart I don't know
[1:33:20] about you but I know as a minister I I
[1:33:21] look for that I look for that because
[1:33:24] might be a service where a child is
[1:33:27] born it's the kind of expectation that
[1:33:30] you have when a when a woman is is it's
[1:33:32] far along if your wife if you're married
[1:33:34] and you got you've had children you know
[1:33:36] right right when she was nine months you
[1:33:37] know and and you know that that baby
[1:33:39] could be born any day it it was a
[1:33:42] possibility every day you wake up today
[1:33:44] could be the day there's possibility I'm
[1:33:47] struck by that every time we come to the
[1:33:48] house of God there's a possibility cuz I
[1:33:51] know people are sick but there's a
[1:33:53] possibility of
[1:33:54] healing why because every promise is
[1:33:57] possible sir Hallelujah there's a
[1:34:00] possibility we play the goodness of God
[1:34:03] the possibility I think it's in C the
[1:34:06] possibility is that you could be
[1:34:10] delivered it's possible if we can just
[1:34:13] make ourselves believe that it's
[1:34:15] possible if it don't happen today I'm
[1:34:17] going to believe it tomorrow if it don't
[1:34:18] happen tomorrow I'm going to believe it
[1:34:20] the next day it's still
[1:34:22] possible you want to know what else is
[1:34:24] possible a body change sister Jackie one
[1:34:26] of these days we're going to walk out of
[1:34:28] this body into another body that's
[1:34:30] possible in this
[1:34:33] service hallelujah it's possible in the
[1:34:36] morning it's possible tomorrow it's
[1:34:38] possible the next day what is it he's
[1:34:41] here he's proved that he's here he's
[1:34:43] speaking through his bride in spite of
[1:34:46] Leal we're still here we're still
[1:34:48] speaking we're still working what is it

[1:34:56] take him at his word worship him in this
[1:34:58] place as if we were already in that
