[38:54] holies to hear your word Lord Lord we
[38:57] want everything else shut off we want to
[38:59] hear from you
[39:01] I pray God that the right atmosphere
[39:03] would be set Lord
[39:05] and that it would be real to us
[39:09] help us father to put aside everything
[39:12] else or maybe there'd be some sickness
[39:14] or something that we're going through or
[39:17] we could just put that aside for a while
[39:19] and maybe when we come out Lord we'd
[39:22] find that we were healed
[39:23] all of our needs were men I pray that it
[39:27] would be so Lord
[39:28] pray you would open up our spiritual
[39:30] understanding may we be Lord mature
[39:33] grown Christians as we walk with you
[39:36] until that day we walk with you all the
[39:38] way home we thank you for that Lord I
[39:42] Thank you for these people that have
[39:43] gathered on Wednesday night I pray a
[39:46] special blessing for them Lord
[39:48] getting your precious thing amen
[39:52] amen
[39:54] First Corinthians 12 10 and Hebrews 4 12
[39:58] First Corinthians 12 10 in Hebrews
[40:01] 412 I wanted to say happy birthday as
[40:05] well to to Allison and Stuart what a
[40:08] blessing that they are to the church I
[40:10] know that they're watching tonight and
[40:12] it's such a blessing that they've been
[40:15] over the years and just stood by the
[40:18] leadership here in the church and and
[40:20] become leaders in the church I'm
[40:22] thankful for that I'm thankful for you
[40:23] young people brother Danny sometimes as
[40:26] we get older I'll just say it that way
[40:28] it's nice to have young men and women
[40:30] stand up and and in the position that
[40:33] they can fill and do those things and
[40:35] and uh so just say happy birthday to
[40:38] them and kind of need to be married to
[40:40] somebody who's born on the same day you
[40:42] was born on so that's kind of nice but
[40:45] it seems like somebody may have arranged
[40:47] that so uh and then Peter's birthday
[40:50] today and Peter's back there taking care
[40:53] of stuff he's not listening to me right
[40:55] now but that young man
[40:57] does more than what you realize for the
[41:00] services here when you're not able to be
[41:02] here a lot of what we're able to do is
[41:05] because of that young man and and I I
[41:07] give him a hard time all the time I'm
[41:09] hard on him Joel's hard on him and we
[41:11] give him a hard time all the time but
[41:13] Peter I want you to know I appreciate
[41:15] you and what you do here in the church
[41:16] and happy birthday 16 is a big one so
[41:20] that's uh boy about growing up I told
[41:23] him I said after today now your room is
[41:25] going to be clean and you're going to
[41:26] want to mow the yard and and things are
[41:29] just going to be different you know
[41:31] you're all grown up so
[41:33] amen
[41:34] don't you wish it worked that way
[41:37] even for us adults
[41:38] First Corinthians 12 and 10 it says to
[41:41] another the working of Miracles to
[41:43] another prophecy to another Discerning
[41:45] of spirits that's what we want to deal
[41:48] with tonight and then Hebrews 4 and 12
[41:52] for the word of God
[41:54] is quick that's alive
[41:56] and Powerful
[41:58] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[42:02] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[42:05] Soul and Spirit of the joints and Morrow
[42:08] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[42:13] intents
[42:14] of the heart pray the Lord without his
[42:17] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[42:19] I want to speak to you on the Discerning
[42:21] of spirits
[42:23] and discernment in general tonight the
[42:26] word discernment in the Greek is
[42:27] distinguishing distinguishing and
[42:30] deciding or passing sentence on
[42:34] distinguishing and so we have to be able
[42:36] to distinguish the difference between
[42:39] one thing and another that's what
[42:42] discernment is and so in in Webster in
[42:46] 1828 Webster defined discernment as the
[42:50] act of Discerning the power or faculty
[42:53] of the Mind by which it distinguishes
[42:55] one thing from another it distinguishes
[42:57] truth from falsehood virtue from Vice
[43:01] acuteness of judgment power of
[43:04] perceiving differences of things or
[43:06] ideas and their relations and tendencies
[43:10] so we could say it this way tonight A
[43:12] discerner is a judge
[43:16] right everybody understand that to judge
[43:18] so Discerning of spirits is to judge
[43:21] between one spirit and another
[43:24] right and it'll just kind of kind of
[43:26] walk through this tonight so we'll so
[43:28] we'll really get it it's so important to
[43:31] us because we need discernment
[43:34] we need discernment we need the
[43:38] discernment in our life that will allow
[43:40] us to continue to be uh to live like
[43:45] Christians ought to live and and that
[43:47] don't just come although we have
[43:49] discernment if we have the Holy Ghost we
[43:51] have Christian discernment which is one
[43:54] of the the types of discernment so we
[43:56] have discernment but we have to grow in
[43:59] that discernment from the time that
[44:01] we're born again and Paul uses that in
[44:04] Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 13 and I'll
[44:08] say this before we go there there's
[44:10] there's basically three types of
[44:11] discernment
[44:12] the areas of what brother Branham calls
[44:15] a gift of discernment
[44:17] and I think he's identifying that as a
[44:20] gift of discernment because that's what
[44:22] the Pentecostals would understand it as
[44:25] but that's to a prophet
[44:27] that would be a word prophet and we'll
[44:29] get into that in some depth tonight
[44:31] but that's a prophet only
[44:34] that would have that gift and then
[44:37] there's a gift of discerning of spirits
[44:40] and then there's Christian discernment
[44:42] between Good and Evil
[44:43] so it may not be necessarily you have a
[44:46] special gift but it's just something
[44:47] that's in you because the word is in you
[44:50] and you are a discerner the word is a
[44:52] discerner the thoughts and intense of
[44:53] the heart and so Paul puts it this way
[44:55] he said for everyone that useth milk is
[44:57] unskillful unskillful you don't you're
[45:01] not born into the church able to
[45:04] skillfully handle the word
[45:07] right that takes time and don't beat
[45:09] yourself up about that as we talked
[45:11] about Sunday that it takes time to
[45:13] skillfully handle the word and I've
[45:15] found many times that I would take the
[45:18] word and I'd take a certain thought on
[45:20] it but as I grow in my understanding and
[45:22] my ability brother Robert to just be
[45:25] able to handle the word I'll go back and
[45:27] look at that thought and think my
[45:28] there's so much more to it than what I
[45:30] realized before
[45:32] because even even without lay aside
[45:35] gifts and everything else you still have
[45:37] to grow into your discernment when it
[45:40] comes to the word now he said everyone
[45:42] that uses milk is unskilled from the
[45:44] word of righteousness it means he can
[45:46] only handle those things that that are
[45:49] easy
[45:50] right he can't he can't take any any
[45:52] kind of thing that would be hard to
[45:54] digest
[45:55] right right but now he said he's a babe
[45:58] he said but strong meat belongeth to
[46:01] them that are a full age
[46:03] that requires maturity he said even
[46:06] those who by reason of use
[46:09] you know why I don't have muscles I have
[46:13] muscles but
[46:14] not ones you can see because I don't use
[46:17] them enough
[46:18] if I would use them muscles would just
[46:21] come out
[46:22] just start to make themselves known
[46:25] right and discernment is the same way he
[46:28] said by re-faith it's the same way he
[46:31] said by reason of use have their senses
[46:34] exercised
[46:36] and so they that you exercise your
[46:38] senses you used it you you discern you
[46:41] think about it you you get into the word
[46:44] you grow in the word he said by by
[46:46] reason of use have their senses
[46:48] exercised to discern both Good and Evil
[46:52] we need that today
[46:54] you need discernment sometimes where
[46:56] your kids are going to go to school and
[46:58] who their friends are going to be and
[47:00] and who you should marry and and so what
[47:03] car you need to buy it all kinds of
[47:04] different things we need spiritual that
[47:06] applies to our lives
[47:08] that's not just some some concept out
[47:11] here that only prophets can have we need
[47:13] spiritual discernment
[47:15] and spiritual things are spiritually
[47:18] discerned
[47:19] because Paul says the natural man
[47:21] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[47:23] of God
[47:24] for their foolishness unto him neither
[47:26] can he know them because
[47:28] they're what
[47:31] spiritually discerned
[47:33] right now stay with me tonight and then
[47:36] and you're doing good on a Wednesday
[47:38] night he said the fair now the Pharisees
[47:42] Jesus said could not discern the right
[47:44] things
[47:45] he said you can discern the face of the
[47:48] sky and of the Earth
[47:49] but how is it that you do not discern
[47:51] this time
[47:53] and another place he calls it how can
[47:55] you not discern the sign of the time
[47:58] because you you discern the wrong things
[48:00] so we need to discern spiritual things
[48:03] and sober the random deals with that in
[48:05] a message called Discerning of spirits
[48:07] and he's he talks about how that many
[48:09] times we discern the group a man is in
[48:12] and who lets him preach rather than his
[48:16] spirit and his motive
[48:19] it's going to get kind of close here for
[48:21] a minute so just hang with me and we'll
[48:24] we'll get through it now he said I think
[48:26] it's a good thing for us as ministers to
[48:29] follow our order when we see such things
[48:31] in the world as we see today he said we
[48:34] have an order from God is for the
[48:36] Discerning of spirit see my boss gives
[48:39] me an order
[48:40] right and he's the boss right in all
[48:43] things that he might have the
[48:44] preeminence as brother Joel preached
[48:46] Sunday night and so he's the boss and he
[48:49] gets to tell us what the order is and
[48:51] our order is that we should have the
[48:54] Discerning of spirits trying the spirit
[48:56] he said I believe that that is a very
[48:58] great lesson for the church today is to
[49:01] try the spirit of anything have
[49:03] discernment of the spirit he said I do
[49:05] not think that we should ever by any
[49:08] means
[49:09] ever try to judge a person by the
[49:12] denomination they belong to or by the
[49:14] group that they are assembled with
[49:19] whether they be Methodist Baptist
[49:21] Presbyterian Pentecostal or whatever
[49:23] they are
[49:25] we should never judge The Man by the
[49:27] denomination that he belongs to
[49:30] you don't judge preachers in this church
[49:33] by the fact they go to this church
[49:35] or even that I approve of them but let
[49:38] the man's gift speak for itself
[49:42] right and so that's the way we should do
[49:45] what is the man's motive what is his
[49:47] objective
[49:48] and by Discerning that we we don't get
[49:51] LED astray now he said we should never
[49:54] judge The Man by the denomination he
[49:55] belongs to we should always judge him by
[49:58] the spirit he has see the spirit see
[50:01] does he want to help people what's his
[50:03] motive is he building his own Ministry
[50:05] or is he helping the people
[50:07] and I'm glad we've got ministers like
[50:08] yeah that help the people that don't
[50:11] have any other motive but but that's
[50:12] what we want to watch for is that motive
[50:14] he said now he said we are to discern
[50:16] Spirits watch what the man has in mind
[50:19] what he's trying to achieve he said if
[50:21] the man by a gift no matter how great
[50:23] the gift is he said now there's so much
[50:25] in the day that we live in pertaining to
[50:27] gifts so many people judge people by
[50:29] gifts that they have he said well I
[50:31] believe that these things are gifts I
[50:32] believe what we see take place as gifts
[50:34] and their god-given gifts but if we do
[50:37] not use them in the right way that God
[50:39] intended them to be used then we can do
[50:42] more harm with the gifts
[50:44] than we could if we did not have the
[50:47] gifts
[50:49] and he said the other night I made a
[50:51] statement at the pulpit saying this I
[50:52] would rather see Brotherly Love existing
[50:54] among the church
[50:56] if we didn't have one case of healing or
[50:58] anything else he said see we must know
[51:00] what these things are for
[51:03] you now if a man comes and he has a
[51:05] great gift he said no matter if he
[51:07] belongs to our denomination or another
[51:09] denomination don't judge him by what
[51:11] denomination he come from how he dresses
[51:13] but what you want to see is what he's
[51:16] trying to do with that gift
[51:18] what purpose he has
[51:20] and see and that's why you say brother
[51:23] being you're kind of harsh on some
[51:24] things and I know that I am you'd have
[51:27] to have been brought up the way that I
[51:28] was to to understand I I get cynical at
[51:32] times but whenever I see a man sinning
[51:34] promoting his own Ministry over and over
[51:37] and over again and he never talks about
[51:39] the message you don't talk it's his
[51:41] ministry and then if you don't believe
[51:42] it you're going to hell or something bad
[51:44] is going to happen to you so run away
[51:46] from that man
[51:48] your spiritual discernment ought to tell
[51:51] you this is a man that doesn't have the
[51:52] interest of the people at heart
[51:55] he's only interested in his own
[51:57] well-being
[51:59] and the continuation of his own Ministry
[52:02] but God could take us out of the
[52:04] ministry like that
[52:06] then where would we be
[52:08] so we got to be we have to be and I say
[52:10] God I don't say I don't say that I'm
[52:12] always as as I should be in that regard
[52:15] but I say God make make my motives tow
[52:18] the line because it's hard not to get
[52:20] ego mixed in it it's hard not to get
[52:22] these we're human beings
[52:24] we're in the flesh
[52:26] right we we have to we come to church in
[52:28] the flesh and yet we've got to lay that
[52:30] down to be able to minister that's why
[52:32] brother Brown said the gift is to get
[52:33] William Branham out of the way and let
[52:36] God do what God does
[52:39] so your only
[52:40] he said no matter how great a teacher he
[52:42] is
[52:43] he said how powerful he is how
[52:46] intellectual he is or how his gift
[52:48] operates if he isn't trying to achieve
[52:51] something for the benefit of the body of
[52:52] Christ your own spiritual discernment
[52:55] would tell you that that's wrong
[52:57] no matter how accurate how perfect how
[53:00] it is it's wrong if it isn't used for
[53:02] the body of Jesus Christ you're not
[53:04] Discerning the man you're Discerning the
[53:06] spirit the life that's in the man and
[53:08] that's what God told us to do
[53:10] he said not one time was we ever
[53:12] commissioned to discern the man's group
[53:15] but we was constrained and commanded by
[53:17] God to discern the spirit in the man
[53:19] what he's trying to do what the spirit
[53:22] in his life is trying to lead him to
[53:25] yeah so now
[53:28] I want you to judge by the word and by
[53:31] the spirit right so it has to be the
[53:33] right word but that's not enough did you
[53:34] know that
[53:35] I also have to have the right motives in
[53:37] quoting you the word
[53:38] because Jesus Jesus rejected the word of
[53:43] the devil not because he quoted the
[53:45] wrong word he quoted the right word but
[53:48] because of who he was
[53:50] right he rejected because it was the
[53:53] devil quoting it so if the devil quotes
[53:55] you the word and he might sometimes
[53:58] you reject the fact that he quoted it
[54:01] because he's always going to take it out
[54:02] of context he's always going to misplace
[54:04] it misapply it
[54:05] right not because it's not the word he
[54:08] didn't get the word wrong but he got the
[54:09] it was the person so he was rejecting
[54:12] who was telling it so you don't have to
[54:15] just have the right word you need to
[54:16] have the right motives
[54:19] right a great example of that the word
[54:21] says that a word says it's not good for
[54:24] a man to be alone
[54:26] right and I could take that if I was a
[54:29] single man if I was an unmarried man I
[54:31] could take that and say well that means
[54:32] I need to get married
[54:34] and I can quote that to a girl and say
[54:36] okay the word says it's not good for a
[54:38] man to be alone
[54:39] and that's the word
[54:41] but what's his motive
[54:44] does he really love you
[54:46] is he is he interested in the family
[54:48] is he interested in taking care of you
[54:50] is there something there it's got to be
[54:53] more than just word
[54:55] you understand that there's got to be a
[54:58] motive behind it
[54:59] that's right
[55:01] so now
[55:03] that's just spiritual discernment ought
[55:05] to tell us that
[55:06] now
[55:08] there's a Discerning of spirits the gift
[55:10] of discerning of spirits along with the
[55:12] gift of wisdom
[55:13] remember it was to be used it was to be
[55:16] used to judge the other gifts so
[55:19] Discerning of spirits would actually
[55:21] judge whether the prophecy was right
[55:24] whether the tongues interpretation was
[55:27] right
[55:28] that's the purpose of it and and what it
[55:31] would be used for First Corinthians 14
[55:32] 29 is the scripture and we'll get more
[55:35] into that and when we get to tongues and
[55:37] interpretation but he said let the
[55:39] prophet speak two or three and let the
[55:41] other judge but the other judge now
[55:44] brother Brown said we're talking about
[55:45] putting the gifts in the proper place in
[55:47] the room before the service he said
[55:49] before you start this he said get some
[55:50] Spirit of wisdom in there some
[55:52] discernment of spirits you see to find
[55:54] out he said the first thing you know you
[55:56] begin to notice somebody's begin to see
[55:58] that there's a little something wrong he
[56:00] said that's discernment
[56:02] how many of you have ever had just a
[56:03] feeling something was wrong you just
[56:05] didn't understand there was something
[56:06] wrong
[56:07] and you didn't know what it was you
[56:08] couldn't pinpoint it but there's just
[56:10] something wrong
[56:12] well you know sometimes that could be
[56:14] just you
[56:15] but it might be a spirit a discernment
[56:17] in your life and so you take it back to
[56:19] the word
[56:20] and look at the motives and discern the
[56:22] spirit of it
[56:23] are you with me so far
[56:25] you say well yeah remember random says
[56:28] he said there's a lot of difference
[56:28] between a prophet and a gift of Prophecy
[56:31] Before a gift of Prophecy really should
[56:33] be given in the church it has to come
[56:35] before two or three judges that's got
[56:36] the gift of discernment to say whether
[56:39] it can even be said
[56:41] he said well that's okay but my gift is
[56:44] different well you you you can you can
[56:47] live on the edges and in the exceptions
[56:50] but for me I'll take the word of a
[56:52] prophet
[56:54] right and I think that's what we ought
[56:55] to do now again God can do whatever he
[56:58] wants and we we we're we're happy to let
[57:01] God do what God wants to do right
[57:03] but at the same time we want to make
[57:05] sure we stay right with the word
[57:07] so brother rounds to what the church
[57:09] needs tonight is to know how to control
[57:10] these gifts he said for evil spirits you
[57:13] can come in and speak just the same as
[57:14] good spirits can speak he said you know
[57:16] that you must have the spirit of
[57:19] discernment to know that he said they
[57:21] had it in Bible times that's why Paul
[57:22] said let one judge and the people judge
[57:24] and so forth those gifts of Prophecy
[57:26] everything is supposed to be correctly
[57:28] put in order
[57:29] he said for Satan can imitate every gift
[57:31] that God's got every gift he can imitate
[57:33] it and you must know the right and wrong
[57:35] and by its fruits you know it that's why
[57:38] Paul said judge nothing before the time
[57:40] don't judge it on a mode don't judge a
[57:42] whole life on a moment
[57:45] right they may a bad decision a good
[57:47] decision but don't judge a whole life on
[57:49] five seconds
[57:51] judge it on its fruits
[57:54] now watch
[57:55] and he said watch whether it comes to
[57:58] pass and whether it's truth or not and
[58:00] that's the way you know the spirit now
[58:03] we know that the gifts have been
[58:04] restored aren't you glad for that
[58:07] but the restoration of gifts is not our
[58:10] message
[58:15] going to preach to you again I have a
[58:17] boss I have to listen to the boss
[58:20] the ma our message is the full word
[58:24] that's that's strong meat but I think we
[58:26] can take it tonight
[58:28] our message is the full word
[58:30] but the brown said we come into the
[58:32] Pentecostal age he talked about Luther
[58:33] and Wesley he said the restoration of
[58:35] the gifts is a very fine thing it was
[58:37] fine in the age but we are going beyond
[58:39] that now he said we are beyond that just
[58:41] as sure as there is a world he said
[58:43] we've got to come Beyond this thing
[58:45] because we have done the same thing with
[58:47] it that they did before he's talking
[58:49] about the brass serpent remember what
[58:51] happened to the Brass serpent they it
[58:53] was something God used for healing
[58:55] and yet it become an idol and later on
[58:58] it had to be destroyed
[59:00] because the people began to worship it
[59:02] right
[59:02] right and he said they they've done that
[59:04] we have done the same thing with it that
[59:06] they did before making an idol out of it
[59:08] I belonged to this order of it I belong
[59:11] to that order of it he said God will
[59:13] send somebody that will smash the thing
[59:14] and tear it to pieces and confirm his
[59:16] word before word you say when is that
[59:18] person coming
[59:20] it was a prophet that came
[59:23] that was what the prophet was for
[59:25] he came and smashed that Pentecostal
[59:27] idea to pieces and let's not try to put
[59:30] it back together
[59:31] let it be let it lay
[59:35] not our message
[59:38] but yet we believe in the restoration of
[59:39] the gifts it's part of it
[59:41] but it's not we but we believe in the
[59:43] fullness of the word how many are glad
[59:45] for the fullness of the word tonight the
[59:47] fullness of the word will will correct
[59:49] us will keep us in the right way it is
[59:51] the Fallen it's Christ himself you
[59:53] realize the maturity of the age that you
[59:55] live in you don't live in a stalking you
[59:58] don't live in a in a tossful age you
[1:00:00] know you live in the age of the of the
[1:00:02] Original Seed the original grain that
[1:00:04] means it's all yours Joy is yours power
[1:00:08] is yours gifts are your all that's yours
[1:00:10] but you don't major on any one thing
[1:00:12] we're not looking for the restoration of
[1:00:14] one thing the bride Revival is not the
[1:00:17] restoration of gifts
[1:00:19] that has already been restored but the
[1:00:22] bride Revival is all of it
[1:00:25] amen it's restoring all of it
[1:00:31] foreign
[1:00:35] just hang with me I've
[1:00:37] I've studied this for weeks and weeks
[1:00:39] and weeks
[1:00:41] now a prophet had discernment how many
[1:00:43] know what he called discernment I mean
[1:00:45] know that
[1:00:46] our Prophet William Branham had
[1:00:48] discernment
[1:00:50] what he had happens one time
[1:00:53] to the Gentile age we went through that
[1:00:55] before but what he had was what Elisha
[1:00:58] had
[1:00:59] right now we've talked about gift of
[1:01:01] discernment we've talked about the
[1:01:04] Christians that has discernment between
[1:01:06] right and wrong
[1:01:07] but what did a prophet have
[1:01:11] now it wasn't merely a gift of
[1:01:14] discernment
[1:01:15] and this is what Elisha had when the
[1:01:18] heart of the king of Syria was troubled
[1:01:20] because somebody always knew what he was
[1:01:22] doing
[1:01:23] and every time he got the king of Israel
[1:01:25] in a trap he got out of it
[1:01:28] and he asked he said which one of us is
[1:01:30] for the king of Israel and one of his
[1:01:31] servants said none my Lord but Elisha
[1:01:33] the prophet telling the king of Israel
[1:01:35] the words that thou speakest in my bed
[1:01:38] chamber and how would Elisha know he saw
[1:01:40] it in a vision
[1:01:42] right
[1:01:44] it was a prophet
[1:01:46] this gift was known by the kings of the
[1:01:48] Earth
[1:01:49] as being true now brother Branham always
[1:01:53] goes back to Abraham on this Genesis 18
[1:01:55] 13 we're going to serve some strong meat
[1:01:58] tonight and and uh and then we'll go
[1:02:00] back to the milk for those that can't
[1:02:02] take it but I know that you can take it
[1:02:04] tonight that's why you're here on a
[1:02:06] Wednesday night
[1:02:08] but now brother Brown goes back to
[1:02:09] Abraham Genesis 18 13 the Lord said to
[1:02:12] Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh he was
[1:02:14] sitting with his back to the tent and
[1:02:17] Sarah didn't laugh audibly she laughed
[1:02:18] in her heart
[1:02:20] what was it he he knew what was in her
[1:02:24] heart
[1:02:26] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:02:27] what could do that remember what
[1:02:29] scripture we read in Hebrews he said the
[1:02:32] word
[1:02:33] is a discerner
[1:02:35] and it was not the other angels
[1:02:39] who had that gift of discernment it was
[1:02:41] not those who went down into Sodom
[1:02:44] but the Lord
[1:02:45] Capital Lord
[1:02:48] the king to Abraham and stayed with
[1:02:49] Abraham was the one who had the gift of
[1:02:52] discernment it was God in a body brother
[1:02:55] random talks about he he just blew it
[1:02:57] off of his hand created himself a body
[1:03:00] right it was God in flesh
[1:03:03] and he had a gift of discernment
[1:03:06] that's what we would call that's what we
[1:03:08] know it as but it was the word
[1:03:10] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:03:12] the heart now God does that he does that
[1:03:14] he does that even while the word is
[1:03:17] being preached you know he does that
[1:03:19] still today God does that but not in
[1:03:22] this manner
[1:03:23] what this was the reason it was public
[1:03:26] the reason it was on the platform the
[1:03:28] reason why he would he would discern the
[1:03:30] thoughts and intents of the people
[1:03:31] sitting in front of him was because it
[1:03:32] would identify the word
[1:03:35] that's what it was church we we need to
[1:03:37] grow up
[1:03:38] and recognize what God's done in our day
[1:03:41] I believe you have I believe that
[1:03:44] and so now Simon in John 1 42
[1:03:49] and we find that brother random always
[1:03:51] uses this here Jesus the word
[1:03:54] is is Discerning the thoughts intents of
[1:03:58] the heart
[1:03:59] and he said Thou Art Simon the son of
[1:04:01] Jonah
[1:04:02] and then you'll be called cephas or
[1:04:04] Peter my interpretation of stone
[1:04:07] and then Nathanael comes and yeah you've
[1:04:09] heard brother Brown talk about this many
[1:04:11] many times but Nathanael comes and and
[1:04:14] Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and
[1:04:16] said for him behold an Israelite indeed
[1:04:18] and with whom is no guile
[1:04:21] and Nathaniel said unto him when SnoWest
[1:04:23] thou me
[1:04:24] Jesus answered and said it to him before
[1:04:26] that Philip called thee when thouest
[1:04:28] under the Fig Tree I saw thee
[1:04:31] and watch what Nathanael says Nathanael
[1:04:33] answered and said unto him Rabbi Thou
[1:04:35] Art the son of God
[1:04:38] he identified him as the word
[1:04:42] and how many know what the son of man is
[1:04:45] the son of man is the word the son of
[1:04:47] man is not William Branham
[1:04:49] the son of man is not it's not some new
[1:04:52] messenger the son of man is the word
[1:04:55] that's what a prophet taught us and the
[1:04:57] son of man revealed himself to the
[1:04:58] ministry of William Brown
[1:05:01] so now is now Nathanael comes to him and
[1:05:05] he sees him in Nathaniel says this is
[1:05:06] you're the Son of God because he saw it
[1:05:09] in a vision and he told him the word
[1:05:11] discern the thoughts and the intents of
[1:05:13] the heart now what what do you think
[1:05:15] would have happened if all of the
[1:05:16] disciples had the gift of discernment
[1:05:20] and all of them out here operating they
[1:05:22] could they could cast out devils
[1:05:24] they could do whatever else that they
[1:05:26] wanted to do they could have great
[1:05:27] revivals but they did not have this gift
[1:05:30] and there's a reason for that because it
[1:05:32] identified the word
[1:05:38] no
[1:05:39] Nathaniel
[1:05:41] said you're the Son of God brother
[1:05:42] random says this and I read this last
[1:05:44] time it's very important
[1:05:46] he said don't say your pastor or anybody
[1:05:47] would be taking the gift of discernment
[1:05:49] your pastor has a right to lay hands on
[1:05:51] you but I'm not going to stand up here
[1:05:53] and start taking the gift of discernment
[1:05:56] and there's a reason for that
[1:05:58] that's not their calling that's not
[1:06:00] their calling to do that that's to be
[1:06:03] one in in the age
[1:06:04] this was not just a gift
[1:06:07] and that's what I want to drive in home
[1:06:09] to you today it's not to reflect on
[1:06:11] anything else because I'm only
[1:06:13] responsible for here
[1:06:15] and I want that to be the case because
[1:06:18] my brain's not big enough to take care
[1:06:21] of everybody my gift is not big enough I
[1:06:23] I want this to come to you today and and
[1:06:25] for those of you that are here and those
[1:06:27] of you that are from our church that are
[1:06:28] watching I'd say this if you're if you
[1:06:31] want to know the word for yourself what
[1:06:34] were the random thought about this it's
[1:06:35] there and I'm trying to give you just a
[1:06:38] glimpse of that today but there's many
[1:06:39] many many other quotes the brother
[1:06:41] Branham deals with this it's not just a
[1:06:43] gift I want you to understand what
[1:06:44] brother Brandon's Ministry was I think
[1:06:46] we lose sight of that sometimes
[1:06:49] and and there's a reason why and you
[1:06:52] lose sight of that because some people
[1:06:53] made it just a cult yeah
[1:06:55] right when you sit down and you got a
[1:06:57] picture and you gotta you got a piece of
[1:06:59] his floor and it's just nothing but a
[1:07:01] cult it's an idol crafted from the
[1:07:03] message as brother biscoll so eloquently
[1:07:06] put it so many years ago just just made
[1:07:08] themselves a god
[1:07:10] right and some people did that and yet
[1:07:13] sometimes when we react to that and and
[1:07:15] we back away from it so much and we
[1:07:17] don't realize God did do something in
[1:07:19] our day yeah God did something in our
[1:07:21] age
[1:07:22] there's a reason why we speak about the
[1:07:24] brown like we do
[1:07:27] because God revealed himself in that
[1:07:29] Ministry the word was the discerner the
[1:07:32] thoughts and intents of the heart and
[1:07:35] and so there's uh there's got to be
[1:07:38] something there's got to be something
[1:07:40] that uh and I heard brother biscoll
[1:07:43] actually Minister on this about 13 years
[1:07:45] ago I remember him ministering on I just
[1:07:48] went back in and found or someone sent
[1:07:50] me the uh the the video on it because
[1:07:53] I'd requested it here recently he was
[1:07:55] preaching about this and he did a really
[1:07:57] good job I think he called it the age of
[1:07:58] acceptance but he made the point that
[1:08:01] but the Brandon was always trying to
[1:08:02] move the people from The Gift of
[1:08:04] discernment over to the word
[1:08:07] because he would say the word is the
[1:08:09] discerner of the thought put that in the
[1:08:10] message information pull it up sometime
[1:08:12] you'll find it over and over and over
[1:08:14] again the word is a discerner of the
[1:08:16] thoughts and Tents of the heart and we
[1:08:18] again we know the son of man is the word
[1:08:20] and brother Brandon talking about
[1:08:22] Abraham he said watch what this one did
[1:08:24] to the church elected Jesus called your
[1:08:27] attention to the same thing what
[1:08:28] happened in the last days when the son
[1:08:30] of man would reveal himself in human
[1:08:32] flesh the word knowing the secret of the
[1:08:34] heart you believe he still knows it
[1:08:36] today he still does
[1:08:38] but he revealed himself in a special way
[1:08:40] in this ministry to tell us that he's
[1:08:42] still a discerner of the thought
[1:08:44] sentence of the heart he said as it said
[1:08:46] it's more powerful than a two-edged
[1:08:47] sword and a discerner of the thoughts
[1:08:49] intense of the heart like all the
[1:08:51] prophets did
[1:08:52] like that's how they identified
[1:08:54] themselves as Prophets
[1:08:57] right like Jesus did himself you realize
[1:09:01] that we're under our messenger for the
[1:09:04] age
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:07] I will say this when it comes to our
[1:09:09] Salvation we're level brother Branham is
[1:09:11] no different than us
[1:09:13] no different
[1:09:14] he doesn't occupy a special place in
[1:09:16] Salvation
[1:09:17] but he does occupy a special office and
[1:09:21] in office there is an order to the
[1:09:23] office God's not a communist
[1:09:25] right you have a local Pastor for a
[1:09:28] reason
[1:09:29] you can't not everybody can be your
[1:09:31] pastor
[1:09:32] right it's just the way that it is and
[1:09:34] yet yet I want you to benefit from every
[1:09:36] ministry that's out there but not
[1:09:37] everybody can be your pastor
[1:09:39] right not everybody's called with that
[1:09:40] burden to be able to do that and and the
[1:09:44] same with with the messenger not
[1:09:45] everybody can be the messenger there's
[1:09:47] one Messenger to the age and that's the
[1:09:50] day that we live in is is that messenger
[1:09:52] and I'm don't ignore me tonight because
[1:09:54] you think I'm just lifting up a man I'm
[1:09:56] not lifting up a man I'm lifting up what
[1:09:58] the word did in our day
[1:10:00] yes sir this is the word that we believe
[1:10:05] everything we do is a result of this
[1:10:07] message
[1:10:09] there's no getting around that
[1:10:12] so now
[1:10:13] brother Brown says he said it's the word
[1:10:16] knowing the secret of the heart
[1:10:18] he said it's more powerful than a
[1:10:20] two-edged sword and a discerner of the
[1:10:22] thoughts and sins of the heart like all
[1:10:23] the prophets like Jesus himself was
[1:10:24] called to be else above and rejected
[1:10:27] here again in the last days he said but
[1:10:28] the word and those prophets always was
[1:10:30] able to foretell and to discern
[1:10:33] and again you can go you can find dozens
[1:10:36] and I think there's more than a hundred
[1:10:37] actually like 170 quotes that say
[1:10:41] basically the same thing
[1:10:43] he said the word of those prophets
[1:10:44] always was able to foretell into discern
[1:10:46] he said that's the word for that day
[1:10:48] that's what identified them as Prophets
[1:10:52] that's what identified them as Prophets
[1:10:55] and remember he promised that the world
[1:10:57] would be in that condition would receive
[1:10:58] that sign again before his coming
[1:11:01] and so the best of my knowledge I mean
[1:11:04] think about the gift of discernment and
[1:11:05] again
[1:11:07] I'm doing the best I can right because
[1:11:10] the word's so much bigger
[1:11:12] than us and I'll always humble myself to
[1:11:15] that and there's so many men that know
[1:11:16] so much more than what I would know and
[1:11:18] I'm not I'm not trying to to just be
[1:11:20] humble there it's just the truth
[1:11:22] and so I I'd defer to everybody in every
[1:11:25] way except for when it comes to the
[1:11:27] plain truth of the word
[1:11:30] right because if it's just there I can't
[1:11:32] deny what the word says
[1:11:34] right and and I cannot find anywhere
[1:11:36] where there's a gift that stands reveals
[1:11:39] the secrets of the hearts except for a
[1:11:40] word prophet
[1:11:42] yeah there's just not any other that's
[1:11:44] not one of the nine spiritual gifts a
[1:11:46] nice spiritual gift of discernment which
[1:11:48] is what the Pentecostals thought brother
[1:11:49] Branham had was the Discerning of
[1:11:51] spirits to tell between good and evil
[1:11:53] and to be able to judge between the
[1:11:55] gifts
[1:11:56] so that so this was a different kind of
[1:11:58] discernment this was the sign of the
[1:12:00] Resurrection
[1:12:02] God was telling us I'm still alive
[1:12:07] hey man this he did something he had
[1:12:10] done now he does many things today that
[1:12:11] he did when he was on the Earth but this
[1:12:13] was something specific to a prophet yeah
[1:12:16] this was something specific to a prophet
[1:12:19] he still heals the sick he still raises
[1:12:22] the dead he's still we still have the
[1:12:24] spiritual gifts we still have all of
[1:12:26] these things he still does all of those
[1:12:28] things
[1:12:29] but this was specific to a prophet
[1:12:31] because it showed us Christ is is Among
[1:12:35] Us Again
[1:12:36] this was the him and his word coming
[1:12:38] coming in in a form of Son of Man
[1:12:41] and there's nothing more plain I can see
[1:12:43] than that now this was the sign of the
[1:12:46] Resurrection
[1:12:47] now if that gift could be as I said in
[1:12:50] anyone it could have been in any of the
[1:12:51] other disciples then how would the woman
[1:12:53] at the well know
[1:12:55] sir I perceive you're a prophet remember
[1:12:58] that he dealt with her in three
[1:13:00] different ways he dealt with her he said
[1:13:02] he dealt with her in the flesh realm get
[1:13:04] woman get me a drink
[1:13:06] right he dealt with her in the spirit
[1:13:07] Realm when he when he discerned the the
[1:13:11] thoughts the intents of her heart and
[1:13:13] then he dealt with her in the word realm
[1:13:14] we've gotten into that before when he
[1:13:16] when he began to tell her the he began
[1:13:18] to tell her the word and she said well
[1:13:20] we're we worship in this mountain and he
[1:13:22] said but you worship Him in spirit and
[1:13:23] in truth
[1:13:26] right and that was we've typed that the
[1:13:28] first second and third poll and but his
[1:13:30] body's Soul and Spirit and we we want to
[1:13:33] be dealt with in a word Realm
[1:13:35] but he dealt with us first in the second
[1:13:38] poll in the realm of the spirit and he
[1:13:41] discerned the spirit and he discerned
[1:13:44] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:13:45] because the word knows the thoughts and
[1:13:48] intents of the heart and it identified
[1:13:50] that the word was present in our day
[1:13:53] that's a big deal church that's a big
[1:13:55] deal that's happened in our time that
[1:13:58] the word the same one and spoke to
[1:14:00] Abraham I'm not talking about William
[1:14:01] Branham the man I'm talking about the
[1:14:03] word
[1:14:05] the word that was with Abraham the word
[1:14:08] that was in Jesus Christ the word came
[1:14:10] in our day
[1:14:14] so now
[1:14:16] that's how the woman at the well knew
[1:14:17] now
[1:14:18] I'm so glad he came to me
[1:14:21] huh
[1:14:22] so glad the word is still a discerner
[1:14:24] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:14:26] and this message when I heard it that
[1:14:28] came to me that still means something
[1:14:31] means something to hear the message of
[1:14:33] the hour that's not hearing it alone is
[1:14:36] not salvation but there was a seed
[1:14:37] inside of you that was quickened to it
[1:14:39] something inside of you couldn't stay
[1:14:41] away from it
[1:14:43] something inside of you and interrupted
[1:14:45] in a new birth and you were born again
[1:14:46] you were Justified you your life you
[1:14:49] begin to sanctify your life that all of
[1:14:51] a sudden you were filled with the
[1:14:52] baptism the Holy Ghost but what was it
[1:14:54] the word working all the time because
[1:14:56] the word is all of that I've preached
[1:14:57] that to you before you can't separate
[1:14:59] the word in the spirit the atmosphere
[1:15:01] always comes with the word
[1:15:04] and so if we want the atmosphere we need
[1:15:06] to stay with the word
[1:15:08] so this is the sign that the wicked and
[1:15:11] adulterous generation sought after
[1:15:14] yeah but he said there wouldn't be a
[1:15:15] sign given to it but the sign of the
[1:15:16] Prophet Jonas the resurrection sign
[1:15:20] this was the sign of the revealing of
[1:15:22] the son of man Luke 17 30. even thus
[1:15:24] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:15:25] man is revealed this was the last sign
[1:15:30] we live in a late hour
[1:15:33] but the random said remember that sign
[1:15:34] of discernment is the last message to
[1:15:36] the Gentile Church
[1:15:39] he said again he said the next thing is
[1:15:40] to the Seed of Abraham they're getting
[1:15:42] their last sign of discernment just like
[1:15:43] it was in Jesus day that's the last sign
[1:15:45] to the church he said remember write it
[1:15:48] down
[1:15:49] I may be gone
[1:15:51] see if it's right or not
[1:15:53] the last biblical sign
[1:15:58] again he said God changed her body and
[1:16:00] turned them back it's a mystery that's
[1:16:01] to be revealed now in this day by the
[1:16:03] son of man see the evening message
[1:16:04] what's he talking about this was a
[1:16:07] mystery we didn't know but here he's
[1:16:09] talking but the Jeremy about Abraham and
[1:16:11] Sarah and how Sarah was was changed to a
[1:16:14] young woman because she goes down and
[1:16:16] and the King takes her as a wife
[1:16:18] it's she's an old grandma brother Brown
[1:16:20] said read between the lines it's a
[1:16:23] mystery reveal in our day she had a body
[1:16:24] change
[1:16:25] she was turned back he said and that was
[1:16:28] the last sign they seen before she was
[1:16:30] turned back
[1:16:32] what's that discernment
[1:16:34] he said before the change of the body
[1:16:35] come
[1:16:37] he said and remember Abraham and his
[1:16:38] group never received one more sign from
[1:16:40] God until the promised son arrived he
[1:16:42] said how many knows that's true that
[1:16:43] sign of discernment he said the Royal
[1:16:45] Seed of Abraham let them hear you let me
[1:16:47] tell you thus saith the Lord you're
[1:16:48] receiving your last sign he said that's
[1:16:51] according to the scriptures and the
[1:16:52] revelation of God that's in my heart
[1:16:53] that speaks that this is the truth he
[1:16:56] said I trust that you will believe it to
[1:16:57] be the truth I want to say tonight I
[1:16:59] believe it
[1:17:02] but there's always been impersonations
[1:17:03] of that and again that's just always
[1:17:06] been the case and I'm thankful in one
[1:17:08] way that come up the way I did I went to
[1:17:10] David Terrell's meetings he's gone now
[1:17:12] but he was a person who believed brother
[1:17:14] Brandon was a prophet but he was another
[1:17:15] prophet and he was in the in the
[1:17:18] Pentecostal Apostolic realm been in his
[1:17:20] meetings I've been in different people
[1:17:22] like that used to there's not as many
[1:17:24] today but uh there were used to there
[1:17:27] was a bunch of people
[1:17:29] claiming to have signed the sign of
[1:17:31] discernment it was out there it was a
[1:17:33] whole bunch and I've noticed that it's
[1:17:36] not there anymore like people are
[1:17:37] getting away from that because it was so
[1:17:39] uh it was pretty comical actually in
[1:17:42] some cases because when they tried it
[1:17:44] was so so vague I remember Richard
[1:17:46] Roberts getting on the television and
[1:17:48] telling people someone in my television
[1:17:50] audience has a backache
[1:17:53] someone has a headache and I don't mean
[1:17:55] to make fun of that tonight but that's
[1:17:57] not what our Prophet did that's not a
[1:17:58] gift of discernment
[1:18:00] and maybe a gift of Prophecy
[1:18:02] could be could be but those things have
[1:18:04] to be judged
[1:18:06] right but it couldn't be a gift of
[1:18:08] discernment like our Prophet had
[1:18:10] because there's one to an age and it
[1:18:13] just didn't you watch the results of it
[1:18:14] now let's look at what a prophet did I
[1:18:16] want to make this positive that's where
[1:18:18] because we want to know what a prophet
[1:18:20] did look
[1:18:21] brother Brandon said he's talking
[1:18:23] specifically you know and I took this
[1:18:26] idea of well someone has a headache
[1:18:28] let's see how the prophet dealt with
[1:18:30] that
[1:18:31] he said the first place he's in
[1:18:32] discernment he says the woman is leaving
[1:18:34] me she's leaving me he's having a vision
[1:18:37] yeah
[1:18:39] he said I see her at a table she's
[1:18:41] refusing to eat because she has a
[1:18:43] stomach trouble she's at a place where
[1:18:45] there's somebody looking through into
[1:18:47] her bowels it's a doctor
[1:18:50] he said and he says she's got something
[1:18:53] wrong in the colon
[1:18:55] he calls it a stoppage or a block or
[1:18:58] something in the colon the doctor did I
[1:19:00] see it on the paper
[1:19:04] that he was riding on
[1:19:06] he said that's right that's the saith
[1:19:08] the Lord
[1:19:10] he said there's two of them consulted
[1:19:12] that he goes on look at the detail of it
[1:19:15] right
[1:19:16] there are two of them consulted that two
[1:19:18] doctors that's where I see two of them
[1:19:21] he said Do you believe me to be his
[1:19:22] prophet
[1:19:23] he said now here's another thing I see
[1:19:24] someone standing by you it's a child
[1:19:26] little fellow about 10 years old he's
[1:19:29] here with you today and suffers with a
[1:19:31] migraine headache
[1:19:34] there's your headache
[1:19:36] so that's right amen now take that
[1:19:38] handkerchief in your hand lay it on him
[1:19:39] it'll leave him
[1:19:42] he said this lady right back here
[1:19:44] suffering with headache
[1:19:45] he said God don't let her miss it oh God
[1:19:48] please miss Morton
[1:19:49] he didn't just say somebody in the
[1:19:51] building has a headache watch to see who
[1:19:53] held their head
[1:19:55] so Miss Martin believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:19:57] Christ he healed you from that headache
[1:19:59] see he wouldn't let her pass by
[1:20:02] oh I love that he won't let you pass by
[1:20:04] if there's something for you he'll make
[1:20:06] sure you get it
[1:20:08] he said I want to ask you something last
[1:20:10] night when I spoke to somebody in the
[1:20:12] building about their headache he said
[1:20:14] you had a real funny feeling and you was
[1:20:16] wondering whether that was you or not
[1:20:18] you know exact the gift is it wasn't her
[1:20:21] but she was wondering if it was her
[1:20:23] and the and the word the discerner the
[1:20:26] thoughts the intents of the heart knew
[1:20:27] that
[1:20:29] amen

[1:21:51] you that brother Brown memorized the
[1:21:52] prayer cards it's nonsense
[1:21:55] and it's very easily disproved
[1:21:58] because of the detail
[1:22:00] and prayer cards were the size of a
[1:22:01] business card
[1:22:03] right
[1:22:05] now look

[1:33:29] whatever you need to I receive it
[1:33:32] yeah
[1:33:33] amen
[1:33:35] that was a real prophet
[1:33:38] so I wanted to point out to you about
[1:33:39] that video there was uh uh two colored
[1:33:42] Colored Women two black women that stood
[1:33:45] up there and uh brother Branham uh
[1:33:48] Point's mother was a white lady that
[1:33:49] stood up with them I always wondered
[1:33:50] about that and that lady that stood up
[1:33:53] with him but you watched how brother
[1:33:54] Branham corrects that he was talking
[1:33:56] evidently she had a similar ailment and
[1:33:58] she was sitting near but brother Brown
[1:33:59] said the lady behind her and it was the
[1:34:02] the black lady that was sitting behind
[1:34:04] her and they responded to the word by
[1:34:07] shouting about someone else's healing
[1:34:09] and the angel of the Lord moved back
[1:34:11] where they were
[1:34:13] and healed them
[1:34:17] listen church we don't have to have a
[1:34:20] special service
[1:34:23] to have the word present that is a
[1:34:25] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:34:27] the heart that atmosphere is here
[1:34:31] just you can just watch that and the
[1:34:34] atmosphere changes the presence of the
[1:34:37] Lord is here right now because it builds
[1:34:39] faith it shows you God was doing
[1:34:42] something in our day
[1:34:43] he doesn't have to do that again to get
[1:34:45] my attention
[1:34:47] but the random said that the people
[1:34:49] overseas understood the gift he said the
[1:34:51] people in America never did he said
[1:34:52] because they want to see it over and
[1:34:54] over again he said they'd stop rejoicing
[1:34:56] he rebuked them for stopping to
[1:34:58] rejoicing when people were just having
[1:34:59] hands laid on them they wanted they
[1:35:01] waited for a discernment and he said
[1:35:03] that they don't understand it all you
[1:35:04] have to see it is one time
[1:35:06] no God is present
[1:35:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:35:11] forever do we believe that he didn't die
[1:35:13] in 1965.
[1:35:15] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:35:18] forever
