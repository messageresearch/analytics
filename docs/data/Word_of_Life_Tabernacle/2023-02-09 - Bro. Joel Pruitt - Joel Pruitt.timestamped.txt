[10:02] faith that we need tonight that we're

[10:05] regardless of what comes our way
[10:06] regardless of what life would throw at
[10:09] us we're going to make it I think we

[10:13] good just to confess that don't you
[10:14] think so and if we could let's just bow
[10:16] our heads just for a few moments just

[10:24] just ask you would just come and speak
[10:25] to these people
[10:26] Lord I pray you just help us to lay
[10:28] aside everything Lord that would that
[10:31] would be a hindrance to us to hear your
[10:33] word Lord anything that would come
[10:35] between us Lord and you that that we
[10:38] need to cast down lord I pray you would
[10:39] just come Lord in a special way tonight

[10:44] can receive something from you tonight
[10:46] oh God I pray you just anoint the

[10:51] to say something Lord that would be of
[10:53] value to these people Lord Lord and I

[10:57] Lord it was good to be in the house of
[10:59] the Lord and that we received a blessing
[11:01] from you we want to thank you we ask you
[11:03] all these things in Jesus name
[11:05] amen are you happy to be in the house of
[11:07] the Lord tonight
[11:09] tell you what if you're here on a night
[11:11] like this I'd say you wanted to be here
[11:13] so if you could let's turn to First
[11:16] Peter chapter 5 and verse 8. and I'll
[11:19] try not to hold you long I'll set my
[11:21] timer this time my brother text me and
[11:23] reminded me to do that
[11:25] so
[11:26] so I guess pastor's orders are not to
[11:29] hold you too long
[11:32] First Peter chapter 5 and verse 8 it
[11:34] says be sober be vigilant because your
[11:37] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[11:39] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[11:42] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[11:44] knowing that the same afflictions are
[11:46] accomplished in your brethren that are
[11:48] in the world
[11:49] but the God of all Grace who hath called
[11:51] us unto his eternal glory by Christ
[11:53] Jesus after that ye have suffered a
[11:56] while make you perfect establish
[11:58] strengthen and settle you and if we
[12:00] could go over to Ephesians chapter 6 and
[12:03] verse 10
[12:04] Ephesians 6 and verse 10 it says finally
[12:08] my brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[12:11] the power of His might put on the whole
[12:13] armor of God that ye may be able to
[12:15] stand against The Wiles of the devil and
[12:18] if we could skip down to verse 13
[12:20] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[12:22] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[12:24] in the evil day and having done all to
[12:26] stand stand therefore having your loin
[12:30] skirt about with truth and having on the
[12:31] breastplate of righteousness and your
[12:33] feet shod with the preparation of the
[12:35] gospel of peace above all taking the
[12:38] shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be
[12:40] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[12:44] the wicked you may be seated may the
[12:45] Lord add His blessings to the word
[12:48] and just tonight I was studying along
[12:51] the thought of
[12:54] the greatest battle ever fought and I
[12:56] know many of you you've all heard that
[12:57] message that brother Brandon preached
[12:59] the greatest battle ever fought and
[13:00] brother Branham tells us very clearly
[13:02] that the greatest battle ever fought is
[13:03] in the mind can you say Amen to that and
[13:06] so the greatest battle today I believe
[13:08] that we're still fighting is spiritual
[13:10] warfare and it is a constant battle in
[13:12] the mind because without the holy spirit
[13:15] in you there's nothing to counter the
[13:16] evil thoughts that would come there's
[13:18] nothing to keep the evil thoughts from
[13:19] staying there or roosting there and to
[13:21] to take root but the Holy Spirit
[13:23] produces a supernatural element in your
[13:26] mind but there is also an unconverted
[13:28] part of the mind and the prophet teaches
[13:30] us that there is always going to be a
[13:32] battle there there will always be a
[13:34] battle in your mind that that that's
[13:36] that you're just not going to get away
[13:37] from on this side there's always going
[13:39] to be two two Spirits talking to you and
[13:42] one is always going to be telling you uh
[13:44] how how good you are and and how how you
[13:47] are bride and the other one's going to
[13:48] be telling you you're not good enough to
[13:49] make it the other one's going to tell
[13:51] you you're going to fail and the other
[13:52] one's going to be and remember one of
[13:53] them is the devil talking to you and so
[13:56] if you know the word of God you can
[13:58] counter the devil and you can understand
[14:00] his tactics and everything he has to
[14:02] bring at you and brother Branham talks
[14:04] about it like this because there has to
[14:06] be two elements there at work and
[14:08] brother Bram talks about that a devil is
[14:10] almost harmless unless he can have
[14:12] something to work in he said you
[14:15] remember those Devils that were cast out
[14:16] of Legion they had they they wanted to
[14:19] do more mischieviousness so they wanted
[14:21] to go into the Hogs the Devils must have
[14:23] something to work in somebody to work
[14:25] through and that's the way God does too
[14:28] aren't you thankful for that he has to
[14:30] have us he's depending on us to work
[14:33] through so we can be working for God or
[14:36] we can be working for Satan it's
[14:38] whatever voice we yield to in our mind
[14:40] and so and I believe God has got to have
[14:43] somebody who will lay aside the evil
[14:45] thoughts in this day and just believe
[14:47] God and take his word and I believe that
[14:49] will be the Overcomer and we don't take
[14:51] anything the devil tries to force on us
[14:53] without fighting that battle brother
[14:55] Brandon goes on to say overcome means to
[14:57] recognize the devil in every one of his
[15:00] tricks I think we need to do that
[15:01] tonight
[15:02] he said a lot of people says there is no
[15:04] devil it's just a thought he said don't
[15:06] you believe that there is a real devil
[15:08] he's just as real as you are or anybody
[15:11] a real devil and you must recognize him
[15:13] real we know he's real but we're
[15:16] thankful that God is greater we know
[15:18] that God is also real but those two
[15:20] spirits will always work in you and in
[15:23] your mind now in the heart and the soul
[15:25] that the devil has no bearing on that
[15:27] unless you allow him to stay in your
[15:29] mind and sit there and stay there long
[15:31] enough he will cause doubt even down
[15:33] into your soul and so brother Brandon
[15:35] would go on and he said he said you must
[15:37] recognize him real you must know he's a
[15:39] devil then the same time you recognize
[15:42] him you know he's the devil and he's
[15:44] against you then to overcome you must
[15:47] recognize that God is it is in you is
[15:50] greater and mightier than he is he said
[15:52] that's the one that's in you has already
[15:54] overcome him and by his grace you are
[15:57] more than a match for him oh I'm
[15:59] thankful for that tonight we are more
[16:01] than a match for the Dead level the
[16:03] devil's going to come he's going to
[16:05] fight you he's going to sit there and
[16:06] tell you all kinds of nonsense he's
[16:08] going to sit right on your shoulder in
[16:10] church service he's going to go in your
[16:11] car and ride down the road with you but
[16:13] you have a force within you that is
[16:15] greater than all the devils in the world
[16:17] aren't you thankful for that tonight he
[16:19] said there's real overcoming when you
[16:22] recognize he said he said there's no
[16:24] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[16:25] Jesus said walk not after the flesh but
[16:28] after the spirit he said then you
[16:29] realize that you've overcome he said you
[16:32] know he said he said you can say you
[16:34] can't say I got a sickness and and I
[16:35] don't believe it is a sickness he said
[16:37] oh yes it is you've got a cancer you
[16:39] don't believe it's cancer it is a cancer
[16:40] he said but remember greater is he
[16:43] that's in you that's in the world
[16:45] greater is you the greater is he that's
[16:47] in you than the cancer that's in you
[16:49] greater is the spirit of God in you than
[16:51] the spirit of the devil is trying to
[16:53] speak in your mind tonight he said and
[16:55] he's in you and you can overcome by him
[16:58] that's exactly sensible he said it's
[17:00] exactly the way the scripture is written
[17:02] I'd like to tell you tonight the devil
[17:04] knows he's a bluff but he don't know if
[17:06] you know it yet
[17:07] the devil knows it he knows he has no
[17:09] power over you he has no keys he has
[17:12] nothing to use on you anymore but you
[17:14] have been set free by the atonement of
[17:17] Jesus Christ and I think all we have to
[17:19] realize today is the devil knows he's a
[17:21] bluff now if we could realize the same
[17:23] thing that he would have no power over
[17:25] us anymore
[17:26] he said and brother Branham goes on and
[17:28] let's let's do this first Romans 12 and
[17:30] 2. I don't think I put it to you brother
[17:32] Robert but Romans 12 and 2 says and be
[17:34] not conformed to this world but be ye
[17:36] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[17:38] that you may be able to prove what is
[17:41] that good and acceptable and perfect
[17:43] will of God so you'll see there you must
[17:46] be transformed by the renewing of your
[17:48] mind it's not something it's not good
[17:50] enough to say well I'll just sit here in
[17:52] this battle and Satan can sit here and
[17:54] tell me all he wants to tell me and he's
[17:56] just going to sit here and it's okay
[17:57] maybe I need an opinion every once in a
[17:58] while from him you don't need none of
[18:00] his opinions you don't need his nonsense
[18:02] what you need is to cast him out as soon
[18:05] as he comes you have every right to get
[18:07] rid of that devil as soon as he comes
[18:09] and tells you that you're not bride as
[18:11] soon as he comes and tells you don't go
[18:13] to church on a Rainy Night cast that
[18:15] devil out if there's any way to do it
[18:16] Lord I'm going to be in the house of God
[18:18] tonight why because you're casting him
[18:20] down and if you'll just cast him down
[18:22] time and time again remember the Bible
[18:24] says you feel resist him he will flee
[18:26] for from you I believe that tonight I
[18:29] think we need to believe that tonight if
[18:30] we'll resist the devil when he comes and
[18:32] talking to you and he tries to knock on
[18:34] your door that's when you need to cast
[18:36] down reasoning cast down the devil
[18:38] that's trying to talk to you tonight do
[18:39] you believe that we are Overcomers
[18:42] because of the one who overcome Force he
[18:45] said he said now do you know we've had
[18:47] Wars after wars and rumors of wars he
[18:49] said but you realize that there's really
[18:51] only two powers in all the universe of
[18:53] all of our differences between nations
[18:54] and between each other and everything it
[18:56] all mounts up to two Powers there's only
[18:58] two Powers there's only two kingdoms two
[19:00] Powers two kingdoms all the rest the
[19:02] little minor things are connected with
[19:04] either one of these powers and those
[19:06] Powers is God's power and Satan's power
[19:09] he said every war every disorder
[19:11] everything that comes along it's either
[19:13] controlled by God's power or Satan's
[19:15] power he said because that's their only
[19:17] two Powers there is and that is the
[19:19] power of life and the power of death now
[19:21] that's the only two Powers now brother
[19:23] Brandon says that a lot there so I think
[19:25] he really wanted us to understand that
[19:26] there's only two powers in the universe
[19:29] today and Satan can only his power and
[19:32] he goes on and he kind of stutters
[19:34] through her he said he's got his
[19:35] perverted power of God it isn't no real
[19:37] power it's a perversion of God's power
[19:40] everything that Satan has death is only
[19:43] perverted life a lie is only the truth
[19:46] misthold adultery is only a an act
[19:48] misused righteous act misuse see
[19:51] everything that Satan has got something
[19:53] that was perverted but it's a power and
[19:55] we are today sitting here and one of the
[19:58] other power is going to control us
[20:00] one power or the other is going to
[20:02] control us today so you're either
[20:04] sitting here under the power of Satan or
[20:06] you're sitting here under the power of
[20:07] God and I'd much rather sit here under
[20:09] the power of God because he can heal you
[20:11] he can deliver you he can bring your
[20:13] family back but the power of Satan will
[20:15] only destroy you and he will torment
[20:18] your mind every day of your life
[20:20] and so I think it's important that we we
[20:22] cast down Satan's reasoning and his
[20:24] tactics and and take God at his word
[20:26] brother random goes on he said let's
[20:28] take our position like the stars of the
[20:29] heavens as the Bible speaks wandering
[20:32] Stars over the book of Jude foaming out
[20:34] their own shame and we don't want to be
[20:35] wandering Stars wonder if this is right
[20:37] wonder if that is right wonder if this
[20:38] will happen he said how could it be
[20:40] don't wonder stay like those stars of
[20:42] the heaven as a real soldier at his post
[20:44] of Duty stand there believing life and
[20:47] death he said now an army when a real
[20:49] army a nation makes ready to go against
[20:51] another Nation it should first go down
[20:53] and figure out what's right and wrong
[20:55] and whether they're able to go against
[20:57] that Nation or not he said Jesus taught
[20:59] that and if people would do that if
[21:01] nations would do that would sit down and
[21:03] stop and think those things both sides
[21:06] would have no more war he said we find
[21:08] out if a man doesn't do that if the
[21:10] military heads of the nation doesn't sit
[21:12] down first and figure out and see what
[21:14] they are he said their motives and the
[21:16] objectives are right and if they have
[21:18] enough strength and powers to overcome
[21:19] the next Army then they're sure to lose
[21:21] so you first got to make sure that you
[21:24] know the word you first have to make
[21:26] sure that you are in the will of God and
[21:28] if you are Satan and his power has no
[21:30] hold on you he said now therefore any
[21:32] battle can be put in a ray they first
[21:34] have to choose a meeting ground or a
[21:36] place where the battle is to be fought
[21:38] a selected place in the first world war
[21:40] it was so placed a man a No Man's Land
[21:43] places where they fought he said they've
[21:45] got to have a place selected like when
[21:47] Israel went to war with Philistines and
[21:50] there was a hill on each side where they
[21:52] gathered and that's where Goliath come
[21:54] down and called the armies of Israel he
[21:55] said that's where David met him in the
[21:57] valley when he passed over the little
[21:58] creek that run between the two hills he
[22:00] picked up the rocks and you know the
[22:01] story and he said there's Mutual ground
[22:03] No Man's Land he said and they fight
[22:05] here at this place they just don't fight
[22:07] one over here and one over maybe that's
[22:08] why Satan fights the mind that's no
[22:10] man's land for some of us and so he said
[22:13] they just don't fight one over here and
[22:14] one down here and run one over here he
[22:16] said that's a Battlefront where they
[22:17] meet and test their powers where each
[22:19] Army tested strength against the other
[22:21] Army a mutual meeting place he said now
[22:23] don't miss this when this great battle
[22:25] started on Earth there had to be a
[22:27] mutual meeting place there had to be a
[22:29] place selected for the battle to begin
[22:31] and for the battle to rage how many
[22:33] knows that and that battled ground
[22:35] begins in the human mind
[22:38] now I know that was a lot right there
[22:40] but you have to think about it it's just
[22:42] like a real battle it's just like a real
[22:43] war going on and it's constantly going
[22:45] on in your mind in my mind in all of our
[22:47] minds and he said that Battleground
[22:49] begins in the mind he said there is
[22:51] where the battle starts the human mind
[22:53] was chosen for that place of battle he
[22:56] said where it was to begin and that is
[22:58] because that decisions are made from the
[23:00] mind he said now he said now they never
[23:03] started it from some organization they
[23:05] never started it from the mechanical
[23:07] Affair the grounds never started there
[23:09] he said therefore that organization can
[23:10] never do the work of God because the
[23:13] Battlegrounds where you've got to meet
[23:15] your enemy is in the mind you've got to
[23:18] make your choice I believe there is a
[23:20] choice we've got to make tonight we are
[23:22] going to serve God where are we going to
[23:23] obey obey the voices in our head that
[23:25] are trying to tell us to go ahead and
[23:27] just go back a little bit it won't hurt
[23:28] us to backslide just a little and it
[23:31] won't hurt us to give up just a little
[23:32] bit here and and to let let loose a
[23:34] little bit over here and to give ground
[23:36] a little bit to the devil don't give the
[23:38] devil one inch of ground but come on
[23:40] under the subjection of the word of God
[23:42] and watch God move in your life watch
[23:44] God come on the scene when you need him
[23:46] the most because anybody brother says
[23:48] inside of the body is the soul and that
[23:50] soul is controlled by imaginations
[23:52] conscience memory reasons and affections
[23:54] he said that's the thing that controls
[23:57] the soul but the spirit only has one
[23:59] sense the spirit he said oh let's get it
[24:02] the spirit has one sense and that sense
[24:04] either dominates it is Faith or doubt he
[24:08] said that's exactly and there's only one
[24:10] Avenue to it that's free moral agency
[24:12] you can accept doubt or you can accept
[24:13] Faith either one you want to work on
[24:16] therefore Satan begin at the principle
[24:18] part to cause the spirit of man to doubt
[24:20] God's word and God begin at the
[24:22] principal part to lay his word in that
[24:25] Spirit he said there you are that's what
[24:27] does it if this church right now could
[24:29] be put together knitted together with
[24:31] such that every person would be in one
[24:33] Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt
[24:35] anywhere he said there would not be a
[24:37] feeble person in our midst
[24:39] in another five minutes there would not
[24:41] be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost
[24:43] but would receive it he said if you
[24:46] could just get that certain thing fixed
[24:48] there is where the battle begins right
[24:51] in your mind whether you will now
[24:53] remember brother Brown's talking about
[24:54] the power of a thought you have to you
[24:57] have to believe that you can take God at
[24:59] his word and you have to believe then
[25:01] that the Holy Ghost is yours you have to
[25:03] believe that God is God and that when he
[25:05] promises something it will come to pass
[25:07] but you have to cast down the reasoning
[25:10] part in your mind you say well Satan is
[25:12] there and he's talking to me about the
[25:13] reasoning he's coming and telling me
[25:15] that I'm not good enough to receive the
[25:16] Holy Ghost in This day he's telling me
[25:18] I'm not good enough to walk a Christian
[25:19] life but that's the part you have to
[25:22] cast down you say will he come back yes
[25:24] he will but you cast him down every time
[25:26] and you tell him he can't stay around
[25:28] anymore don't let him make a home in
[25:30] your mind and tell you how bad you are
[25:32] you are the Overcomers you are the Bride
[25:35] of laodicea that were called out for
[25:37] this age I think it's time we quit
[25:39] playing with the devil quit playing
[25:40] church and tell him it's my time to
[25:43] fight it's my time to take my stand and
[25:45] to cast The Devils out of my mind it's
[25:47] my time to show my family who I am and
[25:50] tell them I'm not just a person that
[25:51] will be tossed to and fro by every wind
[25:53] of doctrine that comes along in the
[25:55] message and tells me I should go over
[25:57] here and try to believe the the return
[25:59] of brother praying more or go over here
[26:01] and try to say well just be a tape only
[26:03] believer if you want to that's Satan
[26:05] fighting the mind of the Believers today
[26:06] but if you could just get your mind stay
[26:09] on the word of God and when that evil
[26:10] thought comes in your mind and tells you
[26:12] to give up turn around go back and lay
[26:15] down remember that's the devil cast him
[26:17] down and I believe that that devil will
[26:19] flee far from you yes he's going to come
[26:22] back yes he's going to come there and
[26:23] he's going to sit on your shoulder and
[26:25] he's going to talk all kinds of nonsense
[26:27] to you but if you'll just give the devil
[26:29] a black eye every once in a while watch
[26:31] him flee from you watch the devil run
[26:33] away from you because God is greater I
[26:35] believe Satan is scared of what you've
[26:37] got inside of you Satan is scared to
[26:39] death and he knows he can't get but
[26:41] he wants to just give you something to
[26:43] think about something to doubt with he
[26:45] wants to get in there when you need
[26:46] healing and he wants to tell you well
[26:48] there's no healing anymore brother
[26:50] branham's done gone you have to wait on
[26:52] the little room before the healing can
[26:53] take place cast that nonsense back into
[26:55] the Lake of Fire and tell him I don't
[26:57] need that no more what I need is healing
[27:00] what I need is the word of God that says
[27:02] by his stripes I am healed he didn't say
[27:04] a prophet had to be on the scene for it
[27:06] to happen he said you are healed he
[27:09] didn't say you had to wait on a man to
[27:10] return from the dead to come back in the
[27:12] resurrection and raise up oh and then he
[27:14] can come and create Limbs and create
[27:15] arms and all these things what kind of
[27:17] nonsense has the message got into
[27:19] tonight is the night we need to stand
[27:22] here and say I believe the word of God
[27:24] just like it was spoken just like it was
[27:26] written I'm not giving in to the Devil
[27:28] he's not going to tell me to sit down
[27:30] and I can't preach no more because
[27:32] that's the devil trying to get into the
[27:34] mind of the real believer
[27:36] I'm not calling a person a devil but I'm
[27:38] telling you Satan will use men Satan
[27:40] will use the internet Satan will use all
[27:42] kinds of voices and he's not going to
[27:44] give up until the very end you don't
[27:46] think he'll come in just as slick and
[27:48] Sly as he can if he came and he was
[27:50] dressed in red and he had a great big
[27:52] Pitchfork every one of us would
[27:53] recognize that was the devil and we
[27:55] could get rid of him but when he comes
[27:57] in and he looks like your brother and he
[27:59] looks like your sister and he talks to
[28:01] you and tells you you don't have to live
[28:02] this part of the message you don't have
[28:04] to do this part of the message that's
[28:06] when you need to cut that devil down
[28:08] recognize the devil know who he is and
[28:11] cut that evil thought away from you
[28:13] because he is going to battle you but
[28:15] greater is he that is in you greater is
[28:18] he that is in the bride of Christ
[28:19] greater is he that is here tonight that
[28:22] he that is in the world and I'll tell
[28:24] you tonight I believe there's a bride of
[28:26] Christ sitting here at Hardy Arkansas
[28:27] who's not going to be tossed to and fro
[28:29] by every little doctrine that comes
[28:31] around I don't care if it's out of a
[28:33] denomination I don't care if it comes
[28:34] out through the message ranks what
[28:36] whatever it comes from if it's not in
[28:38] the word recognize it as an evil spirit
[28:40] recognize it as the devil and cast it
[28:43] down can you believe that tonight I tell
[28:45] you what I think there's a power and a
[28:47] thought and if you give the devil just
[28:49] an inch to get a hold of something in
[28:51] your mind and he'll come in there and
[28:53] he'll try to plant seed of Doubt well we
[28:55] maybe we don't need the ministry anymore
[28:56] maybe we just have to press play that
[28:59] sounds reasonable but is it the word of
[29:01] God let me ask you this do we need
[29:03] church services today a prophet said I'm
[29:06] so misunderstood he said you think I
[29:08] don't believe in going to church anymore
[29:09] can you believe what he said and take
[29:12] God at his word or are you going to give
[29:14] the devil just a little Edge to get in
[29:16] their well maybe we don't need Church no
[29:18] more maybe we can sit at home and play
[29:19] tapes maybe we can stream our favorite
[29:21] preacher but he said you will assemble
[29:24] yourselves and the word of God is still
[29:26] true today I don't care what the devil
[29:28] says can we take what God said can we
[29:30] take what he said take him at his word
[29:32] and overcome every one of them Devils
[29:34] that are coming after our families and
[29:36] every one of those Devils that are
[29:37] coming into our churches and trying to
[29:39] shut the church Doors Down remember he
[29:41] said the church doors might be padlocked
[29:43] someday but you know I don't believe
[29:44] it'll be I don't believe it'll be the
[29:45] world doing such I believe it'll be
[29:47] padlocked from the people that are
[29:48] sitting here refuse to come back why do
[29:51] you need the doors open if there ain't
[29:52] nobody to come
[29:54] well come on somebody you can sit there
[29:56] all night if you want to look at me but
[29:57] let me tell you this I believe God has
[30:00] got Warriors in the message of the hour
[30:02] I don't believe he called a bunch of
[30:04] sissies to join the message of the hour
[30:06] he didn't call a bunch of people who
[30:09] couldn't stand in the day of evil and
[30:12] who couldn't stand against The Wiles of
[30:13] the devil but he said in this day that's
[30:16] when you have to stand he said stand
[30:18] therefore with your law and skirt about
[30:20] with truth and I believe tonight that we
[30:23] have the truth of the hour I believe we
[30:25] know the truth of the hour but what is
[30:27] it it's important to know that when the
[30:29] Devil Comes among you and tries to tries
[30:31] to break this thing up his brother
[30:33] Brandon said he would try to come in and
[30:35] try to preach false doctrines to you and
[30:37] tell you you don't have to do this and
[30:39] you don't have to do that and a man can
[30:42] stand in the Pulpit be married two or
[30:43] three times well go ahead and say
[30:45] something you can say yes or no but
[30:47] listen to me when the prophet said it
[30:49] it's true when the Bible says it I can
[30:53] hang my soul on it because it's true
[30:55] anyway I don't care what some preacher
[30:58] tells me I don't care what some internet
[30:59] person tells me I can tell you what the
[31:02] word of God said and the word of God
[31:04] said to cast down reasoning he said to
[31:07] get rid of those Devils that come and
[31:08] sit on your shoulder remember the birds
[31:10] can come in and they can Roost there or
[31:12] they can come there to your mind but
[31:14] they don't have to roost there and I
[31:16] heard a brother say and I kind of liked
[31:17] it he said you can take your double
[31:19] barrel shotgun with 66 books of the
[31:21] Bible and you can blow them Devils away
[31:24] and I love that tonight I think that's
[31:26] the time that's the type of Christian we
[31:28] need that's not afraid to fight for the
[31:30] god-given rights that you have not
[31:31] afraid to fight the the devil that's
[31:34] going to come in this day oh he's going
[31:35] to come after you he's going to come
[31:37] after your family he's going to come
[31:38] after the church he's going to come
[31:40] after the pastor and every one of you
[31:42] sitting there tonight Satan is trying to
[31:44] get a hold of you and telling you you
[31:46] don't need to go to church and if you do
[31:48] show up you don't have to participate
[31:49] eight all you got to do is just sit
[31:51] there and just mark it off the calendar
[31:53] well I went to church twice this week or
[31:55] I went three times this week I'm doing a
[31:57] pretty good job no you need to get
[31:59] serious with God and believe the word of
[32:01] God we're not here just for a picnic but
[32:03] we're here to fight a battle we're here
[32:05] to fight the battle that is going on in
[32:07] every one of our minds and I think
[32:09] tonight is time that we quit playing
[32:11] around with that devil when he comes in
[32:13] it's time to cast him down with all that
[32:16] you've got if he tells you well I don't
[32:18] need to play tapes in my home anymore
[32:19] and I just need to not listen to that
[32:22] because you know the the kids aren't
[32:23] interested and I'll just go turn on the
[32:25] TV instead cast down that devil go ahead
[32:28] and turn on the tape in your home why
[32:30] don't you get the family together and
[32:32] pray a little bit I tell you Satan
[32:34] fights every one of us in that
[32:35] department
[32:37] um yeah every one of us when you go to
[32:39] pray you try to get your family together
[32:40] you're either too busy or Satan will try
[32:42] to tell you there's not enough time in a
[32:44] day you've got to get to work on time
[32:45] I'm telling you it's time that we had
[32:47] parents that will get together and get
[32:50] their family together and try to have
[32:52] prayer again in the home I think it's
[32:53] time for the family altar to take place
[32:56] of the TV
[32:57] well what if it did what kind of a home
[32:59] could we have
[33:01] how spiritual could we be when we come
[33:03] to the house of God if we put him first
[33:07] I know this is a little crazy
[33:10] but it's the message of the hour it's
[33:12] what he taught us
[33:14] he told us not to give in
[33:16] and I believe it's a positive message
[33:18] you say that sounds like a bunch of
[33:20] rules and regulations it's a positive
[33:22] message because this is a way to defeat
[33:24] Satan
[33:26] anywhere on any grounds
[33:29] and that's what we need to do tonight is
[33:31] to defeat Satan and because he is going
[33:34] to fight you I think we can agree on
[33:36] that
[33:37] brother Bram says this never permit a
[33:39] negative thought to come to your mind if
[33:41] you can help it
[33:44] he said when it starts don't entertain
[33:46] it
[33:48] will you say I can't help the thoughts
[33:50] from coming he said well that'll be like
[33:52] the farmer that said he couldn't stop
[33:53] the birds from flying over his place but
[33:55] he could sure stop them from roosting
[33:57] he said that's a good thing you see you
[33:59] can't help the thoughts when they come
[34:01] right and you can't
[34:03] Satan is always constantly filling your
[34:05] mind with some sort of a thought and
[34:07] it's not always good
[34:09] right but you don't have
[34:10] to entertain the thought
[34:14] right we don't have to entertain every
[34:16] thought that comes to our mind
[34:18] truth he said you don't entertain them
[34:21] just pass it on
[34:23] he said no sir Jesus Christ is my savior
[34:25] all things are mined by God and I'm
[34:27] going to keep them I'm going to testify
[34:30] of him he said God can only bless you as
[34:32] you confess that he has done it for you
[34:34] see he's the high priest of your
[34:36] confession Hebrews he said he said that
[34:39] he's the high priest of our confession
[34:40] he can only do for us as we accept it
[34:43] and believe it and confess it
[34:46] and brother Branham goes on he said it's
[34:48] not a Christian Science Mind Over Matter
[34:51] he said the mind accepts life which is
[34:53] the word of God
[34:54] he said and there brings to life just
[34:56] your thought doesn't do it but the word
[34:58] of God brought in the channel of your
[35:00] thoughts see it's not as the thought as
[35:03] a Christian Science make it Mind Over
[35:04] Matter but your mind accepts it it
[35:07] grasps it what your mind controls by
[35:09] what is your mind controlled by your
[35:11] spirit and your spirit catches the word
[35:14] of God and that's the thing that's got
[35:16] life in it do you believe that tonight
[35:18] that's the thing that's got life in it
[35:20] it brings life into you he said oh
[35:23] brother when that takes place when life
[35:25] comes down that channel into you the
[35:28] word of God is manifesting you if you
[35:30] abide in me and my words in you he said
[35:33] then ask what you will and it'll be done
[35:35] for you he said then he said then what
[35:38] does that do from the middle of the
[35:40] heart which is the soul from There Goes
[35:42] Forth feeding every channel he said the
[35:44] trouble of it is we're standing in here
[35:46] with a lot of Doubt trying to accept
[35:48] what's out there you've got to stop that
[35:51] and come down that Channel with the true
[35:53] word of God he said and then it goes out
[35:55] itself automatically I'd like to say
[35:58] that again if you'll get under the real
[36:00] channel of God we're standing here in a
[36:02] lot of doubt he said trying to accept
[36:03] what's out there he said stop up that
[36:06] come down to that Channel with the true
[36:07] word of God and then it goes out itself
[36:10] automatically
[36:14] think about that for just a second
[36:16] when you have the true spirit of God in
[36:19] you
[36:20] the thoughts cannot Roost there
[36:23] right it goes out itself automatically
[36:27] he said it's what's on the inside that's
[36:30] the thing that counts is the inside
[36:32] Satan's approach is from the inside
[36:36] and he is the one that torments your
[36:37] mind
[36:38] when you know you've went to the Altar
[36:40] and and you've had your hands laid on
[36:42] you
[36:43] and you uh you've been prayed for
[36:46] right and you believed that you were
[36:48] healed
[36:49] any if you walk away from there
[36:52] Satan is bound and determined to tell
[36:54] you were never healed when you went up
[36:55] there
[36:57] he is uh it is his duty and his job to
[37:00] tell you that if you lay hands on the
[37:02] sick they will not recover
[37:04] right that's his job it's his job to
[37:08] tell you that the ministry does not need
[37:09] to be in the Pulpit today
[37:10] it's his job to tell you that we don't
[37:12] need to gather together as a body of
[37:14] Believers today it is his job to tell
[37:16] you
[37:17] that evil spirits cannot be cast out of
[37:20] the people
[37:21] but God had a different idea
[37:24] and when he gave you something he gave
[37:27] you not only a thought
[37:29] he gave you a spirit to fight Satan's
[37:32] Thoughts with
[37:34] because greater is the spirit of Christ
[37:36] in you
[37:37] then the thoughts that Satan tries to
[37:39] bring into your mind
[37:40] and so Satan will tell you all these bad
[37:44] things but I believe he said now he said
[37:46] now you say I don't steal I don't drink
[37:48] I don't do these things he said that has
[37:50] nothing to do with it it's the inside
[37:54] no matter how good you are how moral you
[37:56] are how truthful you are those things
[37:58] are respected but Jesus said except the
[38:00] man be born again see there's got to be
[38:02] something happen inside if you don't
[38:05] that's artificial put on for down in
[38:08] your heart you desire to do it anyhow it
[38:10] can't be artificial it's got to be real
[38:13] so how do we overcome the evil thoughts
[38:16] of the devil in this day
[38:18] by the Holy Ghost
[38:20] how do we overcome the evil that is
[38:22] going to constantly come and remind us
[38:24] who we're not by the Holy Ghost and when
[38:27] the Holy Ghost is in you then you can't
[38:30] dwell on those thoughts any longer
[38:32] when the Holy Ghost comes in you you
[38:35] can't dwell on the thought that my
[38:37] children can never be saved you can't
[38:39] dwell on the thought that I can't be
[38:40] healed now the thought can come the
[38:43] thought can come and it can it can
[38:44] affect you and it can battle you every
[38:46] day but it cannot stay there if the real
[38:49] Holy Ghost is on the inside because the
[38:51] Holy Ghost in you will rise up and drive
[38:54] that thought away you see where I'm
[38:56] going with this I hope because I I think
[38:58] you'll understand the Mind battles will
[39:00] always come we are going to fight Satan
[39:02] every day of Our Lives there's nothing
[39:03] we can do about that but what we can do
[39:05] to keep the things from sitting there
[39:07] and destroying us ruining our lives is
[39:11] to have the Holy Ghost on the inside to
[39:13] counter what Satan is always trying to
[39:15] bring on us and I think if you'll see
[39:17] that there is a power and a positive
[39:19] thought there is power in thinking that
[39:22] what you what you have is real there's
[39:24] power and you not being depressed all
[39:27] the time there's power in you not
[39:29] admitting your depression you say well I
[39:31] had a bad day yesterday and you just
[39:33] keep talking about it and I'm probably
[39:35] you know I've often said this and
[39:37] Isaac's going to correct me on this
[39:38] later because I'm preaching something I
[39:39] better live but you know sometimes on
[39:41] Wednesday that's the third Monday of
[39:43] this week
[39:44] I mean that's just the way some weeks go
[39:46] and and but you know it would do us a
[39:48] lot better it do us a lot more good if
[39:50] we would actually dwell on the positives
[39:52] of life and you now I'm not up here
[39:54] trying to tell you you know positivity
[39:55] is going to save you it's not but I
[39:58] believe a Christian should always have a
[40:00] positive testimony
[40:02] brother Brandon goes on here and he said
[40:03] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[40:05] if you say to this mountain move and
[40:06] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[40:07] what you have said will come to pass
[40:10] now I want you to notice what you have
[40:12] said will come to pass now you were
[40:14] positive about it the mountain can still
[40:16] be standing there there could still be
[40:18] obstacles in your way
[40:19] but the mountain will move because you
[40:21] said so
[40:22] there's power and a thought when you
[40:24] have the thought you speak it sometimes
[40:26] like if you're like me we speak before
[40:28] the thought gets there but you see what
[40:30] I'm saying we should have a real
[40:32] positive thought towards the promises of
[40:35] God
[40:36] and brother Brown goes on he said he
[40:38] said you get it he said there you are
[40:39] there's the Battlegrounds if you'd only
[40:42] get that started first
[40:44] he said well what's the matter with our
[40:46] Pentecostal faith today we've let too
[40:47] many things hinder it we've let too many
[40:50] things looking at somebody else and the
[40:52] devil is always trying to point you to
[40:54] somebody's failure but he tries to keep
[40:57] you away from the real testimony that's
[40:59] genuine he'll point you to a hypocrite
[41:02] he'll point you to someone impersonating
[41:04] something he didn't do it because he was
[41:06] impersonating but if it come from the
[41:08] true source of the word of God heavens
[41:11] and earth will pass away but my word
[41:13] cannot pass away it's got to stay there
[41:15] it must be accepted in the mind then
[41:18] it's believed in the heart
[41:20] now that's bringing it down to where I
[41:22] want to get to tonight we must accept
[41:24] the truth of the word in our mind and
[41:27] then it will come down and take place in
[41:28] our hearts he said then the word of God
[41:31] becomes a reality to us every senses of
[41:34] the soul and body is just scoured out
[41:36] with the Holy Spirit then your sense of
[41:39] God your conscience of God everything
[41:41] that's Godly flows through you there's
[41:44] not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can
[41:46] rise up there's nothing can come up in
[41:49] the memory say well I remember Miss
[41:50] Jones tried to trust God and miss so and
[41:53] so try to trust God for healing one time
[41:55] and she failed he said but if that
[41:57] channel has been cleared out and been
[41:59] purged
[42:00] and been filled on the inside with the
[42:02] holy spirit that don't even come to the
[42:04] memory anymore he said no matter about
[42:06] Mrs Jones or what she did it's you and
[42:09] God together so you say somebody died of
[42:12] cancer but I don't have to somebody lost
[42:14] their children to the world I don't have
[42:16] to
[42:17] it also goes for you that have lost your
[42:20] children they're coming back and we went
[42:22] over that before and I believe that's I
[42:24] believe that's the message of the hour I
[42:25] believe they're coming back don't you
[42:27] doubt that and he said but there's your
[42:29] battle he said kill him at the beginning
[42:31] stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how
[42:34] long you can make the war linger it's
[42:36] stop it right now
[42:38] I like that part don't let the devil sit
[42:41] there and don't just say well I'm just
[42:42] going to fight with him a little bit no
[42:44] because he'll bring you down so low that
[42:46] you'll lose your strength to fight him
[42:48] anymore but if you'll cast him down when
[42:50] he first gets there that's why we must
[42:52] recognize when the devil's showing up if
[42:54] he's telling you something negative
[42:56] about yourself then it's the devil
[42:58] because you are children of God and God
[43:00] does not go around telling his children
[43:02] how bad they are now he will correct you
[43:05] and you'll know what is his correction
[43:06] because you'll remember what you did
[43:08] wrong you'll remember those things but
[43:10] remember once it's confessed that it's
[43:12] under the Blood cast that thing out of
[43:14] your mind and quit dwelling on it and go
[43:16] forward and believe that I am a Son of
[43:18] God and when Satan tries to come and
[43:20] reminding you of some past wrong or some
[43:23] little thing in your past history you
[43:25] say Satan that is in the sea of God's
[43:27] forgetfulness I don't remember it no
[43:29] more God don't remember it no more the
[43:31] church don't remember it no more why
[43:33] because it's been forgiven and I forgive
[43:36] them and they forgive me God has
[43:38] forgiven us it's time we just quit
[43:40] holding on to little grudges and little
[43:42] things around the church you say well so
[43:44] and so did me wrong 20 years ago well I
[43:46] don't care if they did or not you better
[43:48] forgive them or you're never going
[43:49] anywhere you've got to forgive your
[43:51] enemy you've got to do good to those
[43:53] that try to falsely accuse you and
[43:55] persecute you and do all these things
[43:57] you say well so and so you know they
[43:59] they hurt me they hurt my feelings every
[44:01] time they show up at church they try to
[44:03] do something to rub me the wrong way
[44:04] well brother maybe God put that person
[44:06] there for a reason
[44:08] maybe he put that person there so he
[44:10] could rub those rough rough edges off of
[44:12] you and bring you under subjection of
[44:14] the Holy Ghost remember we're always
[44:16] trying to find little reasons why we
[44:18] can't live a good Christian life but I
[44:20] think if we would just recognize it's
[44:22] the devil and cast him down when he gets
[44:24] there we can live a Victorious Life In
[44:27] Christ brother ramp tells us don't
[44:29] despise where God has got you serve your
[44:31] purpose there's coming a great Victory
[44:34] Day one of these days where the battle
[44:35] is over oh I hope you see that tonight
[44:37] there's coming a victory day today may
[44:40] not be that day for your body because
[44:42] your body and your soul and your spirit
[44:44] they're all put here for a purpose and
[44:46] your body is going to fight sickness and
[44:48] your mind is going to fight the devil
[44:50] but your soul can be anchored in Jesus
[44:52] and that's where we need to be denied I
[44:55] said I'm Anchored In Jesus the storms of
[44:57] life are going to come we're going to
[44:59] Brave every one of them because we're
[45:00] anchored in the Rock of Ages but listen
[45:02] to me Satan's going to come he's going
[45:05] to talk to you he's going to try to
[45:06] destroy you and your marriage and your
[45:08] children but greater is he that is in
[45:11] you than he that is battling your mind
[45:13] tonight greater is he that is trying to
[45:15] take over your life maybe you're a
[45:17] married couple maybe you're maybe you've
[45:19] got a family and maybe Satan is trying
[45:21] to come in and he's trying to use the
[45:22] internet to try try to get in there and
[45:24] break you up and break make you cold
[45:25] towards one another cast down that devil
[45:28] you say well I don't want to get rid of
[45:29] the internet maybe I use it for work but
[45:31] don't you don't have to dwell on it so
[45:33] much and use that devil you say well if
[45:36] I know something's killing me if I knew
[45:38] that there was something I was eating
[45:40] that was killing me and a doctor said if
[45:41] you eat that you're going to die would I
[45:43] continue to eat it and if I did
[45:45] I would be committing suicide right
[45:49] but if I told you
[45:51] that your lack of prayer life
[45:53] and your lack of study in the scriptures
[45:55] and your lack of hearing the message of
[45:56] the hour was going to kill you
[45:58] what would you do
[46:00] study more pray more hear the word more
[46:03] right
[46:04] if I told you that that that that
[46:06] pornography would ruin a marriage
[46:09] and it will
[46:10] then you would stop doing it right but
[46:13] no Satan will come around and constantly
[46:15] try to bring that back
[46:17] Satan is always at work Satan is always
[46:20] trying to to defeat God's children
[46:22] knowing good and well he can't do it and
[46:25] you know he tries to come in and he
[46:27] knows he can't get you in a certain way
[46:28] because you've overcome this and you've
[46:30] overcome that and you've overcome All
[46:32] These Little Devils that have come after
[46:34] you and so he'll come a different way
[46:36] and that's why we must recognize who he
[46:39] is if it's anything outside of the word
[46:42] of God it is a distraction to you and it
[46:45] is the devil trying to get you away from
[46:47] the word of God let me get on down here
[46:49] my time is up but brother Brandon says
[46:51] he said those disappointments are God's
[46:53] Divine will happening for us it doesn't
[46:56] seem like it would be that but it's
[46:58] God's way of doing things he's let us
[46:59] hit this river to see what we'll do
[47:01] Moses led the children of Israel right
[47:03] right behind him and the dust boiling
[47:05] from a half a million men in arms and
[47:07] there was two million helpless Jews with
[47:09] nothing standing there men women and
[47:11] children and so forth and the Red Sea
[47:13] had cut him off the Dead Sea had cut him
[47:14] off he said there's no place to go but
[47:16] Moses had a victory day when he prayed
[47:19] through and we can have a victory day
[47:21] when we pray through he said Moses had
[47:24] that Victory Day see he said but Moses
[47:26] he said he and he began he went and
[47:28] began to cry out to the Lord and the
[47:29] Lord said why are you crying to me I
[47:31] commission you to do it speak to the
[47:33] children and they go in that line of
[47:35] duty he said there you are don't cry out
[47:37] to me your commissioned to take these
[47:39] people over just speak to them that they
[47:41] go forward he said stay right in the
[47:43] path of Duty what a courage that ought
[47:46] to be for the sick person what
[47:47] encouraged it ought to be for the
[47:49] backslider turn yourself around and
[47:51] start back stay in the line of duty it's
[47:54] God's business to open up the Red Seas
[47:56] it's God's business you just speak and
[47:59] move forward that's all you have to do
[48:03] so I don't have to dwell on the thoughts
[48:05] I don't have to dwell on the things that
[48:07] are constantly coming against me but I
[48:09] can speak and go forward because I know
[48:11] who I am you know who you are you've
[48:14] been positioned by the message of the
[48:15] hour you've been shown your place in God
[48:17] and you don't have to give in to the
[48:19] devil any longer aren't you thankful for
[48:21] that I believe that we should cast out
[48:23] the devil and when he tries to to to to
[48:26] tell you boo I think we should just tell
[48:28] him boo back you know just get rid of
[48:30] that devil and he said now what is the
[48:31] word of God he said the word of God is
[48:33] God himself so God gave the believer
[48:36] himself I love that I hope you maybe you
[48:39] didn't hear me God gave the believer
[48:41] himself God is the word God is God
[48:46] himself he said he gave the believer
[48:48] himself to attack the Enemy by in other
[48:50] words he's the Father the word is God
[48:53] then the word is our father we're born
[48:55] by the word and he's standing in the
[48:58] Forefront for his children
[49:00] he said there you are he's standing out
[49:03] there for his children what are we
[49:05] scared about the Rapture is sure the
[49:07] coming is sure every blessing that's
[49:10] been promised is ours It All Belongs to
[49:12] us so what are we scared because the
[49:14] devil is constantly telling you you
[49:16] should be scared but greater is he
[49:19] that is in you
[49:20] then he that's telling you that you got
[49:23] to be scared when a message could come
[49:25] and say what are you scared about it all
[49:27] belongs to us
[49:29] and I'll go on down here brother Brian
[49:30] said when you get out from behind that
[49:32] like Eve did he's talking about the word
[49:33] she was behind the word but when you get
[49:36] out from behind that like Eve did the
[49:37] Battle Is Lost he said now poor Eve she
[49:40] listened and she lost her place and and
[49:43] I would like you to think about that now
[49:44] for just a second brother Branham
[49:46] actually talks to this woman
[49:48] and she asked the question excuse me
[49:50] yeah this woman she asked a question
[49:51] brother Brandon what will we do
[49:53] something has settled over me I can't
[49:54] break it she had a dream that she was
[49:57] lost in white sand and it's getting dark
[50:00] couldn't find my way in this dream has
[50:02] stayed with me and and this dream was
[50:03] tormenting her now remember Satan can
[50:06] come to you in a dream
[50:07] this woman had this dream and she told
[50:09] brother Brandon she asked him what to do
[50:11] about this dream he said now
[50:14] now I am groping in darkness my son and
[50:16] his wife were included in my dream now
[50:18] they are also in darkness and we are
[50:21] desperate we are in desperation I
[50:23] believe God will show you what is in our
[50:25] hearts
[50:26] brother Brandon goes on and answers this
[50:28] question
[50:29] he said you're just letting Satan put
[50:31] one over on you
[50:32] your dream proved that there's nothing
[50:34] wrong you're only nervous and by doing
[50:36] this and thinking this you're making the
[50:38] rest of your family nervous stop doing
[50:41] it claim your god-given rights he said
[50:44] your dream proves by the interpretation
[50:46] that you're in white sand everything's
[50:47] all right it's you yourself nervous he
[50:51] said let one member of the family get
[50:52] nervous it goes to the next member and
[50:54] the next member and the first thing
[50:56] you're all fussing and going on and one
[50:57] member of the family gets kind of upset
[50:59] about something it upsets the other and
[51:01] the other and the other and the first
[51:03] thing you know the whole family is upset
[51:05] he said it's Satan
[51:07] now he recognized who it was but now
[51:10] that woman has to recognize that it's
[51:11] also Satan
[51:13] and he said it's Satan he said then if
[51:16] one member of the family rejoices let
[51:18] the rest of them Rejoice with it so
[51:20] every one of the family try to do that
[51:22] each one of you children help your papa
[51:24] help your mama he said try to help the
[51:27] children don't let that gloomy
[51:28] unbelieving Spirit get around you you
[51:30] are Christians you are born of the
[51:32] spirit of God you're the salt of the
[51:34] earth I love it how he lays these
[51:36] promises in here and tells you who you
[51:38] are he's telling this lady the devil
[51:39] come and told her and tormented her
[51:41] about something but he said this is who
[51:43] you are this is what you need to
[51:45] remember that don't listen to what the
[51:47] devil had it may come by way of dream it
[51:50] might might come by look maybe look very
[51:51] Supernatural to you it might come by a
[51:53] preacher in the Pulpit it may come by a
[51:55] friend or a family member but if it's
[51:58] against the word of God and if it's
[51:59] telling you that you're not something
[52:01] that you know you are cast that devil
[52:04] aside
[52:05] he said you're the salt of the earth you
[52:07] have god-given rights and the Bible said
[52:09] if there be any praise if there be any
[52:12] virtue think on these things don't think
[52:15] about the wrong things
[52:19] and so brother Brandon goes on and I'm
[52:21] just about to close here I promise
[52:24] he said I need your strength for my
[52:27] health
[52:27] I cannot go forward without you I now
[52:29] accept you as my healer he's praying
[52:30] this prayer he said I renounce the devil
[52:33] in all of his works from this time
[52:35] henceforth I will think positive I will
[52:39] believe every promise
[52:42] is it important to think positive it is
[52:44] important it's important not to let a
[52:46] negative thought from the devil sit
[52:49] there in your mind it will it will
[52:50] torment you it will hurt your family he
[52:53] said it'll make one nervous then it'll
[52:54] go to the next it'll make your entire
[52:56] household a nervous wreck
[52:57] because you gave in to one spirit that
[53:00] is trying to attack you
[53:02] he said now I renounce the devil in all
[53:04] of his works from this time henceforth I
[53:06] will think positive I will believe every
[53:09] promise he said by his stripes I was
[53:12] healed I now accept it I believe it it
[53:15] is mine he said I thank you Lord I will
[53:17] continue testifying on my healing until
[53:20] I'm perfectly well
[53:24] I would like to this last quote and the
[53:26] musicians could come
[53:27] he said don't have a negative testimony
[53:30] every time you confess
[53:32] he said well I still feel bad today he
[53:34] said you go right straight back to that
[53:36] same rut that you was in the beginning
[53:38] he said there's not a man or a woman in
[53:39] here that is baptized with the Holy
[53:41] Spirit but what would start your
[53:43] confession
[53:44] he said I believe I've lost the Holy
[53:46] Spirit I believe it's gone from me I
[53:47] believe I believe he said you'll go
[53:48] right down you'll never claim he said
[53:50] listen You'll never live above your
[53:54] confession
[53:57] brother random says this I'll never have
[54:00] a negative testimony no more
[54:02] I'm going to believe the Lord will you
[54:04] raise your hands and say I believe that
[54:06] and I now confess that he said God bless
[54:09] you I wonder if we could do the same
[54:10] thing today
[54:12] I will never have a negative testimony
[54:14] no more I am what God Said I am he said
[54:18] you're the salt of the earth he said
[54:19] you're children of God your children of
[54:21] the promise you are the Royal Seed of
[54:23] Abraham you are the bride of Christ in
[54:26] the last day you are who God says you
[54:28] are not what Satan has tried to tell you
[54:30] are he's tried to bring you down he's
[54:33] tried to destroy your family and destroy
[54:35] your mind but today is the day of
[54:37] restoration today is the day of healing
[54:40] today is the day when your family can
[54:42] come back today is the day that we
[54:44] renounce every devil and everything that
[54:46] he has to bring against us I think it's
[54:48] time that we stand up and say I am not
[54:50] giving in one inch to that devil no more
[54:53] I'm not going to listen when he comes on
[54:55] my property because I am one of gods and
[54:58] you can't touch me devil I wonder if we
[55:00] can stand like that and say I'm going to
[55:02] be bold I'm going to be strong in the
[55:05] Lord I'm not letting the devil come my
[55:07] way no more I'm not ever letting Satan
[55:09] put a thought in my mind that I'm not
[55:11] good enough I don't care what the flesh
[55:12] looks like I don't care how many
[55:14] mistakes I've made but God God is a God
[55:16] that will forgive me God is the god that
[55:19] will heal me God is a God who is just
[55:21] but he's also faithful and he loves me I
[55:24] think we should have that as our
[55:25] testimony I am a Son of God I am a
[55:28] daughter of God and I wonder if you
[55:31] could stand tonight and say this with
[55:32] all your hearts Satan get behind me
[55:35] Satan get out of my life Satan get out
[55:38] of my family Satan get out of my
[55:40] marriage Satan get off of my children
[55:42] it's time to take back your land tonight
[55:45] it's time to get the devil running away
[55:48] from you quit letting him come in and
[55:50] sit with you but run that devil right
[55:52] back to hell where he came from do you
[55:54] believe it tonight you believe it
[55:56] tonight tell God thank you for healing
[55:59] me thank you for saving my family thank
[56:02] you for delivering me from the evil
[56:04] works of darkness thank you Jesus and I
[56:07] think if that's our testimony nothing
[56:09] can stop us from moving forward nothing
[56:12] can stop us any longer because we're
[56:14] Chosen and loved by God God aren't you
[56:16] thankful we are blessed we are highly
[56:19] favored we are his children you believe
[56:21] it tonight let's just play something
[56:23] tonight if there's a need among you if
[56:25] Satan's sitting there tonight telling
[56:27] you who you're not trying to tell you
[56:29] you're not one of God's children telling
[56:32] you can't overcome I think this is your
[56:34] night
[56:35] cast down that devil cast down reasoning
[56:38] don't even let him have a moment to talk
[56:41] to you
[56:42] as soon as he comes recognize it's the
[56:45] devil
[56:46] recognize it
[56:49] make your confession a positive one
[56:52] let the weak say I'm strong tonight
[56:55] let the poor say I'm rich in love I'm
[56:58] rich in faith
[56:59] I'm rich in favor with God
[57:02] there's nothing can stop me tonight
[57:03] nothing can turn me around with your
[57:05] heads bowed
[57:06] I wonder
[57:08] if there be one Among Us you're more
[57:09] than welcome to come to the altar you
[57:11] can raise your hand where you're sitting
[57:14] tell God I'm sorry for having a negative
[57:17] testimony in my life
[57:20] I'm sorry for the things that I've done
[57:22] wrong
[57:24] and Lord I'm not going to let that devil
[57:26] Roost there any longer
[57:29] I'm going to shoot him down
[57:32] every time he shows up
[57:34] you say brother Joel he's gonna he
[57:36] showed up this morning and he showed up
[57:37] this afternoon and he showed up
[57:39] yesterday and no doubt he'll show up
[57:40] tomorrow
[57:43] but there's a promise that what is in
[57:45] you is greater than what is in the world
[57:51] whatsoever things are good
[57:53] whatsoever things
[57:56] are true whatsoever things are honest
[58:00] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[58:02] things are pure
[58:04] whatsoever things are lovely
[58:07] whatsoever things are of a good report
[58:11] if there be any virtue if there be any
[58:14] praise think on these things
[58:17] I wonder if we can think on these things
[58:18] now
[58:19] Satan's gonna constantly come Among Us
[58:22] and try to tell us different things
[58:24] but I wonder if we could just think on
[58:26] the things that God has given us
[58:28] say thank you Jesus for the grace that
[58:30] you've given me thank you for the love
[58:32] you've showed in my life thank you for
[58:34] my children you say well don't look like
[58:36] they're here but thank you anyway
[58:37] because they're coming
[58:40] if you just believe that and continue to
[58:42] confess it the faith of Abraham being
[58:44] Abraham's seed I believe it'll come to
[58:46] pass if you believe with all your hearts
[58:48] just sing tonight with all your hearts
[58:50] now oh I pledge
[58:53] allegiance to
