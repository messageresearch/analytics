[40:01] morning we pray
[40:02] thank you for all you do in jesus name
[40:07] amen amen do you love him this morning
[40:11] i want to read from matthew 24
[40:14] we'll begin with verse 37
[40:22] matthew 24 37
[40:26] but as the days of noah were so shall
[40:28] also the coming of the son of man be
[40:34] as in the days that were before the
[40:36] flood they were eating and drinking
[40:38] marrying and giving in marriage until
[40:40] the day that noah entered into the ark
[40:42] and knew not until the flood came and
[40:44] took them all away
[40:46] so shall also the coming of the son of
[40:49] man be
[40:51] then shall two be in the field the one
[40:52] should be taken and the other left
[40:56] two women should be grinding at the mill
[40:58] the one should be taken and the other
[41:00] left
[41:01] watch therefore for you know not what
[41:04] hour
[41:06] your lord doth come i pray the lord
[41:08] without his blessings to the word you
[41:09] may be seated
[41:12] this morning
[41:22] we preached a couple of weeks ago
[41:23] several weeks ago actually on
[41:26] end time expectations and i want to pick
[41:28] that up again this morning
[41:30] what should we expect at the end
[41:34] time between now and the end knowing the
[41:36] things that we know
[41:37] and the things that have come to pass
[41:39] and the
[41:40] uh the prophet that has came and the
[41:43] opening of the word and all of those
[41:44] things
[41:45] what should we now expect what should we
[41:48] be looking for
[41:50] at the time of the end we found out
[41:53] last time that we should expect to be
[41:55] awake while others sleep and the
[41:57] important thing here is
[41:58] that jesus constantly reinforces to his
[42:01] disciples is
[42:02] watch watch and pray watch be
[42:05] be awake be ready don't be sleeping
[42:08] don't
[42:09] don't be groggy don't be overtaken by
[42:12] the cares
[42:14] of the world and and just the things of
[42:16] life but be ready
[42:18] when that moment comes you want to be
[42:20] ready when that time comes you
[42:22] you want to have your your spiritual
[42:24] eyesight wide open
[42:26] because it'll come at a time when you
[42:28] think not it
[42:30] it'll you won't know what hour the lord
[42:33] will come
[42:33] and and so i want to dig into that a
[42:36] little bit this morning
[42:39] and jesus is speaking to his disciples
[42:41] and he's saying
[42:42] as the days of noah were and he's
[42:45] reading the same bible that we read he's
[42:47] reading
[42:48] from genesis chapter 6. so i want us to
[42:51] take
[42:52] genesis chapter 6 this morning and look
[42:54] into it
[42:55] and see what should we expect the world
[42:57] to be like and we'll look at that kind
[42:59] of delay of foundation
[43:00] as we move through this this morning
[43:03] genesis chapter 6
[43:05] if you'll open your bible genesis
[43:06] chapter 6 and verse 1
[43:10] it says it came to pass when men begin
[43:12] to multiply
[43:13] on the face of the earth now just if you
[43:16] stop there for just a moment this is a
[43:18] great
[43:18] sign of the end time and many times what
[43:21] we're looking for
[43:22] as we've said before is not what is
[43:24] actually going to happen we're
[43:26] looking for certain things to happen
[43:28] that we've decided are going to happen
[43:29] before the end
[43:30] many of these things have already
[43:32] happened and this is one of them
[43:34] men began to multiply on the face of the
[43:37] earth
[43:38] brother branham said that is an
[43:40] absolutely flashing light
[43:43] that the day is at hand he said the very
[43:46] first word presents us with
[43:47] absolutely flashing light that the day
[43:50] is at hand
[43:51] and there's never been a time in all the
[43:54] history that there's ever been
[43:55] so many people and so quickly
[43:59] multiplying as we have
[44:02] today and listen he takes it down to
[44:05] something that seems like a minor thing
[44:08] but you see it all the time he says
[44:10] until it's hard to get a place
[44:13] to stay
[44:18] he says a great sign of the end time
[44:21] will be that it's hard to get a place
[44:24] to stay it'll be difficult to get a room
[44:30] now look why because the population will
[44:33] increase and you see that
[44:35] every time you you try to go on vacation
[44:37] and you take a trip
[44:38] and you see that it's all booked up it's
[44:41] a sign of the end time because this
[44:43] is what was happening during the days of
[44:45] noah
[44:47] the world was increasing in population
[44:49] and so brother branham says that the
[44:51] days at hand there's never been
[44:53] a time in all the history there's ever
[44:54] been so many people now think about this
[44:56] for just a moment
[44:57] if you look at a graph of history you
[45:00] look at
[45:00] how history has the population has went
[45:03] it went like
[45:04] this for thousands of years and then it
[45:06] went up
[45:07] in the last hundred years it's went
[45:09] straight up
[45:10] and between the time brother branham
[45:12] said this in 1963
[45:14] and today the population of the world
[45:17] has doubled
[45:21] doubled that's billions and billions
[45:25] more people are you with me this morning
[45:28] billions and billions more people you
[45:30] said brother ben i was looking for this
[45:31] to happen or that to happen
[45:33] but this is what jesus said would happen
[45:35] as the days of noah were
[45:37] men began to multiply on the face of the
[45:40] earth
[45:41] so all those people on the face of the
[45:44] earth men multiplying let's continue to
[45:45] read
[45:46] it says and daughters were born unto
[45:49] them genesis 6 1
[45:51] daughters were born unto them verse 2
[45:54] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[45:58] of men
[45:59] that they were fair now
[46:02] have you noticed brother branham says
[46:04] the increase of beauty
[46:06] of women in this day
[46:10] all the sisters said amen
[46:14] but you know he's talking about the
[46:16] increase of beauty now he's not talking
[46:17] about
[46:18] specific people being more beautiful
[46:20] because there's always been
[46:21] some people that are born with different
[46:23] kinds of looks and
[46:25] what the world would call beautiful but
[46:28] that is it's not that as much as it is
[46:31] the
[46:31] average person being able to make
[46:34] themselves
[46:35] beautiful being able to beautify
[46:38] themselves in such a way
[46:41] that the prettiest woman brother brown
[46:44] said when he was a young man
[46:46] that the prettiest woman was pearl
[46:47] o'brien he said there isn't a teenage
[46:50] girl
[46:50] in this school but would outshadow her
[46:53] when it comes to beauty
[46:55] and we see that today that that's went
[46:57] up and up and you look at the girls even
[46:58] from the 60s
[46:59] and then look at today and what's going
[47:01] on but it's they perfected the ability
[47:05] you might see it this way they perfected
[47:06] the art of putting on a mask
[47:10] putting on makeup but putting on putting
[47:13] on
[47:14] clothes that will enable them to attract
[47:16] the attention of a man
[47:19] and we could we could stop here and we
[47:21] could preach all day about this but i
[47:22] won't do that you know you
[47:24] you have the holy ghost if you don't
[47:25] have it you need to you need to be
[47:27] seeking for it
[47:28] because the holy ghost ought to be able
[47:30] to keep you in a place where
[47:31] your goal in the way that you're
[47:32] dressing the way that you're looking is
[47:34] not to attract the attention of the
[47:36] opposite sense
[47:38] right the holy ghost actually cares
[47:40] about that why because as it was in the
[47:42] days of noah
[47:43] this is what caused the increase of sin
[47:46] the increase of beauty the sons of god
[47:49] saw the daughters of men
[47:51] that they were fair they had learned how
[47:53] to beautify themselves how to act how to
[47:55] wear a maybe a dress that would come
[47:57] just above the knee and
[47:59] and a shirt that would be tight and and
[48:02] put the paint on their face just to be
[48:04] able
[48:04] to attract a man just enough they
[48:07] learned how to do that
[48:08] and they've learned how to do that today
[48:13] until it's gotten so bad
[48:16] that now it just it's become that people
[48:19] have become bored with just the norm
[48:24] and they actually go into perversion and
[48:25] everything else
[48:28] when did the now but brother branham
[48:30] doesn't leave this in the natural realm
[48:32] he takes us into the spiritual realm he
[48:33] says the increase of the beauty of women
[48:35] is showing the time of deception
[48:38] deception because they really don't look
[48:40] like that
[48:42] i thank god for godly sisters that don't
[48:44] do that
[48:46] but they really don't look like that
[48:48] what has caused the increase of that
[48:50] when
[48:50] and brother brown says when did the
[48:52] church look any prettier than it does
[48:54] today
[48:58] you better keep your eyes open be
[49:01] watching because
[49:02] the gospel is simple it's pretty basic
[49:05] right and god didn't bring you something
[49:07] that would be intellectual and something
[49:09] you'd have to figure out but the gospel
[49:11] is fairly basic
[49:13] even a fool the bible says will not err
[49:15] therein
[49:16] but satan's the beauty of satan's church
[49:20] is so great today that it'll be a very
[49:23] deceptive age
[49:26] that you don't know what that church
[49:28] looks like without makeup
[49:32] are you with me now you don't know what
[49:34] it looks like without all the
[49:36] the denominational trappings you don't
[49:38] know what it looks like what does it
[49:40] produce
[49:43] now look it could be a great church
[49:45] beautiful but it's just like a woman if
[49:46] you marry a young lady
[49:48] she may be beautiful but what what kind
[49:51] of offspring is she going to produce
[49:53] if she's wild she'll produce wild
[49:55] offspring
[49:56] what does the the results look like what
[49:59] do the children look like
[50:00] of this of this deception the children
[50:03] it's not pentecostal children
[50:06] it's not children that that that have
[50:08] the power of god and believe in the
[50:09] miracles of god and trust in god
[50:11] but it's children of the world who live
[50:13] any way they want to
[50:15] and and continue to increase in numbers
[50:17] but doing whatever that they want to do
[50:19] and saying god blesses me anyway
[50:25] i've got to preach these things i've got
[50:26] to go through this you just hang with me
[50:30] what causes the increase of the beauty
[50:32] of the modern church
[50:33] artificial enhancement you realize you
[50:36] can take the word of god and dress it up
[50:38] and make it more beautiful and make an
[50:40] error out of it make something false out
[50:43] of it
[50:45] that actually makes more sense
[50:52] oh you say well it makes more sense
[50:55] if we say that they went across on a sea
[50:57] of reeds
[50:59] across the red sea but it'd be kind of
[51:02] hard for the
[51:03] for the soldiers to drown
[51:07] john all the chairs but it makes more
[51:08] sense it does
[51:10] it makes more sense to say that jesus
[51:12] didn't really raise from the dead
[51:15] it makes more sense to say that signs
[51:17] and miracles and wonders
[51:19] ceased with the apostles it makes more
[51:22] sense
[51:24] sure it does because you're talking
[51:26] about supernatural things
[51:28] and supernatural things never make sense
[51:30] to the carnal mind
[51:32] you're telling me that god came down
[51:34] wrapped himself down
[51:36] in flesh and walked him among the men of
[51:38] the earth for
[51:39] for three and a half years and then was
[51:42] killed on a roman cross
[51:43] and nobody accepted him nobody
[51:45] recognized him
[51:46] that god would allow himself to be spit
[51:48] on and humiliated
[51:50] and and stripes put on his back you're
[51:53] telling me that god would allow
[51:54] that to happen to his own son he would
[51:56] allow that to happen to that flesh that
[51:58] was
[51:59] god it wrapped in flesh yes
[52:02] not because it makes sense but because
[52:05] god interpreted his word by bringing it
[52:07] to pass
[52:09] god did it right
[52:12] but be careful of systems of the world
[52:16] that
[52:16] deceive you by appearing to make more
[52:19] sense
[52:25] even the message doctrines well we'll
[52:26] spiritualize everything it makes more
[52:30] sense
[52:34] what else should we expect we should
[52:36] expect immorality to increase
[52:38] genesis 6 2 again says they took them
[52:41] wives of all which they chose
[52:44] wives of all which they chose and the
[52:46] original that wives is
[52:48] is women they took women
[52:52] and the flashing red light brother
[52:53] branham says did you notice it never
[52:54] said nothing about marriage
[52:56] he said the sons of god came into the
[52:57] daughters of men nothing about marriage
[52:59] if you're taking the original
[53:00] greek the word meaning it says he said
[53:02] i've got it wrote down here somewhere a
[53:03] wife
[53:04] taken unto them women not wives and i'm
[53:08] you can go back and get these quotes i'm
[53:09] kind of rushing through this and
[53:11] picking and choosing because there's
[53:12] somewhere i want to go this morning
[53:15] but he said they took them as they were
[53:16] free lovers like we have today
[53:19] in other words there were they were
[53:20] lovers in that day just as they are now
[53:22] they went any way they wanted to and
[53:24] took any woman that they could
[53:30] and god said
[53:33] my spirit will not always strive with
[53:35] man
[53:38] for that he also is flesh
[53:41] genesis 6 4 6 3 rather
[53:45] also his flesh yet his days shall be 120
[53:49] years
[53:49] verse 4 we should also expect and we've
[53:52] seen immorality increase have we not
[53:57] expect scandal to become common among
[53:59] great men especially political leaders
[54:01] look at genesis 6
[54:02] 4 there were giants in the earth in
[54:04] those days
[54:06] also after that when the sons of god
[54:08] came in unto the daughters of men
[54:10] and bear children to them the same
[54:12] became mighty men which were of old
[54:14] men of renown renowned men everybody
[54:18] would know
[54:18] famous men the bible said he said
[54:23] these those men who taken to them women
[54:25] for wives were men of old renowned
[54:27] renowned men
[54:29] predicted to come again he said like it
[54:31] was in the days of noah
[54:33] so will it be in the coming of the son
[54:35] of man
[54:37] now men taking women not wise women
[54:39] going after strange flesh he said look
[54:41] in england
[54:41] a couple weeks ago look in the united
[54:43] states look everywhere it's full of
[54:44] prostitution
[54:45] great men great high offices bringing
[54:48] disgrace
[54:48] upon the nation running after women and
[54:51] brother branham it wasn't even known
[54:53] back there what john kennedy was up to
[54:56] but history bears it out and look ever
[54:59] since then kennedy
[55:00] clinton trump and now biden and harrison
[55:04] now it's gotten worse not even an issue
[55:05] in the campaign anymore
[55:08] if a person is going to run it's not
[55:09] even an issue
[55:11] whether there was scandal or not because
[55:13] we just expect it
[55:15] it's a sign of the end time
[55:21] genesis 6 5 and god saw that the
[55:23] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[55:25] and that every imagination listen to
[55:28] this
[55:30] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[55:32] heart
[55:33] people say follow your heart you better
[55:34] not
[55:37] do what you think is right do do what
[55:39] your mind tells you to
[55:40] you better not because every imagination
[55:44] of the thoughts of his heart
[55:46] was only evil continually
[55:50] continually it was evil why why was it
[55:55] oh god because
[55:58] the heart was falling away from god that
[56:01] the seed had been mixed
[56:04] and their heart fell before god
[56:08] oh god if you just realize today that
[56:10] our heart
[56:12] i don't care how long you've been in a
[56:13] message church how long you set on these
[56:15] views or
[56:16] maybe not these chairs for very long but
[56:18] you sat here for a while
[56:20] you've been in a message church it
[56:21] doesn't matter you may be
[56:23] you may have listened to every good
[56:25] preacher that ever goes down the pike
[56:27] you may do all kinds of things but your
[56:29] heart can be deceitful
[56:31] your heart can be wicked the imagination
[56:33] of the thoughts of his heart a man's
[56:34] heart that's the condition of man
[56:37] until he's renovated born again there's
[56:40] got to come a fire from god
[56:44] i hope you're hearing me today whether
[56:47] it's me or you or anybody else there's
[56:49] got to come a renovation
[56:51] you're not going to have a new you're
[56:53] not going to have a
[56:54] people that have been living in sin and
[56:57] everything just
[56:58] brought into a heaven that's pure
[57:00] brought into a new heavens and a new
[57:01] earth that's pure
[57:02] but as the earth is renovated by fire
[57:05] the people of god have to be renovated
[57:07] by fire
[57:08] we've got to be renovated by fire it
[57:10] takes the fire of god to burn out all
[57:12] out of you
[57:18] nothing else will work well i think we
[57:21] ought to have the fire of god don't you
[57:23] that's more than emotion that's the
[57:26] burning
[57:27] of the holy spirit burning through your
[57:29] conscience and your thinking and your
[57:31] your motives and your ambitions and
[57:33] everything else until you've given away
[57:35] given up everything the lord if you want
[57:37] me to never do that again i'll never do
[57:39] that again
[57:40] whatever it is you get you're willing to
[57:41] give up everything to have him
[57:44] he burns it all up
[57:51] now look
[57:54] what else was going on during that day
[57:57] something else was going on in the days
[58:00] of noah
[58:02] look at hebrews 11 5
[58:06] it says by faith enoch was translated
[58:10] wait a minute that he should not see
[58:13] death
[58:14] and was not found now the days of noah
[58:16] was that time
[58:17] before the anadoluvian destruction
[58:20] something was going on during those days
[58:23] and it says he was translated that he
[58:24] should not see death and was not found
[58:26] because god had translated him for
[58:30] before his translation he had this
[58:33] testimony
[58:35] he pleased god
[58:39] during this time when every imagination
[58:42] of the thoughts of man's heart was only
[58:44] evil continually
[58:45] here was a man
[58:49] amen who walked with god during this
[58:52] time
[58:54] and please god now remember he was he
[58:55] could only do that because he was the
[58:57] seed
[58:57] of adam
[59:02] you know that he could only do that but
[59:03] the seed of adam every one of us
[59:06] god every one of us have gotten mixed up
[59:12] every one of us see we've got to be born
[59:14] again to please god
[59:16] we've got to be there's got to be a pure
[59:18] seed to be able to do that
[59:19] because no one else can do it but even
[59:23] enoch didn't always walk with god
[59:27] because the bible tells us that for the
[59:30] first 65 years
[59:32] that enoch lived doesn't say nothing
[59:33] about walking with god but when his son
[59:35] methuselah was born
[59:36] he began to walk with god you can begin
[59:40] to walk with god
[59:42] just because you haven't done it doesn't
[59:43] mean you can't do it now
[59:45] you can walk with god i can walk with
[59:47] god from today we can walk with god
[59:50] we can please god you say well i just
[59:52] can't live to please god yes you can
[59:54] you can do that you have the ability to
[59:57] please god you have to why because
[59:58] there's a new there's a seed on the
[1:00:00] inside
[1:00:01] there's something there that's not of
[1:00:02] corruptible seed you've been born again
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] and the seed of god that was always
[1:00:07] there has been renewed and made new
[1:00:10] and it's and it's awakened and it begins
[1:00:12] to have control and authority over your
[1:00:15] life
[1:00:16] the inner man takes precedence over the
[1:00:18] outer men we can please god as a church
[1:00:21] no we'll never be perfect
[1:00:22] yes we'll always make mistakes in the
[1:00:24] flesh but we can please god
[1:00:26] we can walk with god in the days of noah
[1:00:29] at the
[1:00:30] end time when everybody's expecting
[1:00:32] these things to come on the earth and
[1:00:33] they do
[1:00:34] expect to see somebody who pleases god
[1:00:37] in a moment of of terrible sin and
[1:00:40] debauchery of the world expect
[1:00:42] somebody why don't you expect it to be
[1:00:45] you today
[1:00:47] we expect to fail we expect to do wrong
[1:00:49] we expect
[1:00:50] to do that why don't we expect to please
[1:00:52] god why don't we expect to have a family
[1:00:54] that'll love god with all of their heart
[1:00:56] why don't we expect to have a church
[1:00:58] that could be on fire for god
[1:01:00] why don't we expect to have a people to
[1:01:02] be a people that would be
[1:01:03] the manifestation of god to the world
[1:01:06] that we live in
[1:01:06] why don't we expect something like that
[1:01:10] hey man you're looking for something to
[1:01:12] happen over here something to happen
[1:01:13] over here but expect to see a people
[1:01:16] who are walking with god at the end time
[1:01:19] hallelujah i want to be one of those
[1:01:21] don't you expect to see a bride who will
[1:01:24] be the same
[1:01:25] as that first church was expect to see a
[1:01:27] people who had been restored back to the
[1:01:30] faith of the original pentecostal
[1:01:31] fathers
[1:01:33] hallelujah amen
[1:01:39] again it doesn't mean that you haven't
[1:01:40] ever made a mistake people make mistakes
[1:01:43] but expect
[1:01:47] to see somebody who walks with god
[1:01:50] let's look at matthew 24 again matthew
[1:01:53] 24 40
[1:01:55] then shall two be in the field one
[1:01:58] should be taken
[1:02:00] and the other left
[1:02:05] listen two women should be grinding at
[1:02:07] the mill
[1:02:09] one should be taken on the other left he
[1:02:12] said watch therefore
[1:02:14] for you know not what hour your lord
[1:02:18] doth come two women two men and two
[1:02:20] women
[1:02:22] both continuing their daily activities
[1:02:25] of farm life now notice
[1:02:29] jesus portrays these people as being at
[1:02:32] work not at church
[1:02:36] right because he's emphasizing you know
[1:02:38] not
[1:02:41] right so he's emphasizing bringing home
[1:02:43] the point that you're not just a
[1:02:45] christian
[1:02:46] at church or on sundays
[1:02:51] but every day of your life
[1:02:54] you can't live you can't please god
[1:02:56] anymore
[1:02:58] then you live peaceably with your family
[1:03:00] you can't do it
[1:03:02] you can't you can't worship god any
[1:03:05] stronger
[1:03:06] than you live at home and that doesn't
[1:03:10] mean you have to be bound by your
[1:03:11] mistakes all the time everybody makes
[1:03:13] mistakes
[1:03:13] but you repent of those things and you
[1:03:16] move forward walk
[1:03:18] forward you don't have to look back at
[1:03:19] all you can walk forward christians have
[1:03:21] the ability to do that
[1:03:23] but you you don't have to live you can't
[1:03:26] live you can't jump any higher than you
[1:03:27] live right
[1:03:29] now look he says they're both continuing
[1:03:32] their daily activities
[1:03:34] that we could put it like this because
[1:03:36] that was an agricultural age today we
[1:03:38] have different occupations
[1:03:40] but the same idea you could say brother
[1:03:43] allen you say two will be at the bank
[1:03:46] huh one morning you have an appointment
[1:03:48] it says
[1:03:49] eight o'clock somebody walks in there
[1:03:52] and sits down
[1:03:53] brother allen gets up to go get the
[1:03:55] copies because for some reason they
[1:03:56] never put the
[1:03:57] copy machine in the office in a bank i
[1:04:00] don't know why
[1:04:01] but he'll go get i don't know if his
[1:04:03] copy machine's in his office or not he
[1:04:04] may have one but
[1:04:06] they go to get the copies get up walk
[1:04:08] down the aisle to get the copies
[1:04:09] and he never comes back
[1:04:13] guy sits there and says well this is the
[1:04:15] worst service
[1:04:17] i've been a customer of this bank for 40
[1:04:19] years
[1:04:21] two will be at the bank one taken
[1:04:24] another left
[1:04:29] see well i don't fit with my theology
[1:04:31] well it did with the lord's
[1:04:36] think about it two will be painting a
[1:04:39] house
[1:04:43] two will be working on the construction
[1:04:45] site
[1:04:48] and the one yells over hey i need that
[1:04:51] bucket of paint bring up that bucket of
[1:04:54] paint no answer
[1:04:56] the guy quit where'd he go
[1:05:01] he's gone
[1:05:05] two women sitting talking
[1:05:08] maybe i shouldn't just have them sitting
[1:05:10] and talking but
[1:05:14] two women doing whatever it is that they
[1:05:16] do maybe at work
[1:05:18] maybe at home and they're taking care of
[1:05:21] their children
[1:05:23] gone one taken
[1:05:26] another left look
[1:05:32] he says in luke 17 34 he says it again
[1:05:37] he said i tell you and that night there
[1:05:38] shall be two men in one bed the one
[1:05:39] should be taken the other should be left
[1:05:42] two women should be grinding together
[1:05:43] the one should be taken and the other
[1:05:45] left
[1:05:45] you say well this this and this has to
[1:05:47] happen we'll get into that but
[1:05:48] this this has to happen well how would
[1:05:51] that be secret because
[1:05:52] listen if anybody sees me turn back into
[1:05:54] a
[1:05:55] perfect body they're gonna know it
[1:06:00] think about it
[1:06:06] it's a sudden secret going away of the
[1:06:08] church and they won't even know what
[1:06:09] happened
[1:06:13] maybe a few will guess at it because
[1:06:16] they were exposed to the message
[1:06:18] and they said under message preaching
[1:06:24] luke 17 34 he said i tell you that night
[1:06:26] there should be two men in
[1:06:28] one bed one should be taken to other
[1:06:30] left two women should be grinding
[1:06:31] together
[1:06:32] the one should be taken the other left
[1:06:33] two men shall be in the field
[1:06:35] the one should be taken and the other
[1:06:36] left
[1:06:38] and they answered and said unto him
[1:06:40] where lord where are they going
[1:06:43] amen i love this he said wheresoever the
[1:06:46] body is
[1:06:48] neither will the eagles be gathered
[1:06:50] together see we're gathered to him now
[1:06:52] and this is going on right now in a
[1:06:54] spiritual sense
[1:06:56] you understand it's going on one's taken
[1:06:59] and the other's left
[1:07:01] but yet there's a there's a physical
[1:07:03] manifestation of that too because
[1:07:05] there's coming a time when there'll be
[1:07:06] people missing
[1:07:08] but right now one's taken and the
[1:07:09] other's left one
[1:07:11] has a desire a burning desire to please
[1:07:13] god
[1:07:14] and another one sits right beside him on
[1:07:16] the church view and has no desire
[1:07:22] one may look you say well it's the ones
[1:07:24] that live the best
[1:07:25] i beg to differ think about it who was
[1:07:28] the seed jacob or esau
[1:07:33] be the one that does everything right
[1:07:34] keeps all his bills spayed
[1:07:36] and is the perfect christian in hardy
[1:07:39] arkansas
[1:07:40] the perfect hearty definition of what a
[1:07:43] christian would be that's the one that's
[1:07:44] going to go don't don't think like that
[1:07:47] because that might just be somebody
[1:07:49] covering up you don't know what somebody
[1:07:51] is on the inside
[1:07:52] but you got to be ready yourself and so
[1:07:56] wherever the body is neither will the
[1:07:58] eagles be gathered together wherever the
[1:08:00] word
[1:08:00] is brother said that's that body was
[1:08:04] the carcass was the word of the hour the
[1:08:06] fresh kill of the hour
[1:08:08] the word of the hour not the word of
[1:08:09] another day but those that are gathered
[1:08:12] around
[1:08:12] amen what's it going to be now lots of
[1:08:15] people
[1:08:17] i'm going to go into some dangerous
[1:08:18] territory here but you just stay with me
[1:08:21] lots of people love shouting and emotion
[1:08:23] and and sensation and i do too
[1:08:26] but a lot of people like that a lot of
[1:08:29] people gather around that but that's not
[1:08:31] what he said they'd be gathered around
[1:08:33] but they'd be gathered by the word
[1:08:37] watch and see what what value people
[1:08:40] place on the word
[1:08:41] are they willing to do whatever it takes
[1:08:43] to get the word
[1:08:45] are they willing to do whatever it takes
[1:08:47] to have their families
[1:08:48] under the word to have their how have
[1:08:50] their there being a church that preaches
[1:08:52] and teaches the word
[1:08:53] watch people's reaction to the word and
[1:08:56] all of that is a part of the word the
[1:08:58] word said what happened
[1:08:59] the word said we'd shout and speak in
[1:09:01] tongues and
[1:09:02] and all these things the gifts of the
[1:09:03] spirit but watch your attitude towards
[1:09:06] the word that's what makes the
[1:09:07] difference
[1:09:11] wherever the body is neither will the
[1:09:13] eagles be gathered together now
[1:09:15] where the word is they will be gathered
[1:09:17] to that word of the hour
[1:09:20] and we know that that word is christ
[1:09:24] now again it won't be and we'll get into
[1:09:26] this a little more it won't be a
[1:09:27] particular place in the earth
[1:09:29] whenever a man tells you that he has the
[1:09:31] word and nobody else does
[1:09:32] run
[1:09:38] because we've already had the word given
[1:09:40] for the hour
[1:09:43] the word has come for the hour i've got
[1:09:44] truth that you need to make it run
[1:09:47] because jesus said there'll be many
[1:09:50] false christs
[1:09:51] false anointed ones there'll be many
[1:09:53] that'll say here here and here
[1:09:55] this is where you should go here in the
[1:09:57] desert here here over here
[1:09:59] he said no he said don't believe any of
[1:10:00] them
[1:10:04] the word has to be vindicated the word
[1:10:06] of the hour now look
[1:10:07] what brother branham says about these
[1:10:09] things in abraham and his seat after him
[1:10:11] in 1961
[1:10:13] he said but the next thing for the
[1:10:14] church is to be changed
[1:10:16] if you go back and get the whole quote
[1:10:18] he's talking about how there was
[1:10:20] martin luther and john wesley and the
[1:10:22] church went through the process of
[1:10:23] justification sanctification
[1:10:25] the baptism of the holy ghost and seeing
[1:10:26] the manifestation of the promised son
[1:10:29] the sign of the son of man he said but
[1:10:31] the next thing for the church is to be
[1:10:33] changed
[1:10:34] he said we've had every sign
[1:10:36] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:10:38] the holy spirit placing of a son
[1:10:40] manifestation of the spirit now what he
[1:10:42] said the changing of the body for the
[1:10:44] rapture
[1:10:47] he said oh my how the church ought to be
[1:10:50] waving its hands in glory
[1:10:52] thanking god amen thanking god any
[1:10:56] minute
[1:10:56] the change could come
[1:11:00] now watch what he says for the bible
[1:11:01] said it'd be universal
[1:11:08] i don't get changed and then come up
[1:11:09] here on sunday morning and say see i got
[1:11:11] a new body now y'all if you all listen
[1:11:13] to me this morning you can have yours
[1:11:15] that's not how it works
[1:11:22] look there'd be no warning not now we've
[1:11:25] already had a warning
[1:11:29] the midnight cries already been made
[1:11:32] the shout has already went out
[1:11:40] now look he said to be universal jesus
[1:11:43] said there'll be two in the middle
[1:11:44] grinding i'll take one and leave one two
[1:11:45] in the field
[1:11:46] i'll take one and leave one two in the
[1:11:48] bed he said should it be on both sides
[1:11:50] of the earth
[1:11:54] now listen both sides of the earth
[1:11:57] well it's night on one side be day on
[1:11:59] the other i'll take one and leave one
[1:12:02] he said the rapture will be universal
[1:12:05] and their bodies will be changed
[1:12:08] our bodies he said will have to be
[1:12:10] changed
[1:12:11] we just can't turn back to young men and
[1:12:13] women we've got to have a different kind
[1:12:16] of body
[1:12:17] he said so you can be caught in the air
[1:12:19] to receive the promised son
[1:12:21] he said that's what the church is
[1:12:22] waiting for now
[1:12:26] so we don't get distracted by every
[1:12:27] little thing that runs off and and
[1:12:29] starts its own
[1:12:30] place in the desert right
[1:12:33] but but you got it what the true church
[1:12:35] is watching for is the change of the
[1:12:37] body he said well that's what they said
[1:12:38] 20 years ago
[1:12:39] it's as true today as it ever was and
[1:12:42] watch
[1:12:42] matthew 24 and 25 as jesus brings to
[1:12:45] come through these things
[1:12:46] what happens the the husbandmen the men
[1:12:49] begin to say that my lord delayeth is
[1:12:51] coming
[1:12:52] the virgins the foolish virgins and the
[1:12:54] wise virgins both falsely
[1:12:56] all these things that happen why because
[1:12:57] there's a delay
[1:12:59] there's a delay built in but we're
[1:13:02] we're not looking at the delay we're not
[1:13:04] looking at that time can be the enemy of
[1:13:06] faith many times you say well it's been
[1:13:07] years and years and years
[1:13:08] but i'm looking at the promise what's
[1:13:10] the next promise like abraham was
[1:13:12] he wasn't looking for something else he
[1:13:13] said there's going to be a son
[1:13:15] and he believed it for 25 years until it
[1:13:18] come to pass we've been believing it for
[1:13:20] longer than that but it's coming to pass
[1:13:23] it's got to now look
[1:13:28] you see and i know where message people
[1:13:30] were educated what about six and nine
[1:13:34] now think about this because brother
[1:13:36] brown says this in the rapture he said
[1:13:39] the night was not divided in hours and
[1:13:41] bible time was divided into watches
[1:13:42] there were three watches
[1:13:44] and the first watch started from 9 to
[1:13:46] 12.
[1:13:47] the second watch started from 12 to 3
[1:13:50] and the third watch of the night was
[1:13:51] counted from three to six
[1:13:53] so now you're in the morning morning
[1:13:56] time right
[1:13:57] he said now we got three threes which is
[1:13:59] nine imperfect number
[1:14:00] he said then we come back to seven for
[1:14:02] the rapture he said which will take
[1:14:04] place i believe between
[1:14:06] six and seven o'clock he said or six and
[1:14:08] nine o'clock
[1:14:09] some morning for the trumpet of the lord
[1:14:12] shall sound and brother branham quotes a
[1:14:13] hymn
[1:14:14] when the role is called up yonder so on
[1:14:17] that bright and cloudless morning
[1:14:20] right it'd be morning now look but
[1:14:23] morning where
[1:14:25] i think it's important for us not to get
[1:14:27] too hung up that we got to balance
[1:14:29] our doctrine what we teach we make a
[1:14:32] dogma out of something brother branham
[1:14:33] said and we not balanced it with
[1:14:35] everything that he said
[1:14:36] many times and and look here because
[1:14:40] brother brown said and god keeps his
[1:14:41] word in 1957 he said two will be in the
[1:14:43] bed
[1:14:43] he said it must be night time somewhere
[1:14:45] when he comes
[1:14:47] now for me i want it to be between six
[1:14:49] and nine i'm expecting him some morning
[1:14:53] brother brown said that's what he
[1:14:54] believed between 6 and 9.
[1:14:56] come now but think about this
[1:14:58] jeffersonville time
[1:15:01] or is it jerusalem time
[1:15:04] i think about that jerusalem time be
[1:15:06] about 10 o'clock
[1:15:07] at night and i don't know about some of
[1:15:11] you but i'd be in bed most nights
[1:15:15] right we have no you understand we have
[1:15:17] no option on that like we don't get to
[1:15:18] tell god well you it's going to happen
[1:15:20] after i wake up
[1:15:24] right are you with me now but some
[1:15:26] morning we could say that
[1:15:30] some morning it'd be six and nine
[1:15:31] between six and nine somewhere
[1:15:34] maybe that'll be jeffersonville time i
[1:15:36] kind of think that maybe god showed
[1:15:37] brother branham that it'd be that time
[1:15:39] but it'd be that's five and ten here
[1:15:42] or five and eight my math doesn't work
[1:15:44] very good
[1:15:48] so you know if you if you're too
[1:15:49] dogmatic on something like that you miss
[1:15:51] what brother branham was trying to say
[1:15:53] some morning we're going to be changed
[1:15:56] now look at this
[1:15:59] he said two will be in the bed must be
[1:16:00] nighttime somewhere now look at the
[1:16:01] order of the rapture brother branham
[1:16:03] gives the ten virgins he says
[1:16:05] there will be some of you sitting at a
[1:16:06] table one of these mornings
[1:16:08] sitting at a table one will be taken
[1:16:12] the other left
[1:16:16] said brother ben are you sure about that
[1:16:18] i'm absolutely
[1:16:20] sure about it what it means is you don't
[1:16:23] go as a family
[1:16:25] you don't go as a group you don't go as
[1:16:28] a church you go as an individual
[1:16:31] he said you'll finally wonder what's the
[1:16:33] matter
[1:16:35] one will be taken the other left what's
[1:16:37] the matter he said be riding right along
[1:16:39] in a car
[1:16:40] talking to somebody wife or hubby
[1:16:43] now think about the how traumatic this
[1:16:46] would be
[1:16:49] wife or hubby oh my sitting at the seat
[1:16:56] they won't answer they won't be there
[1:17:01] run to the graveyard he said there'll be
[1:17:03] some graves open the other one's still
[1:17:05] closed you say explain that brother ben
[1:17:06] i can't explain that i don't know but he
[1:17:09] said it
[1:17:11] he said for the rest of the dead live
[1:17:12] not for the space of a thousand years he
[1:17:14] said just remember it's over then
[1:17:19] it'll be a secret coming no one will
[1:17:20] know when it's going to happen
[1:17:22] he said we're commanded to be ready and
[1:17:24] watching we don't know what hour
[1:17:28] but whatever it is amen
[1:17:31] will not prevent any of these back in
[1:17:33] here for just as soon as jesus appears
[1:17:37] the whole watch rises dead or alive
[1:17:41] doesn't matter bad see god's got a
[1:17:44] wanted poster
[1:17:47] he wants you dead or alive
[1:17:53] some will be dead some will be alive but
[1:17:55] it won't matter
[1:17:57] it's a universal rapture he said we
[1:17:59] don't meet him first
[1:18:01] we meet one another first amen
[1:18:05] the bible said ephesians the fifth
[1:18:06] chapter it said for we which are alive
[1:18:08] and remain
[1:18:08] unto the coming of the lord down here
[1:18:10] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[1:18:12] are asleep
[1:18:14] and he goes on and i've just taken part
[1:18:16] of this but you can go look at the whole
[1:18:17] thing
[1:18:18] he said them precious ones that sealed
[1:18:20] their blood sealed their testimony with
[1:18:22] their blood
[1:18:22] not prevent or hinder those that are
[1:18:24] asleep for the trumpet will sound
[1:18:26] something will take place the gospel
[1:18:28] something will sound the announcing of
[1:18:30] his coming
[1:18:31] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:18:34] and we which are alive and remain shall
[1:18:36] be changed
[1:18:38] he said standing and feel a change
[1:18:41] coming on
[1:18:42] the gray hair go out the wrinkles fall
[1:18:44] away be changed in a moment in a
[1:18:46] twinkling of an eye
[1:18:48] and we shall meet our loved ones first
[1:18:51] there's mama
[1:18:52] papa there's my buddy oh hallelujah
[1:18:54] we're ready
[1:18:57] amen and then together with them that
[1:18:59] we're dead sets of scripture
[1:19:01] we'll be caught up in the air to meet
[1:19:02] the lord the order of the coming
[1:19:05] amen now
[1:19:11] he said oh to see that old daddy of mine
[1:19:13] oh my see them old loved ones just went
[1:19:15] down in faith yonder
[1:19:17] to meet them see the sweetness of god
[1:19:19] knowing if we met him first we'd wonder
[1:19:21] was mama in it didn't mama finally make
[1:19:24] it
[1:19:24] we've preached so hard we've tried
[1:19:26] what's she here his uncle joe here
[1:19:29] is the brother here is so-and-so see
[1:19:31] lord we love you we love you but
[1:19:32] first we're going to meet one another oh
[1:19:34] no wondering about it
[1:19:37] we're all there now look
[1:19:42] first corinthians 15 51 look how paul
[1:19:44] puts it behold i show you a mystery we
[1:19:46] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:19:48] changed
[1:19:49] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:19:50] at the last trump and the trumpet shall
[1:19:52] sound the dead shall be raised
[1:19:53] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:19:55] you say well i'll notice i'll notice my
[1:19:57] wife she's a good christian and she'll
[1:19:58] be real
[1:19:59] real really a christian right close to
[1:20:01] the rapture you're not going to know
[1:20:05] well i'll notice my church will be on
[1:20:07] fire i'll get ready i'm
[1:20:09] i'm a young person waiting you know i
[1:20:11] haven't been baptized or maybe
[1:20:13] maybe an older person than that's hiding
[1:20:15] something that they should
[1:20:16] should just let go of holding on to some
[1:20:18] grudge or something like that
[1:20:19] i'll just hold on to it because i'll
[1:20:20] know when the time comes for the rapture
[1:20:22] i'll see some things
[1:20:23] i'll see brother brown and i'll see this
[1:20:25] and that and the other you won't know
[1:20:32] it'll happen so quick it'll all go past
[1:20:34] you you won't know
[1:20:37] it'll just be gone
[1:20:40] brother branham keeps getting this
[1:20:41] question and questions and answers they
[1:20:43] keep asking him
[1:20:44] about the bride will they be in one
[1:20:45] place and these are leading questions
[1:20:47] many times
[1:20:48] because there was a doctrine then that
[1:20:50] that you had to go west
[1:20:51] to be in the message and we've heard a
[1:20:54] different version of that on some level
[1:20:56] over and over and over again through the
[1:20:57] years you have to go
[1:21:00] here to be in the message and what's
[1:21:01] funny about it is it was the desert
[1:21:03] and brother branham answers it by saying
[1:21:05] no jesus said don't go to the desert
[1:21:10] don't go to the desert even though
[1:21:13] that's where brother branham
[1:21:14] was but he said is he in the desert no
[1:21:17] and and so they keep asking this
[1:21:19] question will the bride be gathered
[1:21:20] together in one place at the rapture and
[1:21:22] will it be in the west
[1:21:24] i said brother branham come on and say
[1:21:25] it we know you believe it just
[1:21:29] because people just assumed that the
[1:21:30] prophet believed what they believed
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:32] sometimes we do the same thing
[1:21:37] he said no he said nope it don't have to
[1:21:40] be there
[1:21:41] yeah the bride will be gathered together
[1:21:43] in one place that is true but not until
[1:21:45] the resurrection
[1:21:47] he said see we which are alive and
[1:21:49] remain unto the coming of the lord
[1:21:51] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[1:21:53] are asleep
[1:21:54] universally for the trumpet of god shall
[1:21:57] sound
[1:21:58] and the dead in christ shall rise and we
[1:22:00] shall be caught up together
[1:22:01] with them to meet the lord in the air
[1:22:04] therefore he said the bride will all be
[1:22:06] together when it goes to meet the lord
[1:22:09] see it we'll be together but it don't
[1:22:10] necessarily mean they'll have to be
[1:22:12] sitting in one place like this
[1:22:13] because the bride is sleeping in the
[1:22:15] dust of the earth around the world
[1:22:17] from the arctic to the tropics from the
[1:22:18] east to the west from the north to the
[1:22:20] south
[1:22:21] so jesus said when the son of man shall
[1:22:23] appear why it said it'd be like light
[1:22:25] that shines from the east
[1:22:26] even into the west he said the whole
[1:22:28] thing there will be a resurrection a
[1:22:30] rapture
[1:22:31] and a way it'll go
[1:22:35] and before it ever he said go up to meet
[1:22:38] him now
[1:22:39] the first thing happens when we're
[1:22:40] resurrected he said the ones which are
[1:22:43] living will just still remain
[1:22:45] the resurrection will set in first the
[1:22:46] resurrection of those that are asleep
[1:22:48] there will be awakening time
[1:22:50] those which are asleep in the dust now
[1:22:52] not those that are asleep in sin because
[1:22:53] they sleep right on
[1:22:54] they don't awake for another thousand
[1:22:56] years
[1:22:57] but those who are sleeping in the dust
[1:22:59] will be awakened first
[1:23:02] and these corruptible bodies will put on
[1:23:04] incorruption in the rapture and grace of
[1:23:05] the lord
[1:23:07] then we'll all get together oh what a
[1:23:10] meeting
[1:23:12] and we're not going to hold off in our
[1:23:13] own little church and our own little
[1:23:15] doctrine and stay off on our side and
[1:23:17] we'll all get together
[1:23:21] we'll all get together because god's
[1:23:23] people love to be together
[1:23:26] show me one place in scripture where
[1:23:27] god's people ever ever
[1:23:29] chose to stay alone
[1:23:33] unless it was a prophet of god it was
[1:23:34] standing out into the desert you
[1:23:36] understand but god's people
[1:23:37] always wanted to be together
[1:23:41] he said and then when they begin to get
[1:23:43] together then we which are alive and
[1:23:44] remain
[1:23:45] shall be changed amen
[1:23:48] he said these mortal bodies will not see
[1:23:51] death but just
[1:23:52] of a sudden there'll be like a sweep go
[1:23:54] over us and you're changed
[1:23:56] you're turned back like abraham was from
[1:23:58] an old man to a young man from an old
[1:24:00] woman to a young woman
[1:24:02] what's this sudden change after a while
[1:24:04] you're traveling like a thought
[1:24:06] amen you can see those then who are
[1:24:09] already resurrected
[1:24:11] oh what an hour i'm looking forward to
[1:24:14] seeing some
[1:24:16] i'm looking forward to seeing them look
[1:24:18] if you want to go see if you've got
[1:24:20] somebody overseas if you've got a loved
[1:24:22] one or you've got people i've got people
[1:24:23] that i've met that
[1:24:24] i just fell in love with while i was
[1:24:26] overseas people they're wonderful
[1:24:27] godly christian people and i'd love to
[1:24:30] be back overseas i'd love to go see them
[1:24:32] i may never get to go see them but i
[1:24:34] know this it's a 16-hour plane ride
[1:24:36] and then another four-hour plane ride to
[1:24:38] get where they're at but one of these
[1:24:39] days
[1:24:40] all i have to do is think about them
[1:24:46] i'd like to see brother malevo or i'd
[1:24:50] like to see
[1:24:51] i'd like to see brother pastor benin be
[1:24:54] right there
[1:24:58] church you realize how big that is how
[1:25:01] much it is the
[1:25:02] the desire to gather together how much a
[1:25:04] part of a christian that is
[1:25:07] the desire to be together not to be
[1:25:09] alone because we're going to be together
[1:25:11] there's not going to be a heaven where
[1:25:13] it's all split up and separate we're
[1:25:14] going to be together
[1:25:17] amen amen we're gathered together
[1:25:21] he says then he said oh what an hour he
[1:25:24] says then we'll gather with them and
[1:25:25] then be caught up with them to meet the
[1:25:27] lord in the air
[1:25:28] he said it's not necessary if your uncle
[1:25:30] is buried down in southern kentucky
[1:25:32] if he has to be brought up in indiana or
[1:25:34] buried in indiana has to be taken to
[1:25:36] southern kentucky
[1:25:37] no matter where he is them that are dead
[1:25:39] in the sea shall rise from the sea
[1:25:42] he goes on and talks about it some he
[1:25:43] said those that were destroyed in that
[1:25:44] arena
[1:25:45] eat up by lions those who are thrown in
[1:25:47] the fiery furnaces not even the bones
[1:25:49] will be left or the dust
[1:25:50] they shall still rise amen
[1:25:54] he says they've died everywhere china
[1:25:56] japan around the world
[1:25:57] the coming of the lord will be universal
[1:26:00] this rapture will
[1:26:02] he said watch the changing there will be
[1:26:05] two in the pen
[1:26:06] i'll take one and leave one the same
[1:26:08] moment
[1:26:11] two in the field i'll take one and leave
[1:26:13] one one on the dark side of the earth
[1:26:14] one on the light side of the earth
[1:26:16] see it'll be a universal rapture yes the
[1:26:18] church will all be together
[1:26:20] but after after the resurrection
[1:26:23] and the rapture said and he said brother
[1:26:25] ben where are you going with this it's
[1:26:26] important church
[1:26:28] it's important because we've got to
[1:26:30] realize that we go as an
[1:26:31] individual to be in a group
[1:26:36] but we don't leave as a group
[1:26:41] don't splash over
[1:26:44] it's not like i'll go in the rapture
[1:26:46] because i'm set born again and then my
[1:26:49] my wife will go because she's next to me
[1:26:53] that's not how it works she has to be
[1:26:56] born again too so do every one of you
[1:27:00] myself preacher included
[1:27:04] we ought to give up everything to get
[1:27:06] that
[1:27:10] everything to get that look
[1:27:15] brother branham answers the same
[1:27:16] question that was questions answers
[1:27:17] number one
[1:27:18] question and answer is number four
[1:27:21] same question they've asked it four or
[1:27:22] five times in between
[1:27:25] and brother branham in one place says
[1:27:27] i'll tell you you want a place you can
[1:27:28] go i'll tell you where it is
[1:27:29] i'm gonna tell you the place that's in
[1:27:31] christ
[1:27:35] the question to answer is number four he
[1:27:36] said they asked him the same basically
[1:27:39] the same question he said it's very
[1:27:40] doubtful whether it'll be that way
[1:27:43] because the bible said there will be two
[1:27:44] in the bed he said
[1:27:46] i'll take one and leave one two in the
[1:27:49] field and i'll take one and leave one
[1:27:52] he said see so they probably across the
[1:27:54] world they won't be gathered in one
[1:27:55] place
[1:27:56] to have things in common now watch as he
[1:27:58] goes through this quote you can go read
[1:28:00] the quote
[1:28:00] he as he answers the question he gets
[1:28:02] more and more certain of what he's
[1:28:04] saying
[1:28:04] and says it more and more definitely he
[1:28:06] starts off he says probably won't be
[1:28:08] that way
[1:28:09] then he continues on watch what he says
[1:28:11] he said they won't be gathered in one
[1:28:12] place to have things in common
[1:28:14] but little groups of them will be
[1:28:17] scattered
[1:28:17] all over the earth now watch
[1:28:22] you've noticed that in the message over
[1:28:24] the years that
[1:28:25] every time there comes a gathering place
[1:28:28] where everybody's got to be and go
[1:28:31] whenever that happens people start to go
[1:28:33] and they say well i need to identify
[1:28:34] with a certain ministry this certain
[1:28:35] place
[1:28:36] in a certain town every time that
[1:28:38] happens something happens to break it up
[1:28:42] think about it preacher gets old and
[1:28:45] passes away
[1:28:47] or or some scandal something happens
[1:28:51] god allows something to take place and
[1:28:52] it breaks it up why
[1:28:54] why why is there not and i've seen even
[1:28:56] overseas and
[1:28:58] and it's worse overseas than it is here
[1:29:00] where a man will
[1:29:01] some man some gifted minister especially
[1:29:02] in africa will take control of a huge
[1:29:04] group of people everybody's got to come
[1:29:06] hear me
[1:29:07] and he's never even met half his
[1:29:09] congregation
[1:29:11] but brother brown didn't say it would be
[1:29:12] that way
[1:29:14] he said there will be little groups of
[1:29:16] them all over the all over the earth
[1:29:18] scattered
[1:29:19] all over the earth and i believe that's
[1:29:22] why they get broke up because god won't
[1:29:24] allow it
[1:29:25] little groups of them will be scattered
[1:29:27] over the earth i don't want to be
[1:29:28] identified with a certain ministry a
[1:29:30] certain
[1:29:30] certain place or a certain time i want
[1:29:32] to be in one of those little groups
[1:29:34] little maybe 500 maybe a thousand maybe
[1:29:37] maybe five
[1:29:38] i don't know what size that little group
[1:29:40] is but i want to be in it
[1:29:43] and then of that group that well not
[1:29:44] everybody goes
[1:29:46] you understand little groups everywhere
[1:29:50] and brother branham says i believe maybe
[1:29:53] if the lord permits that this is a
[1:29:54] little group of it
[1:29:56] he said maybe another little group in
[1:29:58] asia one down in germany one down
[1:30:00] somewhere else
[1:30:02] now watch what he says he said when i
[1:30:03] seen a vision of the bride the other
[1:30:04] night
[1:30:05] they was made up from the international
[1:30:08] remember they were wearing the clothes
[1:30:10] that of their country
[1:30:12] they were wearing or wearing the they
[1:30:13] had different they had different uh
[1:30:15] faces they had different features they
[1:30:17] had all the features and things that
[1:30:18] they would have of their own
[1:30:20] country that they come from they look
[1:30:22] like their own country
[1:30:24] but they were all gathered together now
[1:30:27] look
[1:30:28] that don't happen on this side happens
[1:30:30] on the other side but they come from
[1:30:31] every country he said they were made up
[1:30:32] from the international he said see
[1:30:34] so the bride won't be gathered from one
[1:30:36] place it'll be gathered from all over
[1:30:38] the world
[1:30:39] and it's been being gathered for all
[1:30:42] these years
[1:30:44] what is it being gathered to to christ
[1:30:46] the word but not everybody that comes to
[1:30:49] church is gathered
[1:30:50] to the word now look he said they'd be
[1:30:53] gathered from all over the world
[1:30:54] and that exactly vindicates with the
[1:30:56] word and never has the word
[1:30:58] been wrong he said unto this time
[1:31:01] neither
[1:31:02] has the vision ever been wrong because
[1:31:04] it's been
[1:31:05] according to the word now watch how he
[1:31:08] stressed i know i'm reading a lot this
[1:31:10] morning but i've just got a few more
[1:31:11] minutes then we'll close
[1:31:13] watch how he stresses this individual
[1:31:15] goes in the rapture
[1:31:16] not the church not the group
[1:31:20] he said his in christ the mystery of god
[1:31:22] revealed he fit his presence
[1:31:24] in the individual in the individual with
[1:31:28] a personal vindication
[1:31:30] of himself expressing himself
[1:31:34] the living word that's promised for the
[1:31:36] day
[1:31:37] expressing itself through you a
[1:31:40] vindication of the great
[1:31:42] revelation of god he said well brother
[1:31:45] branham was vindicated but brother
[1:31:46] branham said that we would be vindicated
[1:31:50] not in that way but it's vindicated by
[1:31:52] the life that we live
[1:31:55] right we are vindicated a vindication of
[1:31:58] himself
[1:31:59] he said look only in an individual
[1:32:02] never in a group an individual not in a
[1:32:05] group
[1:32:06] his identification is with an individual
[1:32:10] he said you get that not with the method
[1:32:11] it's not with the baptist not the
[1:32:13] presbyterian
[1:32:14] not the lutheran not the pentecostals
[1:32:15] but as an individual he said but
[1:32:17] if i'm with this certain group in the
[1:32:19] message i'll be okay knowing his
[1:32:21] identification
[1:32:22] is with the individual and i can walk
[1:32:25] with the best of them be around the best
[1:32:27] of them go to all the camp meetings and
[1:32:29] stuff that i enjoy doing i could go to
[1:32:31] all of them and still not make it
[1:32:35] because he said i'll take one and leave
[1:32:37] one i'll separate them that's right
[1:32:38] there'll be two in the field i'll take
[1:32:39] one and leave one there'll be two in the
[1:32:41] bed i'll take one and leave one
[1:32:44] it's not a group it's a it is a personal
[1:32:46] vindication
[1:32:47] listen of impregnated child of god
[1:32:50] filled with the holy ghost
[1:32:52] so surrendered to god that he don't care
[1:32:55] about anything else
[1:32:58] and the holy spirit living its life
[1:33:00] pulsating through him
[1:33:02] showing the personal vindication of the
[1:33:04] word he said brother ben what
[1:33:05] vindication do you want
[1:33:06] what vindication do you want do you want
[1:33:08] a pillar of fire do you want a great
[1:33:10] ministry you want a bunch of people to
[1:33:11] watch
[1:33:12] a bunch of people to stream what
[1:33:13] vindication do you want i want a
[1:33:15] personal vindication of the word
[1:33:20] a personal vindication of the word
[1:33:22] that'll show up where i work to show up
[1:33:23] where i
[1:33:24] live where i eat what i do everything
[1:33:26] about me it'll show who i am
[1:33:29] a personal vindication of the word
[1:33:31] itself it's expressing itself to the
[1:33:33] people into the world amen
[1:33:37] never said well we'll all go where the
[1:33:39] where the prophet is not even when the
[1:33:40] prophet was here
[1:33:44] we'll all go where the preacher is we'll
[1:33:46] all go where some great man is
[1:33:48] never did that
[1:33:54] look at this
[1:33:57] this quote just just struck me and then
[1:34:00] i'll close
[1:34:04] brandon preached a sermon called the
[1:34:05] sudden secret going away of the church
[1:34:08] that title attracted my attention as a
[1:34:10] young man
[1:34:12] the sudden secret going away of the
[1:34:13] church
[1:34:15] he said now you say certain things will
[1:34:18] take place
[1:34:19] and then i'll make ready make
[1:34:23] ready now
[1:34:26] he said well i gotta wait for the
[1:34:28] population to increase really
[1:34:32] it's doubled since brother branham said
[1:34:35] that and been going on for
[1:34:36] a long time
[1:34:39] make ready now oh i gotta wait for the
[1:34:42] world to get wicked really
[1:34:48] i'm waiting on a message to come really
[1:34:54] waiting on a prophet really
[1:34:58] i mean come on
[1:35:03] but i tell you what we'll fight we'll
[1:35:06] fight the everyday things of life
[1:35:07] because that's what jesus told us we'd
[1:35:09] fight
[1:35:11] we'll fight just going to work and
[1:35:12] getting discouraged
[1:35:15] being discouraged at home seeing our
[1:35:18] kids maybe do things
[1:35:19] and just getting discouraged well maybe
[1:35:21] don't matter
[1:35:22] getting caught up in the bills and the
[1:35:25] things that are going on and all the
[1:35:27] amusements that we have
[1:35:29] just getting caught up that's where
[1:35:30] we're going to fight every day we're
[1:35:31] going to fight there
[1:35:33] because we have to be ready make ready
[1:35:36] now
[1:35:37] he said i've just related to you pearl
[1:35:39] harbor in many places where they refuse
[1:35:40] to hear the warning
[1:35:42] they didn't hear it they refused to
[1:35:44] listen to it he said nothing was left
[1:35:46] but divine judgment upon the people
[1:35:48] he said now all that will not go in
[1:35:50] christ listen
[1:35:51] all that will not go in christ
[1:35:54] will be under god's wrath and divine
[1:35:56] judgment
[1:35:59] remember what i preached wednesday night
[1:36:01] he's not a destroyer he didn't come
[1:36:03] the first time to destroy that's not his
[1:36:06] nature
[1:36:07] but he will come in wrath and destroy
[1:36:10] those who destroy the earth
[1:36:15] he will come that's a reality we're
[1:36:17] promised that by the scripture
[1:36:18] regardless of how you think it'll happen
[1:36:20] we're promised that by the scripture
[1:36:22] he will come and wrath the lion the lamb
[1:36:24] becomes the lion
[1:36:26] and becomes judgment and all that will
[1:36:29] not going
[1:36:32] by judgment he said please don't let
[1:36:35] that happen to you
[1:36:40] i may spend the rest of my life for the
[1:36:42] job if it takes the rest of my life if
[1:36:44] it takes everything that i have
[1:36:47] not so much should warn you i want to
[1:36:49] warn you but myself let that ring in my
[1:36:51] ear please don't let that happen to you
[1:36:56] you say well that's you're a preacher
[1:36:58] but paul said lest i
[1:36:59] preach to others and be disapproved of
[1:37:04] myself
[1:37:06] i want to go in that rapture i've got a
[1:37:08] desire to go in the rapture i've heard
[1:37:10] preachers preach it as if well it don't
[1:37:11] really matter if i don't go to rapture
[1:37:12] i'll be a foolish virgin
[1:37:14] i don't want to be here
[1:37:17] i don't want to be here when the
[1:37:18] elements melt with fervent heat i don't
[1:37:20] want to be here i want to be ready
[1:37:23] i want to be wet ready to go listen what
[1:37:26] he says he said no matter what the
[1:37:27] branham tabernacle
[1:37:29] ever turns out to be don't you let it be
[1:37:32] you
[1:37:37] you don't identify as a group no matter
[1:37:40] what the church
[1:37:41] does god forbid that this church would
[1:37:44] ever become worldly
[1:37:45] and allow all kinds of everything to go
[1:37:47] on don't you let that be you
[1:37:52] some of the church would become crazy go
[1:37:54] off on some doctrine somewhere
[1:37:55] don't you let that be you you'll be a
[1:37:57] servant of christ
[1:37:59] no matter what the church world does
[1:38:01] you'd be a servant of christ
[1:38:02] he said it's not up to the branham
[1:38:04] tabernacle neither is it up to any other
[1:38:07] church
[1:38:10] he said it's up to you i take that
[1:38:13] personally brother joe
[1:38:14] i take that personally it's up to me as
[1:38:16] an individual
[1:38:18] oh god say brother ben have you always
[1:38:21] been ready no but i believe i'm ready
[1:38:23] now
[1:38:23] and i so badly want every day to be
[1:38:26] ready
[1:38:28] say oh my brother ben you're predestined
[1:38:30] i know the predestination will go but
[1:38:32] the predestination have a desire
[1:38:33] to put on the wedding dress that he gave
[1:38:35] her
[1:38:37] rebecca had a desire to water the camel
[1:38:39] she didn't even know why
[1:38:42] she had a desire to go with him she said
[1:38:44] yes i'll go
[1:38:45] he gave her the decision she said yes
[1:38:47] i'll go and i say yes
[1:38:48] i'll stay awake i'll be right with god
[1:38:51] if it takes me down in an ultra i'll do
[1:38:53] it
[1:38:54] if it takes me crying out before god at
[1:38:56] home i'll do it
[1:38:57] if it takes me giving up everything i'll
[1:38:59] do it because i want to be ready
[1:39:02] not because i'm afraid but because i i
[1:39:05] don't want to miss it because i want to
[1:39:06] be with him
[1:39:07] hell for me would be not to be with him
[1:39:14] i've said this before i don't stand
[1:39:16] before you as a perfect man
[1:39:19] far from it but you've got to get in
[1:39:22] your life to the point where the pain
[1:39:24] of the separation from god is
[1:39:28] worse to you than the thrill
[1:39:31] that you get from doing whatever you're
[1:39:33] doing
[1:39:39] you sit there and gossip about somebody
[1:39:40] but it separates you
[1:39:44] is it worth it
[1:39:49] that presence just goes to gable in your
[1:39:51] soul you're not lost
[1:39:53] but that presence just isn't there but
[1:39:54] there's something in the bride
[1:39:56] that wants to be in his presence
[1:40:01] he wants to be in his presence brother
[1:40:04] said it's up to you as an individual to
[1:40:06] be ready at the coming of the lord you
[1:40:08] must be ready
[1:40:09] i must be ready
[1:40:12] this is the way he puts this he says
[1:40:15] i'll sweep my own steps
[1:40:19] oh god i just had this visual brother
[1:40:22] brandon i'm cleaning his steps for the
[1:40:24] coming of the lord
[1:40:25] he's coming i'm getting ready you know
[1:40:26] how you get ready when somebody's coming
[1:40:28] to the house
[1:40:30] send peter out there with the blower and
[1:40:32] blow off the
[1:40:33] the back porch and the in the front yard
[1:40:37] the driveway why
[1:40:41] i want them to be comfortable i want to
[1:40:43] be able i want them to come in i don't
[1:40:45] think it's an abandoned house they might
[1:40:46] think that sometimes up to me to sweep
[1:40:50] my own steps
[1:40:54] every once in a while as a pastor i just
[1:40:55] have to get it has to be real enough to
[1:40:57] me sometimes
[1:40:58] so that i'll turn around and sweep my
[1:41:01] steps
[1:41:02] sweep out from behind the pulpit sweep
[1:41:04] the clutter out of my mind
[1:41:06] it's got to be that real to me that i'm
[1:41:08] willing to sweep my own steps
[1:41:11] but he said it's up to you to sweep your
[1:41:13] steps
[1:41:15] how long has it been since you swept
[1:41:17] your steps
[1:41:20] this is what he said said leave mine
[1:41:21] alone me leave yours alone
[1:41:23] you've got to make your garment ready
[1:41:27] how long has it been since you swept
[1:41:29] your steps how long has it been
[1:41:31] since you just really decided that this
[1:41:33] service this this prayer time
[1:41:35] this time i'm gonna i'm gonna make sure
[1:41:37] that i can connect with god
[1:41:39] listen we're living in a deceitful age
[1:41:41] i've had people sit and tell me but i
[1:41:42] thought i was okay
[1:41:44] because i still felt the presence of the
[1:41:45] lord in church i still could raise my
[1:41:47] hands
[1:41:48] i thought i was okay doing what i did
[1:41:50] because i could understand it
[1:41:51] intellectually
[1:41:52] and realize not realize that they're
[1:41:54] what they're doing is directly against
[1:41:55] the word
[1:41:57] but it's up to you as an individual to
[1:41:59] sweep your own steps i thought i was
[1:42:01] okay because i went to word of life
[1:42:02] tabernacle
[1:42:03] i thought i was okay because until you
[1:42:05] realize there will be people there on
[1:42:06] that day
[1:42:07] not everybody that heard brother branham
[1:42:09] eve went in
[1:42:10] there will be people that heard a
[1:42:11] prophet of god when he was alive on the
[1:42:13] earth
[1:42:14] that will not make it and they'll be in
[1:42:16] the tribulation period
[1:42:17] they'll be crying out saying i thought i
[1:42:18] was okay
[1:42:20] because i heard a prophet
[1:42:24] but i didn't preach my own i didn't
[1:42:27] sweep my own steps
[1:42:36] i know i'm not condemning you i'm one of
[1:42:40] you i'm a hearty i
[1:42:41] suck the rest of you whatever people
[1:42:43] want to call you
[1:42:45] i don't like it when people talk bad
[1:42:47] about people around here because there's
[1:42:49] some real
[1:42:50] people of god around here real jewels of
[1:42:53] god
[1:42:54] and yet i realize
[1:42:58] that you know you have different spirits
[1:43:01] in different areas we tend to sweep
[1:43:02] other people's steps
[1:43:07] i don't have to sweep the step at the
[1:43:09] church next door
[1:43:12] i can't even sweep yours
[1:43:15] all i can do is hand you a broom here
[1:43:17] you go
[1:43:23] sweep your own steps
[1:43:27] but say that to anybody listen sweep
[1:43:28] your own steps i'm not worried about
[1:43:30] getting somebody from
[1:43:31] i don't want to i don't want nobody from
[1:43:32] another church i don't want him any
[1:43:34] other sheep
[1:43:34] i want to reach somebody that that's
[1:43:36] lost
[1:43:38] that's somebody that's found sweep our
[1:43:40] own let's sweep our own steps

[1:44:36] don't know
[1:44:37] they don't have to god has different
[1:44:39] callings different ministries

[1:44:43] tells me to do
[1:44:45] and the other day in my office i'm
[1:44:47] sitting there reading that quote and god
