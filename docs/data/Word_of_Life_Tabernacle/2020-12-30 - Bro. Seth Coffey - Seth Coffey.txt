makes you feel at home you know like I said you can you know I was with my buddy Jacob and he said you know we walked in that church and as soon as they started singing it felt like I was at home and I was like yeah because they got the same Spirit we do the Holy Spirit and it's keeping us alive amen amen if you have your bibles if you would turn to Hebrews the 12th chapter starting at the first verse if we could um before we read if we could just talk to the author this evening dear gracious and eternal Heavenly Father Lord Lord we come before you Lord God this evening Lord with nothing to offer Lord Lord there's nothing that I could do or say Lord God to help these people father but Lord if you would come Lord God and just use me as one of your instruments Lord God lord just come Lord God you know the needs of the people I don't Lord God I believe Lord if we could look Beyond the Veil Lord this evening Lord we would see a need over here and a need over there Lord and maybe some hurt over here Lord God and Lord I I can't see it Lord but Beyond the Veil Lord you already knew it before the foundation of the world Lord God lord we just pray Lord this evening Lord God lord Jesus Lord we believe Lord God that you are still the same yesterday today and forever Lord God lord we believe that you're in our midst in this building Lord God this evening Lord God Lord that you can still come Lord and discern the hearts of the people Lord that it wouldn't be a man Lord God but that you could come Lord God Lord that you would speak to the people Lord God lord I pray Lord that I could get so out of the way Lord to completely surrender my body Lord that it would be the same as you speaking to the people Lord God this evening Lord Lord that you would just touch them Lord God be with them Lord and as we turn this word over to you Lord God lord we just ask that you would have complete and full preeminence in this service Lord God lord and if there any Glory father God at the end of it Lord any glory Lord God that would be coming from the pull pit or any Glory that would be coming Lord from the congregation Lord God let it all be sent un to you Lord God because you are the only one God that is worthy to be praised Lord God lord we just ask that you would have your will in this service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I would like to take a title tonight the author and finisher of our faith Amen in Hebrews 12 1-2 it says wherefore sing We also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses it says let us a lay aside every weight and the sin which doeth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us and here it is looking unto Jesus many people look under so many different things whether it be for Faith whether it be for wealth whether it be for so many things but you know that all those things just fade away it says heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall stay the same and the end of the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh so we can look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen that's a sure steadfast thing who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen you may be seated I um I was trying to figure out kind of what what to speak on and didn't thought I had something that I was going to speak on and it just seemed like the Lord really wasn't in it you know you're sitting there and just kind of thinking throughout the week and yesterday me and brother Ben met for lunch and and and you know it's just funny how the Lord Works things out because all the places that brother Ben asked me to go he asked me to meet me at this one place and it was some place on the lake and or some place called that on the lake I can't remember what it was but but when it did the Carol was on like I believe it was but it took me through this place and I looked up on this on this hill and I remembered about nine or 10 years ago I was 15 years old and 25 now so I guess that'd be 10 years I I came by this way I just had gave my heart to the Lord not long before that back home in North Carolina and and I seen that waterfall and when we was in my mind and when we got done eating I went back to that waterfall and I began to climb that waterfall and and just like I remembered it was you know all those years ago and and got up to the top and look around and and I began to turn around and and look back Across The View and it just something hit me and and you begin to think oh God I'm a young Christian I understand that but I've been serving the lord for 10 years now and and I look back at that and I said oh God all all the things Lord that that I've been through not not that I've been through a lot of hurt or a ton of those things but we can all say we've been through trials right and I I begin to look back and I said God everything that I ever went through but Lord you kept me I begin to look back at everything and you know I begin to think you know Lord if you would have shown me in this spot everything that I would have had to go through at that time to get where I am today brother Ben I don't know if I could have took it actually I know I couldn't have took it in that moment true but God who was rich in Mercy thank you Lord we begin to look at that I begin to look at that place and something came over me and I said oh God thank you so much Lord God and something came over me he is the author and the finisher of your faith see God doesn't start a work in somebody not to finish it amen and you understand the thing about an author is nobody else can say they wrote this book but the author so it doesn't really matter what anybody says about your life it doesn't really matter what anybody tries to talk about your life the author and the finisher of your life has the final say of what goes on in your life amen so I began to look at that and and as our brother was singing I remember when I uh I first gave my heart to the Lord and I think it was like the next day or so I was sitting in the church I had a wedding to go to and I remember the first scripture I ever read out of my Bible and it said he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me I am so glad Saints of living God that his power his strength was made perfect in my weakness cuz I can tell you 10 years of that I never had my own strength I never could do it on my own as a person as a man I fail from day to day but there is an anchor inside of the soul that the author has put in there that each and every day we can go through this life with Victory because it's not our strength but he is our strength glory to the Living God it says ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you on than he that is in the world I I think too many times the reason that we mess up brother Ben is we put too much pressure on oursel to get it done we get too much we put too much pressure on oursel to accomplish the things of God but I believe if we could just let go and let the strength of God take over our lives we could accomplish more in a few seconds in the presence of God than we could do in a lifetime Lord glory to the Living God he said for he said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee hallelujah praise God church thank the Lord sitting there in that moment there was many times that maybe I felt forsaken amen can we say that there's many times and we felt alone but in that moment when you get to your weakest point on and you feel like you can't go any further sweet presence of the Lord just sweeps in says I will never leave you nor forsake you and many people you know this is this is this is a year and we heard our brother preach on the worst year of our lives and it's it it's it's something that we've never seen it before I guess maybe since the world wars back in the day that something can be gripped worldwide you were you were not exempt from this everyone was in this and and I sat there and I began to say how did we how did we stand through 2020 you know there was many people that that walked away from the message there was many people that gave up come on but how did you stand through 2020 and then it began to hit me because 2020 wasn't your author come on it wasn't your author everything that Satan could throw at you wasn't your author it says for he sayith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy you never held yourself I never held myself but there was a God that showeth Mercy do you know how grateful you should be in this age of 2020 when everybody has turned down God and everyone has just let things go and everybody has walked over this message but you have found Mercy in the eyes of God that you can serve God that you can believe this message in the last days when people call it garbage and when people turn it around but to you it's the Rapture and grace of God and it's bringing you closer and closer to God each and every day of your life because you have found Mercy in the eyes of God Oh Glory to God I'm going to go ahead and say it because before the found the lamb wasn't slain for you yesterday right on before the very foundation of the world we see that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and you were there with him what did it say in job where were you job when the sons of God shouted for Joy before the foundation of the world you had representation by predestination glory to God you had found Mercy with God not on any particular day but before the foundation of the world God said they are an overcomer he was the author of your faith and he will also be the Finish of your faith glory to God thank you Lord in the highest amen thank you Lord because the author the author held us the author was writing your story you know one thing I thought about it brother what you were preaching on and it goes right along with what he was saying but job never knew what was going on in heaven yeah but the author the whole time was just writing writing down job's life writing down what job was going to do job couldn't see what was going on we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but we know who holds tomorrow thank you Lord there is already if I could put it this way there is already a written letter of your life written and read of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and as much as Satan wants to he can't change that writing he takes his he takes as an eraser but I don't know if you ever tried to take an eraser to a Sharpie it just don't work God Sharpie began to write down just Justified glorified they never done it in the first place and that's your story that the author has wrote thank you Lord it says here Jesus says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out for I am for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father will which he has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing come on but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will this isn't our will now church this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day Lord we have to come to a realization you know even though I know my personal testimony when I gave my heart to the Lord all all 10 years ago or however long I remember I was sitting there and it was brother Joel forny I'm sure most of y'all know him but he came by the church and he was preaching and I was on my way to church that evening and I was smoking on the way to church and and I was sitting there going you know I don't really know why I'm going to this I'm just going because my mom wanted me to so me and my sister went and and I began to sit there and I knew I was wrong when that brother started preaching but I wasn't I wasn't going to to give into that I was sitting there going no I'm not going up there and he started talking about the Holy Ghost and I said man I need that Holy Ghost but still I'm that's I'm not I'm not ready yet I'm too young I got to live my life a little bit before I get to that point and I remember sitting there and that in in about I don't know six or seventh Pew back and I was sitting there going I'm not going I'm not going next thing I know I see my body begin to stand up and my body began to walk out and even when I'm walking down to the front I said I'm not going I'm not going but by the time I got there he said what are you here for I said I've received the Holy Ghost words began to come out of my mouth that I didn't understand because it wasn't my will but it was God's Will and he begin to bring me in he begin to keep me because so many times we begin to try to keep ourselves but you were never the one that saved yourself it was Jesus Christ that saved you before the foundation of the world what did the prophet say he said you were never saved on any particular day he said you just realized you were saved glory to God Satan is not the author of your faith come on since he's not not the author you don't have to listen to him Satan didn't write this book he can't tell you what it means he can't tell you that Isaiah 54 is not for you CU he didn't write the book he don't know what's behind the book right he says Satan says you'll never make it you know I think it's funny Satan is always against us but for some reason we always lend an ear to him yeah that's how miserable of a human ity is we know someone is completely against us but yet we listen to him over and over again he tells you you're not good enough over and over again he tells you you'll never make it and for whatever reason we have decided hey let's not listen to the one that died for us let's listen to the one that's lying to us ever since the beginning it's a sad thing but I know we're all guilty of it but I say it's time to stop listening to him come on it's time to stop listening to his lies because he is not the author of your faith it says this is what God says about you he says talk about a Thanksgiving he said I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of you are the pure you virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washing the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though he never sinned at the first place you are the perfect you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ he said how can I if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place glory to God church do you not realize that day after day after day Satan is constantly going to God and accusing you of things that you've done and accusing you of what you did this morning and accusing you of what you did yesterday and God begins to look through that blood Veil and he begins to see all he can see is his son he doesn't see your sins he doesn't see what you've done now I'm not legalizing sin don't go around doing things you ain't supposed to if you're predestinated you won't be doing those things but he begins to look he begins to I love that he begins to try to accuse you over and over and over and guess what he gets added to him another thing of false accusation of the brother glory to God each day he's getting longer and longer in the pits of Hell come on he's adding to his sentence every day more and more and more by falsely accusing you glory to God I begin to think of that when I begin to think of who we listen to and why we listen to you look at shamgar in the Bible and year after year after year he would see the Philistines coming and he knew every time they were coming they were coming to take his god-given rights they were coming to take his land coming to take his crops each and every year and surely each and every time he came up the Philistines be to come they say you know Shemar you're not strong enough for this just get out of the way and take let me let me take your crop and year after a year they kept coming and kept taking his crop over and over and over and over and over again many times we're like shamgar and we get caught up in Cycles over and over and over again but I want to tell you something there has to be a time when you break that cycle there has to be a time where you say enough is enough and shamgar begin to realize he said I'm I'm a circumcised Seed of Abraham which means in our day full of the Holy Ghost Lord shamgar was full of the Holy Ghost and he began to realize this is my land that's my family I this is my promise samgar wasn't going to take it anymore listen Church you don't have to live with what Satan's lying about you CU let me tell you something he's not the author nor the finisher of your faith God is the finisher of your faith so shamgar shamgar just begin to take what he had take you a little scripture one time when you're sick get you Isaiah 5 four go ahead and take it and say the Lord God is my healer by his stripes I am healed the Lord heals all my diseases you can begin to take that and you can begin to take your Ox goat and say Satan enough is enough because you are not the author of my faith you are not the finisher of my faith but Jesus Christ is the author of my face and Jesus Christ is the author of my glory he's the finisher of my faith glory in the most high you look at job and everything that he went through everything that he went through it was a lot worse than what we go through from day to day it was the worst the worst scene we've ever seen outside of Christ all the things that he went through and how did he not give up or how did he why didn't he just give up right because look at the author come on he won't curse me to my face he Satan says oh he'll curse you to your face he's a perfect man thank you Lord many times we're going through the trial but God has has already made preparation for the trial we don't see what's going on in the moment but before the trial ever happened God has already made preparation you say when last week no before the foundation of the world glory to God and I want you to notice this is this is really the text that I wanted to get to I want you to notice that what caused the Revelation to come out of job was the trial that's true we go through this life and and it it's sad to say but you don't we don't call out to God on our good days like we call out to God on our bad days when everything's going great we might say a two-minute prayer I thank you Lord for for the blessings on me and we take off but when you really hit a trial and your world's falling apart that's deeper than yourself that goes beyond what you can do and what you can accomplish it comes to a point where it brings something out of you something along the lines of for I know my redeemer liveth he had these questions I want you to realize job had these questions before the trial ever started but he got his answer at the worst time at the worst time is God begin to come in that's when you get desperate with God in desperations brother Brenham says it's sad that it takes an emergency for us to get desperate and I've said this to brother Ben I said you know sometimes God will let Co come if you're not going to get desperate in your own little world he'll shake the whole world and he'll make you desperate he said for I know my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me I like what brother Ben said that didn't stop his trial but it gave him a revelation to get through the trial Lord God will give you what you need to get through Lord I'd like to read this very familiar scripture and I TI all things work for the bride's good and we know that all things somebody say all things all work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and them whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor dep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord thank you Lord I want you to notice it shall not be able to separate us but that don't mean it ain't going to be there many times we look at a prosperous life but that's not what the Christian walk is look at Paul look at Peter look at all these men beaten thrown in prison come on but that wasn't what it was about what was it about was when you could read those stories and you could look back at the Bible and you could look at those things and you say those men really believe what they said they believed and then you begin to catch the Revelation I have the same Holy Ghost they have brother Ben and if they can grow go through that there is nothing that can separate me from the love of Christ thank you Lord because I want you to realize the trial is what brings out the best in you brother bam says this about Fanny Crosby he said blind Fanny Crosby who was tortured through her life by scornful hands and making fun of her because she wouldn't write worldly songs what thank you f Fanny Crosby let's call you here and what do you think of him whose son is he what does he mean to you Fanny cros yeah and when she picked up of the pen she wrote pass me not oh savior it says hear my humble cry while on others thou are calling do not pass me by thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee or whom in heaven but thee you Lord why did Fanny Crosby write all those songs why did she do what she did because in her blindness she realized the need for our savior thank you Lord many people say that's not fair look at the songs that we have look at how many altar calls there's been by oh pass me not oh gentle savior look at all the people that were saved because of the Affliction of that person we look at so many things and we begin to wonder why this why me why did this happen but behind the veil come on look at her condition scorn you think being blind would be bad enough but then they made fun of her they scorned her but what did it do it only brought out the music Hallelujah it only brings out the music in your life when people begin begin to criticize you and make fun of you for what you believe or what you're doing there's something deeper on the inside of you that goes past yourself and it begins to bring out the music it begins to bring out the life of Jesus Christ on display thank you Lord but we would have never known it had it not been for the trial that we were going through if everything would be perfect in our life you just go about through life you don't give God the time that he needs he deserves amen when things are going great you don't give him what he deserves but he begins to come in and he permits Satan as he did job he permit Satan to come in your life and start flipping things around to where you find your place to where you're on your knees going God I need you again many times we look at the flesh as a bad thing but really if we never had this flesh we wouldn't know the need that we had for God true I heard my pastor preaching one time and he started talking about you know you look at these athletes that only have one Limb and you know have to have a a bionic leg or something like that or a midle leg and and they have these things and and you know there's those that feel sorry for themselves they feel feel sorry for themselves and they begin to waste their themselves away they begin to say there's no hope for me but other ones will begin to use that as inspiration and other ones will begin that to use that they don't use it as a crutch but they use it as something to say inspiration to work harder and try harder and strive harder for the goal amen I thought of this today when I was up there studying and and you know on the way up you always going into Arkansas you got to think about the blind girl and Jonesboro that that the Lord restored her sight and I was looking for something completely else different and the Lord let me let me use it so I'm so thankful for that but I begin to think of the blind girl in Jonesboro and we look at that and we begin to say that's such a sad thing that she was blind but we realize that when we look at we look at her and we look at her situation and here's a blind girl that had I mean I have a daughter and unless she runs off somewhere I ain't going to lose her you know when I'm in a storage you stay right here but her own father had lost her could you imagine not being able to see anything and your own father has lost you knowing and my daughter ain't blind but he knew the condition of his daughter and he lost her so talk about feeling all alone literally can't see and then she begins to lose the faith in humanity because she's bumping into everybody trying to find her father no it seems pitiful and she's beginning to to try to find and people are bumping into and maybe she gets knocked down a couple times and and she keeps on going because she's trying to find her daddy how pitiful and then here's brother brandom over here walking trying to get in and some guy being rude so to speak says hey quit pushing so here's a man that could have lost his temper at this man right and here here's a trial he's facing and even that that that blind girl maybe should have been staying back here with her father but instead she begins to venture over here and begins to attract the attention of a Prophet come on because of her trial yeah because of her trial brother Brandon begins to notice she's she's looking around old daddy old daddy she's beginning to cry in desperation but if it wasn't for her trial come on she would have never ended up at the prophet and she begins to come to the prophet and I love the faith that is found there we know the whole story but she says you get me to the Healer yeah I'll go find my daddy lord it's in a time of desperation Church on that are trial letter straight to the prophet Hallelujah and brother Brandon began to pray for you know using his hand back then and he felt the sensation in her hand of that cataracts in there and when it left he said look up at me and open your eyes and she did and she was restored and I begin to look at that brother stort and I begin to think you know that was great for that girl but you know what it did for me brother Ben through her trial there could be a blind girl walk through that building come on and I could look at her and say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if that girl's eyesight could be restored then this girl's eyesight could be restored we look at our trials and we look at everything that we go through and we don't understand that why we're going through it when we're going through it but people can look at us and go they've got something real how is it that they can go through thing after thing after thing and they're still standing and yet it seems so unfair but the author has wrote it out the whole time we don't understand it brother brandham says it was Moses after being also in the line of his Royal seed the Seed of Abraham that when he was sent down into Egypt to deliver the children of Israel and God had give him signs and wonders to perform and to Smite the Earth and to bring forth frogs and fleas and darkness and hell and rain and fire and and all these Miracles yet when he led them out by the hand of Jehovah there come a time when come a time pardon me when he met the gate between him and the promised land there was the Red Sea a bar across the way they were hemmed in by Pharaoh's Army mountains and deserts and red sea but Moses stepped forward and possessed the Gate of his enemy and cross the Red Sea dry shot and he was walking on Dusty Road he shall possess the Gate of the enemy God said so and it settled it was only a few years later now when the Trials come and the church God All Shook Up as is so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just doesn't seem to happen the way it's supposed to be God makes it that way many people don't like this but God brings tension into the church every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested he let sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you are truly the Seed of Abraham come on church it's not so much proven to you who you are sometimes it's proven to the world that you are the Seed of Abraham Hallelujah he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do it all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he can turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it we are taught that it is more precious than gold to US these things are what identify us as the sons and Daughters of God anybody can live a happy life with no trials on you know I remember one time I was up in Virginia and and there was a there was a fruit it was a pair we took some peirs up there for the deer and and I seen this this beautiful pair and it had no no it had nothing wrong with it it just looked perfect and I picked it up and I bit into it but it was bitter as could be because it was immature it never been through anything it never been through any trials but then I said this old pair and it was had little bruises and everything else over it and I grabbed it and bit into it and it was just as sweet as could be and it reminded me of our savior he was beat all to pieces but yet he went ahead with it because it was the will of the father we look at that trial could you imagine could you imagine the apostles looking at that going why does my savior have to go through this could you imagine them sitting there they didn't really understand what was going on they're going why does he have to do why are they treating him like this why if surely if they could they would run in there and they would stop the trial they would stop everything that he was going through they would go in there and they would rip him off the cross but what if they would have come on that was the worst trial there ever was in The Garden of Gethsemane bleeding blood from his forehead the worst trial there ever was the Temptation that he was under In The Garden of Gethsemane where blood literally started to drop from his forehead how could that be the will of God they're wondering we can look back at the story now and see how it was the will of God but put yourself in the moment how could that be the will of God that this man that has done absolutely nothing wrong he doesn't deserve what he's going through the trial that's set before him and they're sitting there in the garden with him going why is he just call why is he praying so hard why is he going what he's going through he's the son of God why he just why don't he just take this trial away from him why doesn't he just speak this trial away from himself come on Church they don't understand what's going on through the trial but beyond that he's looking and he says because of the joy that sit before me he endured the cross Lord he began to see his trial and begin to embrace his trial come on because it wasn't his will but it was the will of the father but through that trial we found salvation in the moment in the midst of that trial we would begin to say no take him down don't beat my Lord don't do these things he shouldn't go through that but through it all we found our very salvation through his trial hallelujah thank you Lord and it's our trials we don't understand the sickness we don't understand the hurt on I guarantee you one thing Brother David understands healing better now than he did before the trial come on he could say I love Brother David I met him years ago but he could say before the trial I believe God's A Healer brother Ben he could say I believe God's A Healer but until he was in that spot to where he realized his life was on the line on to he realized I need God cuz I can't do this myself he got to that point and Jehovah come on oh my Jesus Christ came in the room and they said you're not going home for a week but he's going home he's home today thank the Lord now he can sit there through his trial and say hey if you got Co I know a Healer Hallelujah because through his trial he gained the victory thank the Lord hallelujah your trials are what identifies you thank the Lord do you realize that we would not have we wouldn't we wouldn't care about the story of David if there was not a Goliath right that's true big deal God becomes king no problems he's the king of all Israel but what we like about David is we say this man defied the the odds through his trials he began there begin to be a line that rose up against him and you know like I said in the church why don't you just try to picture me wrestling a line but picture me a foot shorter and I'm going to go fight a line and what seemed impossible it was a trial of Faith but David already had a revelation David had already been anointed to go to the throne so he said you know what Satan it doesn't matter what you do with this line I have to get to the throne and this line is between my th me and royalty and I want you to realize tonight Church you are predestinated and anointed by the message of the hour to go to royalty so I want you to know it doesn't matter what stands in your way between now and royalty you just take your knife out and you slay it just as David did if there's a bear in your way knock it down if there's a line in your way knock it down if it's the biggest trial of your life and it's Goliath all you need is a simple stone get you faith in Jesus and begin to swing that thing and when the devil gets closer just knock him down come on but we wouldn't care about David if it wasn't for his trials we wouldn't know what victory was if it wasn't for defeat on what was brother Ben saying he said the suffering of this life when he was talking about his father makes me know that there's something over there with no suffering thank Lord praise the Lord Church being confident this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it to the day of Jesus Christ Church we go through many things in this life there's many things we don't understand why we go through them I've been there I give my heart to the Lord next thing I know I'm caught up in false Doctrine but the trial that I went through there I put my faith in in in a in a man instead of the faith in the word and now I could look back at that trial now and I go God because in the moment I'm going God why do I have to go through this why is there so much hurt I haven't done anything to anybody and people hate me because I felt in my heart to leave people hate me people people calling me Serpent seed all these different things God why did I have to go through that but now I know God showed me I don't have faith in a man anymore I have faith in the word of God I have faith in the message of the hour because if I walk away for being that don't affect you when you have faith in the word if you walk away come on that don't affect me that's right CU see brother Ben wasn't my absolute nor am I his absolute abolute come on but the word of God is our absolute Hallelujah and God is the author and the finisher of our faith thank you Lord so each trial that we go through tomorrow when you wake up you know what let me tell you something you might have a problem with temper and you say Lord deliver me of this temper your boss man's going to get on you tomorrow yeah come on boss man's going to give you the worst time that you ever had and and you sit there and you're trying to rise up and God said but I thought you want to delivered of that thing yeah and again and again and again and then you maybe you'll blow up and you say God I realized I can't do it and I'm trying to do it on my own and just like that they'll deliver you from it but we don't we don't understand the trial in the moment but I want you to understand even though we don't we don't understand what's going on in the moment I want you to realize brother brandom had a gift he could see Visions he could see these things he had a prophetic gift but just because there's not a sear here doesn't mean the vision isn't still going on there's many things in this building right now that none of you can see but yet there is a the Holy Ghost is dealing with that one over there and the Holy Ghost is speaking to this one over here and the person over there just got healing because how did he know that about me all that time all those trials I was going through about that temper that makes sense now God just showed me through that there's so many things but I want you to notice that woman that was the woman that was had a baby you know in Mexico her little baby had died but in desperation in her desperation to get to the Healer or to get to get to brother brandham to get to Jesus we understand all these things but in her desperation to get there it wasn't that she could walk up to the front row she began to have to fight Imagine This Church someone someone in church just trying to get prayed for and everyone is pushing her back everyone is beginning to push her back and not let her come forth but in her desperation she continues to fight and continues to go and continues to push and it begins to cause the vision to take place and in her desperation as she begins to cry out she touches God but you know what made her realize that God could raise her baby I believe it was a blind man that had his eyesight restored that man's trial through the healing of his eyes made her realize that my baby could live again Hallelujah and how many people had heard the story of how the baby lived again would come to the message messages of the meetings later and be able to say I I know that that baby was raised back to life and and I have a baby what is it I believe it's called the water head baby where they kept the head was just so big they said I know if you if if God could do that for that baby he could do that for my baby on trial after trial after trial Satan is not showing his power as we think but God is showing his power through your trial thank you Lord when people look at you and your world is turned absolutely upside down and they don't understand understand how you keep going come on but you do and you know as I was saying when I was standing on that waterfall and I was looking across at those times I could not go through every trial that I was going to go through brother stew I couldn't have handled it at that time I was still a pair that was bitter but trial after trial I don't have the problems I used to brother Ben yeah the things that once I struggled with you begin to overcome and the next trial makes you stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger in Rapture Lord I think it's therefore I would rather glory in my infirmities knowing that the power of God May rest upon me you see Church many times we look at our trials as a bad thing but see God is going to put you where you need to be see he has wrote the book he has wrote the story of your life and as much as we don't like it if he needs to get that temper out of us he's going to say boss man and put you through it to get you where you need to be because he is the author and he is going to make sure that we are where we need to be but it's not that your trials are not not even necessarily something that you've done but God is going to put you to a place where you need to be because God is more concerned I don't want to say God isn't concerned about your friends he is concerned about your friends but he's not going to be concerned about your friends when your friends are what is keeping you from a body change come on if you have too many friends that you're talking to them instead of talking to the Lord he'll pull those away from you to get you where you need to be with him because he's not he don't care about how many likes you have on Facebook he don't care about how many friends you have on Facebook he cares about if you and your children are born again he cares about if you're living an overcoming life because let's face it things in this life don't matter men's life is but a vapor we get so many days in this life and then it's over we put way too much emphasis on this life it don't matter how many life we get on Facebook come on no matter how many people liked your picture on Instagram or or all these different things or how successful you can be in this life are you born again that's are you ready for a Rapture and if you're not when the fiery Trials come upon you it's more precious than gold for you God CU see I remember when I was 14 years old and I told my mom I was going to be a preacher and she said no you're not and I said yes I am she said no you're not because she she knew all the pain that came with being a minister because her dad was a pastor but I said you know what's the funniest thing to me that Satan we look at Satan and we're so scared of him and and all these different things but he's just a tool in the hand of God on and I said one day I'm gonna I'm yet to do it but I said one day I'm going to preach a sermon on Satan a tool in the hand of God because what's so Satan time and time again this is the funny thing about Satan how how dumb he is he puts us through trials and every time he puts you through something you come out better than you were before the trial yeah and so because of that he's going to put you through a harder trial yeah to try to break you but then he makes you even better Christian on but because that didn't work he's going to put you through an even harder trial and before you know it you're going to be sitting there and you're going to go he's going to do everything that he can to beat you down everything that he can to break break you but in the midst of your trial when you come to your desperate point at the end of your trial when you come to desperation and the vision takes place you'll say I know my redeemer liveth because you get to a point brother Ben that you realize I couldn't hold myself all this time I couldn't have done it I couldn't have overcame those things I should have gave up but greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world Hallelujah glory to God can't we see it Church of the Living God Apostle Paul all the Christians he killed and all the things that he did but One Moment In the presence of that life completely changed him to where he was ready to kill people to where he was ready to give his life for that message that identifies to us that Paul is a true Messenger but if Paul never went through that trial he would never be able to say oh death come on where is your Victory oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory that trial identified to us that Paul had something greater Lord he was trying to follow follow the law of the Jews in the Old Testament and kill all these Christians but because of that trial it sparked something on the inside of him it brought out the music like it did Fanny crossby through the trial thank you Lord through the trial brings the music thank you Lord musicians come back I don't know how long I preached but God is going to do what God has to do to get you where you need to be and like I said it's not necessarily because you did did something wrong but if you need something but don't be hateful for the trial be thankful for the trial Lord because you have come to such a point where you're so beat down and you're so broken that you fall at the Master's feet and right there you find that that's your true absolute that's your only friend that's the one that's there for you and you realize God in the midst of my trial I didn't understand what was going on I didn't know what I was going through but looking back I can see all the things that you brought me through and all the things how many can look back at your life and go Lord I can see all the things that you bought brought me through and It's Made Me Stronger where God I know if I had to go through that I could go through it I could do it again because God brought me through it the first time I can do it again so let's not be so in we can remember the trials that we went through but what about the trials of tomorrow tomorrow what about the trials of next week what if 2021 is twice as bad as 2020 we can look back and say God held me through 2020 yeah he can hold me through 2021 and if 2021 is twice as bad if Satan is dumb enough again yeah to go let's make 2021 twice as hard as 2020 then you'll have a bride that's twice as strong as they were in 2020 thank you Lord and if he decides to do it again in 2024 you'll have a bride that's four times as strong because the trials only bring out the music my God is awesome he can move my go ahead brother Allan God is awesome he can move mountains keep me in the valley hide me from the rain My God is Awesome heals me when I'm broken strength will I been weak forever he will reain my God is awesome awesome aome awesome my God is awesome my God is awesome let me tell you oh this is the last chance unless you go to a watch night tonight's the last chance that you'll have you say brother Seth I've got things in my life that I realize over in 2020 that I don't want to to carry into 2021 I've got an encouraging word for you as if as I was listening to the prophet on the way up here I was listening to the Jonesboro series and I can't remember what he was dealing with but he said Hey sir you in the back with that trouble if you don't want it to be that way anymore it don't have to just accept it and I thought man brother Ben it didn't take him jumping up and screaming and running around the church he just had to accept it let's just stand and worship him I want to tell you tonight when we go through this last bit of the service I want you to thank in your heart everything that you've went through in 2020 everything and I want you to look at how God has kept you look at all the trials that you went through in 2019 you said I would have never made it through I couldn't have made it look through that look through those eyes in these last few minutes give him the worship he deserves because he held you through those trials he held you through those times he kept you when your brother and your sister went away and left the message he held you you had found Mercy with God

long ways since January 1 and I want us to thank God for that and and in each of your own lives you can look and maybe you've been through a lot and you can say God kept me he kept me I've been through the trial I've been through the fire but he's kept me now it's the end of the year and it's it's time to turn the page over to a new year but if he kept me this year like the brother said he'll keep me in the next year that much more if the trials are worse and we pray that they're not but if the trials are worse next year he'll keep me in the next year let's just talk to God for a
