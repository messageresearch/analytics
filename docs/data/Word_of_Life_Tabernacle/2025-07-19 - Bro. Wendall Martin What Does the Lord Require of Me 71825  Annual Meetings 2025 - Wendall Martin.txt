Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with 10 thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression? For the fruit or the fruit of my body, for the sin of my soul? Hath he thath thee? Hath he hath showed thee, oh man, &gt;&gt; what is good? &gt;&gt; What do the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly &gt;&gt; with thy God? &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer.

Lord, take things out of our hearts that need to be taken out and add those things that should. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, I ask that you would hide us all behind the cross. &gt;&gt; That you would anoint your servant, Lord, to only say what you would want me to say. I ask for liberty, Lord, to be amongst us all. We give ourselves to you now. In Jesus name we pray. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated. I want to take a uh a thought out of this scripture here. Amen. What does the Lord require of me? &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; that was the question that the worshipper was asking. What does the Lord require of me? I I want to come into his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to bow down before the most high. &gt;&gt; Right. What what would please the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall I come with yearling calves and burnt offerings and thousands of rams or Amen 10,000 rivers of oil? &gt;&gt; You You What can I do? Give me a list. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because nothing is too great. You name it, I I will do it. Lord, I will do anything to prove my love to you. I I I I'll Amen. I I I I'll just whatever is required. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd climb the highest mountain to seek your approval. I &gt;&gt; Amen. I' I'd be a missionary in Africa if if if I knew that you would be pleased with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are and I and I and I want to say, Amen. It's not always in will worship. God's not looking for will worship. Right. &gt;&gt; God's not looking for, Amen. somebody that's got a lot to offer. &gt;&gt; God's not looking for a rich man who will, Amen. put a lot of money in the offering plate or &gt;&gt; God's not looking for some super duper talent. &gt;&gt; God's not interested in we'll worship. &gt;&gt; God is interested in the worshipper. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, there are many that show the great uh incredible acts of will worship there. Brother Brandham would talk about the the the ones the natives uh you know overseas that that would walk over the hot coals, hot bed of coals. They there there are many. I I've I've I've I've preached among the Native American uh um much in my ministry and and they've got scars in their in their heads and their chest and their Amen. from those who have done the Sundance and doing a lot of things to to try to earn the presence of God or to to to to come and and and to prove that uh they're sincere in their worship. It's something that they that they longed uh uh to to for the creator to know that they truly love him and they try to do it in one way or another. But see, God's not interested. Amen. And I, you know, I've been even in the Pentecostal realm. I was raised in a Amen. in the apostolic world to where Amen. The guys couldn't wear short sleeves and Amen. You you you didn't wear rings and hallelujah. You couldn't wear your hair in the middle. I don't know what I'm going to do now. Hallelujah. Amen. Uh there there were a lot of these things. Your skirt had to touch your ankles. There there was a lot of things that men have put together in order to try to appease God and to please God. And then we come up with man-made righteousness. We come up with man-made Amen. You know, and we can judge one another that way. Well, I'm more holy than you. I'm more. God loves me more. I love God more. But God's not interested in will worship. &gt;&gt; God's not interested, Amen. in somebody. He's looking for somebody who will give him their lives. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Mankind wants the status quo, a list of dos and don'ts to to to judge by. Can you say amen? But worship is more than lip service in a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship is not merely a rutistic a ritualistic form. Many times we have the attitude of this is what we do and this is how we do it and Lord this is what I'm giving you here tonight. And and and I wonder sometimes if we walk out of the service and we miss everything. We miss the presence of God. We leave the presence of God. Amen. Where his heart does not touch our hearts &gt;&gt; is because we have added things and we have subtracted things and all God is truly interested in is all of you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, you can have all of the forms, you can have the rituals, you can have the quotes, you can have everything &gt;&gt; and still be a formal powerless church member. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then the prophecy that was spoke of the first coming of Christ would come to pass in the bright coming of Christ. Amen. Where Jesus said, "This people drawth nigh unto me with their mouth and honorth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." &gt;&gt; I should have had brother Andrew preach again tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's looking for worshippers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "God wants a complete surrender." &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? God wants a surrender. How can God show you realities before you surrender yourself to him? You've got to surrender. Listen, you've got to surrender. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I don't think we should ever come to church with a critical spirit. I I don't think we should come to church with a Amen. with a a complacent attitude. I'm just coming to show up. I'm just coming to to to pay my dues. I'm just coming because this is what is required of me to do. Well, can you say amen? Often time we offer God poor praise. We come tired. Amen. We're not interested in the moving of the spirit because we are meeting a status quo and that's all that matters to us. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you there's some sons and daughters of God, amen, that is going to stand up to the occasion and say, "God, I want to be everything that you've ordained me to be. I want to be the bride that you've called me to be. I want to be the powerhouse that you've called me to be. If my name was put on that book, then let me manifest that book. Let me give everything I am to the cause of Jesus Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says God is among his sons and daughters. And yet we can fail to understand what God is doing today, &gt;&gt; why he's revealing himself and &gt;&gt; and where God is taking us and &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and the restoration. Why are we to be re uh restored back to &gt;&gt; there? Psalms 82 and1. &gt;&gt; It says God standeth in the congregation of the mighty. &gt;&gt; He judges among the gods. How long will you judge unjustly? &gt;&gt; And accept the person of the wicked. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Defend the poor and the fatherless. Do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy. And rid them out of the hand of the wicked. Yet they know not. Neither will they understand. They walk on in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are out of course. &gt;&gt; I have said you are gods, &gt;&gt; and all of you are children of the most high. But you die like men &gt;&gt; and fly and fall like one of the princes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, what am I getting to here tonight? &gt;&gt; I believe God is looking for surrendered hearts. &gt;&gt; He's looking for his uh uh his body that he can manifest his word to &gt;&gt; and through. Now, Brother Brandham would tell us, he said, "Cain worshiped." &gt;&gt; He says, "All of all of his carnal works," &gt;&gt; he said, "Just like the carnal church today, &gt;&gt; they go to church. &gt;&gt; They worship. Cain worshiped. &gt;&gt; He wasn't an infidel. He wasn't a communist. Cain was a believer. &gt;&gt; He went to God. He built an altar. He done everything religious that Abel done, but he didn't have the spiritual revelation of the will of God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. There you are. Do you see it? He didn't have the spiritual revelation. That's what's the matter with the church today. Jesus said he'd built his church on that spiritual revelation. He says, "Do you get it? Oh my, your eyes can come open now and see the spiritual revelation." Cain came and he built an altar. He worshiped. He brought sacrifice. He knelt down. He praised God. He worshiped God. But he done everything religious that Abel done. And God flatly refused him because he didn't have the spiritual revelation. Somebody say, "God, give me revelation." Follow the same line of Cain right down through the ark and through the ark unto Israel from Israel to Jesus from Jesus right now till today and see if that carnal fundamental stiff and starchy scholarly I I mean man who have the scriptures who knows all the doctrines and the theologies and they can explain it boy just like that but without the spiritual revelation. So if I am going to be accepted by God and my worship is going to be accepted by God then my worship must be according to divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Well can you say amen? So it's not in my jumping and my shouting. It's not in my speaking in tongues. It's not in my prophecies. It's not in how good I can preach. How good I can sing. It's in my worship according to divine revelation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someone say, "Thank God for revelation." &gt;&gt; You might not be rich, but if you've got revelation, are y'all hearing me here tonight? It's not who's who. It's the divine revelation within you. &gt;&gt; Now, That's it. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Worship has much to do with your words. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an incredible honor to come before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an honor to express our love with words. &gt;&gt; It's it's an honor. Amen. To to sing an expression of our worship and our heart and we testify of his goodness. And I believe congregational praise is important. &gt;&gt; I do. Many membered bride, the body of Christ coming together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you that's showing up for halfway through song service, you should be ashamed of yourself &gt;&gt; because it's showing you, it's showing the people around you that you might not be worshiping according to revelation. &gt;&gt; Those that are only amen showing up to church for your favorite preacher, it might be showing that your worship is not well praise the Lord. For those of you, Amen. that is trying to just follow the high class in the message or the the best preacher of the message. I want to tell you, you better get a revelation because God's got a body here on this earth that he's going to reflect himself through. He's going, "Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that body." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 107 and 31. Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wondrous works to the children of men. Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders. Psalms 111 and 1. Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation. God believes in going to church, &gt;&gt; but worship is not acceptable worship. All right. &gt;&gt; Until it's revelated worship. &gt;&gt; Because what God's looking for is somebody to understand his purpose, his will, his plan for this generation &gt;&gt; so that he can live his works &gt;&gt; through them. When Jesus said, "Search the scriptures for they declare who I am." &gt;&gt; And they are they that that you're thinking that you've got eternal life by. &gt;&gt; You are worshiping something that you don't have a revelation of. And I just want this to really sink in deep because this bride, the only thing that separates you from another denomination is the spirit of God and divine revelation. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see the revelation of what God is doing in your hour. &gt;&gt; The heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a deep understanding of what God wants from his bride. &gt;&gt; Did you know that the prophet said the bride will do nothing except God first shows her? She has found her place in him in such a way that everything about her and her attitude and her thought process is to honor &gt;&gt; him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When revelation truly strikes home of what God has redeemed you young men for, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, &gt;&gt; your worship changes. when when it really strikes home of what God's called us ministers for &gt;&gt; our preaching changes &gt;&gt; when it well come on church that we are in the final stretch &gt;&gt; that the anointing is upon the body of believers and that we are fixing to go into a rapture into a body change. You know what that does? It takes the lackness away. It takes the insincerity away. And it brings about a reality of more of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then praise takes on a different nature. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise becomes an expression of Amen. Well, the musicians aren't there tonight, but God, here I am. Hallelujah. I love you. I thank Well, can you say amen? Amen. Your praise is no longer, well, I'm having a good day. It don't matter whether I'm having a good day or a bad day. I'm just honored. I'm part of the great plan of redemption. Amen. Well, I I my my lights have just been shut off. Oh, but I'm thankful that there is the almighty hand of God upon me and has separated me to himself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise becomes an expression of respect and gratitude, &gt;&gt; an enthusiastic expression &gt;&gt; of love &gt;&gt; and admiration. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Why? Because there is a revelation of God doing something right now. in you. &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and say, "God's doing something right now &gt;&gt; in you." &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When you get that kind of a revelation, the church body becomes extremely important to you. [Applause] When you get that kind of a revelation that I belong to the to to the earthly body of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; then I understand that I cannot do it without you and you cannot do it without him and he can't do it without you. And maybe you guys don't even Hallelujah. can't even stay in the same room together. But there is a reality there saying I need you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, the church conflict is all over then because now there's a revelation. I belong to the literal body. Amen. The the the the the earthly body of the Lord Jesus Christ. But come on, church. Amen. If we had that kind of a revelation, amen, there wouldn't be all of this nonsense that goes on and all the fussing and the fighting and the feuding. Amen. And the sarcasm. There'd be a reality that I belong to something greater than me. I am part of a body that is greater than me. I am a member of the supernatural body bride of Jesus Christ. The realities of God are in me expressing through me to my brother. Can you say amenise? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When you catch the revelation of the will of God today &gt;&gt; that you belong to that body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll know. &gt;&gt; You'll know &gt;&gt; that your brother's important. &gt;&gt; Is this okay here tonight? &gt;&gt; It's no wonder that Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church." &gt;&gt; What was that rock? &gt;&gt; The revelation &gt;&gt; of who he is. If Jesus were to quote that today, upon this rock, will I build my church? It would have to be the revelation of who the bridebody of Christ would be. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; When we look at the desperation, we look at the call, we look at the responsibility upon the shoulders of the bride of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; man, it should throw us into desperation because there is a loan of responsibility. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; that is upon your shoulders. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're old or whether you're young. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're a pastor, an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether you're uh uh whether you are running the sound, &gt;&gt; whether you're a musician. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm wanting you to feel the load of the responsibility tonight. &gt;&gt; Because this all rests upon the shoulders &gt;&gt; of his earthly body. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus responsibility. It was Jesus responsibility to surrender his will to God. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus responsibility to say not my will but thy will be done. &gt;&gt; My meat is to do the will of him that sent me. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he come to earth for a purpose. The father's purpose. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder Jesus got along really well with the father. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he was the father." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that he had to &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; He had to die to his flesh every day. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham. Hallelujah. Josh sent me a quote and I almost used it, but I thought, well, you probably going to preach that here in a minute or later on. But Amen. I It was a It was a powerful quote. Amen. where brother Brandham is talking about Jesus had to die to the will of the father &gt;&gt; and so does he. So do you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham would say in ashamed he says his word has to live itself out for every generation in desperations. Brother Brandham would say amen. See it working and showing that it's not a man it's not just a preacher. It's not a certain congregation. It's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ. Now it's embodied in the body of his bride. And that should throw us into desperation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm here with a purpose. &gt;&gt; I'm responsible. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; For this message, And we can shout around the message all we want &gt;&gt; and we can say amen and do little twirls on every service. &gt;&gt; But if we ain't got the revelation and it's not sinking into you and you're not finding yourself harnessed up to that word, &gt;&gt; your worship's in vain. &gt;&gt; Good job, brother Windle. Keep it up. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Think I will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doing all right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You surrender yourself to that word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The word living in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible bride. &gt;&gt; Not some man-made bride. &gt;&gt; The Bible bride. &gt;&gt; Smitten and afflicted of God. &gt;&gt; No beauty that we should desire her. But we But yet we did esteem her. Smitten and afflicted of God. That's right. She stands alone. She is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelations 3. She is smitten out of the Leoysian church age. She was raised up in see. Amen. The church was raised up in the Leosian age. That's the husk. Amen. It goes on. She stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of man and despised and rejected of the churches. The bride stands that way. What is it? It is his masterpiece. It's the word that he can work through. &gt;&gt; It's the word that he Oh, come on, church. You are that predestinated word for this day. And you're the word that he can work through and manifest himself through. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good preach. Owning up to our responsibilities &gt;&gt; is acknowledging and accepting &gt;&gt; the consequences. Responsibility is to owning up to it is to literally means to acknowledge and accept the consequences of our actions. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Both the positive and the negative. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Rather than shifting the blame &gt;&gt; to somebody else. But to look in the mirror and say, "Hey, Bubba, &gt;&gt; you're just stupid." &gt;&gt; And you need to surrender your will to God. &gt;&gt; And don't be telling your neighbor they're stupid. I say, "Look in the mirror." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shifting the blame is I could be a better Christian if my wife. I could be a better Christian if my husband. I could be a better Christian if my pastor. I could do a whole lot better. Well, I want to tell you, Eve was doing pretty good when she fell. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But the the prophet said, "The bride will not fail in this day." &gt;&gt; Why? Because she's been given a word and she's got a sense of responsibility about her. She's not taking this message and just playing with it. She's taking this message and she's coming under the headship of that word and she's saying, "God, be it unto me according to thy word." Come on, church. Be it unto me. And I think before God can ever use us, we're going to have to surrender our wills. We're going to have to surrender our sins. We're going to have to surrender the big eyes and the little U's. We're going to have to surrender it all. lay it on the altar and say, "God, whatever you've called me for, I want you to anoint me. I want you to forgive me. I want you to take me to Calvary and wash me from my selfish ways. Wash me from my egotistic spirit. Wash me from my pride." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. owning up to our responsibilities. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the prophet said. We've got to own up to our responsibilities. &gt;&gt; He says it's where Amen. It's about taking personal accountability for our choices. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And then we're accountable for the outcomes. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't the preacher's fault that your kids are backslid. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It ain't the guy. Amen. In the schoolyard that's responsible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're my sons. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They're your daughters. &gt;&gt; How you raise them in your home. &gt;&gt; Well, y'all got real quiet there. Maybe we ought to preach here for a little bit. &gt;&gt; It does matter what you allow in your home. &gt;&gt; It does matter that your children sees you going to church. It does matter, Amen, that you pay your tithe. It does matter that you walk with God. It does matter that your children seize your faithfulness in the house of God. It does matter for us preachers, amen, to be humble before the name of the Lord and to show the realities of his wired in humility before the congregation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's important. &gt;&gt; There is a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; If the word of God says &gt;&gt; that the love of many would wax cold &gt;&gt; and the prophet's interpretation of that scripture that there would not be any love found anywhere in the world except for in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's a pretty heavy weight of responsibility. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Responsibility refers to the obligation to do something. The accountability is the estate of being answerable for those results. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says, "And when you see this in this day now when the word of God has been has made these promises of things that we see happening now, now then we've got to take the responsibility &gt;&gt; to either face up to it or get away from it. &gt;&gt; You just can't stay neutral. &gt;&gt; You've got to do something about it. &gt;&gt; Some move has got to be made. You can't come in that church door and go out the same person you came in. You're either further away or closer to God every time you come in or go out. &gt;&gt; Oh, how easy it is for people to sherk these things. He says, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is the requirement? Amen. I don't want your things. I want you. When I have you, then you'll gladly give in the re through the revelation of why you're giving. &gt;&gt; Prophet says you can, God can only use what we give him, &gt;&gt; what we give to him. &gt;&gt; Now, there is a lot of you will say, I give 15 minutes on Sunday morning. If you preach any longer than that, I'll just get up and go home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, &gt;&gt; most of you stayed. Hallelujah. That's good. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, he says that's that's what that's what you give to God. Amen. Some of them said, "Well, maybe I can suffer a half hour. I I don't know how how I can do it." Well, see, then then that's what you get. 15 minutes, a half hour. What What can you give? The prophet is asking, "What can you give?" God will receive what you'll give him. But God wants all of you. &gt;&gt; He wants every bit of you. He wants all. He wants everything you are. He wants your life. He wants your testimony. He wants every minute you live. He wants to live right, act right, talk right, do right. He wants everything perfectly surrendered to him that he can lead you and guide you and put you in places he wants you to go. &gt;&gt; Led &gt;&gt; of the spirit. I'm the body. &gt;&gt; I'm the body. There's a revelation that is striking my heart &gt;&gt; that I am his body. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, "You take yours first and go out and spend and have your big times." And &gt;&gt; when you go to church on Sunday morning, you give him a quarter. Come &gt;&gt; on now. &gt;&gt; But you go and buy a $50 present to give the Joneses that lives next door to you or something. Amen. Enough to get up in your society ranks and then give Jesus the last. &gt;&gt; There's a bunch of these kind of quotes. &gt;&gt; The unwelcome Christ. He said he's worthy of the best. What do you do for him? &gt;&gt; You give him the leftover. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wendle, now now listen. &gt;&gt; I like last night's preaching because it was revelated." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Better say amen about my preaching tonight, too, though. [Applause] Hey, you you see you see what I'm saying? But but but now now this here's just getting to meddling. In order to come into the glorious relationship, in order for the bride to be what God has called this bride to be, then there's got to be some house cleaning. &gt;&gt; There's got to be some attitude cleaning. There's got to be some some real looking. Well, I tell you what, there's going to have to be some phone cleaning, some computer cleaning. There's going to be Come on, church. The things you allow, the things that you put in front of God. &gt;&gt; And yet, God's called you to be his earthly body. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Says he's worthy of your best. What do you give him? The leftover. &gt;&gt; You run around all day and just give him three minutes at night before you go to bed. &gt;&gt; In bed, &gt;&gt; whispering a three-minute prayer. &gt;&gt; Keep my boys, keep my girls, keep my &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you look at your clock and that's only been 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; Revelation &gt;&gt; of the realities. He says, "Oh yes, you run around all day and give him the three minutes at night before you go to bed. &gt;&gt; Jesus deserves your best, friend. &gt;&gt; He deserves everything you got. &gt;&gt; But what do you do about it? &gt;&gt; You give him just anything." And he takes it. He takes it anyhow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He takes it. &gt;&gt; But you know what? He deserves the first place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus ought to have the first place in every life. &gt;&gt; But we give him about the fourth place. He deserves the first. Well, you say, "I pray once a day." Well, that's all right. He receives it. If you want to give him fourth place, that's all right. He'll take it. You only went to church once this year, maybe, and wore the new hat and everything. But he never condemn you for it. That's what makes him God to me. If you want to give him fourth place, fifth place, he will take it. He will take anything you give him. But he ought to have the first place. [Applause] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Exactly right, brother. &gt;&gt; That feminist spirit &gt;&gt; will keep a woman from appreciating the true marriage covenant &gt;&gt; and what that woman was created for. &gt;&gt; Is the mic on? Did y'all hear that? &gt;&gt; That feminine spirit Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But God created the woman &gt;&gt; to be the help meetat &gt;&gt; to the man. &gt;&gt; Her calling, her purpose, her fulfillment comes in giving unto her man. And as her man succeeds, she succeeds. &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all didn't know that. Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, y'all ever listen to any of the messages. &gt;&gt; How many's ever read in the Bible in in First Corinthians? He makes it very clear. The woman, the man was not made for the woman, but the woman was made for the man. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. and what you do at home and what you're what Hallelujah. Glory. Y'all start smiling at me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But that same spirit that comes into them &gt;&gt; and you start treating your husband, Jesus Christ, the word, &gt;&gt; as though he don't matter. &gt;&gt; You start treating Jesus Christ, the word, as if he's he's just second place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll take it. &gt;&gt; He'll take it. But he ain't going to share his glory with you. &gt;&gt; You can be a wannabe and a halfway all you want to, but God does not make halfway preachers. He does not make halfway Christians. He makes full. He's ordained you to be a believer. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; What does the Lord require of me in these days when the mysteries have been unveiled, the symbols interpreted, the open book, Amen, available to the sons of God. Surely there's some responsibilities that are coming with it. The opening of the seals is not the new form of legalism. The opening of the seals is not a certain code of conduct. The opening of the seals is a bedroom relationship between you and Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham talking about in the choosing of the bride 65. He talks about the two churches. One of them is a denominational birth. &gt;&gt; It's going to going to be given one one day to to the one these days at the World Council of Churches which will produce the the world to the world the antichrist through denomination. And that's exactly the truth. I may not leave to see it. I believe I will. But you young people remember you heard a minister say that that finally that'll finally wind up. That is the mark of the beast when she forms the World Council of Churches. She'll give birth to her son, the Antichrist. But the other is impregnated, too. &gt;&gt; There's a surrendered woman who is impregnated, too. Well, y'all ought to be shouting right now. &gt;&gt; There is a woman on earth, the bride of Jesus Christ, that he wants to impregnate with his word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. All right. &gt;&gt; She's impregnated by the word of God. &gt;&gt; And it will bring forth the body, the finished body of Jesus Christ, which is the bride. The body of Christ alone isn't isn't finished yet. Amen. Uh how how many how many knows that a man and woman is one. Christ is one body. The word the bride will have to be the rest of that body. And you and the two together makes one body again like Adam was at the beginning. Man, his wife are one. Amen. Now she, the true bride, is so sold out to him. Someone shout, "Yes." &gt;&gt; The true bride is so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own. His mind, of course, it's his will and his will is his word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, what is divine worship? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on now. All right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What is divine worship? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's praise with a meaning. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's life &gt;&gt; with a meaning. &gt;&gt; It's going to work &gt;&gt; with a meaning. &gt;&gt; It's serving your husbands &gt;&gt; with a meaning. Everything about you, you are the very bride body of Jesus Christ. He's impregnating you with this. What are we looking to? The coming Oh, God. Amen. The bride body is going to produce the very word Jesus Christ himself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; divine worship would have to know we know where he is. We understand the purpose of his word and we know our placing. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet would put it this way, brother. If you ever amount to anything, you got to love God better than your wife, your husband, your children, your pastor. &gt;&gt; You everything there is. &gt;&gt; You've got to love God first. &gt;&gt; God gets first place. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; So, as we stand here today, Amen. There's a lot of there's a lot of sometimes questions around well do we believe in tongues or do we believe in prophecies and do we believe in I just believe in the bride falling in love with Jesus. &gt;&gt; I believe in Jesus having the perfect way in his church. &gt;&gt; And if Jesus wants to speak in tongues, we'll let him. If Jesus wants to prophesy, we'll let him. If Jesus wants to do those things, we'll let him. But there's one thing that I have found. Amen. I left a long time in Pentecost. Amen. I am not following after signs that Amen. that come and fall. Come and fall. Amen. There's one desire I have and that's for the Lord Jesus Christ to be satisfied with me. I want God to be satisfied with my life. I want to live a humble life that God can call me and anoint me and oh, come on, church. Amen. Death throw everything else aside and say, "God, I just want to fall in love." Is that not what the prophet said? He says it'll do better than all the gifts you ever had. divine love. &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Isaiah 58 and two. &gt;&gt; He says, "Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways. As a nation they did righteous and forsook the not the ordinance of their God. They asked me the ordinance asked of me the ordinances of justice and they take delight in approaching God. Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seeest not. &gt;&gt; Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast, you find pleasure, and exact all your labors. &gt;&gt; Behold, you fast for strife and debate, and smite with a fist of wickedness, and you shall not fast as you do this day to make your voice be heard on high. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Is it such a fast that I've chosen? &gt;&gt; A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bull rush to spin sadcloth and ashes under him? &gt;&gt; Will thou call this a fast an acceptable day of the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; To loose the bands of wickedness, &gt;&gt; to undo the heavy burdens. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; To let the oppressed go free &gt;&gt; and to break every yoke. Come on. &gt;&gt; I Isn't that what God is looking for? Is a body that he can work through. &gt;&gt; A body that he can &gt;&gt; Jesus was the heartbeat of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the heartbeat of God. You look at Jesus and you can see the very pulsation of divine grace and divine love. &gt;&gt; We're the heartbeat of Christ. We're the feminine sight of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Our love, our desire is to serve him, honor him, feed him, praise him. [Music] &gt;&gt; We are his helpmates. &gt;&gt; We are his Oh, come on, church. Help me preach. I I I hope I'm doing all right here tonight. Amen. God, get us back to that point where our hearts are soft and humble and pure before God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Question and answers. &gt;&gt; Is the bride of Christ and the body of Christ the same? Yes, sir. When God gave Adam his bride from his side, &gt;&gt; he said, "She is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone." &gt;&gt; Is that right? When God gave Christ his bride, &gt;&gt; the spirit gave the flesh, the bride and pierced his side under his heart, water, blood, and spirit come forth &gt;&gt; that become the flesh of his flesh, &gt;&gt; the bone of his bone. We are the flesh and bones. The bride will be the flesh and bones of Christ. Flesh, &gt;&gt; brother Sam. The flesh &gt;&gt; and bones &gt;&gt; of that living eternal spirit &gt;&gt; walking in school. &gt;&gt; Flesh and bones. Flesh and bones. Like like Amen. those disciples Peter and John. Amen. They they look at the crippled man. Everyone else had passed by. But here comes something. Amen. Within and they stopped and they said, "Silver and gold have we none, but such as we do have. Come on. &gt;&gt; It was the continuation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was the continuation. What can you say? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the church will come through justification Luther sanctification through Wesley baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man when the husband and the wife will be the selfsame person. God will be so manifested in his bride, his church, till they will both be the same. Someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A surrendered life. There is a responsibility. As my as a husband, I've got a responsibility. My wife has a responsibility. Amen. As the bride of Jesus Christ, I have a responsibility. I'm stepping up to my responsibility and I'm saying, Lord, I want to be everything that you want me to be. &gt;&gt; So they asked, "Will the bride have a ministry?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; The bride will have a ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's what is taking place. through the five-fold ministry. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Is that not a quote? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Truth, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what my desire is? Is Lord, I'm going to yield myself to you. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to have the biggest churches. I don't have to have the best of talents. I don't have to have Lord, if you just give me a revelation of who you are so that I can properly serve you &gt;&gt; because I have found there's been too many people with gifts and callings. There's been too many people, Amen. And all it's done is made them hot shots. &gt;&gt; And then hot shots can't really do too much for the Lord. They're building kingdoms for themselves. They're doing this. They're doing that. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. And we now we can all get there, can't we? God's not interested in what you can bring to the table. He's interested in a body that he can impregnate by his spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say &gt;&gt; it would have to be &gt;&gt; because a woman and her husband become one. &gt;&gt; They become one and so does the bride in Christ become one. The ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same. &gt;&gt; Remember these former treaties, O Theophilles, have I wrote to you that Jesus be to do and continues to do. His death didn't stop him. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he returned again. Not a third person, but the same person returned again in the form of the Holy Spirit to continue his work on and continues on, says the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; What's required of this bride &gt;&gt; in the last days? &gt;&gt; Am I doing all right? &gt;&gt; What's required of this bride? &gt;&gt; This humble bride. &gt;&gt; This bride that God finds no fault in. &gt;&gt; This bride that is just as perfect as Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This bride that he has created. He created his own bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What would you boys do if y'all could create your own bride? &gt;&gt; But you can Jesus created his own bride. &gt;&gt; And everything about her is lovely. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His righteousness is her righteousness. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; His divine character is her divine character. Amen. &gt;&gt; All he wants is for her to look back at him &gt;&gt; and not follow the serpent. &gt;&gt; Not go whoring after other things like the Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But to fall in love with this one who created her. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Question and answer 64. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, "Who is your little queen in the home? She ministers food to you." Is that right? &gt;&gt; He says, "Now the bride ministers Christ the word." &gt;&gt; Man should not live by bread alone, but by every word. Right. &gt;&gt; She ministers the word to the king, &gt;&gt; manifesting his promised word in the age that she's living in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are feeding Christ &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; By manifesting &gt;&gt; the word in our age. How do I feed Christ? Man, if I'm feeding him by taking his word and making it my word. &gt;&gt; Taking his desires and making it my command. &gt;&gt; I am feeding Christ his very own word. That's his favorite supper. &gt;&gt; He loves it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. He She ministers the word to the king &gt;&gt; by manifesting his promised word in the age he's living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said something then you didn't get it. Amen. Notice. Oh my. That was a good one. Ministering in the age the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense here tonight? Absolutely sir. &gt;&gt; They asked brother Brandham they said so so they they said so will everyone cast out devils raise the dead will everyone fulfill he said you have said that that that this has got to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and he says, "Will every true believer do the works that Jesus said?" And in in John 14, uh he says, "The heal the sick, cast out devils, raise the dead." Uh he said, "I don't think that's in John 14, but all right, it's in Mark." But is or is this only to be Elijah? Must the believer do all this? Do do we really that really believe? If he really is a real believer, will he raise the dead and do great miracles? on &gt;&gt; brother was fixing to answer the question. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now they're asking now is this just for you &gt;&gt; or is this required of us all? &gt;&gt; The Bible says in my name they'll cast out devils. &gt;&gt; And if you don't have a revelation &gt;&gt; of who you are and what the bride body is, you'll miss it. Watch this. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now it that is among the believers." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every man doesn't have those gifts. &gt;&gt; And don't mean that just one person will do it. &gt;&gt; There will be groups of people. Like for instance, if we had a little girl in the church or a little boy, somebody that we love real well, and life would go out of them, the whole church would get together and they'd go to fasting and praying. &gt;&gt; That is a &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; That is the bride body feeding Christ his word. &gt;&gt; The whole church would get together and go to praying and fasting. Lord have mercy on that child. God could raise it up. How many ever read the nin fathers and them, you know, that's the way they done it in the early church. They'd all get together, you know, and and and even raise up their pastor sometime and the different ones if God seen fit to do it, but they done it. So, brother Brandham is saying it's not that this one's going to do it and that it's going to be a bride body. Oh, church of the living God. Amen. If we could just understand that all of us peeons matter. We all matter. You matter. You young men matter. You young ladies matter. You elders matter. We all fit into the body of Jesus Christ. And we have that responsibility. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One more quote and then I'm going to I'm going to Amen. Start settling down here. Amen. He said the church is so carnal it feeds itself on worldly cra and &gt;&gt; get things of the world just like the vultures church politics. They don't let the Holy Ghost send a man to the church. They they have to have politics and the denominations is going to receive him or not. Amen. They they're like the world. They dress like the world. They look like the world. They act like the world. They're vultures. They like the world. They're they're lazy and they're soft and they're compromisers. Brother, I don't want to be that. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. He says, "But did you ever see an eagle compromise?" No, sir. There's no compromising in him. Neither does a genuine Christian. He ain't soft. He'll go hunt his food until he finds it. Amen. Yes, sir. He'll find his meat. He wants fresh mana. He'll get down there and dig until he finds it. He'll fly higher and higher. The higher you go, the more you can see. So, it's time for the eagles of this day to get to flying higher and dig into God's promises and not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago. Get out of it politics and voting in and voting out and saying this, that, and the other. Holy Spirit has no more ride away in the church than other. There's no more prayer meetings. There's no more agonizing with God to fulfill his word. There's no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday, today, and forever. But there is a bride. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's a bride that says, "My man can do it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good preacher. &gt;&gt; I love it when my wife brags on me. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I like it when she does it in front of me, but I also like it when she's doing it and she don't know I'm there. &gt;&gt; She's always saying, "Well, I tell you what, Wendle just really she says things that she don't tell me. I'm going [Laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm thinking I'm going to go put some after shave on. Oh, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; She bragging on it. &gt;&gt; All right. There ain't no one there ain't there ain't there there ain't no one could be tore down like a man from his wife by his wife &gt;&gt; and there ain't no one that can be built up &gt;&gt; like a man's wife &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; says I find no fault [Applause] &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ is my my redeemer can do it. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We We had a lady we we've had a lady in our church and and and and brother Sam would would know sister.

And uh but at our at our youth camp when we were having that when they were having that uh prayer line come through, &gt;&gt; well, I noticed she didn't come through and the wonderful prayer line. And uh so she came up afterwards and she says, "Now, Brother Windle, I know you're going to be mad at me cuz I didn't go through the prayer line." And I said, "Yeah, me and you going to talk." She said, "But no, listen. I was holding a baby for them out there, and so I just felt like this is what I needed to do. I was holding a baby for for for someone else." And she said, "But the presence of God came back there in the back anyways." &gt;&gt; Now, Mr. Pastor was saying, "Listen, I don't want to go to no more hospitals. I wanted you in that prayer line." &gt;&gt; Come on. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; She goes the next She goes that next week. She goes that next Monday, she was going weekly for her enzyme shots.

And I know that the devil's trying to come in our church and tell us that God can't do it. But there's going to be somebody that's going to be agonizing in prayer and calling out to God and say, "God, I believe you're true. I believe your word is true. I don't care." Amen. What all the what what all they say. I don't care what the denominations say. I don't care what the unbelievers say. God, I believe your word is true.

We need one another. &gt;&gt; Dear God, it's time for the big shock stuff to be over. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When the prophet of God say, "Amen." He says, "If we look at this watch," he holds his watch up to find out what time it is, unless every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other, we'll never know the correct time. Is that right? And that takes all of us all together. If we want to see that third pull really do something for God, it's the coordination with every one of us together to humble ourselves before God. &gt;&gt; Confess our wrongs and pray and believe God for these things. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.

You need miracles, just just love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just love him. &gt;&gt; Just fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know this might not be a convention &gt;&gt; message, &gt;&gt; but it's a &gt;&gt; What do we want? &gt;&gt; Why did you all come all this way? There's way over a dozen states represented here &gt;&gt; this week. &gt;&gt; Why are you here? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Good brother. &gt;&gt; Love him. &gt;&gt; Let his presence come down upon you.

And son, it'll produce. &gt;&gt; The word will produce. &gt;&gt; Just needing somebody surrendered. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just needing somebody &gt;&gt; that'll own up to their responsibilities. Oh yes, &gt;&gt; I told a young lady the other day, marriage is not for children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Marriage is a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Don't sherk, &gt;&gt; pastors. &gt;&gt; Don't sherk your responsibility. &gt;&gt; Evangelists, don't sherk your responsibility. [Music] This is the final leg. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are the last. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; you young people, don't leave it to your mas and daddies and your youth leaders. It's time for someone to say, "God, I'm going to surrender everything that I've got. Glory to &gt;&gt; I'm going to live my life for you. I'm tired of playing on the fence. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of just giving it halfway. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; David had sinned. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; against God. And a great plague had came out and was killing tens of thousands. There David knew it was his own fault. &gt;&gt; There he was looking at his regrets. And I believe it was the prophet Gad that came up to him and said, "David, you've sinned against the Lord, &gt;&gt; but he's just told me you get up there to the threshing floor of Arana." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you offer a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll meet you there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that David &gt;&gt; He ran &gt;&gt; to the threshing floor of Urana. Arana. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he says and and and Arana sees and he bows and he says, "What can I do for my king?" And he says, "I've come to buy your threshing floor for I want to offer unto the Lord &gt;&gt; that that he is worthy of." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And the Bible says, "Take and I give it to you and I'll give you all the ox and sheep that you need and all of the utensils." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he treated him as one king to another. &gt;&gt; Glor. &gt;&gt; And David says, "I will not offer &gt;&gt; to my God that which I which has cost me nothing." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I will not offer to my God anything &gt;&gt; that doesn't cost me something. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Power. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he bought the threshing floor. &gt;&gt; He bought the oxen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He paid for it all. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He got it all together and he begin to worship the Lord and calling unto the Lord and the Bible says that God met with them &gt;&gt; and the plague was stopped &gt;&gt; the death angel. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; If there's somebody I you might be in there and you might be living, you're living you're being accountable. You're living with &gt;&gt; All right. Come on. &gt;&gt; The junk of your decision &gt;&gt; making &gt;&gt; and maybe it's cost you your children and maybe it's cost you your marriage and maybe it's cost you your walk with God. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. But if you can hear the prophet &gt;&gt; saying that if you'll just surrender to God, you'll come at the altar of his word. &gt;&gt; It's going to take some sacrifice. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to die to yourself. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to give up your pride. You're going to have to give up these things. You've got to come sincerely before God. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to play with you. &gt;&gt; I'm not playing with my salvation. And I sure ain't playing with the salvation of my children. Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Some families are children are are are are doomed because of the &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; sins of the parents. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because mom and dad didn't want to take care of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; What do I do, brother? [Music] &gt;&gt; What does God require of me? Do I give him thousands of rivers of oil? Do I bring 10,000 oxen? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Can I give him my firstborn? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God's just wanting somebody &gt;&gt; will give him their all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God's just wanting somebody. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To say, "I need you more than I need anything else." &gt;&gt; Take me, &gt;&gt; my things.
