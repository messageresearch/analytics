[15:33] rough days, uh, hip and legs. So, we

[16:33] We believe God can heal your body, soul,
[16:35] and spirit. Know we believe it. Amen. If
[16:37] you have a need on your heart tonight, I
[16:39] just wonder if we could just go to the
[16:40] Lord in prayer now and and just ask
[16:42] brother Jared to take these needs before
[16:44] the Lord.
[16:48] Heavenly Father, we come before you

[17:05] to each and every one Lord. Meet each
[17:07] and every need. Lord

[35:04] heads together for just a moment. If
[35:06] you've got a special need tonight, you'd
[35:08] like to make way by make known by
[35:10] uplifted hand. I know he knows your
[35:12] heart and knows your need.
[35:15] Brother Brandham talked about how that
[35:16] made him feel when people raise their
[35:18] hand with a need and said, "If it makes
[35:20] me feel that way, how do you think it
[35:21] makes him feel?" He cares about our
[35:25] needs. So thankful for that tonight.
[35:28] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful,
[35:30] Lord, to be in your house once again
[35:34] in the rush of the week and the
[35:35] busyiness, oh God, and the things that
[35:38] we go through and yet we're able to take
[35:40] the time apart on a Wednesday night,
[35:42] Lord, to worship you. So thankful for
[35:45] that opportunity. I pray you'd bless us
[35:47] tonight, each one, Lord, that raised
[35:49] their hand. I I don't know what the need
[35:51] is, but you know, I pray that you'd meet
[35:54] that need tonight. Oh, God. We know
[35:57] there's some serious needs among us. I
[35:59] pray you'd heal those sick people and
[36:02] Lord, touch their bodies, those that are
[36:04] mourning today. I pray you'd turn their
[36:06] mourning into dancing. Lord, take a
[36:10] Lord, a spirit of joy, a garment of
[36:12] praise for a spirit of heaviness. Pray
[36:14] for you granted today. Oh, we thank you
[36:17] for your love, Lord. Thank you for your
[36:19] goodness. You're always good to us. No
[36:21] matter what we've gone through, we know
[36:22] that you're I'll have all things in your
[36:25] hands. We thank you for that. Pray you
[36:27] bless this service tonight. We commit it
[36:30] to you. We ask it in Jesus' name.

[36:35] Amen. Thank the Lord.
[36:38] Amen. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse
[36:40] four. We'll just read that one verse.
[36:42] We'll be reading down through the uh
[36:45] second chapter of Ephesians down through
[36:46] the first few verses if you want to keep
[36:48] your Bible open to that tonight.
[36:51] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 4
[36:55] says, "But God,"
[36:57] I love this, "who is rich in mercy."
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Rich. Aren't you glad he's not poor
[37:04] tonight?
[37:06] &gt;&gt; He's rich in mercy for his great love
[37:10] wherewith he loved us. The Lord would
[37:14] add his blessing to the word. You may be
[37:15] seated. I want to speak to you on that.
[37:18] the God who is rich in mercy. As we
[37:22] continue our study in the book of
[37:23] Ephesians, Paul begins this second
[37:26] chapter by reminding us of our previous
[37:29] condition. He says verse one, you hath
[37:32] he quickened or made alive who were dead
[37:35] in trespasses and sins. He said, you
[37:38] were dead. Uh we were all dead in
[37:40] trespasses and sins. And Paul, he says
[37:44] it just a little differently, but says
[37:46] the same thing in Colossians. In
[37:47] Colossians 1:21, he says, "You that were
[37:50] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[37:53] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he
[37:58] reconciled
[37:59] &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death."
[38:01] Notice how he reconciled you, how he
[38:04] reconciled me was in the body of his
[38:06] flesh through death to present you holy
[38:09] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[38:13] sight. I love that. Unreprovable in his
[38:16] sight. In other words, a a people that
[38:18] live without rebuke because of what he
[38:22] did for us on Calvary.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; But h how did we get in the state of
[38:26] rebellion? How did we get in a state of
[38:28] uh uh that were of death of trespasses
[38:32] and sins? We got in that state naturally
[38:34] in Psalms 51 and verse 5. He said,
[38:37] "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in
[38:40] sin did my mother conceive me." So, we
[38:43] come into the world speaking lies. We
[38:46] come into the world with a fallen
[38:49] nature. We were born dead. In Adam, all
[38:52] die. But aren't you glad tonight that in
[38:54] Christ all are made alive. And I'm glad
[38:57] to be made alive in Christ. We were each
[39:00] one born dead. Our our spirit, our
[39:05] nature, our spiritual nature was still
[39:07] born. We did not know who we were. But
[39:11] but by his grace now we do know who we
[39:13] are and and we know that we belong to
[39:16] God.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; What are the attributes of spiritual
[39:19] death in Ephesians chapter 2 again in
[39:21] verse two he said wherein in time past
[39:24] you walked according to the course of
[39:26] this world
[39:28] according to the prince of the power of
[39:30] the air the spirit that now workketh in
[39:33] the children of disobedience. That word
[39:36] disobedience is unbelief which opposes
[39:39] the gracious word and purpose of God. So
[39:42] we were children of unbelief. What does
[39:45] that make us now? Children of faith.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Children of unbelief. Became children of
[39:50] faith. But he said in time past we
[39:53] walked according to the course of this
[39:55] world. In other words, you walked
[39:57] according to the age that you were
[39:59] living in. So if the other people did
[40:01] drugs, you did drugs. If if the spirit
[40:04] of the age was to lie and to steal and
[40:06] and to commit adultery, that's what you
[40:08] did. That's what I did. But but but now
[40:11] he said you are you become the children
[40:14] of God. And but you did walk according
[40:16] to the age that you were living in. 1
[40:18] Corinthians 6:9, Paul describes the way
[40:22] the age is. He said, "Know ye not that
[40:24] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[40:26] kingdom of God?" He said, "Be not
[40:28] deceived, neither fornicators, nor
[40:30] idolattors, nor adulterers, nor
[40:33] effeminate, that's those that are
[40:35] homosexual, nor abusers of themselves
[40:38] with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous,
[40:41] nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
[40:44] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[40:46] of God." He's saying, "Somebody like
[40:48] that that does that is not going to come
[40:51] into the kingdom of God." He says, "And
[40:53] such were some of you." Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; I don't we may not want to admit what
[41:01] particular part of that we fulfilled,
[41:03] but such were some of you. But God rich
[41:07] in mercy.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; But you are washed. But you are
[41:12] sanctified. But you are justified in the
[41:14] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[41:16] of our God. He's saying this is what you
[41:18] were. This is not what YOU ARE. WE DON'T
[41:21] believe in a gospel that leaves you the
[41:22] way that you are. We believe in a
[41:24] POWERFUL GOSPEL, THE POWER OF GOD into
[41:27] salvation that changes you from what you
[41:29] were to what you are in Christ. DON'T
[41:32] CONTINUE TO WALK THE WAY you've walked.
[41:33] HE SAID, "IN TIME PAST, YOU WALKED THAT
[41:35] WAY, BUT NOW YOU WALK DIFFERENTLY
[41:37] BECAUSE mercy has gotten a hold of your
[41:40] life."
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Every one of us were bound for
[41:43] destruction. He says in verse three,
[41:45] Ephesians 2:3, he said, "Among whom also
[41:48] we all had our conversation, our
[41:51] lifestyle in times past in the lust of
[41:53] our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the
[41:56] flesh and of the mind, and were by
[41:59] nature the children of wrath, even as
[42:03] others." You were by nature the children
[42:06] of wrath, even as others, you were bound
[42:08] for destruction. We were bound for
[42:11] destruction. But verse four, but God who
[42:14] is rich in mercy,
[42:16] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he had enough in the bank
[42:18] account. He had enough MERCY TO REACH
[42:20] DOWN WHERE I WAS, BROTHER JT, ENOUGH
[42:22] MERCY TO REACH DOWN FOR BROTHER PAUL, to
[42:24] reach DOWN FOR BROTHER HARVEY, TO REACH
[42:26] DOWN FOR SISTER ANNA AND EACH ONE OF YOU
[42:28] HERE TONIGHT. HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY TO
[42:31] REACH DOWN FOR YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK
[42:32] HIM FOR THAT TONIGHT. I WANT TO THANK
[42:34] HIM for his mercy and his love in my
[42:36] life.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; His mercy was a result of his great
[42:39] love. He said, "God who is rich in
[42:42] mercy, for his great love wherewith he
[42:45] loved us for his great love, HIS
[42:48] ATTRIBUTE OF MERCY FULFILLS HIS
[42:50] attribute of love." You realize that God
[42:52] being GOD, HE HAS TO be everything that
[42:54] he is,
[42:55] &gt;&gt; right? God will never impersonate
[42:57] HIMSELF. HE WILL NEVER BE SOMETHING
[42:59] DIFFERENT than what he is. But if he IS
[43:01] LOVE, HE WILL ALWAYS be love.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; IF HE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS, HE WILL ALWAYS
[43:05] BE RIGHTEOUSNESS. Oh my, he's if he's
[43:08] just, he will always be just. And so to
[43:11] fulfill his his uh his attribute of
[43:14] righteousness and of justice, he had to
[43:17] die for our sins. Aren't you glad that
[43:18] he did?
[43:20] &gt;&gt; But it was his attribute of of love that
[43:23] produced his attribute of mercy.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; His attribute OF MERCY FULFILLS HIS
[43:28] attribute of love. Verse 5, even when we
[43:31] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[43:33] together with Christ by grace you are
[43:36] saved. We are quickened in his
[43:38] resurrection. Brother said it's the
[43:39] greatest thing that could happen to a
[43:41] person is to be quickened to be made
[43:44] alive from the dead. It's that word
[43:46] quicken is to reanimate conjoinly with
[43:49] to quicken together with. So in other
[43:51] words, we were made alive in his
[43:54] resurrection.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; That's how we were made alive. It's by
[43:57] his resurrection. That's right.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You deserve to
[44:02] be that way." In other words, the
[44:03] children of wrath because you was a
[44:06] sinner, but God who is rich in mercy.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. And I'm just going to
[44:11] pull some thoughts tonight from that
[44:13] that sermon, but God who's rich in
[44:14] mercy. Some of you heard it before the
[44:16] service. So, some of the things will be
[44:18] familiar to you tonight. But I believe
[44:20] it was a masterpiece. I believe God had
[44:22] a prophet preach it for a reason.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "You deserve to be that way
[44:26] because you was a sinner. But God who is
[44:28] rich in mercy. That's the thing. God who
[44:30] was rich. All these things that we were
[44:32] but God that made the change right
[44:34] there. God who was rich in mercy. He
[44:37] said, "Oh, I'm so glad for that. That he
[44:39] being rich in mercy. If he was just rich
[44:41] in money, if he was just rich in
[44:43] materials, which he is, BUT YET THE
[44:45] GREATEST thing is being rich in mercy.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen, you don't have to worry
[44:49] about God being too poor to be able to
[44:51] help you." Come on.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Right. You know, if you were coming to a
[44:55] rich man, if you were coming to me and
[44:56] asking me for $10,000, you wouldn't have
[44:58] much confidence you would get it.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. I know some of you say, "Well,
[45:04] Brother Ben, don't have that kind of
[45:05] money, you know." But but if we were
[45:07] asking a rich man, we would believe that
[45:09] a man who was rich had the ability TO
[45:12] GIVE IT TO US.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen to me. If we we would
[45:16] believe that Elon Musk would have the
[45:18] ability to give away money because
[45:20] what's $1,000 to Elon Musk? What's
[45:22] 10,000? What's a million? What's a
[45:24] billion dollars? Right? IF IF HE LOST 10
[45:27] BILLION DOLLARS TODAY, IT WOULDN'T mean
[45:28] nothing to him. YOU REALIZE WHEN GOD
[45:31] SAVED YOU, HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY to save
[45:33] you FROM ALL OF YOUR SIN AND TO SAVE THE
[45:36] EVERY SEED OF GOD THAT HE EVER HAD IN
[45:38] HIS MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[45:40] WORLD. HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY. LISTEN, IT
[45:42] DON'T MATTER HOW DARK YOUR LIFE WAS, HOW
[45:45] FAR AWAY WE WERE, HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY TO
[45:47] SAVE YOU. BUT HE DIDN'T STOP THERE. HIS
[45:49] MERCY EXTENDED EVEN TO YOUR NATURAL BODY
[45:52] AND HIS HIS ATONEMENT TOOK CARE NOT ONLY
[45:54] OF SALVATION but also of healing.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; So his MERCY NOT ONLY SAVED YOU BUT HIS
[46:00] MERCY HEALED YOU.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[46:02] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU glad for his mercy mercy
[46:04] today?
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Mercy is compassion.
[46:08] But Brandon said if he was just rich in
[46:10] money, if he was just rich in materials,
[46:12] which he is, yet the greatest thing is
[46:14] being rich in mercy.
[46:17] He in Romans 9:15, he said to Moses, "I
[46:19] will have mercy on whom I will have
[46:22] mercy. I will have compassion on whom I
[46:25] will have compassion."
[46:27] &gt;&gt; So then, it is not of him that willth,
[46:29] nor of him that runth, but of God that
[46:32] showeth mercy.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; So if he had mercy on you to quicken you
[46:36] to the word, and brother Brandon brings
[46:37] that out, and the God who was rich in
[46:39] mercy, there must have been a seed there
[46:41] somewhere.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; So I think you can have confidence in
[46:44] that today. I know sometimes we wonder,
[46:46] well, am I a seed of God? I wonder if I
[46:48] really am. I wonder I wonder if I really
[46:50] uh if I if you know, maybe I just agreed
[46:53] with the message. Maybe I'm just
[46:54] impersonating a believer. Maybe I'm a an
[46:57] Esau. Maybe I'm a a Cain. But listen to
[47:00] me. If he showed you mercy,
[47:04] &gt;&gt; are you with me now?
[47:05] &gt;&gt; To quicken you to the word, IF YOU'VE
[47:07] BEEN QUICKENED TO THE WORD, MADE ALIVE
[47:09] TO THE WORD IN YOUR HEART, there had to
[47:12] be a seed there somewhere. Come on.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Because a a a person, a Cain or an Esau,
[47:18] they might assimilate with the word, but
[47:20] they could never be quickened to it.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; But if you were quickened to it, no
[47:24] matter WHAT HOW HOW MANY STRUGGLES YOU
[47:26] MIGHT HAVE, NO MA NO MATTER HOW HARD
[47:28] YOUR LIFE WAS, NO MATTER how many
[47:29] difficulties you might have in life, IF
[47:31] YOU'VE BEEN QUICKENED TO THE WORD, you
[47:32] are a SEED OF GOD.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NONSEED cannot be quickened.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me tonight. That
[47:39] ought to cast out every devil of doubt,
[47:41] every demon that tries to tell you,
[47:42] "Well, I'm not a believer." I I remember
[47:46] early on in my life that that was
[47:48] messing with me a little bit in my mind
[47:49] because my father told me because he I
[47:52] disagreed with him on something and he
[47:54] told me he said, "You're you're not
[47:56] predestined." And and that that gave me
[47:59] a complex for a while. And I struggled
[48:00] with that when I would hear preaching
[48:02] about predestination. Maybe I'm not a
[48:04] maybe I'm not predestined. MAYBE I'M NOT
[48:06] a feat of God. BUT IT WAS HIM THAT
[48:08] QUICKENED ME. IF I WASN'T THE SEED OF
[48:10] GOD, I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MADE ALIVE TO
[48:12] the word.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME TODAY? IN SPITE OF MY
[48:16] BETTER JUDGMENT, IN SPITE OF WHAT I
[48:17] WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE, I'M HERE
[48:19] TODAY BY THE GRACE OF GOD. PAUL SAYS, BY
[48:21] THE GRACE OF GOD, I AM WHAT I AM.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; SO, IF HE HADN'T QUICKENED ME, I HAD TO
[48:26] BE A SEAT OF GOD OR HE would have never
[48:28] quickened me. He could have never
[48:29] quickened me. There would be no life
[48:30] there.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said, you couldn't have
[48:33] even been born in this world without the
[48:34] fornowledge of God. Right?
[48:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "And when that little baby is
[48:38] born into the world, THERE IS SOMETHING
[48:39] IN THAT BABY. IF HE'S EVER GOING TO HAVE
[48:41] LIFE, THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING IN
[48:43] THERE IN THAT CHILD THEN THAT HE COMES
[48:45] TO SOONER OR LATER. OH, FOR SOME IT WAS
[48:47] SOONER. FOR SOME IT WAS LATER, BUT
[48:49] SOONER OR LATER HE'LL COME TO IT."
[48:51] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; A little seed is in him. Again, he said,
[48:54] "Now we're a part OF GOD. YOU ALWAYS
[48:56] WAS. YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT BECAUSE you
[48:57] were only an attribute in God. You were
[48:59] only in his thinking. Your very name, if
[49:01] it ever was on the book of life, it was
[49:03] put THERE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the
[49:04] world. He knew what you were. He said,
[49:07] "I'm only saying this NOT TO MIX UP
[49:09] DOCTRINE, BUT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT THAT
[49:11] WE MIGHT GET AWAY from this fear and
[49:13] scare." WAS IT DURING THE PENTECOSTAL
[49:15] AGE, during the holiness age, PEOPLE
[49:17] COULD PUT YOU IN, TAKE YOU TAKE YOU OUT
[49:19] OR PUT YOU IN DEPENDING ON how you
[49:21] agreed with the pastor, DEPENDING ON HOW
[49:23] much you agreed with the church OR
[49:25] DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LIVE FROM DAY TO
[49:26] DAY. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM COMES AND HE
[49:28] SAID, "I WANT TO TAKE THIS FEAR AND
[49:29] SCARE AWAY FROM YOU." THE PASTOR didn't
[49:31] give it to you. The pastor can't TAKE IT
[49:32] AWAY. EVEN HOW YOU LIVE. YOU LIVE THE
[49:35] WAY THAT YOU LIVE BECAUSE YOU LOVE GOD.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT LIVING RIGHT THAT MAKES YOU
[49:39] A SEED OF GOD. JACOB WAS A SEED of God.
[49:42] HE SAID, "JACOB HAVE I LOVED."
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Even though he LIVED A MUCH WORSE LIFE
[49:46] THAN ESAU DID, but it was BUT WHEN HE
[49:48] WAS CHANGED, HE WALKED DIFFERENT.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN WE'RE CHANGED, we walk
[49:52] different.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:56] Hallelujah. He said, "I want to get away
[49:57] from this fear and scare. You don't know
[49:58] who you are. You're not going to be. But
[50:01] now, someone say it with me tonight."
[50:02] Now,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; now you're the sons of God.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, you always were the
[50:09] sons of God. For when God had you in his
[50:10] thinking at the beginning, you have to
[50:13] be, listen to this now. We just want to
[50:15] nail this down. Some part of you, your
[50:18] life that's in you now, had to be with
[50:19] God before there. He said, well, when he
[50:23] before he even became material here on
[50:25] earth, before there was anything but
[50:26] God, you were one of his attributes.
[50:30] So just like love, he had to express
[50:32] love. He had to express mercy. He had to
[50:35] express justice. He had to express you.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; You were one of HIS ATTRIBUTES. HE KNEW
[50:42] what your name would be.
[50:44] He knew the color of hair you would
[50:47] have.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; See, God knew brother David White would
[50:50] have white hair.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And he knew that his name would be
[50:53] white.
[50:56] Right? God knew that before the
[50:58] foundational view. Do we really believe
[51:00] that, church? Why do we worry SO MUCH
[51:02] THEN? WHY DO WE LET LITTLE THINGS GET IN
[51:05] between us and the Lord AND AND WE
[51:06] THINK, WELL, MAYBE I'M JUST NOT EVEN A
[51:08] CHRISTIAN. Maybe I shouldn't even serve
[51:09] God. HE KNEW YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[51:11] of time.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWED ALL ABOUT YOU.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, in this sermon is
[51:17] where he says, he said, "Some of you can
[51:19] fellowship with me on this thought." HE
[51:21] SAID, "WHEN we were children and and
[51:22] even when we were growing up, he talked
[51:24] about how there was something in us WAS
[51:26] JUST MADE US DIFFERENT AND WE DIDN'T
[51:27] KNOW WHAT IT WAS. WE WERE STILL SINNERS,
[51:29] BUT THERE WAS ALREADY SOMETHING THERE.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; It just needed to be quickened. He said,
[51:34] "YOU HAD TO DIE TO YOURSELF TO BE
[51:36] QUICKENED TO the word."
[51:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "There was God somewhere, yet
[51:39] you were a sinner." He said, "You
[51:41] remember that? Certainly." NOW, WHAT WAS
[51:43] THAT? THERE WAS THAT little form of life
[51:44] in you then. He said, "You went from
[51:46] church to church trying to find the
[51:48] truth." He said, "BUT WHEN YOU HEAR
[51:49] HEARD THE WORD, you know, you know where
[51:52] you come from. You knew what was the
[51:54] truth. You were always the seed was in
[51:56] you always. The word seeing the word
[51:58] that was in you. This is powerful.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; The word seeing the word that was in
[52:05] you.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Before you were saved.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; God's word said.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You were part of the word.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Right. You were already written in the
[52:19] word. You were a spoken seed word. Word.
[52:22] Seed of God. Yes, sir. So then if the
[52:25] word was in you, the word seen the word
[52:28] that was in you that was before the
[52:30] foundation of the world saw the word and
[52:32] you come to it.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon said it was like that
[52:37] duck. He talked about the eagle and he
[52:38] talked about the duck and some of you
[52:40] heard it on the tape. Brother Brandham
[52:42] said the duck. He said he got he got out
[52:44] there. He said he was just scratching
[52:46] with the chickens. He thought he was a
[52:47] chicken. He said, "BUT ONE DAY HE GOT
[52:50] FAR ENOUGH behind the barn, far enough
[52:53] away from those walls, you know, GOT FAR
[52:56] ENOUGH AWAY from those walls and they
[52:58] were training him to be a chicken and HE
[53:00] CAUGHT A SCENT OF WATER."
[53:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But JT, the winds must have
[53:05] just turned and blew the RIGHT
[53:07] DIRECTION. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS
[53:08] LIKE? YOU MIGHT HAVE WENT TO A MESSAGE
[53:10] CHURCH. YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN GROW UP IN A
[53:12] MESSAGE HOME, BUT YOU JUST THOUGHT YOU
[53:13] WERE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE AND YOU SAID,
[53:15] "I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I'M OLD ENOUGH TO
[53:17] LEAVE." BUT ONE DAY YOU GOT FAR ENOUGH
[53:19] OUT BEHIND THE BARN. MAYBE YOU GOT MAYBE
[53:21] AT CAMP. MAYBE ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
[53:22] MAYBE ON A SUNDAY MORNING. MAYBE IT WAS
[53:24] IT WAS JUST ONE DAY AS YOU GOT OLDER YOU
[53:26] SUDDENLY REALIZED I'M NOT THE SON OF MY
[53:28] PARENTS. I'M A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? YOU CAUGHT THE SIN OF
[53:33] WATER. THE WINDS JUST HAPPENED TO BLOW
[53:34] IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND WHEN THE
[53:36] HOLY GHOST WINDS BLEW, YOU SMELLED THAT.
[53:38] THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. AND
[53:40] THERE'S SOMETHING IN A DUCK, COME ON
[53:42] CHURCH, THAT'S GOT TO SWIM. THERE'S
[53:45] SOMETHING IN A BELIEVER THAT'S GOT TO
[53:46] LIVE RIGHT.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING IN A BELIEVER THAT'S GOT TO
[53:49] COME TO THE WORD.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; A duck is is what he is. He can't help
[53:54] that.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And when it was quickened to him,
[53:58] &gt;&gt; he went quacking.
[54:01] I wish Trip would have brought his duck
[54:03] call out here. He come down the street
[54:05] today quacking. I thought it was a herd
[54:07] of ducks coming through coming through
[54:09] our area cuz Trip had his window down
[54:11] quacking as he come through down through
[54:14] town. We'll probably get complaints
[54:16] about that. But anyway,
[54:19] just said, "How was that herd of ducks?"
[54:20] Didn't you see that coming through?
[54:24] What was it? A duck's going to sound
[54:25] like a duck. He's going to be a duck
[54:27] because it's in him to be a duck.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the way when we're born
[54:31] again, what's in us begins to come out.
[54:33] IT WASN'T EXPRESSED BEFORE BECAUSE we
[54:35] weren't quickened. BUT YOU HATH HE
[54:37] QUICKENED,
[54:39] &gt;&gt; MADE ALIVE.
[54:41] HALLELUJAH.
[54:42] HALLELUJAH. Who were dead in trespasses
[54:44] and sins.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; The Brand said, "When you heard the
[54:46] word, you knew where you come from. The
[54:48] word seen the word that was in you." He
[54:50] said, "And that's the way it is with
[54:51] every born again believer. You can hear
[54:53] all the theology you want to, all the
[54:55] man-made discrepancy, but when that word
[54:57] flashes out there, there's something
[54:58] takes a hold. You come to it."
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at Paul. If if you
[55:04] think you can save yourself, explain
[55:06] Paul,
[55:09] &gt;&gt; right? Paul didn't want God. He didn't
[55:12] want nothing to do with God.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; And he was literally knocked off his
[55:16] high horse
[55:17] &gt;&gt; on the way to the ro on the road to
[55:19] Emmas.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T LOOKING FOR GOD. BUT WHEN HE
[55:23] WHEN HE WAS KNOCKED OFF OF HIS HORSE, HE
[55:24] HAD ENOUGH understanding of THE
[55:26] SCRIPTURES. HE SAW THAT LIGHT AND HE
[55:27] SAID, "LORD, LORD," HE SAID, "WHO ARE
[55:29] YOU?" YEAH.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; AND AND HE SAID he said, "I'm Jesus whom
[55:33] you persecute."
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that was enough for Paul.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO KICK
[55:40] AGAINST the pricks." And he he come to
[55:42] himself and he was led into the city. He
[55:44] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:46] AND BECOME THE APOSTLE TO THE GENTILES.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? HAD PAUL HAD NOTHING TO DO
[55:50] WITH IT? HE SAID, "BY THE GRACE OF GOD,
[55:52] I am what I am."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I WAS ZEALOUS ABOVE ALL MY
[55:55] FELLOWS." He was the number ONE
[55:57] PHARISEE. BUT HE COME TO GOD, GOT A HOLD
[55:59] OF HIM ANYWAY.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that's the same thing
[56:02] the believer is. There's something in
[56:04] him. WHEN HE MEETS GOD FACE TO FACE, HE
[56:06] COMES TO HIMSELF.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; THAT SEED IS IN him and it's quickened.
[56:10] LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE of the prodigal son.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; When did the prodigal son ever stop
[56:14] being a son
[56:16] &gt;&gt; now?
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Now think about it.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; HE LEFT THE father's house,
[56:21] &gt;&gt; but he was still a son.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; He took his inheritance early and
[56:25] squandered HIS LIVING ON EVERYTHING. THE
[56:27] WAY MANY of us did.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Right. Left and went out in the world
[56:31] and DID HIS THING,
[56:32] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS STILL A SON,
[56:35] &gt;&gt; HE STILL BELONGED IN THE FAMILY. HE
[56:38] DIDN'T ACT LIKE IT, BUT he was still a
[56:39] son.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't know it, BUT HE WAS STILL A
[56:42] SON.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; And even he COME UNDER A SERVANT
[56:44] MENTALITY that he he was eating the the
[56:47] if he could have, he would have eaten
[56:48] the husk that come off the corn that the
[56:51] that the hogs ate, but he they couldn't
[56:53] even eat that. And his belly WAS EMPTY.
[56:55] AND HE'S STANDING THERE SAYING, "WELL,
[56:56] even the servants eat better than I do."
[56:59] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'LL JUST BE A SERVANT. I'LL
[57:00] GO BACK AND BE A SERVANT." AND HE BEGINS
[57:02] TO GO BACK. THE BIBLE SAID HE CAME TO
[57:04] HIMSELF.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; HE COMES TO HIMSELF. AND WHEN HE DID, HE
[57:11] REALIZES, HEY, I I I I'M THE SON OF
[57:14] SOMEBODY WHO WHO'S RICH IN MERCY.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. SURELY I CAN BE A SERVANT
[57:19] IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE. AND HE GOES BACK
[57:21] DOWN TO THE FATHER'S HOUSE. LISTEN TO
[57:22] ME, YOUNG PERSON. IF YOU'VE DRIFTED AWAY
[57:24] FROM HIM, OLDER PERSON, IF YOU'VE
[57:26] DRIFTED AWAY FROM HIM TONIGHT, YOU MAY
[57:28] HAVE GONE DOWN A LONG ROAD, BUT REMEMBER
[57:30] THE FATHER IS STILL WAITING.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S STILL THERE. HE DIDN'T LEAVE. He's
[57:34] still there. AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO COME
[57:35] BACK, WHAT DID HE DO? HE GOT TO A PLACE
[57:37] WHEN HE GOT DOWN. WHEN THE FATHER SAW
[57:39] HIM, HE RAN TO HIM. HE SAID, "BRING THE
[57:41] KILL THE FATTED CALF. BRING THE ROBE IN
[57:43] THE RING." WHY? HE WAS STILL A SON.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; He come back said, "I'll just be a
[57:48] servant." And the father said, "No, you
[57:49] won't."
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When did he quit being a
[57:54] son? Never quit being a son.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; He just come to himself. He was
[57:58] quickened.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Them old husk had to become dead to him.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; All his friends had to become dead to
[58:06] him.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; The world had to become dead to him so
[58:08] he could become alive in who he was.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the B said, "Now just think of
[58:14] all that we would have been if it hadn't
[58:16] been for God. But God in his rich mercy,
[58:21] how he has redeemed us tonight.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Where would we have been tonight if it
[58:25] hadn't been for God's rich mercy upon
[58:29] us? See, God is rich in mercy to make a
[58:32] way for his children. I hope I have time
[58:35] to get through this. We've not been very
[58:36] long so far, so I hope I have time. He
[58:40] talked about Noah, how that God made a
[58:42] way when the world was so lost that that
[58:45] God looked out at the world and he said,
[58:46] "I'll just destroy all of it." He said,
[58:49] "But the Bible says Noah found grace in
[58:51] the eyes of the Lord."
[58:53] &gt;&gt; And God come down to Noah and we've
[58:56] talked about that before, how Noah was
[58:58] chosen by God to keep the human race
[59:01] alive so that we would not all be
[59:02] destroyed.
[59:04] And the Bible tells us that it was
[59:06] during that time, what was it? God made
[59:08] a way for his believing children. There
[59:11] wasn't but just a few of them. But God
[59:13] made a way. What was it? God rich in
[59:15] mercy provided an ark.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; And see, God won't lose nothing that's
[59:20] his.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? John chapter 6 and
[59:23] verse 39. This is the father's will
[59:26] which hath sent me that of all which he
[59:29] hath given me, I should lose nothing,
[59:32] but should raise it up again at the last
[59:34] day. Again, JOHN 6:44, "NO MAN can come
[59:39] to me except the Father which has sent
[59:41] me. Draw him." Oh, no wonder the
[59:44] SCRIPTURE SAYS, "DRAW ME AND I WILL RUN
[59:46] AFTER THEE." YOU GOT TO BE DRAWN FIRST,
[59:50] &gt;&gt; then run. Listen. He said, "No man can
[59:52] come to me except the Father which has
[59:53] sent me. Draw him and I will raise him
[59:55] up at the last day." God rich in mercy
[1:00:00] providing a way for his elect to be
[1:00:02] quickened. Not only quickened in the
[1:00:04] earnest as we have been, but quickened
[1:00:06] even in these mortal bodies that our
[1:00:08] bodies will be changed and be like his
[1:00:10] glorious body. He said he made a
[1:00:13] provision for those who wants to be
[1:00:14] redeemed. He made a provision. Now, I
[1:00:17] want you to listen to me tonight because
[1:00:19] I know we have many struggling with and
[1:00:21] their bodies for healing. And it's such
[1:00:23] a such an unbelieving age.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Right. This age that we live in is just
[1:00:28] full of unbelief.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All you have to do is get on the
[1:00:31] internet and you just get smitten with
[1:00:34] it.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Just hits you right in the face.
[1:00:36] Facebook's full of it. And and the
[1:00:39] world's full of it. And and even sadly,
[1:00:41] sometimes you go to Job's Comforters and
[1:00:43] they're full of it. And sometimes you
[1:00:45] CAN'T EVEN FIND CHURCH PEOPLE THAT HAVE
[1:00:47] ANY FAITH. BUT I say, let our faith be
[1:00:49] INCREASED TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD IS STILL
[1:00:51] RICH IN MERCY.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; HE HE'S NO POORER THAN HE EVER WAS. HE'S
[1:00:57] JUST AS RICH AS he ever was.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:00] Look, he he made a provision for those
[1:01:03] who wants to be healed. And then because
[1:01:06] that he did this, it makes him rich in
[1:01:07] mercy as he has always been rich in
[1:01:10] mercy. He said it must be. But he said
[1:01:13] if you refuse this, there's nothing left
[1:01:14] but judgment because sin must be judged.
[1:01:18] So there's a way of mercy. He
[1:01:19] illustrated that by the Red Sea. He
[1:01:21] talked about how that Moses went across
[1:01:23] AND GOD MADE A WAY. There was no way,
[1:01:26] but God made a way. How many of you
[1:01:28] COULD TESTIFY TONIGHT WHEN THERE WAS NO
[1:01:30] WAY? GOD MADE a way,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; right? And that that's the way we
[1:01:33] believe for healing.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HEALING IS NOT ABOUT GOD GIVING
[1:01:36] YOU LITTLE clues and saying, "Well,
[1:01:38] you're going to be healed. You're going
[1:01:39] to be healed." Sometimes he does that
[1:01:40] for us to help our faith. But really,
[1:01:42] what it is is when you face an
[1:01:44] impossible object.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THERE'S NO WAY THEY could come
[1:01:48] through the Red Sea.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; No way. THEY COULDN'T BUILD A BOAT THAT
[1:01:52] WOULD HOLD TWO MILLION PEOPLE.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Cross that water. They had nothing to
[1:01:55] build with. THEY WERE IN A DESERT. HOW
[1:01:57] ARE YOU GOING TO GET ACROSS THE RED SEA?
[1:01:59] GOD LED THEM THERE, by the way. They get
[1:02:02] to AN IMPOSSIBLE PLACE. AND WHEN THEY
[1:02:04] GET THERE, THEY HAVE NO WAY TO CROSS.
[1:02:06] BUT GOD SAID, "I'LL MAKE A WAY."
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; So what does he do? He caused the east
[1:02:09] wind to blow. Brother said it WAS THE
[1:02:11] BREATH OF GOD. God looked at the sea
[1:02:13] with angry eyes and the waves rolled
[1:02:15] back and here GOES PHARAOH AND TWO
[1:02:17] MILLION PEOPLE MARCHING ACROSS THE RED
[1:02:19] SEA. And the Bible says their shoes
[1:02:21] didn't even get muddy. Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD RICH in mercy.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he is?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; We're having a good time tonight.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; AND SO THEY GET ACROSS, BUT HE SAID
[1:02:35] PHARAOH WAS AN IMPERSONATOR.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; So Pharaoh said, "Well, if Moses did it,
[1:02:38] I can do it."
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; So Pharaoh starts over and the same
[1:02:43] water that saved Moses destroyed
[1:02:46] Pharaoh. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM PICKS
[1:02:48] that up and he says, "So many people are
[1:02:49] trying to be in the apostolic age." He
[1:02:51] said, "But they're impersonators." We
[1:02:53] see that all over the place today,
[1:02:55] right? People say, "Well, there's this
[1:02:56] man has healing or this man is Elijah."
[1:02:59] Right? Now, there's a bunch of prophets
[1:03:00] saying they're Elijah.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; It seems like an epidemic of it. But we
[1:03:03] believe God sent Elijah in our day.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Right? But every prophet says that says
[1:03:08] that he's Elijah right now. What is it?
[1:03:10] Impersonators.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham teaches us in God
[1:03:13] who is rich in mercy. He says he he says
[1:03:16] that the apostolic age is for believers
[1:03:18] only. Right.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Because you got to be
[1:03:22] able to look at THE WORD AND FACE UP TO
[1:03:24] THE WORD. THE APOSTOLIC AGE IS NOT FOR
[1:03:26] PHARAOH WHO'S STILL IN EGYPT. BUT THE
[1:03:28] APOSTOLIC AGE, LISTEN, IF THERE'S
[1:03:29] ANYBODY THAT CAN HAVE HEALING, IT OUGHT
[1:03:31] TO BE THE PEOPLE OF GOD. IT OUGHT TO BE
[1:03:32] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; The apostolic age is for believers
[1:03:37] only." He said, "God has made a way rich
[1:03:39] in mercy that his children would not
[1:03:41] perish. He's made a way for them. He's
[1:03:43] made a way for you tonight."
[1:03:46] He said now Pharaoh trying to pursue on.
[1:03:48] He drowned in the very waters that saved
[1:03:50] Moses and his group. Moses didn't drown
[1:03:52] because God is rich in mercy to them who
[1:03:53] are following his provided way. Tonight,
[1:03:56] people who don't believe in divine
[1:03:58] healing, he said, people who don't
[1:03:59] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:00] Ghost, how can they receive anything? HE
[1:04:02] SAID, "BUT GOD IS RICH IN MERCY to those
[1:04:04] who will follow after him, not after a
[1:04:06] creed, but after God."
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; God is the word. It was made flesh and
[1:04:11] dwelt among us now that he might bring
[1:04:13] forth the other attributes of God. And
[1:04:15] when any believer comes to God, he
[1:04:17] becomes God's attribute of his word. I
[1:04:19] hope we can understand this tonight. He
[1:04:21] is used to manifest the word that's
[1:04:23] promised for that day.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; SO GOD WANTS TO EXPRESS SOMETHING in
[1:04:27] Leodysia.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO EXPRESS SOMETHING IN in
[1:04:31] Hardy, Arkansas, and brother Walt Morgan
[1:04:33] and each one of you. HE WANTS TO EXPRESS
[1:04:35] SOMETHING PART OF HIS NATURE, his
[1:04:36] character. So how does he do it? Through
[1:04:39] our lives.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Right? THROUGH OUR LIVES. GOD RICH IN
[1:04:43] MERCY WANTS TO MANIFEST THE WORD THROUGH
[1:04:45] US. THAT'S WHY MANY TIMES HE ALLOWS YOU
[1:04:47] TO GET SICK BECAUSE HE WANTS TO MANIFEST
[1:04:49] healing in your life.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; He said God rich in mercy has never left
[1:04:54] us without a testimony.
[1:04:57] Oh my. Now he begins to explain that. He
[1:05:00] illustrates it with the brass serpent.
[1:05:01] You remember the brass serpent that
[1:05:02] Moses lifted up in the wilderness in the
[1:05:05] book of Numbers. how that there was a
[1:05:07] plague that come on the people because
[1:05:09] of their murmuring and their
[1:05:10] complaining, their unbelief. And a
[1:05:12] plague come on them. It was snakes and
[1:05:14] it went out and it it they bit the
[1:05:17] people.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Make a serpent out of
[1:05:20] brass. Put it on a pole." Right. Brass
[1:05:24] represents judgment. He said, "And if
[1:05:26] the people will look at the serpent,
[1:05:28] they'll live."
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's a strange thing, isn't it? But it
[1:05:32] was a type of Jesus Christ who would die
[1:05:35] AND HIS BODY HE WOULD have sin would be
[1:05:37] judged in his body. Right? So any anyone
[1:05:41] that looked lived brother said they were
[1:05:44] so sick that even Dr. Moses none of them
[1:05:46] could do anything about it. THEY WERE
[1:05:48] DYING BY THE THOUSANDS. BUT GOD RICH IN
[1:05:52] MERCY MADE A WAY OF ESCAPE FOR THOSE WHO
[1:05:54] WOULD BELIEVE HIM.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; He said God is interested in everything.
[1:05:58] Someone say it WITH ME. EVERYTHING. GOD
[1:06:01] IS INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:06:03] WRONG. YOU CAN'T FIND A JOB AND YOU SAY,
[1:06:05] "WELL, GOD DON'T CARE WHETHER I HAVE A
[1:06:06] JOB OR NOT." HE'S INTERESTED in
[1:06:08] everything that's wrong.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Everything that YOU GO THROUGH, YOU'RE
[1:06:12] STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY. YOU'RE
[1:06:13] STRUGGLING WITH YOUR HEALTH. YOU'RE
[1:06:15] STRUGGLING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. YOU'RE
[1:06:16] STRUGGLING MAYBE WITH PEOPLE AROUND YOU.
[1:06:18] GOD IS INTERESTED. MAYBE EVEN IN your
[1:06:20] mind, YOU'RE STRUGGLING. BUT GOD IS
[1:06:22] INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING that's wrong.
[1:06:24] Everything that you anticipate in or
[1:06:26] participate in, EVERY WALK OF LIFE, GOD
[1:06:28] IS INTERESTED IN YOU.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:06:31] HALLELUJAH. Can Can we BELIEVE THAT
[1:06:33] TONIGHT?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; GOD IS INTERESTED IN ME. HE'S INTERESTED
[1:06:37] in you. EVERY WALK OF LIFE, GOD IS
[1:06:40] INTERESTED in you. YOU ARE HIS CHILD AND
[1:06:43] HE'S RICH IN MERCY. HE WANTS TO DO FOR
[1:06:46] YOU.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:52] NOW, God provided a brass serpent. Now,
[1:06:54] brother Brandham teaches us and the God
[1:06:55] is rich in mercy. You go back and listen
[1:06:56] to it. That brass serpent was later
[1:06:58] destroyed because they made an idol out
[1:07:01] of it.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; 2 Kings chapter 18 verse4 is where
[1:07:04] you'll find that. 2 Kings 18:4. But that
[1:07:07] was God's provided way at the time, but
[1:07:11] it became idolatry. But the Brandom
[1:07:13] explains that he said the people sinned
[1:07:14] later by taking this same thing that God
[1:07:16] made an atonement for them. But the
[1:07:18] brass serpent which represented sin
[1:07:20] already judged. They idolized that gift
[1:07:22] and that sinned again. He said God will
[1:07:25] not share his glory with nobody.
[1:07:28] Therefore, we can't have no two, three,
[1:07:29] four gods. There's only one God. He will
[1:07:33] not share his glory with anything else.
[1:07:36] He is God alone. So, as the heathens, he
[1:07:38] said, have many gods. We have the one
[1:07:41] God. He will not share his glory with
[1:07:43] another. You understand that we are
[1:07:46] messiahes. We are miniature gods. The
[1:07:48] prophets were called gods,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; right? But but there's one god,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; right? one object of worship,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; right? We are gods in the sense that we
[1:07:57] are a part of him and but we are not
[1:08:00] worshiped. We don't worship one another.
[1:08:02] We don't worship prophets. We have one
[1:08:04] God and he will not share his glory with
[1:08:07] another. Neither will will he let
[1:08:08] anything be an idol in front of him.
[1:08:11] Even though he had made an atonement for
[1:08:12] the people and it was God's word, it was
[1:08:14] right. But when they become to idolizing
[1:08:16] that, then they got in trouble. Now you
[1:08:19] see how that could get in trouble.
[1:08:20] Listen to how he says He said, "That's
[1:08:22] just the same thing." He said, "I think
[1:08:23] that's happened to our church ages. God
[1:08:25] sent us the message of Martin Luther
[1:08:27] with his message, John Wesley, the
[1:08:28] Pentecostal message, but what did we do
[1:08:30] with it? The very same thing they did
[1:08:32] with that brass serpent. We idolized
[1:08:34] it." Listen, he said, "I belong to this
[1:08:36] and I belong to that." You see, you
[1:08:38] belong to something without the
[1:08:40] sincerity that's connected with genuine
[1:08:42] godly worship of the word.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; I want to say something tonight. You
[1:08:48] know, we could we could do that to the
[1:08:50] message. We could even do that to this
[1:08:51] church,
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; right? You belong to something if we're
[1:08:55] not careful without the sincerity.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; It's connected with genuine godly
[1:08:59] worship of the word.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; I've told you before, you can worship,
[1:09:03] you can be wrong and be sincere, but you
[1:09:06] can't be right and be insincere.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; You've got to be sincere to be right.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; So, you could be a part of something.
[1:09:16] You know, prayer line is a We believe in
[1:09:17] prayer lines. We believe God uses that.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But if you just use it like a
[1:09:23] like a some kind of a say, well, I'll
[1:09:25] just go to the prayer line. Everything
[1:09:26] will be okay. But you're not sincere in
[1:09:28] it.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; You realize what that is? You belong to
[1:09:30] something. Oh, we have prayer lines,
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; right? But you're not participating in
[1:09:34] it. You're not you're you're not sincere
[1:09:37] in it.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; So what IT CAN BECOME AN IDOL
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL ACTUALLY TAKE THAT AWAY
[1:09:42] FROM YOU UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW to use it.
[1:09:44] Right?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Anything can become
[1:09:47] that. A pastor can become that. Yeah,
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; a church can become that.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Right. But but but he he had to destroy
[1:09:54] the idol.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; But he said what happened the Bible,
[1:09:56] we're told he said that the prophet took
[1:09:59] that idol and destroyed it. Hallelujah.
[1:10:01] He said what we need on the scene today
[1:10:03] is a prophet. I believe we had one
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; that will destroy the idol of
[1:10:07] denominations that thinks they're going
[1:10:08] into heaven upon belonging to some creed
[1:10:10] or denomination. LISTEN TO ME, CHURCH.
[1:10:12] YOU'RE NOT GOING INTO HEAVEN BECAUSE
[1:10:14] YOU'RE BAPTIST or you're Methodist or
[1:10:15] you're PENTECOSTAL OR YOU SAY, "I BELONG
[1:10:17] TO THE MESSAGE." You go to heaven
[1:10:18] BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SAVED by the blood
[1:10:20] of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said the prophet took
[1:10:24] that idol and destroy it. He said, "What
[1:10:26] we need is A PROPHET WHO WILL DESTROY
[1:10:28] THE idol denomination. Thinks they're
[1:10:29] going into heaven upon belonging. Some
[1:10:30] creed or denomination needs to be
[1:10:32] destroyed and burn up, throw it away."
[1:10:34] HE SAID, "GOD IS FULL of mercy. He's
[1:10:37] rich in mercy." It's it's actually HIS
[1:10:39] MERCY THAT DESTROYS THE IDOL.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? Because he wants
[1:10:44] you to be sincere. He wants you to
[1:10:46] receive your healing.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; He said in that day that when we would
[1:10:49] have all been in chaos of darkness out
[1:10:51] there, but God rich in mercy has sent US
[1:10:54] THE REAL GENUINE HOLY GHOST WITH HIS OWN
[1:10:57] INTERPRETATION TO IT RIGHT THERE IN THE
[1:10:59] BUILDING EVERY NIGHT. GOD RICH IN HIS
[1:11:01] MERCY. How wonderful we find HIM TO BE.
[1:11:03] DO YOU FIND HIM TO BE wonderful tonight?
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; He talked about Luther and Wesley in
[1:11:08] Pentecost and he said we come into the
[1:11:10] Pentecostal age and the restoration of
[1:11:11] the gifts is a very fine thing. It was
[1:11:14] fine in the age, but we are going beyond
[1:11:15] that now. We're beyond that just as sure
[1:11:17] as there's a world. He said, "We got to
[1:11:19] come beyond this thing because we've
[1:11:20] done the same thing with it they did
[1:11:22] before." So, they made an idol out of
[1:11:24] speaking in tongues.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Right. They made an idol. Some of you
[1:11:28] have experienced that. You know what
[1:11:29] what that is? That well, if you speak in
[1:11:30] tongues, you got it. No matter how you
[1:11:32] live,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; it becomes an idol.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Calvin made an idol out of
[1:11:36] predestination,
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; right? Wesley made an idol out of s
[1:11:40] Wesley didn't, but the people that
[1:11:42] followed him made an idol out of
[1:11:43] sanctification,
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; right? Pentecostals made an idol out of
[1:11:46] the gifts,
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Some message people make an idol out of
[1:11:52] the message.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'LL GO BACK TO THE MESSAGE,
[1:11:55] THE PROPHET DESTROYED THAT THING.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'LL JUST SAY WHAT HE SAID, THERE'S
[1:12:01] NO IDOL THERE.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now? Right?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "God will send somebody who
[1:12:05] will smash that thing, tear it to
[1:12:07] pieces, confirm his word, the full
[1:12:09] word."
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Notice, PRAISE BE TO GOD. HE SAID, "WE
[1:12:11] SEE THAT'S TRUE. GOD RICH in his mercy."
[1:12:13] THEN WHEN THE PROPHET DESTROYED THIS, HE
[1:12:15] SAID it left them without any sign of
[1:12:16] healing of an atonement because their
[1:12:18] idol was destroyed. But God,
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD HE'S STILL RICH IN
[1:12:22] MERCY? EVEN WHEN WE MAKE A MISTAKE, EVEN
[1:12:24] WHEN WE MAKE AN IDOL OUT OF IT, HE SAID
[1:12:26] HE'S STILL RICH IN MERCY.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; He said he made them another one. And
[1:12:29] that next one was the pool of Bethesda.
[1:12:32] Yeah.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; He said he made them another place of
[1:12:34] healing
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; where the angel would come down at a
[1:12:37] certain season. You remember the story?
[1:12:38] And would trouble THE WATER AND THEY
[1:12:41] WOULD SIT AROUND THAT THAT WATER AND
[1:12:43] WAIT for the moving of the water and the
[1:12:44] first one that got in would be healed.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Right. And remember there was a man that
[1:12:49] sat there for for years.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; AND HE'D BEEN UNABLE TO GO DOWN AND he
[1:12:54] could he could walk but he just couldn't
[1:12:55] get there fast enough.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Brandon said he may have had a prostate
[1:12:59] problem or something. He just couldn't
[1:13:00] get to the water fast enough. Oh my. I
[1:13:03] tell you what, in denominations, I
[1:13:05] couldn't get to the water fast enough.
[1:13:07] IT WAS A DISAPPOINTING SYSTEM. IT GOD
[1:13:10] USED IT FOR A WHILE. GOD USED THE
[1:13:12] SERPENT on a pole. He used the pool of
[1:13:14] Bethesda.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; It was a It WAS A PROVISION OF MERCY.
[1:13:18] There was a time brother said the
[1:13:20] Nazarene church was a wonderful little
[1:13:22] MOVE OF GOD THAT GOD STARTED, RIGHT? And
[1:13:25] those CHURCHES WERE STARTED BY GOD. GOD
[1:13:27] USED IT, but it become an idol to the
[1:13:29] people. BUT JESUS WALKED AROUND THAT
[1:13:31] POOL of disappointment.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. HE WALKED AMONG ALL
[1:13:34] THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE DISAPPOINTED
[1:13:36] BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET INTO THE
[1:13:37] WATER. AND THE WORD WALKED RIGHT AMONG
[1:13:39] THEM AND COME TO THE ELECT.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO BE WELL?" DO
[1:13:44] YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN THE
[1:13:45] WORD COME BY YOUR WAY AND SAID, "DO YOU
[1:13:47] WANT TO BE WELL?" AND YOU SAID, "YES,
[1:13:48] LORD, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW." HE SAID,
[1:13:50] "JUST LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY. HEAR THE
[1:13:52] WORD AND BE WELL."
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] Hallelujah. See, God rich in mercy, he
[1:14:02] said, although they idolized that thing,
[1:14:04] although the prophet had to tear it up,
[1:14:05] God made another way for them because
[1:14:07] he's rich in mercy, he wants them to be
[1:14:09] healed, and he made a way for their
[1:14:10] healing. And so, he he goes on to say
[1:14:13] that the perfect atonement was Jesus
[1:14:15] Christ. Sin was judged IN HIS BODY. HE
[1:14:18] WAS THE ANGEL that troubled the waters.
[1:14:21] He said, "But then God, rich in mercy,
[1:14:23] sent forth the savior, Jesus Christ. He
[1:14:25] sent forth Jesus to be both savior and
[1:14:27] healer. Both the BRASS SERPENT AND THE
[1:14:29] POOL OF
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; BETHESDA.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; He said he sent him to be savior and
[1:14:35] healer. For he said as Moses lifted up
[1:14:36] the brass serpent in the wilderness, so
[1:14:38] must the son of man be lifted up for the
[1:14:40] same purpose. He said he THE ATONEMENT.
[1:14:43] THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE CLAIM UPON. NOTHING
[1:14:45] BUT THE ATONEMENT. What Jesus purchased
[1:14:47] by his blood. That's what we have claims
[1:14:49] upon. So in other words, that's what we
[1:14:50] can ask for and receive is what he
[1:14:52] purchased. What does the Bible say? He
[1:14:55] was wounded
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; for our transgressions.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; HE WAS BRUISED FOR OUR INIQUITIES. WE
[1:15:01] HAVE A CLAIM ON THAT.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; AND BY HIS STRIPES, SOMEONE SAY IT WITH
[1:15:06] ME. BY HIS STRIPES, I am healed.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Do we really believe that? The perfect
[1:15:13] atonement.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; If he saved YOU, IF HE'S AN ATONEMENT
[1:15:15] FOR YOUR SALVATION, HE'S ALSO AN
[1:15:17] ATONEMENT FOR YOUR HEALING.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; GOD RICH in mercy,
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; didn't leave us. Listen, he didn't ever
[1:15:24] say, "Well, you'll have the word, but no
[1:15:25] spirit. You'll you'll have the the
[1:15:28] theology, but you won't have any way to
[1:15:29] receive YOUR HEALING." NO, HE DID NOT
[1:15:31] LEAVE US WITHOUT A way for healing.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was an eternal atonement.
[1:15:39] He said he this has to be this was to be
[1:15:41] an eternal atonement because he came
[1:15:43] himself. God came in the form of sinful
[1:15:46] flesh to make an eternal atonement and
[1:15:48] suffered in the flesh and made the
[1:15:49] atonement and returned back in the form
[1:15:51] of the Holy Ghost to confirm that
[1:15:53] atonement.
[1:15:55] He said where no brass SERPENT OR NO
[1:15:57] TROUBLED WATER COULD DO IT. HE SAID IT
[1:16:00] ALL POINTED TO THE PERFECT ATONEMENT.
[1:16:02] God rich in his mercy has did this.
[1:16:05] Denomination come along and unbelief
[1:16:07] increased and the atonement WAS OBSCURED
[1:16:09] BY A VEIL OF TRADITION. BUT GOD RICH IN
[1:16:12] MERCY RENT THE VEIL WHEN THE MIGHTY GOD
[1:16:15] CAME IN PLAIN VIEW.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me today? The fullness
[1:16:19] OF THE WORD CAME IN PLAIN VIEW THERE ON
[1:16:21] CALVARY. AND IN THIS DAY, THE FULLNESS
[1:16:23] OF THE WORD CAME IN PLAIN VIEW. What did
[1:16:26] it do? WHAT DID GOD DO? HE SENT A
[1:16:28] MESSAGE. GOD RICH IN MERCY. The message
[1:16:31] ISN'T A DRUDGERY. IT'S NOT A BOOK OF
[1:16:32] RULES, BUT GOD RICH IN MERCY.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE LOVE IT. THAT'S WHY I'M
[1:16:37] NOT AFRAID TO MENTION THE NAME OF
[1:16:38] BROTHER BRANDHAM. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT
[1:16:39] AFRAID TO DO THAT'S WHY I'M NOT AFRAID
[1:16:41] TO BELIEVE IN A PROPHET. IT'S WHY I'M
[1:16:42] NOT AFRAID TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. IT'S
[1:16:44] WHY I'M NOT AFRAID TO READ QUOTES FROM
[1:16:45] THE PULPIT. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT
[1:16:47] AFRAID TO DO WHAT A PROPHET SAID. I'M
[1:16:50] NOT AFRAID BECAUSE HE WAS A WORD
[1:16:51] PROPHET. HE TOOK US BACK TO THE
[1:16:53] SCRIPTURES. GOD RICH IN MERCY PROVIDED A
[1:16:56] WAY.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT WHAT THE DENOMINATION'S
[1:17:00] GOT. I don't WANT TO GO BACK. I WAS A
[1:17:03] DUCK. I WAS MADE TO SWIM.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WAS AN EAGLE. I WAS MADE
[1:17:09] TO FLY.
[1:17:11] Are you with me now?
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; What did the message do? He said the
[1:17:16] messenger, he said Malachi 4, Revelation
[1:17:19] 10:7, he said, "Say, behold the lamb of
[1:17:22] God who takes AWAY THE SIN OF THE
[1:17:24] WORLD."
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; I wish we'd become so familiar with it
[1:17:27] that we could quote it.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:17:31] the sin of the world.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; OH, HE SAID, "NOT BEHOLD MY METHODIST,
[1:17:35] MY BAPTIST, MY PENTECOSTAL, BUT BEHOLD
[1:17:37] THE LAMB." YEAH.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? THE MESSAGE POINTING US
[1:17:40] AWAY FROM A POOL OF BETHESDA, AWAY FROM
[1:17:42] A BRASS SERPENT DESTROYING THOSE IDOLS
[1:17:44] AND SAYING, "HERE IS THE PERFECT
[1:17:46] ATONEMENT. HERE IS THE FULL WORD." DO
[1:17:48] YOU BELIEVE IT TONIGHT? EVERYTHING YOU
[1:17:50] HAVE NEED OF IS RIGHT HERE IN THE WORD
[1:17:51] OF GOD. EVERYTHING THE WORD HAS BEEN
[1:17:54] OPEN TO US IN THIS DAY. And we believe
[1:17:56] that word. If he said, "I'M HEALED,"
[1:17:58] THEN I'M HEALED AND I'M GOING to believe
[1:18:00] it.
[1:18:02] He was talking to a sister there after
[1:18:04] the prayer line and God and um and then
[1:18:07] God was rich in mercy and he told her he
[1:18:10] said you've been trying to believe. He
[1:18:11] said but you got to quit trying to
[1:18:12] believe. Just do it.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Just believe.
[1:18:17] He said it either is or it isn't.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; It's either the truth or it's a false.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And if it's the truth, you're healed.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. YOU'RE ALREADY HEALED.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; I believe it's the truth.
[1:18:32] Hallelujah. What did he do? He said,
[1:18:34] "Lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:18:36] curse, behold, I send Elijah the prophet
[1:18:38] before the coming of the great and
[1:18:39] dreadful day of the Lord, God rich in
[1:18:42] mercy."
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What does the message do as
[1:18:47] we're closing? It points to that perfect
[1:18:50] atonement,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; right? That that that new and Old
[1:18:54] Testament come together. That that open
[1:18:56] book, that that two-winged eagle. Are
[1:19:00] you with me now?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; That perfect atonement, that that one
[1:19:03] who CAN HEAL YOU AND save you. That one
[1:19:06] who's here today to do it. He's bringing
[1:19:09] us back. What does Ephesians chapter 2
[1:19:10] says? We'll read the next two verses.
[1:19:12] Ephesians 2:6. And hath raised us up
[1:19:15] together. God rich in mercy hath raised
[1:19:19] us up together, made us sit together in
[1:19:22] heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in
[1:19:24] the ages to come, he might show the
[1:19:26] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:19:28] kindness toward us THROUGH CHRIST JESUS.
[1:19:30] WHAT WAS IT? GOD RICH IN MERCY, BRINGING
[1:19:33] US BACK TO HIS PERFECT ATONEMENT.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; I was listening to that sermon as I was
[1:19:38] preparing for this as it was just fell
[1:19:39] in line with our what we had to deal
[1:19:42] with tonight. And I I'm listening to
[1:19:44] that and I just kept listening over and
[1:19:46] over to a spot on that tape towards the
[1:19:48] end where he says and I played it before
[1:19:50] church
[1:19:52] spot on the tape where he says some of
[1:19:54] you have heart trouble the doctors can't
[1:19:55] do anything about. He said but God rich
[1:19:58] in mercy.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; He said that same God is here tonight.
[1:20:00] He said some of you have cancer the
[1:20:02] doctors can't do anything about but God
[1:20:03] rich in mercy. Some of you heard that
[1:20:05] before THE SERVICE. HE'S STILL RICH IN
[1:20:07] mercy tonight.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:11] God provided Elijah to call us back to a
[1:20:13] perfect atonement. Healing is here.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; That's not just a song. That's a
[1:20:17] reality.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH COME AND TEAR DOWN THE IDOLS OF
[1:20:21] BAAL and rebuild the altar of God.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; So we could have a perfect atonement.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't come to give us
[1:20:31] another idol. He come to point us to the
[1:20:34] one who could make our hearts right.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to turn our hearts back to
[1:20:40] the perfect
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; atonement musicians, if you would come.
[1:20:44] I I just it just thrilled my heart. And
[1:20:47] I know we have some in need of healing,
[1:20:49] but I needed healing, too. He healed my
[1:20:52] soul.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; That was the perfect atonement that did
[1:20:56] that. The full word did that. I don't
[1:20:58] believe anything else can do that in
[1:20:59] this age. I don't You can run around,
[1:21:02] people go different places and say,
[1:21:03] "Well, I'll try this church and that
[1:21:04] church." But if you're an eagle, there's
[1:21:07] one thing that can heal your soul.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; And there's something missing. As long
[1:21:11] as you're running from place to place
[1:21:12] and and pillar to post, there's
[1:21:15] something missing. But one day, if you
[1:21:16] could ever get the smell of water,
[1:21:19] hallelujah. The Bible said that seed
[1:21:21] await in the earth, it'll sit there. BUT
[1:21:23] THROUGH THE SIN OF WATER, IT'LL bud come
[1:21:27] forth. Oh, Elijah the prophet restored
[1:21:30] back
[1:21:31] a perfect atonement.
[1:21:34] So we could lay our hands on it as
[1:21:35] brother Joel preached Sunday night. We
[1:21:37] could identify with it.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And we're not just talking about
[1:21:40] something that happened 2,000 years ago,
[1:21:43] but a GOD THAT WAS ALIVE TODAY. WHAT WAS
[1:21:45] IT THAT HE SHOWED US? THE SIGN OF THE
[1:21:47] RESURRECTION THAT HE WAS STILL ALIVE.
[1:21:49] HE'S STILL THE SAME God as he always
[1:21:52] was. Do you believe it tonight? Amen.
[1:21:55] Could we stand together? Why don't you
[1:21:57] just claim your healing tonight? If you
[1:21:59] have a need, just lift your hands to
[1:22:01] him. We've sang this before, but let's
[1:22:03] sing it again. And let's just claim it
[1:22:05] tonight. Healing is here. THE ATONEMENT
[1:22:07] HAS BEEN PERFECTED in this hour. WE WE

[1:22:11] THERE. HE DIED FOR US ON THE CROSS. OUR
[1:22:13] HEALING WAS PAID, BUT HE SHOWED US THE
[1:22:15] WAY BACK TO IT. OH MY. HE took away all
[1:22:18] the veil of creeds and denominations and
[1:22:21] showed us a perfect word. I'm so
[1:22:23] grateful for it today. I'm so grateful
[1:22:25] for it. IF IT HEALED YOUR SOUL, HE'S
