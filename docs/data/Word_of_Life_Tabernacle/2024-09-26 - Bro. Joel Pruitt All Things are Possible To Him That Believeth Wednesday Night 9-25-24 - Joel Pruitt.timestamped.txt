[43:42] amen so just keep those services in
[43:43] prayer but if you have your Bibles James
[43:45] chapter 2 verse 19 James chapter
[43:48] 2 and verse
[43:54] 19 say Amen when you get it amen
[43:58] amen thou believest that there is one
[44:01] God thou doest well the Devils also
[44:05] believe and tremble and if you go to
[44:07] Mark chapter 19 and we'll start with
[44:10] verse
[44:11] 17 Mark chapter 19 and
[44:15] 17 and one of the multitudes answered
[44:18] and said master I have brought unto thee
[44:20] my son which hath a dumb spirit and
[44:23] wheresoever he taketh him he teth him
[44:26] and he foth and eth with his teeth and
[44:28] pineth away and I spake to thy disciples
[44:32] that they should cast him out and they
[44:34] could not he anth him and saith oh
[44:37] faithless generation how long shall I be
[44:40] with you how long shall I suffer you
[44:42] bring him unto me and they brought him
[44:44] unto him and when he saw him straightway
[44:47] the spirit tear him and he fell on the
[44:48] ground and wallowed foaming and he asked
[44:51] his father how long is it ago since this
[44:54] came unto him and he said of a child and
[44:57] often times it hath cast him into the
[44:58] fire and into the waters to destroy him
[45:00] but if thou cast do anything have
[45:02] compassion on us and help us and Jesus
[45:05] saith unto them unto him if thou cast
[45:07] believe all things are possible to him
[45:12] that believeth you may be seated may the
[45:13] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[45:16] the word
[45:17] tonight I want you to notice there on
[45:19] the first scripture that the devil
[45:21] actually believes but he trembles at the
[45:25] word of God can you say Amen and so then
[45:27] in Mark Jesus makes a statement if thou
[45:30] can't believe all things are possible so
[45:32] you'll find there is two different types
[45:33] of believing when you say you're you say
[45:35] I believe the message that's good you
[45:37] say I believe in I I believe that I'm
[45:39] going to get home tonight that's good
[45:41] but it's easier to say that when you
[45:42] have a pocket full of money and it's a
[45:44] lot harder to have faith when you don't
[45:46] have any money and but you've got to
[45:48] believe from your heart you've got to
[45:50] believe there's got to be a faith that
[45:51] is a deep settled uh Faith from the
[45:53] heart it can't just be a an intellectual
[45:55] Faith because intellectual Faith might
[45:57] tell you when everything's going right
[45:59] yes I believe when intellectual faith
[46:01] will tell you you know hey everything's
[46:03] going great in my house because I've got
[46:04] a good job and a nice car and and we're
[46:07] able to go to church and and we've got
[46:08] the money to go to church but when when
[46:10] when you go through a challenge are you
[46:11] still able to go are you still able to
[46:13] or you know there's all kinds of
[46:15] challenges that can hit you it can be
[46:16] Health it can be it can be a job it can
[46:19] be it can be your kids maybe they
[46:20] backslide but even in those moments can
[46:23] you still reach down deep and find a
[46:25] faith that is a sustaining Faith Can you
[46:27] say Amen tonight amen and uh in in James
[46:31] uh chapter James chapter 2 and verse 17
[46:35] uh he's talking about faith with faith
[46:37] without works is dead and he goes on
[46:38] down in the 17th verse and says even so
[46:40] faith if it hath not works is dead being
[46:43] alone so your faith will have an action
[46:45] can you say Amen faith will have an
[46:47] action and so the devil believes but the
[46:49] devil doesn't act on his faith the devil
[46:51] believes I mean he believes every word
[46:53] of the message he believes every word of
[46:55] the Bible he knows it's true because
[46:57] he's been cast down the devil knows how
[46:59] the devil believes better than anybody
[47:00] in the building tonight but there's one
[47:02] thing he cannot do and that's act on the
[47:04] word of God can you say Amen so tonight
[47:07] what we're doing is we're not just
[47:08] trying to find an intellectual faith and
[47:10] you walk out of here and it's a health
[47:11] wealth and prosperity message that says
[47:13] well you know what I'm going to have
[47:14] money in the bank my bills are going to
[47:15] be paid all these things are going to be
[47:17] great but what you've got to do is when
[47:19] it's going bad when the bad times are
[47:21] coming well come on somebody when you
[47:23] can't pay your bills and it looks like
[47:25] there's no light at the end of the
[47:26] tunnel you can still say I believe that
[47:29] God is and God's word still holds true
[47:31] regardless of what the circumstances
[47:34] look like now brother Brandon would say
[47:35] like this now Faith is not based upon
[47:38] the shifting Sands of man's ideas you
[47:40] just he said if I come here and told you
[47:42] there was an angel the Lord that was in
[47:43] the building and all these things
[47:45] happening if you didn't have something
[47:47] to prove that to you you'd have a right
[47:49] to doubt it but he said God gave a gift
[47:51] to do a certain thing and You' seen it
[47:53] come right back around and fail he said
[47:55] you'd say that's wrong but when it comes
[47:56] back and God proves it every time to be
[47:59] perfect then that's right God has proved
[48:01] to be true God has proven it now faith
[48:04] has to have a resting place and if you
[48:06] were going to get married he said some
[48:08] of you young men or or young women to
[48:10] get married he said then you'd have to
[48:12] have faith on who you would marry you'd
[48:14] have to have faith if you're a man you
[48:16] have to have faith in the woman you're
[48:17] marrying you believe she's going to be a
[48:18] good wife you believe she's going to be
[48:20] a good mother you don't go in blindly
[48:22] thinking well this might work out or it
[48:24] might not work out no you've got a faith
[48:26] in that person or you've got faith where
[48:28] you go to church you believe the
[48:29] Pastor's going to feed you you believe
[48:30] the pastor's got your best interest in
[48:32] mind see these are all things that you
[48:35] have to have faith to believe in can you
[48:37] say Amen but when you lose your faith
[48:40] many times we lose our faith in the
[48:42] valley but remember brother brand
[48:44] teaches us in the valley is where the
[48:45] Lily grows well can you say Amen it's
[48:47] not on the mountain top the Mountaintop
[48:49] experiences are fun and the Mountaintop
[48:51] experiences are nice but often times you
[48:53] do your most growing when you're in the
[48:54] valley often times you realize who you
[48:57] are and you get down to business with
[48:58] God and say Lord I you cry out to God
[49:01] I'll tell you it's a lot harder to pray
[49:03] when you don't need something but when
[49:04] you need something from God then you're
[49:06] down on your knees begging God to do
[49:08] something why because you have to reach
[49:10] down to the heart faith and say Lord I
[49:12] need more of you Lord I need I I don't
[49:15] have any money in the bank and I need
[49:16] more of you I need you to provide all my
[49:18] needs and if you really believe he is
[49:21] more than able to do that why because he
[49:23] said he could provide all your needs he
[49:25] said you would never beg for bread he
[49:27] said you would you would make it well
[49:29] come on somebody he said you wouldn't
[49:31] lose one of your children but you've got
[49:33] to have faith to believe it and it's got
[49:35] to be more than an intellectual Faith
[49:37] now we go a little deeper in this
[49:39] intellectual Faith here and the
[49:40] intellectual faith is what the devil has
[49:42] the intellectual faith is what many
[49:44] Christians have can you say Amen the
[49:47] intellectual faith is something that
[49:48] that like I said when everything's going
[49:50] good intellectual faith is easy to have
[49:52] intellectual Faith doesn't challenge
[49:54] anything then every this is the way the
[49:56] church is are going we're just going to
[49:57] be this kind of a Christian because
[49:59] intellectually we believe that this must
[50:01] be right but if you ever get Faith In
[50:03] Your Heart then it may be a challenge to
[50:05] you and it may actually God may let you
[50:07] go through some things but when you come
[50:09] out on the other side you'll realize
[50:11] your faith was holding you the whole
[50:13] time now think back to the widow woman
[50:15] there in the Bible when Elijah comes to
[50:17] her and she only has a little bit of
[50:19] meal left in the barrel and just a
[50:21] little bit of Cru a little Cru of oil
[50:23] left and that's all she's got but she's
[50:25] willing to give that up because she
[50:27] believes God will provide sir now if she
[50:31] didn't believe God would provide she
[50:32] would just go ahead and eat that and at
[50:34] least have one final meal but what she
[50:36] believed was this is the man of God
[50:37] standing here asking for something and
[50:40] I'm going to give everything I've got to
[50:42] him well come on somebody I'm going to
[50:44] give up everything I've got I might not
[50:46] be able to live my son might not be able
[50:47] to live but if God can send a man of God
[50:49] to your front door then God is able to
[50:52] put meal in the barrel God is able to
[50:54] put oil in the Cru God is more than why
[50:57] because of faith that woman had to act
[50:59] on something now she could say I believe
[51:01] this is a prophet of God I I believe
[51:03] this word that he come and told me I
[51:05] believe I believe but she had to prove
[51:07] her faith with her actions can you say
[51:10] amen and that's what we're going to have
[51:11] to do many times if you go through life
[51:13] and you start saying well I believe I
[51:15] believe God's going to prove that Faith
[51:17] God's going to make you prove that Faith
[51:19] God's going to put you through something
[51:20] and see if you'll stay with it yeah well
[51:23] can you say Amen God's going to
[51:24] challenge you at some point remember job
[51:26] was a man who was perfect and upright
[51:28] and yet God would challenge him and
[51:30] allow Satan to put put him through all
[51:32] kinds of things why because it was a
[51:34] trial of his faith and that trial of
[51:36] your faith is more precious than gold
[51:38] tried in the fire and if you'll ever
[51:40] take that scripture and look into the
[51:42] gold and and in the med Medieval Times
[51:44] what they would do with that gold is
[51:45] they would beat it and the the the
[51:47] beater would actually beat that gold
[51:49] until he he could see his reflection in
[51:51] it and many times God is doing that to
[51:53] us he's he's beating that gold he's
[51:55] trying to get all the draw off of you
[51:57] he's trying to make you gold he's trying
[51:59] to make you something but you've got to
[52:01] go through a trial to get there you've
[52:03] got to go through tests after test and
[52:05] every son that comes to God must be
[52:07] tested and TR and tried can you say Amen
[52:09] tonight so we don't believe that this is
[52:11] just a flowery bed of ease we don't
[52:13] believe that just this is just a picnic
[52:15] and all the quotes you've heard on that
[52:16] we don't believe that this is just going
[52:18] to be easy but we will be tried we will
[52:21] be tested but we will overcome can you
[52:24] say Amen we are more than than able
[52:27] brother Rand says it like this the only
[52:29] solid resting place for faith is on
[52:31] God's word how many can say Amen to that
[52:34] God's word is a solid rock any faith
[52:36] that anybody wants to have in the
[52:37] Supernatural it must be placed first in
[52:39] the word of the Living God now how he
[52:42] said how it's been through the age how
[52:43] that when men of old in all ages when
[52:45] they would really find the word of God
[52:46] and could grasp it Faith went into
[52:48] action right away and brother brandom
[52:50] uses Noah as an example here Noah would
[52:53] stand there and preach sermon after
[52:55] sermon and he PR preach the same sermon
[52:57] with the same
[52:58] title after the same title and the same
[53:02] sermon and no doubt that would drive
[53:04] people away in
[53:05] itself because Mo Noah you need to come
[53:08] up with some new content you need to
[53:09] tell us what we want to hear and yet he
[53:11] was telling them what God had already
[53:12] told him to say well come on somebody
[53:15] there there the congregation was sitting
[53:16] there week after week thinking Noah we
[53:18] wish you'd preach on this and we wish
[53:20] you'd preach on that well God was giving
[53:22] him the word of the Lord and he was
[53:23] preaching exactly what God wanted to
[53:25] warn them about and yet they just
[53:27] couldn't be satisfied with it why
[53:29] because they just didn't really believe
[53:31] the message he was preaching was from
[53:34] God but had they really believed they'd
[53:36] have been in the ark on the opening day
[53:38] I mean they'd have been there they'd
[53:39] have been the first person waiting why
[53:41] because we've heard the word of the Lord
[53:42] now we're acting on the word of the Lord
[53:44] and they they would have been saved but
[53:46] see what happens is as you say oh I
[53:48] believe in I believe in this and I
[53:50] believe I believe there could be a flood
[53:52] but we'll just wait and see what happens
[53:53] no the word is going to come true with
[53:56] or without you you might as well get on
[53:58] the ark
[53:59] now and so what you'll find is there's
[54:01] all kinds of doubters there's all kinds
[54:03] of people that says well it's not
[54:04] raining yet and there's all kinds of
[54:06] people that would say well I I just wish
[54:08] something would happen to show me that
[54:10] God is real well God has already sent
[54:12] you a sign in your time you either
[54:13] Believe it or you don't can you say Amen
[54:16] God's already Vindicated himself through
[54:18] a prophet you either Believe it or you
[54:19] don't God already send a message he
[54:21] would send one to an age and the people
[54:23] of the age would either Believe it or
[54:25] they would reject it but I'm glad
[54:26] tonight to be associated with believers
[54:29] who will say Amen to everything a
[54:31] prophet said we're not backing down from
[54:33] it we're not scared of it we're not
[54:35] going to lay down and say well the Ley
[54:37] and age is here and this didn't happen
[54:39] and and you know maybe the prophecies
[54:41] will fail no the prophecies are coming
[54:43] hold on to the word of the Lord for your
[54:45] day hold on to the word that has been
[54:47] preached because sometime or another
[54:49] it's going to rain sir can you say Amen
[54:53] now brother Brandon would go on down and
[54:55] he would say now so many revivals are
[54:57] going across the country and people are
[54:58] claiming to be saved and great
[55:00] evangelist saying they had so many
[55:01] thousands saved and so forth he said I
[55:03] believe it's when you go back and find
[55:05] out those people don't stay they just
[55:07] it's just an emotion in the meeting and
[55:08] a worked up meeting many people in the
[55:11] meeting raise up and claim healing and
[55:12] walk away more by emotion more by
[55:15] psychic than they do by real divine
[55:17] revelation of the Lord Jesus and so the
[55:19] first little pain strikes them and they
[55:21] give up and say well I didn't get my
[55:22] healing now if you really believe that
[55:24] with your heart 10,000 and pains would
[55:27] never make you give up well can somebody
[55:28] say Amen tonight it don't matter how you
[55:30] feel it's what his word already said if
[55:33] he said you're healed you're healed if
[55:35] he said the bills are paid the bills are
[55:36] paid well come on somebody and you say
[55:38] well that's that's health wealth and
[55:40] prosperity preaching I'm just going to
[55:41] tell you right now God is not willing
[55:43] that any should perish and he's not
[55:45] willing that you should go hungry he is
[55:47] not willing that you should lose a child
[55:49] he is not willing to see you suffer but
[55:51] if you'll trust him he'll never leave
[55:53] you down there but he'll raise you up as
[55:55] pure he'll raise you up so that you can
[55:58] put food on your table he'll raise you
[56:00] up and give you the job you need sir can
[56:02] you say Amen sir but when one little
[56:05] thing goes wrong we give up but if God's
[56:07] word is promised to provide for you you
[56:09] don't ever give up no matter how bad the
[56:12] how tough it gets or how bad the
[56:14] situation gets now brother R would go on
[56:16] down he said 10,000 pains will never
[56:18] make you give up that's right because
[56:20] your faith has already went into motion
[56:22] and you're in action right then now
[56:24] brother BR goes on down he said when God
[56:26] spoke to Noah and told him the
[56:27] impossible he said there was no rain
[56:29] never had rain never was a cloud in the
[56:31] sky or anything else but Noah knew that
[56:33] it was going to rain because God said so
[56:35] imagine Noah standing there he's having
[56:37] to explain what rain is because they had
[56:39] never rained before he's having to
[56:41] explain to these people this is what's
[56:43] going to happen and water's going to
[56:44] cover the Earth and there had never been
[56:46] rain they had never even seen a cloud
[56:48] they had never even seen an evidence
[56:51] that this word could take place well can
[56:53] you say Amen now he said now he said
[56:56] said what you'll find is most always
[56:57] when you find people that'll dare to
[56:59] take God at his word they're considered
[57:01] neurotics or Fanatics and the real True
[57:03] Believer has never had the world to Pat
[57:05] him on the back it's always been against
[57:06] him because he takes God at his word and
[57:09] God has never been a friend to the world
[57:11] in the way of the world being a friend
[57:12] of God he said they're against God
[57:15] because they can't understand God and
[57:16] you'll never know God Only By Faith Can
[57:19] you say Amen but Noah he moved with he
[57:22] moved with the fear of God knowing that
[57:24] there was coming a destruction and so he
[57:26] built the ark now there's an action to
[57:28] Noah's Faith Noah could preach about it
[57:31] Noah could talk about it but he had to
[57:33] put his faith into action can you say
[57:35] Amen it's one thing to talk about the
[57:36] message but it's another thing to live
[57:38] the message if you believe the message
[57:39] you're going to put it into action well
[57:41] can you say Amen now because God's word
[57:44] has got to be has got to be applied to
[57:46] our lives it's it's one thing to and I
[57:49] this is my background so I'll talk about
[57:50] it it's one thing to press play and say
[57:52] I obey I do this and but but the very
[57:54] fact that you're not preaching the
[57:55] gospel and you're called to preach tells
[57:57] me you're not obeying what the voice is
[57:59] saying so what You' got to do is take
[58:01] what you've heard and put it into action
[58:03] I I believe in here in the tapes but
[58:05] don't just let it be a letter but let
[58:07] the spirit Quicken it to somebody and
[58:09] take this message and preach the gospel
[58:11] to the people I say it's time we raise
[58:13] up and quit letting the devil keep us
[58:16] down and putting us down in second place
[58:18] when where we belong is in the
[58:20] heavenlies believing that God will do
[58:22] the miraculous believing that God's
[58:24] going to heal and he's going to save why
[58:26] because his word has already promised to
[58:28] do it and all we have to do is just
[58:31] believe because if you can believe from
[58:33] the heart all things are
[58:36] possible now intellectual faith will
[58:38] never do that intellectual faith will
[58:39] never heal you intellectual faith will
[58:41] never save you intellectual faith will
[58:43] not hold you in the time in the in the
[58:45] time of of Trials but but God's faith in
[58:48] the heart will holds you thanks for the
[58:51] amen
[58:53] sir but brother BR would go on down like
[58:55] this he said
[58:56] little group in here tonight a little
[58:58] group tonight he said it makes no
[58:59] difference how it looks don't reason it
[59:02] can you say Amen don't reason it it
[59:04] makes no difference it don't reason if
[59:05] you've only got intellectual faith
[59:07] you'll reason God's word you'll try to
[59:09] reason it see now let me see now the
[59:11] doctor said I can't get well and if the
[59:13] doctor said so that ought to settle it
[59:15] that's reason Faith don't reason Faith
[59:17] believes it anyhow well your cancer was
[59:19] stage one now it's stage two thank God
[59:21] I'm Healed your your cancer was stage
[59:23] three now it's stage four I tell you
[59:25] we've got a testimony in this day of
[59:27] cancer not taken yet when the doctor
[59:29] says so look at brother Ron Spencer and
[59:31] you see that the man's still preaching
[59:32] the gospel and he should have been dead
[59:34] several years ago but I'm going to tell
[59:35] you right now God is still God and he's
[59:38] more than able to hold a man with cancer
[59:41] he's more than able when God's through
[59:43] with him God will take him home but
[59:44] until then there's not a devil of cancer
[59:47] there's not a stroke there's not a demon
[59:49] Out of Hell there's not a car accident
[59:51] nothing can take you until God is done
[59:54] with you can you say amen so we've got
[59:57] to have faith you say well so and so
[59:59] died with this disease it was their time
[1:00:01] to go but I'm going to tell you right
[1:00:02] now if it's not your time just believe
[1:00:05] and God will take care of you I'm not
[1:00:08] saying people don't die but I'm saying
[1:00:10] this that if you have faith if you can't
[1:00:12] believe all things are possible if you
[1:00:14] need to be healed God's already healed
[1:00:16] you if you need more uh if you need more
[1:00:19] of the Holy Ghost to need a refilling I
[1:00:21] believe there's more for you before
[1:00:23] there was ever a Fin on the fish's back
[1:00:25] there had to be water for to swim in but
[1:00:27] I want to say tonight we've got to have
[1:00:29] faith that God has created you in such a
[1:00:32] time as this and he has put the right
[1:00:34] DNA in place so that you could withstand
[1:00:36] the the times that you're living in and
[1:00:38] you would be a believer in this time
[1:00:40] you're not sitting in a Baptist Church
[1:00:41] for a reason you're not sitting in the
[1:00:43] Methodist Church for a reason you're not
[1:00:45] sitting down here in the nightclubs and
[1:00:47] the bars for a reason sister Stephanie
[1:00:49] God brought you back for a reason and
[1:00:51] God will hold you because God is more
[1:00:54] than able to raise up children out of
[1:00:57] stones themselves listen God will use
[1:00:59] whatever he wants God will do whatever
[1:01:01] he wants all we've got to do is believe
[1:01:04] it because all things are possible
[1:01:06] somebody say all things all things so
[1:01:08] you put you put a name on your problem
[1:01:10] and it's possible that God's going to
[1:01:12] take care of it I'd say it's more than
[1:01:14] possible i' say it's already done if
[1:01:16] your faith can match up to it so we go
[1:01:19] on down here and uh you've heard you've
[1:01:21] heard testimonies before people say well
[1:01:23] I'm going to I'm going to lose my house
[1:01:24] or I'm going to lose my Electric's going
[1:01:25] to get and somebody walk after the
[1:01:26] mailbox and a checks there I know these
[1:01:28] things kind of become oldfashioned and
[1:01:30] we don't really believe them anymore but
[1:01:31] you know it's still true you know God
[1:01:33] still more than able to do that God's
[1:01:35] still more than able to work on on one
[1:01:37] end down here to provide a need for
[1:01:39] somebody over here God is more than able
[1:01:42] when did we quit believing God God never
[1:01:44] quit doing Miracles God never give up on
[1:01:46] us why would we give up on God can you
[1:01:49] say Amen there's no reason for it
[1:01:52] there's no reason for us to start
[1:01:53] doubting God when it gets tough because
[1:01:56] every man that comes listen we've
[1:01:57] already got proof that that that people
[1:01:59] are going to go through trials Jesus
[1:02:01] himself would go through trials but in
[1:02:02] the end listen the devil couldn't hold
[1:02:04] him down what can you say amen and if
[1:02:06] that same spirit that raised up him from
[1:02:08] the dead dwells in you it will Quicken
[1:02:10] your mortal body well come on somebody I
[1:02:12] tell you if you really knew who you were
[1:02:14] if you knew you were a Son of God if you
[1:02:16] knew you were a daughter of God then let
[1:02:18] me just go ahead and tell you not a
[1:02:19] devil in hell can stop you from
[1:02:23] receiving every promise that is in the
[1:02:25] book now brother bandam said if you've
[1:02:27] only got a mental conception of the
[1:02:28] Bible you say well I believed it because
[1:02:30] I read it God's got to reveal it to you
[1:02:32] now remember brother bandam teaches that
[1:02:34] faith is a revelation can you say Amen
[1:02:36] Faith you've got to you've got to know
[1:02:38] that it really is you can't just think
[1:02:40] it is you can't think it's going to be
[1:02:42] okay you got to believe from your heart
[1:02:43] that it's going to be okay and he said
[1:02:45] well I believe it because I read it and
[1:02:47] God but God's got to reveal it to you no
[1:02:49] man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:02:51] the holy spirit let me just go ahead and
[1:02:53] tell you tonight you want to know how a
[1:02:54] lot of our our doubts be solved get the
[1:02:57] baptism of the Holy
[1:02:58] Ghost if you could receive the Holy
[1:03:01] Ghost you say well I receive the Holy
[1:03:02] Ghost but I'm still struggling I say get
[1:03:04] a baptism again and baptism after
[1:03:06] baptism refilling after refilling don't
[1:03:09] ever stop and be be be be you say well
[1:03:12] I'm just I'm okay because I received it
[1:03:13] no don't stop at your first feeling but
[1:03:16] go on into the blessings of God and
[1:03:18] receive after receive and because God
[1:03:20] wants to give you more of him every time
[1:03:22] you come to the house of God God doesn't
[1:03:25] want you to set there with worry God
[1:03:26] doesn't want you to sit there with a
[1:03:28] frown on your face well can you say man
[1:03:30] God doesn't want you to sit there and be
[1:03:32] worried about the bills coming to
[1:03:33] tomorrow no God wants you to be like
[1:03:35] little children and live happy before
[1:03:38] him well come on somebody God knows what
[1:03:41] you're going through and he's already
[1:03:43] got a solution for you if you'll just
[1:03:45] believe that God still works in Mighty
[1:03:49] ways we've given up on God we've let God
[1:03:51] we've we've let worry take the place of
[1:03:53] faith and and if you let worry take the
[1:03:55] place of faith and well I tell you
[1:03:57] what's going to happen you're going to
[1:03:58] worry yourself into a sickness and
[1:03:59] brother Brandon would say worry caused
[1:04:01] disease and worry could cause cancer and
[1:04:03] worry can cause all these things you say
[1:04:05] well I'm just so worried I say don't
[1:04:07] worry just believe and I know you say
[1:04:10] well brother Joel do you ever wor oh yes
[1:04:12] that devil will come by every day the
[1:04:13] devil's going to come by and and he's
[1:04:15] going to he's going to let you get in
[1:04:16] the Blues sometimes and he's going to
[1:04:17] try to tell you that God doesn't really
[1:04:19] heal but let me tell you something many
[1:04:21] times we think of those thoughts coming
[1:04:23] to us as evil thoughts sometimes it's
[1:04:25] just a doubt that comes to us you don't
[1:04:27] have to let that doubt rest in your mind
[1:04:30] because what you do is you cast the
[1:04:32] doubts out by the hearing of the word
[1:04:34] cast the doubts out by saying devil go
[1:04:36] back to hell where you come from you
[1:04:38] don't even have the keys to your own
[1:04:40] house you've been stripped of them and I
[1:04:42] believe that God is going to take care
[1:04:44] of every situation in my life I don't
[1:04:47] know who this is for but I'm going to
[1:04:48] tell you right now I think it's time we
[1:04:50] quit giving way to the devil we let the
[1:04:52] devil tell us this and tell us what
[1:04:54] we're going through and and the Devil
[1:04:56] comes around and he'll tell you yeah
[1:04:57] you're going through a hard time and it
[1:04:59] it may not get any better for you and
[1:05:00] you know you may not be able to pay them
[1:05:02] bills and the devil is like job's
[1:05:03] comforter well you know it's just
[1:05:05] everything's falling apart for you you
[1:05:07] might as well Curse God did you ever
[1:05:09] think that that's the time when you need
[1:05:10] to really believe did you ever think
[1:05:12] that when you're going through I'm just
[1:05:14] going to say it when you're going
[1:05:15] through the worst time in your life and
[1:05:17] you say well I believe the message I
[1:05:19] believe the message I say that's God
[1:05:20] trying to prove that you really believe
[1:05:22] what you say you believe God wants to
[1:05:24] know are you really a Believer well come
[1:05:27] on somebody you say well he already
[1:05:29] knows but he wants to show the devil
[1:05:30] whose side you're really
[1:05:32] on resist the devil and he'll flee far
[1:05:37] from you I believe that he'll flee far
[1:05:40] away so what you say is this you say
[1:05:42] well brother Brandon would say like this
[1:05:44] if you've really based your faith on
[1:05:45] God's Eternal Word and it's down in your
[1:05:47] heart all Devils out of Torment can't
[1:05:50] upset you well well we could read that
[1:05:53] again if you've really if you've really
[1:05:56] based your faith on God's Eternal Word
[1:05:59] and it's down in your heart now it's not
[1:06:01] just on the page but it's in the heart
[1:06:03] and if it's in the heart all Devils out
[1:06:06] of Torment can't upset you and somebody
[1:06:10] ought to say Amen to that because we get
[1:06:12] upset and we get mad and sometimes we
[1:06:15] lash out because things are going our
[1:06:17] way that's the devil tormenting you but
[1:06:19] if you just believe God's word get it
[1:06:22] off the letter get it off the tape and
[1:06:24] put it in your heart then God can really
[1:06:26] go to work in that heart then because
[1:06:28] it's a man with faith it's a man that
[1:06:30] believes that whatever you have for me
[1:06:32] Lord I'm willing to take it if it's I
[1:06:35] tell you what if it's a trial then take
[1:06:37] me through the trial because I know that
[1:06:39] I'm not going to lose in the trial but
[1:06:41] you've already seen the other side of it
[1:06:43] and I'm coming out as pure gold I say
[1:06:45] he's not going to leave you because it's
[1:06:47] in the valley where he restores your
[1:06:49] soul he's not going to leave you in the
[1:06:51] valley he'll bring you back up when you
[1:06:53] need to let me tell you something God is
[1:06:55] going to give you something more than
[1:06:56] you can handle he's going to let he
[1:06:58] knows how far you can go he said you
[1:07:00] can't take job's life he can't take your
[1:07:02] life listen he may let all hell break
[1:07:05] loose on you but he'll never take your
[1:07:07] life let me tell you something you say
[1:07:09] well he could take my children he took
[1:07:11] job's children but he restored
[1:07:12] everything back to him and I believe in
[1:07:14] a god of restoration I believe in a god
[1:07:16] of healing I believe in a God that can
[1:07:19] that can provide for somebody who needs
[1:07:21] money in the bank I believe in it I
[1:07:23] believe with all my heart that we serve
[1:07:25] a Living God I believe that we are not
[1:07:27] just talking about a living God but we
[1:07:29] know that he's real we've seen the signs
[1:07:32] we've seen the vindications we've heard
[1:07:34] the voice we know who he is but it's
[1:07:37] time to put that in action and not leave
[1:07:39] it in 1947 not leave it in 1963 but it's
[1:07:42] time to take it off the tape and take it
[1:07:44] off the Bible listen let's Lift Jesus
[1:07:46] out of history and make him a living God
[1:07:49] in a living body on the Earth today I
[1:07:52] believe that we are the ones that can do
[1:07:53] it we are the bride of Christ
[1:07:55] listen no other church is sitting out on
[1:07:57] a 7:00 on a Wednesday night and and just
[1:07:59] saying that we are the bride of Christ
[1:08:01] listen I'm going to tell you what
[1:08:02] they're doing they're sitting down
[1:08:03] they're telling well if you can do this
[1:08:05] if you can jump through this hoop and
[1:08:06] you can speak in tongues like this or or
[1:08:08] or maybe they've canceled Church all
[1:08:10] together because they don't really see
[1:08:11] the importance of it but let me just go
[1:08:13] ahead and tell you you've come here
[1:08:15] because you believe the word of God that
[1:08:17] said assemble yourselves together and so
[1:08:19] you've acted on the word by coming to
[1:08:20] church on a Wednesday night you act on
[1:08:22] the word by going to church on a Sunday
[1:08:24] morning well can you say amen you've
[1:08:26] acted on the word now God is obligated
[1:08:29] to back up his word here tonight can you
[1:08:32] say amen
[1:08:33] Amen brother bam said it like this I'm
[1:08:35] gonna skip on down here because I didn't
[1:08:37] set my
[1:08:39] timer somebody said oh oh help him Lord
[1:08:42] yes well I'm watching the clock so we'll
[1:08:44] be okay maybe and he said what if
[1:08:47] Pharaoh would have looked into the word
[1:08:48] of God he would have changed his
[1:08:50] attitude towards
[1:08:52] Moses oh think about it think about
[1:08:55] about it sir if Pharaoh would have just
[1:08:58] looked into the word of God he would
[1:08:59] have changed his
[1:09:00] attitude he would have changed his
[1:09:02] attitude and he said the rest of the
[1:09:03] Israelites if he'd have looked into the
[1:09:05] word and see where God promised by his
[1:09:08] word he was going to bring the children
[1:09:09] of Israel out of Egypt he would have
[1:09:11] done it he would have changed his
[1:09:12] attitude towards the people but he was
[1:09:14] so busy he went to church sure a very
[1:09:17] religious
[1:09:19] man so going to church is not enough we
[1:09:22] can all agree on that right
[1:09:25] he said a very religious man Pharaoh
[1:09:27] went to church I didn't know
[1:09:28] that thankful for a prophet he went to
[1:09:32] church a very religious man and he went
[1:09:34] to church and he was a what you call a
[1:09:36] mental
[1:09:37] believer he said and so he said he had
[1:09:41] uh whatever you want to call it he had
[1:09:42] knowledge of what he was doing in the
[1:09:43] mental way but to have a real Revelation
[1:09:45] that God was going to keep that word if
[1:09:47] he have had that he wouldn't have acted
[1:09:49] towards Moses the way he did now going
[1:09:53] down where he talks about Moses he said
[1:09:54] in Moses's faith did not rest upon what
[1:09:56] he could do with the biggest army in the
[1:09:58] world it didn't rest on what he could do
[1:10:00] sitting on Pharaoh's Throne as a pharaoh
[1:10:02] his faith rested upon what thus sayith
[1:10:04] the Lord had said now you think about it
[1:10:06] Moses could have just been pharaoh and
[1:10:08] we would have never had the testimony of
[1:10:10] being delivered out of the hand of
[1:10:12] pharaoh on well come on somebody if if
[1:10:16] Moses would have just done his job and
[1:10:19] set on the throne and been the next
[1:10:21] Pharaoh then they would have never
[1:10:23] reached the promised land because he
[1:10:25] would have been content with where he
[1:10:27] was there would have been nothing to run
[1:10:29] him away from there it would have been
[1:10:30] nothing to try him out and see if he was
[1:10:32] really going to be the man for the job
[1:10:34] but what happened was God knew that he
[1:10:37] was not going to be able to stay there
[1:10:38] all his education could not keep Moses
[1:10:40] in Egypt all the education could not
[1:10:42] prepare him for the battles that would
[1:10:44] be ahead all of the Educational Systems
[1:10:47] could not bind Moses to Egypt but what
[1:10:50] it was it was faith that the word of God
[1:10:52] was in his heart and that Faith was down
[1:10:54] there he was already appointed he was
[1:10:57] predestinated for a time to where he
[1:10:59] would be a leader of Israel and and
[1:11:01] Moses would have to actually come out of
[1:11:03] this land and go over the Jordan and he
[1:11:06] would have to come out but he had to
[1:11:07] come out in a way that would seem
[1:11:09] impossible to the people he would have
[1:11:11] to show God to be true because these
[1:11:13] people were going to be in the
[1:11:14] wilderness for a really long time and so
[1:11:17] they had to see something in the in in
[1:11:19] the beginning to know that we are
[1:11:21] following a real prophet and so that's
[1:11:23] what I look at that as the first Po and
[1:11:25] the second pool of brother Brand's
[1:11:26] Ministry there had to be something to
[1:11:28] catch the people's attention can you say
[1:11:30] Amen there had to be something that it
[1:11:32] would say well let me let me see what
[1:11:34] this man's got to say let me see what
[1:11:36] this prophet's got to say there had to
[1:11:38] be something to get the people's
[1:11:39] attention so that they would follow this
[1:11:41] man because God has always done it that
[1:11:43] way God had a pillar of fire with Moses
[1:11:45] and God had a pillar of fire in our day
[1:11:47] can you say Amen we're not following
[1:11:49] just another man we're not following
[1:11:51] another faith healer we're not following
[1:11:52] another evangelist what we're following
[1:11:54] is the prophet of God Vindicated by the
[1:11:57] same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses
[1:12:00] that was with Paul and that was all down
[1:12:02] through the age listen it is the same
[1:12:04] God doing the same Works among his
[1:12:06] people he will not leave you in Egypt
[1:12:08] but he has provided a way for you to
[1:12:09] come out though Pharaoh's Army was
[1:12:11] closing in though Pharaoh's Army looked
[1:12:13] like they would overtake him there was a
[1:12:15] god there that would that would blind
[1:12:17] the enemy and would deliver his children
[1:12:19] Time After Time After Time and even when
[1:12:22] they get to the promised land they would
[1:12:24] get there and the first thing they get
[1:12:25] to is they see walled cities and and
[1:12:28] there's Giants there and and you know
[1:12:30] what Caleb would stand up and say give
[1:12:31] me my Mountain well come on somebody
[1:12:33] Caleb believed that God was more than
[1:12:36] able he brought me out of Egypt he
[1:12:38] brought me through all the years in the
[1:12:39] wilderness if God could do that God can
[1:12:42] take out these Giants if God could bring
[1:12:44] you here if he could save you from The
[1:12:46] Sinner you were then God is more than
[1:12:49] able to take care of you on the journey
[1:12:51] called
[1:12:52] life sir we look back and we forget what
[1:12:55] God's done for us it's good to look back
[1:12:57] sometimes and give God some praise for
[1:12:58] what he's done for us you know a new
[1:13:00] Christian a lot of times is on fire for
[1:13:02] God you know why because they realize
[1:13:04] what God has done for them but he woke
[1:13:06] you up this morning and he started you
[1:13:08] on your way you might as well give God
[1:13:10] thanks for that too you might as well
[1:13:11] say you know what I'm glad I'm not in
[1:13:13] the denomination but I'm flying free in
[1:13:15] the heavenlies why we ought to we ought
[1:13:17] to give God thanks for that we ought to
[1:13:19] give God thanks that we can still Gather
[1:13:21] in a church building like this and
[1:13:22] believe that God's word is being
[1:13:24] preached across the pulit we're not here
[1:13:26] to see a man we're not here just to just
[1:13:28] to feel good but what we're here to do
[1:13:30] is give God the glory because you
[1:13:32] brought me from a mighty long way you
[1:13:34] brought me from sin you brought me from
[1:13:36] all kinds of doubt and unbelief and I'll
[1:13:39] say this you brought me from just being
[1:13:40] a hearer only to endure also the word of
[1:13:43] God God is more than able to save souls
[1:13:46] and and save people from from an early
[1:13:48] grave God is still God can you say Amen
[1:13:52] but what we've done is we forgot where
[1:13:54] he brought us from and so we don't
[1:13:56] believe he can take us
[1:13:57] on well the church can say Amen sorry I
[1:14:01] got to pull for some amens on a
[1:14:02] Wednesday night don't make me do all the
[1:14:05] work you say well I don't like it well
[1:14:07] you can say Amen to the quotes here we
[1:14:09] go Moses would have take Taking
[1:14:11] Pharaoh's Throne it he said he said it
[1:14:13] wouldn't have been God's word and so it
[1:14:15] goes on down here for time's sake let's
[1:14:17] get on down here he said he said it's no
[1:14:21] good to you if you won't put Faith he
[1:14:23] said it don't matter how much Faith
[1:14:24] you've got if you won't use it it's no
[1:14:26] good to you he said that's right what
[1:14:29] what good is a god of Moses if he ain't
[1:14:31] the same God today what good well come
[1:14:34] on somebody what good is a god of
[1:14:36] William brandom if he's not the same God
[1:14:38] today what good is a God that was with
[1:14:41] Paul and struck him down on the road to
[1:14:43] Damascus if he's not the same God today
[1:14:45] what good is a historical God we can
[1:14:48] talk about him we can say how great he
[1:14:50] was it's it's kind of like talking about
[1:14:51] the president well Abraham Lincoln or or
[1:14:53] we can go a little bit newer we can go
[1:14:55] Ronald Reagan or or we'll stop there and
[1:14:58] you can say all kinds of things that how
[1:14:59] good the presidents were listen it don't
[1:15:02] matter if you're looking in the past
[1:15:03] that's not going to bring that's not
[1:15:04] going to do anything for you we've got
[1:15:05] to look to the future we got to know
[1:15:07] that the same God that work in is the
[1:15:09] same God that's going to work today and
[1:15:11] he's the same God that's going to work
[1:15:13] tomorrow and no matter how dark the
[1:15:15] world gets and how bad the world gets or
[1:15:17] how divided politics get it's not going
[1:15:19] to have one effect on the believer why
[1:15:21] because we're not here of this world
[1:15:23] we're not here we're not we're not we're
[1:15:25] our kingdom dwellers of this world but
[1:15:26] we're from a kingdom above can you say
[1:15:28] Amen we are more than able to keep on
[1:15:31] keeping on in this day because we're not
[1:15:33] looking here and we're not looking there
[1:15:35] and we're not looking at the plagues
[1:15:36] that are coming we're not looking at the
[1:15:37] bombs that are going to fall we're not
[1:15:39] worried about the wars that are
[1:15:40] happening that's just prophecy being
[1:15:42] fulfilled in our day that ought to give
[1:15:44] the believer that much more faith that
[1:15:46] God is still doing what he promised to
[1:15:49] do we just got to believe you say well I
[1:15:52] turn on the news and I get scared a
[1:15:53] Believer won't get scared a Believer
[1:15:55] don't turn on the news and get scared
[1:15:57] believer don't turn on the news no a
[1:15:59] Believer don't turn on the news and get
[1:16:00] scared but a Believer will look at that
[1:16:02] and say wars and rumors of wars that's
[1:16:05] prophecy being fulfilled earthquakes in
[1:16:07] diverse places that's prophecy being
[1:16:09] fulfilled sometimes you might shout a
[1:16:10] little bit when you're watching Fox
[1:16:12] because you see how bad it's
[1:16:14] getting and you realize how close we are
[1:16:18] well can you say Amen brother Bram said
[1:16:21] you people who go to church that's all
[1:16:23] of you tonight
[1:16:25] he said and your church only teaches he
[1:16:27] never
[1:16:28] mind you people that go to a
[1:16:30] denominational
[1:16:32] church but if you went to this church
[1:16:34] say you go to this church and if we only
[1:16:36] get up here and
[1:16:38] teach that some historical fact about
[1:16:40] the Holy Ghost coming back on the day of
[1:16:41] Pentecost we can tell you about how it
[1:16:43] fell on Paul we can tell you how it fell
[1:16:46] on the 120 we can tell you how it fell
[1:16:49] all down through every person in the
[1:16:51] Bible there we can tell you how it fell
[1:16:52] and and we can talk about we can talk
[1:16:54] about coming right up into the the 1906
[1:16:57] Pentecost we can tell you how it fell
[1:16:59] then and we can bring you out of
[1:17:00] Pentecost and show you how it fell in
[1:17:02] the message and if you don't bring it to
[1:17:04] this day you're talking about a
[1:17:05] historical God now we believe in looking
[1:17:08] back and seeing what God has done but if
[1:17:10] we don't believe it's the same God it
[1:17:12] didn't do you no good to look back what
[1:17:13] can you say Amen so we we've got to
[1:17:16] believe that God is more than just a
[1:17:18] historical God we cannot get to heaven
[1:17:22] and we're never going to make a Rapture
[1:17:23] on intellectual Faith because there's no
[1:17:25] proof of a Rapture
[1:17:28] intellectually there's no proof that
[1:17:30] there was a pillar fire with Moses
[1:17:33] intellectually there's no proof well
[1:17:36] come on somebody there's no proof that
[1:17:38] there was a cloud that back in with
[1:17:40] Moses up on the mountain there was no
[1:17:41] proof that God came down and wrote the
[1:17:43] Ten Commandments on a couple rocks
[1:17:45] there's no proof of that intellectually
[1:17:47] but we believe there's proof because
[1:17:49] it's in our hearts and it's written on
[1:17:51] our hearts and there's nothing there's
[1:17:53] no devil in hell that can take that out
[1:17:55] of our hearts why because we believe
[1:17:58] everything in the word is true now we've
[1:18:00] had some proof and we believe in the
[1:18:02] proof and that has gotten our attention
[1:18:04] but now we have become one with the word
[1:18:07] and there's nothing that can make us
[1:18:08] doubt that the word is true there's
[1:18:11] nothing that makes me doubt that job's
[1:18:12] story is true there there's nothing that
[1:18:14] can make me doubt that there was really
[1:18:16] three Hebrew boys that went into a fiery
[1:18:17] furnace and they come out alive listen
[1:18:20] nothing can make me doubt that because I
[1:18:22] believe the word of God is still true
[1:18:25] and I don't believe any devil in hell
[1:18:27] can ever cause me to Fall Away in this
[1:18:29] end
[1:18:30] time I like what the brother said at
[1:18:33] Camp I believe it's brother Josh Bennett
[1:18:34] he said we can fall down but we can't
[1:18:36] fall away we can fall down but we can't
[1:18:38] fall away we're going to make mistakes
[1:18:40] but we can't fall away you're going to
[1:18:42] fall down a lot of times but you cannot
[1:18:44] fall away there's all kinds of devils
[1:18:47] going to come after you there's going to
[1:18:48] be times when you don't feel like it
[1:18:50] there's going to be times when you don't
[1:18:51] feel saved there's going to be time well
[1:18:53] come on somebody there's going to be
[1:18:54] times when you feel like throwing your
[1:18:56] hands up and quitting but God is still
[1:18:58] God and if you'll just believe that what
[1:19:00] he did he's still doing and what he's
[1:19:03] doing he's going to keep on doing
[1:19:05] there's no reason to fear cancer there's
[1:19:07] no reason to fear heart trouble there's
[1:19:09] no reason to fear all these things why
[1:19:11] because God is still doing great things
[1:19:14] can you say Amen brother B would say it
[1:19:17] like this he said he said it wouldn't do
[1:19:19] you no more good he said to believe in
[1:19:22] George Washington once lived he said
[1:19:23] that's right Abraham Lincoln
[1:19:25] wouldn't do you no good to believe that
[1:19:26] they once lived according to history he
[1:19:28] said if he said but if they're dead and
[1:19:30] buried according to history wouldn't do
[1:19:31] you no good to believe that if you can't
[1:19:34] believe that those works could continue
[1:19:35] on and that party or whatever it was if
[1:19:37] there was not somebody to carry on that
[1:19:39] that that party's work or or or to do
[1:19:41] what them men could do today you have to
[1:19:43] believe that God still uses men you have
[1:19:44] to still believe that God still has a
[1:19:46] purpose for every one of us and you have
[1:19:48] to believe that it wasn't just for them
[1:19:50] but it's also for us and it wasn't just
[1:19:52] good enough for the 120 but I believe if
[1:19:54] there's 50 people sitting here on Hardy
[1:19:56] on a Wednesday night I would say that
[1:19:58] that same Holy Ghost can come down on us
[1:19:59] can you say amen I believe if we would
[1:20:01] just wait on him and quit getting in
[1:20:03] such a hurry and say well well I need to
[1:20:05] be out of here in five minutes let me go
[1:20:06] and tell you something I'm not going to
[1:20:08] hold you long but I'm GNA tell you we
[1:20:09] need to get so serious with God that we
[1:20:11] would be like buddy Robinson I'm just
[1:20:13] have the faith that I'm G to stay right
[1:20:15] here and this is where I'm going to get
[1:20:17] the Holy Ghost and Lord if you don't
[1:20:18] come you're going to find a pile of
[1:20:20] bones but I'm going to tell you if you
[1:20:21] ever get that serious God knew if he was
[1:20:24] serious and he came down and gave him
[1:20:26] the Holy Ghost let me go ahead and tell
[1:20:27] you something if you get serious with
[1:20:29] God and Believe from your heart then God
[1:20:32] will do the impossible and make it work
[1:20:34] in your situation you say well well you
[1:20:36] just don't see how bad it is for me
[1:20:38] listen I don't but he does I may not
[1:20:40] know what you're going through but we
[1:20:42] have a God who is more than able to take
[1:20:45] care of your situation he can walk down
[1:20:47] every aisle in this building and he
[1:20:49] knows exactly what's in your heart
[1:20:50] Brother David he knows exactly what's
[1:20:52] wrong in the family he knows exactly
[1:20:54] what's wrong in your in your work
[1:20:55] situation he knows exactly what's wrong
[1:20:57] with our young people and what they need
[1:20:59] but listen to me God is still more than
[1:21:01] able to walk down every aisle and touch
[1:21:04] every person I may not be able to do it
[1:21:06] but he can because God is more than
[1:21:09] enough can you say Amen God's more than
[1:21:13] enough sir amen what we need today
[1:21:16] brother is some real genuine Faith put
[1:21:19] into action can you say Amen we need
[1:21:21] real faith and Men Who dare to put God's
[1:21:22] word to their heart and apply it to
[1:21:24] themselves he said you try to apply it
[1:21:26] to the generation gone by but the Bible
[1:21:28] says that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:21:30] yesterday today and forever he's forever
[1:21:32] God he never fails he's the same in
[1:21:35] principle he's the same in power can you
[1:21:37] say Amen he's the same tonight that he
[1:21:39] was when he walked on well come on
[1:21:41] somebody he's the same tonight as when
[1:21:43] he was here physically walking on Earth
[1:21:45] and he said he appears nightly on the
[1:21:47] platform and proves himself alive from
[1:21:49] the dead he said you don't have to take
[1:21:51] any history about it it's right now
[1:21:53] present time fact and we see it you
[1:21:56] realize how much faith that we ought to
[1:21:58] have in this age because we've actually
[1:22:00] seen prophecy fulfilled and we've
[1:22:02] actually seen the scriptures come to
[1:22:03] life and we've actually seen listen i' I
[1:22:06] I've actually talked to a man and and
[1:22:07] there was there was many witnesses there
[1:22:09] down in Florida and and he was I talked
[1:22:11] to the man just recently on the phone
[1:22:13] and he was dead he died once in the
[1:22:15] meeting and they revived him and got him
[1:22:16] back he goes they take him into a room
[1:22:18] he dies again and he's dead for a while
[1:22:20] there's nurses there there's no pulse
[1:22:21] there's nothing by the time the
[1:22:23] ambulance get there they had prayed for
[1:22:24] the the man and the next thing you know
[1:22:25] he comes back up again listen I'm going
[1:22:27] to tell you a dead man that was raised
[1:22:29] twice in the same
[1:22:30] service I guess it wasn't his time and
[1:22:33] that was 20 years ago 20 years ago but
[1:22:35] that same God that was there is the same
[1:22:37] God here tonight but the only reason we
[1:22:39] don't see him is because we're not
[1:22:40] believing for it but if you'll just
[1:22:42] believe for well if my church did this
[1:22:44] or if the preacher would do this no it's
[1:22:46] you it's you it's you and God and you've
[1:22:49] got to get that heart so right with God
[1:22:51] that that you it's nothing between you
[1:22:53] and the Savior nothing nothing can stop
[1:22:55] you from loving him nothing can stop you
[1:22:56] from believing him nothing can stop you
[1:22:59] not even doubt itself can come I'll tell
[1:23:01] you I heard a brother say it and I'll
[1:23:02] repeat it he said you got to learn to
[1:23:04] doubt your doubts well can you say Amen
[1:23:06] you got to learn to doubt your doubts
[1:23:07] quit doubting quit quit quit doubting
[1:23:09] God's word and start doubting your
[1:23:11] doubts and I mean quit quit telling the
[1:23:13] devil how good he is and start telling
[1:23:14] God how real he is well it looks like
[1:23:17] everything's falling apart but the devil
[1:23:18] saying yes sir you're exactly right the
[1:23:20] devil's agreeing with you and the devil
[1:23:22] just wants you to feel so good about not
[1:23:25] going to church on a Wednesday night he
[1:23:26] wants you to feel so good about not
[1:23:27] going to church he he wants to make it
[1:23:29] so fun for you but you know when you're
[1:23:31] really doing the will of God he wants to
[1:23:33] make it so hard on you he does because
[1:23:37] the devil also is not happy when you're
[1:23:40] serving God but what but what you're
[1:23:42] doing is you're actually when you're
[1:23:44] when you're being tried and when you're
[1:23:45] being tested brother Brandon would say
[1:23:47] it like this he said if the devil's
[1:23:49] after you it proves he hadn't got you
[1:23:52] and I would say tonight if the devil's
[1:23:53] after you you need to praise God that
[1:23:55] you're still in the race if the devil's
[1:23:57] on your tail then you just better be
[1:23:59] singing all as well I tell you it's time
[1:24:02] we quit giving way to the devil it's
[1:24:04] time we quit telling the devil well I I
[1:24:07] I tell you the devil got a hold of me
[1:24:08] well quit testifying to the devil and
[1:24:10] start testifying of the goodness of God
[1:24:13] and all that he's done in your
[1:24:15] life because he's more than able can you
[1:24:19] say Amen we'll get way on down here cuz
[1:24:21] I don't know how much time I've been up
[1:24:23] here but I think it's been too long
[1:24:26] and I missed my timer so
[1:24:30] bad what good is it going to do for you
[1:24:33] to read of a historical God if he isn't
[1:24:35] the same God today y'all may miss my
[1:24:37] timer too if I go over
[1:24:38] time he said what good is it going to do
[1:24:41] to read about old George Washington if
[1:24:42] he's dead and gone see it's just a
[1:24:44] history fact what good is it going to be
[1:24:46] doing to talk about Jesus he said but
[1:24:48] Jesus raised from the dead and he's the
[1:24:50] same today what good does it do to paint
[1:24:52] fire to a a to a painted fire to a
[1:24:55] freezing

[1:24:58] the winter time and you're freezing to
[1:24:59] death That Fire won't do you no good
[1:25:02] well I can see the fire but I can't feel
[1:25:03] it why because it's not real because you
[1:25:06] you it's just a painted fire it's just a
[1:25:08] mirage it's nothing to you it's nothing
[1:25:10] you you've got to actually get the fire
[1:25:12] before you can ever feel the fire that
[1:25:14] that'll do for that'll do for more than
[1:25:16] one way I tell you you want to feel the

[1:25:58] in America of religion no wonder the
[1:25:59] magazine says the spiritual the
[1:26:02] spiritual is a is a b is a burst he said
[1:26:04] because they failed to represent the
[1:26:05] right thing to them they're trying to
[1:26:07] teach them of a historical God but what
[1:26:09] we need today is a god resurrected from
[1:26:11] the dead and on hand right now can you
[1:26:14] say Amen to do whatever he promised he
[1:26:17] would do to confirm his word and we need

[1:26:46] Amen you are willing so if God says
[1:26:49] you're already healed you just told me
[1:26:51] that you're willing to say I'm already
[1:26:52] healed no matter what the doctor said
[1:26:55] brother Paul you believe that Brother
[1:26:56] Paul's had some bad reports but I'm

[1:27:16] healed me yeah I I I know the devil can
[1:27:19] put cancer on me but he don't have to
[1:27:21] stay on me I know the devil can give you
[1:27:24] diabetes but he don't have to stay on
[1:27:26] you you I know the devil could I know
[1:27:28] the devil could cause you to to fall but
[1:27:30] you don't have to stay down you can get
[1:27:32] right back up again what can you say
[1:27:34] amen God is more than able to do
[1:27:38] everything his word has already said if
[1:27:40] it's in the word believe it if it's in
[1:27:43] the word I tell you what I think we need
[1:27:44] to quit preaching we quit quit preaching
[1:27:46] the message is something that we got to
[1:27:48] attain to and start believing that it is
[1:27:50] something we have now I I tell you the
[1:27:52] message is not something that we just
[1:27:54] barely Out Of Reach and we we almost got
[1:27:56] no the message is something we can live
[1:27:59] it is something we can get a hold of and
[1:28:01] we can apply to our lives we don't have
[1:28:03] to sit there and wonder about what's
[1:28:06] going to happen tomorrow because we
[1:28:07] don't know the future but he's got it
[1:28:10] all in control can you say
[1:28:12] Amen so brother R would say it like
[1:28:15] this any word that God said and put it
[1:28:18] on action any delegates willing to do
[1:28:20] that he said what we need is men and
[1:28:21] women who stand up to the Forefront
[1:28:23] there and call the devil a liar you get
[1:28:26] up in the morning you don't feel good
[1:28:28] you call that devil a liar what can you
[1:28:30] say amen that's not something I said the
[1:28:32] prophet said to do it somebody's got to
[1:28:34] stand at the Forefront of this battle
[1:28:36] and call the devil what he is he's a
[1:28:39] liar and he has no hold on you he listen
[1:28:42] he don't even add the keys to his own
[1:28:44] house he's locked out you're going to
[1:28:47] believe in a man like that when when
[1:28:48] when he's been stripped of his rights he
[1:28:50] has no right over you if you're a
[1:28:52] Believer the devil has nothing on you
[1:28:54] you oh somebody ought to just go ahead
[1:28:56] and get excited here tonight because I'm
[1:28:57] going to tell you something if you
[1:28:58] recognize that if you have this faith in
[1:29:00] your heart all things are possible just
[1:29:03] believe all things are possible I don't
[1:29:05] care what the devil's done to you I
[1:29:07] don't care what your neighbor's done to
[1:29:09] you I don't care what the preacher done
[1:29:10] to you all things are possible if you'll
[1:29:13] just
[1:29:14] believe well I've been dealt a bad hand
[1:29:16] it don't matter that's just the devil go
[1:29:18] ahead and let go of that and say God you
[1:29:21] you know maybe you know maybe God put
[1:29:22] you in that situation for a reason
[1:29:25] sir many times we'll run off when it
[1:29:28] gets tough but that's not what a
[1:29:30] Christian does a Christian is going to
[1:29:33] feel the heat of the battle and he's
[1:29:34] going to stand there and
[1:29:36] fight I'm just telling you what a
[1:29:38] prophet said is that okay because many
[1:29:40] times we get scared because we think
[1:29:43] we're out of the will of God because the
[1:29:45] battle comes and that's not true at all
[1:29:49] because what if job would have just
[1:29:50] thrown up his hands and got rid of
[1:29:52] everything and left the land I mean he
[1:29:54] could have he could have he could have
[1:29:56] left all them problems behind him but
[1:29:59] God had him there for a purpose and it
[1:30:02] didn't look like it it didn't feel like
[1:30:03] it for sure but he had him there for a
[1:30:06] purpose so brother random says it like
[1:30:08] this and I'll just St my notes for a
[1:30:10] minute before I close he said what good
[1:30:12] does it do to have a bird what good does
[1:30:15] it do for a bird to have wings if you've
[1:30:18] got him in a cage he can't fly he don't
[1:30:20] need no wings if you've got him in a
[1:30:22] cage he said oh that's the way a lot of
[1:30:23] these people are they're in a cage
[1:30:25] they're taught the days of Miracles has
[1:30:27] passed oh there's a God oh yes we
[1:30:29] believe that Jesus was his son I've
[1:30:31] accepted him as his personal savior but
[1:30:32] I tell you all those things is back
[1:30:34] there in the old days they're passed the
[1:30:36] days of Miracles has passed what Good's
[1:30:38] your wings going to do you he said what
[1:30:39] Good's your faith going to do you if you
[1:30:41] can't turn it loose come on somebody
[1:30:43] youve got to turn loose on that faith
[1:30:45] and say every devil in hell may be after
[1:30:47] me but I'm on The Winning Side there's
[1:30:50] not a devil that can catch me I tell you
[1:30:52] what you might be in this race and you
[1:30:54] might be trying to attain the finish
[1:30:56] line and the devil may be hot on your
[1:30:58] Trail but he cannot catch you he cannot
[1:31:01] stop you he cannot overtake you why
[1:31:04] because God has already ordained you for
[1:31:07] the Finish Line he's already I'll tell
[1:31:09] you what I tell you I I tell you I feel
[1:31:10] good right now I just want to preach for
[1:31:11] a minute that God has already given you
[1:31:14] the the trophy at the end God has
[1:31:16] already said he's already rigged the
[1:31:17] race and you're going to be just a
[1:31:19] little bit faster than that devil that's
[1:31:21] after you why because the devil might
[1:31:23] think it can catch you but God already
[1:31:25] knew that he couldn't because God would
[1:31:27] not have put you in a race that the
[1:31:29] devil could beat you in God would not
[1:31:31] have put you in this in this age if the
[1:31:33] devil could take you out God would not
[1:31:35] have put you in this church tonight if
[1:31:36] he thought the devil could get a hold of
[1:31:38] you and keep you in bondage any longer I
[1:31:40] believe you just need to accept your
[1:31:42] freedom tonight if you got Wings use
[1:31:44] them if you got faith use it if you need
[1:31:46] more of God reach out your hand to God
[1:31:48] and say I need more of you if you need
[1:31:50] something from God tonight don't doubt
[1:31:53] but just believe that God is still God
[1:31:55] and he's still more than able he's more
[1:31:58] than able he's not just able to do it
[1:32:00] but he's more than able sister Stephanie
[1:32:03] he's more than able he's more than able
[1:32:05] to go to where brother Bill is tonight
[1:32:06] and make him feel better he's more than
[1:32:08] able brother Harold to take care of that
[1:32:10] leukemia he's more than able to take you
[1:32:13] out of the situation you're in you say
[1:32:15] well it looks hopeless to me he's more
[1:32:17] than able all things are possible all
[1:32:21] things are possible if you believe
[1:32:24] all things are possible musicians go
[1:32:26] ahead and
[1:32:27] come if you would I want to just close
[1:32:29] on this one brother brand
[1:32:33] said brother R said you do something
[1:32:35] before the devil would tell
[1:32:38] Jesus if you'll just do
[1:32:40] this come off of that cross I believe
[1:32:43] you brother BR said it like this he
[1:32:47] said he said he said that's where every
[1:32:49] man he said Jesus would stand there and
[1:32:52] say Jesus would stand there it's not so
[1:32:55] and he would go on brother brandham
[1:32:56] stumbles around here for a minute and he
[1:32:58] actually changes the situation and goes
[1:32:59] to he goes to where turn these stones
[1:33:03] into bread and then Jesus would
[1:33:06] say Jesus would say it is written man
[1:33:08] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:33:10] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:33:12] mouth of God there's where his faith was
[1:33:14] anchored where was his faith anchored in
[1:33:17] the word does he provide all your needs
[1:33:20] the word says He does does he heal your
[1:33:22] body the word says he does
[1:33:24] does he save your soul the word says he
[1:33:26] does well I don't have the money to do
[1:33:27] this the word says it's already done if
[1:33:30] you just believe can you say am man
[1:33:32] let's stand to your feet tonight if you
[1:33:34] would brother brandom said it like this
[1:33:35] I want to just I just lay this in here
[1:33:38] we could just for a
[1:33:40] second Jesus when he was here on Earth
[1:33:42] he said verily I say unto you I can do
[1:33:44] nothing in myself I can do nothing but
[1:33:47] what the father shows me that I
[1:33:49] do now doubt did not come from this
[1:33:52] Bible but what he's shown you in the
[1:33:54] word is that you do not have to doubt
[1:33:57] what he's already shown you is that if
[1:33:59] you say to this mountain be thou removed
[1:34:02] it will
[1:34:03] move if you have need of something
[1:34:05] tonight all you have to do is speak use
[1:34:08] the faith that you've got it's just a
[1:34:10] grain of a mustard seed use what you got
[1:34:13] use what you've got and watch that come
[1:34:16] to pass because we don't have to wait on
[1:34:18] another Prophet we don't have to wait on
[1:34:21] another preacher we don't have to wait
[1:34:22] on someone else to come and and and work
[1:34:24] us into this it is just a faith in our
[1:34:27] heart believing that God is God was God
[1:34:31] is God always will be he's the same
[1:34:33] yesterday and today and forever we've
[1:34:37] heard that all of our Lives if you're in
[1:34:39] the message but at some time in your
[1:34:41] life it's got to become a reality that
[1:34:43] he's not just in history but he's now
[1:34:46] present Among Us can you say
[1:34:47] amen and brother Brandon would say like
[1:34:50] this I he said I can do nothing to
[1:34:51] myself but what the father shows me that
[1:34:53] I do he said I come to do the will of
[1:34:54] God and when he went away he said this
[1:34:56] ministry shall cease now for the very
[1:34:58] things that I do you will do also so he
[1:35:02] may not be here in a literal Corporal
[1:35:04] body tonight but he's here in you he's
[1:35:06] here in your flesh he's here in human
[1:35:09] flesh again on the earth as your Pastor
[1:35:12] T not too long ago he's back in Dusty
[1:35:14] clothes again he's back again but he's
[1:35:16] in human flesh he may be hid from the
[1:35:19] world but you can see because it's been
[1:35:21] revealed to you by faith that I am Son
[1:35:23] of God you are a daughter of God you
[1:35:26] have once been in sin but you're now
[1:35:28] placed in Heavenly places with Christ
[1:35:30] Jesus can you say
[1:35:32] Amen if you have a need
[1:35:36] tonight as I'm closing brother said the
[1:35:39] heroes of the Old Testament had Faith
[1:35:40] they put it into action you've got them
[1:35:43] for an example aren't you thankful for
[1:35:45] that he said now we've got faith but you
[1:35:48] won't put it into
[1:35:49] action but he said ride away on the
[1:35:52] powers of the Holy Holy Spirit I wonder
[1:35:55] if we could do that tonight as we bow
[1:35:56] our
[1:35:57] heads if you have a need on your heart
[1:35:59] tonight I wonder if you just just put
[1:36:01] your hand up right where you
[1:36:04] are sometimes I believe we we we live so
[1:36:07] below our privileges because we want to
[1:36:10] do something we want to work life out we
[1:36:13] want to make it when he's already went
[1:36:16] before us and made a way for
[1:36:18] us we just got to rest in his promises
[1:36:21] if you just pray right there where
[1:36:23] you're at just if you have something
[1:36:24] just go ahead and talk to the Lord right
[1:36:26] where you
[1:36:28] are he hears you he knows every
[1:36:32] need is more than able heavenly father
[1:36:36] as you see these people here tonight
[1:36:38] with their hands raised and their their
[1:36:40] heads bowed to
[1:36:42] you Lord there may be many in here who
[1:36:44] have failed to take you at your word and
[1:36:48] they've let worry overtake them they've
[1:36:50] let fear they've let anxieties and
[1:36:52] depression
[1:36:53] Lord we live in a time where everything
[1:36:55] is just against us but Lord You're
[1:36:57] greater than depression you're greater
[1:36:59] than anxiety you're greater than just a
[1:37:01] knowledge you're not an intellectual God
[1:37:03] but you're a God that we believe by
[1:37:05] faith and Lord I pray you would raise
[1:37:07] our faith tonight to where we would just
[1:37:09] rise up in the power and Lord I pray
[1:37:12] that you would give us wings like eagles
[1:37:13] to soar into the heavenlies here tonight
[1:37:15] and Lord when we leave this building I
[1:37:17] pray that we wouldn't doubt your word
[1:37:19] but we would believe that you are still
[1:37:21] more than enough for all of our needs
[1:37:24] you're more than able to take control of
[1:37:26] every situation Lord if it be a job we
[1:37:28] would need or if it need a car we would
[1:37:30] need and Lord if it would be a uh Lord
[1:37:32] if if our family is wward I pray Lord
[1:37:34] you would restore everything to us Lord
[1:37:37] and you're more than able to do it if
[1:37:39] we'll just trust and rest in you tonight
[1:37:41] I pray you would move upon this church
[1:37:42] Lord you see the sacrifice that they've
[1:37:44] made to be here tonight I pray you would
