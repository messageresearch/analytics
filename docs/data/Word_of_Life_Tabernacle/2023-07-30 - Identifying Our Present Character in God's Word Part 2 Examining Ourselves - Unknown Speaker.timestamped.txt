[45:51] and so let's go to Matthew chapter 7 and
[45:54] verse 1.
[45:56] judge not that you be not judged
[45:59] for with what judgment you judge you
[46:01] shall be judged
[46:03] and with what measure you meet it shall
[46:06] be measured to you again
[46:09] why behold us thou the moat that is in
[46:11] thy brother's eye
[46:13] but consider us not the being that is in
[46:16] thine own eye we found out last week
[46:17] that moat is a speck
[46:21] or a little bit grain of dust a splinter
[46:25] and the beam is like a rafter
[46:28] it's a log
[46:31] to the how will thou say to thy brother
[46:33] let me pull out the moat out of thine
[46:36] eye and behold a beam is in thine own
[46:38] eye
[46:39] thou hypocrite First cast out the beam
[46:42] out of thine own eye and then shalt thou
[46:45] See Clearly to cast out the moat out of
[46:48] thy brother's eye I pray the Lord would
[46:50] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[46:51] seated
[46:55] there was a saying during the French
[46:57] Revolution that the revolution eats its
[47:00] own children
[47:01] and what they meant by that is that
[47:03] insecure political leaders always have
[47:06] to have enemies because they're always
[47:09] they gained power through uh through
[47:13] means that were not exactly legal and so
[47:16] they always have to have enemies in
[47:18] order to because they're always afraid
[47:21] that somebody's going to take that power
[47:22] from them
[47:24] and so when the French Revolution the
[47:26] leaders of that gained power they began
[47:29] to eat one another in other words they
[47:31] begin to Guillotine one another they
[47:33] they begin to destroy one another and in
[47:36] doing that that it actually implodes on
[47:39] itself and they ended up with the King
[47:40] again and and losing everything that
[47:43] they had gained in that and all it did
[47:46] was was a bunch of Bloodshed and a lot
[47:47] of murder I'll say this I I pray that
[47:50] our message never comes to that where
[47:52] where people are just constantly
[47:54] devouring one another as we know that
[47:57] Paul said if you if you bite and he said
[47:59] if you're constantly biting one another
[48:00] take heed that you don't devour one
[48:03] another and so we need to be careful
[48:05] that we don't do that because if once we
[48:08] set ourselves up as the answer as the
[48:10] ultimate and we and we put no mirror on
[48:13] ourself we we have no ability to look at
[48:15] ourselves and and examine ourselves and
[48:18] see whether we're in the faith or not
[48:20] and so we're always looking at other
[48:21] people and seeing what they're doing
[48:23] wrong we've all met people like that
[48:25] sometimes we're like that and we need to
[48:28] turn the mirror on ourselves and be able
[48:30] to see what we're doing and what we need
[48:32] well we need to check up what we need to
[48:34] to be better at yeah
[48:36] and so during that Revolution that
[48:39] eventually no one was pure enough
[48:41] because it's the nature of of heresy or
[48:44] or something that's false it goes out on
[48:47] a limb somewhere eventually no one's
[48:49] pure enough and no one does it good
[48:51] enough and no one walks the road just
[48:53] like they want them to walk it and
[48:55] eventually they they just slay everybody
[48:57] and you don't have a church no more you
[48:59] don't have but remember God didn't call
[49:01] us to be perfect in in this flesh he
[49:03] called us to be mature children of Jesus
[49:06] Christ he called us to be filled with
[49:07] the spirit of God to be filled with the
[49:09] perfect one amen the word he's the only
[49:12] perfect one
[49:14] now but eventually the enemy even if
[49:18] it's of their own kind that's what they
[49:20] did during that Revolution they began to
[49:21] destroy each other
[49:23] and they could not see that the real
[49:26] problem was in the mirror
[49:28] oh God help us today
[49:31] this is why that a person filled with
[49:34] bitterness
[49:35] should never attack the object of that
[49:39] bitterness
[49:40] huh yeah right if you've got bitterness
[49:43] now I'm gonna just preach where we live
[49:45] this morning if that's all right
[49:47] a person with bitterness should never
[49:49] attack or should never judge or should
[49:52] never should never lash out at a person
[49:54] the object of their bitterness you say
[49:56] well I have some legitimate complaints
[49:59] but you can't complain legitimately they
[50:01] may be legitimate complaints but you're
[50:03] not complaining legitimately because you
[50:05] got a rafter in your eye you've got
[50:07] something you haven't forgiven you
[50:09] you've got things that just aren't right
[50:11] and and so you're not complaining
[50:13] legitimately about that person until you
[50:15] get rid of that being that bitterness in
[50:18] your own eye
[50:20] so he says he the person loses all
[50:23] ability both to see clearly and to help
[50:26] the brother
[50:28] oh my so now and again now if you did
[50:31] not have the ability to warn properly if
[50:34] you're warning you knew that you're
[50:36] warning somebody about something would
[50:38] only result in them doubling down would
[50:40] only result in them getting worse why
[50:42] would you do it in the first place
[50:44] yeah right but it's because it flows
[50:47] from a place of bitterness so this is
[50:48] what Jesus is talking about he's not
[50:50] saying well we shouldn't judge anybody
[50:52] in the sense that you can wear what you
[50:54] want to be go where you want to do what
[50:56] you want to and nobody should be able to
[50:58] say anything about it that's not what
[50:59] Jesus is saying at all he's saying
[51:01] before you comment on somebody else's
[51:03] life before you begin to talk about what
[51:06] some other church is doing you need to
[51:08] take a big mirror a full-length mirror
[51:10] right in front of you and be able to see
[51:12] what you are
[51:15] get the beam out of your own eye
[51:19] yeah very easy
[51:21] to turn the mirror of God's word on
[51:23] everybody else that's right
[51:25] that's right right it's very easy to
[51:27] take and look and say brother so and so
[51:29] here's what they're doing brother so and
[51:30] so here's what they're doing but what
[51:31] about me yeah
[51:33] what about our church
[51:35] how can we do better
[51:38] now
[51:40] I
[51:41] you just forgive me Church why is it
[51:44] that always our enemies that brother bam
[51:46] talks in identification about about
[51:48] identifying ourselves with a character
[51:50] in the word of God he said that was
[51:52] holding up a mirror to ourselves yeah
[51:55] right to do that why is it that we
[51:57] always identify our enemies as Balaam
[52:01] and us as Moses
[52:04] wait wait why can't I be I I said that
[52:06] one time why can't I be Moses once in a
[52:08] while you'd be Balaam you know
[52:11] why is it that the person that's always
[52:13] that that's making an enemy's list
[52:16] always is the good one
[52:19] right why are they always the good one
[52:20] and why are they always the one that
[52:22] don't make any mistakes and but that's
[52:24] just human nature that's just the way
[52:26] that we are but now you find that
[52:28] they're always Balaam they're always
[52:30] Micaiah and the person is always the 400
[52:34] prophets that they're against right and
[52:36] David they're always uh when they when
[52:39] they come to David and and the new cart
[52:42] they're always with Nathan and and David
[52:44] is always the one that's against that's
[52:47] uh the one that got it wrong and they're
[52:49] the other Church
[52:52] huh
[52:54] and so we always make our we always make
[52:57] Ahab the enemy and we're we're with
[53:00] Elijah
[53:01] I want to present a little bit different
[53:03] idea to you today
[53:05] first off Romans 14 and 4 said who art
[53:09] thou that judgeth another man servant
[53:11] Romans 14 and 4. who art thou the judges
[53:14] another man's servant to his own Master
[53:15] he standeth or followeth yea he shall be
[53:18] holding up for God is able to make him
[53:21] to stand
[53:22] right so now what he's saying is that
[53:25] there's there's something about we want
[53:27] to judge everybody else but we need to
[53:30] recognize that they answered to God not
[53:32] to us
[53:34] and it doesn't mean that wrong doesn't
[53:36] need to be dealt with it does need to be
[53:38] dealt with sometimes there is a
[53:40] situation we need to go against a new
[53:41] cart
[53:42] right or we need to speak to somebody
[53:44] who's going with the majority doing
[53:46] something wrong sometimes that situation
[53:48] is relevant
[53:49] but you better get the beam out of your
[53:51] own eye before you start judging
[53:53] somebody else
[53:55] right now look there's a little bit
[53:59] it's a little bit different maybe but
[54:00] there's a little bit of both in all of
[54:02] us
[54:03] a little bit of David and a little bit
[54:05] of Nathan a little bit of Balaam a
[54:08] little bit of Moses because we live in
[54:10] flesh
[54:12] we have a body soul in spirit so if we
[54:15] would correctly identify many times
[54:17] without any our actions we wouldn't just
[54:19] identify well these people are this and
[54:21] those people are that just like people
[54:22] do today well that's a Democrat that's
[54:24] the Republican that one's good that
[54:26] one's bad whichever side of the
[54:27] persuasion you fall on but if you can
[54:28] see beyond that and see the person
[54:30] themselves and and see you begin to
[54:33] realize there's good and bad right
[54:35] there's good and bad there's good and
[54:36] evil there's a True Vine and a false
[54:38] fine that don't mean we do away with the
[54:40] true church because there's a false
[54:41] Church there's going to be a true and a
[54:43] false there's going to be a mixed
[54:45] multitude in every Revival there's going
[54:47] to be a there's going to be a an
[54:49] unbeliever A make-believer and A real
[54:51] believer in every church but I would
[54:53] that every one of us would say Lord let
[54:54] me be the real belief
[54:56] instead of trying to identify all the
[54:58] rest of them let me be the real believer
[54:59] but I'll say this you have a
[55:01] make-believer and an unbeliever right
[55:03] here
[55:05] your flesh is an unbeliever
[55:09] your spirit is a make-believer
[55:11] but the soul
[55:13] is a Believer and that's why you
[55:15] struggle sometimes somehow you know
[55:17] what's right to do but you struggle
[55:19] doing it that's why Paul said oh
[55:20] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[55:22] me from the body of this death but what
[55:24] was it there was a Believer on the
[55:25] inside that's why you're here this
[55:27] morning there's a Believer on the inside
[55:29] that's why you're struggling for for
[55:31] truth that's why you're reaching out for
[55:33] something real there's a Believer on the
[55:35] inside
[55:38] no no
[55:40] don't assume your serpent seat
[55:43] because your flesh doesn't want God
[55:46] flesh never once God
[55:49] now look good
[55:51] good there's a little bit of both in all
[55:52] of us and some humility would help
[55:55] you recognize that
[55:57] the gospel works
[55:59] by self-examination
[56:02] without looking in the mirror this is
[56:04] important this morning not because I'm
[56:06] saying it but because it's God's word
[56:09] it doesn't work without self-examination
[56:12] we've got to be able to see ourselves
[56:15] that's why as we said last week
[56:17] sometimes it takes a minister takes a
[56:19] preacher to take the mirror of God's
[56:20] word they're not changing the mirror
[56:21] they're just taking and putting it
[56:23] squarely in front of us
[56:24] so we can see and sometimes it takes it
[56:27] takes a Ministry of God's word to stand
[56:29] there and put it right in front of us
[56:30] and so it's because we would hold it
[56:32] like this and we would put a little bit
[56:34] different where somebody else might we
[56:36] say well I look pretty good like that I
[56:38] I look pretty thin I like we said last
[56:40] week I look pretty good but if you could
[56:41] only have somebody else take the mirror
[56:43] and put it right in front of you you'd
[56:45] let you know it lets you know what you
[56:46] really look like
[56:49] but but in self-examination ultimately
[56:52] that that we have to do
[56:55] to to be able to make the gospel work we
[56:59] want the gospel to work don't we
[57:01] we don't want it just to be an idea
[57:04] God forbid that this message would be
[57:06] just an idea
[57:07] that what a prophet gave his life for in
[57:10] serving and doing all those things and
[57:12] and preaching to us 1100 tapes or 1200
[57:15] that they found and what he did over the
[57:17] years over the decades that all of that
[57:20] and then all the work that's been done
[57:21] since all the brothers and sisters that
[57:23] have gone on that have worked so hard to
[57:25] promote this message and bring it to the
[57:28] people and build churches and do the
[57:29] things they've done God forbid that we
[57:31] would just reach a place where where it
[57:33] didn't matter anymore it was just an
[57:35] idea it was just another Doctrine it was
[57:37] just another saying it was just
[57:39] something you something you were a part
[57:40] of like you were Jehovah's Witness or a
[57:42] Baptist or something else God forbid who
[57:44] he would fall to that but the message is
[57:46] a living reality
[57:48] it's a life that's lived it's not
[57:51] something that that you go that you are
[57:52] sent to this in your mind say well I
[57:54] believe it but brother that's not enough
[57:56] it's got to be a token that comes back
[57:58] on the believer
[58:02] so let's go to First Corinthians 11 28
[58:04] and this is a little bit odd because
[58:06] it's a communion scripture the Justin
[58:08] and I were discussing communion last
[58:10] night but I had this in my notes that
[58:13] because it talks about self-examination
[58:15] and we'll have communion next week the
[58:17] Lord willing next Sunday night
[58:20] but listen to what Paul says he said let
[58:22] a man examine himself
[58:25] let a man examine himself
[58:29] when you come to the communion table you
[58:31] don't examine your wife
[58:33] you don't examine your family
[58:35] you don't examine the preacher
[58:37] you don't examine the church
[58:40] you come by yourself
[58:42] and you examine yourself
[58:46] and so let him eat of that bread
[58:49] and drink of that cup for either eatest
[58:51] and drinketh unworthily
[58:54] eat us and drink his damnation to
[58:56] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[59:00] and watch
[59:01] it is self-examination that makes the
[59:04] body work properly yeah
[59:07] right so sometimes that's why you go see
[59:09] a specialist right if there's something
[59:11] wrong in your body you can go to a
[59:14] general a doctor a general practitioner
[59:16] but he's going to refer you to a
[59:17] specialist he's going to say you need to
[59:19] go to the hearts Festus you need to go
[59:20] to the lung specialist why does he do
[59:22] that because that person specializes in
[59:24] a certain part of the body because you
[59:26] need to examine that part in order for
[59:28] the whole body to be whole you're a part
[59:31] of the body you're not all of the body
[59:33] I'm not all of the body this church is
[59:35] not all of the body but we are a part of
[59:37] the body and in order for the body to be
[59:39] well oh we've got to examine ourselves
[59:43] again not my brother not my sister not
[59:46] my husband not my wife
[59:48] myself
[59:53] now watch
[59:54] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[59:57] among you
[59:59] and many sleep
[1:00:01] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:00:03] we should not be judged
[1:00:05] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:00:08] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:00:10] condemned with the world aren't you glad
[1:00:12] he loves you aren't you so glad he loves
[1:00:14] you enough that he doesn't let you go
[1:00:16] without it he'll he'll he'll cause you
[1:00:18] he'll cause conviction to come in your
[1:00:20] heart you'll cause things to happen in
[1:00:22] your life he'll bring you to him it's a
[1:00:24] tender hand of Jehovah moving you to the
[1:00:26] word of God
[1:00:28] brother random says what are you
[1:00:30] and this is in 1965 in communion he said
[1:00:33] you're a Christian you live before
[1:00:35] everybody as a Christian and if you take
[1:00:38] that and don't live as a Christian
[1:00:40] you're not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:00:43] you're putting a stumbling block in
[1:00:46] someone else's way
[1:00:48] now watch as they see you trying to do
[1:00:50] this and then not living what you're
[1:00:53] supposed to live brother random thought
[1:00:54] that communion was a showdown that you
[1:00:57] are you're presenting yourself as a
[1:00:59] Christian
[1:01:00] you're standing up there and saying I
[1:01:02] don't lie no more I don't steal no more
[1:01:04] I don't do those things say well I did
[1:01:06] that yesterday you repent first
[1:01:08] right and then you take communion
[1:01:10] but you're standing there it's you're
[1:01:13] examining you say I've examined myself
[1:01:16] and I'm a Christian
[1:01:18] oh my it's important
[1:01:21] because now he said if not you're
[1:01:22] putting a stomach in somebody else's way
[1:01:24] now watch
[1:01:25] if it's okay to take communion by
[1:01:28] yourself
[1:01:29] then this scripture is meaningless
[1:01:32] all right
[1:01:33] a quote that's meaningless it doesn't
[1:01:35] mean anything yeah
[1:01:36] because it wouldn't hurt the body
[1:01:39] for you to take communion if you didn't
[1:01:41] tell nobody
[1:01:43] and it defeats the purpose of communion
[1:01:45] brother said the first purpose of
[1:01:46] communion is fellowship yeah
[1:01:48] yeah right so now when you come together
[1:01:51] and you take to me the reason we do it
[1:01:53] publicly is because it's just like
[1:01:55] baptism we if we can we baptize people
[1:01:58] in front of as many people as we can I
[1:02:00] had a person request one time to be
[1:02:02] baptized privately
[1:02:04] and I'll say that the person was just
[1:02:06] shy but I told him if you can't be
[1:02:09] baptized publicly you probably shouldn't
[1:02:11] be baptized
[1:02:13] right because you really haven't buried
[1:02:15] yourself because baptism is a public
[1:02:17] show well so is communion it's showing
[1:02:19] that you're living as a Christian that
[1:02:21] you're part of the body so you don't
[1:02:23] have to discern the Lord's body to take
[1:02:25] communion alone right right but watch
[1:02:28] this when we take this he said it shows
[1:02:30] to the church that I believe every word
[1:02:33] of God how many say Amen to that today
[1:02:36] it shows to who it shows the church
[1:02:39] right I believe that he's the bread of
[1:02:42] life that come from God out of heaven
[1:02:44] believe every word he says is the truth
[1:02:46] how many can say Amen to that today
[1:02:48] I live by it to the best of my knowledge
[1:02:51] God being my judge
[1:02:54] therefore before my brothers before my
[1:02:56] sisters listen I do not swear I do not
[1:02:59] curse I do not do these things because I
[1:03:02] love the Lord and the Lord knows it
[1:03:04] embarrass me record
[1:03:07] are you with me now you're Discerning
[1:03:09] the Lord's body he said he said
[1:03:11] therefore before you I take the parcel
[1:03:14] of his body to know that I am not
[1:03:16] condemned with the world see there you
[1:03:18] are he said then it's a blessing
[1:03:21] I've known people who are always afraid
[1:03:23] to take communion I'm not preaching on
[1:03:24] communion this morning but just to give
[1:03:26] us an idea of what it means to examine
[1:03:28] ourselves I know people that all their
[1:03:31] life they're afraid to take communion
[1:03:32] they'll Miss communion service because
[1:03:33] they their heart condemns them all you
[1:03:35] got to do is make it right all you got
[1:03:37] to do is say to be covered by the blood
[1:03:38] of Jesus Christ and don't do it anymore
[1:03:40] walk away from it you say well I can't
[1:03:42] do that he'll help you do it
[1:03:45] yes sir he will heal you he will help
[1:03:46] you
[1:03:47] he will walk with you
[1:03:50] yeah that's good and then it'll be a
[1:03:52] blessing to you
[1:03:54] again he said the discernment of knowing
[1:03:57] that you are the Lord's body
[1:04:00] this is important
[1:04:03] you can't discern it in wickedness and
[1:04:05] sin
[1:04:06] we've got to be above that yeah he said
[1:04:09] that we discern that the Lord is
[1:04:11] righteous we discern how many have
[1:04:13] discerned today that he's righteous we
[1:04:17] deserve that he's our propitiation what
[1:04:19] are we doing Discerning the body well I
[1:04:21] love a prophet I love how he puts these
[1:04:23] things he said we discern he's our
[1:04:25] propitiation you see my brother Ben you
[1:04:27] failed lastly but I'm discerned he's my
[1:04:30] propitiation
[1:04:31] what that means is he took my place
[1:04:36] that all of our sins we've confessed and
[1:04:38] we believe in him of waiting upon his
[1:04:41] atonement to cleanse us from all our
[1:04:43] iniquity then we're Discerning the
[1:04:45] Lord's body to what it's discernment of
[1:04:47] what it's for right you're Discerning
[1:04:49] the body of the Lord is for me it was
[1:04:52] broken for me that blood was spilled for
[1:04:54] me he's my propitiation He's My
[1:04:57] Sacrifice
[1:04:59] Hallelujah
[1:05:01] and then he said Discerning again
[1:05:03] that in among us as the Lord's bride
[1:05:06] body let's discern if there's anything
[1:05:10] wrong with us in here that would hinder
[1:05:13] the gospel from growing or the Lord from
[1:05:16] presenting us before God as a chaste
[1:05:19] virgin
[1:05:20] now again not not Discerning your
[1:05:22] brother or your sister was there
[1:05:24] anything wrong in the church is there
[1:05:25] anything wrong with my brother is there
[1:05:26] anything wrong no when we come to the
[1:05:28] communion table the pastor deserves
[1:05:30] himself
[1:05:31] and the congregation discerns themselves
[1:05:34] the deacons discern themselves in the
[1:05:36] trustee no one is above this right
[1:05:38] we discern one another
[1:05:41] oh my and it brings us on an equal
[1:05:43] playing field
[1:05:45] because the ground is level at the foot
[1:05:47] of the cross there's no big eyes and
[1:05:49] little Hues but it brings us together
[1:05:52] before God
[1:05:53] look
[1:05:55] let's discern he says that out right now
[1:05:57] and find if it's wrong let's confess it
[1:06:01] if it's wrong let's say Lord I'm sorry
[1:06:04] about that
[1:06:05] so therefore there might be something
[1:06:07] that we've done you've done something
[1:06:08] I've done it might not be consciously
[1:06:11] right now let's ask God to forgive us
[1:06:13] for it or if we come to every service
[1:06:15] not just community
[1:06:17] service if we come that way
[1:06:19] yeah let me discern the Lord's body
[1:06:21] today let me discern what it means for
[1:06:23] me let me discern my place in it and
[1:06:26] what it would mean if if I was in some
[1:06:28] secret sin and it would hinder the body
[1:06:30] Lord let me be clean
[1:06:35] now the word examine
[1:06:37] means to approve after testing I like
[1:06:40] that
[1:06:42] to approve after testing
[1:06:44] so you don't just approve yourself but
[1:06:47] you test yourself first
[1:06:50] to see if you should be approved it's an
[1:06:53] old term comes from testing gold if we
[1:06:55] examine ourselves he says if we prove
[1:06:58] ourselves and then we test ourselves to
[1:07:01] see that we should be approved so we're
[1:07:03] not just approving because it's us
[1:07:05] there's some folks that the uh it's
[1:07:07] right because they said it we talked
[1:07:10] about that not long ago it's right
[1:07:11] because I said so but that's not the way
[1:07:13] we approach the gospel it's not right
[1:07:15] because I said it it's not right because
[1:07:17] some other person said it it's not right
[1:07:19] because your favorite preacher said it
[1:07:20] or somebody else said it's right because
[1:07:22] it's the word of God it's true the truth
[1:07:25] is it stands on its own yes
[1:07:29] now if we examine ourselves we won't be
[1:07:32] led astray we don't have to worry about
[1:07:33] being led astray you say brother Ben I'm
[1:07:35] worried worried that some preacher might
[1:07:37] deceive me
[1:07:39] and sometimes we you know even here in
[1:07:41] the Pulpit well I I don't let blatant
[1:07:43] false Doctrine here in the Pulpit but
[1:07:46] sometimes out of Brotherly Love we'll
[1:07:47] have somebody preaching maybe they
[1:07:49] preach something a little different from
[1:07:50] our idea
[1:07:51] maybe maybe it would be right or maybe
[1:07:53] be wrong
[1:07:55] I'm afraid of being deceived well let me
[1:07:59] rest your mind for a moment
[1:08:01] you know what the antidote to being
[1:08:03] deceived is
[1:08:05] to examine yourself
[1:08:09] the antidote to being deceived is not to
[1:08:12] examine the deceiver right
[1:08:20] listen to me I'm afraid I'm being
[1:08:22] deceived by people I'm afraid people are
[1:08:24] taking me uh taking me and they're not
[1:08:26] doing right by me examine yourself
[1:08:30] if you examine yourself you can't be
[1:08:33] deceived many times I spent 15 years in
[1:08:36] the Land Title industry and I had to get
[1:08:38] enough confidence in my own work that
[1:08:41] when somebody that had more experience
[1:08:42] than me maybe there was even an attorney
[1:08:44] or something like that that went to law
[1:08:46] school when they would try to tell me
[1:08:48] something was so but I had examined my
[1:08:50] own work to a point where I knew that
[1:08:53] what I did was right not because they
[1:08:55] said it was right but because it was
[1:08:57] just the right thing
[1:08:58] I had done the work myself I wasn't
[1:09:00] relying on some third party doing it I
[1:09:02] was relying on some other title company
[1:09:04] I examined it myself and I knew that
[1:09:07] this was the case and I had a confidence
[1:09:08] in my own ability in that to be able to
[1:09:10] do that listen that's the place we got
[1:09:12] to get as a Christian not that you
[1:09:13] examine every false Doctrine out there
[1:09:15] but you need to examine yourself and see
[1:09:17] am I a Christian am I in the word am I
[1:09:20] the bride he said the bride would not be
[1:09:22] deceived let me examine my own life and
[1:09:25] I'll see that there that there'll be no
[1:09:27] false Doctrine that'll be received by me
[1:09:30] are you with me so far
[1:09:33] damn in yourself are you are you weak
[1:09:36] unable you just follow everything that
[1:09:37] comes along
[1:09:39] about by every wind of Doctrine where's
[1:09:41] the doctrine will be there
[1:09:43] but examine yourself
[1:09:46] again we try so hard to make sure that
[1:09:47] what comes across the spoken is the word
[1:09:49] of God I'm a man and you need to
[1:09:51] remember that
[1:09:53] yeah
[1:09:54] if you don't remember it I'll remind you
[1:09:56] of it
[1:09:59] I fear there's some there's some some
[1:10:01] things I fear as a minister one of the
[1:10:03] things I fear is a minister
[1:10:05] getting mistaken for an absolute
[1:10:09] I am not the absolute what God Said is
[1:10:12] the absolute
[1:10:13] what God spoke is the absolute we went
[1:10:15] through that that's the absolute that's
[1:10:17] what we stand on what God Said
[1:10:19] and sometimes I speak what God said
[1:10:21] because I speak the word
[1:10:23] right but you have to discern yourself
[1:10:27] right and in order to take that word in
[1:10:29] because I'm a human being
[1:10:32] huh
[1:10:33] so is everybody else that you have
[1:10:35] respect for
[1:10:36] the dangerous place we get to a place we
[1:10:38] just accept whatever somebody says
[1:10:40] because of who they are yeah
[1:10:42] you're you're in danger of deception at
[1:10:45] that point
[1:10:47] because you just accepted it because oh
[1:10:49] he's the pastor he must be right he he's
[1:10:51] somebody I respect I've seen him over
[1:10:53] the decades over the years but that man
[1:10:55] could be as wrong about that as anything
[1:10:56] else because he's subject to error
[1:10:59] brother random said that Joseph was the
[1:11:01] most perfect type of Christ that there
[1:11:02] could be they said God let him make one
[1:11:04] mistake
[1:11:05] when he lied and and they said that what
[1:11:08] they lied about what they were he said
[1:11:09] let him make one mistake they're in
[1:11:11] Egypt
[1:11:12] in order to show us that it wasn't him
[1:11:15] it wasn't Christ every man makes
[1:11:18] mistakes but we're covered by the blood
[1:11:20] of Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that
[1:11:22] today we're covered by the blood
[1:11:28] now Paul the Corinthians weren't sure
[1:11:30] that Paul was telling them the truth are
[1:11:31] you okay this morning I'm taking this
[1:11:33] kind of slow but I just want to drive it
[1:11:35] home
[1:11:36] as we're building where we want to go
[1:11:38] this morning
[1:11:39] in second Corinthians 13 3 said since
[1:11:41] you seek a proof of Christ speaking in
[1:11:44] me which to you word is not weak but is
[1:11:47] mighty in you so he's saying it ought to
[1:11:50] be proof enough that what I've said
[1:11:52] resulted in you becoming Christians
[1:11:56] right the word working ought to be proof
[1:11:59] he said for though he was crucified
[1:12:01] through weakness yet he liveth by the
[1:12:03] power of God now watch he what he's
[1:12:06] saying is it's mighty in you he said for
[1:12:08] we also are weaken him but we shall live
[1:12:10] with that with him by the power of God
[1:12:11] towards you so they had accused Paul of
[1:12:14] being weak
[1:12:15] they had accused he said well he's only
[1:12:17] got one code he keeps getting thrown in
[1:12:18] prison he keeps getting beaten up and so
[1:12:21] by natural standards he was weak the
[1:12:23] same accusation comes to the message of
[1:12:25] the hour today people said well the
[1:12:26] bride is weak the people are weak
[1:12:28] there's all kinds of trouble that's what
[1:12:30] they said about Israel too but they
[1:12:32] didn't see a Brazen serpent they didn't
[1:12:33] see it they didn't see a shot of the
[1:12:35] king in the camp
[1:12:36] they couldn't see those things
[1:12:38] but they said Paul you're weak your
[1:12:41] ministry is over
[1:12:43] and he wrote back he says I examine
[1:12:45] yourselves
[1:12:46] oh my if you want to know whether what
[1:12:50] I'm telling you is the truth
[1:12:51] examine yourselves whether you be in the
[1:12:55] faith
[1:12:55] prove your own self know you not your
[1:12:59] own selves how that Jesus Christ is in
[1:13:01] you attempted to be reparation I love
[1:13:02] how Paul turns it right back on him he
[1:13:04] says don't examine me or my Ministry he
[1:13:06] said that's been evidently proved among
[1:13:08] you examine yourself
[1:13:10] right
[1:13:11] he said just examine Yourself by the
[1:13:14] word the random speaking he said by the
[1:13:16] message
[1:13:17] examine Yourself by the message examine
[1:13:20] what a real Christian should be rugged
[1:13:22] loving and we're going to get down where
[1:13:24] we live now
[1:13:26] he said not one of this modern
[1:13:27] Christianity it's soft flexible half
[1:13:30] dead rotten inner bread
[1:13:34] just quote
[1:13:38] he said see it's not real Christianity
[1:13:41] live any kind of way and belong to
[1:13:43] church
[1:13:44] he said don't you want that sweet
[1:13:45] fellowship with Christ
[1:13:49] I don't want to hurt you this morning
[1:13:51] that's not what I might my aim is to do
[1:13:53] but I want you to have that sweet
[1:13:55] Fellowship in Christ
[1:13:57] and you're not exempt from living right
[1:13:59] because you go to Word of Life
[1:14:00] Tabernacle or you claim to believe in a
[1:14:02] prophet or because you've been in a
[1:14:03] message for 50 years there's still got
[1:14:05] to be a communion between you and God
[1:14:07] don't you want that sweet fellowship
[1:14:09] with Christ
[1:14:11] he said the Holy Spirit the Conformity
[1:14:13] of your own heart to the word
[1:14:17] oh God help us today okay can't you can
[1:14:20] we just tune out everything else for a
[1:14:21] little bit and examine ourselves by
[1:14:23] prophet's words
[1:14:25] can we just do that for a moment could I
[1:14:27] encourage you to do that
[1:14:29] he said as I told you a while ago listen
[1:14:31] to what I say
[1:14:33] oh God
[1:14:35] listen to what I say listen close he
[1:14:38] said Look Back Down examine yourself
[1:14:40] with the word and see where you're at
[1:14:45] yeah you said you women that's got short
[1:14:46] hair let her grow
[1:14:48] you're wearing shorts take them off act
[1:14:50] like a lady you mean still smoking
[1:14:52] cigarettes running the pool hall stop it
[1:14:54] he said I don't care how much you
[1:14:55] profess if you're still holding that
[1:14:57] organization and saying this is it and
[1:14:59] this is it he said you better stop yeah
[1:15:01] come on now
[1:15:03] you got your faith in your organization
[1:15:05] instead of in Christ
[1:15:07] brother Brown said if you were a
[1:15:09] Christian and we're part of the Catholic
[1:15:10] church he said if you put your faith in
[1:15:12] Christ you'd still be saved
[1:15:14] but if you put your faith in the church
[1:15:16] you'd be lost
[1:15:18] could we could we bring that up to today
[1:15:20] because you go to Word of Life
[1:15:22] Tabernacle does not mean that you're
[1:15:24] saved listen to me young people listen
[1:15:26] to me children because you go here does
[1:15:28] not mean that you're saved
[1:15:31] you've got to have a personal
[1:15:32] relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:15:34] if you're still holding that
[1:15:36] organization and saying this is it and
[1:15:38] this is it you better stop look back
[1:15:40] down examine it with the word
[1:15:42] he said we ought to have lived above the
[1:15:44] short hair and all
[1:15:46] come on he said this age now we're back
[1:15:48] into something now that God is revealing
[1:15:51] the Hidden Mysteries had been put on the
[1:15:53] book before the foundation of the world
[1:15:54] and those who have obeyed in these small
[1:15:57] things
[1:15:59] there's a reason why there's no
[1:16:01] Revelation when you find the people who
[1:16:03] are disobedient in the small things
[1:16:06] there's no Revelation why is there no
[1:16:08] revelation God won't honor it yeah
[1:16:10] he said those who have obeyed in these
[1:16:13] small things will catch it in these
[1:16:15] other things
[1:16:17] oh my you thought it didn't mean nothing
[1:16:19] because you lived for God and treated
[1:16:20] your business associates right and
[1:16:22] didn't run people down and didn't talk
[1:16:24] about them and didn't gossip and because
[1:16:26] you lived a Godly sincere life you
[1:16:28] thought well I'm not much of a Christian
[1:16:29] but you didn't realize you were
[1:16:31] preparing yourself for the revelation of
[1:16:33] the Rapture in our hour
[1:16:35] by doing that you're preparing yourself
[1:16:37] to receive from the message you could
[1:16:39] not receive from it if you weren't
[1:16:40] obedient in these little things
[1:16:43] he said if they haven't it'll go over
[1:16:45] the top of their head as far as the East
[1:16:47] is from the West haven't we seen that
[1:16:49] brother Joel how many times people that
[1:16:51] are disobedient in small things it goes
[1:16:52] right over the top of their head
[1:16:55] they're unable to catch it yeah
[1:16:59] see we must look in the mirror and
[1:17:01] discern our position in Christ
[1:17:05] where do we sit
[1:17:07] where does the bible say that we sit
[1:17:08] today
[1:17:10] we sit in Heavenly places in Christ how
[1:17:13] many know that today Ephesians 2 60th
[1:17:15] raised us up together
[1:17:17] and made us to sit together together
[1:17:20] right yeah in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:17:24] Jesus he has raised us up into Heavenly
[1:17:28] places Heavenly atmospheres
[1:17:30] now brother Brown says this he said do
[1:17:32] you get what I mean he's talking about
[1:17:33] that scripture he said that we are dead
[1:17:35] that you already raised with him that's
[1:17:37] the earnest of our Salvation we're
[1:17:39] sitting together in Heavenly places he
[1:17:42] said Look Back to the places you come
[1:17:44] look what's going on
[1:17:46] examine yourself take inventory
[1:17:50] take you ever seen them do an inventory
[1:17:52] in a store
[1:17:53] I'd walk around with a machine counting
[1:17:55] every little item why did they do that
[1:17:57] because if you leave the little things
[1:17:59] off
[1:18:01] make a profit yeah
[1:18:03] right you have to inventory every item
[1:18:05] because the it's the little foxes that
[1:18:08] spoil the vine so he said we should take
[1:18:10] inventory again that's not the job of
[1:18:12] anybody else but our own job
[1:18:15] come on now it's not our job to sit as
[1:18:18] judges of our brothers and sisters
[1:18:21] huh come on to watch as they come
[1:18:24] through the door
[1:18:26] we won't preach for a minute and get
[1:18:28] back to it
[1:18:30] and look at them and say well their
[1:18:31] dress is too short
[1:18:34] it's not our job examine yourselves
[1:18:39] well there
[1:18:41] I'll tell you what that sister last week
[1:18:42] she was a blonde
[1:18:47] examine yourself
[1:18:50] are you hearing me today tell me
[1:18:51] yourself hey well
[1:18:53] brother so and so I I saw his truck down
[1:18:57] at the place I heard a story about the
[1:18:58] man that this woman kept telling stories
[1:19:00] about where he had parked his truck
[1:19:02] overnight and she just kept she just
[1:19:04] wouldn't wouldn't be quiet and so he
[1:19:06] finally took his truck and parked it
[1:19:07] outside her house and left it
[1:19:13] that'll stop it
[1:19:17] examine yourself
[1:19:19] well brother brothers so-and-so would
[1:19:22] would do a better job when he come in
[1:19:24] and had a better attitude than we all
[1:19:27] would would do better examine yourself
[1:19:33] examine yourself this doesn't work by
[1:19:36] examining each other
[1:19:38] it works by examining yourselves
[1:19:40] examining heart cells
[1:19:43] he said look what's going on take
[1:19:44] inventory see have I bypassed his word
[1:19:48] I know the Bible says that but I don't
[1:19:51] believe it that way
[1:19:52] be careful he said you're not dead yet
[1:19:55] if the Holy Spirit was in there he would
[1:19:58] say amen that's my word
[1:20:01] well I believe the days of Miracles has
[1:20:03] passed you do and the Bible said he's
[1:20:05] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:20:08] I believe that the science of Mark 16
[1:20:10] was for another generation you do and he
[1:20:12] said these signs shall follow them that
[1:20:14] believe how far to the end of the world
[1:20:16] oh I'm with you always and the works
[1:20:18] that I do so you do also how long to the
[1:20:21] end of the world examine yourself
[1:20:23] examine what you believe
[1:20:25] what do you believe about the message of
[1:20:27] the hour what do you believe I tell you
[1:20:29] what it's a good thing when you lay your
[1:20:30] head down on your pillow at night
[1:20:31] brother Jeff you've examined yourself
[1:20:33] and you say I may not be I may not have
[1:20:35] been the best person I may not have done
[1:20:37] all of everything right but I've
[1:20:38] examined my life and I've been covered
[1:20:40] by the blood of the Lamb I believe the
[1:20:42] message of the hour not because my
[1:20:44] church teaches it but because I believe
[1:20:46] it there ain't no internet going to sway
[1:20:47] me there ain't no there ain't no person
[1:20:49] outside going to sway me I know in whom
[1:20:51] I have believeth and I'm persuaded that
[1:20:54] he's able to keep what I've committed to
[1:20:55] him against that day do we have anybody
[1:20:57] like that in here this morning you say I
[1:21:00] know and whom I have believed I know I
[1:21:02] believe the message of the hour I know
[1:21:04] I'm a Child of God examine yourself it's
[1:21:07] not to beat you up it's not to make you
[1:21:09] feel bad examine yourself so you know
[1:21:13] so you can have a smile in church once
[1:21:15] in a while so you can believe so you can
[1:21:17] live for God so you can walk with him as
[1:21:19] the children of the father he said he
[1:21:21] don't want you to be frowned he don't
[1:21:22] want you to be unhappy he wants you to
[1:21:24] live before him like children
[1:21:26] oh my
[1:21:30] yeah
[1:21:31] it's difficult to examine yourself
[1:21:33] but it's good for you
[1:21:35] but the parent talks about the castor
[1:21:37] oil you all know the story he said that
[1:21:39] you support castor oil down with us it
[1:21:41] was km
[1:21:46] remember the km Where's Becky you
[1:21:48] remember the km Becky's back there she
[1:21:50] is over there
[1:21:52] the km we had this bottle it was a
[1:21:55] miracle drug it wasn't a drug it was it
[1:21:57] was oil is what it was it looked like it
[1:22:00] tasted like like engine oil don't ask me
[1:22:03] how I know that
[1:22:06] had that consistency if you drank a cup
[1:22:08] every day you were going to be all right
[1:22:10] but it was nasty
[1:22:12] it was awful I can still taste it
[1:22:15] it was awful but they said it worked so
[1:22:18] we drank it I'll say as long as I drank
[1:22:20] it I never went to the doctor
[1:22:22] maybe that's what happened that's
[1:22:26] it was km it said it was a miracle it
[1:22:29] worked and so we took it not because we
[1:22:32] enjoyed it but because it was good for
[1:22:35] its
[1:22:37] oh are you with me today we got
[1:22:39] something it's not made up by some quack
[1:22:41] somewhere it's not some story or some
[1:22:43] marketing tool but we've got a word that
[1:22:45] you can live by that's been examined by
[1:22:48] God himself he swore by him himself he
[1:22:50] proved his own word and he took the
[1:22:52] toxin himself and he said it works
[1:22:54] because you I live you live also oh
[1:22:57] could we oh that ought to give us
[1:22:59] something to shout about this morning
[1:23:01] because I live you live also the works
[1:23:03] that I do so you do also
[1:23:06] taking it and it works
[1:23:09] it may be hard but it works
[1:23:12] brother benefit I think that's the way
[1:23:13] with preaching the gospel if it don't
[1:23:15] stir you up a little bit get feel your
[1:23:17] spiritual gastronomic started right make
[1:23:19] you a little sick to examine yourself
[1:23:21] with the Bible
[1:23:23] see if that old temper and selfishness
[1:23:25] ungodliness love of the world television
[1:23:27] and things at night leaving the church
[1:23:29] said empty the Pew said empty
[1:23:32] how can people not be convicted by that
[1:23:35] but we live in an age where there's no
[1:23:37] conviction because nobody preaches it
[1:23:38] but I want to I want there to be one
[1:23:40] place in the world but the bill where
[1:23:41] people still preach the gospel whether
[1:23:43] it's still a preacher preaching it and a
[1:23:45] People receiving it lest there be one
[1:23:47] place in the world I believe there's
[1:23:48] more than that but let there be at least
[1:23:50] one
[1:23:51] and we never fail to hear the gospel
[1:23:54] preach across the pulpit yeah
[1:23:57] leave the church empty
[1:23:59] and you ought to be out there like Jesus
[1:24:00] he said you got his spirit in you time
[1:24:02] to get everybody in the country to come
[1:24:04] to your church to receive Christ you say
[1:24:06] brother Ben your meetings were full is
[1:24:08] packed out must be must be something
[1:24:10] wrong with it nonsense
[1:24:14] the preacher preached that the other day
[1:24:16] and just
[1:24:18] God help us
[1:24:19] what are we coming to
[1:24:21] it's nonsense because everybody wants to
[1:24:23] come it's nonsense I'll say this we're
[1:24:26] pretty small
[1:24:27] we're too small to fuss
[1:24:31] too small to divide
[1:24:34] you can only divide so many times before
[1:24:35] you cease to exist
[1:24:38] you're not a body anymore God help us
[1:24:40] today
[1:24:41] God help us to put up with one another
[1:24:43] yeah
[1:24:46] God help us to examine ourselves well
[1:24:48] because everybody comes that makes it
[1:24:49] wrong nonsense
[1:24:53] I would that every person would come
[1:24:55] that's what a prophet of God said
[1:24:56] we call ourselves in the bride of Christ
[1:24:58] what a Pity friend
[1:25:00] I'm just reading quotes
[1:25:03] the bride is Washed by the Water of the
[1:25:06] word here
[1:25:07] what she examines herself makes herself
[1:25:09] ready because she does not stand before
[1:25:11] the white Throne judgment
[1:25:13] aren't you glad for that
[1:25:14] because in the in that light brother Ben
[1:25:16] talked about that evangelist and stood
[1:25:18] in that light and he said I could think
[1:25:19] of things that I had done but we will
[1:25:21] not stand before the wife don't judge me
[1:25:23] yeah
[1:25:24] why will we not stand there and have
[1:25:26] every little bit of our life examined
[1:25:28] because we're judged here
[1:25:30] we're judged here that's what church is
[1:25:33] for that's what a preacher is for that's
[1:25:35] what the body is for
[1:25:37] yeah we judge ourselves
[1:25:40] under the atmosphere of the word under
[1:25:42] the preaching of the word under
[1:25:43] listening to the tapes under under the
[1:25:45] messenger of the hour under all of those
[1:25:47] things we are examined by the word yeah
[1:25:50] we do not hold the mirror to ourselves
[1:25:52] and say well I look pretty good but we
[1:25:54] let the word of God be itself
[1:25:56] and stand before us with no with with no
[1:26:00] filter and say let me look squarely in
[1:26:02] the word and if I won't look at it
[1:26:03] squarely maybe somebody there to hold it
[1:26:05] that'll put it right in front of me
[1:26:07] declare to me the word of God
[1:26:13] Paul says no you're not that we shall
[1:26:15] judge angels
[1:26:16] how much more things that pertain to
[1:26:18] this life
[1:26:19] we've got to learn to judge righteously
[1:26:21] and we can't do that Jesus said before
[1:26:23] we judge ourselves first
[1:26:26] the death doesn't change who we are only
[1:26:28] change is our dwelling place and we know
[1:26:30] that today
[1:26:31] Moses and Elijah will still be prophets
[1:26:33] brother Branham taught us on the other
[1:26:34] side
[1:26:35] he said the Jews only believe their
[1:26:36] prophets and come forth with a sign of
[1:26:38] the prophets and their work will be that
[1:26:39] of the Prophet for they did exactly he
[1:26:42] said showing one thing
[1:26:44] he said that man when you die or
[1:26:47] whatever when you leave this world your
[1:26:49] nature doesn't change
[1:26:50] listen now if you're a liar now you'll
[1:26:53] be a liar there
[1:26:55] if you're a hot-headed here you'll be
[1:26:57] headed there
[1:26:59] if you're a doubter here you would be a
[1:27:02] doubter there
[1:27:03] men and women it's time to shake
[1:27:05] yourselves to examine yourself see where
[1:27:08] we're standing for death does not change
[1:27:10] it
[1:27:12] whom I Paul says wherefore lift up the
[1:27:15] hands which hang down and the feeble
[1:27:17] knees make straight paths for your feet
[1:27:19] you know if I've got to examine if I've
[1:27:21] got to examine myself what is what is
[1:27:23] the church for well the church provides
[1:27:25] me a place to do that and an atmosphere
[1:27:27] to do it in and then the church is there
[1:27:29] for support the church is not there to
[1:27:31] push me down the church is not there to
[1:27:33] keep me back in the pit but the church
[1:27:35] is there to lift me up he said if
[1:27:37] there's any weak among you let him be
[1:27:39] supported by the people let him be
[1:27:41] supported by the church by the ones that
[1:27:43] are strong if you think you're strong he
[1:27:45] said take heed lest you fall and make
[1:27:47] sure that you support those that are
[1:27:49] weak
[1:27:50] make straight paths for your feet oh
[1:27:52] that's what we want to do this morning
[1:27:53] let's sat with this let him be turned
[1:27:55] out of the way but rather be healed
[1:27:57] follow peace with all men and Holiness
[1:27:59] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:28:01] looking diligently looking diligently
[1:28:04] because the one thing we don't want
[1:28:07] bitterness to come in and divide us
[1:28:10] looking diligently lest any man feel of
[1:28:13] the grace of God that's any root of
[1:28:15] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[1:28:17] thereby many be defiled unless there be
[1:28:20] any fornicator or Pro profane person as
[1:28:22] he saw or for one morsel of meat sold
[1:28:24] his Birthright
[1:28:26] examine yourself for a root of
[1:28:28] bitterness
[1:28:29] why is the root of bitterness a problem
[1:28:31] because that root produces fruits of
[1:28:33] bitterness separation brother Brown said
[1:28:35] organization breeds hatred
[1:28:39] it destroys Fellowship yeah it makes
[1:28:42] bitterness
[1:28:44] when we lose our love
[1:28:46] when we lose our reason for going to
[1:28:48] church it just becomes organization and
[1:28:52] organization breeds hatred you want to
[1:28:54] know if something's a denomination or
[1:28:56] not you want to know if it's got a
[1:28:57] denominational mindset we know there
[1:28:59] won't be a denomination made out of the
[1:29:00] Bride but there's many mindsets for that
[1:29:02] as many spirits of that around and if
[1:29:04] you want to know something's like got
[1:29:05] that denominational mindset does it
[1:29:07] breed hatred does it breed division
[1:29:12] it makes bitterness that's what myrrh
[1:29:14] means what Smyrna was full of
[1:29:16] bitterness
[1:29:18] root of bitterness defiles many so more
[1:29:20] and more defilement was coming in yes
[1:29:22] yes that's what happens with the root
[1:29:24] once the root comes up if it gets to
[1:29:26] spread
[1:29:29] oh God let me not be a root of
[1:29:31] bitterness I'm examining myself this
[1:29:33] morning
[1:29:34] help me Lord not to be a root of
[1:29:36] bitterness standing in the pulpit
[1:29:38] come on now that would defile many
[1:29:40] because who could defile more than a
[1:29:42] pastor yeah
[1:29:44] who took a root of bitterness
[1:29:46] and begin to preach in bitterness to the
[1:29:48] people
[1:29:49] who could defile more than someone who
[1:29:52] calls themselves a Christian
[1:29:54] who had a root of bitterness who had a
[1:29:56] bad experience and so they treat
[1:29:58] everybody like their dirt
[1:30:04] I'm not gonna preach all day I promise
[1:30:11] the bitterness was coming up in every
[1:30:12] age with Philip scarves you realize that
[1:30:14] root of bitterness and our lives every
[1:30:17] generation if the Lord terries fulfill
[1:30:18] the scars of that
[1:30:20] believe it I've said this before don't
[1:30:23] be in a situation that makes you hate
[1:30:25] somebody yeah
[1:30:27] yeah if you have to get out of that
[1:30:28] situation get out of it before you hate
[1:30:29] people yeah
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:32] don't don't stay in that
[1:30:34] deal with your own Spirit first then go
[1:30:36] back and help your brother yeah
[1:30:39] we know that every seed or promise of
[1:30:41] God will bring forth of its kind
[1:30:43] every promise will oh I'm so glad for
[1:30:45] that I don't want to root of bitterness
[1:30:47] I want a seed of God growing inside of
[1:30:50] me the word of God growing inside of me
[1:30:51] he said what it promised if it strikes
[1:30:53] the right ground the ground is prepared
[1:30:54] ready all the Rocks has been thrown out
[1:30:56] the roots the bitterness selfishness
[1:30:58] indifference jealousy has all been
[1:31:00] grubbed out that root of bitterness that
[1:31:02] Springs up that's sometimes so spoils
[1:31:04] the thing that God is trying to do we
[1:31:07] pray God that that won't be among us but
[1:31:09] that the good word will find good ground
[1:31:10] in these
[1:31:12] examine ourselves I'm not pointing this
[1:31:14] at anybody else to this morning God
[1:31:16] forbid that I would do that let's
[1:31:17] examine ourselves
[1:31:20] and see if the fruit we're producing is
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:22] examine Yourself by what a prophet said
[1:31:25] or the light that's shown on the word
[1:31:27] for the hour
[1:31:29] brother said now you've got tapes on
[1:31:30] that you've got tapes on what we believe
[1:31:31] you got tapes on discipline in the
[1:31:33] church how we behave ourselves in the
[1:31:35] Church of God how we got to how we got
[1:31:37] to come here together and sit together
[1:31:39] in Heavenly places
[1:31:41] don't stay home if God is in your heart
[1:31:43] you can't hardly wait for them doors to
[1:31:44] open how you honor you all know this but
[1:31:46] I I just it's just on my heart this
[1:31:48] morning let's make sure that that root
[1:31:50] doesn't come come in and begin to spread
[1:31:52] out it's not important anymore it is
[1:31:54] important
[1:31:55] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:31:57] brothers if you don't feel that way I
[1:31:58] tell you it's time you got to pray and
[1:32:01] yeah he said because we're in the last
[1:32:02] days where the Bible exalted or assorted
[1:32:04] us to much more as we see that day
[1:32:06] approaching to love one another with
[1:32:07] Christian love and divine love to
[1:32:09] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[1:32:11] places in Christ Jesus and love one
[1:32:13] another
[1:32:14] by this will all men know that you're my
[1:32:16] disciples when you have loved one for
[1:32:17] the others I try to stay right together
[1:32:20] it's a brother you think he's a little
[1:32:22] wrong with her sister say Lord don't let
[1:32:24] me never have the root of bidder to
[1:32:25] spring up
[1:32:27] listen if that person's already bitter
[1:32:29] it doesn't help for you to become bitter
[1:32:31] too
[1:32:37] it's got a text this morning from
[1:32:38] somebody a good brother good good
[1:32:40] brother in another state another
[1:32:42] area of the country

[1:33:18] it a priority

[1:33:25] times

[1:35:21] that stuff
[1:35:24] there's answers for those things
[1:35:26] yes come get it come talk about it yeah
[1:35:29] yeah that's what we're here for
[1:35:33] if you think he's a little wrong he said
[1:35:35] that root of bitterness brings up he
[1:35:36] said it'll affect him
[1:35:37] and it'll take the Christ right out of
[1:35:39] my life
[1:35:41] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[1:35:44] and hatred
[1:35:46] brother Caleb I just found a use for
[1:35:48] Schrodinger's cat
[1:35:53] talking about that theory last night you
[1:35:55] know if a cat's in a box I think I think
[1:35:56] I mentioned that to you before the cat's
[1:35:58] in the box and there's a there's some
[1:36:00] kind of radioactive material in the box
[1:36:01] and it's going to kill the cat but once
[1:36:04] he's in the Box you don't know if he's
[1:36:05] alive or dead so he exists both alive
[1:36:07] and dead at the same time that's a lot
[1:36:09] but
[1:36:11] that's the theory anyway he's a Quantum
[1:36:13] cat
[1:36:14] he lives in Two Worlds at the same time
[1:36:18] you realize that if those poison acids
[1:36:20] are in you unchecked
[1:36:25] you're already dead
[1:36:27] you don't know it but maybe just a
[1:36:29] little thing and it just come out but
[1:36:31] you don't realize if you don't arrest
[1:36:32] that if some because if things exist in
[1:36:35] a constant state of flux until something
[1:36:36] changes until they become reality you've
[1:36:38] got to have there's got to be reality to
[1:36:40] forgiveness or you will go the wrong way
[1:36:44] you're already dead and you don't
[1:36:45] realize it yeah
[1:36:48] foreign
[1:36:49] acid will just take the Holy Spirit
[1:36:51] right away from you to run in from the
[1:36:52] Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of
[1:36:54] God drive it away from me or hurt your
[1:36:55] pastor it'll do everything don't you do

[1:37:54] your possession
[1:37:56] it fails do we have that Pentecostal are

[1:38:10] the trumpets are sounding Now's the Time
[1:38:12] to examine yourself
[1:38:14] the trumpet of God's word the message of
[1:38:16] the hour
[1:38:17] have a certain sound
[1:38:23] I know we're the elect of God
[1:38:26] I know we're the predestined of God
[1:38:28] sometimes the elect predestined bride of
[1:38:31] Jesus Christ
[1:38:32] is to check up
[1:38:35] and see that that he has given us he's
[1:38:37] given us so much hasn't he
[1:38:39] that none of that has been lost
[1:38:43] yeah see the woman in Luke 15 and 8. you
[1:38:45] bought had 10 pieces of silver brother
[1:38:47] Brandon said she was she was engaged to
[1:38:49] be married
[1:38:51] and during that time the 10 piece of
[1:38:53] civil represented 10 virtues but Brown
[1:38:55] said you find that in Galatians 5. he
[1:38:57] said it's the fruits of the spirit and
[1:39:00] then he adds one he said brotherly
[1:39:01] kindness yeah
[1:39:04] he emphasizes brotherly kindness yeah
[1:39:07] he said what woman having 10 pieces of
[1:39:09] silver if she lose one piece
[1:39:11] now say well one piece it'll be all
[1:39:13] right no it would
[1:39:14] because those were her virtues and if
[1:39:17] she was caught not staying with those
[1:39:19] virtues then the priest would take one
[1:39:21] out and she knew if her husband to be
[1:39:24] came home and saw her
[1:39:27] without those without that engagement
[1:39:29] ring on without all pieces all the
[1:39:31] silver in that piece that he would just
[1:39:33] he would he would divorce her for the
[1:39:35] random sin
[1:39:36] so she could not remain in that
[1:39:37] condition so what did she do she didn't
[1:39:40] sit there and say well bless God the
[1:39:42] neighbor down the road Musta must have
[1:39:44] must have stole it during the night
[1:39:47] well if they hadn't had that meeting I
[1:39:49] would be happy
[1:39:52] now it consumes me yeah
[1:39:56] yeah if they if they were doing
[1:39:58] everything right like they should a
[1:39:59] bunch of Pentecostals
[1:40:02] or us looking back the other way well if
[1:40:04] that church down the road wasn't so dead
[1:40:05] we'd be all right
[1:40:08] it didn't matter what piece they were
[1:40:10] missing
[1:40:11] are you with me now
[1:40:13] it doesn't matter what piece all 10 of
[1:40:14] them had to be there
[1:40:17] and he said if she lose one piece does
[1:40:19] not lie to candle and sweep the house
[1:40:21] and seek diligently till she find it
[1:40:25] oh my she had to sleep diligently and
[1:40:28] when she'd found it she called her her
[1:40:29] friends and her neighbors together
[1:40:31] she said let's have a meeting
[1:40:33] Rejoice with me I have found the peace
[1:40:36] which I lost this area has lost too much
[1:40:38] brotherly kindness when we find it let's
[1:40:40] call the people together and have a
[1:40:42] meeting how about it when we find it
[1:40:44] let's call some people together we've
[1:40:46] lost way too much over the years of the
[1:40:48] virtue we were supposed to have as a
[1:40:49] bride when we signed it let's come
[1:40:51] together and rejoice
[1:40:54] yeah
[1:40:55] good the church better be examining
[1:40:57] theirself brother said by the word of
[1:40:59] God are Purity our loyalty our devotion
[1:41:02] he's talking about this woman he said
[1:41:04] we've become paddlers tail bearers
[1:41:05] cigarette smokers backbiters painted up
[1:41:07] Jezebels everything in the calendar the
[1:41:09] rest of the world does the Christian
[1:41:10] church is associating those things today
[1:41:12] that you can't hardly tell the one from
[1:41:13] the other it's time we took inventory
[1:41:15] it's getting late
[1:41:17] he talked about the candle in the broom
[1:41:19] he said now in order it was so late so
[1:41:21] she had to light a candle and she got a
[1:41:22] candle not only did she get a candle but
[1:41:24] she got a broom and she went to house
[1:41:26] cleaning she didn't go down the neighbor
[1:41:27] and clean their house she didn't go down
[1:41:29] to the to the temple and clean out the
[1:41:30] temple she was cleaning her own house
[1:41:34] she got a broom and she went to Houseman
[1:41:35] little brother if there ever was a need
[1:41:37] of time of the lighting of a candle the
[1:41:39] sending forth to Gospel Light the Holy
[1:41:40] Ghost back into the church he said not
[1:41:43] so much for emotion not for some
[1:41:44] Fantastics not for some emotional
[1:41:46] workout not for a jump for joy that's
[1:41:48] wonderful but that's not why we clean
[1:41:50] the house
[1:41:51] but for a heart searching experience
[1:41:53] when men and women get right with God
[1:41:56] and you'll have a jump for joy you'll
[1:41:58] have them you'll understand
[1:42:00] one against that
[1:42:01] but he said that's not what it's for
[1:42:06] you need to have a time when you clean
[1:42:07] the house
[1:42:09] I'd be lost to be told who they are and
[1:42:11] hold you the bride of Christ that's
[1:42:12] wonderful I believe in that try to tell
[1:42:14] you that everyone your kids need to hear
[1:42:15] that yeah
[1:42:18] also need to hear if there's something
[1:42:19] missing or

[1:42:29] brother Joel I'll be it'll be all right
[1:42:32] brother every little candle in here
[1:42:33] ought to be lit tonight not only that
[1:42:35] but she got the broom and the neighbors
[1:42:37] could see the dust flying
[1:42:39] she had a real house cleaning time for
[1:42:41] her husband was about to come and if he
[1:42:44] caught her with that one coin out she
[1:42:46] was a harlot

[1:42:48] God in these great hours that we're not
[1:42:50] living it behooves us to check up go
[1:42:52] before God light the candle of the word
[1:42:53] and the gospel examine ourselves and
[1:42:55] find out if we're not falling short
[1:42:56] especially when we see all these things
[1:42:58] coming we're at the end time the coming
[1:43:00] of Christ is at hand there's not another
[1:43:01] hope in the world for the church and
[1:43:03] look the church that's all he the church
[1:43:05] has no conscience no more you can hardly
[1:43:06] wake them up come on now
[1:43:09] yeah
[1:43:10] musicians go ahead and come I'm gonna
[1:43:12] have to stop
[1:43:14] listen I was I got put under Thursday
[1:43:18] got put under
[1:43:20] and you know one my only concern with
[1:43:23] the thing they were doing they were just
[1:43:24] running the test but my only concern
[1:43:25] with doing that but Bill is I want to
[1:43:27] make sure I was asleep
[1:43:30] all right
[1:43:32] you do not want to know what they're
[1:43:35] doing and they were putting a tube down
[1:43:37] my throat
[1:43:38] I don't want to know that because I'm
[1:43:40] going to try to reject that
[1:43:43] put me to sleep
[1:43:45] so the last time I was under anesthesia
[1:43:47] was probably eight years ago
[1:43:49] and I come under anesthesia again sister
[1:43:51] million when they when they put me under
[1:43:52] anesthesia you know I can feel it but it
[1:43:54] ain't it ain't knocking me out
[1:43:57] you know I'm relaxed I can't move
[1:44:00] but I can move I can barely talk and I
[1:44:02] begin to talk and I
[1:44:04] said doc
[1:44:06] I said I'm not he's like and I can hear
[1:44:09] him talking they say is he is he asleep
[1:44:12] it's easy out because the doctor was in
[1:44:13] a hurry
[1:44:15] ain't nothing worse than a doctor in a
[1:44:17] hurry
[1:44:19] and I could hear myself say
[1:44:21] I'm still awake
[1:44:24] and I said I'm a big boy give me some
[1:44:27] more
[1:44:32] but I was I was saying I'm awake but
[1:44:34] really I wasn't
[1:44:36] I couldn't feel a thing in fact they put
[1:44:37] that tube down my throat before I
[1:44:39] completely conked out I couldn't feel a
[1:44:40] thing I couldn't know a thing I was out
[1:44:43] but I thought I was awake
[1:44:45] that's where the people live today
[1:44:47] that's where Abraham told us in the
[1:44:48] coming of the lord they're living that
[1:44:49] state where they can hear
[1:44:51] they hear voices they hear a prophet's
[1:44:53] voice they hear something else over here
[1:44:55] they hear they can see the coming of the
[1:44:56] Lords at hand they know they can see
[1:44:58] life they can see she told me before
[1:44:59] they did it I said you might see lights
[1:45:01] you might hear voices she said but
[1:45:02] you're okay but I just couldn't buy into
[1:45:04] that I want to make sure I was asleep
[1:45:08] but but but I hear that I could hear all
[1:45:10] these things but I couldn't do nothing
[1:45:14] that's where so many people live and
[1:45:16] brother bear said the Bible said they
[1:45:17] would come in that condition where they
[1:45:18] say Lord our Lord delays his coming
[1:45:19] they'd be devouring and biting one
[1:45:21] another so if we're fighting around it's
[1:45:23] just exactly that hour everything's
[1:45:25] ready the Patriots just turned as it was
[1:45:27] like that and it's ready the coming of
[1:45:28] the Lord he talked about all the
[1:45:30] churches that lost their life and talked
[1:45:32] about how the house cleaning time come
[1:45:33] he said and he said this he said now she
[1:45:36] had a house cleaning time she scrubbed
[1:45:37] the floor She swept the walls she took
[1:45:39] down the cobwebs she kept on until she
[1:45:41] found what she had lost and when she did
[1:45:43] she called her little sister churches to
[1:45:45] come now he said I don't care if you're
[1:45:47] a Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[1:45:48] Presbyterian come let us rejoice
[1:45:50] together we Haul Hallelujah by the
[1:45:54] message of the hour by the Light of the

[1:45:59] come Rejoice with us come let us rejoice
[1:46:02] together when that time comes when the
[1:46:04] church Finds Its brotherly love he said
[1:46:06] when the church Finds Its holy decency

[1:46:09] Christ it'll call to the other members
[1:46:11] of the body come Rejoice with us God
[1:46:14] wants the church to love him oh my do
[1:46:16] you love him today
[1:46:18] he said about this you'll know that all
[1:46:20] men will know each other disciples
[1:46:21] because you love one another
[1:46:24] yeah how can you love a god whom you
[1:46:25] have not seen if you can't love your
[1:46:27] neighbor but you have seen yes

[1:46:48] back tonight
[1:46:50] I don't want to point this at any
[1:46:51] individual
[1:46:52] I want you to examine yourself as I'm
[1:46:54] examining myself today
[1:46:58] hard
[1:47:00] let me get the light of the message I'm
[1:47:01] tired of I'm tired of my family being
[1:47:04] backslided
[1:47:05] I'm tired of not being able to rejoice
[1:47:07] in the house of God
[1:47:09] tired of everything else taking
[1:47:11] preeminence over the word of God help me
[1:47:13] to sweep Lord

[1:47:32] Assurance of my faith if you're not sure
[1:47:35] what you believe you're you're kind of
[1:47:37] wild you're just not sure that the
[1:47:38] message is right you can be sure today
[1:47:40] you can be sure you don't have to live
[1:47:43] in that constant state of of negativity

[1:48:06] brother Brown Blitz said I believe in
[1:48:08] altar calls he said but it's not the act
[1:48:10] of coming to the altar he said it's
[1:48:12] after submission he said when you raise
[1:48:13] your hand even he said you defy gravity
[1:48:15] by raising your hand
[1:48:18] but could we do that this morning maybe
[1:48:20] you could raise your hand and say by the
[1:48:21] band today I'm going to examine myself
[1:48:23] no one else looking around
