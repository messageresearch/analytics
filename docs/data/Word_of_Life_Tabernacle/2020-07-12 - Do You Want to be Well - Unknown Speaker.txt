so grateful to be in your house again this morning and what a wonderful presence we feel here Lord Holy Father that in this presence that your word can come clear Lord in our lives and Florida can just bathe this down and allow us to be washed by the water of the word we thank you for it Lord father I pray that life would come forth and every hard and he would be completely doing things Lord according to your word I pray God if there's one sick this morning or one in need I know that your God your Jehovah Jireh you're able to meet that need by your word this morning and I pray that it would be so open us up Lord don't don't let us become stiff and starchy but lord help us to recognize what you're in our midst Lord and react to that respond to that Lord pray that you grant it thank you for all that you do we give it to you in Jesus name man god bless you you may be seated just for a moment I want to thank all of you for being so kind to us you'll notice my family is not here again this morning but the quarantine for them ends tomorrow and so we'll finally be out of that and you've been so kind and some of you have dropped off things at the house and done things for us like that and I really appreciate that you don't know how much that means to me and and if I don't get the chance to thank each one of you individually thank you for what you've done and for your prayers during this time and like we said Wednesday night we come out and got the head of Goliath and we've overcome this we we know what it's like to do battle and Paul said I fought the Beast at Ephesus but I've been there and the fact that I'm still alive means that God still heals and he still delivers and we're so grateful for that and grateful for his presence in our life and him doing what he does I wanted to say congratulations about the Caleb and sister Sophie not here this morning but with their baby and being born and so if they watch this congratulations and to them little Henry I believe his name is and we're always grateful Lord adds to the church the way he wants to so but no that's a wonderful time for them and then next Sunday just so everyone knows next Sunday we're going to have communion the Lord willing at 3 o'clock so we'll have a service at 10:00 our regular service at 10:00 and then communion 2 3 we won't have foot a foot washing service at this time we couldn't think of a way to do that and do it obey the rules of social distancing and things that we need to obey we will do foot washing again in the future we're not cutting that out but we're just gonna do communion this time next Sunday at 3 o'clock brother Darrell Ward was thinking about being able to be here but something come up for him and you pray for the Evangelist out there and the minister say they don't already know what to do their schedules are all messed up and you schedule something and then cancels I've had to cancel on ministers they've had to cancel on me and I know every church is like that every church is going through that because it's just hard to have a meeting right now and so pray for those brothers that are having to go through that and having to try to figure out what they're gonna do and and for those brothers overseas that are used to having missionaries come and people come to help and that's just not they're not able to do that right now but we know there's got to be a purpose for that so be praying for them but again communion next Sunday at 3 o'clock and but no foot washing there's a church survey is what I called it but there's a piece of paper out there in the foyer near the offering baskets and if you will take one of those and fill it out and what all that it is is some questions about what you'd like to have in the church and this is your church right this is not brother Ben's church this is your church you go to church here and and so there's some questions on there about the carpet and whether or not we should replace it and if so what color that you'd like to have and about the pews whether or not we should replace the pews and I'm not asking you for money we have the money to do it right now if we wanted to do it but it's just a matter of knowing what to do and and so that it would be helpful to the brothers and to me if you kind of put your input in and again it's your church and it's not a vote there's nothing binding but it just lets you be able to do that and also I put a question on there about service on Sunday night and if we have it should we have it if not or if so what time would be best for you and we'll try to get an idea again not a vote will have to do as we feel led to do but but I just want to get your input on it and God bless you and doing that thank you in advance for doing that for us again we're not asking for money but we would like to do some things and we like to you to be part of that all right let's stand together this morning do you love the Lord amen I trust that you do was so thankful that we're able to gather together this morning and have this good congregation here and some others that are unable to come that are watching this morning so we're grateful for that John chapter five and verse one start reading in verse one and we'll read down through verse eight good to have my brother here again this morning and I know he had a rough night their air went out and I ended up getting up at 3 o'clock in the morning electricity went out and they come to church so I know he didn't probably want me to tell that but but I appreciate that and and it means something and I'm sure God will reward them for their for their dedication to that and for you as well all of you that come Satan fights you to keep you out of the house of God we know it's good for you because of how hard he fights you to keep you out of here so we're gonna do everything we can to have church whenever we can and there'll be times things will come up but we know that God is faithful and we'll be able to meet together again amen John chapter five and verse one after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep market a pool which is called in Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind all withered waiting for the moving of the water angel went down with a certain season into the pool and troubled the water so ever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole whatsoever disease he had and I want you to think this morning how disappointing that must have been to the rest of them because just the fastest one to be able to get down there was healed and no one else so in verse five it says a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years Jesus saw him lying knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto Him wilt thou be made a hole wilt thou be made a hole the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool while I am coming another step is down before me and random talks about this how that he was able to walk able to get up but he just wasn't able to get down fast enough jesus saith unto Him arise take up thy bed and walk Amen let's approach the Lord one more time Heavenly Father I'm so grateful to be in your house again and father I pray that you'd move me out of the way this morning and speak us I know you want to you've done so many times before thank you for it we pray in Jesus name Amen amen to ask a man you may be seated to ask a man who was waiting at the Pool of Bethesda if he wanted to be well it's like asking a person in the drive-thru line at McDonald's if they want to eat I was in Walmart the other day and and there were several kids going through there about my kids age with fishing poles and they were coming out the door and I almost turn around to him and said are you going fishing that would be the reason why you bottled you know it and and so it almost seems silly to us that Jesus would talk to man who'd been sick for 38 years and he knew that the Bible says he knew how long he'd been sick and he approached him by the salmon you talked to him he said do you want to be well wilt thou be made whole and he's not just saying do you wish to be well or you hope to be well but if you go back and look at the original word its are you in earnest of being well Jesus appeals to the energy of his will do you have a desire a strong desire to be well to behold and we know that this man was predestined by God to have his healing we know this because Jesus said in John 5:17 he said my father worketh hitherto and I work and verse 19 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth there also do it's a son likewise you can't get a better model of election of predestination than this man sitting among five or ten thousand people he's sitting among the multitude and he sees there and all the people are around surrounding this pool this disappointing pool which is a type of denominationalism that they're sitting there waiting on a revival waiting on something to happen here comes Christ himself walking among them when he comes down and walks among the people he begins to walk through pass little babies that are crying and and bout to die he walks past lame people and blind people and many impotent folk as the Bible says but he was he did not heal any of those he did not he did not touch any of those but he he winds his way through the crowd unnoticed by the multitude and speaks to a man who didn't know he was coming and had no idea that he would be healed that day and he speaks to him and says do you want to be well 30-man and every one of us could look back at our own life or the JD and see that there was a time when God his way through the crowd and he made his way in our generation through through family and through people and through others that maybe were worse off than we were but he comes to our town he comes to our family he comes to our church whatever that it is and he said do you want to be well here's a message that you can be well here's a word that you can follow it you can be whole amen aren't you grateful for God's election today so he was predestined to that and and brother Branham says notice him we found a man laying on a pallet that would walk and he said to him wilt thou be made whole wide that one I thought a lot about that but the Bobby wide that one now watch he said he'll tell you Jesus knew this man had been there in this time you see all these years he healed him he told him to take up this bed and go home and he did in other words we saw a vision he entered he the father showed him that this man would be well so it takes predestination to be what we are in and here this morning you you have to have that election in your life but I want to tell you today that and I know you know this but I want to remind us I feel like the Spirit wants to remind us today that you cannot be healed saved or delivered unless you want to be many times in dealing with people that you know maybe you've got it family that's addicts maybe you've got family that's out in the world and they become addicted to substances or things like that and you deal with people like that and it it seems like that there's very little movement in their lives they say they speaks the right things they they tell you they want to be right and they tell you they want to quit drink you know JD they want to quit smoking they want to do all of these things but there's just no will there to do it it seems like and when they J that they're telling you the truth they don't intend to go back and but something just keeps pulling them back they just can't seem to be delivered but there's got to be a strong desire that God places in them to want to be well or they can't be and we have to be careful that we don't take and look at our own failure look at it as a failure of ours because it was not a failure of Christ being who he was that he passed all of those other people it was not a failure of that we look at our family we want so badly to help we look at people around us we want so badly to be able to help them but it's not a failure of that but it's gone choosing who he will and all we can do is offer the gospel to them all we can do is is offer them help and we should and we should as I said go after that one with the one that's lost from the fold the one the ninety and nine are safe let's go after the one but when we go we have to remember that our part is just setting the line it's just reading the gospel we can't make them sheep so you cannot be healed saved or delivered as you want to be the maniac in Portland could not be delivered it could be bound but he could not be delivered because there was no desire there but the bound says that the police said is that man dead I said no sir said he's He healed I said no sir he worships that spirit see he'd bring it right back to him because he thinks listen he's right if you ever want to be delivered if you ever want to be saved if you ever want to be healed you've got to recognize that you're not right jesus said the sick not or the whale don't need a physician but the sick do and that's why sometimes kids will leave and they get to a certain age and they're leaving why in the world but after a while they realize I'm sick I need what my parents had I need what the church had I need what that I was exposed to as a child they have to realize sometimes that they're sinners and that has to come to you whether you go out in the world or whether you stay in the church it's got to come to you got to recognize that you're a sinner and you need gray and so that where does that desire comes from come from if you have it today you're blessed by it where does it come from Romans nine eleven it says for the children being not yet born neither haven't done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger remember this is Isaac and Rebekah in and they're both godly parents both have their faults with their godly parents and elders shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated no but the rabbit says he hated Esau and loved Jacob before either boy was born for his foreknowledge allows him to predestinate all things to work together to his glory he said that's the great Jehovah it isn't him that Willis there he that run it's this God that show us mercy he said that's what the scripture says so it isn't how much you try it's how much God has done for you if you've got enough of God let's do this to come out here tonight a desire to come hear the message you ought to be the happiest person in the city hey man if you got an F of God to come out and hear the message of the hour you ought to be the happiest person in the city because God is moving in your life he's trying to lead you to the fountain he loves you oh do we believe that this morning then we shouldn't give up we said well my life is such now we shouldn't give up because if you have a desire He loves you now this elective love manifested itself in Jacobs life in an overwhelming desire I hope you get this this morning election is not a dormant thing it's not something that just is there and it's separate from who you are election manifested itself in such an overwhelming desire for the things of God and for the best thing and for the birthright that Jacob when he was in his mama's womb and he was about to be born grabbed hold of the heel of Esau we know that selection because he could never even think to do that he couldn't it wasn't a plan that he's inside the womb sitting there thinking well you know when I come out I'm gonna grab hold so I'll be named Jacob and and then later on I'll get the blessing know all these things seem to happen almost by accident they happened to him seemed seemingly randomly but what happened was there was an overwhelming desire even as a baby to change his status and in doing that he made many mistakes but the desire was still there and the desire come from God so was a desire to attain to a higher status than what he was born to and every Christian the Stuart has to come to that that there's a desire or heart that we want to be more than what our flesh is we want to be more than what our weaknesses are we want to be more than what we were born in sin shapen in iniquity come in the world speaking lies but I want to attain to a status of a son or daughter of God so if I'm going to attain to that status there must be an overwhelming desire that God places in my heart I never sought God I can't seek God the condition of man you look at the world today they're not seeking God for the most part man doesn't seek God he wants to worship but he just he worships anything who worship a tree or or anything a worshiper Clare job but but there's something in you that wants the real God wants the Living God who put that desire there he did amen so there's an overwhelming desire and yet that desire lays dormant in our lives and this man had been there for 38 years and maybe for much of that he'd been at the Pool of Bethesda and said in his denominational circle or maybe his message church and sit there and and every time there was a revival or a movement of the Spirit of God he tried he attempted it but he just couldn't make it to the water for 38 years he struggled with it and you would think at the end of that 38 years that he would have gotten to a point where he was desperate but actually what happens is we get used to things and the man must have gotten used to his condition and he says well I would go but before I can get there somebody gets there ahead of me I would go to church but every time I do something happens so it must not be meant for me I would I would pray but every time I do it doesn't see my my prayers were answered so it must not have been for me and so Jesus comes to him but Robert in that conditioner says do you want to be well are you ready to shake yourself out of your complacency and realize what you're doing that you just lived with this all of your almost all of your life you've lived with this problem and for 38 years you sit there and and and thought well it must just not be for me see he hung around he headed up society to hang around but Jesus still had to awake that desire it is hard to say do you ought to be well been you really want to be well do you want to be well bad enough to do what it takes to be well you see says if you want to be well pick up your bed on the Sabbath day which is a bigger thing than we think and walk with it if you want to be well do something that your denomination recognizes as wrong believe something that the people around you will look at and say he's a sinner he's not right if you want to be well acknowledge that the word Christ was the word in flesh acknowledged that the word is true if you want to be well pick up your bed on the Sabbath day and walk it's might get a little heavy for a minute but I want you to bear with me because really wonderful the grace of God to us but you know we live in a day where we want no obstacles between us and mercy we want free grace we want a heaven with no entrance requirements where if you go and you're a drug dealer go on in if you go if you're a prostitute going in but see Jesus wants to save the drug dealer in the prostitute but he can't go in that way revelation 22 and 14 tells us there's some requirements that blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life and that word literally is authority over the tree of life may enter through the gates into the city without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie these don't make it in C it doesn't matter what you were you may have been a dog or a sorcerer whoremonger a murderer an idolaters or you may have loved and made a lie but no matter what you were but you have to be clothed in the wedding garment you see when they come into the wedding in Matthew chapter 22 the Bible says that the servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and the king come in to see the guests because the logs remember that were invited didn't come so he goes to the Gentiles and he goes out and he he calls me and he calls you the ones who didn't maybe have a right to be there but we would come and so he come and he called us the bad and the good and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he says unto Him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless he didn't have an excuse because if he'd come through the door you can't come to Christ without receiving the token receiving the Holy Ghost without you can't be you may come and assimilate around all the other people but you won't have the wedding garment on and he says he was speechless since that the King to the servants bind him hand and foot take him away cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few were chosen he said I'm willing for anybody the bad and the good to come but they must put on the wedding garment they must come to the door over the last 25 or so years the new type of churches was created which identified itself as seeker sensitive seeker sensitive and and that's why so many churches changed their names you could grab by a church it wasn't Assembly of God Church for many years and all sudden it's got a new name it's because they want to be seeker sensitive they don't want to say anything maybe somebody had a bad experience that is Assembly of God Church so they'll just make up a name that would be harmless so I was driving the other day and I saw a church that said the name of the church was the brand-new church not sure I want to go to that church and I'm not sure how often they'll have to change their sign because it won't be long it won't be the brand-new Church but the point is that they don't want to offend nobody you want to late let down to where everybody could come regardless of you wouldn't be suspicious that it might be Pentecostal or Baptist or whatever you wouldn't know so they want to lower the obstacles to people for people to come and and the problem with that is that there's no biblical precedent for it none at all and so that kind of Church in when it they're talking about that kind of a church and I saw this in a news article they talked about this certain church instead of Sunday service to this park their apiece ession part stand-up comedy routine part live concert this is not your grandmother's idea of church it's how PBS newshour began their recent segment on new Abbey Church in Pasadena California this church is called an LGBTQ affirming Church so it's not just accepting but affirming Church shows a stand-up comedian who opens for a female pastor who talks about her life to a crowd of hipster congregants and the church was founded by a pastor who left a large evangelical church when he realized why young people weren't coming he said they didn't find it relevant to their needs I hate to break this to you but that's not why we go to church we go to church because God deserves to be worshipped we go to church because the word is true we go to church because God's Word works in our life but and so they said well if it doesn't meet your needs if the content in this man says if the content of what is preached doesn't meet the needs of the people you have to change the content but what we're telling you is that the content of the gospel will never meet the needs of the majority it will meet the needs of the elect and it'll meet the needs of whosoever will but it won't meet the needs of the majority look you see the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship is seeker-sensitive you ever thought about that when you're someone when you're a boyfriend some of you have to think back many many years but if you are a boyfriend or a girlfriend you had a crush on somebody you'd want to do everything you could to make sure that you didn't offend them it's seeker-sensitive right and so you always show up and your breath is clean and your hair's combed in and you've got the flowers with you every time and you're you try to get this girl to have an interest in you or this boy have an interest in you and in that situation the girl can say hey if you don't make me happy I'll find someone who will and the church today it's like wanting to be a girlfriend to the word if the world makes me happy as long as it keeps bringing me flowers as long as it keeps as long as it keeps coming by on certain times and healing and doing what it I'm okay with it but if it ever crosses me we're done the church today says make me happy heal me guarantee heaven Jimmy or I'll find happiness somewhere else and all the time Christ the word it's looking for a bride looking for a wife he's not looking for a girlfriend he's not looking for just somebody to bring flowers to he's not looking just for somebody but there's a deeper relationship beyond just showing up and and say well I'm so glad God showed up today no way it's a communion that you have with somebody that you love somebody you have a relationship with you'll say if I don't find my happiness here in the world I'll find it somewhere else no it's II don't want someone who brings flowers till he brings flowers to him Saturday night but he wants someone to be flesh from his flesh bone of his bone power of his power hey man he wants somebody to be the Lord that's why I sent the message in our if he wanted us just to be like everybody else why would he bother sending the message why bother having a bringing elijah at the end time if he doesn't want us to be different he wants somebody who will fulfill the the bride type in this hour to be the bride of Jesus Christ listen Jesus told the woman at the well but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him you don't want to just be their boyfriend you don't want to just be somebody who shows up now in the end but he seeks such to worship Him amen he's looking for a worshiper he's looking for somebody who he's in a relationship with somebody who will obey his word somebody will stay right there with him you see you have to want that kind of a relationship the spirit and the bride the Bible says come say come and let him that heareth say come so we find herself identified with that as we've heard before let him that is athirst come where the Spirit of the bride are speaking come and then whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely so every was able to take advantage of that but even they even those who will not be in the bride have to want to be saved and it's got to be a desire strong enough to overcome the obstacles that God of the house to be placed between us and mercy now hear me the desire to serve God must be strong enough that it will overcome the obstacles that God allows to be placed between you and mercy so that if you find yourself in a situation like job where you're serving God doing everything right and God says I'm gonna let Satan take the hedge around about him out from around about him and I'm all that Satan attack his body and attack his family and attack him financially and he'll still serve me he'll still serve me that's the kind of person God wants that's the kind that the bride is a man that's the son or daughter of God you see God places obstacles when in front of the mercy the throne of mercy when John saw the throne in heaven he saw four beasts surrounding the throne the first beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf and it's in Revelations 4 7 the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts as we know or the four standards of the tribes of Israel that were guarding the mercy seat in the wilderness they were guards around said their regards to the mercy seat he taught us that you can go and I won't read the quotes I had some of them in here I took them out to save time but you can go back and look at Revelation chapter 4 Revelation chapter 5 go and listen to those those messages that brother Brandon preached he taught that Matthew 28:19 was a guard to acts 2:38 in Matthew 28:19 says baptize them in the name of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost it doesn't say anything wrong but it backs up acts 2:38 but what it does is it takes the majority of the church world today is baptized wrong reading the same Bible that we why because God put an obstacle there so that only those that were elected would see it are you with me now those and it's plain it's right there brother Ram said you wouldn't even need a revelation to see that and yet 99% of the church wall doesn't teaches and so the person with revelation we say well that's he said the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost that makes sense makes perfect sense Peter wouldn't know the first time that God ever had a church on the earth they wouldn't have done it wrong so it makes sense that that Peter under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit would would repeat what Jesus said but do it in the right way but now people don't understand that the carnal mind wrestles with it and this is what Jesus is talking about a Luke 10 21 when it says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank the old Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that that was to hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight so when the Gentile woman come to the word come to Christ seeking healing the South Phoenician woman for her daughter Jesus said it's not right to give the children's bread to dogs where the branch says in perseverance which he takes from the text there were in the Bible or it talks about the South Phoenician woman he said this woman here our little Greek friend and we have here before us he said when she arrived at Jesus like Jesus would arrive here with us tonight we arrive and he comes here improves here he is among us well she thought that settled it see she had much difficulty brother Ram talked about that getting to him when she got to him she said well that settles it he said that don't settle it no sir that's when you begin to fight he said that's when you just start your real battle when she arrived at Jesus and Jesus said he was not set to her race and how many times do people start coming to the house of God and coming to church and when they first come they feel that the president god of the people are friendly and it's nice and everything's going good and maybe three or four weeks later you see them start to miss church sometimes and you see them start to go back out you see them go from the front to the back and then out the door and you begin to wonder what what's going on and in her life and you begin to realize that but a Joe they they had come to the word and then the word offended them a little bit they begin to find out wait a minute this isn't like the Baptist Church this doesn't like the Pentecostal church I have their standards that have to be met and it's not a legalism but it's it's an expectation of the word in my life that if the word is working certain things will take place and so you see some that will hold on and some that'll stain become real Christians and others will go right back because they were caught in the net but there was nothing in there no real desire because the word become an obstacle to them and now this woman arrives to Jesus and Jesus said he was not sent to her race but the man who said still she held on he said I like that hold on to it she was perseverance she was not a hotbed plant had to be baby no sir she was not a hybrid article like a big part of the crop today you didn't have to beg her and say now sister I'll tell you I would encourage you to go on he said no sir there wasn't nobody there to encourage her even Jesus himself tried to discourage her he said now I feel like holy rollers sure enough even Christ himself standing there trying to discourage her but she held on she had arrived at something she knew it Ben Allen and she said Lord you're that's true that's true whatever you say it's true but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table when naman came to Elijah's house he left disappointed because the lie she says okay you want to be well do you want to be well go to Jordan dip seven times and the man says wait a minute I got fifty rivers better than that one why do I have to go to that one he starts to leave and this servant told him said hey if he'd asked you to done a big to do a big thing you'd have done it but he asked you to do a small thing go go go nup dunk yourself in a in a muddy river it's a small thing it's just a little thing but he asked you to do it and so he said okay I'll I'll do it and when he goes he dips himself seven times he comes back clean why did he have to go to Jordan he had to want to be cleaned when they a blind man came to Jesus actually Jesus was walking along and sees him and his disciples say was this man born blind or was it his parents or what was it that caused this who sinned because he was born blind he said who sinned him or his parents and Jesus said neither one of them but he said this was done that God might give glory so he comes up to him and and he spits on the ground there's a strange thing for a preacher to do talk about breaking kovat requirements right there he goes spits on the ground makes the the clay muddy picks it up puts it on his eyes what a strange thing to do and he puts the mud on him and he said go wash in the pool of Siloam which means sent and he never led him there he just sent him away now but the brand picks that up and he says go to the pool of Siloam and wash so what was its face to contact see as soon as he could find the pool he said well which way to the pool of sent you could imagine he's blind Jesus didn't tell him where it was he just said go to Siloam he was since he's blind he's wandering around he's walking around the area and he's blind he's he's trying to see could someone help me if someone help me say well what do you need I need to get to the pool of Siloam well there's the pool over here no he told me to go to the pool of siloam well there's something else sir there's one that's a whole lot closer no he said he told me to go to the pool of siloam and he says why do you want to go to the pool he says it doesn't make any difference help me get to the pool cuz I know when I get to the pool brother man typed it this way said somebody help me to the meeting let me get in the presence of God I realized God has revealed to me the word has told me that if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover so I've got to get to the pool help me get there you've been there at some point in your life you know what that's like to to felt that the behind is coming and you're groping in darkness but the word speaks to you and says if you could just get in the presence of God if you could just get into a place where God can speak to you again and so the word tells you that and and you have to follow the word it may look stupid you may have mud all over your eyes but if he said go to the pool of Siloam that's the only place I can be I hope you hear me today you have to hit the wall to be well you had to want it bad enough but he groped through the darkness until he found the pool where are you going you know what I mean he said you wouldn't go over that bunch would you will just help me get over there that's all I want to know get me there and think spiritually now because no certain church but it's getting me to where Jesus is let me get into its presence I mean let me come to the Shekinah the word has told me that if I go and loss shall be well the word has told me that there's a place where Christ is living in people he said that's all I want to know get me there said I like that get me to a bunch of people where I can see the Bible live where I can see Christ living in the people give me amongst that group help me to get over to the pool of fent hey Ben and as soon as I said well here you are some kind lady or something another come by got him in her hand took him over to the pool say old fellow here's the pool why is it oh I've just got the Word of God that told me when I washed I'd see and it might be difficult it might it might be struggles there might be obstacles and even the very word itself was an obstacle the word said you've got to go find the pool the word said you you're not gonna be well until you go now Jesus could have spoken he could have been well but he had to had to want to be well and so he stumbled out through the city looking for the pool but he was at a single mind and a single heart that he was gonna reach it he said I've got the Word of God that told me when I wash that seat well my eyesight came to him and then he come back rejoicing it was the pool for him oh I remember when I found that pool can you remember can you remember when the word directed you to that place and you found that pool and you found a place where there was healing you found a place where you can see you've found a place but you had to obey the word to get there and brother Adam tells us that for obedience to the word entitles us to the token it's not how much you jump and how much you shout how much you cry but it's when God when he puts that mud on your eyes he says go to the pool you go to the pool people wait on something to happen something supernatural and they don't realize if they just obey the word there's healing but you got to obey the word there's there's restoration or salvation but you've got to obey the word you can't come to God and bring your your limitations and bring your expectations to God and say God I'll come if this is man I'll come but you gotta take me as I am no God don't do things like that he said you come my provided way in Matthew chapter 3 when John was preaching his message the wilderness of Judea and the Pharisees came to be baptized John stopped them it's a strange thing to do Don was a Baptist he'd take about anybody he was known as John the Baptist's not because he stopped people from being baptized but because he wanted to baptize people the people come here come some Pharisees for what would be part of the revival will come be baptized said wait a minute Matthew 3 and 1 in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand this is he that was spoken about the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight the same John had his raiment of camels hair a leathern girdle about his loins his meat was locusts and wild honey doesn't doesn't sound very secret sensitive does it he was Elijah and he come out of the wilderness and they when they went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea in the region around about Jordan were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins and when many when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come will you talk about the word coming on strong wait a minute generation of vipers coming to be baptized you're coming to be baptized but do you really want to be well because if you really want to be well there'll be certain things that will take place in your life listen he said bring bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and he didn't require that necessarily of everyone but he did of the Pharisees because they already had an idea that they were saved they thought they were ready to meet the Messiah they thought that their legalistic idea gave them the ability well I believe message Moses brought I can quote it word for word I I dressed right I'd do right and John said don't come be baptized don't come to a place of repentance until you bring forth fruit fruits meet for repentance he says a thing not to say within yourselves were predestinated we have Abraham to our Father for I say to you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham now also the axis later to the root of the trees earth therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance me he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire he says you think my message is strong wait till he comes you see they had to come the way of repentance and I've read this recently and better it fit here but the random and the efficient church age sees just what is the way back the way is the way of repentance you don't come to God telling God how you're going to come to him the blind men didn't have any options but to go to the pool the sick men didn't have any options but to pick up his bed on the Sabbath day and take the criticism you'll come to God and tell him this is what I'll do well pastors it's all over it's you know we I don't have to it's just you know something that I've dealt with and and I don't have to know you have to repent well it's just it's all over it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you got to come to God and be willing to open up and bare yourself before him and say Lord I'm done I'm tired of leaving myself I'm tired of laying at this pool you have to want to be well I'm tired of being in this situation everybody says around the message we need revival but are we gonna get to the point where we can say Lord we know we'll be a worldwide check you if I have a let it be in me I'm tired of just going to church at Sunday after Sunday and coming out the same person I was I want to be different I want to be changed if I want to do that how am I gonna do it I've got to come according to God's Word brother Brown says what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more he said repent bring forth fruits meet for repentance prove it by your life you take a person that says they are he says I'm a believer I believe let the gospel light strike them brother they take it right now brother Browns preaching a sermon called he cares do you care do you want to be well you have to care and that's to be well he cares as we said the other day if it's if there if it's the blood of the Lamb in the word of your testimony the blood of the lamb is there blood of the Lambs doing what it's supposed to do but it's the word of our testimony if there's a problem that's where it is we're not overcoming that's what's wrong oh he said let the gospel light strike them brother they take it right now and those show results they say well I know this is the right thing to do but I'm not going to do that I'm just gonna go on you haven't repented I know it be right but I just for me it's not right the word doesn't fit you the word doesn't fit me Oh God listen I know it's a little bit hard you bear with me for a minute he said certainly you'll not see that man anymore pool rooms you'll not see him out here with a cigarette in his hand you won't see him drinking you won't see him flirting with other women said no okay how much they throw their female flesh before him he'll turn his head towards the skies and look towards Christ you do that every time you go in Walmart by the way or anywhere where there's people at what is it it shows that the remedy took effect and if it don't take effect you say well I know I took it well then where are you at today then I hope this is just going down and for you that are sitting here for those that would listen for me let it sink down in your heart this is the Word of God he said it'll turn its head til the skies look towards Christ he shows the remedy took effect if it don't take effect you say well I know I took it well then where are you at today then you're dying you show I'm looking at you as diagnosing your case by the Bible that you're still in sin and the wages of sin is death don't think it has to be made any plainer see your own actions prove that you didn't take it because if you took it you had me afraid of counsel you wouldn't be afraid of repentance you wouldn't be afraid of doing what you're required to do as a believer but you hang back and say while I'm waiting on God to do something do you want to be well he said yet you try to make yourself before your fellow man will go back he said see your own actions prove that you didn't take it you thought you did you might have been all sincere in doing it but she didn't do it for if you did God promised it would take effect on you you know what one of the things that a doctor has to do some of you that take medicine you know this sqr you taking your medicine my pastor but I have you had when I was there he had problems he had some real problems on time with his he had a heart surgery and then he started having real problems we thought well it's his heart is blocked again he can't breathe and all this stuff he'd been given medicine to keep his arteries open and he thought he didn't need it and he'll tell you thought he knew better than the doctor did so he didn't take the medicine so he goes to the doctor and they looking on they do all the tests and stuff and the doctors did you take your medicine no well shouldn't the doctor got rough with him he did he said he was rude he said if you don't take it I can't help you don't you see how that works with the gospel if you won't do yourself what you would require others to do in your situation how can you be helped you want you know the person who comes in church you look at them and say well they need to dress fried they need that trait but what about us you say you might have been all sincere and doing it but you didn't do it for if you did God promised it would take effect on you and the old sin is still there the old Adam nature still lingers there the old unbelief yet you try to make yourself before your fellow man to say well I'm a believer all glory to God yes I'm a believer but you see it didn't help you any maybe the patient itself he said wasn't even predestinated to the medicine that's a sobering thought if it did it'll never take effect you see but look at the little immoral woman God didn't care what you did or what you were just did you come to the door look at that little bit more a woman on the light struck her there was something laying there to take care of her condition see if we believe and sincerely confess this remedy of God's Way takes effect God hasn't provided way for these things now see men will go say well I joined the church that settles it with me that isn't God provided way God's provided ways repentance confessions and showing results bringing forth fruit meat for repentance showing sincerity if you people he said we'll just do that this morning this going to be prayed for you said you people to hear this tape all over the world after this tape was played and the minister the person is playing it in congregation groups out in the jungles or wherever you are this playing it will first make your confession clear and then come with nothing in your heart and all but faith and be prayed for there the medicine will take place he never said you had to play a tape in a congregation group but what he said if you do make sure you're applying it read it if you do make sure that you make your confession clear because it won't do you no good if you don't and then come with nothing your heart at all but faith and be prayed for there's the medicine will take place I'm closing with this it's a little bit of a long story but I read it and there's a parable delightful bit of country early one summer morning I walked out to be refreshed by the pure sweet air side of fields in the woods and grasses and flowers beasts and birds when presently I came upon an orchard into which I entered the trees were beautiful to behold the air was fragrant fruit was abundant I wandered on almost enchanted until to my great wonder I came upon a tree having neither bloom nor fruit so painfully impressed without any thought of hurting or giving offence and as to myself I said you poor lost tree what can you be doing here I'm Marvel you are not removed upon which to my astonishment the tree replied not without tartness Oh indeed sir indeed no doubt you think you're a wise wise above your father's you think you know about much about things I dare say but you're in a great mistake I am neither poor nor lost well I said you have neither leaves or fruit and probably no SAP and the tree says what does that have to do with it your ignorance is inexcusable he seemed not to know that a great Saviour of trees has been down here and I believed his gospel and it was saved by grace I've accepted salvation is a free gift and though I haven't either leaves no fruit I'm saved all the same I looked at it with pity and I said you're a poor deluded tree you're not saved at all you're only a dead tree despite all your talk about grace and redemption the only salvation you can ever know is to be made living and fruit-bearing listen life that is salvation you show signs of life you may be rough maybe an exterior that's hard to show signs of life oh so grateful I'm glad when the church shows signs of life I'm glad to see in your lives but you show signs of life you won't be just dead but there'd been something happened there's been something to take place you show signs of life it says life that is salvation when I come and see you Layton with fruit or even showing signs of leaves I'll say oh that poor tree that's safe that's the only way we know we don't know what's happening on the inside but if you see those signs of life and the tree says though you are not sound you don't understand the gospel and I thought so it is as with trees so with men they talked as if grace and salvation were something God keeps for them outside themselves will not understand or believe that he who has saved he who takes Christ fully and rest on his atoning work alone is made free from sin it has fruit to holiness musicians come do you want to be well Jesus found that man in the temple and said unto Him behold thou art made whole he didn't go through the process of picking up his bed walking in getting in an argument with his denomination said behold our made whole sin no more that's the worst thing coming to thee do you want to attain holiness it's the word we don't hear much anymore but it's still the truth we didn't throw that away you feel a real desire to be holy in your life would you be a partaker of the divine nature what holiness means it's not long sleeves and long dresses but it's a particular to be a partaker of the divine nature then go to Christ don't think about making yourself ready see because that's not it's not giving up all these things it's if you go through the door you show signs of life don't think about making yourself ready but say like this like to him says nothing in my hand I bring simply to thy cross I cling naked flee to thee for dress helpless look to thee for grace you see he said as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name could we sing amazed that he loved me loves me I'm amazed that he cares did you bow your heads together and the presence of God [Music] Moses took Aaron's stick just an old dead dry stick that had been cut up and hadn't been attached to the life in a long time but there's something about the presence of this kind of God that when you take that stick and he put it down inside of the Holy of Holies down inside inside of the Ark of the Covenant under the influence of that Shekinah presence of God so the word never works just as a letter alone letter alone kills but the Spirit brings life in that life and in that light that dry stick it hadn't been attached to the vine for years so dusty and dead it began to bring forth fruit almonds begin to come out of it the life that was in it began to be produced overnight and I'm not saying that you become a full tree overnight but there's life where there was once only death where there was once only heartache where it was what you just couldn't overcome but all the sudden there's grace to overcome all of a sudden there's something in your life that makes you different I'm not preaching legalism this morning I want to see life I want to see life you don't set conditions for that life you don't get to come and say now come if I can come this way I'll come I'll do it if I can if I if you let me come this way no it's not me to let you come you've got to come God's provided way there's guards at the door the mercy you've got to come according to God's provided way which is his word his word speaks to you this morning it says I want you to do this so would you go wash in the pool just go let's go wash dodo back if you hold back you'll never be healed if you hold back you'll never be held we want to behold this morning you're listening this morning if you're watching would you just make your heart make the place where you're seated an altar so lord I want to be whole I'm so amazed that you

of years for the bed but remember you can be tried and brother Brad resentful if a sinner needs to repent then a Christian needs to repent that much more oh how we need God to move in our lives you say oh wait I see circumstances ahead I see problems we can't overcome we can overcome them through the power of the blood we can overcome them nothing is too hard for God he won't God to move then
