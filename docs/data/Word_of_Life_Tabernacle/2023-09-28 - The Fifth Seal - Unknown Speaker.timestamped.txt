[41:50] each thing that's done we ask in Jesus
[41:53] name
[41:56] Hallelujah
[41:59] I want to read from Revelation chapter 6
[42:02] verses 9 through 11 tonight as we are
[42:05] entering into the fifth seal
[42:08] and it's been just an overview of the
[42:10] seals refreshing our memory so we can
[42:13] deal uh with some other things in
[42:15] Greater detail I really have enjoyed
[42:19] this myself though and getting back into
[42:21] these things and being reminded of some
[42:24] of the things that that we were taught I
[42:26] believe it's important and it helps us
[42:28] in every area of our life we can apply
[42:30] it even the things that are to the the
[42:33] Jews and even during the tribulation
[42:35] period And yet there's parts of this we
[42:37] can apply to our own lives and we can
[42:40] take from it and so we just love the
[42:43] Lord for the word tonight amen good to
[42:46] see each and every one of you remember
[42:47] communion Sunday evening just always a
[42:50] blessed time that we have here at the
[42:52] church
[42:54] Revelation chapter 6 and verse 9 we need
[42:56] to open the fifth seal I saw under the
[42:59] altar The Souls of them that were slain
[43:01] for the word of God
[43:03] and for the testimony which they held
[43:06] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[43:09] how long O Lord holy and true thus thou
[43:13] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[43:15] that dwell on the Earth
[43:17] and white robes were given unto every
[43:19] one of them and it was said unto them
[43:21] that they should rest yet for a little
[43:23] season
[43:25] until until their fellow servants also
[43:27] and their Brethren that should be killed
[43:30] as they were should be fulfilled pray
[43:33] the Lord would add His blessings of the
[43:34] word you may be seated
[43:37] I want you to notice first of all
[43:39] tonight is we're going to try to move
[43:41] quickly through this and and get you out
[43:43] of here on a school night
[43:46] but there's no mention of a beast or a
[43:48] living creature
[43:50] or a horse or a rider so there's a
[43:53] change from the fourth seal the first
[43:56] four seals and the fifth seal there's no
[44:01] mention of of the living creatures in
[44:03] the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal or the
[44:05] seventh seal and brother Brandon said
[44:07] the reason for that he said according to
[44:10] the Revelation the Lord Jesus gave me
[44:12] today this morning early he said that
[44:14] the mystery of the church ages are
[44:16] already finished at this time so we've
[44:18] been looking on Earth and now we begin
[44:20] to look it into Heavenly things
[44:22] and he said the mystery of the
[44:24] Antichrist is revealed at this time I
[44:27] believe that's the case today the
[44:29] mystery of the Antichrist is revealed
[44:31] the Antichrist took his last tribe we
[44:34] found him on this pale horse mixed with
[44:36] many colors and he rides all the way
[44:38] into Perdition remember it was this
[44:41] message it was under the message of
[44:43] Elijah that he was given a name he was
[44:46] called Death he was exposed as death so
[44:49] we find him identified he identified
[44:52] death as spiritual death in a
[44:55] denominational Antichrist system so we
[44:58] as to go back just for a moment and then
[45:00] we'll move forward those four beasts
[45:02] were to Combat Four Horses so you have
[45:05] four powers combating four powers
[45:07] everybody understand that tonight a
[45:10] beast is a power and a power is an
[45:13] anointing right when someone talks about
[45:15] the anointing what they mean is an
[45:17] empowerment
[45:18] an anointing David was anointed to be
[45:20] king he was empowered to be king when
[45:23] we're anointed by the Holy Ghost we are
[45:25] empowered to do something anointing is
[45:28] not just being loud or or shouting or
[45:31] something like that although that may
[45:33] come with it but it's actually being
[45:35] empowered to do what God called us to do
[45:39] and to live the word of our hours so we
[45:42] find that that white horse came out that
[45:45] white that power uh came out and uh it
[45:49] was it was false teaching it was an
[45:51] antichrist spirit that was supposed by
[45:53] what it was opposed by The Lion The
[45:57] Spirit of the lion or or like a lion a
[46:00] pure word brother Brown said manifested
[46:01] by the Holy Ghost
[46:04] so he he was a false teaching and it
[46:08] come in and I just want to take this as
[46:10] an aside because it meant a lot to me
[46:13] what I've been studying about this
[46:14] Antichrist system
[46:16] and they actually thought they were
[46:18] doing God a service
[46:20] by pulling off into their own clique
[46:23] and I want us to be careful as a word of
[46:26] warning tonight as a pastor we need to
[46:28] be careful that we don't pull off into
[46:30] clicks but we're a body we're a body of
[46:34] Believers we we don't need to uh so uh
[46:38] socialize only among those with in our
[46:40] same socio-economic status or or
[46:43] something like that we don't put one
[46:45] down here and one up here preachers up
[46:47] here and people down here or something
[46:49] like that but we're all one we We Belong
[46:52] Together
[46:54] because in that Antichrist move he said
[46:56] well you know little he said like little
[46:58] clicks will arise up in the church he
[47:00] said you know what you pastors he said
[47:02] they like they say birds of a feather
[47:04] but if we're born again Brethren how
[47:06] many are born again tonight he said
[47:08] that's not the attitude to take
[47:11] see if we see something wrong in our
[47:13] Brethren he said let us just pray and
[47:17] keep it before God and love that man
[47:20] until we bring him right into the
[47:22] presence of God
[47:23] he said that's the way really to the way
[47:25] to do it so if we're born again we don't
[47:28] make our living we don't make our our
[47:30] lifestyle it's not attacking and
[47:32] attacking and coming at this one and
[47:35] coming at that one but it's actually
[47:37] trying to pray that person and love that
[47:40] person back into the kingdom of God we
[47:43] don't want to see one lost
[47:45] why because that's his desire he doesn't
[47:48] want to see one lost do you believe that
[47:50] tonight he doesn't want to see you lost
[47:52] he cares about every part of the church
[47:56] so
[47:58] and so he said you know Jesus said there
[48:00] will be weeds in there because Jesus
[48:03] said there would be but don't pull them
[48:05] up you'll take the wheat with it he said
[48:08] just let them alone he said he'll he'll
[48:11] do let him do the segregating when the
[48:14] time comes he let it all grow together
[48:16] so it was an effort to clean up the
[48:20] church an effort to make the church
[48:22] better an effort to do away with all the
[48:26] nonsense or so they thought and many
[48:28] times Satan will get into that and he'll
[48:31] make a cold dead powerless Church
[48:34] out of something that was intended to
[48:36] clean up the church
[48:38] and so I think as a pastor I I have to
[48:42] be careful to leave him alone let them
[48:44] grow up together
[48:46] and and so we don't start pulling up the
[48:48] uh the wheat with the tears right and as
[48:51] people we need to be careful with that
[48:53] let it grow together it's always going
[48:55] to be mixed till we leave here
[48:57] the truth is some of every church is
[49:00] going to go and some of every church is
[49:01] not going to go
[49:03] it's just the way it is but let us be
[49:05] that one let's be that one I'm going to
[49:08] be that one you you want to be that one
[49:11] so he'll do the segregating when the
[49:13] time comes so that was the White Horse
[49:15] move uh that that Antichrist Spirit Now
[49:18] red horse was physical persecution
[49:20] opposed by what the ox
[49:24] look what was opposed by not not a not
[49:27] some force of of man but it was uh it
[49:30] was sacrificial labor
[49:33] sacrificial labor and Ox just gives
[49:36] himself to the work and brother random
[49:38] talks about polycarp and how that he
[49:40] gave himself to the stake to be burnt
[49:43] and and all the different ones from that
[49:45] age and what a glorious time it was he
[49:48] said but brother Ben how could they have
[49:49] done that and I love what brother Brown
[49:51] says here in the fifth seal about that
[49:53] he said don't forget this church he said
[49:55] you Brethren on tape I want you to
[49:57] examine this he said how could men do
[50:00] anything else besides the power of God
[50:03] that had been released to them
[50:06] so the reason they could do that is
[50:09] because the power of God had been
[50:10] released to do that it wasn't because
[50:12] they were superhuman it wasn't because
[50:14] they they'd been taught over and over
[50:17] again brainwashed into it it was because
[50:19] there had been a Power released to them
[50:21] and the reason why you'll escape
[50:23] laodicea the reason why you will
[50:25] overcome the reason why you're going to
[50:27] make it is because a power has been
[50:30] released to you you may not even realize
[50:32] it you may not always feel it you may
[50:34] not always think you're the one or
[50:36] you're going to be able to do it but you
[50:38] will overcome because an anointing has
[50:41] been released in this age to let you see
[50:43] what's wrong and what's right
[50:45] in the most deceptive ages there was how
[50:47] could men do anything else beside the
[50:49] power of God that's been released to
[50:51] them
[50:52] so then the Black Horse Road we found
[50:55] that spiritual control
[50:57] right remember all these horses they
[50:59] ride on to the end
[51:01] spiritual control control of purgatory
[51:04] and it was opposed by Godly wisdom the
[51:08] man
[51:09] the Branham called it Godly wisdom the
[51:11] face of a man
[51:12] so is Luther Wesley
[51:15] Etc they come those men smart men that
[51:18] could come with the cunningness of a man
[51:19] and oppose that and bring out from the
[51:22] scriptures that it was wrong
[51:24] and so then you come down to the Pale
[51:26] Horse the final one which we know is
[51:29] spiritual death
[51:30] opposed by what by an eagle
[51:34] Yeah by an eagle
[51:35] it was prophetic revelation
[51:38] listen to me you will not overcome
[51:40] spiritual death in this age outside the
[51:42] message of the hour
[51:44] you may come up with all kinds of other
[51:46] influences you might say well I'll just
[51:49] kind of hide the fact that I'm a message
[51:50] believer you might as well embrace it
[51:52] because you will not overcome this end
[51:55] time power of a Pale Horse you will not
[51:58] overcome spiritual death without the
[52:00] message of the hour because only
[52:02] prophetic revelation will cause you to
[52:05] oppose the Pale Horse move
[52:08] so so here this Prophet would come but
[52:11] the man would talk about how he had no
[52:12] certain mystery but it would come and
[52:15] and there's criticism of this fifth seal
[52:17] because brother Branham says it's the
[52:20] Jews and many said that these were
[52:23] Christian martyrs
[52:25] and and that's what most commentaries
[52:27] say but there there were people who said
[52:29] that it was the Jews Larkin was one who
[52:32] said it was the Jews there were others
[52:33] who taught that but nobody had a voice
[52:35] of authority nobody can say in fact when
[52:38] Larkin wrote it was before World War II
[52:41] and you'll see why that's important in a
[52:43] moment brother Brown said these things
[52:44] could not be revealed until they had
[52:46] happened
[52:47] right it said in motion that's what the
[52:49] opening of the seals is all these things
[52:52] there's no more delay all these things
[52:54] are open before us
[52:56] in motion the tribulation periods in
[52:59] motion the pale horse riders in motion
[53:01] they haven't maybe come to their
[53:03] fruition yet but everything's moving you
[53:05] understand that tonight
[53:08] so it's open
[53:10] so now let's look at this fifth seal
[53:13] it says when he had opened the fifth
[53:14] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[53:17] them that were slain for the word of God
[53:19] and for the testimony which they held
[53:22] now these souls are not the bride
[53:25] so if you're keeping notes or middle
[53:26] notes if you keep mental notes I I'll be
[53:29] honest with you I like to keep mental
[53:31] notes but then they're a little bit hard
[53:33] to get get back at sometimes my problem
[53:36] is not my memory it's my recall
[53:39] so you just can't find it in that index
[53:41] system
[53:43] so their souls are are not the bride
[53:46] they are they are the uh they're Israel
[53:49] and brother random teaches us from the
[53:51] word why they're not the bride most
[53:53] teachers saw these as Christian Martyrs
[53:55] now he said brother Brandon said these
[53:57] cannot be them Souls because the souls
[54:00] of the righteous martyred and the
[54:02] righteous people the church the bride
[54:03] has done been took up that's pretty
[54:05] simple isn't it he said so they wouldn't
[54:07] be under the altar he said who are they
[54:09] then if they're not the early church he
[54:11] said this is Israel that's to be saved
[54:13] as a nation he said all them that are
[54:16] predestinated and that's important
[54:19] because not all Israel is Israel
[54:23] they're predestined just like we are
[54:25] yeah right there's a predestined group
[54:27] of Israel and there's a predestined
[54:29] group of the church the Gentiles but
[54:32] there's a predestined group of Israel
[54:33] the difference is that predestined group
[54:36] has saved as a nation saved as a group
[54:38] we are not saved as a group we're saved
[54:40] as individuals
[54:42] but that but there is a predestined
[54:43] group there's some who hold to the law
[54:45] there were some who won't there are some
[54:47] who live it there's some who don't just
[54:49] like Among Us
[54:51] right so now
[54:52] uh he said who are they then if they're
[54:55] not the early church this Israel is to
[54:56] be saved as a nation all them that are
[54:58] predestinated Romans 11 25 let's let's
[55:01] look at it from the scripture for a
[55:02] moment
[55:04] what the promise is for Israel he said
[55:06] he said I would not Brethren that you
[55:08] should be ignorant of this mystery
[55:10] lest you should be wise in your own
[55:12] conceits
[55:14] I like that he said I want you to be
[55:16] wise in your own conceit and just do
[55:19] away with something that God has a plan
[55:21] for
[55:22] come on right and we need to be careful
[55:24] with each other
[55:26] that we don't become conceited
[55:28] and do away with something that God has
[55:30] a plan for
[55:31] God can do anything he can bring anybody
[55:35] back
[55:36] to him he can save anybody oh yeah
[55:39] there'll be scars but he can save
[55:41] anybody he's got his own he keeps his
[55:43] own counsel he doesn't tell us all the
[55:46] time what he's going to do either
[55:48] so he said don't be conceited he said
[55:50] that blindness in part is happened to
[55:54] Israel until the fullness of the
[55:56] Gentiles become in it's blindness in
[55:59] part because there were Jews there were
[56:01] Jews who could see
[56:02] but there was a group of Jews who could
[56:04] not see
[56:05] they couldn't they they couldn't see him
[56:08] at all
[56:09] and they couldn't see the gospel at all
[56:11] and they've been that way for for uh 2
[56:14] 000 years now
[56:16] Romans 11 26 and so all Israel shall be
[56:21] saved someone say all Israel
[56:23] as it is written there shall come out of
[56:25] Zion to deliver and shall turn away
[56:28] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[56:31] Covenant unto them when I shall take
[56:33] away their sins
[56:34] oh I love that this is my Covenant so
[56:37] he's saying they're going to be saved
[56:38] all Israel all those remember the
[56:40] predestinated group are truly Israel
[56:43] will be saved now brother Brandon says
[56:45] this he said now there Israel that's
[56:47] under this altar he said watch Israel
[56:49] was blinded for the very purpose
[56:51] of us being saved
[56:54] this is a great truth Church
[56:56] it's a great truth it'll humble you if
[56:58] you recognize it
[57:00] he said you believe that now Who blinded
[57:02] them God
[57:05] blinded his own children
[57:09] see we didn't have a place
[57:11] we weren't a nation that was chosen by
[57:14] God
[57:15] we were not we were not chosen to be as
[57:18] a nation to be he didn't choose America
[57:21] as his nation is his people he didn't
[57:24] choose the English or he didn't choose
[57:25] the Anglo-Saxons he chose the Jews
[57:29] and they were his people they were his
[57:32] children
[57:33] God blinded his own children to come get
[57:36] a renegade like me
[57:41] or just makes me want to weep when I
[57:43] think about it
[57:44] [Music]
[57:46] he said no wonder Jesus standing there
[57:47] at the cross and them Jews howling for
[57:50] his blood
[57:52] kids
[57:53] and he was the scripture he was himself
[57:57] the word
[58:00] and here he said he knowing that those
[58:03] people would have gladly received him
[58:05] think about it if he'd come any other
[58:08] way they would have gladly received it
[58:11] he said and that's the reason he blinded
[58:13] them so they wouldn't recognize him he'd
[58:17] come in such a humble way and blinded
[58:20] them to it that they wouldn't receive it
[58:23] the scripture said they would do it and
[58:25] he blinded was blinded he said Jesus
[58:28] pitied them even so much as he said
[58:30] father forgive them they don't know what
[58:33] they're doing they literally did not
[58:35] know what they were doing
[58:37] they were blind Paul said they were
[58:40] blinded for a cause for us
[58:44] and brother round uses the example of
[58:47] Joseph and Joseph is a is a fascinating
[58:49] example because it's so true and so real
[58:53] to what happened with the Jews remember
[58:55] Joseph was sold down into slavery and
[59:00] and they threw him they threw him in a
[59:01] pit he was sold for 30 pieces of silver
[59:03] thrown into a pit and and they thought
[59:06] to do away with him they didn't value
[59:09] him
[59:10] they were jealous of him
[59:13] and so they sent him and they don't
[59:16] realize he's going up to Egypt and then
[59:18] you know the story how he goes to
[59:19] Potiphar's house and and you know
[59:21] sometimes many times the Way Up Is Down
[59:24] so instead of get getting promoted
[59:26] Joseph gets demoted
[59:28] right and he does the right thing and
[59:31] loses his job and ends up in prison over
[59:33] it
[59:35] but he still could have satisfaction he
[59:37] did the right thing
[59:39] so he ends up in prison and and then you
[59:41] know the story of the Baker and and the
[59:43] different ones over there and how he
[59:44] told their uh their future and and
[59:47] Pharaoh heard about it and he ends up at
[59:49] the right hand of pharaoh
[59:51] just in time for a famine to come
[59:54] you talk about a God who knows
[59:56] everything every little detail and
[59:58] orchestrates world events oh we we
[1:00:01] shouldn't worry we shouldn't fear we
[1:00:03] shouldn't pray God knows what the
[1:00:04] economy is going to do he knows exactly
[1:00:07] what's going to happen
[1:00:09] so here they come into a famine and when
[1:00:12] they come into that famine time Joseph
[1:00:14] at the right hand at the right hand of
[1:00:16] pharaoh he he calls to his policies
[1:00:18] everything he worked with wisdom and and
[1:00:20] he knew the famine was coming because
[1:00:22] the pharaoh's dream that he had and so
[1:00:24] he stored up food
[1:00:26] and and he stored up food in here way
[1:00:28] down in Israel is Jacob and his son
[1:00:31] speaking that Joseph was dead
[1:00:34] and they get poor they get they get run
[1:00:36] out of their own country
[1:00:38] sounds familiar doesn't it they get
[1:00:40] driven out of their own country and they
[1:00:42] come up to find food and when they get
[1:00:45] there they go through the rigmarole that
[1:00:47] Joseph puts them through and sends them
[1:00:49] away and they don't recognize him and
[1:00:51] brings them back and finally in Genesis
[1:00:53] 45 1 it says then Joseph could not
[1:00:56] refrain himself
[1:00:58] uh brother Harold I can't even imagine
[1:01:01] how he must have felt
[1:01:03] his own brothers and here he is with his
[1:01:05] kingly robes on and they didn't
[1:01:07] recognize him in that condition yeah
[1:01:10] the last time they saw him he was a
[1:01:12] little muddy slave thrown into a pit
[1:01:16] but now he's grown up and he said he was
[1:01:20] sitting at the right hand of pharaoh and
[1:01:22] it says he could not refrain himself
[1:01:23] before all them that stood by him and he
[1:01:26] cried caused every man to go out from me
[1:01:28] and there stood no man with him while
[1:01:31] Joseph made himself known unto his
[1:01:33] Brethren but the bread and put it this
[1:01:34] way his sin is Gentile wife back into
[1:01:36] the palace
[1:01:38] to reveal himself to his brethren
[1:01:41] and he wept aloud and the Egyptians in
[1:01:44] the house of pharaoh heard and Joseph
[1:01:46] said it to his Brethren I am Joseph
[1:01:49] now he didn't hide it no more
[1:01:51] he made it plain
[1:01:53] I am Joseph see if he'd come that way
[1:01:55] the first time they would have accepted
[1:01:57] it they would have received it but they
[1:01:59] couldn't come that way the first time
[1:02:01] because if he'd come that way the first
[1:02:02] time we wouldn't be saved
[1:02:06] so he says I am Joseph
[1:02:08] oh my God does my father yet live and
[1:02:11] his Brethren could not answer him they
[1:02:13] were troubled at his presence
[1:02:16] to this guy in a pit you can't keep a
[1:02:18] good man down can you through this guy
[1:02:20] in a pit years ago
[1:02:22] and here we'd come back and he's a king
[1:02:25] he's at the right hand yeah
[1:02:27] yeah
[1:02:29] they couldn't even talk
[1:02:31] and Joseph said unto his Brethren come
[1:02:33] near to me I pray you and they came near
[1:02:36] and he said I am Joseph your brother
[1:02:38] whom you sold into Egypt now therefore
[1:02:41] be not grieved
[1:02:45] oh you talk about the right attitude
[1:02:48] this is this is the man who understands
[1:02:50] that God's got everything in his control
[1:02:53] now see he held their lives in his hands
[1:02:56] all he had to do was refuse to give him
[1:02:58] food they would starve to death
[1:03:00] he could have done back to them what
[1:03:01] they did to him but he didn't do it
[1:03:04] he said don't be angry don't be grieved
[1:03:07] that you saw me hither for God did send
[1:03:09] me before you to preserve life
[1:03:13] yeah Hallelujah well the problem said
[1:03:15] see they had not a chance
[1:03:17] because they were blinded by God their
[1:03:19] own father so that the grace of God
[1:03:21] could be fulfilled so the bride could be
[1:03:24] took from the Gentiles he talked about
[1:03:26] how God crossed Jacob's hands remember
[1:03:29] when he's blessing the children and
[1:03:31] Joseph brings his sons up to be blessed
[1:03:33] they would be a part of that even though
[1:03:35] they were half Gentile but they would be
[1:03:37] a part of the tribes of Israel they
[1:03:39] would be grafted in
[1:03:40] and at that time there was an older son
[1:03:42] and a younger son and he would usually
[1:03:45] would lay by tradition his right hand on
[1:03:46] the elders his left hand on the youngest
[1:03:48] but God crossed his hands and Joseph was
[1:03:51] upset and went to move it and he said no
[1:03:53] he said God crossed my hands
[1:03:56] crossed over from the Jews to the
[1:03:58] Gentiles
[1:04:00] people that were not a people
[1:04:02] James in Acts 15 13 said it this way
[1:04:04] after they'd held their peace James
[1:04:06] answers said men and Brethren hearken to
[1:04:08] me Simeon that Simon Peter had declared
[1:04:10] how God is the first to visit the
[1:04:12] Gentiles to take out of them a people
[1:04:14] for his name a people for his name
[1:04:16] brother said that means he's given them
[1:04:18] his name he would have a bride
[1:04:21] and to disagree the words of the
[1:04:22] prophets as it is written after this I
[1:04:25] will return and will build again the
[1:04:26] Tabernacle of David which has fallen
[1:04:28] down I will build again the ruins
[1:04:30] thereof and I will set it up that's the
[1:04:32] residue of men that's us
[1:04:33] my seek after the Lord and all the
[1:04:36] Gentiles upon whom my name is called
[1:04:38] Faith the Lord who doeth all these
[1:04:40] things and listen what James said he
[1:04:42] said known unto God or all his works
[1:04:45] from the beginning of the world God
[1:04:47] knows what he's doing you believe that
[1:04:49] church
[1:04:50] God knows what he's doing
[1:04:53] blinded his own children for me
[1:05:01] but he has not forgotten them
[1:05:05] there's many examples in scripture but
[1:05:07] look at Jeremiah 31 because one brother
[1:05:09] Brandon refers to in the fifth seal
[1:05:12] to behold the days come saith the Lord
[1:05:14] I'll make a New Covenant with the house
[1:05:15] of Israel with the house of Judah not
[1:05:18] according to the Covenant that I made
[1:05:19] with their fathers in the day that I
[1:05:21] took them by the hand to bring them out
[1:05:22] of the land of Egypt which my my
[1:05:25] Covenant they break he said although I
[1:05:27] was a husband unto them Faith the Lord
[1:05:31] but this shall be the Covenant that I
[1:05:33] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:05:35] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[1:05:38] law in their inward parts and write it
[1:05:40] in their hearts and will be their God
[1:05:42] they shall be my people they shall teach
[1:05:45] no more every man in this neighbor and
[1:05:47] every man is brother saying know the
[1:05:48] Lord for they shall all know me he's
[1:05:50] going to reveal himself to him
[1:05:52] from the least of them even to the
[1:05:54] greatest of them saith the Lord I will
[1:05:56] forgive their iniquity I will remember
[1:05:58] their sin no more
[1:06:00] thus saith the Lord which giveth the son
[1:06:03] for a light by day and the ordinances of
[1:06:05] the moon the stars for a light by night
[1:06:07] which is divided to Sea when the waves
[1:06:09] are of Roar Lord of host is his name if
[1:06:12] those ordinances depart from before me
[1:06:14] saith the Lord then the seed of Israel
[1:06:16] also shall cease from being a nation
[1:06:18] from before me forever what's he saying
[1:06:20] if the sun quits shining if the moon
[1:06:23] quits shining if the laws of nature are
[1:06:25] suspended
[1:06:27] that's what it would take for me to
[1:06:30] forget my children that's what it would
[1:06:33] take for me to forget Israel in one
[1:06:34] place even said Can a mother forget her
[1:06:36] or sucking babe can a mother forget her
[1:06:39] own little baby he said yes she could he
[1:06:42] said but I will not forget you he said
[1:06:44] your names are engraved in the palms of
[1:06:46] my hands and I believe we can rightly
[1:06:48] look at that and say that we're as the
[1:06:50] elect that applies to us but it also
[1:06:52] applies to Israel
[1:06:55] Hallelujah the elected of God's people
[1:06:58] the seed of Israel also shall cease to
[1:07:01] be the nation before me forever thus
[1:07:03] saith the Lord If Heaven above can be
[1:07:06] measured
[1:07:07] the prayer puts it like this get a
[1:07:08] measuring stick and go measure heaven
[1:07:11] and the foundations of the earth
[1:07:13] searched out beneath I will also cast
[1:07:15] off all the seed of Israel for all that
[1:07:18] they have done
[1:07:19] saith the Lord as long as there's a
[1:07:22] universe that they don't know much about
[1:07:23] as long as they've never been to the
[1:07:25] core of the earth there is still a
[1:07:27] nation Israel that God loves and he will
[1:07:31] not forget them
[1:07:33] oh what that ought to do for us tonight
[1:07:35] knowing that we have that same God he
[1:07:38] didn't just choose Israel he also chose
[1:07:39] us
[1:07:41] right I'll say this brother Branham
[1:07:43] tells us that he said this nation the
[1:07:45] only thing that kept him afloat was the
[1:07:46] way they treated Israel
[1:07:48] right and when the station is good to
[1:07:50] Israel good things happen
[1:07:53] you don't we underestimate that when
[1:07:55] Donald Trump I'm not a big trunk fan
[1:07:58] just get that out of the way but when he
[1:08:00] put the embassy back to Jerusalem this
[1:08:03] country was being blessed
[1:08:05] anytime we have a something against an
[1:08:07] Administration against Israel I don't
[1:08:09] care what else they do
[1:08:11] if there's an Administration against
[1:08:12] Israel the blessing begins to go away
[1:08:15] because brother Brown said that's the
[1:08:17] only thing even keeping this nation
[1:08:18] afloat you say well some of those are
[1:08:21] not elected and that's true many of the
[1:08:23] Jews that are there won't be a part of
[1:08:25] the 144 000. there's many more than that
[1:08:28] many of them will will not be a part of
[1:08:30] that but let's look at it this way we
[1:08:33] don't know who's who
[1:08:34] so you better be good to all of them
[1:08:36] let me go a little bit deeper the same
[1:08:38] thing applies to the bride
[1:08:40] you don't know who's who you said well
[1:08:42] they message people them and people at
[1:08:44] the church man they're just a bunch of
[1:08:45] Scallywags you don't know who's who you
[1:08:47] better be nice to all of them all we
[1:08:49] know is the bride comes from the message
[1:08:51] group
[1:08:53] Hallelujah and there's a there's a
[1:08:55] there's 144 000 coming from that Jewish
[1:08:58] group
[1:09:01] we better be good to all of them right
[1:09:05] said he had to Blind his own child
[1:09:08] think of that blind his own child to
[1:09:10] give us a chance and we turn it down
[1:09:15] they don't turn him down
[1:09:18] if you have conviction in your heart
[1:09:20] that's a precious thing
[1:09:22] don't turn him down I'll say you young
[1:09:24] people that are here you you children
[1:09:26] that are here don't turn him down
[1:09:28] he may not he will not strive forever
[1:09:32] don't turn him down see he he blinded
[1:09:35] his own child
[1:09:36] so we could accept him
[1:09:39] he said now don't that make you feel
[1:09:40] about so little you could crawl under a
[1:09:42] concrete block with a 10 gallon hat on
[1:09:44] and never touch it
[1:09:46] so that's pretty small you know
[1:09:50] we cannot cast off his elect
[1:09:54] amen look at Zechariah 12 9. brother
[1:09:57] Branham references these scriptures and
[1:09:59] quotes these scriptures in the seal but
[1:10:01] I just took it from the scripture so you
[1:10:03] can see it he said it shall come to pass
[1:10:05] in that day I will seek to destroy all
[1:10:07] the nations that come against Jerusalem
[1:10:09] and I will pour upon the House of David
[1:10:11] and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:10:13] the spirit of Grace and of supplications
[1:10:15] listen if you can be sorry for your sin
[1:10:18] you did not do that on your own that
[1:10:21] come from God
[1:10:22] if you can if you can cry out to God for
[1:10:26] forgiveness you did not do that you did
[1:10:28] not produce that that come from God
[1:10:31] they will cry out because they will have
[1:10:33] a spirit of Grace and supplications
[1:10:35] poured out on them look at the grace of
[1:10:38] God they shall look upon me whom they
[1:10:40] have pierced they shall mourn for him as
[1:10:42] one mourneth for his only son and shall
[1:10:45] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[1:10:47] in bitterness for his firstborn they'll
[1:10:49] finally see it
[1:10:51] oh my when the Gentile age is over for
[1:10:53] the bill they'll finally see it there'll
[1:10:55] be an elected group 144 000 that'll
[1:10:58] finally see it
[1:11:01] amen
[1:11:03] and once you're saying to him what are
[1:11:05] these wounds in thine hands
[1:11:09] by the way
[1:11:11] where'd you get those scars
[1:11:14] he says oh
[1:11:15] I got those in the house my friends
[1:11:20] talk about Divine love
[1:11:23] we don't even understand Church
[1:11:25] we're doing people can be cold and hard
[1:11:28] never never feel never never had feel
[1:11:32] anything never how can you do that how
[1:11:33] can you remain cold how can you remain
[1:11:36] dead in the presence of that kind of
[1:11:38] love
[1:11:44] said I got them in the house with my
[1:11:45] friends
[1:11:46] oh he said then they'll realize they've
[1:11:48] killed the Messiah what will he say the
[1:11:50] same as Joseph did you did it to serve
[1:11:52] life
[1:11:53] don't be angry with yourself because the
[1:11:55] Gentiles would not have been brought in
[1:11:57] if the Jews hadn't been done that
[1:11:58] blindfolded trick so he saved the life
[1:12:01] of the church by the things that they
[1:12:03] done
[1:12:04] don't get too angry at anything that
[1:12:06] happens
[1:12:08] might be the gentle tender hand of
[1:12:10] Jehovah
[1:12:12] he said so there you are that's the
[1:12:14] reason today they can't understand this
[1:12:16] it isn't the hour
[1:12:18] now look
[1:12:20] now brother Brown gets several
[1:12:21] scriptural examples why these are not
[1:12:23] the bride now I'm going through this
[1:12:26] slower than I intended to but you all
[1:12:27] just just bear with me for a few minutes
[1:12:30] why are these not the right number one
[1:12:32] because they were killed for the
[1:12:34] testimony they held
[1:12:36] not the testimony of Christ
[1:12:39] I just wrote These down to be clear they
[1:12:42] were killed for the testimony of the
[1:12:43] Hill not the testimony of Christ was
[1:12:44] Revelation 6 9 says it says they were
[1:12:46] slain for the word of God but the
[1:12:48] problem said that was the law and for
[1:12:50] the testimony which they held they held
[1:12:52] true to that law
[1:12:55] those Souls have been martyred now he
[1:12:57] said down through here real true Jews
[1:12:58] down through there that had their name
[1:13:00] on the book remember not all Israel is
[1:13:02] Israel
[1:13:03] had their name on the book live the
[1:13:05] right life done the right thing live
[1:13:07] Judaism to the dot as far as they knew
[1:13:09] they were living it
[1:13:10] they were they were doing what's right
[1:13:12] and all they got for it was to be killed
[1:13:16] and we know they were not the bride now
[1:13:18] this is this is fascinating to me it's
[1:13:20] always meant a lot to me even since I
[1:13:22] was a kid
[1:13:24] because
[1:13:26] they ask for Revenge
[1:13:31] remember the crowd was a loud voice oh
[1:13:34] God
[1:13:36] how long O Lord holy and true
[1:13:39] just thou not judge and offend our
[1:13:41] avenge our blood
[1:13:43] on them that dwell on the Earth
[1:13:45] this is important
[1:13:48] how long you
[1:13:49] you say well
[1:13:51] brother Ben you don't understand what
[1:13:53] I've been through
[1:13:55] uh you know I have a right to seek
[1:13:57] revenge
[1:13:59] well so did they
[1:14:01] they were martyred by Eichmann and many
[1:14:03] others you ever studied Eichmann that's
[1:14:05] a fascinating case Eichmann wasn't a bad
[1:14:08] man he was raised in an Evangelical
[1:14:10] Christian family strict Lutheran
[1:14:13] calvinist Christians
[1:14:15] he wasn't a bad man he was just caught
[1:14:18] up in the order of that day the spirit
[1:14:20] of that day and signed orders and
[1:14:23] personally supervised loading them onto
[1:14:25] onto trains
[1:14:27] and brother Bynum when he preaches the
[1:14:29] seals he just a couple years before that
[1:14:31] watched eichmann's testimony and he
[1:14:33] tells about it it was I believe 1960s
[1:14:36] when they caught him in Argentina and
[1:14:38] they pulled him up in front of the world
[1:14:39] some of you are old enough maybe you
[1:14:41] remember that don't you don't have to
[1:14:42] raise your hand but
[1:14:43] some of you may remember eichmann's
[1:14:45] testimony but but it was uh it was a
[1:14:48] striking thing to brother Branham and so
[1:14:50] he he references Eichmann a lot and not
[1:14:52] just Hitler but Eichmann because he was
[1:14:54] the one directly responsible he wasn't
[1:14:57] even a general or anything like that he
[1:14:59] was just responsible he was an expert on
[1:15:01] the Jews even traveled to Israel and
[1:15:03] things but but what was he got caught up
[1:15:05] in the spirit right oh don't get caught
[1:15:07] up in the politics of the day there's no
[1:15:10] telling what you might do
[1:15:12] no he said they were martyred by
[1:15:13] Eichmann and many others honest people
[1:15:15] millions of them down there them Germans
[1:15:17] shot them to death and murdered them and
[1:15:19] killed him hung him on fences and burned
[1:15:21] them and cremated them and everything
[1:15:22] else
[1:15:24] they had a right to ask for Revenge
[1:15:28] they were hated without a cause and they
[1:15:31] wanted vengeance
[1:15:33] listen what brother Brandon tells us he
[1:15:35] said now if that had been the bride
[1:15:38] it had been like Stephen
[1:15:40] father forgive them
[1:15:44] for hanging them on fences
[1:15:47] now how do you know that because that's
[1:15:49] what they did that's what Stephen did
[1:15:50] that's what men Anointed with that Ox
[1:15:52] Spirit down to the age they didn't ask
[1:15:54] for vengeance
[1:15:56] they were killed they were done the same
[1:15:58] way but they didn't ask for vengeance
[1:16:01] why they were oh my these Jews didn't
[1:16:04] have the spirit of Christ they don't
[1:16:05] have the Holy Ghost you do
[1:16:08] yeah then what should we do I don't care
[1:16:10] what he said but you don't understand
[1:16:12] the hurt that I have forgive them
[1:16:16] to be bride material you've got to
[1:16:19] forgive them
[1:16:20] he said if had been the bride it'd been
[1:16:22] like Stephen father forgive him and
[1:16:24] notice again he says this in the church
[1:16:26] age book how these are crying out for
[1:16:28] vengeance they cannot be bride material
[1:16:32] think about that for a minute listen
[1:16:33] what Jesus says he said if you from your
[1:16:36] heart
[1:16:37] don't forgive
[1:16:39] from your heart
[1:16:41] right he said neither will your heavenly
[1:16:44] father forgive you
[1:16:47] it don't matter what they did lots of
[1:16:50] bad things happen I'm not trying to
[1:16:51] diminish what happened these people were
[1:16:53] the Holy Ghost is the most maybe the
[1:16:55] most horrific singular or most horrific
[1:16:58] event that ever happened on the face of
[1:17:00] the Earth
[1:17:01] and yet they yeah if they had been the
[1:17:04] bride they would have said father
[1:17:06] forgive them sir
[1:17:08] all right forgive them Father they know
[1:17:11] not what they do yet I know churches
[1:17:14] being destroyed by bitterness people
[1:17:16] preachers to being destroyed by
[1:17:18] bitterness sometimes we we in our own
[1:17:20] lives we let that root of bitterness
[1:17:22] keep going you better get it out of
[1:17:24] there
[1:17:25] because to go in a Rapture to go home
[1:17:28] and live with the Lord you're going to
[1:17:29] have to root out every bit of that
[1:17:31] because the Bible says that there will
[1:17:34] not be one bitter one Speck of
[1:17:35] bitterness there
[1:17:37] unforgiveness
[1:17:40] say God has to do that
[1:17:45] father
[1:17:46] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:17:48] do that's what makes us the brain
[1:17:51] one of the signs that we are the bride
[1:17:53] the sign that they were not the bride
[1:17:55] father
[1:17:57] forgive you talk to a Jew by the way I'm
[1:17:59] laboring on this for some reason I don't
[1:18:01] know why tonight but just bear with me
[1:18:03] I
[1:18:05] I listened to a a Jewish man on talk
[1:18:08] radio one time and he was saying he said
[1:18:10] you Christians don't understand he said
[1:18:11] there's no forgiveness
[1:18:13] you don't have to forgive somebody in
[1:18:15] the Jewish religion he says the biggest
[1:18:17] difference between the Christians and
[1:18:19] the Jews if somebody kills them they
[1:18:21] believe they have a right to kill them
[1:18:24] right you take you you come against my
[1:18:26] family I'll come against you twice as
[1:18:28] hard and I for an eye a tooth for tooth
[1:18:30] that's what they teach that's what the
[1:18:32] law taught but Jesus said father forgive
[1:18:35] them if they ask for your coat give them
[1:18:37] your cloak also if they ask you to walk
[1:18:39] a mile walk too yeah
[1:18:42] yeah right it's a completely different
[1:18:43] system what makes a difference you have
[1:18:45] the spirit of Christ
[1:18:48] now another reason why we know that they
[1:18:50] were not the bride they were given white
[1:18:53] robes I love this white robes were given
[1:18:56] unto every one of them
[1:18:58] but the parent said notice I want you to
[1:18:59] watch this real close they were given
[1:19:00] robes they didn't have them they were
[1:19:03] giving them are you still with me
[1:19:04] tonight
[1:19:05] they didn't have white ropes they were
[1:19:07] given what right robes each one of them
[1:19:09] he said now the Saints already have one
[1:19:13] glory to God so I I haven't seen mine
[1:19:17] yet what what's its fashion where it's
[1:19:20] righteousness
[1:19:21] not your righteousness but the
[1:19:23] righteousness of God
[1:19:25] they were given roads the Saints already
[1:19:29] had theirs and gone on right
[1:19:31] so that it's another indication that
[1:19:34] they were not the bride because the
[1:19:35] bride has already been made righteous by
[1:19:37] the blood of the Lamb
[1:19:40] so they were waiting he said on their
[1:19:42] Brethren to be killed like they were
[1:19:45] Revelation 6 11 it was said unto them
[1:19:46] they should rest yet for a little season
[1:19:48] until their fellow servants also in
[1:19:50] their Brethren should be killed as they
[1:19:52] were should be fulfilled fellow servants
[1:19:53] it's the two prophets of Revelation 11.
[1:19:56] Revelation 11 3 I'll give power unto my
[1:19:58] two witnesses it shall prophesy a
[1:20:00] thousand 203 score days three and a half
[1:20:02] years clothed in sackcloth that's Moses
[1:20:05] and Elijah how many understand that uh
[1:20:08] we know it's Moses Elijah because verse
[1:20:10] 6 says he's had power to shut Heaven
[1:20:12] that's Elijah right not in the days of
[1:20:14] their prophecy have powerful Waters to
[1:20:16] turn them to blood that's Moses the
[1:20:18] Smite the Earth with all plagues as
[1:20:19] often as they will
[1:20:21] in verse 7 when they shall finish their
[1:20:23] testimony the Beast to the sentence out
[1:20:24] of the bottomless pit to make war
[1:20:26] against them shall overcome them and
[1:20:28] kill them now that's their fellow
[1:20:30] servants that's going to die
[1:20:32] and brother Brown talked about the
[1:20:33] Pentecost was always looking for a great
[1:20:35] sign he said that's to the Jews
[1:20:37] we're just looking to go home in a
[1:20:38] Rapture right
[1:20:40] he said but now now the Brethren is 144
[1:20:43] thousand he said no notice thy Brethren
[1:20:45] my brethren had yet to be killed which
[1:20:47] means 144 000 yet to be called in the
[1:20:50] tribulation
[1:20:51] in Revelation 7 4 where you find that he
[1:20:54] said also now watch they have to be
[1:20:56] martyred by the Antichrist we just come
[1:20:58] through noticed in his last tribe where
[1:21:00] he breaks that Covenant with them Jews
[1:21:02] down there now watch brother Brown goes
[1:21:04] all the way through this and then he
[1:21:06] changes his Focus
[1:21:08] because he uses this because remember
[1:21:09] their souls under the altar
[1:21:11] well there's also Christians many of you
[1:21:14] have loved ones that have went on beyond
[1:21:16] the curtain of time
[1:21:18] right there's somewhere
[1:21:20] and some other random changes is focused
[1:21:22] from the Jewish Church to the bride
[1:21:25] and he says the bride is already waiting
[1:21:29] with white rose
[1:21:30] they got their white robes here
[1:21:33] but they wear them there
[1:21:35] yeah and now he said then that brother
[1:21:37] tells the story of going beyond the
[1:21:39] curtain of time and he actually goes
[1:21:41] there
[1:21:42] and he sees those people
[1:21:44] and then the voice spoke to him and said
[1:21:46] you've been gathered to your people like
[1:21:48] Jacob was gathered to his people
[1:21:50] right so there's a people under the
[1:21:52] altar crying for vengeance but these are
[1:21:54] not under the altar crying for vengeance
[1:21:56] these are waiting on us
[1:21:59] right so now he said all all these my
[1:22:02] people or all these branhams you know
[1:22:04] it's not a family affair he said no
[1:22:06] they're your converts to Christ
[1:22:09] now brother Branham looked at them and
[1:22:11] you remember the story he begins to he
[1:22:14] said well will I have to be judging he
[1:22:15] said they're waiting for the rewards to
[1:22:17] be given out he said well if I had if I
[1:22:19] have to be judged he said well Paul's
[1:22:21] people have to be judged with under his
[1:22:22] message he said yes he said well that'll
[1:22:25] be all right then he said because Paul I
[1:22:27] preached what Paul preached
[1:22:29] right I preached what Paul preached and
[1:22:32] he said millions cried out we're resting
[1:22:34] on that that's what I'm resting on today
[1:22:37] amen yes sir so now he said he called
[1:22:41] attention to these and he said they were
[1:22:43] the Saints he said if John looked over
[1:22:45] there and then was his Brethren his
[1:22:48] Brethren had to suffer a little I'm
[1:22:50] closing just in a minute just hang with
[1:22:52] me here he said then see the Lord God
[1:22:54] permitted me to see my brethren
[1:22:57] and the saints that were waiting for the
[1:22:59] coming of the Lord
[1:23:01] he said they were not under the altar of
[1:23:03] sacrifice mine wasn't he said but they
[1:23:05] were more see these were Martyrs see
[1:23:07] mine wasn't under the martyrs altar I
[1:23:09] should tell you right there we're not
[1:23:11] our destiny is not to be martyrs
[1:23:13] right we don't go in under the
[1:23:15] tribulation he said look they he said
[1:23:18] not the ones that the Lord showed me the
[1:23:19] bride she was not under the martyrs
[1:23:21] block no the sacrifice alter the martyrs
[1:23:24] but had received white robes how did she
[1:23:27] do it not for being martyred but by
[1:23:30] accepting the pardoning grace of the
[1:23:32] Living Word
[1:23:33] how many have accepted it tonight I've
[1:23:36] accepted the pardoning grace of the
[1:23:37] Living Word he said Christ would give
[1:23:39] them a white robe
[1:23:41] and he said talks about the doctrine of
[1:23:43] Soul sleeping I don't know if you've
[1:23:44] ever heard of that but Soul sleeping is
[1:23:46] the idea that when you die one day
[1:23:48] you'll just wake up and it'll be the
[1:23:50] Rapture in the resurrection you won't
[1:23:52] know anything in between it's called
[1:23:53] Soul sleeping your soul just like it's
[1:23:56] asleep brother Brown said that Doctrine
[1:23:58] was not correct your loved ones are
[1:24:00] somewhere
[1:24:01] right they're somewhere and they're
[1:24:03] awake
[1:24:05] right they're awake oh my
[1:24:08] God I love that I love that thought
[1:24:10] they're somewhere real
[1:24:13] in a better place than this
[1:24:15] he said I think this this proves that
[1:24:17] they're not sleeping they're alive
[1:24:20] their body's sleeping but the soul not
[1:24:23] in the grave they're in the presence of
[1:24:25] God
[1:24:26] under the altar not under the martyr's
[1:24:28] altar but under the altar look at Second
[1:24:30] Corinthians 5 1 for we know someone say
[1:24:33] we know
[1:24:34] we know that if our Earthly house that's
[1:24:37] this
[1:24:38] all of us live in a house of dust
[1:24:41] if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[1:24:44] were dissolved we have a building of God
[1:24:48] we have not we will have but we have a
[1:24:51] building of God a house not made with
[1:24:54] hands
[1:24:55] Eternal in the heavens
[1:24:57] oh my
[1:24:58] god brother Paul in one day you're just
[1:25:00] going to step out of this body and step
[1:25:02] into that one
[1:25:03] whether you go by way of the Grave or if
[1:25:05] it's time for the Rapture will you just
[1:25:07] step straight into your glorified body
[1:25:09] that's all you know oh my listen
[1:25:12] whichever way you go you're a winner
[1:25:14] right
[1:25:15] you're a winner because if you go by way
[1:25:17] of the Grave you come you come up first
[1:25:20] we could begin to see you and then we
[1:25:22] take a step
[1:25:23] right that's what he taught us now look
[1:25:25] we know this Earth if this Earthly house
[1:25:28] is resolved we have one not made with
[1:25:30] hands Eternal in the heavens we go
[1:25:31] somewhere when we die he said and I'm so
[1:25:34] grateful I'm so glad that God did this
[1:25:37] for us in our hour God did this for us
[1:25:39] so we wouldn't have to be like everybody
[1:25:42] who's wondering well is it going to be
[1:25:44] this way is it going to be that way this
[1:25:45] teacher taught it a certain way that
[1:25:47] teacher taught him a certain way but in
[1:25:49] this hour when the seals at the time of
[1:25:51] the opening of the seals here comes the
[1:25:53] prophet who said I've been there
[1:25:58] he said I'm so grateful to God that I
[1:26:00] can say is your pastor and brother I've
[1:26:02] seen those people
[1:26:04] so help me sit in that body and handle
[1:26:07] them with my hands
[1:26:10] ever wonder why they each one run up to
[1:26:11] him and hugged him
[1:26:13] said my precious brother he had to know
[1:26:15] they had real bodies
[1:26:17] oh my
[1:26:21] God he had to grab I grabbed a hold of
[1:26:22] them
[1:26:23] oh it makes me
[1:26:25] makes me want to overcome my tiredness
[1:26:27] and Shout tonight
[1:26:30] they had real bodies Brother David
[1:26:33] that real body he could handle them
[1:26:36] there wasn't some Spirit floating on a
[1:26:37] cloud he handled him with his hands
[1:26:40] they were real
[1:26:42] somewhere as I said your loved ones also
[1:26:44] went on that died in the Lord they they
[1:26:47] have real bodies
[1:26:49] oh my
[1:26:50] you said I truly believe with all my
[1:26:52] heart that the true Revelations of the
[1:26:55] revealings of the first second third
[1:26:57] fourth and fifth seal is now open to us
[1:27:01] there's more to it than just the Jews
[1:27:03] but although that's a great mystery it's
[1:27:05] a great it's a great thing to think that
[1:27:07] God would blind his own children to save
[1:27:10] me
[1:27:11] that's such a great thing but then to
[1:27:13] recognize that that the power of God
[1:27:15] would reach so far as to as to give me a
[1:27:19] light robe while I'm here on Earth even
[1:27:21] though I did nothing to deserve it
[1:27:23] and he gave me a lot rope and he's
[1:27:26] called me up in this hour come up higher
[1:27:28] and when I go up with him I'm going to
[1:27:31] meet my loved ones who are in a body
[1:27:33] it'll be just like mine aren't you glad
[1:27:35] for that today your body like his
[1:27:37] glorious body
[1:27:39] musicians go ahead and come
[1:27:43] brother Branham closes the fifth seal
[1:27:44] and I didn't put it on the board but
[1:27:46] just so you can ponder it and think
[1:27:48] about it
[1:27:49] he said if there is in this building
[1:27:51] tonight that person young or old
[1:27:53] that has to this time spurned that
[1:27:56] opportunity
[1:27:57] that cost God such a price
[1:27:59] and you would like to accept that offer
[1:28:01] to God tonight
[1:28:03] but you don't have to as far as we ever
[1:28:05] know to be a martyr though you may be
[1:28:07] but a white robe has been provided for
[1:28:10] you
[1:28:10] would you bow your heads with me
[1:28:12] and if God knocks at your heart now
[1:28:15] why not accept it
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:23] I don't know why you come to church
[1:28:25] maybe well it must have been I want to
[1:28:27] be a better person
[1:28:29] I really believe God sent a prophet
[1:28:35] you've been given a light robe
[1:28:37] you could just just accept it
[1:28:40] and it really is that simple
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:45] God is knocking at your heart he would
[1:28:47] he doesn't do that for everybody
[1:28:50] there's an elected group in this hour
[1:28:53] that he goes to he knocks at the door of
[1:28:56] laodicea but they won't let him in but
[1:28:58] he's knocking at your heart as an
[1:28:59] individual today because he knows you
[1:29:01] will let him in
[1:29:03] why don't you let him in let him have
[1:29:04] full control let him go through every
[1:29:06] room
[1:29:08] white robe has been provided for you
[1:29:11] God knocks at your heart why not accept
[1:29:13] it
[1:29:14] little horde he said my brother man I've
[1:29:16] already been saved I've been baptized
[1:29:18] just let him in
[1:29:20] let him have full control
[1:29:23] let him let him anoint you for the hour
[1:29:26] that you live in overcome every fiery
[1:29:29] Dart of the enemy
[1:29:32] we don't give our voices and our
[1:29:34] strength and our
[1:29:36] I hope you I hope you I hope I can show
[1:29:39] you that I want to give everything I
[1:29:40] have to the Lord I don't give that so
[1:29:42] you can be good people I want you to be
[1:29:45] good people I want you to be good
[1:29:46] citizens but I don't give my life I'm
[1:29:48] not giving my life to this church for
[1:29:51] good citizens
[1:29:52] so while we do it we want to see you in
[1:29:55] heaven
[1:29:56] we want you to see you born again by the
[1:29:59] blood of the Lamb you won't get there
[1:30:00] because you went to Word of Life

[1:30:03] you came on a Wednesday night even you
[1:30:06] only receive it you only you only go to
[1:30:09] that place because you've received that
[1:30:11] white robe
[1:30:13] from the hand of Christ himself and
[1:30:16] washed for the bleeding word would you
[1:30:18] just accept it tonight and believe he
[1:30:20] said is it that simple listen you you
[1:30:23] young people
[1:30:24] you kids
[1:30:26] if you're old enough to know that you're
[1:30:29] a sinner then you're old enough to
[1:30:31] accept the grace of God
[1:30:34] you're old enough to take him in
[1:30:37] you're old enough to be born again
[1:30:42] let's do that tonight maybe you're
[1:30:44] watching and
[1:30:45] or we'll watch this service God moves in
[1:30:48] mysterious ways I've always ever wanted
[1:30:51] to limit our services because I don't
[1:30:52] know who it goes to this isn't for other
[1:30:54] people's congregations it's to us but if
[1:30:57] you're watching and couldn't be here
