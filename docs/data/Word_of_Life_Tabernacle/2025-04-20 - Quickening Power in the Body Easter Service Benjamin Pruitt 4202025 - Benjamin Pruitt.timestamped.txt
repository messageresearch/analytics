[43:41] have a need and something that you
[43:43] believe God can do it, but it just needs
[43:45] to be done. We know he sees every heart,
[43:47] knows every reason behind every lifted
[43:50] hand this morning. Heavenly Father, I
[43:53] pray God that you just move in a mighty
[43:55] way. Lord, move me out of the way. Speak
[43:58] to your people. Lord, I I I'm not
[44:01] sufficient in myself to know what to
[44:03] say, but Lord, you can do it. And I
[44:06] thank you that my life is in your hands,
[44:09] Lord. Lord, I surrender myself into your
[44:11] will in your way today. I pray, God,
[44:14] that you'd you'd bless every person
[44:16] sitting here, Lord. Pray you'd take care
[44:18] of every need, Lord. You know how to
[44:20] meet that need. I don't I would if I
[44:22] could, Lord, but I don't know how. But
[44:24] you do, Lord. you can speak a word in
[44:27] due season, Lord, to the right person at
[44:29] the right time. I pray you'd grant that
[44:32] today. There's a reason why we're here.
[44:34] And I pray that we would fulfill that
[44:36] predestinated purpose this morning. We
[44:39] thank you for all that you've done. We
[44:40] love you. We appreciate your presence in
[44:43] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[44:49] Good to be with each and every one of
[44:51] you this morning. Uh we just uh always
[44:54] enjoy Easter service and being in the
[44:56] house of God on Easter and being with
[44:59] one another on Easter. We'll just have
[45:00] the one service
[45:02] today. So I'll try to maybe not hurry,
[45:06] but we won't keep you all day either. I
[45:08] know you've got dinner plans and things
[45:10] as well. It's good to have our visitors
[45:11] with us. God bless you today. Uh it's
[45:14] good to have Sister Luella. I saw you
[45:15] and Sister Lillian back there. God bless
[45:17] you. Thank you for being here today. And
[45:19] uh each one of you, Jaden back with us.
[45:21] God bless you and Isabella and each one
[45:23] of you that are here. God bless our
[45:25] visitors over here and we're just
[45:27] thankful the Lord has allowed us to be
[45:29] together. I know there's uh uh several
[45:31] out today traveling and different
[45:33] things. We just pray God's blessings on
[45:35] them as well. We're going to turn to
[45:36] Matthew chapter 28 and verse 1. Read
[45:39] from Matthew 28
[45:41] 1-6 and then Romans 8:11. Matthew 28
[45:45] and1 and Romans
[45:58] 8:11 it says in Matthew 28:1 in the end
[46:02] of the
[46:03] Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the
[46:05] first day of the week came Mary
[46:07] Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
[46:10] sephiler and behold there was a great
[46:12] earthquake
[46:14] For the angel of the Lord descended from
[46:16] heaven and came and rolled back the
[46:19] stone from the door and sat upon it. His
[46:22] countenance was like lightning, his
[46:24] arignment white as snow. And for fear of
[46:27] him the keepers did shake and became as
[46:30] dead men. And the angel answered and
[46:32] said unto the women, "Fear not ye, for I
[46:35] know that you seek Jesus which was
[46:38] crucified. He is not here." Aren't you
[46:41] glad for that truth this morning? For he
[46:44] is risen as he said, "Come see the place
[46:48] where the Lord lay." And then Romans
[46:50] chapter 8 and verse
[46:53] 11. But if the spirit of him that raised
[46:57] up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[47:01] you, he that raised up Christ from the
[47:04] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[47:08] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[47:12] you. I pray the Lord would add his
[47:14] blessing to the word. You may be seated
[47:15] this morning.
[47:19] I want to speak to you on quickening
[47:21] power in the
[47:22] body. Our Lord Jesus was born into this
[47:26] world as a human. He didn't come as a
[47:29] superhuman of some kind, some kind of
[47:31] angel, some with some kind of
[47:33] superpower, but he was born into the
[47:36] world. He was born without sin, but he
[47:40] came and bore our sin. The Bible says he
[47:43] hath made him to be sin for us. Oh, that
[47:47] ought to that ought to make us shout
[47:49] this morning. That ought to make us
[47:50] happy that he said heath made him to be
[47:53] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[47:57] be made the righteousness of God in him.
[48:01] In other words, he was created to for
[48:03] the purpose of taking on our sin. He who
[48:06] was sinless that we might be made or
[48:08] created the righteousness of God in him.
[48:12] He was a man when he was born in a
[48:14] manger, helpless. He was a man when he
[48:17] cried at the tomb of Lazarus as that's
[48:19] always been pointed out that he was a
[48:21] man at that time. But he was more than a
[48:24] man when he stood at the grave and he
[48:25] said, "Lazarus, come forth." And a man
[48:28] that had been dead for three days walked
[48:31] out of the tomb. He he was a man when he
[48:35] was sleeping in the boat, as we talked
[48:37] about a couple of weeks ago. But he was
[48:39] more than a man when he stood and put
[48:41] his his foot upon the the bow of the
[48:43] boat and he said, "Peace be still." Yes,
[48:46] sir. He was a man when he lived and and
[48:49] he lived and and died in complete
[48:51] submission to his father. Sir, but he
[48:54] never said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord." Did
[48:57] you know that Jesus never said, "Thus
[48:59] sayaith the Lord." Because he was the
[49:01] Lord. He was God in flesh, the God man.
[49:05] Every bit of man and every bit God.
[49:08] Amen. He was a man when he died on
[49:10] Calvary for a sacrifice for us, taking
[49:14] our sins away. The blood running out of
[49:16] him like any mortal would spit hanging
[49:19] all over his beard where they'd spit on
[49:22] him. He was a man disgraced standing
[49:25] there hanging in shame, taking my place.
[49:30] He was a man when the pains got so great
[49:32] till he cried out, "My God, my God, why
[49:35] hast thou forsaken me?" You imagine the
[49:39] one who had had the closest communion
[49:41] with God that there had ever been on the
[49:43] earth was the son of God as he was on
[49:45] the earth. And yet he had cried out,
[49:47] "Brother Danny, my God, why hast thou
[49:49] forsaken me?" He was a man when he cried
[49:52] and when he died, but he was more than a
[49:54] man when he rose up three days later and
[49:56] he come up out of the grave proving he
[49:58] was God. It was God in him. It was the
[50:01] spirit of God in that man.
[50:05] Hallelujah. He proved on Easter morning
[50:08] that he was more than a man. Easter
[50:09] proves that the that that what we
[50:12] believe is not just a story, but it's a
[50:14] reality. He didn't remain in the tomb,
[50:16] but he's alive forever more. That's the
[50:19] the basic story of Christianity.
[50:23] He had the spirit of God in him. And in
[50:26] 2 Corinthians 5:1 17, he says,
[50:29] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[50:32] is a new creature." We're going to come
[50:33] back to the scripture later. He said,
[50:35] "Old things are passed away. Behold, all
[50:38] things," someone say, all things are
[50:40] become new. And all things are of God,
[50:43] who hath reconciled us to himself by
[50:46] Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the
[50:49] ministry of
[50:51] reconciliation to that God was in
[50:54] Christ. This is the min ministry of
[50:57] reconciliation, the gospel of the
[50:59] kingdom. That God was in Christ
[51:01] reconciling the world unto himself. Not
[51:05] imputing, oh, I'm so glad. Not imputing
[51:08] their trespasses unto them. It means not
[51:11] putting it to their account, not
[51:14] counting it to them, not counting their
[51:16] trespasses or their sins unto them, and
[51:18] hath committed unto us the word of
[51:21] reconciliation. He was born without sin.
[51:24] We were born shaped by sin, yet he took
[51:27] our sin upon himself. Thank you, Lord.
[51:30] In Romans 7, Paul talks about the
[51:34] struggle of a believer and that every
[51:36] one of us have with the flesh, the human
[51:39] part. And again, Jesus was born without
[51:42] sin. And yet in many things, in fact,
[51:44] the Bible says in all things, in all
[51:46] points, he was tempted like we are. And
[51:49] we find that we live in a body that has
[51:52] certain things that cause us to uh do
[51:55] certain things. And and you know, if
[51:57] people speak to you in a certain way,
[51:59] your feelings get hurt. And you you
[52:01] might prepare yourself for that and try
[52:03] everything, but you you got a body, you
[52:05] got a spirit, you got a flesh that it
[52:08] gets hurt. And you build complexes and
[52:10] things happen and because we're human
[52:12] and and and we get sideways with one
[52:15] another and cross with one another
[52:17] because we're human. It's very human to
[52:19] do that. In fact, even in our own
[52:20] selves, Paul says, "I find a law that
[52:23] when I would do good, evil is present
[52:25] with me." So whenever I want to try to
[52:28] do the right thing and I try to live for
[52:30] the Lord, and I do every bit as good as
[52:32] I can do, and yet it seems like the
[52:34] devil's right there to try to take that
[52:36] away from me and and try to bring me
[52:38] down. That's his job, isn't it? We heard
[52:40] about it. But I want to discourage the
[52:42] devil today. I want to give the devil
[52:43] some anxiety and and get make him
[52:46] nervous this morning because we know
[52:48] that he is overcome by the blood of the
[52:50] lamb and by the word of our testimony.
[52:53] He we are overcomers this morning. We
[52:55] are not some weak people that cannot
[52:57] overcome that have to give in to every
[52:59] whim and every wow of the devil. But we
[53:01] have the mind of Christ to know what to
[53:03] do with the word and how to live in our
[53:05] present situation. Amen.
[53:08] He said, "I find then a law. When I
[53:10] would do good, evil is present with me.
[53:12] For I delight in the law of God after
[53:15] the inward man, but I see another law in
[53:18] my members, in my flesh, waring against
[53:22] the law of my mind, and bringing me into
[53:24] captivity to the law of sin, which is in
[53:27] my members." And he says, "Oh wretched
[53:30] man that I am, who shall deliver me from
[53:35] the body of this death?" And the image
[53:37] there is of a man. They would actually
[53:39] take a condemned prisoner. And one one
[53:42] of the ways they would kill a man is
[53:43] they would take a dead man and strap
[53:45] him, chain him to a live man. And the
[53:47] live the the dead body would actually
[53:50] cause the live person to die. It's a
[53:53] gruesome thing, but it's one of the ways
[53:54] that they actually would would punish a
[53:56] person because it would just cause the
[53:59] the flesh of the of the dead man would
[54:01] rot and things and it would cause the
[54:03] the the live man to be infected. And
[54:06] here I have a live man, a new creature
[54:09] in Christ. And it seems like that old
[54:10] dead man is just wrapped around it. and
[54:13] seems like he's just always he's always
[54:15] there and he's always giving me trouble
[54:17] and he's always making me sick or he's
[54:20] always making me worried or he's always
[54:22] making me doubt the word. But I'm here
[54:23] to tell you today, you don't have to
[54:25] give into that. You don't have to. Come
[54:27] on, church. What does Paul say? He said,
[54:29] he said, "Who shall deliver me from the
[54:31] body of this death?" But I'm so glad he
[54:33] didn't stop there. But he said, "I thank
[54:35] God through Jesus Christ our Lord." So
[54:38] then with the mind I serve the law of
[54:39] God, but with the flesh the law of sin,
[54:42] right?
[54:43] But Paul goes on, he doesn't stop there.
[54:45] You know, the chapters we put are for
[54:46] ease of memorization and things in the
[54:48] Bible, but Paul's writing a letter. He
[54:51] doesn't stop with chap with verse 25,
[54:54] but he goes on to chapter 8. He said,
[54:56] "There is therefore
[54:58] now no condemnation to them which are in
[55:02] Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
[55:05] flesh, but after the spirit." So, it's
[55:07] telling us that the flesh is not an
[55:09] excuse to to live any way we want to.
[55:11] But there is no condemnation to those.
[55:14] You can live in a in a way that causes
[55:16] you to be free from sin. Not because
[55:18] you'll never make a mistake, but because
[55:20] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you
[55:22] from all sin. And you can live in such a
[55:25] way till the devil don't even know what
[55:27] to do with you. And when your feet get
[55:29] up in the morning, it makes the devil
[55:30] tremble. We don't teach a weak gospel,
[55:33] but a strong one. We don't teach a weak
[55:35] blood, but a strong one. We don't teach
[55:37] a powerless God, but a powerful God.
[55:40] Amen.
[55:41] [Applause]
[55:42] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, he said, "To them
[55:46] which are in Christ Jesus, there's no
[55:48] condemnation, no, no, no judgment. To
[55:51] them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk
[55:53] not after the flesh, but after the
[55:56] spirit." For the law of the spirit of
[55:58] life in Christ Jesus, listen, has made
[56:01] me free from the law of sin and death.
[56:05] Right? Here was this law of sin working
[56:07] in my members, but he's made me free
[56:08] from it. Not that the flesh would be
[56:10] saved. We know there will come and we'll
[56:12] get to that maybe later. There will come
[56:13] a change of the body. But but yet here I
[56:16] I while I'm here, I can live like a
[56:19] Christian. I can do what God wants me to
[56:21] do. No matter what my past was, no
[56:22] matter what my family history was, no
[56:25] matter what I come out of, because if
[56:27] any man be in Christ, he's a new
[56:28] creature. And if anybody would know
[56:30] that, Paul would. He knew what he was.
[56:32] He knew he was a murderer. He knew what
[56:34] his past was. He knew what he had been
[56:36] through. But he knew that the grace of
[56:37] God could save him from sin. Completely
[56:40] bring him new again. Amen. What's the
[56:43] word we preach? A power not that we have
[56:45] to excuse sin, but we believe in a blood
[56:47] that cleanses from sin. Makes you walk
[56:50] different.
[56:52] Hallelujah. I believe God can do that on
[56:54] an Easter Sunday. Don't you? Don't you
[56:56] believe God? Some of you are witnesses
[56:58] today that God can do that. Sister
[57:00] Stephanie's a witness. Brother Trip's a
[57:01] witness. Sister Anna's a witness. I
[57:03] remember the Easter Sunday. Sister Anna
[57:05] come down to the altar and gave her
[57:07] heart to the Lord when Emma was just a
[57:09] little bitty girl. I remember it. I can
[57:11] remember that morning cuz God changed
[57:13] her life and made her new. And he's
[57:15] still the same God this morning. He's
[57:17] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[57:20] Hallelujah. You don't have to give in to
[57:22] suicide. You don't have to give in to
[57:24] depression. You don't have to give in to
[57:26] the things of the world. You don't have
[57:27] to give in say, "Well, my life is
[57:28] hopeless." There's a blood that can
[57:30] change you this morning and make you
[57:32] new.
[57:34] Hallelujah.
[57:37] For what the law could not do. I've got
[57:39] this. I had this made right here.
[57:41] Son-in-law made it for me and it's it's
[57:42] back on my wall. For the He said what
[57:45] the law could not do and that it was
[57:46] weak through the flesh. God sending his
[57:49] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[57:52] And for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[57:55] that the righteousness of the law might
[57:56] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[58:00] the flesh but after the spirit. For they
[58:02] that are after the flesh do mind the
[58:03] things of the flesh, but they that are
[58:05] after the spirit the things of the
[58:07] spirit. For to be carnally minded is
[58:09] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[58:11] life and peace. Because the carnal mind
[58:13] is enmity against God. So you don't want
[58:16] to remain a carnal believer. You don't
[58:18] want to remain a person who just remains
[58:20] in that condition. And you say, "Well, I
[58:22] know Jesus raised from the dead, but but
[58:24] here I'm fighting my flesh and I just
[58:26] I'm just staying here and I'm just going
[58:27] to live here." You don't want to live in
[58:29] that place. a carnal mind who's immity
[58:31] against God. You'll come to church and
[58:32] you'll be under such conviction. You'll
[58:34] say, "Well, I just don't want to go back
[58:35] anymore." That's not the answer. The
[58:37] answer is to surrender to the word and
[58:39] say, "Lord, let fill me with your spirit
[58:41] so I can live the right kind of a life."
[58:44] That's right. That's good.
[58:47] He said, "So then, they that are in the
[58:48] flesh cannot please
[58:50] God, but you are not in the flesh."
[58:53] Thank you, Hallelujah. but in the
[58:56] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[58:58] dwell in you. He said, "Now if any man
[59:00] have not the spirit of Christ, he is
[59:01] none of his." And if Christ be in you,
[59:04] the body is dead because of sin, but the
[59:06] spirit is life because of righteousness.
[59:08] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[59:11] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[59:13] that raised up Christ from the dead
[59:15] shall also, and this is what we're going
[59:17] to approach now this morning, he will
[59:19] also quicken, that's make alive, your
[59:21] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[59:24] dwelleth. Amen. In you. Amen. It will
[59:27] quicken. He will quicken your mortal
[59:29] bodies. A mortal body is a literally a
[59:31] body subject to death. He will quicken
[59:34] your body subject to death and make it
[59:37] live. Ephesians 2 and1 tells us now we
[59:40] know he's not just talking about the
[59:42] resurrection because there will be a
[59:43] resurrection of the body. But that's not
[59:45] what he's talking about in its entirety
[59:47] here. He's talking about a quickening
[59:49] that takes place in the soul that causes
[59:52] you to have uh a dominion over the works
[59:55] of the flesh. Ephesians 2:1, he said,
[59:58] "And you hath he quickened." We could
[1:00:00] read that. Me hath he quickened, right?
[1:00:03] "Me hath he quickened, who were dead in
[1:00:05] trespasses and sins, wherein in time
[1:00:08] past you walked according to the course
[1:00:11] of this world." Everybody thinks they
[1:00:13] got to do everything the world does.
[1:00:15] Well, that's what people do before
[1:00:17] they're quickened. That's right. Right.
[1:00:19] And we don't condemn the sinner because
[1:00:20] the sinner just does what sinner what a
[1:00:22] sinner does. But once a person's been
[1:00:25] quickened, things change. Right. Once
[1:00:27] they've been made alive, things change.
[1:00:30] Hallelujah. So before the quickening,
[1:00:33] you are bound by the laws the the law of
[1:00:37] nature and the law of sin. But after the
[1:00:39] quickening, you can do all things
[1:00:41] through God who strengthens you. How
[1:00:43] many believe that today? And it's not
[1:00:45] that you don't deal with the flesh
[1:00:46] anymore, but there is a power within you
[1:00:49] that if you surrender to it, it can grow
[1:00:51] to a spot until you you actually have
[1:00:54] dominion over that flesh.
[1:00:58] So he said, "Wherein in time past you
[1:01:00] walked according to the course of this
[1:01:01] world, according to the prince of the
[1:01:02] power of the air, that's Satan, the
[1:01:04] spirit that now workketh in the children
[1:01:06] of
[1:01:07] disobedience, among whom also we all."
[1:01:10] Right? So we don't condemn the sinner
[1:01:12] because we were all that way. That's
[1:01:13] right. We all had our lifestyle, our
[1:01:15] conversation in times past in the lust
[1:01:17] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[1:01:19] the flesh and of the mind. And we're by
[1:01:21] nature the children of wrath even as
[1:01:23] others. But God, oh, I love this verse.
[1:01:27] I I can just read this scripture and be
[1:01:29] happy this morning because I know it's
[1:01:31] written by by the inspiration of God.
[1:01:33] But God, who is rich in mercy, for his
[1:01:36] great love wherewith he loved us. Aren't
[1:01:38] you glad he's rich in mercy today. He's
[1:01:41] not poor. He's not waiting to dole it
[1:01:43] out in little measures, but he's willing
[1:01:45] to give you all the mercy you need to be
[1:01:48] able to live a victorious life. Thank
[1:01:49] you, Lord. even when we were dead in
[1:01:51] sins, hath quickened us together with
[1:01:54] Christ. So, as Christ is raised, we're
[1:01:56] raised with him. By grace you are saved,
[1:01:58] and hath raised us up together. Notice
[1:02:00] he says, "Hath raised us past tense and
[1:02:02] made us sit together in heavenly places
[1:02:05] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:02:07] he might show the exceeding riches of
[1:02:10] his grace in his kindness toward us
[1:02:12] through Christ Jesus. He has quickened
[1:02:15] our
[1:02:16] mortal bodies."
[1:02:19] Brother Brandon puts it this way. He
[1:02:20] said, "If it dwells in your mortal
[1:02:21] bodies, now watch it also quickens,
[1:02:23] brings to life, makes it subject to the
[1:02:26] word." What word? The Bible. The word of
[1:02:29] God. That's right. Are you with me now?
[1:02:32] Because what we believe is the Bible.
[1:02:34] The word for our day. That's right. The
[1:02:37] word revealed for our day. So, he
[1:02:38] quickens you to the what the word says
[1:02:42] if his spirit dwells in you. Now, we
[1:02:44] know that that quickening is a
[1:02:46] quickening spirit. In fact, Paul says in
[1:02:48] 1 Corinthians 15:45 that the first man,
[1:02:51] Adam, was made a living soul. But the
[1:02:53] last Adam, was made a quickening spirit,
[1:02:56] a quickening spirit, a living spirit, a
[1:02:58] spirit that makes alive. And it was that
[1:03:01] quickening spirit in the body of the son
[1:03:03] that raised him from the dead. It was
[1:03:05] the quickening spirit in my body, in
[1:03:07] your body, that brought you from death
[1:03:10] to life. And it'll be that same
[1:03:11] quickening spirit that changes your body
[1:03:14] one day. 1 Corinthians 15:51, "Behold, I
[1:03:17] show you a mystery. We shall not all
[1:03:19] sleep, but we shall all be changed in a
[1:03:22] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[1:03:24] the last trump. For the trumpet shall
[1:03:26] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[1:03:27] incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
[1:03:30] I'm just, you can call me crazy if you
[1:03:32] want to, but I'm just crazy enough to
[1:03:34] believe that God keeps his word. If he
[1:03:36] raised Jesus from the dead, he'll also
[1:03:38] raise these mortal bodies, quicken us
[1:03:41] one day, and change our bodies. Paul
[1:03:43] said, "We won't all fall asleep. We
[1:03:45] won't all go to the grave, but some of
[1:03:46] us will be alive.
[1:03:48] I I want to be one of those. Right? And
[1:03:51] if it's not me, let it be my children.
[1:03:53] If not them, then their children. But
[1:03:54] until that day, let me be awake and
[1:03:56] ready for him to come, watching for his
[1:03:59] coming.
[1:04:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, so he says
[1:04:05] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[1:04:06] at the last trump, for the trumpet shall
[1:04:08] sound, the dead shall be raised
[1:04:09] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[1:04:11] Brother Brandham calls this quickening
[1:04:14] power. This quickening spirit is
[1:04:16] quickening power. The power to give life
[1:04:19] to dead things. You can go to John
[1:04:20] chapter 1 and he said in the beginning
[1:04:22] was the word and the word was with God
[1:04:23] and the word was God. And he said he
[1:04:25] gave them power to become to them that
[1:04:27] believed on his name. He gave them power
[1:04:29] to become the sons of God. Right? And
[1:04:32] that was the quickening power that come
[1:04:33] in us to become the sons and daughters
[1:04:36] of God. Aren't you glad for that this
[1:04:37] morning? None of our own efforts. Right.
[1:04:41] Right. Not not by efforts. You can't
[1:04:42] make yourself a son or daughter of God,
[1:04:45] but by his choosing and by his
[1:04:47] quickening power. So all you got to do
[1:04:49] is surrender to it, church. It's not
[1:04:51] working it up. It's not trying to You
[1:04:53] say, "Well, I didn't have an experience
[1:04:54] like this person did." That's not what
[1:04:56] it's about. But it's about the
[1:04:57] quickening power coming in and changing
[1:05:00] your life and seeing that you're what
[1:05:02] you were and what you are today. Amen.
[1:05:04] How you've changed.
[1:05:06] Power gives life to dead things.
[1:05:11] Now, if you go to 2 Kings chapter 13
[1:05:15] and verse 20, and this is where my
[1:05:18] thought come from this morning as I was
[1:05:20] just pondering these things through the
[1:05:22] week. And I read a quote last week that
[1:05:24] reminded me of these
[1:05:26] things. And in 2 Kings 13:20, we find
[1:05:30] the prophet Elisha died and they buried
[1:05:33] him. And the bands of the Moabites
[1:05:35] invaded the land at the coming end of
[1:05:37] the year. Now Elijah's life had been a a
[1:05:41] series of of lifegiving events. He had
[1:05:44] he he had especially with the Shounomite
[1:05:46] woman. He he'd given life to you know
[1:05:49] they didn't have a baby and she'd give
[1:05:51] him a place to stay and he told his
[1:05:53] servants said find out what she wants.
[1:05:55] And he said you know he said they say
[1:05:56] they don't want anything but they
[1:05:58] they've been all their life and you live
[1:06:00] together and they don't have a baby. He
[1:06:01] said well God's going to give them a
[1:06:03] baby. And he prophesied that to him and
[1:06:05] the baby was born. And then about uh you
[1:06:08] know about uh about 12 years later we
[1:06:11] know the baby
[1:06:12] died. But but there was such quickening
[1:06:14] power that the baby was raised again.
[1:06:17] But let's go back to second Kings 13 21.
[1:06:20] Now Elisha is dead. So he's had that
[1:06:22] kind of a miraculous ministry. A double
[1:06:25] portion of what Elijah had. Elisha had
[1:06:28] remember Elijah is a type of Christ but
[1:06:30] Elisha is a type of the bride of the
[1:06:32] church, the true church, right? because
[1:06:35] that's what uh that's the ones that uh
[1:06:37] go by way of the grave. One went up into
[1:06:39] the heaven, one went by way of the
[1:06:41] grave. And yet they both made it. So
[1:06:43] Elisha had that quickening power. The
[1:06:45] same quickening power that took Elijah
[1:06:47] up in a chariot of fire was the same
[1:06:49] quickening power, quickening spirit that
[1:06:51] caused Elisha when he was laying in the
[1:06:54] grave. Now it said it came to pass as
[1:06:56] they were
[1:06:57] beyond men and they cast a man into the
[1:07:00] septic of Elisha. And when the man was
[1:07:02] let down and touched the bones of
[1:07:05] Elisha, he revived and stood up on his
[1:07:11] feet. Now, there's there's something
[1:07:13] almost comical about this story cuz
[1:07:16] these guys are running for their life,
[1:07:19] right? And they come across a grave and
[1:07:22] they're carrying a dead man. They want
[1:07:24] to bury him. You know, give him a good
[1:07:25] burial, but you know, that all kind of
[1:07:27] goes away when you're about to die
[1:07:28] yourself, you know? They're getting
[1:07:30] chased by a bunch of Moabites. So they
[1:07:32] take the dead men to carry and say,
[1:07:33] "Well, here's a tomb. Bury him here and
[1:07:35] throw him in." And when they throw him
[1:07:38] in, he stands up.
[1:07:42] Hey guys, come. You know, you see him
[1:07:44] running and he's running after him. You
[1:07:46] know, wait for me.
[1:07:50] You were dead for hours. What happened
[1:07:52] to you? Well, oh my. What happened is he
[1:07:56] touched the bones of a dead prophet.
[1:08:01] Now you think about it. That prophet had
[1:08:02] to have been there for at least two
[1:08:04] years.
[1:08:05] For all the flesh to be gone, it'd be
[1:08:07] just bones.
[1:08:10] Just bones was all that was left of him.
[1:08:13] And here he was with just the bones. The
[1:08:16] spirit was gone. The soul was gone. The
[1:08:18] body was gone. All that was left was the
[1:08:21] bones of Elisha. And yet there was
[1:08:24] enough power in them bones.
[1:08:27] Yes.
[1:08:29] Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] When a dead man touched him, come on
[1:08:33] now. He come back to life. Now, that's
[1:08:36] not superstition. That's the Bible.
[1:08:39] So, we find then that that's that was
[1:08:40] the same power that was in Elisha's
[1:08:42] ministry. Remember in how the baby was
[1:08:44] raised up. You remember the baby that
[1:08:46] the the Shunimite woman come remember
[1:08:49] when the when when he died, he went out
[1:08:51] when he was 12 years old with his father
[1:08:52] in the field. He had a heat stroke and
[1:08:54] he died and and she laid him in the
[1:08:57] upstairs bedroom in Elijah's Elisha's
[1:08:59] bedroom and she run she got on her
[1:09:02] donkey and she went just as fast as she
[1:09:04] could for the man of God. And her
[1:09:06] husband said, "Why are you going to
[1:09:07] church today?" He said, "There's it's
[1:09:09] not a new moon or a holy day. It's not
[1:09:11] Christmas or Easter and you're here.
[1:09:13] You're going to church." And she said,
[1:09:15] "It is well." So she heads on up to the
[1:09:18] to the place where Elisha was. And and
[1:09:21] when she gets there, he sees her a
[1:09:22] little ways off. And he said, he said,
[1:09:24] "Go find out what's wrong with her." He
[1:09:26] said, "Because I don't know. The Lord
[1:09:27] has hid it from me." And here she come.
[1:09:30] And and the servant asked her, said, "Is
[1:09:32] everything okay? Is everything all
[1:09:34] right?" And she said, "All is well."
[1:09:36] Why? She'd reached the prophet. She knew
[1:09:38] everything was going to be all right
[1:09:40] because she believed that he was a man
[1:09:41] of God. That there was something. It was
[1:09:43] more than a man that was there. He was
[1:09:45] just a normal man who lived and died
[1:09:47] like everybody else. But there was a God
[1:09:49] in that man.
[1:09:51] Hallelujah. Remember our text. If that
[1:09:53] same spirit that dwelt in Christ dwell
[1:09:56] in you, it'll quicken your mortal
[1:09:58] bodies. If that same spirit that dwelled
[1:10:00] in Elijah dwelled in Elisha, it would
[1:10:02] quicken this boy. That's right. She
[1:10:05] believed it.
[1:10:07] But she had faith in in a certain way.
[1:10:09] And many times we criticize how someone
[1:10:12] is saved or someone is healed, but it's
[1:10:14] just whatever way you your faith works.
[1:10:17] Some people work by laying on of hands.
[1:10:19] Others you can just speak to them and
[1:10:20] they hear it preached and immediately
[1:10:22] they're healed or they're saved. Others
[1:10:24] they have to study in the scripture and
[1:10:26] they're more tuned that way and they can
[1:10:27] be saved just by or heal maybe by
[1:10:29] reading the word or whatever that it is
[1:10:31] or by prayer. But there's different ways
[1:10:33] that people come to God. And here we
[1:10:36] know that that Elijah or Elisha sent uh
[1:10:39] Gahhesi back with his staff, laid his
[1:10:41] staff on the child, but she didn't have
[1:10:43] any faith in the staff. She wanted the
[1:10:46] prophet. So finally the prophet came and
[1:10:48] the Bible says that when Elisha was come
[1:10:50] into the house 2 Kings 4:32 behold the
[1:10:53] child was dead and laid upon his bed. He
[1:10:56] went in therefore and shut the door upon
[1:10:57] them twain and prayed unto the Lord. He
[1:11:00] went up and lay upon the child, put his
[1:11:02] mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his
[1:11:04] eyes, his hands upon his hands, and he
[1:11:06] stretched himself upon the child, and
[1:11:08] the flesh of the child waxed warm. What
[1:11:11] was it? Quickening power in the body.
[1:11:14] And I'm going somewhere this morning.
[1:11:16] Quickening power in the body of Elisha
[1:11:19] that caused that baby to come back to
[1:11:21] life, that young man. He said, "Then he
[1:11:23] returned and walked in the house to and
[1:11:25] fro and went up and stretched himself
[1:11:27] upon him, and the child sneezed seven
[1:11:29] times, and the child opened his eyes."
[1:11:31] Brother Brandham said, "When when Elisha
[1:11:34] called on a case where there was a
[1:11:35] prophet, there laid a dead baby walked
[1:11:36] up and down the floor. What was it? man
[1:11:38] walking but all at once he felt the
[1:11:40] anointing come on him and he stretched
[1:11:42] himself across the baby and he sneezed
[1:11:44] seven times and come to life. What was
[1:11:45] that? God in his people.
[1:11:49] Right? So that quickening power was not
[1:11:52] only in Christ but it had been in the
[1:11:53] prophets. Now Elisha died and again it
[1:11:57] took about two years before a person
[1:11:59] becomes just bones. His flesh was
[1:12:01] completely gone, but the quickening
[1:12:04] power was still in the body even though
[1:12:06] it had gone back to the dust. And what
[1:12:08] was happening is he was waiting on the
[1:12:10] resurrection. So a dead man thrown on
[1:12:13] top of those bones, he come back to
[1:12:15] life. A man, think about it now just
[1:12:18] deeply for a moment. A man that was
[1:12:21] buried with a prophet came back to life.
[1:12:25] But let me tell you who you're buried
[1:12:27] with today.
[1:12:29] Come on, church. The Bible says we are
[1:12:31] buried by baptism into Christ. So we are
[1:12:35] not buried with a prophet, but we
[1:12:38] Hallelujah. We are buried with Christ.
[1:12:41] Romans 6 and4. Therefore, we are buried
[1:12:44] with him by baptism. Oh, come on. They
[1:12:47] threw a dead body into Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:50] Into the water. And you come up out of
[1:12:52] the water and you receive the baptism of
[1:12:54] the Holy Ghost. Quickening power came
[1:12:55] in. Glory to God. Therefore, we are
[1:12:58] buried with him by baptism into death.
[1:13:00] That like as Christ was raised up from
[1:13:02] the dead by the glory of the father,
[1:13:04] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:13:06] of life, buried with him in baptism,
[1:13:09] wherein also you are risen with him
[1:13:11] through the faith of the operation of
[1:13:12] God who hath raised him from the dead.
[1:13:14] You got to die to yourself. You got to
[1:13:16] die to your old ways, die to the old
[1:13:18] man. Listen, it's not the baptism that
[1:13:20] saves you. But when you're buried with
[1:13:22] him, you come up because you touch the
[1:13:24] quickening power by faith in his word.
[1:13:26] Amen.
[1:13:28] Hallelujah.
[1:13:30] Hallelujah. Buried with him in baptized
[1:13:32] wherein also you are in baptism wherein
[1:13:35] also you are risen with him through the
[1:13:37] faith of the operation of God who hath
[1:13:38] raised him from the dead. We have been
[1:13:41] raised with him. Right? There was
[1:13:44] quickening power in the body and that
[1:13:49] same quickening power quickens these
[1:13:51] mortal bodies and they are made subject
[1:13:54] to the word. Now I want to talk to you
[1:13:57] just a little bit on Easter Sunday
[1:13:59] morning. I want us to understand that we
[1:14:02] we don't use excuses when it comes to
[1:14:04] the gospel. If if I can't live it, it's
[1:14:06] not the gospel's fault,
[1:14:09] right? It's not the quickening power's
[1:14:10] fault. I just need to surrender to it
[1:14:13] more. Right? It's not. And so we don't
[1:14:16] make excuses for that. And yet we
[1:14:18] condemn nobody.
[1:14:21] But we make no excuses. Are you with me
[1:14:24] now? Because we realize anybody can be
[1:14:26] quickened to life. But we're not going
[1:14:28] to make any excuses for the way a person
[1:14:30] is. Because Paul says, "Therefore, if
[1:14:33] any man be in Christ, he is a new
[1:14:35] creature. The word is new creation. Old
[1:14:38] things are passed away. Behold, all
[1:14:40] things are become new. And think of it,
[1:14:42] you're not then then not yourself.
[1:14:44] You're a new creature. The Greek means a
[1:14:46] new creation. You've been recreated
[1:14:48] again. The power of God comes upon you
[1:14:52] and you become created a new creature
[1:14:55] which brings the whole physical being,
[1:14:59] spiritual being and everything in
[1:15:02] subject to the word of God. Not no other
[1:15:05] way. Now, now think about it. If you
[1:15:08] really believed that, if you really
[1:15:09] understood that sickness comes in the
[1:15:12] body, right? And it and the devil has a
[1:15:15] right to that's the world we live in to
[1:15:18] bring sickness on the body, but we don't
[1:15:20] have to let it stay there,
[1:15:23] right? And you say, "Well, the s I still
[1:15:24] feel sick." But if you believe your
[1:15:27] sickness can leave you. Well, how do you
[1:15:29] know that? And and and it's not that a
[1:15:30] person would never be sick or would
[1:15:32] never have to deal with that. It may
[1:15:34] take a day. It may be instant. It may
[1:15:37] take a year. It may take a 25 years like
[1:15:39] Abraham took to receive the promise. But
[1:15:42] if you believe, you can have what you
[1:15:44] believe. Why? Because the quickening the
[1:15:47] body is subject to the quickening power.
[1:15:50] See, your body can be when when when you
[1:15:52] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, your
[1:15:54] body can become subject to your words.
[1:16:01] That's why we don't say, "I'm I'm not a
[1:16:03] Christian."
[1:16:04] Right? We don't say, "I'm I'm a bad I,
[1:16:06] you know, I'm I'm a kind of a bad
[1:16:08] Christian. I don't do what I should and
[1:16:09] all this stuff." If if you're if you're
[1:16:11] not where you should be, confess it and
[1:16:13] move on, right? Don't dwell in that
[1:16:16] place. Cuz when you put yourself down
[1:16:18] all the time, what you're doing is
[1:16:19] you're making your body obey your
[1:16:21] confession.
[1:16:22] But if you would say, "I'm covered by
[1:16:24] the blood of Jesus Christ. Yes, I've
[1:16:26] made mistakes, but they're under the
[1:16:28] blood. Things are different now from
[1:16:29] what they were." And anytime the devil
[1:16:31] tries to bring condemnation on you, what
[1:16:33] do you do? you speak in your body
[1:16:35] becomes what you speak. Amen. I know
[1:16:38] that sounds crazy, but that's what the
[1:16:40] scripture teaches that whatever you ask.
[1:16:44] He said, "In my name, you can have it."
[1:16:48] Are you with me now? But it only works
[1:16:50] when we surrender to his spirit in us.
[1:16:52] That's not our power that does that.
[1:16:55] That's right. It's his spirit in us. So,
[1:16:58] our bodies become subject to the word.
[1:17:00] So, but it just doesn't work with
[1:17:01] healing. But it also works with uh with
[1:17:03] habits, with things that come in our
[1:17:05] life. You say, "Well, I just can't do
[1:17:07] it. I just can't live the word. I can't
[1:17:09] live according to the Bible." I'm here
[1:17:11] to tell you this morning, yes, you can.
[1:17:14] Yes, you can. How do you know that,
[1:17:16] brother Ben? Because I know that I can
[1:17:18] because he said I can do all things
[1:17:19] through him that strengthens me. He
[1:17:21] wouldn't give me a word and tell me to
[1:17:23] live it and then leave me in a place
[1:17:24] where I couldn't do it. But he said,
[1:17:25] "I'm going to pour my spirit out on
[1:17:27] you." He told the disciples, he said,
[1:17:29] "Don't," he he he said, "don't go out
[1:17:31] and testify right away." He said,
[1:17:33] "You're going to be witnesses to me, but
[1:17:34] go up into Samaria Maria." He said, "Go
[1:17:36] into the temple and wait there until
[1:17:38] you're endued with power from on high."
[1:17:42] Are you with me now?
[1:17:45] So, we have to have that same
[1:17:46] experience. Now, for Paul says, see,
[1:17:50] this is how we get in the body. The
[1:17:51] power is in the
[1:17:53] body, right? That's why I know people
[1:17:55] don't want to have church no more. don't
[1:17:57] want to come to church and things, but
[1:17:58] the power is in the body. That's right.
[1:18:01] Right. That's in the body. It's a
[1:18:04] spirit. And they say trying to separate.
[1:18:05] Why? Because it knows when there's more
[1:18:07] licks of fire get together, there's a
[1:18:09] bigger flame. Brother Brandon said, "You
[1:18:11] can't be as good a Christian and not go
[1:18:13] to church." Right? The Bible tells us
[1:18:16] that not to not forsake the assembling
[1:18:18] of ourselves together. You're all here
[1:18:19] this morning, so I'm not preaching at
[1:18:20] you. But but but why are we told that?
[1:18:23] Because the power is in the body. The
[1:18:26] power is in these bodies individually
[1:18:28] and in this body collectively, not just
[1:18:30] this church, but the body of Christ all
[1:18:32] around the world. Right? But when we
[1:18:34] gather together, he said where two or
[1:18:36] three are gathered together in my name,
[1:18:38] there will I be in the midst of them.
[1:18:41] That's a promise. We can take it to the
[1:18:43] bank. We can we can we can stake our
[1:18:45] soul on that. If he said that he would
[1:18:47] be here, then he is here this morning
[1:18:50] because we're gathered in his name. And
[1:18:52] wherever he is, all things are possible.
[1:18:56] Now, see, but how do we get in the body?
[1:18:59] By one spirit. 1 Corinthians 12:13. Are
[1:19:01] we all baptized into one body? Someone
[1:19:05] say with me, one body.
[1:19:07] Right? That's why we don't we don't sit
[1:19:09] around talking about other churches and
[1:19:11] running them down. And other believers,
[1:19:13] we don't run them down. We're baptized
[1:19:14] into how many bodies? One body. Right?
[1:19:18] We're just a part of the body. We're not
[1:19:20] all of it. We're just a part of the body
[1:19:22] in Hardy, Arkansas. But if there's a
[1:19:23] church across town that believes these
[1:19:25] things, they're a part of the body. If
[1:19:27] there's a church around the world that
[1:19:28] believes what the Bible teaches, they're
[1:19:30] part of the body. Are you with me now?
[1:19:33] So, we are all baptized into one body,
[1:19:35] whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[1:19:37] we be bond or free, and have been all
[1:19:40] made to drink into one spirit. Romans
[1:19:44] 8:1 said, "After," Brother Bren said,
[1:19:46] "After you're in this body, there is
[1:19:47] therefore now." Someone say now no
[1:19:50] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:19:52] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:19:54] after the spirit. There is a place where
[1:19:55] there's no condemnation. Whether you go
[1:19:57] to a Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian
[1:19:59] church, wherever it is, if you're in
[1:20:01] Christ, you're a new creature. That's
[1:20:03] what's important is if you're in Christ.
[1:20:05] If you're in Christ, you're going to
[1:20:06] seek out the word. If you're in Christ,
[1:20:08] you're going to get away from
[1:20:09] denominational walls. If you're in
[1:20:11] Christ, you're going to do what God
[1:20:12] said. But it doesn't matter what kind of
[1:20:14] a house you're born in. What matters is
[1:20:16] that you are born and made a new
[1:20:18] creature in Christ. That you're baptized
[1:20:21] into the body. He said that's God's
[1:20:24] meeting place. God's meeting place is
[1:20:26] not a place, a physical place, but it's
[1:20:29] in Christ. That's where God meets the
[1:20:32] worshipper. He said, "There is where you
[1:20:33] are accounted a new creature, for
[1:20:35] they're dead to the things of the world.
[1:20:36] They're alive in him. The living
[1:20:38] presence of God is with them day by
[1:20:41] day." And so, we know that we can
[1:20:43] overcome. What a great victory that
[1:20:44] ought to be to us today. What a great
[1:20:46] challenge that ought to be to our lives.
[1:20:48] I can overcome. You young people, you
[1:20:50] know, you can say, "I can overcome. I'm
[1:20:52] going to make it. I'm going to be okay.
[1:20:54] The world's crazy." And I hear all kinds
[1:20:56] of bad things and negative things.
[1:20:58] Listen, anybody can tell you what's
[1:20:59] going on in the world. You don't need a
[1:21:01] preacher to tell you what's negative
[1:21:02] right now. You can read the newspaper
[1:21:04] and see that there's all kinds of things
[1:21:06] going on. You can look at your neighbors
[1:21:08] and see that the world's gone crazy.
[1:21:09] Some of y'all's neighbors anyway. But
[1:21:11] you can look around you and see that
[1:21:13] even in the even in the small towns of
[1:21:15] this world, there's crime everywhere.
[1:21:17] There's trouble everywhere. There's
[1:21:19] perversion everywhere. But here in the
[1:21:21] body of Christ, there is a perfect bride
[1:21:24] without spot or wrinkle. Amen. Not
[1:21:26] because of their flesh, but by his
[1:21:28] perfection been washed in the blood of
[1:21:30] the lamb.
[1:21:32] Are you with me now? So you can make it.
[1:21:36] I go further than that. You're going to
[1:21:37] make it. I can say that with full
[1:21:40] assurance. I get worried sometimes.
[1:21:42] Sometimes I stay up late at night and
[1:21:44] uh this morning about 3:00 I woke up and
[1:21:47] I didn't go back to bed. I just laid
[1:21:48] there and thinking praying for some of
[1:21:50] you and praying thinking, "God, uh Lord,
[1:21:52] I I just want to see them get it. I just
[1:21:55] want to see them worship. I just want to
[1:21:56] see them helped. I I want to see their
[1:21:58] families helped and things like that."
[1:22:00] And as I'm laying there and I'm
[1:22:02] concerned about it, it come to me. It's
[1:22:04] not up to me, but it's according to the
[1:22:06] word. That seed that God planted in your
[1:22:08] life will come to pass. All I got to do
[1:22:10] is water it. All I got to do is is work
[1:22:13] and do my part. And I'm not responsible
[1:22:15] for results. He is. I'm just his his
[1:22:18] helper in doing that. Oh, that God would
[1:22:22] give all of us that same that same
[1:22:25] assurance that we're going to be okay.
[1:22:28] We're going to make it. The Bible says,
[1:22:30] "You are of God, little children, and
[1:22:32] have overcome them because greater is
[1:22:35] he." Someone say, "Greater." Greater
[1:22:36] that is in you. Who is that? the
[1:22:38] quickening power, the quickening life
[1:22:40] that was in Christ. Greater is he that
[1:22:43] is in you than he that is in the
[1:22:47] world. I'm going to skip past some of
[1:22:49] this. Brother Robert, as we're going
[1:22:52] down, Brother Brandham talked about how
[1:22:54] the church was represented in Elijah and
[1:22:56] Elisha and how that one was Mrs. Mr.
[1:23:01] Jesus and one was Mrs. Jesus, if you
[1:23:03] could put it that way, in a tight. But I
[1:23:06] think sometimes we realize then that
[1:23:09] that quickening power was in them. If
[1:23:12] we're a type of that, it's in
[1:23:14] us. But again, I think all of us
[1:23:18] Christians included, if we just real
[1:23:20] honest, would probably kind of wonder,
[1:23:22] if I have that kind of power, why do I
[1:23:25] struggle so much?
[1:23:29] Come on. I know y'all are saints,
[1:23:32] but maybe some of you are angels. I
[1:23:34] haven't met any angels here yet, but
[1:23:36] there's probably some.
[1:23:40] But I know when I read that, Brother
[1:23:41] West, I think, why do I struggle so
[1:23:43] much?
[1:23:46] Why do I have a hard time sleeping
[1:23:48] sometimes? Why Why do I let stress get
[1:23:50] to me? Why do I do those things?
[1:23:53] If the quickening power is in my body,
[1:23:55] why do I have to repent?
[1:23:58] Well, think about it. I do. All of us
[1:24:01] do.
[1:24:03] He's the only one who did no sin. Why do
[1:24:06] I struggle with with things that, you
[1:24:08] know, I have to keep down? As Paul says,
[1:24:10] I keep under my body and bring it under
[1:24:12] subjection. Why do I need prayer? You
[1:24:15] know, I think people want to be tough.
[1:24:18] So, they don't want to come to the altar
[1:24:19] because they want to Everybody think,
[1:24:20] well, there's a good Christian. You
[1:24:22] know, they haven't been to the altar in
[1:24:23] years. Well, that's the one we kind of
[1:24:24] worry about.
[1:24:29] Are you with me now? say, "Well, if I
[1:24:31] go, they'll think I'm a sinner." No.
[1:24:33] Christians sometimes need help. We need
[1:24:36] prayer.
[1:24:38] Cuz the quickening power is in us, but
[1:24:41] but these bodies are bodies of
[1:24:43] humiliation.
[1:24:45] And they will humiliate us and do
[1:24:47] humiliate us from time to time. So, we
[1:24:50] find ourselves at the altar again. And I
[1:24:52] find myself, and I've told you before,
[1:24:54] that every time I come out that door,
[1:24:56] when I come out to pray, I stop there
[1:24:58] and pray for just a moment because I
[1:25:00] know that in my own in just my own ways
[1:25:02] and just my way of living and things
[1:25:04] that I try to be a good Christian and
[1:25:06] live a holy life, but I know that I I
[1:25:08] can mess up and sometimes maybe even do
[1:25:10] things I don't even think about and
[1:25:12] maybe say something to somebody that
[1:25:13] they would take wrong. And I don't want
[1:25:15] to do that. I don't want any anything in
[1:25:17] my life that would keep me from the
[1:25:19] power of God flowing through me. So
[1:25:21] every time I come out here, I repent. I
[1:25:23] have my own little altra there and I
[1:25:24] repent before God. Oh, I if we'd come to
[1:25:26] the house of God like that and say,
[1:25:28] "Lord, I just want to be clean today. I
[1:25:30] just want to be right. Lord, if there's
[1:25:32] anything wrong with me, take it out. I
[1:25:34] want to be right." I believe God would
[1:25:35] begin to move. You begin to see a
[1:25:37] revival among us. You begin to see the s
[1:25:39] uh sinners come in and you begin to see
[1:25:41] the sick healed. Why? Because God does
[1:25:44] what he says. If there's a repentant
[1:25:46] heart, he honors that. He will not
[1:25:48] refuse a broken and a contrite heart.
[1:25:50] Listen, he will not refuse it. That's a
[1:25:52] promise of God.
[1:25:59] Why do I get sick? Why do I need prayer?
[1:26:00] Well, Elisha might have been if them
[1:26:03] bones could
[1:26:04] think. You might have laid there and
[1:26:06] thought, "Why have I not raised?"
[1:26:12] Do you ever think about that? that the
[1:26:14] the guy is in the grave still doing
[1:26:17] miracles,
[1:26:20] but he's still in the grave, right? He's
[1:26:22] still that body is still there, right?
[1:26:25] Yeah. He's in paradise or whatever that
[1:26:27] Elisha was doing, but he's sitting there
[1:26:28] thinking, "My goodness, about time to
[1:26:30] come back." You know, other people are
[1:26:32] getting healed. And
[1:26:35] I see other people getting blessed. They
[1:26:38] they threw a man on my bones and he came
[1:26:40] back. I pray for the sick and they got
[1:26:43] well.
[1:26:45] Are you with me now? Why doesn't that
[1:26:48] quickening
[1:26:49] power do in my own life so many times
[1:26:52] what I want it to do? Just take me home.
[1:26:54] Let me be in heaven. You know,
[1:26:57] the truth is that same quickening power
[1:27:00] that was in Elisha raised him from the
[1:27:02] dead.
[1:27:04] Go to Matthew chapter 27 and verse 52.
[1:27:09] But what happened was the the graves,
[1:27:11] the the body was held by the word of God
[1:27:16] until the appointed
[1:27:18] time that it would come out. We know
[1:27:20] that paradise was emptied in Matthew
[1:27:22] 27:52. The graves were open and many
[1:27:25] bodies of the saints which slept
[1:27:30] arose. I don't know if this how it
[1:27:32] happened, but it just kind of comes to
[1:27:33] my mind, you know, dramatize it. Maybe
[1:27:35] he'd wake up some of these kids
[1:27:38] and he's like, you know, them bones are
[1:27:41] just there and they're they're there
[1:27:42] they're there not much left by this
[1:27:44] time, hundreds of years later. Very
[1:27:48] little left to Elisha.
[1:27:51] But
[1:27:51] every little molecule of Elisha was
[1:27:54] somewhere
[1:27:57] and it started to come back.
[1:27:59] Yeah.
[1:28:01] Again, I'm not teaching this for
[1:28:02] doctrine, just dramatizing. But can you
[1:28:04] imagine? Can you imagine them bones just
[1:28:05] start coming together, right? And at
[1:28:08] some point, Elisha wakes up and he said,
[1:28:11] "Oh, I'm back in my body."
[1:28:13] Praise God.
[1:28:16] Go down to Jerusalem and see what's up.
[1:28:19] Right? Because the Bible says they went
[1:28:21] down into the city and appeared to many.
[1:28:23] How would you feel if a dead man showed
[1:28:24] up and started talking to you? Right.
[1:28:29] Maddy's having none of it.
[1:28:34] But what was it? It was a resurrection.
[1:28:36] Oh, church, hear me this morning. We're
[1:28:38] promised that same thing one day. One of
[1:28:41] these mornings, it'll be maybe just like
[1:28:43] any other morning. But there will come a
[1:28:44] time. Oh, church. When when our dead
[1:28:47] relatives and and saints, the saints
[1:28:49] that have went on, our loved ones have
[1:28:51] went on in by the way of the grave. And
[1:28:53] those that believed in Christ, they'll
[1:28:55] raise on that day and they'll come to
[1:28:57] talk to us just like they did there. And
[1:29:00] you'll sit there having a conversation
[1:29:02] with somebody that died 20, 30 years
[1:29:04] ago. And you'll wake up suddenly. What?
[1:29:06] What is this? And brother said, suddenly
[1:29:08] a sweep will go over you. What's this
[1:29:10] sudden change? And you look down and
[1:29:11] your body's been changed. You're one of
[1:29:13] them. Hallelujah. You'll be gathered
[1:29:15] with them. The Bible says in the air to
[1:29:18] meet the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:20] Hallelujah. But the Bible says the
[1:29:22] graves were open and many bodies of the
[1:29:24] saints which slept arose and come out of
[1:29:26] the graves after his resurrection and
[1:29:27] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:29:30] unto
[1:29:32] many. Hallelujah. Now, it just wasn't
[1:29:36] time yet. Elisha didn't know when that
[1:29:39] would be. But until that day, the
[1:29:42] quickening power hovered over those
[1:29:45] bones. Let me tell you, you're living in
[1:29:46] a body of humiliation. You're living in
[1:29:48] a body of death. But until the day that
[1:29:51] your change comes, he's that quickening
[1:29:53] power is still there.
[1:29:56] Yes. It doesn't leave you. If you've
[1:29:58] been born again, he's actually within
[1:30:00] you. Now look, Brother Brandham says,
[1:30:04] "Now, let me show you. I don't care if
[1:30:05] you're dead or where you're at. That
[1:30:07] quickening power never leaves." Years
[1:30:10] and years after his death, his meat had
[1:30:11] rotted away. The skin worms had eated
[1:30:13] up. They were packing a dead man one
[1:30:15] day, throwed him in on that bones. There
[1:30:17] was so much quickening power there till
[1:30:19] the man come back to life again, raised
[1:30:21] him up from the dead because that
[1:30:22] quickening power was upon that saint of
[1:30:23] God. Never left him. Stay right on those
[1:30:25] bones. And remember, we are flesh of his
[1:30:27] flesh, bone of his bone if we are his
[1:30:30] bride.
[1:30:32] Death won't bother that quickening power
[1:30:34] at all. Hallelujah. Though the skin
[1:30:37] worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh
[1:30:40] shall I see God.
[1:30:43] Hallelujah. We don't have to be scared
[1:30:45] of death. If I told you that story about
[1:30:46] my kids giving me a hard time because I
[1:30:48] thought I was having a heart attack cuz
[1:30:50] I walked up a lighthouse and I'm just
[1:30:52] not made to do that. And I told y'all
[1:30:54] that story, but they were giving me a
[1:30:55] hard time about it. But the thing is,
[1:30:56] they were right. If if I die, I'm going
[1:30:59] to live again. It's going to be okay. If
[1:31:02] I go by way of the grave, I'm going to
[1:31:03] see them. Hallelujah. I'm going to be
[1:31:06] with them again. Why? Because I believe
[1:31:08] my children are are have been given to
[1:31:10] me. That they've been saved by the blood
[1:31:11] of the lamb. I believe that God has
[1:31:14] given me my house. And so I'm going to
[1:31:15] see him again. I don't have nothing to
[1:31:17] fear.
[1:31:19] Paul says, "Oh death, where is your
[1:31:21] sting? Oh grave, where is your victory?
[1:31:23] You do not have any victory anymore
[1:31:25] because sin has been defeated by the
[1:31:27] death of Christ on the cross." Now
[1:31:30] listen what brother Brandon says about
[1:31:31] Elisha. He said, "Remember that dead
[1:31:33] man, that prophet full of that
[1:31:34] quickening power laying in the grave and
[1:31:35] rotted away. There was so much
[1:31:37] quickening power till they throw a dead
[1:31:38] man on him and come to life." He said,
[1:31:40] "He could still lay hands on the sick,
[1:31:41] couldn't he?" Yes. Oo, there's something
[1:31:44] there, church.
[1:31:46] If the bones of
[1:31:48] Elisha before Calvary,
[1:31:53] hallelujah. If they could raise a dead
[1:31:55] man, what could these hands do? What
[1:31:58] could your hands do? If you could
[1:32:00] believe, right?
[1:32:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brander says,
[1:32:06] he said, "Easter means more than just a
[1:32:08] tradition. It's also now for our bodies
[1:32:11] are quickened with him and we're sitting
[1:32:13] in heavenly places. And this body may
[1:32:15] rot in the sea. It may rot in the
[1:32:17] ground. There may not be a spoonful of
[1:32:19] ashes,
[1:32:20] but she is coming forth.
[1:32:23] You might get cremated and your family
[1:32:25] might lose your ashes.
[1:32:29] They might get spilled over. One time we
[1:32:31] we had an auction growing up and
[1:32:33] somebody left their mama's ashes in an
[1:32:37] old bureau or dresser drawer or
[1:32:38] something. and we ended up with them. No
[1:32:40] name on. We didn't have a clue who it
[1:32:42] was, but it's somebody's ashes.
[1:32:45] Can you believe somebody would do that?
[1:32:47] They might forget about you. It might be
[1:32:49] scattered all over the place, but Sister
[1:32:50] Betty, well, you're coming back. Amen.
[1:32:52] It God knows where they are and he's
[1:32:55] going to bring you back again.
[1:32:57] Hallelujah. You say, "Brother Ben,
[1:32:58] explain that. I don't know exactly how
[1:33:00] it's going to happen. I don't know
[1:33:01] exactly how it's going to be, but Paul
[1:33:03] said, I know this." He said, "We'll have
[1:33:04] a body like his glorious body." Amen.
[1:33:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, "This
[1:33:10] body may rot in the sea. It may rot in
[1:33:12] the ground. There may not be a spoonful
[1:33:13] of ashes, but she is coming forth for
[1:33:15] the spirit that raised up my Lord from
[1:33:17] the dead has quickened this mortal body.
[1:33:19] It's quickened your mortal body. And we
[1:33:22] are his beneficiaries of his
[1:33:23] resurrection." His policy of eternal
[1:33:25] life. He said, "No wonder." He said,
[1:33:27] "Fear not." He would know. For Paul
[1:33:29] said, "Death, where is your stained
[1:33:30] grave? Where is your victory? I'm full
[1:33:31] of quickening power." Thanks be to God
[1:33:33] who gives us the victory through our
[1:33:35] Lord Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. Quickening
[1:33:37] power. Listen what Paul says about in
[1:33:39] Ephesians chapter 1:13. In whom you also
[1:33:42] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:33:44] truth, the gospel of your salvation. In
[1:33:46] whom also after that you believe, you
[1:33:48] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:33:50] promise, which is the earnest of our
[1:33:52] inheritance. Listen, what's he telling
[1:33:55] you? God has made a down payment on you.
[1:33:59] I think we misunderstand the earnest.
[1:34:01] Come on. We think of the Holy Ghost as
[1:34:03] being an earnest that a payment that we
[1:34:05] made.
[1:34:09] It's not a down payment that I made. Oh,
[1:34:12] come on, church. But God purchased you.
[1:34:15] You didn't purchase the gospel. You
[1:34:17] didn't You weren't even looking for the
[1:34:18] message of the hour, but God found you.
[1:34:22] Hallelujah. It's not a It's not a money
[1:34:24] that you gave as a as a purchase price,
[1:34:26] but it's something that he gave.
[1:34:29] Hallelujah. and his credit's a lot
[1:34:31] better than mine. His His worth is a
[1:34:34] whole lot more than mine. He will not
[1:34:36] lose one. Are you with me this morning,
[1:34:38] church? He will not lose one individual.
[1:34:44] We have the down payment. We have the
[1:34:45] the earnest. That's what the earnest
[1:34:47] means of our
[1:34:49] inheritance. For you have not received
[1:34:51] the spirit of bondage again to fear.
[1:34:53] Verse Romans 8:15. But you have received
[1:34:55] the spirit of what? Adoption.
[1:34:59] I've just got a few more minutes and
[1:35:00] we'll close. I know that ham's getting
[1:35:02] warm,
[1:35:04] but do do you have to eat ham on Easter?
[1:35:07] Is that a
[1:35:08] prerequisite? I
[1:35:10] guess I mean we got some bacon in there.
[1:35:13] We could put that with it. I guess my
[1:35:15] mind has turned towards the
[1:35:19] refrigerator. It does that from time to
[1:35:21] time. Brother
[1:35:24] Ga, I just had a vision. I saw that
[1:35:26] bacon sitting in our refrigerator. There
[1:35:28] got to be a way to pair that with the
[1:35:29] ham.
[1:35:32] Mom puts it in the green beans. So,
[1:35:34] praise
[1:35:36] God. If you're going to have something
[1:35:38] like green beans, healthy like that, you
[1:35:39] might as well add bacon to
[1:35:42] it. Are you with me this morning? Hope
[1:35:45] you're not wore out. Listen. He said,
[1:35:48] "We've received not the spirit of
[1:35:50] bondage, not the spirit of slavery, but
[1:35:53] the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[1:35:56] Abba, Father. The spirit also itself
[1:36:00] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:36:02] are the children of God. And if
[1:36:05] children, then heirs, heirs of God and
[1:36:06] joint hes with Christ, if so be that we
[1:36:08] suffer with him, that we may be also
[1:36:10] glorified together. For I reckon, I like
[1:36:13] that. I reckon that the sufferings of
[1:36:16] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:36:18] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:36:20] revealed in us. For the earnest
[1:36:22] expectation of the creature
[1:36:24] waiteth just like Elisha waited for a
[1:36:27] resurrection. The earnest expectation of
[1:36:29] the creation waitth for the
[1:36:31] manifestation of the sons of God. You
[1:36:33] realize the whole earth is waiting on us
[1:36:36] because the earth is going to be
[1:36:37] renewed. The earth was purchased by his
[1:36:39] blood. When those drops of blood fell on
[1:36:41] the earth, the earth was purchased by
[1:36:42] his blood. But it's waiting on us so it
[1:36:45] can be washed and filled with his
[1:36:47] presence. Amen. Listen. The earnest
[1:36:51] expectation of the creature waitth for
[1:36:52] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:36:53] For the creature was made subject to
[1:36:55] vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
[1:36:57] him who has subjected the same in hope.
[1:36:59] Because the creature itself also shall
[1:37:01] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:37:03] corruption. So he's saying, not just the
[1:37:04] soul, but the body itself. Come on,
[1:37:07] church. Where is the quickening power?
[1:37:08] In the body, brother JT. this mortal
[1:37:11] body, this body of humiliation, this
[1:37:14] body of death will be raised. It'll be
[1:37:17] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:37:19] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:37:21] children of God. For we know the whole
[1:37:23] creation groanth and travaleth in pain
[1:37:25] together until now. Not only they, but
[1:37:27] ourselves also, which have the first
[1:37:29] fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves
[1:37:31] grown within ourselves or something.
[1:37:33] We're not happy. We're not satisfied
[1:37:34] with where we're at. We're looking for
[1:37:36] something more. These bodies are not the
[1:37:38] end. Listen to me, young people. This
[1:37:40] life is not all there is. There's a
[1:37:42] better life somewhere. There's another
[1:37:44] life. This is the smallest portion of
[1:37:45] your life. Amen.
[1:37:49] And so we wait for the
[1:37:52] adoption, the redemption of our body.
[1:37:57] Becky went, my sister Becky has two
[1:38:00] adopted children, and I uh remember we
[1:38:03] went to Miles's adoption, didn't we,
[1:38:05] Miles? Big grin come over Miles's face
[1:38:07] when I said that. He uh he's a special
[1:38:10] boy. And we uh we went to Fort where was
[1:38:14] that? Fort Smith to his adoption. We all
[1:38:18] sat there and they did something. You
[1:38:20] know, they made us wear
[1:38:21] t-shirts and I'm not much of a a
[1:38:24] matching t-shirt wearer. You
[1:38:27] know, I don't think I've ever worn it
[1:38:30] since, but it's in my still in my
[1:38:31] closet. I saw it the other day and I
[1:38:34] think it said Did it say gotcha on it or
[1:38:36] something like that? Gotcha.
[1:38:38] And so every year they celebrate a
[1:38:40] birthday and a gotcha day. Amen. Right.
[1:38:43] Adoption day. Amen. Because there was a
[1:38:46] day
[1:38:49] he was living at home. He was he'd been
[1:38:51] he'd been loved by her and taken into
[1:38:53] her home. But there come a day he'd
[1:38:54] become adopted into the family.
[1:38:57] [Applause]
[1:38:58] Listen to me, church. Our souls have
[1:39:00] been adopted into the family, but we're
[1:39:02] waiting on the body. Hallelujah. One of
[1:39:04] these days, I don't know if we'll wear
[1:39:06] t-shirts, but one of these days, there
[1:39:08] will be a gathering in the judge.
[1:39:09] Hallelujah. The judge of all the earth
[1:39:11] say it's time to come home.
[1:39:15] And when he does, that'll be our gotcha
[1:39:16] day. Hallelujah. There's coming a day
[1:39:19] when every one of us will be will be
[1:39:21] grabbed up,
[1:39:22] claimed. Some family had to claim had to
[1:39:25] claim those children. A family had to
[1:39:27] claim them and bring them in and love
[1:39:28] them. And we were claimed by God
[1:39:30] himself. That's my gift. That's my
[1:39:32] family. We were flesh of his flesh, bone
[1:39:34] of his bones. We just didn't know it.
[1:39:36] But we got a gotcha day. Amen.
[1:39:39] Hallelujah. You were always his, but you
[1:39:41] didn't know it. But one day, he got you.
[1:39:44] Amen. I know it's not good English, but
[1:39:46] it's something we ought to we ought to
[1:39:47] be excited about today.
[1:39:50] Hallelujah.
[1:39:51] See, we must wait for our bodies to be
[1:39:54] changed, but we do not have to wait for
[1:39:57] our bodies to become subject to the
[1:39:58] word. Now, hear this before we close.
[1:40:02] When the body receives the spirit of
[1:40:04] God, the immortal life inside of you, it
[1:40:06] throws this body in subjection to
[1:40:10] God. Still a body of sin, but it's under
[1:40:13] subjection. He that's born of God does
[1:40:16] not commit sin. He cannot sin. See, a
[1:40:18] person that's born of God, if he if he
[1:40:20] does something wrong, he repents of it.
[1:40:22] The blood protects him. That's right.
[1:40:24] Right. He has an atonement. He said it's
[1:40:27] there's a there's an advocate. You have
[1:40:29] an advocate with the father, the Lord
[1:40:31] Jesus Christ. See, he said that throws
[1:40:34] your body subject. You don't have to
[1:40:37] say, "Oh, if I could just quit drinking,
[1:40:40] right? Just get in Christ and it's all
[1:40:43] gone." That's right. Amen. I wish people
[1:40:45] could see that. Amen.
[1:40:48] We got testimonies of that. Many of the
[1:40:50] folks sitting here were delivered from
[1:40:51] alcohol, delivered from cigarettes,
[1:40:53] delivered from drugs. Amen.
[1:40:56] Oh, if I could just quit. He said, "Just
[1:40:58] get in Christ. It's all gone because
[1:41:01] your body is subject to the spirit. It's
[1:41:03] no more subject to the things of the
[1:41:05] world. They're dead. Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:06] They are dead. Your sins are buried in
[1:41:08] baptism and you are a new creation in
[1:41:11] Christ in your body, becoming subject to
[1:41:13] the spirit to live the right kind of
[1:41:15] life." He said, "You women came, you got
[1:41:17] the Holy Ghost going on wearing shorts
[1:41:19] and things. How could you do it? How
[1:41:20] could the spirit of God and you ever let
[1:41:22] you do such a thing as that? It just
[1:41:23] can't be." He said, "It can't be. It's
[1:41:25] not a He's not a filthy spirit. He's a
[1:41:26] Holy Spirit." But what does it make you
[1:41:28] subject to, church? It makes you subject
[1:41:29] to the word. So whatever God said in his
[1:41:32] word, no matter what the world says, no
[1:41:33] matter what they're doing, no matter how
[1:41:35] they're dressing, no matter how they're
[1:41:36] living, no matter what they're go,
[1:41:37] what's going on with them in their
[1:41:39] marriages and in their homes, we've got
[1:41:40] a word to live by. We got a word. It's
[1:41:44] not a forced thing. It's not that the
[1:41:46] pastor tells you to do it. Listen, if
[1:41:47] it's a set of rules, it'll always be a
[1:41:49] set of rules that'll keep you under
[1:41:50] bondage. But when the life comes on the
[1:41:52] inside, things will change. We won't
[1:41:54] have to make you do it. There'll be
[1:41:56] something you want you to do it with all
[1:41:57] your heart.
[1:42:00] He said then when you become subject to
[1:42:02] that spirit, it throws your whole being
[1:42:03] subject to that spirit and that spirit
[1:42:05] is nothing in the world but this seed
[1:42:07] word made manifest quickened made alive.
[1:42:09] When the Bible said don't do this, that
[1:42:11] body quickly turns to it. There is no
[1:42:13] question. So the problem is either
[1:42:16] people have not been quickened to the
[1:42:18] word or they haven't heard it. I'm going
[1:42:21] to take care of one problem this
[1:42:22] morning. This morning you say, "I heard
[1:42:23] it. Amen. Now it's time to be quickened.
[1:42:29] You see, we don't have a contract. He
[1:42:31] didn't give us a contract with
[1:42:34] conditions. Listen what he says. It's
[1:42:35] the earnest of the inherit of the
[1:42:37] resurrection. This body will be raised
[1:42:39] up again because it's already started.
[1:42:42] Oh, that's more powerful than we even
[1:42:43] know. Brother Stewart, I wish I could
[1:42:46] preach. Man, this body, hallelujah, will
[1:42:50] be raised up again because it's already
[1:42:52] started. It was once subject to sin and
[1:42:54] mire and corruption, but now it's got
[1:42:56] the earnest. It's turned heavenly. He
[1:42:58] said, "No, that's the earnest that
[1:42:59] you're going in the rapture." You said,
[1:43:01] "Well, I know I have the Holy Ghost, but
[1:43:03] I'm worried about going in the rapture."
[1:43:04] If you have the Holy Ghost, he will not
[1:43:06] leave you here. That same spirit that
[1:43:09] raised your mortal, his mortal body will
[1:43:11] also raise your mortal body. The same
[1:43:14] spirit that quickened him will quicken
[1:43:15] you.
[1:43:18] But we don't have a contract with
[1:43:20] conditions. I know, brother Joe and them
[1:43:22] tried to sell their house and it was a
[1:43:23] contract but had conditions, right?
[1:43:26] Conditions. We have contracts with
[1:43:29] conditions. I've seen that many times. I
[1:43:30] was in land title for many years and and
[1:43:32] I don't know how many closings got
[1:43:33] stopped because of some condition in the
[1:43:35] contract and sometimes it was a few
[1:43:37] dollars. You know, they wanted just
[1:43:39] something a little extra done and they
[1:43:40] wouldn't do it or somebody forgot they
[1:43:42] had to pay for insurance and they just
[1:43:45] didn't have the money. Oh my. But his
[1:43:49] down payment that he made on you was not
[1:43:51] subject to conditions.
[1:43:53] He never told Abraham, "If if you'll do
[1:43:56] this, I'll do this." But he said, "I'll
[1:43:58] make of you a great nation." Hallelujah.
[1:44:01] I'm going to give you a son regardless
[1:44:03] of what you do. I'm going to do it.
[1:44:04] Because he knew Abraham would believe
[1:44:06] him. Abraham would follow him. And he
[1:44:08] wouldn't have put a down payment in you
[1:44:09] if he didn't know you would follow him.
[1:44:12] So we don't worry about it. That so many
[1:44:14] times new Christians are defeated. Are
[1:44:18] you still with me this morning? I'm
[1:44:19] almost done. New new Christians are
[1:44:21] defeated by worry and fear.
[1:44:24] Because the first thing they do, they
[1:44:25] get saved, they come to the Lord, they
[1:44:27] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and
[1:44:28] then the devil starts working on them.
[1:44:30] Say, "Well, you know, you'd walk better.
[1:44:33] You'd do this better. You do that better
[1:44:34] if you were a real Christian." That's
[1:44:36] right. Babies aren't born full grown.
[1:44:39] But he that begun a good work in you
[1:44:42] will finish that work. How many believe
[1:44:43] that today? He'll help you walk. He'll
[1:44:46] help you along. He'll teach you the way.
[1:44:50] So many of our young people get
[1:44:51] discouraged because they're not just
[1:44:52] where they ought to be. But your
[1:44:54] heavenly father loves you. That's right.
[1:44:56] He watches every step that you make.
[1:44:58] He's not He's He's not going to cast you
[1:45:00] out. You're still his son. You're still
[1:45:02] his daughter. Even though you might make
[1:45:05] a mistake.
[1:45:07] Is a contract with no conditions. You're
[1:45:09] sealed to the day of your redemption.
[1:45:11] And that power enables you to fulfill
[1:45:14] the great commission of Mark 16:17. He
[1:45:16] said, "These sons shall follow them that
[1:45:19] believe." You know, I know people will
[1:45:21] say today, I had a a Bible, I had a
[1:45:24] commentary and said, "Well, them that
[1:45:25] believe is the disciples." Well, that's
[1:45:26] not what it says. It says them.
[1:45:30] I'm just simple enough to put my name in
[1:45:33] there. Lord, I believe. These sons shall
[1:45:36] follow them that believe. In my name
[1:45:39] shall they cast out devils. They shall
[1:45:42] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[1:45:44] up serpents. And if they drink any
[1:45:45] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[1:45:47] You don't go looking for snakes to pick
[1:45:49] up. But if you happen to pick one up, if
[1:45:51] you had the faith that in the word of
[1:45:53] God, you could say, "I'm in the line of
[1:45:54] duty. This can't stop me." No more than
[1:45:57] it could stop Paul from going to Rome.
[1:45:59] We don't go out and look for poison and
[1:46:01] drink it. You don't stand in front of a
[1:46:03] train, let it run you over. But what do
[1:46:05] we do? We believe God's able. If we find
[1:46:07] ourselves in a difficult situation, he's
[1:46:09] able to get us out. How many could
[1:46:10] testify of that this morning? He's
[1:46:12] brought me out of so many things. He's
[1:46:14] kept me from so many things. Amen.
[1:46:20] And he said they'll take up serpents and
[1:46:21] if they drink any deadly thing and won't
[1:46:22] harm them, they shall lay hands on the
[1:46:24] sick and they
[1:46:25] shall
[1:46:27] recover. That's Elisha sending his
[1:46:30] staff. Then he went and laid his hands,
[1:46:32] his whole body on the baby,
[1:46:35] right? Paul sent out handkerchiefs and
[1:46:38] aprons. We know that's a valid way to be
[1:46:40] healed if people have their have enough
[1:46:41] faith to believe that. But many times
[1:46:43] you have to have hands laid on you. But
[1:46:45] remember, those aren't just
[1:46:49] hands. Laying hands on the sick will
[1:46:52] never
[1:46:53] cease. When the disciples received the
[1:46:55] quickening power on the day of
[1:46:56] Pentecost, what did they do? They went
[1:46:57] out and laid hands on the sick and they
[1:46:59] recovered. That's the quickening power
[1:47:01] like was on Elisha's bones. The same
[1:47:03] quickening power is upon the saints that
[1:47:05] raised them up. If that same quickening
[1:47:07] power is in us, lay your hands on the
[1:47:10] sick and they shall recover. Now, while
[1:47:13] we're seated here this morning, as we're
[1:47:16] closing, I I know we did this last week,
[1:47:19] but I think maybe with an understanding
[1:47:22] of the quickening power in these
[1:47:24] bones. See, we want to put that on
[1:47:27] Elisha, but what about these bones?
[1:47:30] What about these hands?
[1:47:32] I want you to lay hands on one another
[1:47:34] and I'm just going to tell you a little
[1:47:35] bit about the quickening power in your
[1:47:38] body while you do that. So just lay
[1:47:40] hands on somebody besides you, husband
[1:47:42] to wife, brother to sister, lay your
[1:47:45] hands on them. He said they shall lay
[1:47:46] hands on the sick. I know we got sick
[1:47:48] people among us, but I just want to
[1:47:51] demonstrate the word of God to you.
[1:47:54] There's something powerful about the
[1:47:56] connection of laying on of hands.
[1:47:59] Your hands on the people has got
[1:48:01] quickening power in them if you've been
[1:48:04] quickened. So I want to ask you while
[1:48:06] you got your hands laid on your your
[1:48:07] neighbor, your friend, your husband,
[1:48:09] your wife. Has Christ become real to
[1:48:11] you? Has the power of God been
[1:48:14] manifested? Are you in that church?
[1:48:17] Amen. God has provided church. How are
[1:48:19] you in it? How do you know you've been
[1:48:20] quickened in it? Your whole thoughts,
[1:48:22] your whole being is in Christ. And
[1:48:23] Christ is in the midst of the people
[1:48:25] proving himself alive, proving he's here
[1:48:27] at the days of Sodom with hands on
[1:48:30] people that whose lives have been
[1:48:31] changed from street walkers, from
[1:48:33] drunkards, from prostitutes to genuine
[1:48:35] saints of God quickened. Their hands is
[1:48:37] laying on you. They're in the church by
[1:48:39] Holy Ghost baptism. The same power that
[1:48:42] was upon Elijah's bones, that same power
[1:48:44] is laying upon your shoulder, upon your
[1:48:46] head. That same quickening power. Can
[1:48:49] you believe that now? Do you believe
[1:48:50] you're in his church? than if you are.
[1:48:52] He said, "I command you in the name of
[1:48:54] Jesus Christ to stand to your feet and
[1:48:56] accept your
[1:48:59] healing." He thought he was going to
[1:49:00] pray. He didn't say if you prayed. He
[1:49:02] said, "If you lay hands on the sick,
[1:49:03] they shall recover." We'll have prayer
[1:49:05] in a moment. But if you believe that
[1:49:07] quickening power is sitting next to you,
[1:49:08] why don't you stand up and accept your
[1:49:10] healing? Believe that God believe that
[1:49:12] God's able to do it. Do you believe it,
[1:49:14] church? Those hands that laid on you,
[1:49:16] you say, "Well, I don't know about them,
[1:49:18] but there's quickening power in you.
[1:49:19] There's quickening power in the pew next
[1:49:21] to you. If you can believe that, you can
[1:49:24] have everything that everything that you
[1:49:26] need this morning. I don't know what you
[1:49:28] come in with. I don't know what need you
[1:49:29] come in with, but you can have it this
[1:49:31] morning if you can believe it. Do you
[1:49:33] believe you're in his church? Then then
[1:49:35] he said, "I command you to stand your
[1:49:37] feet and accept your healing if you've
[1:49:39] been sick." Oh, do you accept it this
[1:49:42] morning? Listen, we don't need a bunch
[1:49:43] of music. I I thank God for our music,
[1:49:45] but we don't need a bunch of that to
[1:49:46] praise God. We ought ought to be a
[1:49:48] worship in our hearts. Lord, I believe.
[1:49:50] I believe you're the same yesterday,
[1:49:52] today, and forever. I believe you're
[1:49:54] here this morning. You didn't die when a
[1:49:55] prophet died in 1965. You didn't die
[1:49:58] there on the cross. You died, but you
[1:50:00] come back to life. You didn't stay dead.
[1:50:02] I'm so grateful for that, Lord. I'm so
[1:50:04] thankful.
[1:50:06] Hallelujah. I want you to bow your heads
[1:50:08] with
[1:50:09] me.
[1:50:11] Hallelujah. Maybe there's someone here,
[1:50:14] a
[1:50:15] sinner, with every head bowed and every
[1:50:17] eye closed.
[1:50:20] would like to come into that
[1:50:21] body. Say, I'd like to receive that. You
[1:50:25] can be baptized. And that's important.
[1:50:28] He said, if you're baptized in the name
[1:50:30] of Jesus Christ, you shall receive the
[1:50:31] gift of the Holy Ghost. And yet at the
[1:50:34] same time, in Cornelius's house, they
[1:50:35] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:37] While they heard the word, they received
[1:50:40] it and then they went and got
[1:50:41] baptized. So, we believe you can receive
[1:50:44] it this morning right where you're
[1:50:46] at. Is there sinners here that would
[1:50:48] like to come into that body? Raise your
[1:50:50] hands and say, "I've never been filled
[1:50:53] with the Holy Ghost, but I certainly
[1:50:54] desire it
[1:50:55] today." If every head bowed, God bless
[1:50:58] those hands at hand. I need that baptism
[1:51:01] of the Holy Ghost in my
[1:51:03] life. Maybe some of you elders been
[1:51:05] around a long time, but you need a
[1:51:06] refilling of the Holy Ghost. I see a
[1:51:08] bunch more hands going. My hands are up.
[1:51:10] I need him. I need him to come. I I need
[1:51:14] his presence. Let this Easter be a
[1:51:16] resurrection day for my life where my
[1:51:18] body becomes subject to the word
[1:51:21] again. Oh granted,
[1:51:23] Lord, heavenly father, Lord, as we
[1:51:26] approach you now through prayer, we've
[1:51:30] already laid hands on one another. We
[1:51:31] believed, Lord, for our healing, Lord,
[1:51:34] and now we believe for salvation, for
[1:51:36] the Holy Ghost, for every person, Lord,
[1:51:38] within the sound of our voice, Lord. May
[1:51:40] it be like an upper room experience,
[1:51:42] Lord, on Acts two where they were all
[1:51:44] filled with the Holy Ghost. And then we
[1:51:46] find in Acts 4 that they were all
[1:51:48] refilled with the Holy Ghost. May it be
[1:51:50] so this morning. May the walls be moved
[1:51:52] by your presence. May we accept you with
[1:51:54] all for all that you are. Lord, if
[1:51:56] there's someone struggling with Lord,
[1:51:58] maybe not making themselves subject to
[1:52:00] all of the word. I pray God you'd take
[1:52:02] that take that struggle away this
[1:52:04] morning. Help them to understand that if
[1:52:06] they can surrender to you that that
[1:52:08] power can come in them to help them to
[1:52:09] live a victorious life. It won't be some
[1:52:12] kind of a do or a don't or a list of of
[1:52:14] things to do or a list of things not to
[1:52:16] do, but God, it'll be a spirit living
[1:52:18] out in them. Something that'll keep them
[1:52:20] from the things of the world. I pray
[1:52:21] you'd grant it, Lord. I pray you'd heal
[1:52:23] the sick, Lord, as we've already
[1:52:24] believed for it. I pray you'd move,
[1:52:26] Lord, in a mighty way. Bring revival
[1:52:28] among us, oh God, as we come to this
[1:52:30] Easter season, Lord. May it be a change.
[1:52:33] And I've seen so many times you've
[1:52:35] changed before. You've changed
[1:52:36] individuals. Lord, may it be a change to
[1:52:39] us as a church goal. God, give us more
[1:52:41] of your love. Give us more of your
[1:52:43] power. Oh, God. Give us revival in our
[1:52:45] souls. Lord, we need you today. We love
[1:52:48] you. We thank you for being here with
[1:52:50] us. I pray that you'd grant it, Lord.
[1:52:52] Pray that you'd move in a mighty way as
[1:52:55] only you can do. May your anointing, may
[1:52:58] your quickening power flow through these
[1:52:59] hands or that are raised in worship,
[1:53:02] Lord. And may they believe you with all
[1:53:03] of their hearts. Pray you grant it now
[1:53:06] in Jesus
[1:53:07] name.
[1:53:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you need to
[1:53:12] pray, the altar's open. If you need to
[1:53:14] be prayed for, I'd be glad to pray with
[1:53:16] you. We'll just linger for a moment, but
[1:53:17] let's just worship you with all of our
[1:53:19] heart. You are great. Oh, you do
[1:53:23] miracles so great. Well, I've seen them,
[1:53:26] Lord. I am one.
[1:53:30] Hallelujah. Oh, there is no one else
[1:53:35] like you. Oh, you are great. Oh, do you
[1:53:39] believe it this morning? He raised from
[1:53:41] the dead. As some we can all agree on on
[1:53:43] Easter Sunday morning. He's raised from
[1:53:45] the dead. He's worthy of my
[1:53:47] praise. Hallelujah.
[1:53:50] Oh, there is no one else like you. You
[1:53:57] deserve the glory. Oh, you deserve the
[1:54:00] glory. Oh, does he deserve it on this
[1:54:02] resurrection day? Let's just worship him
[1:54:05] now with all of our
[1:54:06] hearts. Oh Lord, we lift our hearts in
[1:54:11] worship as we lift your holy name. Oh,
[1:54:16] you deserve the glory.
[1:54:19] Oh, thank you Lord and the
[1:54:25] honor. Lord, we lift our hands in
[1:54:29] worship. Oh, as we praise your holy
[1:54:32] name. Oh, for you are great. Hallelujah.
[1:54:36] You do miracles so
[1:54:39] great. Oh, there is no one else like
[1:54:44] you. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, there is
[1:54:48] no one else like you. Oh, you are great.
[1:54:53] Oh, can you acknowledge he is great this
[1:54:55] morning? So great. There is no one
[1:55:00] else like
[1:55:03] you. Oh, there is
[1:55:07] no else like you. Sing hallelujah.
[1:55:11] Hallelujah. I think it's
[1:55:14] F. Amen. Just lift your hands to him.
[1:55:17] Close your eyes. Just worship him a
[1:55:19] minute.
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:22] Hallelujah. I'm singing
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:29] hallelujah. Oh, we thank you, Lord
[1:55:32] Jesus.
[1:55:36] Hallelujah. I thank you for an empty
[1:55:38] tomb, Lord. Thank you for a living
[1:55:42] Christ. Thank you for the miracle of the
[1:55:44] new birth. Thank you for love,
[1:55:47] Lord. Oh, I'm singing
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:54] hallelujah.
[1:55:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:06] Oh
[1:56:10] [Music]
[1:56:14] hallelujah. Oh hal
[1:56:18] hallelujah. Can we raise in one piece?
[1:56:20] Sing. Thank you
[1:56:23] Jesus. Thank
[1:56:25] you
[1:56:27] Jesus. Oh there it is. Lord you love him
[1:56:30] this morning.
[1:56:32] Thank you,
[1:56:36] Jesus. Lord, thank you for being here
[1:56:38] with us,
[1:56:39] Lord. Oh, thank you,
[1:56:45] Jesus.
[1:56:47] Oh, I
[1:56:49] thank Thank you,
[1:56:53] Jesus. Oh, yes. I thank you.
[1:57:02] Oh, I
[1:57:05] thank you
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:12] Jesus. Oh, thank you
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:19] Jesus. Oh, I
[1:57:21] thank you Jesus.
[1:57:27] Lord Jesus, I pray that you would bless
[1:57:30] this congregation,
[1:57:32] Lord. Lord, as they go about their their
[1:57:35] week and especially at this season,
[1:57:38] Lord, that we call
[1:57:40] Easter, recognizing it's more than a
[1:57:42] rabbit or or some eggs, but Lord,
[1:57:45] there's a there's a truth, Lord, that on
[1:57:48] this
[1:57:49] weekend, Lord, that you died for our
[1:57:52] sins. We thank you for
[1:57:54] that. that you didn't stay dead. You
[1:57:58] rose on the third day. And we honor that
[1:58:00] today. In fact, Lord, not just on Easter
[1:58:04] Sunday, but every Sunday. We gather the
[1:58:06] first day of the week as
[1:58:08] Christians because it's an honor of your
[1:58:11] resurrection. I pray that that would
[1:58:13] continue until the day you come. We
[1:58:17] thank you for our brothers and sisters.
[1:58:18] I pray you'd bless them in their work.
[1:58:21] Pray you'd bless them, Lord, as they go
[1:58:22] out in their in their family
[1:58:24] relationships, Lord.
[1:58:26] Maybe where there would be strife, let
[1:58:27] there be peace. Where there would be
[1:58:29] trouble, let there be joy, oh God. Maybe
[1:58:32] where there would be sickness, let there
[1:58:34] be healing,
[1:58:35] Lord. Maybe the devil's got a trap set
[1:58:38] for one of them out. They're on the
[1:58:39] roads, but Lord, we know you're able to
[1:58:41] reveal it to them. And Lord, guide them
[1:58:43] a different direction. I pray you grant
[1:58:46] it, Lord. We thank you for all that
[1:58:48] you've done. We love you, Lord. We just
[1:58:50] can't say enough about you. I worship
[1:58:53] you today. I pray you'd bless each one
[1:58:55] that sitting patiently, Lord, and heard
[1:58:58] the word this morning. May it go deeper
[1:58:59] than their heads. May it go down to
[1:59:01] their hearts. Lord, I I couldn't put it
[1:59:03] maybe the way I wanted to, but Lord, I I
[1:59:05] pray that you would take it and make it
[1:59:08] the way you want it, Lord. It sink in,
[1:59:10] oh God, into our hearts. Recognize,
[1:59:13] Lord, we can recognize the power that's
[1:59:15] in us. Pray for you. Grant it now. We
[1:59:18] thank you for it in Jesus name.
[1:59:20] Hallelujah. As brother Helen comes,
[1:59:22] we'll just worship for just a moment and
[1:59:24] you can be dismissed. God bless
[1:59:27] you. Thank
[1:59:29] you,
[1:59:35] Jesus. Thank you,
[1:59:44] Jesus. Amen.
[1:59:48] God is so
[1:59:54] good.
[1:59:56] God is so
[2:00:01] good. Yes,
[2:00:04] God is so
[2:00:08] good. He's so
[2:00:12] good
[2:00:14] to me. He answers
[2:00:17] prayer. Oh,
[2:00:20] he
[2:00:22] answers
[2:00:26] prayers.
[2:00:28] He
[2:00:30] answers
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:33] prayers. Yes,
[2:00:36] he
[2:00:38] answers prayers.
[2:00:41] See, he's so
[2:00:44] good. Just before we go, I love him
[2:00:47] so.
[2:00:49] Oh, and
[2:00:52] I love him so. If you love him, why
[2:00:56] don't you lift your hands to it?
[2:01:00] I love him
[2:01:05] so. Yes.
[2:01:08] I love him.
[2:01:12] So, he's so
[2:01:16] good
[2:01:17] to
[2:01:19] me. Can we give the Lord a hand clap of
[2:01:25] praise? Amen. You're free to go. We're
[2:01:28] going to sing this song, He Set Me Free.
[2:01:29] Just appreciate our visitors coming out
[2:01:31] and worshiping with us this morning.
[2:01:33] Just make sure you shake their hands on
[2:01:34] the way out. And remember, there's no
[2:01:36] service this evening. Come expecting
[2:01:38] Wednesday.
[2:01:39] Amen. Well, once like a bird in prison,
[2:01:45] I
[2:01:46] dwell. No freedom from my sorrow, I
[2:01:52] felt. Then Jesus came and he listened to
[2:01:57] me. Glory to God. He set me free.
[2:02:04] He set me free. Yes, he set me
[2:02:08] free. He broke the bonds of
[2:02:14] prison. I'm glory bound by Jesus to
[2:02:19] sing. Glory to God. He set me
[2:02:25] free. And now I am
[2:02:28] climbing higher each day.
[2:02:34] has drifted
[2:02:36] away. My feet are
[2:02:39] planted on higher
[2:02:42] ground. Glory to God. I'm over
