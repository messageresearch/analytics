[40:31] special need on your heart. Like to lift
[40:33] your hand to the Lord and say, "Lord, I
[40:35] need you this morning." Would you just
[40:37] do that? We know He knows every heart,
[40:39] knows every need. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[40:42] we see the upraised hands, Lord, in the
[40:44] sanctuary. We see, Lord, that Lord,
[40:47] you're an everpresent help in time of
[40:49] trouble, Lord. We all face trouble
[40:52] sometimes. But this morning, we're just
[40:54] asking you to take care of it, Lord. And
[40:56] whatever we have need of, God. If it's
[40:59] spiritual, financial, physical, whatever
[41:01] it is, God, we believe that you'll meet
[41:03] that need, I pray that you'd grant it
[41:05] this morning. I pray that your word
[41:08] would be clear today, Lord. That it
[41:10] would not be a uh Lord, just a a form of
[41:14] service, Lord. May there be a reality of
[41:17] your word to us. May it strike
[41:19] revelation in our hearts. Make us act
[41:21] different and live different, Lord, and
[41:23] worship you more. Pray you'd grant it
[41:26] now. Those that are sick, I pray that
[41:28] you'd meet that need. Pray you'd help me
[41:30] this morning. Pray you'd help the
[41:32] people. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[41:36] Amen. God bless you. Turn with me if you
[41:40] would to Psalm 63. Psalm 63 and1. Good
[41:44] to see you all out in the house of the
[41:45] Lord this morning. I uh uh my voice is
[41:49] bad just from the allergy season as I'm
[41:52] sure most of you deal with that as well.
[41:55] So, you just bear with me this morning.
[41:57] And uh we're going to have the baptism
[41:59] right after the service. So the way that
[42:01] we do that is we'll at the end of the
[42:04] service is we'll just go straight to the
[42:06] baptistry which is in the fellowship
[42:08] hall and uh that's part of our service.
[42:10] So if you could do that with us when
[42:12] we're done instead of fellowship in here
[42:14] we'll go straight to the service or to
[42:16] the baptism and then uh then we'll be
[42:19] dismissed. Psalms chapter 63 and verse
[42:22] one says, "Oh God, thou art my God.
[42:26] Early will I seek thee. My soul
[42:29] thirsteth for thee. My flesh longeth for
[42:33] thee in a dry and thirsty land where no
[42:37] water is to see thy power and thy glory.
[42:41] So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
[42:45] Pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[42:46] the word. You may be seated. I want to
[42:48] speak to you this morning on just a
[42:50] little bit of a different thought that's
[42:51] off of our uh series that we've been on.
[42:54] I want to speak to you this morning on
[42:56] how did the desert get dry? How did the
[43:01] desert get
[43:03] dry? I uh desert is classified as a
[43:06] region of land that receives very little
[43:10] precipitation, typically less than 10 in
[43:12] a year and is characterized by uh
[43:16] extreme temperatures and sparse
[43:18] vegetation and little rain. But we know
[43:21] that the deserts, the natural desert
[43:23] that we see today, it was not always
[43:26] dry. In fact, science says that the
[43:28] desert in Tucson is less than 10,000
[43:30] years old. I think we could probably pin
[43:32] it down even closer than that. I think
[43:35] it's probably about 4,000 years old
[43:37] because that would be after the flood.
[43:40] In Genesis chapter 2, we found out that
[43:43] God made uh the heavens and the earth.
[43:45] It says, "These are the generations of
[43:47] the heavens of the earth when they were
[43:50] created in the day that the Lord God
[43:52] made the earth and the heavens and every
[43:54] plant of the field before it was in the
[43:56] earth and every herb of the field before
[43:59] it grew. For the Lord God had not caused
[44:01] it to rain upon the earth. And there was
[44:04] not a man to till the ground, but there
[44:07] went up a mist from the earth and
[44:09] watered the whole face of the ground."
[44:11] We know that rain didn't come until
[44:13] Noah's time. In Genesis 7 and verse 11,
[44:17] it says, "In the 600th year of Noah's
[44:19] life in the second month, in the 17th
[44:21] day of the month, the same day were all
[44:23] the fountains of the great deep broken
[44:25] up and the windows of heaven were open."
[44:29] And so, the rain finally came down uh
[44:32] from the heavens. Now when the rain
[44:34] finally stopped and the water receded,
[44:37] we find that some land got more rain
[44:40] than others and and slowly the the grass
[44:43] begin to disappear and and the plants
[44:46] begin to change and uh as they got less
[44:49] and less rain and less and less water in
[44:52] in the ground that eventually it
[44:55] actually changed the character of the
[44:57] land. But we think about that and when
[45:00] you cross into a desert, you know you're
[45:02] in a desert, right? You you come into
[45:04] that kind of a sparse vegetation, you
[45:06] know, uh that that you've left the trees
[45:09] and you've left the pollen and praise
[45:11] the Lord, you you've left the I just
[45:14] feel like going to the desert right now.
[45:16] You've left all the things that cause
[45:17] allergies and you get out there into the
[45:19] desert where it's dry. But but it
[45:23] didn't, you know, that didn't happen
[45:25] overnight. Like it's not like we us
[45:27] crossing into it. If you had been in the
[45:30] desert and always been a part of it, say
[45:32] you were a plant or a flower in the
[45:34] desert, it just gradually gets less and
[45:37] less rain and adapts to the environment
[45:40] that it's in. That's why a person, if we
[45:42] take it to the spiritual side, when they
[45:44] begin to get out of church and they
[45:46] begin to get out from under the
[45:48] blessings of God, they may be a
[45:49] Christian, but what they're doing is
[45:51] they're adapting to less and less rain
[45:54] and they're getting used to being out of
[45:57] the house of God. They're getting used
[45:58] to not being under the blessings of God.
[46:00] They're getting used to not really
[46:02] feeling the presence of God. Maybe even
[46:04] if they're in church, but there's a
[46:06] desert time going on in their life and
[46:08] they're they've just gotten used to
[46:09] that. And so they've always lived there,
[46:12] maybe a sinner, they've never
[46:14] experienced the blessing of God. They've
[46:16] never really experienced the what what
[46:18] the Holy Spirit can do in a life. So to
[46:21] them, they just do what they do. They
[46:23] It's nothing strange. All All the plants
[46:25] have thorns on them. All the all the
[46:28] plants are cacti of some sort. And and
[46:30] everything's sparse. They don't think
[46:32] nothing of it. But yet, if you crossed
[46:35] into that, you would recognize that it
[46:37] was a desert. That's right. So, what
[46:39] happens is a flower in the desert gets
[46:42] less and less rain. And so, it begins to
[46:45] protect the rain that it has. And the
[46:49] way that it does that is it protects
[46:50] itself from two things. It protects
[46:52] itself from herbivores, which are uh
[46:55] animals that eat plants, and it protects
[46:57] itself from evaporation.
[47:00] So in order to do that, it it rolls up.
[47:03] And so uh you take something that had a
[47:06] leaf on it would actually become a thorn
[47:08] or a sticker because what it would do is
[47:11] it's protecting itself. It's got less
[47:13] surface area to evaporate from and it
[47:16] protects it from the animals because it
[47:18] can no longer really fulfill its
[47:21] purpose, its original purpose because we
[47:23] know in the beginning there was no
[47:25] desert at all.
[47:27] God didn't create
[47:30] deserts. So, and uh there there's a uh
[47:34] there there's a a thing when we need to
[47:36] recognize that that uh the modern cactus
[47:39] actually come from a member of the rose
[47:42] family if you can believe it. It's it's
[47:44] a flower called pescia which has no
[47:47] thorns or stickers at all. They're still
[47:50] found in South America where there's
[47:51] more rain. But you take your sorro
[47:54] cactus or your jumping cactus or or
[47:56] choya cactus, something like that. They
[47:58] were once a flower, right? They they
[48:01] actually were a flower, a beautiful
[48:03] flower that that the deer could come by
[48:05] and eat and and the leaves would uh
[48:08] would would would be rolled out and be
[48:10] wonderful and beautiful to look at. But
[48:12] now they're full of thorns and stickers.
[48:14] We know that that was actually the curse
[48:16] that was given to Adam in Genesis 3:17.
[48:19] unto Adam he said, "Because thou was
[48:22] hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and
[48:24] hast eaten of the tree of which I
[48:26] commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
[48:28] eat of it. Cursed is the ground for thy
[48:30] sake, in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
[48:33] the days of thy life." So, we understand
[48:36] that God didn't create the desert. We
[48:40] were meant the the earth was meant to be
[48:42] watered from the ground and and yet now
[48:46] we we rely on the rain. Now, uh, Brother
[48:49] Brandham uses this as a metaphor for a
[48:52] church. A and we get dry sometimes.
[48:56] We get dry and we don't even know how we
[49:00] got there. Most of the time we don't
[49:03] even recognize that there's a lack of
[49:06] water. All we we're just going through
[49:09] life. We're just doing what we've always
[49:11] done and not recognizing how long has it
[49:13] been since we really got loose and
[49:15] worshiped in the house of God. How long
[49:17] has it been since we really got down to
[49:20] business and heard from God? How long
[49:22] has it been since we wanted to go to
[49:23] church?
[49:26] Oh, come on, church. I'm I'm just going
[49:27] to preach a little bit this morning as
[49:29] best I can. But how long's it been since
[49:32] our heart was really fervent for the
[49:34] message of the hour? How long's it been
[49:36] since we really we really wanted the
[49:38] things of God and we we hung on to every
[49:40] word that was being preached? How long's
[49:42] it been since we really wanted to serve
[49:45] God with all of our heart? You remember
[49:46] if you've ever been saved? If you've
[49:48] ever had an experience with God, you
[49:50] remember what it was like when you first
[49:52] got saved. You remember the joy that you
[49:54] had in your heart. I see our elders in
[49:56] the back raising their hand. They know
[49:57] what it was to be born again, to uh to
[50:00] to change, have their lives changed, to
[50:02] come out of denominationalism, to come
[50:04] out of those things. And the joy that
[50:06] you found in the message of the hour.
[50:08] What a blessing that it was to pick up a
[50:10] book or a tape or to listen to an old
[50:12] realtore recording. There was a joy in
[50:14] reading your Bible.
[50:17] But over time, things change. That's
[50:19] right. We find ourselves many times in a
[50:22] desert condition. Yeah. And we don't
[50:25] even know it.
[50:28] Now, Brother Brandon said this. He said,
[50:30] "You know, I travel around over the
[50:31] world a lot and one of the most
[50:35] stickerest, nastiest places to try to
[50:38] lay down is in the desert.
[50:41] I wouldn't even think about it just for
[50:43] the snakes if nothing else.
[50:46] But you know they say there's no more
[50:47] snakes in the desert than anywhere else.
[50:48] It's just that you can see them.
[50:52] But everything in the desert has got a
[50:54] sticker on it. He said, "You know why?
[50:58] Every kind of a little old weed is a
[51:00] cactus.
[51:02] You can't lay down nowhere. It's
[51:04] sticking you." The reason of it is they
[51:06] ain't got no water. Water makes it soft.
[51:11] Water makes it soft. He said, "Where
[51:14] there's lots of water, you don't have
[51:16] any thorns and thistles
[51:19] where there's lots of
[51:20] water." He said, "I tell you, brother,
[51:22] you take an old church that's dry in his
[51:25] bone."
[51:27] Come on, church. I'm not calling you dry
[51:29] this morning, but we need to make sure
[51:31] we don't ever get in this condition.
[51:33] That's right. You take an old church
[51:35] that's dry in his bone and no Holy Ghost
[51:37] in it and no salvation, no divine
[51:40] healing, no power of God, no shouting.
[51:44] Come on. I heard a a a message preacher
[51:47] say, "Well, well, why would we shout?"
[51:49] You know, well, Brother Brandon believed
[51:50] in shouting. And more than that, the
[51:52] Bible talks about shouting. The Bible
[51:55] says that when we were in the mind of
[51:57] God, he said, "Job, where were you when
[51:59] the sons of God when the morning stars
[52:01] stay together and the sons of God
[52:03] shouted for joy?" The Bible believes it
[52:06] taught that. And brother Brandham taught
[52:08] that. And I don't believe you have to
[52:09] shout. I don't believe it's any evidence
[52:11] of the Holy Ghost. But I do believe that
[52:13] it's part of it. It's a joy that we
[52:15] have. It's something that How long's it
[52:17] been since the church really got loose
[52:18] and worshiped God and really gave it all
[52:21] all that they had to a service?
[52:23] And maybe you're not a shoutter, but
[52:25] there's just something in your heart.
[52:26] You want you wanted to give God
[52:28] everything that you had. Come on,
[52:30] church. You You fall asleep in church.
[52:32] And I'm not talking to our elders who
[52:34] are on medication. I'm not really
[52:36] talking to our young ones like this. But
[52:38] what about us? Come on, church. I I've
[52:40] not fallen asleep in years, but I've
[52:42] gotten tired sometimes. But I'll tell
[52:44] you what, that old sleepy devil will run
[52:46] off of you if you begin to really get
[52:47] into the service. That's right.
[52:50] No power of God. No shouting, no joy.
[52:54] And it's always, "Oh, she done this."
[52:57] And he done this and he done this.
[53:00] Sticker, sticker, sticker. That's good.
[53:06] You realize sometimes we don't recognize
[53:08] God when he's here. That's right. Come
[53:10] on, church. I know it's it it's funny
[53:13] sometimes, but I watch people walk out
[53:14] of a service where the presence of God
[53:16] was so real that I know the anointing of
[53:18] God is there that they could have had
[53:20] healing or salvation and all they got
[53:22] out of the service was this was wrong or
[53:24] that was wrong or
[53:27] wasn't my favorite preacher my favorite
[53:28] singer my favorite this that or the
[53:30] other. We don't come here to worship one
[53:32] another. We don't come here to lift up
[53:34] one another. We come here to lift up the
[53:36] name of the Lord.
[53:39] Yeah.
[53:40] He said, "What you need and what we need
[53:43] this morning, what Word of Life
[53:45] Tabernacle needs is a good old-fashioned
[53:48] outpouring gusher of the Holy Ghost."
[53:52] Hallelujah. And soften up a little bit.
[53:56] He said, "A dry climate just develops
[53:58] stickers. Everything that's on it got a
[54:01] sticker. Then you change and take that
[54:04] same variety of weed and put it up in a
[54:07] country where there's a lot of rain and
[54:08] swamp. It's just as soft as it can be.
[54:13] But notice, it doesn't do that
[54:14] overnight.
[54:16] A cactus will live for a while in a wet
[54:18] environment, but it won't live for long.
[54:22] Right? A flower will live for a while in
[54:24] a dry environment, but it won't live for
[54:26] long. It either has to adapt or die,
[54:29] right? And so what happens is it adapts
[54:31] to the environment that's around it. He
[54:33] said, he said, the water makes the
[54:36] difference. And you take a people or a
[54:38] church that's just so dry. That's the
[54:42] reason it's so hard for them to say
[54:43] amen. They got to clear the dust from
[54:44] their throats. You
[54:47] know, I'm going to pass out bottles of
[54:50] water to everybody. You know, gets dusty
[54:52] out there. You can see them coming. You
[54:55] know, here comes you watch somebody come
[54:56] in. It looks like pig pin from peanuts.
[54:58] You know, the dust is just coming off of
[55:02] them or dry. They need an experience
[55:04] with God again. Come on, church. We all
[55:07] do from time to time. None of us are
[55:09] exempt from that. I don't know how many
[55:11] times I've come to the pulp and said,
[55:12] "Lord, make it real to me today. Make it
[55:15] a reality to me. Let me live it. Let me
[55:17] preach it with all of my heart. Let me
[55:19] feel it in my soul."
[55:23] Because the world will drain it out of
[55:24] you. We We all have trials. We all have
[55:28] situations in life. We all have trouble
[55:30] and that'll that'll drain it out of us.
[55:32] But we're not We don't worship God just
[55:34] in the good times. We worship him at all
[55:36] of the time because he's not just a good
[55:38] God in the good times, but he's a good
[55:40] God all the time.
[55:46] We come in with our complaints
[55:50] and our expectations Yeah. being lowered
[55:54] and it's just like a cloud of dust
[55:56] follows us in and we sit down and
[55:57] wonder, why am I so prickly? Why do I
[56:01] get my feelings hurt so easily? Why do I
[56:04] hurt other people? Why do I respond so
[56:07] sharply?
[56:10] Oh, church. It's not the people. It's
[56:14] not. You say, "Well, that person is, you
[56:16] know, if they would just change, if
[56:17] they'd just be different." But that's
[56:19] not what needs to change. What needs to
[56:22] change is me. What needs to change is is
[56:25] my heart. I need to get into a place
[56:27] where I can where it don't bother me
[56:29] like it did anymore. Oh my. Now look,
[56:33] brother Brandon says the water makes a
[56:34] difference. You take a people or church
[56:35] that's so dry they never have prayer
[56:37] meetings, they become stickers. They're
[56:40] just finding fault and sticking at one
[56:42] another. But all we need, someone say
[56:46] all we need. All we need, all Word of
[56:49] Life tabernacle needs, oh my, is a good
[56:51] rain to soften us up a little bit. Amen.
[56:54] That's good. He said, "I get into the
[56:56] desert sometime out there in Arizona and
[56:59] I notice that every little old bush on
[57:01] that desert is harmful. It'll stick you
[57:04] because it doesn't have enough water to
[57:06] take care of it. Stickers come out for a
[57:10] defense.
[57:11] Right? Because it's dry, it can't trust
[57:13] the rain. It can't trust that there will
[57:16] be a regrowth." Right? Right. So, every
[57:18] time somebody says something about it,
[57:20] it's got to say something back because
[57:22] it can't trust the Lord. the rain for a
[57:25] regrowth. So because it's dry, it's just
[57:28] everything. It's like, "Oh, he he he
[57:29] said something to me wrong. He did this
[57:31] wrong or they did that wrong." What is
[57:33] it? It's a dryness of spirit. Doesn't
[57:35] have enough water to take care of it.
[57:37] Stickers come out for a defense. He
[57:39] said, "You come back up here up in
[57:41] Oregon or somewhere where it rains all
[57:42] the time and every one of them same kind
[57:44] of bushes hasn't got a sticker on them."
[57:47] Yes, sir. He said, "See, the water keeps
[57:49] them soft." Yeah.
[57:53] And that's what's the matter with the
[57:55] church. I hope that wasn't yours,
[57:56] Brother
[57:59] David. I think it was. That's what's the
[58:02] matter with the church. When you get
[58:04] when you get all dried up and shackled
[58:06] up, I may I may lose height this
[58:09] morning.
[58:13] Sorry. He said, "That's scary right
[58:17] there. Are you with me this morning? Are
[58:20] you awake this morning?" Amen. He said
[58:22] you get all dried up and shackled up and
[58:24] everything. He said you see get so cold
[58:26] and formal and different. You don't get
[58:28] any spiritual blessing and your heart
[58:30] gets all filled up. Oh my. Full of
[58:33] indignation and wrath and everybody, oh,
[58:36] I'll get even with him. People sit in
[58:40] church for years with a grudge against a
[58:42] fellow church member
[58:45] for years and sit there waiting,
[58:48] planning, plotting the day they can
[58:51] finally get even with them. Why don't
[58:53] you just let it go this morning and say,
[58:54] "Lord, I know I need water. I know this
[58:57] isn't you. I know that you don't act
[58:58] like that. I need some water in my life.
[59:04] I'll get He said, "I'll get even with
[59:05] him. I'll get even with her. I I quit
[59:07] the church. Just a bunch of stickers
[59:09] living in a desert. Try. What you need
[59:11] is some good oldfashioned Holy Spirit
[59:13] water. Rain down upon you. Soften up
[59:15] that old hard heart. Oh, that's what we
[59:17] need this morning. So many people come
[59:19] out of a dry environment, they're so
[59:21] used to being dry that the rain feels
[59:23] like
[59:24] emotionalism. So used to being dry that
[59:26] the rain feels like, oh, they're just a
[59:28] bunch of holy rollers. No, it's just the
[59:30] rain of God coming down on people. Amen.
[59:34] Have you ever noticed what a difference
[59:36] it uh that the camp uh camps make in our
[59:39] kids? Many times when they go, what a
[59:41] difference it makes in their lives. And
[59:43] you know, the truth is they don't enjoy
[59:46] it that much physically because I know
[59:48] they like meeting their friends and
[59:49] stuff, but when you go to camp, it's
[59:51] hard, right? You're sleeping in a bunk
[59:53] with a bunch or a bunch of other people
[59:55] in the room and it's a very difficult
[59:57] time. Some of y'all can say amen to
[59:58] that.
[1:00:00] Uh, and it's not it's not easy to be uh
[1:00:04] uh to to be at the camp and that our
[1:00:06] kids are going is why I'm saying this
[1:00:07] this week, but but what they don't
[1:00:09] complain about it. Most of them
[1:00:12] don't. They don't complain about it.
[1:00:14] They don't think nothing of it. And when
[1:00:16] they come back, they're refreshed.
[1:00:19] Why?
[1:00:20] They they got some water. Yes. Amen. And
[1:00:24] sometimes we need to endure maybe a
[1:00:26] little bit of hardship and things a
[1:00:27] little bit out of order a little bit
[1:00:28] just to see just to shake us up maybe so
[1:00:31] we can get some water realize that we
[1:00:34] need it.
[1:00:36] But the kids many times they they get
[1:00:38] softened up and so they'll come back why
[1:00:41] they've been in that environment
[1:00:42] softness.
[1:00:44] Huh? And so when they get in that
[1:00:46] environment uh of the Holy Spirit moving
[1:00:49] in their life, they begin to lose that
[1:00:51] that indignation and that anger and that
[1:00:53] wrath and it get easier to deal with
[1:00:55] around the house for a while.
[1:00:58] And what have they got in the many
[1:01:01] times, you know, we say, "Well, they get
[1:01:03] the Holy Ghost over and over." We don't
[1:01:04] we know that's not true, right? They You
[1:01:06] can get refilled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:01:08] but you get sealed one time, but you can
[1:01:11] get dry. And you need sometimes to get
[1:01:14] the water on you so they come back
[1:01:16] tender and soft
[1:01:19] just in a good condition
[1:01:22] to get all hurt by us prickly be pears.
[1:01:29] Come on church and then they begin to
[1:01:32] roll up again.
[1:01:34] Why the new environment is desert. I'm
[1:01:36] not saying we're a desert as a church
[1:01:38] but we got to fight that. Israel just
[1:01:41] recently planted I say just recently a
[1:01:43] few decades ago they planted a forest in
[1:01:45] the desert.
[1:01:47] They actually planted a an entire forest
[1:01:50] of pine trees in the
[1:01:52] Ngev in in one of the driest deserts in
[1:01:55] the world. You think what in the world
[1:01:57] are you doing Israel? Well they planted
[1:01:59] it there because they know deserts don't
[1:02:01] stay the same size.
[1:02:04] Did you realize that deserts spread?
[1:02:07] they grow and over time they just spread
[1:02:10] farther and farther and farther out. So
[1:02:13] what Israel did is they planted the
[1:02:15] trees so that it would be it would stop
[1:02:18] the spread of the desert. So there's an
[1:02:21] entire national forest, man-made
[1:02:23] national forest in Israel. And the way
[1:02:25] they got the water to it is they took
[1:02:27] the salt out of seawater and they're
[1:02:29] pumping that down and then pumping water
[1:02:31] out of the Lake of Galilee and they're
[1:02:33] pumping that down into this forest so it
[1:02:36] can begin to grow and it looks as
[1:02:38] beautiful as any forest anywhere in the
[1:02:40] world. But it's actually not getting
[1:02:42] water from rain, but it's getting water
[1:02:44] from the desalinization process. But
[1:02:46] Israel realized if we don't stop it
[1:02:48] somewhere, it's going to spread. It's
[1:02:50] going to keep on going. Listen, church,
[1:02:51] if you don't stop somewhere, if you
[1:02:53] don't have an experience with God
[1:02:54] somewhere, if you never find yourself at
[1:02:56] an altar, if you never find yourself
[1:02:58] calling out to God, if you never find
[1:03:00] yourself seeking the Lord with all your
[1:03:02] heart, you'll get drier and drier and
[1:03:04] drier and drier until eventually there's
[1:03:06] nothing left but sand.
[1:03:11] Say, "But I'm a Christian." Yeah, but
[1:03:12] your environment's bad. Yeah. Atmosphere
[1:03:16] is bad. Yeah. You realize the Sahara
[1:03:18] Desert, there's once a a big ocean in
[1:03:20] the middle of it, right? Yeah. They
[1:03:22] found whales in the Sahara Desert. Whale
[1:03:25] fossils right in the middle of the
[1:03:27] Sahara Desert. They
[1:03:30] found the the remnants of petrified
[1:03:33] forests
[1:03:34] underneath all that
[1:03:36] sand. It used to be there was a time
[1:03:39] around the time of the flood that all of
[1:03:42] that whole continent was lush and the
[1:03:45] Sahara had just as much rain as the rest
[1:03:48] of Africa. But the reason it looks like
[1:03:51] it does, oh church, is because just over
[1:03:56] time when the rain stopped, it just kept
[1:03:59] getting drier and drier and drier and
[1:04:03] and all the fruits died off of it. And
[1:04:05] when the fruits died off of the flowers
[1:04:07] died, the animals left. Pretty soon, all
[1:04:10] that was left is is sand. And I've been
[1:04:12] there in the Egyptian desert. When you
[1:04:13] pick up that grain of sand, it's like
[1:04:16] glass. It's not like even the deserts
[1:04:18] there in Tucson or somewhere like that.
[1:04:20] But but it's sand. It's just like it's
[1:04:22] been blasted by nuclear power. But it
[1:04:25] did not happen overnight. It happened
[1:04:26] over thousands of
[1:04:28] years of just no water.
[1:04:34] realize why we need the house of God.
[1:04:37] Why we need each other?
[1:04:41] See, the danger is
[1:04:43] not The danger is not that you'll find
[1:04:46] yourself trapped somewhere and unable to
[1:04:48] come back. The danger is that you won't
[1:04:49] want to. That's good.
[1:04:53] It's not that you'll get to a place
[1:04:55] where you can't because there's always
[1:04:57] mercy for you. If you want mercy,
[1:04:59] there's always mercy. It's not that that
[1:05:01] you'll get to a place where there's no
[1:05:02] mercy. It's that you'll get to a place
[1:05:04] where you don't want any. That's right.
[1:05:10] Brother Brandon
[1:05:12] says, he says, "Everything in the desert
[1:05:14] has a sticker on it. Any little plant
[1:05:16] you come to, don't get near it. It'll
[1:05:19] stick you. It's always got its stickers
[1:05:22] out, ready to stick." Oh my. Anything
[1:05:28] that comes near it. What's the matter?
[1:05:30] What made it a sticker? Is because it
[1:05:33] had no water. I know I'm being very
[1:05:35] direct this morning, but as your pastor,
[1:05:36] I've got to do this sometimes because I
[1:05:38] feel like I need to be preached to
[1:05:40] directly as well. I need to be reminded
[1:05:43] of a little song that says, "It's not my
[1:05:45] brother, not my sister, but it's me, oh
[1:05:47] Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[1:05:50] It's not the new people. It's not the
[1:05:52] old people. It's not the young people.
[1:05:53] It's not the middle-aged people. What?
[1:05:55] It's me, Lord. I'm the one that needs
[1:05:58] the water." Because if I could get the
[1:06:00] water, maybe my children could get the
[1:06:02] water, maybe the young people could get
[1:06:03] the water, maybe the atmosphere of the
[1:06:05] service would
[1:06:10] change. He said, "What's the matter?" He
[1:06:12] said, "What made it a sticker?" It's
[1:06:13] because it had no water. That's what
[1:06:15] dried it up. That sticker is a leaf
[1:06:16] rolled up. For the lack of water, it
[1:06:19] becomes a sticker. That's a scientific
[1:06:22] fact. But the Brandon was not just using
[1:06:23] an analogy. It's what actually happens.
[1:06:27] He said, "Thus it is with the church
[1:06:28] today that when the church gets away
[1:06:29] from the fountain of life, when it gets
[1:06:32] away from the joys of salvation, when it
[1:06:34] gets away from the Lord God, then that
[1:06:37] person becomes a sticker." Yes, sir.
[1:06:40] Always finding fault sticking. No sooner
[1:06:43] you come up, I'm
[1:06:45] Presbyterian. I'm a Methodist. I'm so
[1:06:48] and so.
[1:06:50] We do that in the message, too.
[1:06:53] I belong to brother so and so's church.
[1:06:56] Where do you go to church?
[1:07:00] Don't talk to me about that stuff. I'm
[1:07:02] I'm okay where I'm at. A sticker. It has
[1:07:05] no fruits. He said, "You take that same
[1:07:08] plant, cactus, and put it into a land
[1:07:13] for a few generations." You realize what
[1:07:15] we're trying to do here? We're not
[1:07:17] building for today.
[1:07:19] We're building for generations to come.
[1:07:21] You say, "Well, the Lord's coming."
[1:07:22] Absolutely.
[1:07:24] I believe that if he comes tomorrow,
[1:07:26] we'll be ready. If he comes a week from
[1:07:28] now, we'll be ready. If he comes in 10
[1:07:31] generations, we'll be ready. But we
[1:07:33] plant our potatoes now for generations
[1:07:36] to come. So, we're getting ready for the
[1:07:39] next generation. So, what we're doing,
[1:07:41] he said, you put that plant, that
[1:07:42] cactus, put a little cactus, like one of
[1:07:44] these young people, into a land for a
[1:07:47] few
[1:07:48] generations where there's plenty of
[1:07:50] water.
[1:07:52] Oh, church. And that sticker will unfold
[1:07:56] and it will come a soft leaf bearing
[1:07:59] fruit. I want to see every one of our
[1:08:01] young people bearing fruit. I want to
[1:08:03] see every one of us bearing fruit. How
[1:08:05] are we going to do that? We've got to
[1:08:06] start today. Lord, send the water. We
[1:08:09] need rain.
[1:08:16] He said you it'll become a soft leaf
[1:08:18] bearing fruit. In the 17th chapter of
[1:08:21] Exodus, Moses brings the children of
[1:08:23] Israel to Mount
[1:08:24] Horeb. Horeb the the name it's Horeb is
[1:08:28] actually the surrounding the incline
[1:08:30] that goes up to Mount
[1:08:32] Si. Horeb means a dry place or a
[1:08:37] desert. And I love the fact that it was
[1:08:39] Horeb where Moses went and and the
[1:08:43] people were complaining about no
[1:08:45] water. And Moses, remember, goes out and
[1:08:49] God says, "Speak to the rock." So he
[1:08:52] takes the driest thing in in a dry
[1:08:54] place. Horb means dry place or desert.
[1:08:59] He takes the driest thing in the driest
[1:09:01] place and says, "Speak to that and it'll
[1:09:05] bring forth water." You say, "Brother
[1:09:06] Ben, it's it's too late for me or or I'm
[1:09:09] a solid Christian. I don't need that
[1:09:11] anymore." I pray that God that you would
[1:09:14] speak this morning and say, "Lord, I
[1:09:16] need that water from the rock, that
[1:09:18] everpresent water from the rock, I need
[1:09:20] though I might be dry, though the the
[1:09:22] the environment around me might be dry,
[1:09:24] but I don't have to stay that way. The
[1:09:26] rock can be spoken to this morning and
[1:09:28] it'll bring forth water." Yes, sir. Now,
[1:09:32] Moses, you remember, went and struck it
[1:09:34] twice and it broke every type in the
[1:09:36] Bible. He didn't need to strike it. He
[1:09:38] was told to speak to it. Right. Yet God
[1:09:41] honored the prophet. A and so we're it's
[1:09:44] not our job to to force people into a
[1:09:48] relationship with God. It's not our job
[1:09:50] to force people into church. Are you
[1:09:52] with me now? It's not our job to smite
[1:09:54] it. He's already the the sacrifice has
[1:09:56] already been made. What do we do? We
[1:09:58] speak to it. Lord, I believe there's
[1:10:00] water. He said, "Ask so that your joy
[1:10:03] could be full."
[1:10:05] I know it's simple this morning, but I
[1:10:07] just want us to just really really bear
[1:10:09] this in our spirits and really just just
[1:10:12] just meditate on it this
[1:10:14] morning. Brother Brand said, "See a
[1:10:16] desert, a little piece of cactus." Let
[1:10:18] me back up there. He said, "When we get
[1:10:20] out of fellowship with one another in
[1:10:21] the church and out of fellowship with
[1:10:23] the Holy Spirit, it brings us to a dry
[1:10:26] place, a desert, nothing alive.
[1:10:29] Everything got stickers on it,
[1:10:32] you know. You cannot be habitually. And
[1:10:36] I'm not I'm not preaching at you this
[1:10:38] morning. It's Sunday morning. So, we got
[1:10:40] our Sunday morning crowd. And I
[1:10:42] appreciate you being
[1:10:43] here. But but you can't be out of church
[1:10:46] habitually and not get dry. It's
[1:10:49] impossible.
[1:10:53] You can't quit praying habitually
[1:10:56] and not get dry. Yeah. You can't quit
[1:11:00] reading your Bible habitually
[1:11:02] and not get dry.
[1:11:05] Are you with me now? There's times when
[1:11:07] I know things interrupt and there's
[1:11:09] things we have to do. But if you get in
[1:11:11] the habit of
[1:11:12] desert, you can't you can't have the
[1:11:15] lack of rain and not have the
[1:11:17] environment that comes with it.
[1:11:21] See, brother Brandon says a desert, he
[1:11:24] said, a little piece of cactus with that
[1:11:26] sticker on it. Do you know what that is?
[1:11:27] That's a precious little tender leaf.
[1:11:32] You say, "Well, if they're a sticker,
[1:11:33] then you just need to run them out of
[1:11:34] the church." No. That's a precious
[1:11:37] little tender leaf.
[1:11:39] That hasn't had no water. It's just
[1:11:42] wound itself up so tight till it's a
[1:11:46] sticker.
[1:11:48] That's why it can't respond to the word
[1:11:50] anymore. It's just wound up so tight.
[1:11:53] anything you say to it, it it it snaps
[1:11:55] back at you because it's wound up so
[1:11:57] tight. You got to walk around like
[1:11:58] you're on eggshells because it's wound
[1:12:00] up so tight till it's a sticker. Oh God,
[1:12:03] help me not to be like that. He said,
[1:12:05] when you see somebody like that, maybe
[1:12:07] it's a precious soul, that could have
[1:12:10] been watered, right? Would have been a
[1:12:12] tender little leaf or something, but
[1:12:14] instead of that, it's wound itself up.
[1:12:18] You know how we we wind ourselves up for
[1:12:20] protection? Yeah. We get it home and we
[1:12:22] start thinking about it. Brother so and
[1:12:25] so didn't shake my
[1:12:27] hand. That old herbivore come over and
[1:12:29] started to try to take off my
[1:12:31] leaves. Well, that's what you were made
[1:12:34] for. Leaves of fellowship. But you you
[1:12:37] start withdrawing it. You wind yourself
[1:12:40] up. Well, the pastor doesn't love me.
[1:12:43] The people don't love me. I'm just old.
[1:12:46] I'm no count. No good. You're always
[1:12:49] valuable in the kingdom of God. I don't
[1:12:51] care how old you are, how weak you are,
[1:12:53] what's happened to your body, you have
[1:12:55] value in the house of God.
[1:12:58] I watched our elders come in this
[1:13:00] morning. At one point this morning, all
[1:13:02] that was here was that back
[1:13:04] row. And I got to looking at that and I
[1:13:06] actually took a picture of it on my
[1:13:07] phone because I thought, Lord, keep our
[1:13:09] elders around because it's such an
[1:13:11] encouragement to me because they show up
[1:13:13] to the house of God in anticipation
[1:13:15] early waiting, praying on the and if we
[1:13:18] have a good service, many times it's not
[1:13:19] because of me, but it's because of them
[1:13:21] back there praying and lifting their
[1:13:23] hands and worshiping and praising God.
[1:13:25] Oh, then it could be all of us this
[1:13:27] morning.
[1:13:28] We don't want to be a rolled up sticker.
[1:13:30] We want to be a precious little tinder
[1:13:32] leaf that has water. Yeah. But he said
[1:13:36] it just tight. So tight till it's a
[1:13:37] sticker. Our other elders scattered
[1:13:39] through the building as well. I'm so
[1:13:41] thankful for you, but let's never become
[1:13:43] a a wound up little little needle that
[1:13:46] just picks at everything. But let's be a
[1:13:48] leaf that can be eaten off of that that
[1:13:50] the water can evaporate. But there's
[1:13:52] more water.
[1:13:56] It's just wound itself up till it's a
[1:13:58] sticker. Said just punching at
[1:14:00] everything, you know, finding
[1:14:02] fault. Only thing it needs is just
[1:14:06] water. Brother Danny told a a wonderful
[1:14:09] story in our elders thing. I think we
[1:14:12] put it on Facebook. So many of you have
[1:14:13] heard it. Brother Danny tells the story
[1:14:15] and I've heard him tell it before, but
[1:14:17] it's wonderful because it just tells
[1:14:19] you, you know, it's all a frame of mind.
[1:14:20] It's how you think about things.
[1:14:22] because people were uh you know,
[1:14:25] somebody complained to him about the
[1:14:27] temperature in the church and he said
[1:14:29] back then they had the type of maybe the
[1:14:31] ones we have now. I'm not sure. Hope it
[1:14:32] wasn't one of you,
[1:14:33] but I don't think it
[1:14:37] was. But he said they were complaining
[1:14:40] about the temperature in the church and
[1:14:42] they were too hot or too cold and and so
[1:14:45] he said he walked over to the to the
[1:14:47] temperature to the thermostat and he
[1:14:49] punched the button. And of course, the
[1:14:50] light comes on, but he didn't change
[1:14:52] nothing. He just punched the button, the
[1:14:54] light come on, walked over and sat down
[1:14:56] cuz the temperature was what it was
[1:14:57] supposed to be. So, he gets done doing
[1:15:00] that and after church, they come to him
[1:15:02] and said, "Brother, uh, we're we're just
[1:15:04] so glad, Brother Danny, we're we're
[1:15:06] we're so happy that you fixed that."
[1:15:08] Said, "We were so
[1:15:09] hot and as soon as you punch that
[1:15:12] button, boy, everything's okay now." You
[1:15:14] know,
[1:15:15] we could sit there. What was it? It's
[1:15:17] just all in the mind, right? It's just
[1:15:20] all in the mind. I'm not saying there's
[1:15:22] not real things that happen. Sometimes
[1:15:23] it's too loud. Sometimes it's
[1:15:24] uncomfortable. Sometimes it's too quiet.
[1:15:26] Sometimes it's you just need to move
[1:15:27] somewhere else. I mean, across the
[1:15:29] aisle, not out of church.
[1:15:31] But sometimes you you get you get to a
[1:15:34] place where it's like that. And I
[1:15:36] recognize that sometimes we do have it
[1:15:37] too loud. Sometimes we do have it too
[1:15:39] quiet. Sometimes we don't get everything
[1:15:41] right. But what are we here for?
[1:15:45] What are we here for? We're not here to
[1:15:48] complain. We're not here to see one
[1:15:50] another. We're not here to be
[1:15:52] comfortable. We're here to serve the
[1:15:54] Lord. And sometimes he puts us in a
[1:15:57] trying place to see what we'll do. And
[1:16:00] we ought to serve him with all of our
[1:16:02] heart. Brother Brandon says it he said
[1:16:04] it's just fine as Paul. The only things
[1:16:06] it it needs is just water. That's all it
[1:16:08] just it needs a revival, a breaking up,
[1:16:10] a refreshing from the Lord. It'll unfold
[1:16:12] its little self. See if you'll just put
[1:16:15] it to the water. But that's where them
[1:16:17] who live in that place. Listen, here's
[1:16:20] the danger of living in a place where
[1:16:22] you never get moved by the spirit of
[1:16:26] God. You never get moved by the
[1:16:28] atmosphere of God. He the word doesn't
[1:16:30] move you anymore. Those who live in that
[1:16:32] place has to suffer with the conditions
[1:16:36] of that place.
[1:16:38] And those who desire to live in that
[1:16:40] kind of an atmosphere where everything
[1:16:42] is just punching and fussing and
[1:16:44] quarreling and stewing. I hope that
[1:16:47] don't sound like home.
[1:16:49] Come on church. Hope it don't sound like
[1:16:52] our
[1:16:53] homes. I watch kids and I'm so proud of
[1:16:56] ours cuz our older ones are all at home
[1:16:58] and and doing what's right and they're
[1:17:00] not just But I've seen situations where
[1:17:02] every time a kid turned 18, man, he
[1:17:04] wanted to be out of the house. Why?
[1:17:06] Because house was a bad atmosphere. They
[1:17:08] might have been Christians. They might
[1:17:09] have been deacons. They might have been
[1:17:11] they might have been trustees or even
[1:17:13] preachers, but home was a bad
[1:17:15] atmosphere. Everybody was quarreling and
[1:17:17] stewing. Oh, they had long hair and and
[1:17:19] they didn't paint their face. And maybe
[1:17:20] they were ever so legalistic, but home
[1:17:22] was so quarrelome that they felt like
[1:17:25] they needed to get out just as soon. Oh,
[1:17:27] God, help us not to raise our children
[1:17:28] that way. Those who live under that
[1:17:30] atmosphere have to suffer under those
[1:17:33] conditions. But I don't want a church
[1:17:35] that's a desert. I don't want to go to a
[1:17:37] church that's a desert. I don't want to
[1:17:39] be a part of a church that's a desert. I
[1:17:41] don't want to be the pastor of a church
[1:17:42] that's a desert. I don't want to have a
[1:17:44] home that's a desert. I want God to be
[1:17:46] able to move everywhere.
[1:17:48] Everywhere I am. Let me be in revival.
[1:17:50] Lord, this is the hour of the bride's
[1:17:52] revival. Let me be a part of that.
[1:18:00] The devil will tell you you need less
[1:18:01] water.
[1:18:03] Really what you need is more.
[1:18:08] I tell you the problem in your life is
[1:18:10] because you just go to church too much.
[1:18:13] And if you just let go a little bit and
[1:18:15] just start to drift, things get easier.
[1:18:17] And it does get easier for a
[1:18:19] while. Because if you were going up the
[1:18:21] river up this spring river and you were
[1:18:24] going up river rowing, might be almost
[1:18:27] impossible to row against that current.
[1:18:28] But if you were rowing with your
[1:18:31] paddles, with your
[1:18:32] ores, as soon as you let go, you'd feel
[1:18:35] relief,
[1:18:38] you would. But look where you're going,
[1:18:41] huh? Your muscles would quit aching. You
[1:18:44] quit
[1:18:44] sweating, right? Because you're not
[1:18:46] you're not pulling anymore. You're just
[1:18:49] ro you're just floating. But where are
[1:18:51] you going? There's rocks in the river,
[1:18:53] right? You you've lost control of the
[1:18:55] trajectory of your life. Oh, I'd say we
[1:18:58] need to give that control to the Holy
[1:18:59] Spirit today.
[1:19:02] Them where them who live in that place
[1:19:04] has to suffer with the conditions of
[1:19:06] that place. And those who desire to live
[1:19:09] in that kind of an atmosphere where
[1:19:10] everything is just punching and fussing
[1:19:11] and quarreling and stewing, he said,
[1:19:13] "Well, you'll just live under that
[1:19:14] atmosphere. That's all." But we don't
[1:19:16] have to live there. He said, "It's not
[1:19:19] necessary for us to stay there."
[1:19:23] Right?
[1:19:25] Brother Brandon said, "Carnity cut off
[1:19:27] their spiritual supply. Carnality cut
[1:19:29] off all their joy." They began murmuring
[1:19:32] and fussing and took them off into the
[1:19:33] desert. He said, "If anything I hate is
[1:19:35] a desert, it's hot. There's nobody
[1:19:36] hardly can live there. Everything you
[1:19:38] get against the desert got stickers on
[1:19:39] it. Every kind of little old vine's got
[1:19:41] stickers on it." You know why? It's
[1:19:43] because there's no water there. Now, if
[1:19:44] that same little plant grew up in my
[1:19:46] country or in a country that's got rain
[1:19:47] on it, that little plant would not be a
[1:19:48] sticker. That little sticker would
[1:19:50] unfold. It would be a nice tender leaf
[1:19:52] when it comes into a watered place. He
[1:19:54] said, "That's what's the matter with the
[1:19:56] churches, the reason they fuss."
[1:20:00] Come on, church. Why do churches fuss
[1:20:01] with one another? Why do pastors
[1:20:03] quarrel? It's not a sign of godliness.
[1:20:09] It's a sign of no water. Amen. Reason
[1:20:12] they fuss and quarrel and stew and
[1:20:14] so-called Christians because they've
[1:20:16] been bypassed from the land of blessing,
[1:20:18] from the fountain that never runs dry,
[1:20:19] from the rock and the weary land. And
[1:20:21] they've become dry and carnal. They want
[1:20:23] to stick and say, "Dave, some of
[1:20:24] miracles has passed. That's a bunch of
[1:20:25] holy rollers." No such thing as that.
[1:20:27] Oh, just let them come to the water one
[1:20:29] time. They just unfold and get tender
[1:20:31] and sweet, kind and humble. Something
[1:20:34] takes place when you put them in water.
[1:20:36] I don't know why, but it happens that
[1:20:38] way. He said, "Oh, carnality had cut
[1:20:40] them off."
[1:20:42] Excuse me. Look here. Here's what they
[1:20:44] had done. He said they left the garlic
[1:20:46] pots of Egypt to eat angels
[1:20:50] food and was
[1:20:53] complaining. Yes, sir. Could you think
[1:20:56] of it? Yes, we see it. He said, "Also,
[1:20:58] they left the muddy waters of Egypt to
[1:21:00] drink from that spiritual rock still
[1:21:03] complaining about it. They left the
[1:21:05] boasting physicians of Egypt that
[1:21:07] boasted how great they were to be with
[1:21:08] the great physician." And there wasn't.
[1:21:10] Their clothes didn't get threadbear.
[1:21:13] They're standing there complaining and
[1:21:15] and they didn't even ever have to take a
[1:21:17] trip to J C Penney
[1:21:19] or Walmart or the yard
[1:21:22] sale, wherever it is that they that they
[1:21:25] bought their clothes. They didn't even
[1:21:27] have to ever make new clothes
[1:21:30] or buy new shoes or make new sandals
[1:21:34] because God took care of them. There
[1:21:37] wasn't a feeble one among them when they
[1:21:40] come from the wilderness still
[1:21:43] complaining. He said then they they had
[1:21:45] also left the people that said the days
[1:21:46] of miracles has passed to be with people
[1:21:48] that's got signs following the
[1:21:50] believers. He said isn't that just the
[1:21:52] same today? You come up out of that old
[1:21:54] cold formal stuff got the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:56] God fills you with goodness and you're
[1:21:58] drinking from that fountain that never
[1:21:59] runs dry. All them things they're joy
[1:22:01] unspeakable and full of glory and then
[1:22:03] go to complaining. Just the same thing.
[1:22:04] First thing you know, you're bypassed
[1:22:06] off out into the desert. That's the way
[1:22:08] God does it. It's just that way. He
[1:22:10] said, "God doesn't do it. The people
[1:22:11] does it themselves. Their own carnal
[1:22:13] thinking does it." Yeah.
[1:22:17] And God allows it to test us. Look,
[1:22:20] Brother Brandham said the Methodists did
[1:22:21] that. The Pentecostals did that. If you
[1:22:22] look at the age, he said they got to
[1:22:24] picking at one another. They got out off
[1:22:26] the off the line the the line of God. If
[1:22:30] not, the Methodists would have become
[1:22:31] the Pentecostals and the Pentecostals
[1:22:32] would have become the message. But they
[1:22:34] got off of the path. They got out there
[1:22:37] and the rain
[1:22:38] stopped. And the first day they didn't
[1:22:40] notice cuz oh it don't rain every day
[1:22:42] anyway. But the farther they get into
[1:22:45] the desert, the worse it gets. Amen.
[1:22:50] Deuteronomy 11:16 says, "Take heed to
[1:22:52] yourselves that your heart be not
[1:22:53] deceived. You turn aside and serve other
[1:22:55] gods and worship them. And then the
[1:22:57] Lord's wrath be kindled against you and
[1:22:58] you he shut up the heaven. there be no
[1:23:01] rain that the land yield not her fruit
[1:23:02] le she perish quickly from off the good
[1:23:04] land which the Lord giveth you. See
[1:23:06] wherever the word is given out and
[1:23:08] received in the right way wherever the
[1:23:10] word is given preeminence in life the
[1:23:13] reign of the spirit anoints that word.
[1:23:16] Yeah.
[1:23:19] You know, many times we're looking for
[1:23:21] God to take something away from us when
[1:23:23] really what all we need is a reign of
[1:23:25] the Holy Spirit in our life and and to
[1:23:28] make the word preeminent,
[1:23:31] right? Because that's what brings the
[1:23:32] reign of the Holy Spirit. He's telling
[1:23:34] them, "If you go into idolatry, you're
[1:23:36] going to have less water. I'm going to
[1:23:39] take away the rain. If you fall into
[1:23:41] idolatry, things aren't going to be the
[1:23:42] same." Oh, church. Well, what's he
[1:23:46] telling them? If you do that, things are
[1:23:48] going to be things are going to be mixed
[1:23:50] up and you're going to comp start
[1:23:51] complaining and it's going to get dry.
[1:23:54] Why? Because you put something else
[1:23:56] first. So, what's the antidote to that?
[1:23:58] Put the word first. Let the word have
[1:24:01] preeminence. Let Christ have the
[1:24:02] preeminence in your life.
[1:24:05] See, when the word is an afterthought or
[1:24:07] has no preeminent place, the reign of
[1:24:08] the spirit stops. Deuteronomy 11:18,
[1:24:11] "Therefore shall you lay up these my
[1:24:12] words in your heart and your soul. Bind
[1:24:14] them for a sign upon your hand, that
[1:24:16] they may be as frontless between your
[1:24:17] eyes, and you shall teach them to your
[1:24:19] children, speaking of them when thou
[1:24:21] sitest in thy house, when thou walst by
[1:24:23] the way, when thou liest down, when thou
[1:24:25] raise up." These young people that want
[1:24:27] to be baptized, when they when they have
[1:24:29] a desire to do that, many times I
[1:24:31] understand that's because their parents
[1:24:32] have been talking about it. Their
[1:24:35] parents have been talking about the
[1:24:36] importance of being baptized. They've
[1:24:37] heard the pastor talk about the
[1:24:38] importance of being baptized. What is
[1:24:40] that we're teaching our children the
[1:24:41] next generation and something strikes
[1:24:43] that little heart and they want to be
[1:24:44] baptized. I say let's get them to the
[1:24:46] water just as quickly as we can because
[1:24:49] we we we've preached Acts 2:38. Repent
[1:24:51] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:24:52] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:24:54] of sin and you shall receive the gift of
[1:24:55] the Holy Ghost. And a heart that's
[1:24:57] tender receives that. And they want to
[1:25:00] do that. What is it? They're making the
[1:25:01] word preeminent in their lives. Oh, that
[1:25:03] we can make every word, not just Acts
[1:25:05] two, but every word of the scripture
[1:25:07] preeminent in our life.
[1:25:10] Huh? He said, "Write them on the
[1:25:12] doorpost of your house, upon your gates,
[1:25:14] that your days may be multiplied in the
[1:25:17] days of your children in the land which
[1:25:18] the Lord swear to your fathers to give
[1:25:20] them. It's the days of heaven upon the
[1:25:22] earth." When love for God and his word
[1:25:24] is the primary thing, the rain comes and
[1:25:26] the leaves are soft. Yeah.
[1:25:31] You think about the church of Pentecost.
[1:25:33] I'm sorry for taking it kind of slow
[1:25:34] this morning, but I'm just fighting my
[1:25:37] my I'm I'm fighting them trees out
[1:25:41] there. How did the church of Pentecost
[1:25:44] we read about in Acts become the Council
[1:25:46] of Na
[1:25:48] where other gods were worshiped, right?
[1:25:51] Right. Where they changed everything and
[1:25:54] the church became the Roman Catholic
[1:25:56] Church.
[1:25:57] How over a short 300year period did that
[1:26:02] happen? Jesus described to his disciples
[1:26:05] what would happen in Matthew 24:9 says,
[1:26:08] "Then shall they deliver you up to be
[1:26:09] afflicted and shall kill you. You shall
[1:26:11] be hated of all nations for my name's
[1:26:13] sake, and then shall many be offended,
[1:26:16] and shall betray one another, and shall
[1:26:18] hate one another, and many false
[1:26:20] prophets shall rise, and shall deceive
[1:26:22] many." Listen, when you hate your
[1:26:24] brother, you open yourself up to
[1:26:26] deception.
[1:26:27] Yeah. Many people think that if they'll
[1:26:30] close themselves off from everybody,
[1:26:31] they won't be deceived. And that's
[1:26:33] actually not what he says. But you hate
[1:26:35] your brother and you open yourself up.
[1:26:37] False prophets rise. And because
[1:26:39] iniquity shall abound, the love of many
[1:26:44] shall wax cold. Shall wax cold. The
[1:26:48] Greek word for wax is to breathe gently.
[1:26:54] It's
[1:26:55] a a breeze which is like evaporation, an
[1:26:59] unnoticeable breeze or
[1:27:02] breath. It's a reduction of
[1:27:05] temperature by
[1:27:06] evaporation. The love of many shall
[1:27:10] evaporate. That's right. Now, think
[1:27:13] about it for a minute. Shall evaporate.
[1:27:16] Wax cold. And that's exactly what the
[1:27:18] church did. A cup of water sitting on a
[1:27:21] table appears to just sit there. If you
[1:27:24] took a a cup of water and filled it, or
[1:27:26] if I took this water, put this one under
[1:27:29] here. If I took this water
[1:27:33] and and I opened
[1:27:35] it, it's just an excuse to get a drink
[1:27:39] and open this water. You don't see
[1:27:42] any happening to the water. In fact, I
[1:27:45] could sit here all through the service.
[1:27:47] You'd never see anything happen. Right?
[1:27:49] Come on now. Right. It looked pretty
[1:27:52] good. Still looks pretty
[1:27:54] full. But if you put it on a digital
[1:27:56] scale,
[1:27:58] that number would move constantly.
[1:28:02] This water would actually lose volume
[1:28:04] and weight constantly.
[1:28:08] Every
[1:28:09] second. Billions of molecules
[1:28:13] are lost every second.
[1:28:16] So, it evaporates into the air. It takes
[1:28:20] about 16 minutes to evaporate a single
[1:28:23] drop of
[1:28:25] water. 16 minutes. So, it's something
[1:28:29] you would never notice, but if you left
[1:28:32] a glass of water, maybe like a 12 oz
[1:28:34] glass, probably not this big, but if you
[1:28:36] left a a 12 oz glass of water and you
[1:28:38] left it on a
[1:28:40] table in around 10 days, you didn't know
[1:28:43] you going to science class this morning.
[1:28:47] I like it cuz I never went to science
[1:28:49] class. But you take a 12 oz glass of
[1:28:52] water and you set it there for 10 days
[1:28:54] and come back. There's no water left.
[1:28:57] It's bone dry. Come on. What happened to
[1:29:01] it? The same thing that was happening to
[1:29:03] it all the time. The same thing that's
[1:29:05] happening to it right now. Come on. It's
[1:29:08] sitting there losing billions of
[1:29:11] molecules a second. And on that scale,
[1:29:16] it's evaporating. The same thing happens
[1:29:18] in our lives. Now, our soul is sealed by
[1:29:20] the Holy Ghost, right? That's why a
[1:29:23] person who's not sealed by the Holy
[1:29:24] Ghost would be up and down, in and out,
[1:29:26] and never can find their place. But a
[1:29:28] person who's sealed, they they the
[1:29:30] inside is taken care of, but your body
[1:29:33] and spirit are never converted until we
[1:29:36] leave here. How many knows that? So,
[1:29:38] twothirds of you is unsaved. So the
[1:29:41] spirit of God that affects you, that has
[1:29:43] influence over you, over your body and
[1:29:45] over your spirit, you you you'll come to
[1:29:47] church, you'll get so filled with the
[1:29:49] word, your mind will be full of the
[1:29:50] word, you'll believe the word, your body
[1:29:52] will begin to react to it, and then you
[1:29:54] leave. And every day it's evaporating, a
[1:29:58] little more every day, a little more, a
[1:30:01] little more. And if you stay out of
[1:30:05] church, then you begin to want to stay
[1:30:07] out of church. That's right.
[1:30:10] Right. And eventually, it doesn't matter
[1:30:12] if you're in church or not.
[1:30:15] It just slowly
[1:30:16] evaporated. It just the the desire
[1:30:20] evaporated, right? Oh, church. But he's
[1:30:23] still there.
[1:30:26] But what do you need? You need water.
[1:30:28] You need to refill what's been lost.
[1:30:31] That's why we need a refilling of the
[1:30:32] Holy Ghost. The refilling of the Holy
[1:30:34] Ghost is not for our soul. True. Yeah.
[1:30:37] Right. It's for these outer parts of us.
[1:30:41] That the Holy Spirit needs to anoint our
[1:30:43] flesh. Did you know it can do that? It
[1:30:46] needs to anoint our spirit, sir.
[1:30:49] That's where people get mixed up. They
[1:30:51] say, "Well, there's there's nothing to
[1:30:53] the anointing of the flesh. I don't want
[1:30:54] no anointing of the flesh. I don't want
[1:30:55] no anointing of the spirit." And someone
[1:30:57] has said, they said, "I don't want to be
[1:30:58] in the flesh." Well, what else are you
[1:31:00] going to be in?
[1:31:02] I don't want to worship in the flesh. We
[1:31:03] always worship in the flesh,
[1:31:06] right? But but but it has to be
[1:31:08] something that comes a desire that comes
[1:31:09] from the heart. But you got to yield to
[1:31:12] that because the old man is still going
[1:31:14] to fight you that body of death. Paul
[1:31:16] says, "Who shall deliver me from the
[1:31:18] body of this death?" It's an evaporation
[1:31:20] off of your life constantly. The fruits
[1:31:22] of the spirit, Satan's trying to steal
[1:31:23] it from you. He's trying to steal your
[1:31:25] joy. He didn't give up when you got the
[1:31:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost. He's
[1:31:28] constantly trying to make it where you
[1:31:30] don't enjoy church no more. You don't
[1:31:31] enjoy the blessings of God no more. You
[1:31:33] don't clap along with the songs no more.
[1:31:35] you don't raise your hands no more. He's
[1:31:37] constantly doing
[1:31:38] that. And so, Brother Brandham tells us,
[1:31:41] he said, "When you say, "What's the
[1:31:42] best, what's the closest to God you've
[1:31:44] ever been?" He said, "You ought to say,
[1:31:45] "Today."
[1:31:47] Not when I got saved. Not when I got
[1:31:48] filled with the Holy Ghost, but today.
[1:31:50] Because if not, you're backsliding.
[1:31:54] But the truth is, we it evaporates. What
[1:31:57] it's doing is it it's cooling off
[1:32:01] and losing
[1:32:03] energy. Oh my. Oh my. Revelation 2:4, he
[1:32:08] speaks to that early church. He said,
[1:32:09] "Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[1:32:11] thee because thou hast left, thou hast
[1:32:16] evaporated thy first
[1:32:19] love." When did the desert get
[1:32:23] dry? No one noticed.
[1:32:25] Probably the rain stopped. The water
[1:32:28] evaporated. So to protect the water,
[1:32:31] they formed a denomination of
[1:32:34] thorns,
[1:32:36] stickers. And brother Brandon says this
[1:32:38] way. He said, "The fervent desire to
[1:32:40] please God, the passion to know his
[1:32:43] word, the cry for reaching out in the
[1:32:45] spirit all begins to
[1:32:48] fade. And instead of that church being
[1:32:50] on fire with the fire of God, it has
[1:32:52] cooled off and become a bit formal. Just
[1:32:57] a bit."
[1:32:59] But he said, "You've left your first
[1:33:00] love." Huh? They still went to church.
[1:33:04] They still had prophets among them and
[1:33:06] and signs and wonders, but they left
[1:33:09] their first love. Right? It wasn't like
[1:33:11] it was at the first. Oh my. He said,
[1:33:15] "This that is what was happening back
[1:33:16] there to the Ephesians. They were
[1:33:18] getting a bit formal. The abandonment to
[1:33:20] God was dying out. And the people
[1:33:22] weren't too careful about what God
[1:33:23] thought of them as they began to be
[1:33:25] careful about what the world thought of
[1:33:26] them. That second generation coming on
[1:33:30] was just like Israel. They demanded a
[1:33:32] king to be like the other nations. Why?
[1:33:34] They were embarrassed by their
[1:33:36] dependence on the Holy Ghost. They were
[1:33:39] embarrassed by their dependence on a
[1:33:40] prophetic ministry. Where are we at,
[1:33:42] church? So they turned to sons of Kish,
[1:33:47] right? To to take over because they were
[1:33:49] embarrassed by their dependence on the
[1:33:50] word. I say, Lord, help me not to be
[1:33:52] embarrassed. Let let me have the water
[1:33:54] in my life so I can be ready to defend
[1:33:57] this message.
[1:34:01] Second generation, come on, was a lot
[1:34:02] like Israel. They demanded a king to be
[1:34:04] like other nations. When they did that,
[1:34:06] they rejected God. But they did it
[1:34:07] anyway. That is the history of the
[1:34:09] church. When it thinks more of
[1:34:11] conforming to the world instead of
[1:34:12] conforming to God, it isn't long until
[1:34:13] you see them stop doing things they used
[1:34:15] to do and start doing things they
[1:34:17] wouldn't do initially. They change their
[1:34:19] manner dress, their attitudes, their
[1:34:20] behavior. They get laxed. That's what
[1:34:22] Ephesus means. Relaxed and drifting.
[1:34:25] Yeah. That's when the desert got
[1:34:27] dry. The rains had been gone for a long
[1:34:31] time and now it becomes only a home for
[1:34:34] deformed plants.
[1:34:38] Fighting with each other for survival.
[1:34:42] When do we get dry? When we took a when
[1:34:44] we take a step back from fellowship with
[1:34:46] God.
[1:34:50] Samson thought he could continue doing
[1:34:52] what he always did. The anointing become
[1:34:56] deception. Hear me this morning. Become
[1:34:59] deception in his life because he could
[1:35:02] still feel the presence of God at times.
[1:35:04] The Bible said the spirit of God moved
[1:35:06] him at
[1:35:07] times right between the camps and he
[1:35:10] went out and sinned and lived his own
[1:35:13] sort of life. did whatever he wanted to
[1:35:16] and still God moved him and God used
[1:35:19] him. So he thought, I can still keep
[1:35:21] doing that and I'll be okay. Right? But
[1:35:23] one day he got in the lap of Delilah and
[1:35:27] Delilah convinced him to give up his
[1:35:29] secret. And while he slept, he never
[1:35:33] even
[1:35:34] knew. Oh, church. Isn't that how it
[1:35:38] happens with us so many times? is while
[1:35:40] we sleep. That's right. He never even
[1:35:43] knew that the joy of God was gone. Never
[1:35:45] even knew that that cry of God, that
[1:35:47] feeling that he had at the camp meeting,
[1:35:49] that feeling he had during the meeting,
[1:35:50] that feeling he had on Sunday morning
[1:35:51] that was there. And then he just laid in
[1:35:54] the lap of the world and thought, "Well,
[1:35:55] I can just keep doing what I'm doing."
[1:35:56] And eventually, what happened? He gave
[1:35:58] up his secret. And when he gave up his
[1:36:01] secret, what happened? She cut off his
[1:36:03] hair, which was his Nazarite
[1:36:05] vow. Oh my. He promised God not to do
[1:36:09] it, not to cut it. And and he she cut it
[1:36:11] off. And when she did, he'd become like
[1:36:13] any other man. But it's so sad. I've
[1:36:16] always thought this was the most pitiful
[1:36:18] scripture in Judges
[1:36:21] 16:20. When Delilah said, "The
[1:36:23] Philistines be upon thee, Samson." And
[1:36:26] he awoke out of his sleep and said, "I
[1:36:29] will go out as at other times
[1:36:31] before and shake
[1:36:35] myself. I'll shake myself.
[1:36:38] Before he shook off the the the the
[1:36:41] ropes, he he picked up the gates.
[1:36:45] He was able to do it. But one
[1:36:47] day, church, the desert got dry
[1:36:52] and he thought, "It's just like it was
[1:36:57] he whised not." In other words, he
[1:36:59] didn't even know that the Lord was
[1:37:03] departed from him.
[1:37:06] He had he was the same size he always
[1:37:08] was.
[1:37:10] Oh church, you realize the danger for a
[1:37:12] church, maybe even grow in number, look
[1:37:16] good, have all the trappings, but I'm
[1:37:19] not here for the trappings.
[1:37:21] I want to see a move of God. Amen.
[1:37:26] And we get so busy, and I confess to you
[1:37:28] as your pastor, that I get so busy,
[1:37:30] brother Ruth, sometimes just dealing
[1:37:31] with things and and making sure
[1:37:32] everybody's happy, trying to keep
[1:37:34] everybody happy. But is the Lord happy?
[1:37:38] Is he happy with what we're doing? Well,
[1:37:40] that's what we want. We want him to
[1:37:42] honor us with it, with his presence. We
[1:37:44] want to take advantage of those moments
[1:37:46] when we feel the presence of God. And
[1:37:48] when the sanctuary is being moved, we
[1:37:50] want to take advantage of that moment.
[1:37:53] So many times we're so busy,
[1:37:55] we just rush from the sanctuary
[1:38:00] and we just kind of go fall right back
[1:38:02] into our old life. That's what Samson
[1:38:03] did. Right? He said, "I can come back. I
[1:38:07] can shake myself again. It won't hurt. I
[1:38:09] I just missed these few service. It'll
[1:38:10] be okay. It'll be okay. I'm I'm not
[1:38:13] condemning you this morning, church. I'm
[1:38:15] just This is the way it happens to all
[1:38:16] of us. I'll just not read my Bible. I'm
[1:38:19] so busy. I I'll just quit praying. I'm
[1:38:22] so busy." Then one day, you fall off a
[1:38:25] cliff. And you wonder, young people, how
[1:38:27] did I fall off the cliff? That's right.
[1:38:30] Started back here. That's right. like
[1:38:34] running down an incline. You realize
[1:38:35] there's a point of no return. Especially
[1:38:36] when you're my
[1:38:39] size, you get to run the left down an
[1:38:42] incline, there comes a point of no
[1:38:44] return. Gravity is going to take over,
[1:38:49] right? You go going fast enough and you
[1:38:51] think, I've always been able to stop
[1:38:53] before, but there is a point
[1:38:56] at which you fall off. Yeah. And then
[1:38:59] you find yourself with a life broken and
[1:39:01] hurt,
[1:39:03] doing things you never thought you would
[1:39:04] do. That's right. How did I get there?
[1:39:06] How did the desert get
[1:39:09] dry? I just kept running. I just kept
[1:39:12] working. Just kept doing. Just kept
[1:39:15] pleasing the flesh and eventually I fell
[1:39:19] off. I know we don't like to hear these
[1:39:21] things, but it's just it's something I
[1:39:23] have to preach.
[1:39:25] I got to preach it for me. You got to
[1:39:27] preach it for my children, for my wife,
[1:39:29] for you. Amen.
[1:39:32] See, if we continue to treat the things
[1:39:34] of God carelessly, thinking we can pick
[1:39:36] them back up at any time, eventually we
[1:39:39] won't want to.
[1:39:44] What can we do about it, Brother Ben? I
[1:39:46] know all of us, I myself, I'm convicted
[1:39:48] this morning. I I want the water in my
[1:39:50] life. What can we do about it? Well, we
[1:39:52] got to be planted by the rivers of
[1:39:54] water. Amen. First of all, that he has
[1:39:56] to do that. He's done that for us. There
[1:39:59] is a river. Amen. There is water. It's
[1:40:02] available. It's here. We just got to
[1:40:05] grab a hold of it. We got to be planted
[1:40:08] by the rivers of water. We got to come
[1:40:10] to him and drink. Jeremiah 17:5, "Thus
[1:40:13] sayith the Lord, cursed be the man that
[1:40:14] trustth in man, maketh flesh his arm,
[1:40:17] and whose heart departeth from the Lord.
[1:40:22] for he shall be like the heath in the
[1:40:24] desert. The heath is the juniper tree or
[1:40:28] the acacia bush. It's a a heath is is a
[1:40:31] a tree that lives in desert conditions.
[1:40:35] It's that stickery thorny tree that only
[1:40:39] provides so much shade and only can give
[1:40:42] so much fruit. It says the heath in the
[1:40:45] desert shall not see when good cometh.
[1:40:48] It's so dry that even if it got rain, it
[1:40:52] would keep its stickers.
[1:40:55] Why? Because it trusted in the in in the
[1:40:57] arm of flesh. Its heart departed from
[1:41:00] the Lord. Shall not see when good
[1:41:02] cometh, but shall inhabit the parched
[1:41:04] places, the desert, in the wilderness,
[1:41:07] in a salt land, and not inhabited.
[1:41:10] But blessed is the man that trusteth in
[1:41:13] the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.
[1:41:16] For he shall be as a tree planted by the
[1:41:19] waters, and that spreadth out her roots
[1:41:21] by the river. God help me to be like
[1:41:22] that. Plant me in that place, Lord, that
[1:41:26] that shall not see when heat cometh, but
[1:41:28] her leaf shall be green, and shall not
[1:41:29] be careful, shall not be careful,
[1:41:32] doesn't roll up and get tight in the
[1:41:34] year of drought, neither shall cease
[1:41:36] from yielding fruit.
[1:41:38] Oh my. What did Jesus say when when he
[1:41:42] stood up there that great day of the
[1:41:43] feast? He said, "He that believeth on
[1:41:45] me, as the scripture said, out of his
[1:41:47] belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:41:49] water."
[1:41:51] Hallelujah. The prophet said, David
[1:41:54] said, "He'll be like a tree that's
[1:41:55] planted by the rivers of water. Grant
[1:41:56] Lord, that the waters of life will water
[1:41:58] this bride tree in the last days where
[1:42:00] all the denominational branches have
[1:42:02] been pruned by the husband man. And now
[1:42:04] the spirit of God is living a new in the
[1:42:06] top of the tree which come from the
[1:42:08] heart of the tree. Brother Brandham
[1:42:10] taught us that the bride tree was cut
[1:42:11] down and cut back and pruned back until
[1:42:14] all that was left was the heart of it.
[1:42:17] But the
[1:42:18] heart is where the fruit comes from.
[1:42:21] That's where the life is. Yeah. Oh my.
[1:42:25] He said and that's what come the heart
[1:42:27] of the tree is the word. That's what we
[1:42:29] got to do. Make the word preeminent. Get
[1:42:31] it back. We don't we don't have gifts
[1:42:34] for the sake of gifts. We don't worship
[1:42:35] just for the sake of doing it. But we
[1:42:37] believe that the word is true. We're
[1:42:40] doing it because the heart is the
[1:42:43] word. What did the husbandman do? Come
[1:42:46] by and pruned it. See, it brought forth
[1:42:48] denominational fruit. Laid lemons on an
[1:42:49] orange tree. He pruned it off. Brought
[1:42:52] it forth. Kept up. But where's the heart
[1:42:53] of the tree? Right in the middle. He's
[1:42:55] pruned them all down till right in the
[1:42:57] top. He's got a seed down there in the
[1:42:59] root. Like a tree that's been planted by
[1:43:02] the rivers of water. He that takes God's
[1:43:04] love and laws and love in his heart. And
[1:43:06] where does the fruit ripen at quickly?
[1:43:08] In top of the tree. That's where we're
[1:43:11] at, church. Why are the lights on it?
[1:43:14] Amen. That's right. Right in the top of
[1:43:15] the tree. In this last day, he's
[1:43:17] bringing forth a bride tree. David said,
[1:43:20] "Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:43:22] the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
[1:43:24] in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the
[1:43:26] seat of the scornful." What does he do?
[1:43:28] He's removed himself from the desert. He
[1:43:30] said, "But his delight is in the law of
[1:43:32] the Lord, and in his law, he does
[1:43:33] meditate day and night. He shall be like
[1:43:36] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[1:43:38] that bringeth forth his fruit in the
[1:43:40] season. His leaf also shall not wither.
[1:43:42] Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." This
[1:43:44] is a promise for our day. As there was a
[1:43:47] bridegroom tree, there is to be a
[1:43:48] restored bride tree. So you say,
[1:43:50] "Brother Ben, what can we do about it?"
[1:43:52] This is the hour when the fruits are
[1:43:54] supposed to be there. So we have a
[1:43:56] promise of rain. Listen what he says in
[1:43:59] Zechariah 10 and verse one. Ask ye,
[1:44:01] someone say it with me. Ask ye of the
[1:44:04] Lord rain in the time of the latter
[1:44:06] rain. So the Lord shall make bright
[1:44:08] clouds and give them showers of rain to
[1:44:11] everyone grass in the field. Jesus said
[1:44:14] in Matthew 7:7, "Ask and it shall be
[1:44:16] given you. Seek and you shall find.
[1:44:18] Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
[1:44:21] Do you want rain this morning? Ask him
[1:44:23] for it.
[1:44:28] I'm closing in just a moment. Caleb's
[1:44:29] daughter. I've told you this story
[1:44:31] before, but it just fits
[1:44:33] here. It was his daughter Axa who was
[1:44:38] had a little bit of her father's DNA in
[1:44:40] her. Remember Caleb asked for his
[1:44:42] mountain. He said, "Give me my
[1:44:44] mountain." And out of his inheritance,
[1:44:47] he gives his daughter an inheritance. I
[1:44:49] love it because he didn't just give his
[1:44:50] sons an inheritance, but his daughter. I
[1:44:52] believe she was a type of the
[1:44:54] bride. And she a as she asked him and
[1:44:58] and he gave her her inheritance and she
[1:45:00] discovered that her inheritance was a
[1:45:03] dry land. In fact, he told her it was in
[1:45:05] the south. It was in the Ngev desert and
[1:45:10] and you know so many of us if we find
[1:45:12] that we were in difficult places, we
[1:45:14] find we're in a trial. We're talking
[1:45:15] maybe a little bit more about that this
[1:45:16] afternoon, but we find ourselves in a
[1:45:18] desert financially or desert uh
[1:45:21] naturally. We think, well, it's just got
[1:45:23] to be that way. So, since I'm in a
[1:45:25] desert naturally, I'll be in a desert
[1:45:27] spiritually. But that's not actually the
[1:45:29] case.
[1:45:31] Are are you with me? You don't have to
[1:45:33] be in a spiritual desert because you're
[1:45:35] in a dry place in your life.
[1:45:38] Right now, look, what did she say?
[1:45:40] Judges 1:15, the Bible says she got down
[1:45:42] off of the donkey she was riding and she
[1:45:44] said unto him, "Give me a blessing."
[1:45:47] She'd already gotten her inheritance,
[1:45:49] but now she wanted a blessing. Listen to
[1:45:51] me, church. The the inheritance is ours.
[1:45:53] It's predestined to us. But I want a
[1:45:56] blessing on my inheritance. I want
[1:45:58] everything that God has for me. I don't
[1:46:00] want to be just a dried up stump. I
[1:46:02] don't want to be like a heath in the
[1:46:03] desert. I want to be like a tree that's
[1:46:05] planted by the rivers of water. And she
[1:46:07] said to him, "Give me a blessing. For
[1:46:09] thou hast given me a dry land, a south
[1:46:11] land, give me also springs of water. If
[1:46:14] I must have a dry land, if I must live
[1:46:16] in Leona, I need the presence of God
[1:46:19] like never before. I need the spirit
[1:46:21] flowing through my life. I need the word
[1:46:23] of God to be preeminent in my life." So
[1:46:26] she asked her, "Father, give me also
[1:46:29] springs of water." She said, "You've
[1:46:31] given me You've given me a dry place.
[1:46:33] You've given me a church." Maybe some of
[1:46:36] you have been dealt a bad hand or you
[1:46:37] think that it's a hard time or it's a
[1:46:39] difficult place that you're living in.
[1:46:40] But you can cry out to God and say,
[1:46:42] "God, I know I'm going through a trial.
[1:46:44] I know the lot that you've given to me
[1:46:46] is hard, but give me also springs of
[1:46:48] water. If I have your presence, I can
[1:46:50] bear the trial. If I have your presence,
[1:46:52] I can go anywhere, do
[1:46:55] anything. Give you've given me a desert
[1:46:59] land. Give me springs." And Caleb gave
[1:47:03] her upper springs for mountaintop
[1:47:06] experiences, nether springs or lower
[1:47:09] springs for those dry times, for those
[1:47:13] desert
[1:47:14] places. I live in Leodysa, but give me
[1:47:17] springs.
[1:47:18] Plant me by the
[1:47:20] rivers of water.
[1:47:23] musicians as you
[1:47:28] come. You know, the Sea of Galilee has
[1:47:30] three markers to let folks know how full
[1:47:33] the lake
[1:47:35] is. There's an upper red line where the
[1:47:39] flood
[1:47:40] begins. There's a lower red line which
[1:47:44] is 699 ft below sea level. As the Sea of
[1:47:48] Galilee is, I believe, the second lowest
[1:47:50] lake on earth. The lowest is the Dead
[1:47:54] Sea and where pumping should stop. In
[1:47:56] other words, they quit taking water out
[1:47:58] of
[1:47:59] it. The black line is at 703
[1:48:06] ft. I didn't notice this till just now,
[1:48:08] but think about it. The difference is
[1:48:11] only 4
[1:48:14] ft between the lower red line where they
[1:48:19] should stop pumping and the black line
[1:48:21] where irreversible
[1:48:24] damage
[1:48:27] occurs. So they try to keep it up to
[1:48:30] that line. Now that black line was
[1:48:32] reached in November
[1:48:35] 2001 and for
[1:48:37] years the lake remained desperately low
[1:48:41] and they tried all sorts of government
[1:48:43] programs. They quit pumping water out.
[1:48:45] They started desalinating their water,
[1:48:47] taking water and pouring it by hundreds
[1:48:49] and thousands and millions of gallons
[1:48:52] into the Sea of Galilee because it's so
[1:48:55] important to the land of
[1:48:57] Israel. And they couldn't make up the
[1:48:59] difference. They couldn't get it back up
[1:49:01] to where it ought to
[1:49:03] be. Oh, and I'm here to tell you this
[1:49:05] morning, by our own efforts, by by our
[1:49:07] worldly program, we're never going to
[1:49:09] get it back where it ought to
[1:49:12] be. You can have all the program in the
[1:49:14] world for the young people, it's never
[1:49:16] going to give them a desire for God in
[1:49:17] their heart. You can have all the
[1:49:19] program for every age and all the things
[1:49:21] that for people to do and the best
[1:49:24] singing and the best music and
[1:49:25] everything else, it'll never give them
[1:49:26] that desire in their heart. But there's
[1:49:29] got to be something real on the
[1:49:31] inside. All they needed was
[1:49:34] rain. And in one day in 2019, some of
[1:49:38] you all probably saw the news stories.
[1:49:40] In 2019, a miracle happened. They
[1:49:42] thought they'd never cuz of climate
[1:49:44] change and things like that. They
[1:49:45] thought they'd never see the Sea of
[1:49:47] Galilee full again. There were places
[1:49:49] that Jesus walked that we'd never see it
[1:49:52] like he saw it again because they said
[1:49:55] the water had gone down so much that
[1:49:57] irreversible damage occurred. And they
[1:50:00] tried all these programs but one day it
[1:50:02] started raining and and the first day it
[1:50:05] didn't stop and the second day it didn't
[1:50:07] stop and the third day it didn't stop.
[1:50:08] It rained for about a
[1:50:10] year and when it quit raining the water
[1:50:14] was all the way back.
[1:50:18] It was a miracle and nothing else could
[1:50:21] change it but the rain. I'm going to ask
[1:50:23] you this morning, where is your water
[1:50:25] at? Where is your spiritual spirituality
[1:50:29] this morning? Where's the desire of your
[1:50:31] heart? Is it at the black
[1:50:33] level? Is it at the middle level? Is it
[1:50:36] up the upper level? If it's anything
[1:50:38] below the
[1:50:41] top, we need to be asking for
[1:50:44] rain. Take a good appraisal today. Is
[1:50:46] there a desire for the things of God or
[1:50:49] could I just take it or leave
[1:50:51] it? And I hear people say, "Well, I
[1:50:54] could make this decision or that
[1:50:55] decision." And I'm thinking in my heart,
[1:50:57] that decision would take you out of
[1:50:59] church for the rest of your life. You
[1:51:02] wouldn't be able to come. Are you okay
[1:51:03] with that? You need
[1:51:07] rain. You need rain. People start
[1:51:10] complaining about every little thing.
[1:51:12] What do we need? Rain.
[1:51:15] We can try to make people happy in
[1:51:16] whatever way and I want to do that
[1:51:18] church, but let's have
[1:51:20] rain when everything else fails. Let the
[1:51:22] rain fall. Let it fall on our children,
[1:51:25] our young people. Let it fall on
[1:51:27] visitors. Let it fall on people that
[1:51:29] come by. Let it fall. Let it be a place
[1:51:31] that the weary traveler can stop by and
[1:51:33] feel the presence of God is still there
[1:51:35] and the people still care about the
[1:51:37] house of God. There's still a desire to
[1:51:39] go to church. There's a desire to
[1:51:41] worship.
[1:51:43] Oh, let us be that. Today, I'm asking
[1:51:46] you, where's your marker at? If your
[1:51:48] marker is anywhere from the top, then
[1:51:50] your place is at the
[1:51:53] altar. Your place, whether you come here
[1:51:56] or make your seat an altar, your place
[1:51:58] is at the
[1:51:59] altar. Say, Lord, I'm asking you for
[1:52:03] rain so my lake can be
[1:52:06] full. So I don't become all twisted and
[1:52:09] dried. so I don't start doing things
[1:52:12] that I wouldn't used to have
[1:52:14] done. Let me be full of your
[1:52:18] presence.
[1:52:19] Hallelujah. We bow our heads
[1:52:22] together and just feel his presence this
[1:52:27] morning. Let me be full.
[1:52:30] Lord, we're going to have a baptism
[1:52:32] service in the morning. A beginning. We
[1:52:34] see a little shoot springing up.
[1:52:37] beginning for a young
[1:52:40] man. Maybe others would like to be
[1:52:42] baptized. The water will be there for
[1:52:44] you. But but we see just a beginning
[1:52:47] getting
[1:52:48] started. But oh that the rain would
[1:52:51] come. Water that
[1:52:55] seed. Water that seed
[1:52:59] until until we could
[1:53:02] know till we could know that he were he
[1:53:05] was cared for by God. that we were cared
[1:53:07] for by God. Heavenly
[1:53:11] Father, I'm asking you this morning, we
[1:53:15] got another service today. We got a
[1:53:17] baptism of Lord, I'm asking you right
[1:53:19] now, Lord, send the
[1:53:24] rain. May your presence soften up my
[1:53:27] ground, oh God. May it change the
[1:53:30] atmosphere in my life.
[1:53:33] Oh, I don't want it just to be a camp
[1:53:34] experience, Lord, or just a revival
[1:53:36] experience. Let it be every day, God.
[1:53:39] Let me ask every day, Lord, soften me
[1:53:45] up. Well, no matter what position I hold
[1:53:47] in the church, I want to be tender. I
[1:53:49] want to be
[1:53:50] soft. I don't want to be turned into a
[1:53:53] desert. I don't want to
[1:53:57] drift. Change me, oh God.
[1:54:01] know my
[1:54:02] heart. Move me from a place of dryness
[1:54:06] to a place, Lord, where the ground is
[1:54:09] fertile, where the trees grow and the
[1:54:11] birds sing, where there's love and joy
[1:54:14] and peace and gentleness and
[1:54:16] longsuffering. I pray you'd grant it
[1:54:18] today. Lord, I thank you for these
[1:54:20] people who have listened patiently this
[1:54:21] morning. I pray you'd bless them,
[1:54:23] strengthen them, oh God, we pray in
[1:54:26] Jesus name.
[1:54:30] Hallelujah. Get out. If you need prayer,
[1:54:32] the altar's open. Pour your spirit
[1:54:37] out.
[1:54:39] Oh, just like the
[1:54:42] [Music]
[1:54:44] rain.
[1:54:46] Saturate my thirsty soul. Oh, love.
[1:54:53] Lord, I want to be saturated
[1:54:55] again till I've got something to give.
[1:54:59] Oh,
[1:55:00] Lord. Oh, heal my heart. Oh, and make me
[1:55:06] home.
[1:55:08] Hallelujah. Oh, Lord, I need
[1:55:13] you. Pour your
[1:55:16] spirit out. Just make it your prayer.
[1:55:19] Just where you're at. Oh, pour your
[1:55:22] spirit out on me. Oh, fall just like the
[1:55:28] rain. Oh,
[1:55:33] sate thirsty soul. Are you thirsty this
[1:55:37] morning? Come and fall aresh on me. Why
[1:55:41] don't you fill my cup
[1:55:46] again? Oh, heal my
[1:55:49] heart and make me whole. Lord, I need
[1:55:54] you. I need you right now, Lord. Lord, I
[1:55:57] need you
[1:55:59] now. Pull your
[1:56:02] spirit out. Sing. Do we know the verses
[1:56:05] to that? Lord, I seek
[1:56:07] you. Lord, I seek
[1:56:11] you. Help me find you. Oh yeah. How I
[1:56:18] need your touch.
[1:56:21] Find my dry and broken places. Oh, find
[1:56:25] my dry
[1:56:28] and broken places. Oh God, thirsty for
[1:56:35] your love is where it starts. Church,
[1:56:38] let's just take a moment. I know we we
[1:56:40] got some time. Let's just take a moment.
[1:56:42] Lord, forgive me. Oh, if I wondered. Oh,
[1:56:49] Lord, far away from you. You are all
[1:56:55] I've ever needed. Come on, church. You
[1:56:58] are all
[1:57:00] I ever
[1:57:03] needed. Oh yes. Come and make me new.
[1:57:10] Oh, pour your spirit.
[1:57:16] me. Oh, just like the
[1:57:21] rain
[1:57:28] [Music]

[1:57:50] you for your
[1:57:56] spirit. Lord, I seek
[1:57:58] you. Lord, I seek
[1:58:02] you. Help me find you.
[1:58:08] How I need your
[1:58:15] touch. Find my dry
[1:58:19] and broken
[1:58:23] places thirsty for your
[1:58:29] love. Oh Lord, forgive me. Oh, church,
[1:58:35] maybe there's you like to just stand and
[1:58:37] say, "Lord, I need I need that I need
[1:58:39] that praying, Lord. I need that water.
[1:58:43] Oh, God. I need you to move, Lord. I

[1:58:51] I've ever
[1:58:54] needed. Hallelujah. Oh, come and make me
[1:58:59] new. Oh, come on, church. Oh, pour your

[1:59:41] now. Have
[1:59:44] mercy. I

[1:59:54] you this morning.
[1:59:57] Now I
[1:59:59] need your
[2:00:04] time. Find my
[2:00:08] drive for broken
[2:00:13] places, thirsting for your love.
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:22] Lord forgive
[2:00:25] me if I
[2:00:29] want far away from
[2:00:34] [Music]

[2:01:00] rain saturate. Oh,

[2:01:18] cup my
[2:01:20] heart and make me
[2:01:25] home? Oh Lord, I need you
[2:01:30] now for your
[2:01:33] sweet. I just want us to
[2:01:37] church. We get so bound up and stickered
[2:01:40] up.
[2:01:42] We're afraid what somebody thinks of
[2:01:47] us. Some of you I I've I've pastored for
[2:01:49] years. Sister Fritz has been our friend.
[2:01:52] And but we all get
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:56] dry. We all get
[2:02:00] dry. If there ever was a
[2:02:03] saint, Sister Fritz, but we all get dry.
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:09] And if if a saint of God could need and
[2:02:12] feel the need for a baptism of the Holy
[2:02:15] Ghost for a refilling of the Holy Ghost,
[2:02:18] what about you and I this
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:23] morning? You know, people need it more
[2:02:25] than you know that you do. You need his
[2:02:27] presence. I'm going to let you go, but I
[2:02:30] want you to hold this. Hold this in your
[2:02:34] heart. Let's not leave his presence when
[2:02:37] we go out of here. Let's let's be gentle
[2:02:39] and kind to one another and treat one
[2:02:40] another right. Not not not leave his
[2:02:43] presence. When we come back in this
[2:02:46] afternoon, we're going to preach again.
[2:02:48] We're going to have church again. It be
[2:02:49] another opportunity. Maybe you didn't
[2:02:51] break loose this morning. But you say,
[2:02:52] "Lord, I know I need
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:56] it." There'll be
[2:02:59] water. Come everyone that is thirsty. He
[2:03:01] said, "Come unto me." What is he? He is
[2:03:04] the word. The word is being preached.
[2:03:06] There's water for
[2:03:08] you.
[2:03:10] Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads
[2:03:13] together. Heavenly Father, as we go to
[2:03:15] the baptismal
[2:03:17] service, Lord, I pray that you would
[2:03:20] just move, Lord, in the heart of a young
[2:03:22] man, oh God, that wants to be right,
[2:03:26] wants to be saved. I pray that you'd
[2:03:28] fill him with the Holy Ghost. Lord, I
[2:03:31] pray for each one of us, God. When we
[2:03:34] gather back, Lord, in this place, may
[2:03:35] this spirit not leave us. May we think
[2:03:38] about these
[2:03:39] things, Lord. We don't want the things
[2:03:42] of God to get old to us. We want your
[2:03:45] presence. Pour your spirit out, oh
[2:03:48] God. Grant it, Lord. May it keep falling
[2:03:51] through the day. Our reservoir get
[2:03:53] filled up until this afternoon. is not
[2:03:55] just another service, but there's a
[2:03:58] hunger in our heart to be in the house
[2:04:00] of God. Grant it, Lord, we
[2:04:04] pray. Hallelujah. What I'm going to have
[2:04:06] you do is is go right out that back door
[2:04:09] and right directly if you would refrain
[2:04:10] from shaking hands till after and we'll
[2:04:12] just go ahead and be dismissed after the
[2:04:14] baptism service. God bless you. If you
[2:04:16] need to go home, God bless you. We're
[2:04:18] going to the baptism. Thirsty soul.
[2:04:21] Hallelujah. coming forth fresh on me.
[2:04:25] Oh, fill my cup again. Oh, gravity,
[2:04:30] Lord. Oh, heal my
[2:04:33] heart and make me whole. Thank you,
[2:04:38] Lord. Lord, I need you
[2:04:43] now for your spirit.
