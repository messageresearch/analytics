[45:10] I can just see it on your faces praise
[45:11] the Lord Hebrews chapter 12 and verse
[45:13] one wherefore seeing we also are
[45:16] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[45:18] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[45:22] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[45:24] us and let us run with patience the race
[45:27] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[45:31] the author and finisher of our faith who
[45:34] for the joy that was set before him
[45:36] endured the cross despising the shame
[45:39] and is set down at the right hand of the
[45:42] Throne of God and in John chapter 4 very
[45:46] familiar reading John Chapter 4:
[45:48] 2 John
[45:51] 4:25 this is Jesus uh talking at to the
[45:54] woman at the well brother Brandon
[45:55] references this many many
[45:59] times and when I had this thought this
[46:01] evening come to me or yesterday when it
[46:03] came to me I was thinking uh I was
[46:05] thinking about this and what was she
[46:06] looking for when he
[46:08] appeared and Jesus would say it like
[46:11] this or the woman would say it like this
[46:12] the woman saith unto him I know that
[46:14] Messiah cometh which is called Christ
[46:16] when he is come he will tell us all
[46:18] things Jesus saith unto her I that speak
[46:21] unto thee am he and upon this came his
[46:24] disciples and marveled that he talked
[46:25] with the woman yet no man said what
[46:28] seekest thou or why talkest thou with
[46:30] her the woman then left her water pot
[46:32] and went her way into the City and saith
[46:35] to the men come see a man which told me
[46:38] all the things that ever I did is not
[46:42] this the Christ and if I could title
[46:45] this this evening what are you looking
[46:47] for you may be
[46:50] seated or what are you looking at what
[46:52] are you looking to every one of us are
[46:54] looking uh for something every one of us
[46:57] every one of us are looking at something
[46:59] if you're looking up here right now
[47:00] you're not looking at much but uh you
[47:02] know every every one of us are have we
[47:04] have to be looking at something we have
[47:05] to be looking forward to something and
[47:07] the Bible tells us there that we are uh
[47:09] we are looking unto Jesus the author and
[47:11] finisher of our faith and if if you're
[47:13] looking at anything else I would say
[47:16] that you're looking uh in the wrong way
[47:18] you're looking at the wrong thing
[47:19] because in this day there's going to be
[47:21] distractions in this day there's going
[47:22] to be a lot of voices to distract you
[47:24] there's going to be a lot of uh
[47:26] different preachers there's going to be
[47:27] a lot of different things uh that will
[47:30] man something just happened to these
[47:32] mics I hope that's okay I don't know
[47:34] what happened but I just heard it ring
[47:35] up here real bad so y'all just bear with
[47:38] me I'm not sure what's going on in the
[47:39] back but it's uh it's hot right now so
[47:42] in this age of distractions that was a
[47:45] distraction
[47:46] Hallelujah that was a distraction I
[47:48] heard that thing ring so loud about blew
[47:50] my eardrum out in this age of
[47:53] distractions and so much entertainment
[47:55] you know we forget to keep our eyes is
[47:57] focused on Christ even in Christmas
[47:58] season uh you know we all I love this
[48:01] time of year for family and things like
[48:03] that it is a controversial time of year
[48:05] but you know it also is a time when you
[48:08] can really focus in on the birth of
[48:10] Christ and that's what we're supposed to
[48:12] do uh the world has made it with its
[48:14] tinsil and its glitter and it's about
[48:16] everything but Christ and yet and yet we
[48:18] are looking to what the main reason for
[48:21] Christmas was was not just a baby and a
[48:24] Manger but it was Christ that would come
[48:26] and become one of us can you say Amen so
[48:29] that we could actually uh that that we
[48:31] could actually take on his spirit and we
[48:33] could actually become him so he became
[48:35] us I believe it was brother Donnie that
[48:37] wrote the song he became me so that I
[48:38] could become him aren't you glad he
[48:40] became us aren't you be glad aren't you
[48:42] glad he became simple and humble and and
[48:45] just a baby just something that we could
[48:47] relate with us he was tempted in all
[48:49] like manner as we are but if you're
[48:51] looking to just the flesh you miss uh
[48:54] you miss everything about why he came he
[48:56] didn't come just to live he didn't come
[48:58] just to die but he came so that he could
[49:01] actually send his spirit and actually
[49:03] make a body on earth that could live out
[49:05] and do the very works that he did so we
[49:08] we've got to watch what we're looking
[49:09] for we've got to watch what we're what
[49:11] we're looking at and we don't want to
[49:13] ever get caught up and if you look at
[49:14] the messenger many times you look at the
[49:16] messenger and you forget to look at the
[49:18] message that he brought can you say Amen
[49:20] tonight amen we look at the messenger we
[49:22] think well the messenger did this and
[49:24] the messenger did that and we look at
[49:25] the Flesh of the man and we completely
[49:27] forget to look at what God was sending
[49:30] in our generation we're we're looking at
[49:32] the wrong thing so don't ever get your
[49:33] eyes on a man brother Brandon would say
[49:35] don't look at me but look to the message
[49:37] amen amen we believe that God doesn't
[49:39] doesn't send a a man to uh to to bring
[49:42] the message that wouldn't be worthy to
[49:43] bring it but yet uh many times we're
[49:46] looking at the wrong thing because we're
[49:47] looking at the mistakes of the man or
[49:49] we're looking at the humanity of the man
[49:51] but remember if you're looking at the
[49:52] humanity then even Jesus himself you
[49:54] could say he wasn't Divine because that
[49:56] woman would tell brother brandom said
[49:58] she said I could prove by the scriptures
[49:59] he wasn't Divine when he was Weeping at
[50:01] his friend's grave but brother Brandon
[50:03] would say it like this he said he was a
[50:05] he was a man when he was weeping for his
[50:07] friend but when he pulled them shoulders
[50:09] back and and he called a man that was
[50:10] dead four days from the grave that was
[50:12] more than a man so quit looking at the
[50:15] humanity tonight and start looking at
[50:17] the word when you start looking at the
[50:19] humanity you see faults and you see
[50:21] failures and you see men that can't live
[50:23] nothing listen without him we're nothing
[50:25] without him we can't stand here and
[50:27] preach the gospel without him your
[50:29] marriage is never going to make it
[50:30] without him your children can't be saved
[50:32] but we're looking to Jesus who is the
[50:35] author and the finisher of our faith and
[50:37] then we're not looking for something new
[50:39] in this hour but we're looking to the
[50:40] message that has already come to call
[50:42] out a bride come on Church we're looking
[50:45] to what a message has to the message
[50:47] that has come and that message just to
[50:49] call us and get us ready for something
[50:51] we're not looking to go back to 1963 or
[50:54] back to 1947 we're not looking to go
[50:56] back back and and have a Prophet come
[50:58] and reveal more things to us no it's
[51:00] already been sent it's already been
[51:01] revealed the message has come it's time
[51:04] we look at the message and get ready for
[51:06] the soon appearing of Christ can you say
[51:08] amen Amen brother Brandon would say it
[51:10] like this he said he said look unto me
[51:12] all the ends of the Earth and he was
[51:13] quoting Isaiah 45:22 and he said now
[51:16] when the Earth has come to its end or
[51:17] the system of the Earth has come to its
[51:18] ends let the people look unto him can
[51:21] you say amen and he said now you might
[51:23] say we have heard this generation after
[51:25] generation we've heard this for a long
[51:27] time he said that is true and it's been
[51:28] preached for a long time many ministers
[51:30] has taken this same text and thousands
[51:33] of them but here's the thing I want to
[51:34] ask you tonight for the next few minutes
[51:36] he said when you look the question is
[51:38] what do you see when you look what do
[51:40] you see when you do look he said that
[51:43] only depends on what you're looking for
[51:45] so if you're looking at all the men that
[51:47] have come and all the men that have gone
[51:49] and every all the men that have failed
[51:50] you or all the men that are going to
[51:52] fail you listen all you're going to see
[51:54] is failure but if you're looking to him
[51:56] you're to see a promise of a soon coming
[51:58] amen if you're looking to him you're
[51:59] going to see more than just a man that
[52:01] has failed you if you're looking to him
[52:03] you're going to see more than Humanity
[52:05] that can't even live nothing but what
[52:06] you're going to see is a man standing
[52:08] here tonight who is not here on his own
[52:10] ability but he is here because God has
[52:13] called me to stand here and preach the
[52:15] unsearchable riches of Christ and I'm
[52:17] going to tell you tonight it's not my
[52:18] ability that I can stand here and preach
[52:20] the gospel with but I can stand here and
[52:22] tell you it's all about him amen I'm not
[52:24] don't look to me I'm your brother I can
[52:26] fail you but look to him and he alone is
[52:30] worthy to reveal the word of your heart
[52:32] he alone is worthy of all the praise we
[52:34] can give him he alone is worthy to open
[52:37] the seals in our day he alone was worthy
[52:40] to give you what you listen church I
[52:42] think we need to go ahead and just tell
[52:43] him he's worthy of our praise tonight
[52:45] our young people he's worthy of our
[52:47] praise tonight he's not he's not listen
[52:49] he never failed you and he never will
[52:52] fail you he's never lost the battle so
[52:54] why would he lose one now I just go
[52:56] ahead and tell you we need to look to
[52:58] him all the ends of the Earth because he
[53:00] is coming he's coming back and I believe
[53:03] it with all my heart well the church
[53:04] just needs to get ready listen this
[53:06] morning what you was hearing was not a
[53:08] sermon just a just a just to preach a
[53:10] sermon but he was telling you amen we've
[53:12] got to line up with something in order
[53:13] to be ready for his soon coming amen
[53:15] we've got to hear those messages like
[53:17] that a pastor has to come in here and be
[53:20] a pastor why because those things are to
[53:22] get you ready for the Rapture that is
[53:24] coming are you looking for a rapture
[53:27] then the Rapture is ready for you listen
[53:29] we are to become the Rapture and be in
[53:31] the process of a Rapture and then we
[53:33] will be caught up to meet him right see

[53:39] be ready no we are becoming now Sons and
[53:42] Daughters of God we are now being placed
[53:44] we are now getting ready for a Rapture
[53:46] if you wait till then to get ready for
[53:48] the Rapture the Rapture is going to come
[53:49] and the Rapture is going to pass but I'm
[53:51] looking now for a Rapture I'm looking
[53:53] now for a body change what are you
[53:55] looking for tonight church I'm not
[53:57] looking for a new job or I'm not looking
[53:59] for a bigger church or more members but
[54:01] I'm looking for God to do what he
[54:03] already promised to do well can you say
[54:06] Amen tonight brother Randon would say it

[54:22] going to find faults and mistakes in the
[54:24] message if you're looking for fault F
[54:26] and mistakes in your pastor you're going
[54:28] to find faults and mistakes in your
[54:29] pastor if you're looking for faults and

[54:40] you're looking for somebody if your
[54:42] brother David if you're looking at that
[54:43] person that's not there tonight but
[54:45] whoever would normally sit by you if
[54:46] you're looking for somebody and you
[54:48] start to look at them and you say well
[54:50] that person really needs what the
[54:51] preacher's preaching tonight you know I
[54:53] say what we're doing we're looking at
[54:54] the wrong thing I need I I need what God
[54:57] has for me in this service my my
[54:59] neighbor needs something but but more
[55:01] than anything it's me oh Lord standing
[55:03] in the need of prayer it's me it's not
[55:05] my brother it's not my sister but I need
[55:07] a renewing of my mind I need a renewing
[55:10] in my spirit I need a Revival in my life
[55:13] I need something to get a hold of me to
[55:15] where I can look to him again on and
[55:18] quit looking at the problems in the
[55:19] church or quit looking to the problems
[55:20] of the young people I come on somebody
[55:23] you you you look at all these young
[55:24] people just wait till they're 16 years
[55:26] old old then you can start talking about
[55:27] problems that's right but if you just
[55:29] look at the problems you never see the
[55:31] promise that that young person can
[55:33] become a real Christian that young
[55:35] person can become a preacher's wife or
[55:37] that young man can become a preacher but
[55:39] quit looking at the false and start
[55:41] looking at a promise welome the church
[55:43] say Amen
[55:45] tonight brother B was talking about
[55:47] Elijah he said I still believe God he
[55:49] said I focused in on the word and I know
[55:51] that to be truth nobody has ever been
[55:53] able to shake me from it yet and as long
[55:55] as god holds my heart right straight on
[55:57] that word I'll stay there he said Elijah
[55:59] one day when he was looking for
[56:00] something to come to bring to help the
[56:02] people he looked and he looked till the
[56:03] old man 80s something years old was too
[56:05] tired to climb the mountain and after
[56:07] he' been fasting and praying but God
[56:09] told him if they would repent something
[56:11] would happen what was he looking he sent
[56:13] his servant up and said go up and look
[56:14] look something is going to happen three
[56:16] and a half years yeah and a half three
[56:18] years and a half and no rain not a cloud
[56:20] not even a dew falling but said go look

[56:25] and he looked and he didn't see nothing
[56:26] and he he come back down and he said I
[56:28] didn't see nothing and he goes back up
[56:30] and and he and he looks again and he
[56:32] said I didn't see nothing and Elijah

[56:37] there in the Sun and his whiskers and
[56:39] his beard white beard and them little
[56:41] bony looking arms cross his bony knees
[56:43] and he said Lord God as he began to pray
[56:45] he said go back again now what was he
[56:47] doing he was looking for God to take
[56:49] care of his promise now look look look
[56:52] he didn't he didn't care that there was
[56:53] no rain he didn't care that there was no
[56:55] clouds but he knew that there was a
[56:57] promise of one to come and so he kept
[56:59] sending the servant saying go look again
[57:01] it wasn't in vain why because he knew
[57:04] that it was going to come and so he was
[57:06] go on like this now brother B would go
[57:07] on and he would say now we got different
[57:09] ideas we change it every now and then oh
[57:10] my said everything but don't look at

[58:01] mountain and the first thing you know
[58:02] the whole skies were thundering rain was
[58:05] falling what was it he accepted what God
[58:07] had said now he didn't give up when it
[58:09] looked like it wasn't going to come but
[58:11] the rains are going to fall anyway I say
[58:13] don't give up on our young people when
[58:14] it looks like that God's not dealing
[58:16] with them I believe the rain is going to
[58:18] fall on our young people I believe the
[58:20] rain's going to fall in our church
[58:21] services again I don't think we need to
[58:23] wait on something to happen but I
[58:25] believe we just accept the promise that
[58:27] I will pour out my spirit and I'm here
[58:29] to accept the pouring out of his Spirit
[58:32] I'm here to have a good time in church
[58:34] whether the people want to have a good
[58:35] time with me or not listen let me go and
[58:37] tell you tonight church I'm here because
[58:38] of a promise to come together and he
[58:41] would be in our midst is he here tonight
[58:44] I say if two or three are gathered even
[58:46] if you don't feel him he's here I'm not
[58:48] looking to your feeling I'm looking to
[58:50] his word I'm looking to his promise I'm
[58:52] not looking to how I feel today I may
[58:55] not feel like preaching today but I'm
[58:57] here because he said get in the Pulpit
[58:58] young men and preach this gospel until
[59:01] the coming of the Lord so I'm going to
[59:02] do what a prophet said and you're going
[59:04] to go to church and you're going to hear
[59:06] the preaching of the Gospel why because
[59:08] that's what the prophet said to do look
[59:10] I'm not looking at the circumstances I'm
[59:12] not looking at the people have closed
[59:13] their doors and said we don't need
[59:15] Church no more I'm not looking at people
[59:17] said we don't need preaching no more I'm
[59:18] not looking to that I'm looking to what
[59:20] the word has told me to do I'm looking
[59:22] at the word has called me to do the word
[59:24] has called me to live a little higher
[59:26] than that the word has called me from
[59:28] the chicken pit I was in the word has
[59:30] called me from being a sick a sick bird
[59:32] out there in a chicken pin and he has
[59:35] called me to soar above all the problems
[59:37] that I can see with my eye I'm not going
[59:39] to get down there and associate with all
[59:40] them problems but I'm going to soar into
[59:42] the heavenlies and I'm going to go ahead
[59:44] and say you know what I'm going to pray
[59:45] for that brother that's Fallen instead
[59:47] of get over there like a bunch of
[59:48] chickens and pick on him what can you
[59:50] say Amen tonight I'm going to quit
[59:52] trying to put down my brother when I
[59:53] don't see something like he did I'm
[59:55] going to quit trying to to pick on
[59:57] somebody I'm going to start praying for
[59:59] them why I'm not looking at the
[1:00:00] circumstance I'm looking at the
[1:00:02] potential that that man is a promis Son
[1:00:05] of God I'm looking at the potential that
[1:00:07] that Pastor can be a pastor really on
[1:00:09] fire with God I'm looking at the
[1:00:11] potential that our young men that look
[1:00:12] like they're falling away are not going
[1:00:14] to fall away because they are one of
[1:00:16] God's children I'm looking at our young
[1:00:18] men here tonight and I can tell you with
[1:00:20] full belief and and faith in God that
[1:00:22] these men are not going to fall away but
[1:00:24] these are the Church of tomorrow these
[1:00:26] are the ministers if there's a minister
[1:00:28] tomorrow these are men of God if there's
[1:00:30] a if there's a tomorrow I'm going to goe
[1:00:33] and tell you tonight church we need to
[1:00:34] quit looking at the things that are
[1:00:36] bringing us down and start looking at
[1:00:37] things that are positive brother said
[1:00:39] don't look at these things like this
[1:00:41] always be looking at the positive listen
[1:00:43] I know there's Church problems that'll
[1:00:44] rise I know there's things that'll come
[1:00:46] up in this church I know there's things
[1:00:47] that'll come up in somebody else's
[1:00:48] church and you sure don't need to look
[1:00:50] at them well can you say Amen there's no
[1:00:53] reason for us to look at everybody
[1:00:54] else's problems there's no reason for us
[1:00:56] to look at my BR listen church this is
[1:00:58] just on my heart tonight but we get
[1:01:00] distracted by things that are going on
[1:01:02] around us that have no bearing on what
[1:01:04] but what we need that we don't even need
[1:01:06] to be involved in those situations but
[1:01:08] we get involved because we think that we
[1:01:10] can help them but the only person that
[1:01:12] can help them is Christ himself so I say
[1:01:15] tonight let somebody else over here if
[1:01:17] they're having a problem pray for them
[1:01:18] if they're having a bad day pray for him
[1:01:20] but ask for me in my house we're going
[1:01:22] to go to church and we're going to serve
[1:01:24] the Lord ask for me in my house we're
[1:01:26] not going to be caught up in the world
[1:01:27] of L to see him but we're going to serve
[1:01:29] God why because we're looking to a
[1:01:31] promise of his coming is that all right
[1:01:34] tonight what are we looking for what
[1:01:37] you're looking for is often what you'll
[1:01:39] get if you're looking for something good
[1:01:41] to happen in church something Good's
[1:01:43] going to happen in church come on if
[1:01:46] you're looking for a bad
[1:01:48] service you going have a bad service
[1:01:51] that's right that's true you heard Joel
[1:01:53] was preaching and you're thinking
[1:01:55] tonight it's going to be rough where
[1:01:57] it's going to be long quit thinking like
[1:02:00] that cuz nobody else wants that to
[1:02:02] happen
[1:02:04] either brother Brandon would say it like
[1:02:06] this he said remember you can only see
[1:02:08] him as you look at him through the word
[1:02:11] can the church say Amen you can look at
[1:02:13] him through a textbook or you can't look
[1:02:15] at him through a textbook you can't look
[1:02:17] at him through Creed you will see two or
[1:02:19] three gods and everything else in them
[1:02:21] Creeds but look at him through the word
[1:02:24] come on is that all right he said but
[1:02:26] look at him through the word and you'll
[1:02:28] see that he is Emmanuel God made flesh
[1:02:31] Among Us he said I am God and besides me
[1:02:34] there is none other is that all right
[1:02:36] tonight he is God and when Isaiah looked
[1:02:39] away from the world to see him he said I
[1:02:41] see a counselor a prince of peace the
[1:02:43] Mighty God the Everlasting father that's
[1:02:45] what Isaiah looked away and saw Daniel
[1:02:47] one time was standing there and he saw
[1:02:49] the end of the Gentile kingdoms that he
[1:02:51] saw the image that Nebuchadnezzar had
[1:02:53] dreamed and he saw how each one would
[1:02:54] succeed the other and as they come down
[1:02:57] and when he looked to see what was all
[1:02:58] going to happen at the end when he saw
[1:03:00] Jesus he was a stone hued out of the
[1:03:02] mountain without hands and that crushed
[1:03:04] the Gentile kingdoms Nebuchadnezzar
[1:03:05] throw three Hebrew children in the fiery
[1:03:07] furnace that believed in God and stood
[1:03:09] on his word and if they had to die forth
[1:03:11] they was going to stand anyhow and just
[1:03:13] a little thing of bowing their knees
[1:03:14] some other way but when he looked away
[1:03:16] and saw Jesus he was the fourth man that
[1:03:19] was in the fiery furnace and it kept all
[1:03:21] the heat off of his obedient servants oh
[1:03:23] sometimes we just need to look and he's
[1:03:25] right there amen we just need to look at
[1:03:28] Jesus and realize he's not that far away
[1:03:30] he's just as close as your right arm to
[1:03:32] you amen he's not just a Jesus that was
[1:03:34] with brother Brandon he's not just a
[1:03:36] Jesus that walked the shores of Galilee
[1:03:38] he's not just the Jesus that was in a
[1:03:40] Manger he's not just a Jesus that hung
[1:03:42] on the cross come on church but he's a
[1:03:44] Jesus that is here and he's living among
[1:03:47] us and he's dwelling inside of us and
[1:03:49] he's making you to act like sons of God
[1:03:51] and he's making you quit your lying and
[1:03:53] quit your stealing anden it's God and we
[1:03:55] need to start looking at him that is
[1:03:57] coming our day anden it wasn't a man
[1:04:00] that came in our day but it was Christ
[1:04:01] the word that came in our day so that we
[1:04:04] can become the very Sons and Daughters
[1:04:06] of God Amen it's the word living in us
[1:04:08] can you say Amen it's the word brother R
[1:04:11] would say Ezekiel Saw A Wheel in the
[1:04:12] middle of the wheel way up in the middle
[1:04:14] of the air he was the Hub to the wheel
[1:04:16] where where where every spoke is
[1:04:17] fastened to amen every spoke is fastened
[1:04:20] to the hub amen amen without that then
[1:04:23] it's a broken it's a Broken Spoke amen
[1:04:25] amen but if the spoke is connected to
[1:04:27] the hub then there's power there there's
[1:04:29] Authority there amen but if one of them
[1:04:31] spokes is out of alignment if one of
[1:04:33] them spokes is broken then there that
[1:04:35] that wheel is going to get all off
[1:04:36] balance and that's why you see people
[1:04:38] doing this and and and start teaching
[1:04:40] things around this time of the year and
[1:04:41] they have no balance to it what is it
[1:04:43] it's because they have got a spoke in
[1:04:45] the wheel that's been loosed but
[1:04:47] everything is tied to him every spoke is
[1:04:49] connected to him everything we teach is
[1:04:51] connected to the hub amen everything he
[1:04:53] is the wheel in the middle of the will
[1:04:56] he is the Hub that holds everything
[1:04:58] together amen listen church it's not my
[1:05:00] idea that's going to help you it's not
[1:05:02] brother Ben's idea that's going to help
[1:05:04] you but it is the word that is bringing
[1:05:06] everything into balance everything into
[1:05:08] focus it is not just a balance that you
[1:05:10] want to see am me a balance that you
[1:05:12] think brother brandom taught amen but it
[1:05:14] is a balance will because he is the
[1:05:17] center of that thing and if you're
[1:05:19] connected to him then nothing's going to
[1:05:21] shake you nothing can make you lose
[1:05:24] nothing can take you out why because
[1:05:26] you're connected to the whe in the
[1:05:28] middle of the wheel than I wish I could
[1:05:30] have preached on that I if I have
[1:05:32] thought of it I'd have had a sermon on
[1:05:33] that tonight amen he's the wheel in the
[1:05:34] middle of the wheel is that all right
[1:05:36] Amen brother bandom said the big wheel
[1:05:39] run by faith but the Little Wheel turned
[1:05:40] by the power of the Lord oh thank you
[1:05:43] Lord look he said that's who Ezekiel Saw
[1:05:45] when he looked away sir he man think
[1:05:46] about Noah's day when the people looked
[1:05:49] they saw a crazy old fanatic amen when
[1:05:52] the people looked what did they see this
[1:05:54] man is out here building a boat and it
[1:05:56] might be 100° and sunshine and not a
[1:05:58] single cloud in the sky but he's
[1:06:00] building it why because God said so am
[1:06:03] man he was connected to the wheel in the
[1:06:05] middle of the wheel you see what I'm
[1:06:06] saying tonight amen he wasn't worried
[1:06:08] about what the people said he was
[1:06:10] worried about what God said because God
[1:06:12] said he's going to get on that boat and
[1:06:14] be delivered amen and so we're not
[1:06:16] looking at what the world laughs at and
[1:06:18] says well you don't need to have that
[1:06:19] long hair you don't need to wear dresses
[1:06:21] or you don't need to quit your cussing
[1:06:23] or quit your smoking amen that's what
[1:06:25] the world tell you but what did God say
[1:06:27] about the situation man what did God
[1:06:29] tell you to do in this day are you
[1:06:31] connected to that word and that word is
[1:06:33] making you live out amen the revelation
[1:06:35] of this day well is that all right
[1:06:37] tonight amen we're looking at the we
[1:06:39] look at the children of Israel when they
[1:06:40] saw the Red Sea amen what did they see
[1:06:42] they saw death and destruction amen they
[1:06:44] saw Pharaoh's Army closing in they were
[1:06:46] looking at that but when when when Moses
[1:06:48] looked and saw that Pillar of Fire amen
[1:06:50] he looked at something greater than what
[1:06:52] they saw amen I see destruction but the
[1:06:54] bride doesn't see see destruction amen
[1:06:56] the bride is looking and she sees a
[1:06:59] Rapture what can you say Amen tonight
[1:07:01] church amen I I I tell you we need to
[1:07:03] quit looking at the Doom and Gloom we
[1:07:05] need to quit looking at who's going down
[1:07:07] and destruction and start looking at the
[1:07:09] bride that's going up amen we need to
[1:07:11] start looking and say you know what it
[1:07:12] don't matter it don't matter about this
[1:07:14] world because this world's going down
[1:07:16] anyway amen but I'm not going to stay
[1:07:18] here I'm not going to be here when this
[1:07:20] world is blown to Pieces I'm not going
[1:07:21] to be here when it turns to ashes but
[1:07:23] I'm going to go up with a bride because
[1:07:25] I'm looking for a Rapture and what are
[1:07:27] you looking for tonight church are you
[1:07:29] looking for a Rapture then there's a
[1:07:31] Rapture Ready for you anden there's a
[1:07:33] Rapture awaiting you to get ready for
[1:07:35] that Rapture amen I believe if if the
[1:07:37] bride knew who she was tonight we'd be
[1:07:39] in that Rapture right look can you say
[1:07:41] man that's what a prophet said if the
[1:07:43] bride could ever realize who she is if
[1:07:45] the bride could ever recognize who she
[1:07:47] is we'd be out of this place come on is
[1:07:50] that all right tonight so what are we
[1:07:51] looking for we're looking at the
[1:07:53] problems of the world we're looking at
[1:07:54] does this church do it or does that
[1:07:56] Pastor preach it or does this one do it
[1:07:57] listen church that that that has no
[1:07:59] bearing on me amen that has no bearing
[1:08:01] on my salvation amen I don't care what
[1:08:04] they do in that church but I'm worried
[1:08:05] about me and can I get ready I I we all
[1:08:08] get caught up in those things we all get
[1:08:10] caught up by looking at the other church
[1:08:11] and we all get caught up looking across
[1:08:12] the fence but who do we really need to
[1:08:14] be looking at I need to be looking at my
[1:08:16] life and seeing if it's lining up with
[1:08:18] his word amen because his word is what
[1:08:20] matters his voice is what matters anden
[1:08:23] he is the will in the middle of the
[1:08:25] wheel can you say Amen come on when the
[1:08:29] spies went over to see what it would
[1:08:31] take to take the land what they see they
[1:08:33] saw giants but two of them two of them
[1:08:37] remember a promise and they said we are
[1:08:40] more than able see they were looking at
[1:08:42] a promise despite the size of the Giants
[1:08:44] well come on somebody anybody ever faced
[1:08:47] any Giants in here anybody ever had any
[1:08:49] problems before come on anybody ever
[1:08:52] seen something that looked impossible if
[1:08:55] you look look at the promise that's what
[1:08:56] you need to look at and the promise will
[1:08:58] tell you nothing is impossible to them
[1:09:01] that believe so what we need to think
[1:09:03] about tonight is not not not looking at
[1:09:05] the at the things that are in front of
[1:09:06] us that are too hard to overcome but
[1:09:08] look at a promise that you're going to
[1:09:09] overcome amen quit looking at the
[1:09:11] looking at the size of the Giants and
[1:09:13] look to the promise that this is my land
[1:09:15] and I'm ordained to take this
[1:09:17] land I hope this is all right tonight
[1:09:19] I'm just I'm here to encourage you
[1:09:21] listen we're about out of this year but
[1:09:22] we got another year in front of us
[1:09:24] listen this could be 2020 right Lord
[1:09:26] help us oh no no just imagine the the
[1:09:30] end of 2019 everybody was preaching and
[1:09:32] they had no idea what was coming just
[1:09:34] think about it and then 2020 shows up
[1:09:38] and and there's a lot of churches today
[1:09:40] that are sitting empty because of
[1:09:42] that there's a lot of people that have
[1:09:44] never went back to church because they
[1:09:45] they got comfortable sitting at home in
[1:09:47] 2020 it was the devil all the time they
[1:09:50] got to looking and they got to looking
[1:09:52] at the things that were happening around
[1:09:53] them and it was just too much to
[1:09:54] overcome
[1:09:56] but this bride was looking at it and she
[1:09:58] was just getting closer and closer
[1:10:00] together don't let me sit out a church I
[1:10:02] want to get back to the house of God I
[1:10:04] remember the urgence of going back to
[1:10:05] church when we couldn't have church I
[1:10:07] wonder if we could get that again amen I
[1:10:09] don't want to look at maybe I'll have a
[1:10:11] reason not to go to church next week no
[1:10:13] I'm not looking for a reason not to go
[1:10:14] to church but I want to get back to the
[1:10:16] house of God because it's something on
[1:10:18] the inside of the Bride that wants to be
[1:10:20] in line with the word for the day oh yes
[1:10:23] amen it's not a reason listen you don't
[1:10:25] know what you're going to face in 2025
[1:10:27] you don't know the heartaches you might
[1:10:29] listen I'm not trying to hurt you but
[1:10:30] listen you don't know what's around the
[1:10:31] corner you don't know what's tomorrow
[1:10:34] but if you're looking to a promise then
[1:10:36] it doesn't matter what you face tomorrow
[1:10:38] because whatever comes the promise is
[1:10:41] still true can you say Amen we say well
[1:10:44] I want my children to be saved in 2025
[1:10:46] go ahead and make that promise tonight

[1:11:07] ti I'm going to listen come on church
[1:11:09] sometimes you got to call that Devil's
[1:11:10] Bluff and just tell him he has no power
[1:11:12] and authority over me cuz I'm looking to
[1:11:15] a
[1:11:16] promise if you're looking to how bad off
[1:11:19] you are if you're looking to how bad
[1:11:21] things have been right if you're looking
[1:11:23] to symptoms then you can never see the
[1:11:27] Promise amen but Abraham didn't look at
[1:11:30] the symptoms he didn't he didn't even
[1:11:32] consider the age of Sarah and mean he
[1:11:34] didn't consider how bad things were
[1:11:36] going to get he didn't consider that
[1:11:37] there was no way out of this situation
[1:11:40] but what he saw was a promise that there
[1:11:41] would be a son and I would say in this
[1:11:43] day there was a promise of a spirit to
[1:11:45] come and I say the spirit is here and
[1:11:48] it's up to us to go ahead and just
[1:11:50] remember that it's our time to accept
[1:11:52] the spirit that was to come and go ahead

[1:12:55] we start lining up to it and saying I'm
[1:12:57] getting ready to leave this world I'm
[1:12:59] getting ready why because I believe in a

[1:13:16] there's going to be somebody here to go
[1:13:18] in a Rapture somebody's going to be here
[1:13:20] in a Rapture so we might as well quit

[1:13:36] person the other day and a southern
[1:13:38] gospel singer actually there just an
[1:13:39] interview and and they were talking
[1:13:40] about how much they did not believe in a
[1:13:42] Rapture and I'm sitting there thinking
[1:13:44] how how can you read the scriptures and
[1:13:46] not believe in a Rapture and they said
[1:13:47] that that was not that was not part that
[1:13:49] was just like one verse in the Bible and
[1:13:51] it really didn't matter and I'm sitting
[1:13:53] there thinking you know you're not going
[1:13:55] to see a Rapture come on not saying
[1:13:58] you're not saved but you you may have to
[1:14:00] go through the tribulation I'm not here
[1:14:02] to look for a tribulation I'm not here
[1:14:05] to go down in the ashes of America but
[1:14:08] I'm here to be caught up with a bride of
[1:14:10] like-minded faith that believes in an
[1:14:12] end time message listen I'm looking
[1:14:14] forward to my loved ones coming from the
[1:14:15] grave I'm looking forward to that
[1:14:18] Resurrection morning when I don't have
[1:14:20] to be here no more there's no sin
[1:14:22] there's no sorrow there's no sickness no
[1:14:24] more there's no more problems with your
[1:14:26] bills but I can see that my loved ones
[1:14:29] have been there and I believe I'm going
[1:14:30] in a Rapture yeah you can say what about
[1:14:33] your faults what about your failures

[1:15:44] at the man that that that is inside of
[1:15:46] brother Joe that has held him all these
[1:15:48] years All These Years brother Joe had
[1:15:50] stayed here in the house of God why it
[1:15:53] wasn't because the flesh always felt
[1:15:54] like
[1:15:55] because God called him to be here why
[1:15:58] because he's got children that's got to
[1:16:00] be saved and he's got grandchildren that
[1:16:02] needed to go to church and come on
[1:16:03] somebody I'm not just looking to the
[1:16:05] problems of a man or a woman but I want
[1:16:07] to see what God has in mind for that
[1:16:10] generation that is to come sister
[1:16:11] Stephanie you was brought back to the
[1:16:13] house of God for a reason and now you're
[1:16:14] seeing the fruits of it with your son in
[1:16:16] the house of God listen God has a
[1:16:18] purpose for us God has a reason for us
[1:16:20] to be here and I'm here to tell you
[1:16:22] tonight quit looking at the difficulties
[1:16:25] and look through the
[1:16:27] promise every one of us have got plenty
[1:16:29] to look at that's negative but let's
[1:16:31] just quit looking at it for for a little
[1:16:33] bit hey man you know sometimes we see we
[1:16:36] see how bad off things are and we look
[1:16:39] at and we look at our finances and don't
[1:16:41] look at your bank account right now
[1:16:42] after the holidays it's not a good idea
[1:16:45] amen they'll send you a letter if it's
[1:16:48] overdrawn but you know you look at you
[1:16:51] you look how much money you spent don't
[1:16:53] do that don't look at your credit card
[1:16:54] bill
[1:16:55] those are
[1:16:58] negatives but what you what you
[1:17:00] do is if you're always looking at
[1:17:03] negatives you become a negative being I
[1:17:05] want to lay this in here before we close
[1:17:07] come on if you're always looking and
[1:17:09] dwelling on negative thoughts you become
[1:17:13] a negative
[1:17:14] being that's right is that all right
[1:17:17] nobody wants to be around constant
[1:17:20] negativity right nobody wants to be in
[1:17:22] the same room as somebody that is always
[1:17:24] always saying how bad off it is for them
[1:17:28] now we know you struggle and some of you
[1:17:31] have struggled a whole lot more than me
[1:17:33] some of you have struggled more than
[1:17:34] others in this room that's true some of
[1:17:36] you have been through things I couldn't
[1:17:39] handle that's just the truth of it some
[1:17:42] of you have faced challenges I couldn't
[1:17:44] have made God didn't put me through
[1:17:45] those things because he knew maybe I
[1:17:47] couldn't handle it but he allowed you to
[1:17:49] go through it now the truth of it is if
[1:17:52] you're constantly dwelling on the
[1:17:53] negatives and you quit looking at the
[1:17:54] promise all you can see your whole life
[1:17:56] is nothing but one trial after another
[1:17:59] and you fail to see that God is the one
[1:18:02] that brought you out of every one of
[1:18:03] them come on well I just can't make it
[1:18:06] no you can't make it on your own quit
[1:18:08] looking to yourself and start looking to
[1:18:10] the one who's been leading you the whole
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:14] time I'm not looking to myself to make
[1:18:16] it in a Rapture I'm looking to the god
[1:18:18] that has promised that there would be a
[1:18:20] bride and she'd be ready at the time of
[1:18:22] rapture amen that's good yes let me get
[1:18:25] on down here where I can close y'all
[1:18:27] still with me amen you've been wonderful

[1:18:30] time but let me just say this brother
[1:18:32] random said and he's talking to the
[1:18:34] people he said now you that are sitting
[1:18:36] here don't you dare look to any man yeah
[1:18:39] amen let me just say that again right he
[1:18:41] said don't you dare to look to any man
[1:18:45] come he said you look to Christ he is
[1:18:48] the one Glory but he promised in the
[1:18:50] last days that he would manifest himself
[1:18:52] in human flesh like he did there at
[1:18:53] Sodom now your flesh My Flesh let us
[1:18:56] just open our hearts and get our own
[1:18:59] thinking away and just let the word take
[1:19:03] its course tonight in us then I like
[1:19:08] this we'll see God's great gifts of his
[1:19:10] spirit manifested before us why don't we
[1:19:12] see more of God get yourself out of the
[1:19:15] way why don't we see Miracles get
[1:19:17] yourself out of the way why don't we
[1:19:19] have some services that that the go the
[1:19:21] God will really come and move in get
[1:19:23] yourself out of the way we can't work
[1:19:25] this up God is going to come any way he
[1:19:28] wants to whenever he wants to however he
[1:19:30] wants to he's going to save souls and
[1:19:33] bring back prodigals and raise up our
[1:19:34] young people to be a mighty Army of God
[1:19:37] I say I'm looking to the promise today
[1:19:40] I'm not looking to the failures of my
[1:19:42] past I'm not looking to the failures of
[1:19:44] your past I'm not looking to well come
[1:19:46] on somebody I'm looking at a promise and
[1:19:49] the promised land is here I'm resting on
[1:19:52] the message of the hour that is the
[1:19:54] promise Pro of the of God for me brother
[1:19:57] Brandon would go on like this brother
[1:19:59] Bron would saying friends don't look to
[1:20:01] me I'm your brother right that's I know
[1:20:04] that hurts some people that are always
[1:20:05] wanted to follow a man but he was not
[1:20:07] pointing you to him that's right he
[1:20:09] never one time said look at me look at
[1:20:11] brother random no he said Look to Him He
[1:20:13] was just one standing that was pointing
[1:20:16] to one that was to come come on Church
[1:20:18] listen I believe in the special man I
[1:20:21] Look to that man for I I I believe in I
[1:20:23] I like his opinions and I'll go ahead
[1:20:25] and say it like this if if he had
[1:20:27] Christmas I'll have Christmas but I'm
[1:20:28] going to go ahead and say it like this
[1:20:30] God didn't want me to just look at the
[1:20:31] humanity of the man but the man would
[1:20:34] stand there and say look to
[1:20:36] him that's right he said I'm just IM
[1:20:40] mortal a lot of people can't see that
[1:20:42] because of the great gift and the
[1:20:44] greatness of the man people cannot see
[1:20:46] the mortality of the man but he was just
[1:20:49] a moral and he was standing there he
[1:20:52] said I'm as helpless as any other man
[1:20:56] yeah that's right do we see that it was
[1:20:58] God through this entire message brother
[1:21:01] brandham couldn't stand there and
[1:21:02] discern the hearts of the people but God
[1:21:04] could do it through a man that would
[1:21:05] yield himself to the gift that was there
[1:21:09] amen if brother Brandon wouldn't have
[1:21:10] yielded himself brother Brandon would
[1:21:11] say it like this he said if a man won't
[1:21:13] yield himself then God will get somebody
[1:21:15] else to take that man's
[1:21:17] position hope this is all right tonight
[1:21:20] I'm almost done I'm almost out of time
[1:21:21] so I better be done he said I'm your
[1:21:23] brother I'm just Immortal I have to die
[1:21:26] like everybody else don't you listen to
[1:21:29] me but listen to what I've said what I
[1:21:33] said is the
[1:21:35] message come on we okay so far he said
[1:21:39] what I said is the message don't pay any
[1:21:41] attention to the messenger watch the
[1:21:43] message keep your eyes not on the
[1:21:45] messenger but on the
[1:21:48] message what it said that's the thing to
[1:21:51] look to so what am I looking to I'm
[1:21:54] looking to the message that is what's
[1:21:58] going to call me out of here brother
[1:21:59] brandom is not going to stand here and
[1:22:01] call me from the grave but the message
[1:22:03] will call me from where I was to where I
[1:22:06] will be amen and if the message is in me
[1:22:09] then guess what the voice of authority
[1:22:11] to call me from the grave is already on
[1:22:15] the inside of me and I believe that if I
[1:22:17] go down by way of grave there is
[1:22:19] something on the inside of me to
[1:22:21] resurrect me and if I'm here at the time
[1:22:23] of rapture then there is a voice on the
[1:22:25] inside of me that is going to call out
[1:22:27] come up high and I am going to leave
[1:22:29] this world and I'm going to go in a
[1:22:31] Rapture why it's not me it's not my
[1:22:34] voice but it is the message that I have
[1:22:36] ate and I have digested that message and
[1:22:38] I become one with that message I am a
[1:22:41] believer I believe in the message of the
[1:22:43] hour you say well is that important it
[1:22:45] is if you want to go on a Rapture are
[1:22:48] you looking to the message tonight you
[1:22:49] are if you want to go on a Rapture are
[1:22:51] you looking to some man's opinion of the
[1:22:53] message no I'm looking to the message
[1:22:55] that was brought by a Vindicated Prophet
[1:22:58] who would get himself out of the way and
[1:23:00] say don't look to me look to
[1:23:02] him oh thank you Lord Brother R said
[1:23:05] keep your eyes not on the messenger but
[1:23:06] on the message what it said that's the
[1:23:08] thing to look to I want to tell this
[1:23:11] story in closing you remember the story
[1:23:14] about the boy that was riding a bicycle
[1:23:16] on the plank and it was a contest come
[1:23:19] on and they'd give that boy a new swin
[1:23:22] bicycle if he could ride to the end and
[1:23:24] I I forget I think it was a 12 in for
[1:23:26] 100 yards 12 Ines across for 100 yards
[1:23:29] and brother BR would say there was boy
[1:23:31] after boy that would try to ride this
[1:23:33] plank and they would they would all get
[1:23:35] off one side fall off this side fall off
[1:23:37] the other and he said there was one boy
[1:23:39] that got on there and he said he he said
[1:23:42] he knew he was going to win this and and
[1:23:43] he said he said that little old
[1:23:45] boy there he just you know mama's boy
[1:23:47] like and none of them cared very much
[1:23:49] for him they all got on their time their
[1:23:51] numbers were called and they got on the
[1:23:52] board to ride each one fell off but this
[1:23:53] little boy boy you know what the
[1:23:55] world calls you sometimes they just want
[1:23:57] to call you names and the the world has
[1:23:59] tacked all kinds of names on this Church
[1:24:01] Holy Roller fanatic brandom mites
[1:24:04] whatever they want to call us I don't
[1:24:06] care what you call me but you're going
[1:24:07] to call me gone because I'm looking for
[1:24:09] a Rapture I don't care what you call
[1:24:11] come on church I don't care what you
[1:24:14] call me because one of these days I'm
[1:24:15] going to be looking down at this Canon
[1:24:17] fod that's called America or this Canon
[1:24:20] F that's called the Earth and I'm going
[1:24:22] to be caught up to meet my Lord in the
[1:24:23] air listen he said that he said that
[1:24:25] little boy He said Each one fell off but
[1:24:26] he said that little boy little boy
[1:24:28] wrode it right to the end never made a
[1:24:29] wobble and so all the boys got around
[1:24:31] him and said how did you do it he said I
[1:24:33] tell you here's what it was said I
[1:24:35] watched what you were all doing and I
[1:24:37] seen your mistake I hope this is okay
[1:24:40] but he said you were looking down like
[1:24:42] this trying to keep it on the board and
[1:24:44] I just watched the end and held steady
[1:24:46] well praise the Lord and he said I held
[1:24:48] steady there you are see he said that's
[1:24:50] the idea not what's right here but the
[1:24:53] end and keep steady keep looking to the
[1:24:57] Lord Jesus is what he said amen quit
[1:24:59] looking at the problems around you look
[1:25:01] to the end of this thing and stay steady
[1:25:04] sir is that okay tonight is that okay
[1:25:07] can we just start looking at the end
[1:25:09] look at the trophy that's at the end and
[1:25:12] quit looking at the distractions that
[1:25:14] are on each side of us trying to make us
[1:25:16] Fall
[1:25:17] Away amen more looking brother said more
[1:25:19] looking to the things musicians go ahead
[1:25:21] and come more looking to the things that
[1:25:23] are positive yeah
[1:25:25] I've used this quote in the ending of a
[1:25:26] lot of sermons and I just love it
[1:25:28] brother brandham is actually praying
[1:25:29] here and he said more looking to the
[1:25:31] things that are positive and forgetting
[1:25:34] the things that are in the past thank
[1:25:37] you Lord how many's willing to do that
[1:25:39] tonight am quit looking at your past and
[1:25:42] start looking to your
[1:25:45] future forgetting the things that are in
[1:25:47] the past and the
[1:25:52] negatives and the negatives
[1:25:55] yeah let me press towards the mark of
[1:25:59] the High Calling of
[1:26:01] Christ thank you Lord brother brandom
[1:26:03] says that's our desire isn't
[1:26:06] it I wonder tonight I've read this quote
[1:26:09] here
[1:26:10] before I wonder tonight if we couldn't
[1:26:12] just make that our prayer tonight if we
[1:26:13] could
[1:26:19] stand more looking to the
[1:26:22] things that are positive
[1:26:25] sir and forgetting the things that are
[1:26:29] in the past how many can do
[1:26:33] that the
[1:26:36] negatives there's a lot of negativity in
[1:26:38] your past but you don't have to look to
[1:26:41] that I failed as a parent quit looking
[1:26:44] at the
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:47] negatives I failed as a husband quit
[1:26:49] looking at the negatives I failed as a
[1:26:51] wife quit looking at the negatives
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:58] that's what a prophet
[1:27:01] said but more looking to the things that
[1:27:05] are
[1:27:07] positive can we do that
[1:27:09] tonight I wonder if we could say in
[1:27:12] 2025 with my hand up to the Lord I'm
[1:27:15] going to quit looking to the negatives
[1:27:17] in my past oh thank you Lord I'm going
[1:27:21] to forget those things well I can't
[1:27:23] forget brother Joel I'm going to forget
[1:27:26] those things and start thinking on the
