generation I I pray that it is our generation that gets to see the coming of the Lord amen we believe that we we have a message and it's get ready amen come out and get ready and be ready for that time so we're so thankful for that today I was planning on being gone today but uh at the meetings but we came back this morning drove in this morning my all of you guys that drive for two three hours to come to church my hats off to you because we did that this morning I have to come from Branson from the meetings and there's a bunch of folks over there from the church here so uh be praying for them for safe travels as they come home probably later today but we just enjoyed the meetings and got to dedicate the church there brother or help them be there while they dedicated the church brother Ben beard so that was uh also a place I went to church as a child and so we really enjoyed got to see the new building and things and eny enjoy the fellowship and but we're looking forward to What the Lord Has for us today now we've got uh brother Stewart's going to preach this morning just in case I had a flat tire I scheduled him to preach this morning and then I'm going to preach this afternoon and we'll have lunch as usual in between brother Paul Seymour is going to be baptized this afternoon and uh I hadn't yeah go ahead Brother Paul's been here at the church for some time he's a real Christian I believe in a man of God but he just uh he wanted to be closer to the Lord and and and really felt at this time to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so we're going to do that today and and uh just believe that uh that God will uh just bless him continue to bless him we've got uh his son Paul III with us as well this morning welcome thank you for being here and and uh if there anything we can do for you we sure love to do that we just love the people of God and we've learned to love brother Paul and sister Tracy and uh their giving spirit and their love for the church and their community and I believe he's a real Christian I'm going to go ahead brother Paul and and and read this now so I don't forget it when we come time to the baptism but uh brother Paul uh wrote a a little note about baptism and he said that baptism in our Lord Jesus's name he said not long ago an elderly elderly neighbor came to me and told me about getting B baptized in jesus' name in a local church he shared his uh his upbringing of that particular denomination that prompted him to do it he felt this qualified him to make it to heaven without any change in his daily life and uh Comm the Commandments from a church he said can give you a false sense of security so we don't want to ever we don't want to ever just uh just follow a Creed we want to do it because it's in our heart we want to serve God because it's in our heart don't you want to do that so that's what brother Paul is saying here he said we know it's a commandment of the word most important it's our desire to truly follow and live the word the message it's a sacred and important part of cleaning out our vessel to make room for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that's what we all want this morning isn't it the word says I cannot dwell in an unclean vessel I believe that so we're washed in baptism as a type as a symbol of being Washed by the blood of Jesus and and it shows the world that we belong on on Christ's side and he said if you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so we're just believing for a a filling of the Holy Ghost on brother Paul a refilling on all of us this morning how many could use a refilling of the Holy Ghost I think we could all use that this morning I believe it'd be helpful to us we we sure face a dangerous World a hard age and we need to know that we've got the Holy Ghost on our side and and we need to know that the word is with us amen amen God bless you let's stand together we'll invite brother Stewart to come don't you just love the Lord this morning man can we think the goodness of God and just worship him for just a moment as we invite brother steuart to come I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me all my days have been held in your hands do you believe that today from the moment that I wake up till I lay my head I will sing of the goodness of God sing it now oh my life have been faithful oh my life you have been so good oh with every breath that I am aable I will sing of the goodness of God I love your voice you have l me through the fire in darkest nights you are close like no other I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend and I have lived in the goodness God [Music] all my life you have been faithful all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am aable I will sing of the goodness of God amen is that your heart song this morning amen amen we certainly appreciate his presence let just play something softly if you have a need just lift that up to him this morning if you have a question upon your heart something in in your in your mind something that you need answered uh just lift that up to him and know that he's able this morning amen Lord Jesus we come before your throne this morning we come in worship to you Lord Lord we come to this house Lord to enter in the presence of God and Lord we we feel that we've done that this morning Lord Lord so won't you just come and identify yourself Among Us Lord Lord come and perform Lord what your word said Lord of what of what you would do of who you are Lord and so we just we look to you this morning every need every situation God we pray that you would just come upon the scene Lord and Lord may you just move me aside this morning may your word just go forth Lord may your people be ministered to Lord we Just Surrender our hearts to you this morning Lord may you bless your people Lord bless the word as that would go forth now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you love the Lord this morning amen if we could we turn the scriptures to Hebrews 11 and 6 just just happy to be here this morning amen amen amen I didn't know my mom and dad were coming good to see them and and U and Brother Paul's son it's it's good to Paul III good to have you I'll tell you what you've got one of the the best dads I one of the greatest men that I know so certainly a certainly a precious brother to us amen amen Hebrews 11 and6 just kind of the thought that we've had worship under Redemption for a while it's hard for me to get away from that there's so much there but just a title of faith in God remembering his promise to his children Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen you can be seated this morning man who's happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning and mean we just want to talk about faith just here for a little bit and just certainly just want to enjoy the presence of the Lord this morning amen so faith in God's word is what brings the results amen faith faith in God's promise is what brings him on the scene amen and so we look here uh something that brother R said here he said Faith knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith brings things when there is no things to be brought Faith creates Faith takes the doubt away it takes a negative and it makes a positive amen do you believe that this morning amen maybe you're in a negative part of your life amen but there is a positive coming amen and we don't have to live in that negative all the time but Faith tells us that there's something coming amen there's hope for the believer our faith can look past the negative and it can look to the positive and your faith can create that positive atmosphere amen you have that ability by the faith that you have in the word of God to create an atmosphere to where something can take place amen you have that power as a Believer this morning wisdom versus Faith he said what does faith do it just believes it the way it is amen the way that that God has has it preserved all the way down through the age he says here it is it's the word of God for me God Honors that and it gives a perfect faith in its truess amen Faith doesn't add or take away from the word amen Faith doesn't make excuses for the word amen it Faith just believes it the way it is it doesn't it doesn't try to reason in a way or try to figure it out amen Faith just says that's what it is and that's what it's going to be and it brings you from a negative to the positive right and anointed ones of the end time he says what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you come on faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be he said I've always loved this he said faith is a revelation of the will of God so if we can ever get a revelation of what God's will is what God's purpose is amen and live in that amen that's that's a revelation and nothing amen when you can get that revelation of the will of God and the purpose of God Amen nothing can move you off that and that's what faith is he says now Faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation he says there I want to say he said it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing that you figured out he said it's nothing that you did it's not you didn't work yourself up into Faith Amen to ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God Amen and God reveals it to you therefore is a revelation and the whole church is built upon Revelation amen is that what you're standing upon this morning it's not the revelation of a or the understanding of a man's idea or or your favorite preacher's idea but you yourself have a faith you yourself have a revelation of the promise of God for your life for the promise of God for this age amen and so and that will bring you from the negative of this this life because there's so much negative right Amen Let Let us look this morning amen by faith to the promise of God that will de Deliver Us amen amen he says here in perfect Faith he said perfect faith is a master of all circumstances amen perfect Faith Masters all circumstances there no matter what it is it Masters it he said when you believe anything do anything you've got to have faith and what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is amen that don't have one thing to do with it see it Masters that circumstance amen Faith believes that God will work it out do you believe that this morning amen amen amen let us believe amen let us not be in in disbelief and doubt amen amen no matter the situation no matter the circumstance amen God's going to bring me through it amen amen and that's what my faith looks to in this hour yes sir yes sir your faith is what brings him on the scene that's what brings God on the scene your faith and your love in his word amen that's the way of the believer and so in the time of trouble in the time of need whatever your need would be this morning whether it be a spiritual physical domestical Financial amen it takes faith in his promise and to receive of the blessing of the word you must believe that he is amen as we read he is a rewarder amen of those that diligently seek Him amen that he is the unchanging God that he's able to do what he said amen do you believe that this morning amen an an intellectual faith will only take you so far amen but when something drops in the heart of the believer amen you can believe from the heart amen and your face looks beyond all circumstance and it sees The God Who who is amen if we can just catch a glimpse of that God who is of that present God this morning amen it'll bring you through every circumstance amen Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever he says that's what we believe to be the truth that's what we accept that he is the same in principle he's the same in power he's the same in love he's the same in every way that he was then amen if you could just take that promise this morning if you could just take it under yourself amen all things are possible to them that believe you would say oh I wish I I wish Jesus would come by my way his word is who he is this morning his word identifies him in this hour and if you can accept it for yourself he'll be the same to you in every situation amen the god of History will be the god of the present amen we don't have to put it off for another day amen but he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the God we serve That's The God Who is is amen he said he said he would be in the midst of the church amen amen in Revelation man he he would be in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he would be in the midst of the church amen I am that he was amen I am and shall be amen and his power is in the midst of the church this morning and you've got to put the word on your lips amen and when you put the word on your lips that's the same as deity speaking amen that's the that's God coming forth from you amen and that's what brings him on the scene faith in his word amen the Bible says he's a very present help in a time of need I know this is simple we've heard these things amen but what a time of trouble we live in what a time of uncertainty that we live in amen but what an assurance a Believer has that no matter the circumstance that faith will master all circumstances thank you Lord amen we live we live in a very uncertain time these are tough times amen it's a tough time to to raise a family I'll tell you that right now I you know it's it's a burden as a as a husband as a father that I constantly carry with me and so you you know we were talking you know you're not supposed to be stressed out and it and at times you do get stressed out right but it's a burden that that we carry no no matter what it's always on our mind amen so it's a tough time to raise a family it's a tough time to think about bringing children in into this world but I say that God is able to bring you through I say God is able to make a way this morning for your family amen just go on serving God Amen and he'll make a way amen it's a hard time to try to get ahead yeah financially it's one of the most difficult times that's true right amen it's getting harder and harder to to be able to to function and to be able to operate and amen and and people are so wishy-washy about what they're going to do and what they're not going to do it's it's such uncertain times people don't know what to do but I say this morning in the midst of Uncertain times amen we serve an unchanging God Amen in the midst of your trial in the midst of your hardness amen he remains faithful he remains the same yesterday today and forever anden he remains the unchanging God yes sir that's come on talking about uncertain times brother B said an uncertain sound he said since F the time first began back in the Garden of Eden When sin came in and broke eternity into time he says I do not believe there's ever been a space of time with so much uncertainty as it is today because there's not there's not one hope left in the natural world today can you say Amen to that that that that's the time that we live in it's magnified that much more anden there's 's not a hope left for this world but the coming of the Lord Jesus amen that's all our hope that's all of our peace this morning that's all of our rest amen and amen and and just to get ready for that amen that that's what we've got to strive towards to make yourself ready he goes on the nation's uncertain it's an uncertain sound he said who knows what to do he said jobs politics is uncertain Church is UNC home life is uncertain he said what is certain is there anything certain and he said there's one thing that I'll guarantee you certain and that's the word of God and Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail amen just as God said it it's going to come to pass just be as certain amen as you've ever been in this world amen amen that God will bring his word to pass amen if you can put that promise upon your heart put that promise upon your lips amen God will not fail you in this hour because the word cannot fail oh thank you Lord anden he goes on before there was a world before there was uh before Jesus Christ was ever born the Bible says that he was a lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world Amen and for when God's program was drawn out and he knowed what was going to happen in his great mind and he slew amen and he that lamb and his own son just saved the world and it was settled as as soon as God spoke it amen so you don't have to come off of it this this morning amen if God has spoke upon your life if he's called your name you don't have to come upon off of that amen don't let nobody talk you out of that it's already settled amen if your name is on that book it's settled before the foundation of the world it will settle before Satan could get a hold of your life amen and when God spoke to you and called your name amen he sealed you Amen in that book of life amen oh thank sealed you by the Holy Ghost so God what is God's program is a Plan of Redemption that's God's program to bring us back to what we were in his mind Amen to bring us out of this present chaos amen by his mighty hand you believe that amen you think about your needs this morning whatever your need would be amen we can draw from the promises of God Amen Philippians 4:19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus whatever your need would be this morning there's enough power in that promise if you can draw from that Amen to God for God to bring it to pass for God Amen if you'll put that word amen upon upon your lips amen amen whatever the need would be you say you got a financial need this morning amen my God owns cattle on a thousand hills amen the Bible says I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor SE begging bread amen God won't let you go without amen we may not be the richest we not may not be the greatest amen we can say Faithfully this morning we can say with confidence as a children of God Amen we've never went without amen God has always made a way God has always provided and so our fath looks to that sir amen thank you Lord he'll supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus and so what does that word Supply mean is means to make full to fill up amen fill yourself up this morning amen fill yourself up with the goodness of God fill yourself up with it this morning amen God will cause you to abound amen amen he'll fill you up this morning to where you don't you can't take no more of it if you want if you want more of God this morning if you if you've got a need this morning he's able he's ready Amen to come upon the scene in this hour amen if you'll just ask him if you'll ask in faith amen yes sir amen I believe the Holy Ghost is Among Us I believe that the pillar of fire has returned to the church on do you believe that in this hour do we recognize amen who's Among Us amen do we recognize amen amen let's just let loose this morning let's let's realize amen and so and so we may not visually see something amen but we can see the effects of it in our lives we can see the change and the power that it brings amen amen may Jesus Christ identify himself Among Us amen not something of the past not something that we're looking to back then but this morning he can identify himself in your life and in your need I believe that thank you Lord fill you to the brim yes sir amen Supply amen it's in it's it's an everlasting Fountain this morning amen we're not going to run out amen you're not going to exhaust God you're not going to exhaust that Fountain amen but you've got to come you've got to drink this morning Proverbs 28 and 20 a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not not be innocent and so being faithful in in the things of God being faithful to his word being faithful in what he has given you will bring the blessing of God do you believe that this morning amen God requires our faithfulness amen amen if you're sitting by idle if we're sitting by lazy that's one thing amen but if you're a faithful child of God this morning amen I believe the blessing of God is upon your life amen amen we may we may brother and S we may back we backslide every day amen we we all do things things wrong every day but we quickly repent we quickly get back in the grace of God amen amen and I say this morning there's no condemnation in the heart of a Believer this morning in Christ Jesus amen you can come with faith you can come with confidence under the blood of Jesus Christ clothed in his righteousness and you can ask God whatever you have need of this morning oh yes I'm not trying to work you up I just this it just what I couldn't get away from it amen amen we're living in a time of need and he can supply our needs amen amen we need and we need more of him this morning amen so I'd rather be rich this I'd rather be blessed this morning than Rich wouldn't you I'd rather have the blessing of God upon my life than all the riches that you could give me amen the blessing of God Amen it'll bring you Joy it'll bring you peace amen amen it'll bring Salvation to your children money can never buy that riches can never buy that amen but being faithful will bring the blessing of God upon your life you believe that this morning brother BR says I'd rather feel in my heart the presence of Christ that I feel now than to have the riches of this world that's right I love him and he's wonderful can you say Amen to that this morning amen I'd rather have the joy of the Holy Ghost than the joy of the world Amen I'd rather have the joy of God and the happiness of God than than anything that this world can offer amen because it's Everlasting amen amen you could run out of money you could run out of this you could run out of that you could you could sell your possessions and get money then you'd run out amen but you'll never run out of this amen for it is an everlasting Fountain amen amen it's a bubbling spring amen that can overflow in The Believer amen it's whatever you have need of this morning amen he is able a blessing of God Amen we look at Faith here what is what is Faith it's the foundation of who we are as Christians it's the foundation of the believer and so brother Brown says he says You must be born again when and when you're born again amen you cannot be born again without having faith faith is the foundation of it all for without faith it is impossible to please God Amen but you must believe that he is an a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him amen and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're a skeptic of the word being right you might as well just stay back until you can believe it and he said what is sin it's unbelief and there's only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of that one and that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have how high you can rise how many Born Again people do we have here this morning amen if you're born again by the word of God you can't help but believe the word of God because that's that's what's your birth from you're not birth from an idea you're not birth from just just a uh a certain experience amen but your birth to believe the word amen and if you're birth to believe the word amen amen there's nothing amen that you can't receive from God in this hour amen there's nothing amen there's nothing that too negative amen that that positive that Faith won't bring you through amen let your faith rise this morning amen let your faith rise shake the doubt shake the demon of unbelief shake the demon of formal ideas and and and then and the devil that says you can't can't have this and try to talk you out of something amen Shake That spirit this morning amen shake the LIE the devil that he told you you can't make it that you can't get through that you can't have your healing amen shake the LIE of the devil this morning and believe the word amen don't be beat down as a son or daughter of God Amen come on Lord help us this morning I got a long way to go amen Romans 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ so that word Justified means you're free this morning amen that he has Justified you he has made you righteous amen by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God Amen you can stand and rejoice this morning amen you can have confidence this morning amen amen he is your justification amen he is the one that made you free in this hour he is the one that freed you from your old life of Doubt amen he is our justifier this morning amen and he was raised for our justification and the holy spirit amen amen has brought you from death unto life amen to believe the word in this hour than Lord to sit in Heavenly places amen we look here we're living in the greatest time that the world has ever known it's a time of fulfilling of every promise it's the greatest time of Mercy yet it's the the world Waits it's a greatest it's greatest judgment amen judgment is upon this Earth you believe that amen we're living amen under the prejudgments of God God waiting to take his bride from this Earth and before his full judgment can come upon this Earth amen he has to take his bride away amen you're holding everything back this morning you're holding back the wrath of God and this our do you believe that do you understand that amen what you mean to the economy of God what you mean in this hour and so it's going to take it's going to take more faith brother B said in this hour than ever before amen for we have the promise of the Rapture the coming of the Lord and so the only way we will ever make it the only way we will ever make it is under the leadership of the Holy Ghost the only way that we can be the right kind of people the right kind of Christians the right kind of father and mother the right kind of young people is to be filled by the Holy Ghost and to be led by the Holy Ghost and I say if you're led by the Holy Ghost this morning it will inspire you to do the will of God that's what the Holy Ghost is therefore is to inspire you to do the word of God Amen yes sir Hebrews 11 and 23 well brother Ben I sure wish you to been you this morning buddy do me like that Hebrews 11:23 you love the Lord this morning I'm preaching with all I've got amen get a little bit of water here I drunk about two bottles in the back I guess that wasn't enough amen Hebrews 11:23 by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because when they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment I love that by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin first season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward and so we look at these people here and and we talked about you know it's a hard time to raise a family and I think we can draw from the word and look at the at the faith and the belief of this family here come on and so these were these were people that weren't afraid of what the world said come on they weren't willing just to go along with the times but they were identified with God's promise of Deliverance and and no matter how long they were in Egypt it they didn't bend to the ideas or the system of that day amen may we be that kind of people amen God has called us in this hour to a life of faith and worship amen amen and not to be constantly burdened down with this life amen but to have freedom but have have freedom and liberty in the Holy Ghost not to be slaves of a system but to have fre Freedom as Sons and Daughters of God and Satan will do all he can Amen to destroy or hold that back that Liberty of the children of God his purpose is to to destroy your faith amen the design of his kingdom is to make you and I God's people too busy for the things of God that's the design of this Satan's Eden to make us burden down amen but there's a liberty this morning amen for the children of God amen amen we don't have to live under that burden there is a promise of Deliverance for you and I amen and that Deliverance has come in this hour I say by the word of God Amen it's freed us from man's tradition it's freed us from the ideas of denomination amen it's freed us from the things of the world Amen and it's called us out of this chaos amen we've heard a voice in this hour Amen to come up high oh there's a Deliverance for you and I in this hour amen yes sir amen but Satan will constantly amen try to bring us under that burden on and so I say let your faith amen rise above that this morning don't let Satan put you under the things amen that God has promised for us in this age amen we're we're living in Satan's Eden we're living in the design of Satan amen we're amen where we get too busy to pray we get too much on our mind to even relax in the presence of God and when you get to a spot like that amen it begins to break down your relationship with God even it begins to break down your relationship with brothers and sisters it breaks down our home life amen but I believe this morning we shall obtain by faith the promise of God Amen by faith we can break that curse we can break the curse that the enemy would try to put us under that burden in this hour do you believe that amen by faith we can break the cycle of Satan's kingdom and I say this morning Amen Let there be a faith this morning let there be a worship in your heart in the house of God Amen if Satan's built up walls around you this morning tear those walls down if he's built up things and complexes in your mind break those things down if he's built up a tiredness in your body there's a supernatural strength that can come into you Amen to make you pray Amen to make you Amen to bring your home amen under subjection of the word of God Amen I'm just preaching this morning come on Lord help me Lord help y'all he says then also we have a home life crisis and it seems like that the home life is running out in the shallow water I'll just read this to you it used to be in a home that the Father the head of the house would sit down of a morning and he would speak in his with his family and they would all take out the old Family Bible and just read it a little bit and all gather around the table and have prayer he said you don't see that no more and when one one that when that day was done and Ma had the dishes washed they'd all Gathering and read some more of the Bible and pray before going to bed that sounds like simple times don't it yeah simple times we've got too much going on yeah that's right we've got too much in front of us I've got too much in front of me amen the world looks down on that kind of life but I believe there's a people this morning that's going to break the cycle that is breaking the cycle I believe that this morning I believe that we can break this cycle amen and we can come we can come in the presence of God and let him Amen in every door of our home and our life you believe that thank you Lord does your faith tell you that this morning amen what a negative that we live in what a negative is projected to us but your faith will bring you to that positive in this hour and your faith isn't just something we talk about come on it's works it produces something in your life that's right but he talks about that he says ju juvenile delinquency he said in those days was certainly a a hard thing to find the boys all went out to the fields to work and the girls help with the with the washing down at the creek but today we push a little button and the dishes are all done and M's in the car going to the card party C party and out riding around over the streets and the work is done by a tractor and we just don't have nothing to do but just a bunch of lazy idle people oh my and home life is so neglected till the Bible is laid back till they don't they don't have to hunt they'll have to hunt for an hour to find one in the many homes in America he said they go to church on Sunday for religion for about 20 minutes if the pastor takes about 30 minutes he's called on the board what is it home life is running out what has

cycle amen man come on and I know these children here that their parents pray with them I know their CH their their parents read them the Bible and I think we've got such a fine group coming up amen let's not throw them to the side let's not let's not put them on the back burner amen but they've got just as much right to the power of the Gospel amen as the oldest the middle age amen they've got just as much right amen these could be the next preachers these could be the next Preachers Wife future song um song leaders singers amen anointed by God Amen to bring the presence of God down Amen in our services in our homes amen this is your future here amen amen what's happened Christ is on the outside knocking trying to get in that's right amen but he he wants to be Lord over everything in our lives amen I say this morning let's open our homes to him let's open our family to him amen if we got problems if we got things amen get rid of your problems put get the Bible back in there get prayer back in there and watch the problems leave watch The Devil flee begin to worship God amen amen by rededication amen amen and watch Satan leave because he can't stay in that presence amen let's open our prayer life to him open the door brother R said open the door of indifference open the door of Pride open the door of that selfishness of where you're holding back amen open the door of your heart this morning and let Fai the faith of the Son of God come in amen and if you can let that Faith come in you can believe from the heart every promise of God Amen it's yours this morning and absolute he said a real born and again people of this age is filled with the Holy Ghost amen the ti poost amen is the scripture in this hour amen that's their ultimate God is the ultimate amen the word is Christ and that's their toost he says Moses he said it made Moses do ordinarily he he things he wouldn't do it makes a man and a woman do things they wouldn't do ordinarily it makes makes you that you're centered it's something amen it's your stabilizer amen it's your anchor in this hour amen you've got to have an absolute in this hour amen it is the word of God it's the revelation of God it will stabilize you through the storm it'll bring your family through in the times of hardness in the times of trouble no matter what it is amen amen there's an absolute that will bring us through and he said a born again Christian is tied to Christ the Bible is the anchor he said let the organizations let the different thing let the science let the Educators say what they want as long as the word says that promise we're tied to that amen there's something that won't let us move from it amen he says it's a Christ centered life amen that's the kind of life that I want amen that's the kind of life that I want to live amen TI to an absolute and that will bring us through amen thank you Lord Moses's parents we look here they were parents who knew the promise of God for for deliverance in Genesis God told Abraham thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them for 400 years and he said in that Nation shall I judge and I will bring them out with great substance and so this family a family of prayer they had prayed for that promise of God to come to pass amen they were looking for it to come to pass in their generation and so this was a family that wasn't that didn't bend to the things of the world they didn't bend to the king's what the king said amen they were not willing and I want you to get this this morning they were not willing Amen to allow their child to be sacrificed as parents we have a responsibility Amen to commit and raise our children in the fear of God Amen to respect the house of God Amen I say what they see they will do what they see in us that's what they're going to mimic amen if we tend to drift towards the things of the world that's what they're going to do but if we put an emphasis on the things of God and the faithfulness and the faithfulness of God will bring the blessing amen that's what they're going to drift towards and I realize that you know kids are going to do what kids are going to do amen but we've got a responsibility to put that in front of them absolutely what they see they will do they will watch our dedication they will watch how we worship in the house of God am me in our our young people as we said they shouldn't be left out am me the power of God of the Gospel amen is for the oldest this morning Amen to the youngest the Holy Spirit can deal amen with anyone amen with them is the same as anyone amen yes sir yes sir your children need to know that you love them you can read all the books you want to read on I don't want nobody telling me how to raise my kids I don't want no worldly idea or some atheist or somebody that has got some strange ideas your kids need to understand that you love them yeah that's right and if if they understand that you love them they will trust you amen and they will they will follow you amen that's good our children must know that we love them come on that's the greatest thing we can do is love our kids teach them to love the word respect the things of God respect the house of God amen the power of the devil he says when Moses was born Moses God's instrument chosen provided for ordained elected predestinated by God to be his tool to work with in that age Satan was doing everything that he could to catch him but God pulled it over on him oh thank the Lord he says here we find there's a a son of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi when that child was born they recognized that it was a proper child he said the mother would looked at the child and she knew that something was taking place remember these were these were people that were praying for the promise to be fulfilled they were looking me for God to move on the scene and when you're looking for those things that's when God can reveal his plan to you amen and she knew that the time was now that they should be delivered and he said and the Holy Spirit of my opinion revealed to her this is him and she wasn't afraid of the king's Commandments and his threats amen Satan has always Satan tried to get one over but they they slid old Moses out they hid him from there but Satan has always tried to destroy the seed of God that's always been his purpose is to destroy that seed amen but I say this morning amen from the message if you're a son or a daughter of God you were in God all the time and a prophet of God said he knew what bed and time you'd be planted so he made you a creature a Son of God a manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour the true and living God Amen to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time that's a call of God upon our young people in this hour amen amen amen the that's the life of a predestinated child Amen in this hour Amen to meet the challenge to meet the challenge of this hour Amen to take the promise of God and to meet the devil and say that that that that we will be a people that break the cycle we will be a people that overcome in this hour yes sir thank you so the mother she wasn't afraid of the king's commandment they're being revealed to her that that her son would be the deliverer so she she committed him to God she committed him to the basket to the river the Bible says that I slammed it she sealed it and there she she placed her son her child in the jaws of the of the of the crocodiles there but she had a revelation of the plan of God and so that's what I'm trying to get to if we can get to it by God's help if you can get a revelation of the plan of God no matter what you're going through amen no matter what you what you have to go through because we can't get out of everything in this life we've got to go through some things amen but God Amen if you're a part of his predestinated plan if you're forward and God will bring you down the river of life he'll bring you through the crocodiles he'll bring you through the fire he'll take you to the other side amen you love the Lord this morning thank you Lord amen faith in the promise in this hour amen when it's revealed to you the devil can't move you amen do you believe that that's right Romans 8:38 for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor he nor death or any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God that which is in Christ Jesus our lord that's the confidence of the believer in this hour that's the confidence of the Christian in this hour that God's going to bring me through no matter what take takes place the prophet said here he said I found in my life Journey especially in my Ministry when Satan makes a big fight he knows there's a great blessing laying ahead so it's always at those times that we like to go on I say go on this morning go on no matter how hard the times get no matter what the struggle is amen amen if Satan's fighting you that's a pretty good indicator that you're trying to do something for God that you're trying to live for God Amen he will make it so hard on you he will bring every Temptation your way he'll put you amen and and God allows us to go through but Satan likes to turn the heat up a little bit but I say go on this morning amen amen if the believer has a confidence this morning that God will bring them through no matter what it is Amen on on the other side I believe it's a blessing for you and I you say you're struggling financially amen God is able to provide this morning he's able to make a way this morning he's able to bring it through amen he's able to to soften hearts and Harden Hearts he's able to bring things your wayen he's able to open open doors he's able to make things work for your good thank you Lord I'm not trying to preach a Prosperity deal come on we're not we're not meant to be a rich people come on we're not we're not not meant to be rich but we're we're called to be blessed amen as simple as I can make it that that's as simple as you can be we're called to be a blessed people amen he sees your burdens this morning amen he sees your burdens as he looked down upon the children of Israel began to hear hear their cry amen he begin to see their Affliction he be to see the oppression they were under and I say this morning he still hears the cries of his people there's a Deliverance amen there's a liberty in Jesus Christ for those that are bound this morning thank you Lord he said Moses had an understanding that he was to be the deliver from the teaching of his mother and he trained himself in military might to do so but but he failed he had the understanding he had the education but that didn't work so he had to forget it all and come to the simple thing of taking God at his word and then God delivered the people yes sir so amen it's more than an intellectual Faith an intellectual Faith as we've said many times an intellectual faith will only bring you so far but it's got to be something that anchors down it's got to be something that's real amen it's got to be more than your own power power your own doing amen the Bible says not by might not by P power but by my spirit say the Lord amen this mountain shall be removed amen it's by his spirit it's by his power Moses couldn't go down there and do nothing he understood that there was a Deliverance he understood that there was a promise but it took God through Moses and it'll take God through you and I Amen to come out of this this olday the see an age it'll take God and you and I Amen to take a rapture yes thank you so it's more than a workup it's more than intellectual Faith you've got to meet God though we understand though we've had had knowledge of these things amen you've got to meet God on those sacred grounds amen you've got to meet the pillar of fire just like Moses did in that Pillar of Fire amen amen the Bible says it was a bush that didn't burn and it attracted the prophet but it was the voice that came from the sign the fire that instructed the prophet amen the fire the Bush was a sign we can go out and we can see all kind of bushes burning or whatever but it's a voice that comes from the fire amen that stabilizes you that it gives you the understanding it gives you the confidence amen and when that meeting takes place amen it takes away all fear it removes all doubt amen because it takes away I can't because it's a God Amen that goes with you and in you thank you Lord amen we've got to have an experience we've got to have an experience amen amen not just an understanding but you've got to meet the god that made the promise in this hour the Bible says when the spirit of truth shall come he will show you all things amen when he comes when you meet that God when you have that experience amen when you've met that Pillar of Fire amen then you can stand on thus sayith the Lord and then you can stand on the face of the enemy unmovable unshakable amen anden you can stand and say no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against me in judgment I shall condemn amen amen you are part of the word and the word is part of you amen and you become the word made flesh amen and that's defeat defeated Satan on every ground amen we'll try to wer down here try to give you a little Grace this morning amen been a while since I preached so we're just getting back in the swing of things here amen amen we've been working under the task Masters out working you know we got to we got to provide we got to make a way amen but amen nothing should take place of the house of God or the things of God Amen what he's called us to do Exodus 5 And1 and afterward Moses and Aaron went and told Pharaoh thus say the Lord God of Israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness Pharaoh would say who is the Lord that I should let his people go I know not this God neither will I let his people go but see they wanted to go worship the god of their fathers he told him he said get you to your burdens get back get go on get so he he would begin to make it hard on them he he took away the straw to make bricks and it would cause him to have to work even more cause them to be under uh that much more anguish anguish but when God begins to bring deliverance and the holy spirit amen begins to move that's when the devil tries to make it harder on you amen but we've been called To Worship in this hour we've been called to a feast of the word amen we've been called To Worship under the mighty hand of God I believe that there's a God on the scene this morning Pharaoh wanted a compromise he went on he wanted to compromise won't you just leave for a few days you know you can go out you know go where you want to go but leave your wives leave your children leave your cattle leave here and go without them and so that's just what the devil does he wants to make a compromise I say don't compromise with the world in this hour don't compromise with science don't compromise with intellectual faith that says it's this way amen if you know the plan of God stick to the plan of God if God's anointed you in this hour to be the Bride of Jesus Christ amen take what he said about you and be that so he knew that that if all their possessions were still in Egypt that they would have to come back that their heart would still be in Egypt right that's right and so there can't be anything that draws you and I back when we leave this place we're leaving you understand we're not leaving nothing behind anden we're taking everything he said brother I'll tell you when Israel got ready at midnight they had everything they had in this world packed up and ready to go he says God send us a Revival like that we pack up everything and Let It Go Go ye out to meet him he said you better be packed up not have nothing in this world luring you back the strings to hold you down let's get ready we're going he said and you know what I tell you amen they was so true to god Till Pharaoh got so excited may not he said get out get out am man take everything and go and go he said I I'm so thankful that a man can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him amen if you'll begin to make preparations if you'll begin to make things right amen the devil just I I tell you this morning I believe he'll back up off of you I believe it this morning amen yes sir we'll just finish up here Exodus 61 then the Lord said unto Moses now Thou shalt see what I will do to Pharaoh for with the strong hand he shall let them go and with a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land and God spake unto Moses and said un him I the Lord I appeared unto Abraham Isaac and Jacob and by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known of them I have also established my Covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers and I also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians kept in bondage and I've remembered my Covenant amen God remembers his promise he don't never forget amen he can't never forget you and I amen we're engraved in the palms of his hands he goes on here he says wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from your burdens of the Egyptians and I will rid you out of their bondage and I will redeemed you with an outstretched arm with a with great judgments and man he told Moses he he said now shalt thou see what I will do anden he told Moses what he was going to do before he did it amen he and he told him amen he gave him an understanding he gave him a revelation and I say in this hour amen we've read the back of the book amen we've seen that Satan's going to be destroyed amen amen we know that we're going through in this hour amen amen don't let nothing hold you back don't let nothing keep you from rising up your position as a son or daughter of God Amen we're going through in this hour amen God has God has told us what his plan is his Plan of Redemption Amen to restore us Amen to bring us back oh thank you Lord yes sir yes sir we'll finish up with this musicians can come Ephesians 13 in whom also you trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise so we're sealed by the Holy Ghost in This Hour amen it's a holy spirit of promise and the Bible says that we're sealed to what to the day of our Redemption he says there which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory amen you're sealed in this hour by the Holy Ghost that's the the moving of the Holy Ghost amen that's where he wants to bring the believer amen it's a ceiling amen where where the devil is sealed out and God sealed in and we're the purchase of his possession you're the purchased possession of the blood of Jesus Christ now he can no more lose you than anything amen he has paid the price for your redemption in this hour he's gave the down payment amen the full amount will come at the fullness of redemption yes sir I believe it amen we're here for the praise of his glory he told Moses he said you will bring this people to this mountain to worship me so Moses could go down there with a confidence and know that God was going to bring them to this mountain no matter what troubles amen would would come what they would go through amen what comes what goes amen we have the promise of redemption in this hour amen the full of redemption God has redeemed us as Sons and Daughters of God Amen but there's a day of redemption coming amen well he will claim his possession claim his children amen you stand this morning amen if you got a need this morning we'd be glad to pray with you amen we know that God is able we believe that he's here Amen to meet every need every request
