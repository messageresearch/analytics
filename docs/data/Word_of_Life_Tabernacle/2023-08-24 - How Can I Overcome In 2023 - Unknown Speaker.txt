best Lord for our families for for the word that's preached Lord for the songs that are sung We want you to be present Lord we believe you are here tonight because you promised to be here because we feel that you are here and so Lord we ask you to just take free imminence in this service we want you to move in a mighty way Lord may it not just be in other Wednesday night but maybe our night tonight that we receive that that word Lord that we needed to be able to make it or through life and we thank you we'll give you the praise for it I pray that for those that are sick those that are in need Lord not feeling well tonight I pray you just reach down lord whether I'm in the Dove of the Holy Spirit settle down lord in the homes where they are Lord and may they be completely well we pray in Jesus name amen [Music] amen hallelujah let's turn to Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21. Revelation 3 21 we'll forget we have the uh brother Allen teaching on finances Sunday at 1 30. we'll uh try to let you out an appropriate time where you can get to that those of you that want to go I would encourage you especially us younger couples to go if we can and we'll have that this weekend and then the next weekend we'll have to skip that week because it's a holiday weekend Labor Day and so we're going to not have a second service on Labor Day as is our custom on holiday weekends so if you're planning something for Labor Day we'll just have one service that that weekend and I believe it's Labor Day coming up isn't it not very good on the holidays so just be remembering that brother Wendell Martin has meetings the brother that preached here for us he has meetings coming up I'm going to go to those in two weeks starting in two weeks from tonight I'll be here on Wednesday but then we'll go up there on Thursday of that week and so anybody that would like to go he extended his invitation to you and and said that they'd find a place to put you up if you wanted to go so if anybody was thinking about going let me know if you didn't have a place to stay I'm gonna go and and try to fellowship with them we appreciate their friendship and I'm sure it'll be a good meeting I'm sure you have good Services here as as well and and then we'll just continue on and believe in the Lord hasn't God been good to us these Sunday night services lately just been the presence of God so real I believe that can be every service and and it just we just need to commit ourselves completely to the Lord and let him do what he does through US amen amen and Revelation 3 21 good to be in church with you tonight to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne I pray the Lord when that is blessing to the word you may be seated this evening I want to speak to you tonight on how can I overcome in 2023 how can I overcome in 2023 I was thinking of preaching I've got a series that I'm studying on something doctrinal maybe that will be coming up but as I begin to think about these things I I realize that we're all uh there's things that we all need to overcome and the age that we live in and we've been given a message that it enables us gives us the tools to do that and I don't care whether you're 16 or or 86 in the service tonight there's some things that you need to overcome and I have things that I have to overcome having something to overcome doesn't mean that you're a sinner it means that you're a Christian and and you need to overcome that and I see so many people when they begin to things begin to happen maybe they fail in some way or or they struggle in some way and so they start hanging out at church and and they begin to fall back a little bit from the house of God and and they begin to kind of kind of move back from the presence of God no that's the time to move closer that that's the time to go to church that's the time to really press the battle is when you're struggling because that's the hour when you need him the most because the word of God tells us how to overcome in our day don't you love that tonight that the word of God has given us the tools that we need as I said here not long ago brother Branham didn't leave the scene and and take the tools with him and and say finish the work with no tools that's not what he did but he gave us the tools the message of the hour so that the work could be finished we can go home one of these days so we have the tools to do that now everybody fails everybody makes mistakes if you don't make mistakes it means you're not doing enough right and and there's one thing someone said there's one redeeming thing about a mistake it proves that somebody stopped talking long enough to do something and the old saying I'd rather try and fail than fail to try right we make mistakes brother Branham says it this way it always struck me he said I'd rather be on the battlefield making mistakes than criticizing someone that's trying to do something for God so I'd rather be on the battlefield and even though I might make a mistake out there at least I'm in the fight right so we but we make mistakes and yet even in our mistakes we don't do things as Christians I believe I'm speaking to mostly Christians here tonight we don't purposely go against the word of God and and cross the word of God and yet every day we do things maybe that we would like to do better or or some Omission some mistake of you know sometimes I I find myself I need to deal with something and I just don't deal with it in the kind of with the kind of urgency that it needs to be dealt with and that's on me that that's a problem that I have but the word of God teaches me how to do that how to deal with things and and even in my family my home in the church and all of us come to that same place we make mistakes but we are washed from our mistakes by the water of the word we are not victims we are not we are not well uh well we'll just we'll just have to keep doing what we're doing we're not a bunch of people that have to keep repeating the mistakes of the past we don't have to do what our parents did we don't have to do what the what they did 20 years ago or 10 years ago or five years ago or one year ago we can change things and it's up to us to do that and every day we ought to be vigilant about that right can I give you a little reference of something I I read today actually and it's kind of carnal but I read that uh you know the the Chiefs have won the Super Bowl a couple times recently and but Joel you can just shut your ears for a moment but they won the Super Bowl and I was reading about their coach and and his attention to detail and and they said what he'll do is he'll actually you come in one time and he called over the management he said he said did you notice the goal post when when we came in and they said no we didn't notice the goal post he said go look at it and there was a was a scratch on the goal post he said he said now what do you think he said when you bring a player in here that we want to we want to make him a Kansas City chief he said what do you think that does to us as an organization how that represents the Kansas City Chiefs to have a scratch on the goal post well he had a guy go out and paint it and it's easy to do but hard to see right and the thing is we get little scratches on the goal post we get little things that we just don't take care of and pretty soon there's something else and pretty soon there's something else and after a while it's something else and we let a little depressed Spirit sit around us for a while and some little Spirit of something else been around us for a while we don't deal with it pretty soon we uh we find ourselves out of church we found ourselves back slips wow we didn't deal with it while we had the opportunity now's the time to deal with it the Bible says today is the day of salvation today's the day to change your life for the better don't wait everybody loves a good Redemption story but don't wait until you're washed up or or to you on your last legs until you're uh get in by the by the skin of uh of your fingertips but wait but now is the time to serve God especially if you're young give him the strength of your youth serving while you're young so we we come to church we come here for a purpose brother Brown said for one specific purpose he said this is the house of correction this is the throne have you ever thought about it like that he said this is the Throne of God and and judgment Goes Forth from the house of God he said the Holy Ghost is among us and we're here to take Reckoning among us to see where our short places are now that's just not your short places that's my short places some of us have shorter places than others but we do we have short places places where we don't meet the mark he said how we can catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be he said and that's what we've studied ministers studied those places for their people when they see the people the lack he said then they begin on that I said brother Ben why are you always preaching about certain things well it's because you study where the people are that's what you study and then that's where you preach and and hopefully those two are the same things now because we don't if I can preach against something nobody here is doing and I can preach against that number said praise God for that you know and everybody's happy and everybody's excited get behind it we can we can attack some group over somewhere I could spend all my time on that but that's not what we're dealing with that's not what we're fighting here are you with me now so we got to deal with what we're what we're what are our challenges what do we need to overcome in 2023 that's good and so I typed into Google and if you could show that brother Robert I believe I put a picture on there of this I typed into Google how can I overcome and you know Google has suggestions and what this is based on is what this is based on is you probably can't see it from the back but what it's based on is uh is searches that are done in our area so it locates you and then it it says this is what this is the searches that have been done how can it overcome and I thought this was interesting it says how can I overcome depression how can I overcome anxiety how can I overcome social anxiety do you see a trend how can I overcome fear how can I overcome jealousy how can I overcome procrastination how can I overcome loneliness it's a big one how can I overcome lust how can I overcome stress I need that one how can I overcome my anxiety again and so those are the top 10 results of what people are actually searching for in our area so it's not just us but guess what we're human beings we're human beings so we're affected by this the same as anybody else see because your flesh is no more saved than any other flesh and we need to disabuse ourselves of the notion that when we receive the Holy Ghost somehow we become some type of Superman and Super women that were able to just fly from other clouds the Holy Ghost is what gives you the ability to overcome the ability to fight but then you still got to overcome you still gotta fight he wants Sons and Daughters he don't want Angels If he if he wanted Angels he'd just let the Angels do it but he wants Sons and Daughters of God who've overcome something have been through something have character in their lives so these are things we all deal with at some point in our lives I'm not going to preach on those things because brother random when he preached how can I overcome he stops it there he doesn't say how can I overcome this or that or the other because the things the tools that he gave us and how can I overcome was actually telling us what we could overcome no matter what it was he's telling us how to overcome it not what to overcome if there's some things that we fight as I begin to think about it there's some things that are specific to 2023 maybe they didn't fight in 1963 but they fight we fight on today and yet the the antidote for it the formula for uh for overcoming it is still the same we we fight a great religious deception of course they did then but it's just gotten worse in in the world that we live in there's religious deception even even in a Messengers religious deception we fight that we fight bad attitudes we should say sinful attitudes influenced by and expressed on social media right right we fight that we fight soft living somebody said amen he said is this a Wednesday night brother Ben or a Sunday morning well but all of us do I'm not particularly directing this to this little crowd sitting here tonight I'm talking about all of us we fight soft living which makes us unwilling to resist the devil because of difficulty we fight over stimulation by entertainment even our children fight that we hand them one of these and and they become overstimulated so they can't sit in church and and all children have a problem sitting in church but it makes it even harder if they're on this all the time have a hard time sitting still we fight adults fight over stimulation by entertainment if you've always got something in front of you you always have to have something in front of you and the thing is what did stimulate you won't stimulate you in the in the future and so what happens if you're overstimulated by entertainment many times with men that leads and sometimes with women as well but especially with men that leads to boredom which leads to infidelity or sexual sin we fight that huh we fight that brother Branham had the cross in his car for a reason I have to fight that you have to fight that come on church not a bunch of angels we fight that and we better fight it or if we don't fight it we've given into it we fight a casual attitude towards the things of God we talked about that on Sunday he said but brother Ben I have the Holy Ghost but that's wonderful but as I said you're empowered now to overcome in John 1 and 12 but as many as received him to them that's to us today to them gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe in his name not that you weren't always in the seed of sun but that seed had to be expressed as a son or a daughter of God see you you have to fight and become come to your position you've been given power to do that Romans 13 and 14 but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof so you are a Christian but you got to put on the Lord Jesus Christ Galatians 5 16 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh First Corinthians 10 12 wherefore let him to think if he stand and take heed lest he fall I remember many years ago I came when I was pastoring I think in bransville when I was very young I came and heard Aaron McGarry preaching this Pulpit many years ago and he stood here and he used that scripture and he said it was after a youth camp and the youth had gone to Louisiana he preached on Wednesday night I'll never forget what he said he said that scripture wherefore let him think of these stand to take take heed lest he fall he said he'd have to be standing in order to fall so it's not something just thinks they stand but somebody that that thinks they're okay right they're standing but they fall who is that a Christian but thank God you can get back up as a Christian you will get back up it's always stuck with me brother Brandon was asked the question is it possible for a holy ghost-filled person to be influenced to do minor things he doesn't want to do and he answers that and he says you're right in the place then to be drove by those things you just put yourself up a Target in first John 4 and 4 here he says you're of God Little Children how many believe that tonight you are of God in other words you're the seed of God you have the Holy Ghost you've been born again and have overcome them because why have you overcome them the greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world it's not that he that is in the world is not fighting you but it's because see that's in you is greater or aren't you glad for that tonight he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world so how do we overcome in 2023 is this okay tonight I I trust that it is the same way they did 60 years ago which as I was studying this I didn't realize that in two days it'll be the 60th anniversary of this sermon he preached it on August 25th in 1963. we fight it the same way that God's people have always overcome now brother Branham when he when he goes into this and takes the scriptures and things he begins to bring out some points and I don't have time if the sermon's about two hours long if you go and listen to it do you good to listen to it I I know that it would it's just a it's just a blessing to help you and give you the tools to overcome but I just want to draw some things out of there tonight if I could and then and then we'll let you go home I won't hold you too long tonight but the first thing that brother Branham begins to address and this is by no means all that he addresses but he begins to address he said you've got to keep life in you if you want to overcome keep life in you keep the Life of Christ he talks about a log in the water and how that that law when it's in the water he said I I was out walking across the stream and I've actually done this where you're walking across the stream and you see a log that's in the water but you don't want to get wet so you step on the log where you're going to get wet because if it's been in there very long it's been cut off from the Life Source and so the log is becoming Dody which is the word it means it's beginning to crumble it's beginning to get old that word don't you hear Brother Brown music in the token as well it speaks of a person as they get older and they begin to lose some of their mental faculties they begin to lose some of their strength and some you know we you may be getting older in body but our experience with God should never get Doty it should never get to a place where we're about to well there's just a there's nothing worse than a bunch of uh uh Funeral Home Christians and and a dead Theology and a dead Christianity or a dead message religion something that's just it just doesn't actually do anything for them it has the form of a law but you can't walk you it won't do nothing that's no life in it God help us from becoming that you're not save us from becoming that we want to have life even on a Wednesday night there's got to be life there there's got to be a passion there to serve God there's got to be a strength there to overcome the enemy yeah so he said if you want to overcome keep life in you overcome keep life in you when life went out he said that's what brought that log to that condition and it made it worse than ever when it laid it in the branch where the water was that's a sobering thought but going to church he said I attend church and I want you to attend church I want you to be here every service if you can but you need to be more than a church attender because a church attender without the Life of Christ actually rots faster than someone who doesn't attend church because he says then he said you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and the experience the joy of serving Christ Living in a church where such is going on now watch he's living in a church where the presence of God is there the spirit of God is there they preach the truth he's living in a church but he has no life so instead of the water feeding the tree when it was planted by the rivers of water the tree pushed shout and blossomed and bore fruit but now it's laying in the water and because it's only laying in the water it has no life in it it begins to be destroyed by the water itself because it takes a religious spirit and there's no Spirit harder to break than a religious spirit I say God take the religious spirit away from us let us be real Christians let us be real men and women of God there's nothing worse than a message more there's nothing worse than a than a denominational more no matter what kind of more what names on the building there's nothing worse than some place where the life of God is no longer there God help us we would never be that huh you say Well I'm I must not have had anything maybe you just let the life of God get out of you you know it's possible but brother Brandon says when you have a certain kind of attitude a certain kind of uh you do certain things said that you'll fly up because he won't leave you we flapping the Gable end of your soul it's an interesting way to put it isn't it what happens the influence of the Holy Ghost leaves you and he leaves you to your own for a little bit because if you're a real Christian you can't live that way you'll come back you'll come back he said you let the life and live in a church such is going on he rottens twice as quick right living right under he said so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly someone say constantly constantly in the Life of Christ because if you don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the Bible said he that knows to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin then you become Doty there's that word again Dodie rotten when you're separated from the life of God so strive with all that's in you to stay in the Life of Christ can we do that tonight let's strive with all that's in us to stay in the life that you would be fruit bearing see Paul puts it this way he said you're running a race he said we're foreseen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us he's talking about Christians let us run with patience the race that is set before us oh aren't you glad he's giving you the ability to run let's run it with patience stay in the race save the race don't sit down you say well I'm hurting don't sit down your muscles are hurt your spiritual muscles you'll feel like sitting down you'll feel like giving up but stay in the race even if you have to walk even if you have to shuffle even if you if you can't barely put One Foot In Front Of Another stay in the race if you don't have the joy that you did have the peace that you did have you said I remember when I got saved what it was like brother remember said today so you should be closer to God today than you ever were God help me to be like that the peace that you didn't have the Zeal that you'd have do something about it right don't just accept it was just the way I am right now what can you do you can do something go back where you left it how many people have how many times have I seen people they begin to get out of church and speak mostly it's because they decided to put something in front of Christ something in their life came in front of God the word and then they backslid how do you get back go take care of that go start putting God first and then you begin to see God move again in your life church I'm not I'm not hollering at you tonight you that are here on a Wednesday night during the school year man you're you you all are heroes but stay in the race I'm just encouraging you number two the second tool that he gives us and tells us of how to overcome get in the ark get in the ark he talks about Noah he says think hard now if you're laying around getting Doty get in hurry quick because the door might close at any time and there's always been an ark in God's economy there was an ark in the days of Noah for the savings of his people it was an ark in the days of the law Arc of testimony in the days of the law they followed the ark and there is a third dispensation now like Noah's time lost time now this time there's an ark now and that Ark is not a denomination neither neither is the good works that you do it's by one Spirit Romans 8 1 we were all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by Holy Ghost baptism he said that's the oh he said well he didn't preach that after the seals this is after the seals he said that's the only way you overcome it's all that is under the shed blood is Overcomers he said you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you you're resting what does that mean it means you're in the ark get in the ark What We should strive to do the Bible tells us to strive to enter into rest that seems like an oxymoron while I work to get into rest what what does that mean you know it's the same as if you're but I was gonna be talking about finances if you're building you know what are you doing you're working hard now so you don't have to work so hard later you're striving to enter into rest and once you enter into rest then you can rest but we are resting but we're striving to stay there are you with me now that's the thing just that you can't you can't do it on your own he said brother Ben I've tried for years to overcome cigarettes I understand uh what a horrible Demon I've seen people be they'd be able to give up drugs they'd be able to give up hard drugs they still can't give up cigarettes it's a hard thing but strive to enter in you're gonna have to you're gonna have to care about it you're gonna have to seek God for it because that thing will kill you if you keep doing it oh but how do you overcome you can't do that by just mentally thinking well I'm going to get rid of these cigarettes I'm gonna get rid of these cigarettes no strive to enter into the word get close to God get so close to God you don't want them cigarettes no more get so fulfilled with the Holy Ghost until the Holy Spirit cleanses you from that thing are you with me now he said so you can't just do it because I'm gonna quit smoking I'm gonna quit drinking get in the life strive to enter in get in the ark he said how how will I know then brother Brown that I'm in there isn't this good he said watch what kind of a life you're living just look around see if it just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull you said see then you're doing it all right but don't try to do it I love that you use the example of a baby putting on a coat all right if we took one of these little one-year-olds two-year-olds to find well maybe maybe she's old enough my little niece back there if she's she's probably old enough to put on her own coat probably wants to but you take one about one year old and they try to put on their own coat to go out that's frustrating man trying to watch that what do you do you pick them up brother Brown said you got them with gentle hands into the coat that's what we want here's a coat of the word we need to put it on here's the dress that God gave us to be dressed in let's Let The Gentle hands of Jehovah the holy spirit guide us into the arms of that coat he said now don't struggle not him that willeth or him that runeth but God just say God just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he promised he would deliver you from those things he is able to perform not joining one denomination another denomination running this side or the other trying this just yield yourself to God walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him hallelujah it's everyday faith how could I overcome in 2023 expect to be tested that's part of overcoming is learning that test is coming trials are coming you're going to get knocked around a little bit people are going to disappoint you you're going to have disappointing things happen to you and many times you're going to be like you're going to be like Joseph when he went down before he went up Harry was headed he knew what his future was it's been revealed to him by a dream but he had to go into the prison before he could go to the king's Palace sometimes that's the way we have to go we've got to many times God will allow something to happen to us and just knock us off our feet we say why did he do that because he's got something better for you that's why we should never get a bad an ill temper or upset about something that happens or decisions that are made Let's just let God sort it out it'll be okay it'll be okay well my boss they did this out of the other my employer did they said it'll be okay it's going to be okay why because the one that loves you is taking care of you is looking out for you if you if you don't want you to have that job he'll make sure you don't have it something better is waiting for you right so expect to be tested first Peter 4 and 12 beloved take it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you First Corinthians 10 13 there hath no temptation taking you but such is this common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you I love this to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it he didn't say make it easy but he said make a way to escape if you go back in the original there it's the image of of uh of a man in the ocean he's been Shipwrecked but he's he's swimming and he knows if he can swim long enough he can see the shore there's always a way of Escape amen and that is by the Cross of Christ he always makes a way of Escape and we have to have faith to believe that now but the Reynolds that we're expecting to be tested either coming to God must first be tested tested what with the word that's God's test he said Do you believe it either coming to God must be tested he said that only shows a true child then be tested you can't overcome unless there's a test given to you and when test is given is to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you it's hard to see why you're in the test it's hard to see maybe for some years after the death but one day you're going to look back and you're going to say by the bill the test that I went through what's the greatest thing that ever happened to me amen it's a testing time it's one good evidence he said if God loved me he wouldn't put me through that no the test itself is evidence that God is with us when we are tested for all children of God our tested and tried number four I don't have very long so I got to hurry through these don't look back if you want to overcome don't look back brother Branham talks about how the people left Creeds and dogma's denominations to follow the revealed truth and many of us have left that but I think our young people maybe we haven't left Creeds and denominations but we left we leave behind a life of sin so the imagery still works we come out of bondage we leave our old life and come into Christ and maybe your life of sin wasn't as big or as fancy as somebody else's but thank God for that but you still left the old man come to the new man right you had something to overcome and so so but you don't look back he said well lot's life did the same thing you know she set out to go with lot follow her husband her children or loved ones but it wasn't in her heart now notice that's why I followed her husband her children her loved ones she didn't follow because she believed it she followed because it was them but because she didn't really believe it it wasn't in her heart she turned around and looked back oh my she never overcome he said she still loved the world she never never won big long last look that's where she got caught he said don't even look back don't have no desires keep going could I encourage you tonight keep going little bride keep going there's a there's a goal out there for you to reach keep going amen there's something ahead of you much better than what you're going through right now there's a land over there that's much better than this land well I'm so glad for that if Paul said if in this life only I had confidence or peace with God he said I am of all men most miserable if this is the only life I believed in he said I am of all men most miserable but he's sitting in a jail cell jailed up but he said I have peace and joy because for me to live is Christ but to die is gain I'm going to a better land I'm going to a better place you got to get a vision of that and believe that in order to make it through the trials of life in order to overcome he said don't even look back don't desire to put your mind on Calvary keep moving towards Christ Paul says that this way in Hebrews 10 39 we are not of them who draw back into perdition can somebody say Amen that tonight because if we say Amen to that we are not of them you put your name there Benjamin Pruitt is not of them who draw back in the prediction I am not one who rejects the message I'm not one who makes it almost all the way and then leaves at the end I don't care what happens between now and then but I'm going home why that's where I came from I'm going back where I came from I'm not going to a strange place I'm going to a place where there was a thought of God before the foundation of the world thought of God's coming home no matter what has to happen in the meantime are you with me now we're not of them that go back but of them that believe to the saving of the soul but the brown said not he that starts he that finishes many start to race but there's one finishing him there'll be many churches start many groups of people but there will be one group finished that's the Overcomers Hallelujah number five be like Reverend Mr Lily you remember the story Reverend Mr Lilly who was Reverend Mr Lilly you kids you kids if you don't know that story go listen to how can I overcome brother man talks about it Reverend Mr Lilly he said it was a lily was was planted in the muck it's planting the bottom of a pond he said they built the Tabernacle there over a Lily Pond what had been a Lily Pond and he said it down in the middle of that and down in that muck that that seed sinks all the way down till it can't even see the light but somehow in the spring of the year there's just enough warmth even though that seed maybe the direct light never reaches that sea but it warms the dirt around the seed Hallelujah and you oh my you've experienced that this is the dirt around the seed this is the muck and the mud and the mire that the seed had to get through so Reverend Mr Lilly was planted there in the in the in the bottom of the pond but he comes up through the muck and up to the mire and up through the different levels of dirt and he comes up and he pokes his head up above but he's not finished yet because he's not going to live in the water he's going to live in the presence of the Sun so he pushes his way up until he gets above the water above the mud above the muck above the dirt above the stone above everything everybody tries to pile on it amen he pushes his way up why there's a seed there that's going to produce what God meant for it to be amen he overcome but the Bible said that's the Overcomer he overcome the mud he overcome the things of the world and now he freely gives himself out everybody can look at him his life you can't put a finger on it but he didn't start that way listen Church don't don't get don't get nervous don't get upset don't worry he said well brother Ben we haven't started well I I just got married and we're having problems sir we just I'm a young person I'm having problems we all did huh all of us did some of us that didn't well you said well I didn't have any problems well they'll come later they just haven't pushed yourself up to the muck yet there's going to be problems in life there's going to be things you have to overcome but you overcome if you have overcome great things you've overcome great difficulty but you but you get to a place where you can look at their life you say you can't put a finger on it but Danny Ward wasn't always Danny Ward right Mark Crowder wasn't always Mark Crowder you you men and women that are sitting here tonight you weren't always sister Patty wasn't always sister Patty you had you were something else at some point but God had to make you what you are Amen in order to be a giver in order to be somebody who's a help to the church in order to be somebody who's a who's a a net positive to the body of Christ there had to be many setbacks but you pushing your way up he said he's a real Overcomer you can't say nothing about him now huh so you come out of the mud but he's not in the mud now Lord God oh I love it he come out of the mud he's not in the mud now he's on top of it Hallelujah you can't then point back to what he was what is he now he's on top then the bee comes by and said that's wonderful perfume I believe I'll go and get my part he just opens up his heart says come on now Hallelujah all right everything takes from him see he's a he's a real Pastor I love this he expresses the glory of God if he calls him Reverend Mr Lily he expresses the glory of God look where he come from he had to overcome to do that one time now watch what some of us have to overcome some of us one time he or she was young and fair and beautiful one time but brother Harvey I have overcome that all of us all of us trying to get back what we were I am too it alarms me I'm trying to lose weight you know and I was trying to get back where we were but one time see he or she was young and fair and beautiful they had a lot of Temptations to go through but they overcome that I love that they overcome now they're maybe not so young and fair and beautiful but they're steady they're solid more ways than just one you ain't gonna move them it's steadfast Paul says unmovable why they come up through the mud but they got on top of it amen they've been through trials and battles but they didn't stay there come up that's the key overcoming depression anxiety all those things that we all those things God's doing something in your life just climb over it yeah maybe maybe feel like swimming in mud ask a preacher the other night what was I was preaching liking he said it was like walking through mud I said well you know it's hard when you don't get any amens but I'm glad we have an amen in church I'm glad I'm not talking about y'all but but you know that's what it's like sometimes when you get depressed and you get down and you begin to get anxiety it's like walking through mud but keep putting your feet between One Foot In Front Of Another because you're called to overcome that you're gonna be on top one of these days and if you realize that it won't take you under how can I overcome be like Reverend Mr Lily oh we overcome he said Reverend Mr Billy overcome through humility by humility so to Jesus let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus he overcome the mud the flesh see the seed of God I love the fact that God amorphed himself into a seed brother Brown said all that God was become a seed foreign an embryo we could say it like that in the womb of of Mary he poured himself into Christ and in doing that he took on mud oh it's hard to hear about Jesus but it's true yes sir that's why he could have headaches that's why he could be tempted he took on a flesh body flesh like our flesh only he did no sin I got to preach on that one day the difference what's the difference because there's sin in there's original sin that he he did no sin but he wasn't tied to the original sin he was virgin born so that he could overcome so we can overcome so by living in the Life of Christ what are you doing you're overcoming your first birth he was in the form of God and thought it not Robert to be equal with God but made himself with no reputation took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men that men is flesh being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross that's random deals with that a lot more but that's the way to overcome is by humility number six recognize the devil in every one of his tricks right that's how brother random defines overcoming he said his overcoming is recognizing the devil and every one of his tricks a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil just as real as you are anybody real devil you must recognize him real you must know he's the devil then at the same time you recognize him and know that he's the Devil he's against you and to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that's what David recognizes Goliath right and and that's the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that he said then no you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he said then you realize that you've overcome he said and you know that he's the devil you can't say I got a sickness I don't believe it is a sickness oh yes it is a sickness you've got cancer you don't believe it's cancer it is cancer he said but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him you see the weakest light overpowers the greatest Darkness I could turn all the lights out in this room and I could have one little flashlight or the light off of my iPad or my phone and I can shine and you can see it because the weakest light overpowers the greatest Darkness you know what happens with Darkness we ever thought about that what happens to the darkness light literally wallows up Darkness do you know that scientifically light swallows up light particles Hallelujah swallow up the darkness the darkness doesn't have to do anything to be there it's just there you realize that Darkness you don't have to create Darkness turn off all the lights and that's what you get right no nobody could create oh my darkness is just the absence of light but what the light does is it literally the light particles swallow up the darkness death is swallowed up in Victory that's the one that's in you it's life and the one that's in the world is Darkness so the light has proved to overcome the darkness and the man that's in Christ and knows that he's overcome the things of the world it has no more ties to you at all you're free walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin we have Fellowship one with another do you believe that tonight remember seven this is the last one don't listen to The Devil's proposition very good Satan's always going to be giving you ideas you know that that's why we don't that's why we don't preach everything comes in our minds let me back it up with the word because everything that comes in your mind that's why if you're going to not use notes you better be really in the spirit all right you can do that I've seen preachers do that wonderfully without any notes at all just the spirit of the Lord catch them just like that and I've also seen people that get in the flesh just start hammering people because they didn't have any Direction they didn't study his brother Andrew said you said you didn't study and they said we can tell huh but now but we study I appreciate these young men doing that taking time when they're working and things I know how hard that is I did it for many years and but but Satan's got a proposition for you if he can give it to the preacher he will if you can give it to you he will sometimes Satan can take you when you think you're doing the will of God can make you a proposition you'll fall for it he said let's take for instance like our sisters they're pretty he can get you to a place if you let your hair grow out you didn't realize it looked so nice on you and the first thing you know you get kind of feeling a little stuck up a little above something else he said some of you men you know what I mean well not me because I've never been proud of my hair maybe we get proud of something else for the bill get a little money a little prestige a little standing we get lifted up with the brown said a pastor get lifted up by the people until he thinks he can do anything get by with it God help us today he said he can take the same thing he said you get kind of feeling stuck up he can some of you men he said you take that same thing and proposition it with you I tried he said you've got to overcome that right just remember you're living for God you have one objective and that's Jesus Christ outside of that there's nothing else counts that's him he said then secondly for your family thirdly for yourself first for God next your family and next for you so anytime you make a decision say first for God next for your family third for you I tell you when you become a help to the churches when you start putting your church family in with your family that's when you really become a help to the body thirdly for yourself first for God then your family next for you your number three that's the end of the road put yourself last he did amen I'm glad he did we got we'll take these things seriously let's be rugged Christians and fight to live in this land where all the promises like musicians go ahead and come I a little bit over my time one minute brother Joe one minute a soldier is not confident in his weapons his weapons will fail he's not confident in them if he's not confident in his support he'll hesitate you know that they say the biggest thing biggest reason soldiers get killed in armies that are not well trained is because they hesitate because many times they're hidden right and if you're carrying a bazooka I don't know what shoulder you carry a bazooka on but if you're carrying a bazooka and you've got a bazooka probably the other one you get a bazooka out there and you got it trained on an enemy tank but now two things are going to happen like you can take out the tank but if you do your position is exposed right so in order to take out the tank to do what you what you've been trained to do you've got to expose yourself so you've got to have confidence in the people behind you and the ones standing with you you're not going to do it and that's the way many people are with overcoming they hesitate that's why well-trained armies just a few well-trained men can overcome many many hundreds of of people that are not well trained because they hesitate they don't want to get shot I mean if we fail to overcome because we think well if I attack that I don't have the ability or the strength to overcome it if it comes back at me but don't you realize who's on your side don't you realize those angels are encamped around about you don't you realize the Holy Ghost is inside of you don't you realize that the church is behind you the people of God all of Heaven is behind you you're an overcomer all that are in Christ are Overcomers oh my we are Overcomers in this age what was it the Old Testament Saints raised with him brother said and the New Testament Saints are risen with him they raised with improving they were Overcomers we are raised with him from dead trespassers and sins proving that we are Overcomers you're an overcomer it's time we begin to act like it pick up our bazooka and start taking out some enemy tanks take out doubt take out unbelief take out all of them whatever you've been struggling with to overcome take it out get rid of it deal with it relationship don't have to continue to be like that that that that ungodliness doesn't have to be there deal with it Let It Go Isaac Watts wrote this and I'll let Alan sing but he said must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas sure I must fight if I would Reign increase my courage Lord I'll bear the toil endure the pain supported by Thy word there's some lesser known verses he said thy Saints in all this glorious War shall conquer though they die they see the Triumph from afar by face Discerning Eye when that illustrious day shall rise and all thy armies shine in Robes of Victory through the skies the glory shall be thine do you believe that today amen God bless you tonight brother Alan just come and lead us in in a little bit of worship before we go do you love him I didn't mean to keep you long on a Wednesday night but don't you want to be an overcomer amen God bless
