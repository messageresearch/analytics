[45:10] said and last of all he was seen of me
[45:12] also as of one born out of due time this
[45:15] is Paul speaking the
[45:18] Apostle I am the least of the Apostles
[45:21] I'm not meat to be called an apostle
[45:24] because I persecuted the Church of God
[45:28] by the grace of God I am what I am how
[45:32] many can say Amen to that tonight by the
[45:35] grace of God his grace which was
[45:38] bestowed upon me was not in vain but I
[45:41] labored more abundantly than they all
[45:44] yet not I but the grace of God which was
[45:47] with me amen I pray the Lord would add
[45:50] his Blessing to the word you may be
[45:53] seated what we discovered last time
[45:56] without doing too much reviewed tonight
[45:59] that the new birth is the revelation of
[46:01] Jesus Christ personally to you it's the
[46:06] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[46:09] you we found that uh Peter got a
[46:12] revelation of who he was of who Jesus
[46:14] was and then later Peter got a
[46:16] revelation of who Jesus was in Peter and
[46:20] when he got that Revelation it was the
[46:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the new
[46:25] birth in Peter's life Jesus Jesus told
[46:27] him when you're converted strengthen
[46:29] your brethren and so that's what it
[46:31] takes for us to be born again I'll just
[46:34] read that part to you again brother
[46:35] brand said the new birth is Christ is a
[46:39] revelation God has revealed to you this
[46:42] great mystery and that's a new birth

[46:56] of who Christ is not the group that goes
[46:59] to a certain church or the group that
[47:01] has a certain Pastor or the group that
[47:03] dresses a certain way or the group that
[47:06] does this side or the other but the
[47:07] group that has the revelation of who
[47:11] Jesus is today that group that has that
[47:14] Revelation where the Revelation is
[47:16] perfectly in Harmony and God expressing
[47:19] it perfect it through his word by the
[47:21] same actions the same things that he did
[47:25] making the word manifest
[47:27] he said oh if the church only knew its
[47:32] position oh my heart cries with the
[47:34] prophet tonight as he it come from his
[47:37] heart he said oh if the church only knew
[47:39] its position it will one day it will one
[47:42] day that's a promise I believe this is
[47:45] the day that the church recognizes its
[47:48] position because we have to for a
[47:50] Rapture he said then he said the Rapture
[47:52] will go when it knows what it is the
[47:56] Rapture will go we talked about that he
[47:58] didn't say the Rapture will come but the
[48:00] Rapture will go because everything you
[48:03] have need of for the Rapture is in you
[48:05] right now oh if you can just realize who
[48:08] you are tonight and what's going to
[48:11] happen to you
[48:13] now and and brother brandom goes on he
[48:16] said and and this is just a continuation
[48:18] of that thought but he said did you
[48:21] notice Paul never knew Jesus physically
[48:24] right Paul never knew Jesus physically
[48:28] the only way that Paul knew him was by
[48:30] Revelation by a
[48:32] vision it was by a revelation by a
[48:35] vision is that right Paul only knew
[48:37] Jesus by the Revelation just like Peter
[48:40] did Peter had seen him in flesh but he
[48:43] didn't know him by flesh so Paul hadn't
[48:46] seen him in the flesh and didn't know
[48:48] him by the flesh Peter had seen him in
[48:51] the flesh but still didn't know him by
[48:53] the flesh cuz he said Flesh and Blood
[48:55] didn't reveal it to even my own life
[48:59] didn't reveal it to you now I want you
[49:02] to know this Revelation doesn't come by
[49:04] observation you can find Jesus teaching
[49:07] that in Luke 17: 20 if you want to write
[49:09] that down but he talks to them the
[49:11] Pharisees he said the kingdom of God
[49:13] doesn't come by what you
[49:15] see he said you won't be able to see it
[49:17] it could be right among you and you
[49:19] wouldn't see it he said because the
[49:20] kingdom of God is within you so the
[49:24] kingdom of God does not come by
[49:27] observation you won't be able to set a
[49:30] come by a set of rules or or this is
[49:32] what the church will be this is what
[49:34] this is what the person will be it don't
[49:36] come by observation the kingdom of God
[49:39] is within you no amount of observing The
[49:42] Life of Christ will give you a
[49:44] revelation of who he
[49:46] is they could have been raised with him
[49:49] uh they could have lived with him they
[49:50] could have worked with him but it would
[49:52] never reveal who he
[49:54] was oh my you can go to church church
[49:57] you can pay your tithe you can live
[49:58] right you can do everything right but it
[50:01] takes a
[50:02] revelation of Grace by grace for you to
[50:06] be saved and for me to be saved and I'm
[50:09] so glad of that tonight it does not come
[50:13] by observation in other words you can't
[50:16] just observe it you can't he said even
[50:18] my own life didn't reveal to you could
[50:20] know everything brother random ever did
[50:22] and try to pattern your life according
[50:24] to the prophet and it would never do you
[50:27] any good other than just as a leader as
[50:30] a mentor but that's not going to get you
[50:31] into heaven what's going to get you into
[50:34] heaven a revelation of who he is right
[50:36] now you got to know who he is in you and
[50:39] who he is in your brother and sister to
[50:42] have a revelation today which is the new
[50:45] birth now but it doesn't come even by
[50:47] observing your brother and sister right
[50:50] yeah right you could watch them you
[50:52] could watch two people they could both
[50:54] do the same things say the same things
[50:58] claim to believe the same things one of
[51:01] them has a revelation and one doesn't
[51:03] but it proves out in the end who they
[51:06] are the wheat and The Tear grow up
[51:07] together now he said but my Father which
[51:10] is in heaven has revealed the thing to
[51:12] you that he is the word of God and Upon
[51:16] This Rock I'll build my church Peter
[51:19] didn't know him by flesh man walked and
[51:22] handled him and everything else but he
[51:25] said Paul had something greater than any
[51:28] of the Apostles
[51:29] did and watch Paul had a greater
[51:32] Revelation even though he never met him
[51:35] now he said they said well I've got more
[51:37] Revelation than you Paul because you
[51:38] know I walked with him I went fishing
[51:42] with him one day I heard him
[51:46] talk right that brother brand said
[51:48] people die Spirits never
[51:49] die right that's still around
[51:52] today he said well he sat in the boat
[51:55] with me and actually told me let's go
[51:59] over here and fish in this place and
[52:00] we'll get more fish and we did it see we
[52:03] seen him do
[52:04] things but just being there and seeing
[52:07] the supernatural happen is not enough to
[52:10] give you a
[52:12] revelation right but what what gives you
[52:15] a revelation is
[52:17] Grace because you are God's because
[52:20] you're one of his children that's why
[52:22] you have a revelation tonight is because
[52:24] you belong to Heaven you come come from
[52:27] somewhere and you're going back to
[52:30] somewhere are you with me so far so Paul
[52:33] had something greater than the apostles
[52:36] did they said well we've done this that
[52:38] and the other and we saw him do this
[52:41] that and the other but that wasn't
[52:42] enough hearing the voice of Jesus was
[52:46] not what saved
[52:48] Paul he never heard his voice in the
[52:50] flesh he heard it from the pillar of
[52:53] fire right but he never heard his voice
[52:55] in the flesh I I would contend to you
[52:58] today that hearing the voice of the
[52:59] Prophet will not save
[53:01] you and in some places that we've been
[53:04] in the world we know there's places
[53:06] where they can't hear the voice of a
[53:07] prophet where they don't understand the
[53:09] voice of a prophet and that has no
[53:12] saving value in it but it's what that
[53:14] it's the message that that Prophet
[53:16] brought it's the message it's the
[53:18] Revelation that doesn't come from the
[53:21] voice of a man but it comes from the
[53:22] voice of God it's the words that he
[53:25] spoke it's the words that Jesus spoke
[53:27] that's what matter he said that's what
[53:29] my words are spirit and life so Paul saw
[53:33] him after he was dead the brown said
[53:35] buried rose again and expressed himself
[53:37] in the pillar of fire that led the
[53:39] children of Israel Paul being a Jew
[53:41] would have never called that Lord unless
[53:44] he had seen the expression he was back
[53:47] the same yesterday today and forever he
[53:50] was back what does that tell us if we've
[53:53] seen the pillar of fire today if we've
[53:55] seen it you say well I haven't seen it
[53:57] you've seen the picture of it I believe
[53:59] there's a reason why God allowed his
[54:00] picture to be taken in this hour because
[54:03] you've at least seen the picture of the
[54:05] supernatural Pillar of Fire that doesn't
[54:08] save you but what it does is tell you
[54:10] he's
[54:11] back right the same God that was here in
[54:15] the old times is still here today the
[54:17] same God that was with Moses the same
[54:19] God that was with Paul that same God
[54:21] that was with brother brandom is still
[54:22] here today how many believe that today
[54:26] so he said Paul in other words I'm the
[54:28] same God today I was yesterday here I am
[54:31] in the same light the pillar of fire
[54:33] that Moses talked to in the burning bush
[54:35] no wonder he could separate the law From
[54:36] Grace over in the book of Hebrews now
[54:38] keep that in your mind he met that same
[54:41] Pillar of Fire he said I am Jesus whom
[54:43] you persecute and here he is today in
[54:46] the same manner by the same Pillar of
[54:49] Fire expressing himself and vindicating
[54:52] himself the same revealing the mystery
[54:54] of God has been hid since the foundation
[54:58] of the
[54:59] world oh my so Paul only knew him by
[55:03] Revelation Peter knew him by Revelation
[55:06] Paul only knew him by Revelation now
[55:09] Peter walked with him talked with him
[55:11] brother BR said therefore you can set in
[55:13] this word now remember he was the word
[55:17] just knowing the word as far as knowing
[55:19] what it says doesn't save
[55:23] you right because he said you you can
[55:26] sit in this word he said now I've just
[55:29] said that he was the word now a scholar
[55:31] can sit down and read that word till he
[55:33] can just tie your mind up anyway see if
[55:35] he wants to do it cuz he's smart
[55:36] brilliant get a Catholic priest or not
[55:39] so much as that a real good trained
[55:40] Theologian in the Bible a Baptist or a
[55:43] presbyterian or something he'll make you
[55:44] think you don't know nothing when it
[55:46] comes to
[55:49] talk see that we don't we don't want to
[55:51] get to a place where all we know is talk
[55:54] the B of the church got to a place where
[55:55] it's only weapon was argument I don't
[55:57] want to ever get to that place but I
[56:00] want to know him by Revelation I want to
[56:02] know him by experience I want to know
[56:04] him in the reality of who he
[56:07] is they knew him he said they they'll
[56:10] tie you up where you don't know nothing
[56:11] when it comes to talk why what see he
[56:13] said because he has known him in the
[56:15] flesh the word and he he Pats his Bible
[56:18] so knowing him in the flesh the brand
[56:20] typed that to knowing him in the Bible
[56:22] only yeah in the letter only he said but
[56:24] the only way you're saved
[56:26] is by know him by
[56:29] Revelation right know him by Revelation
[56:33] it's got to become a reality to you see
[56:36] by the word by knowing him by the flesh
[56:38] you can know he
[56:40] died right but you got to have a
[56:42] revelation he died for
[56:44] you right so when we're talking about
[56:46] Revelation we're not talking about
[56:48] understanding or levels of understanding
[56:51] or being able to explain things in the
[56:53] message that's not what I'm talking
[56:54] about I'm talking about revelation I'm
[56:56] talking about you knowing it being a
[56:58] settled fact all right that he died for
[57:01] you not saying what my dad told me my
[57:04] mom told me the the pastor told me
[57:06] somebody else told me but I know see
[57:10] this message has got to become more than
[57:11] just something we've been beat over the
[57:13] head with it's got to be something more
[57:15] than something we've just been fed force
[57:17] fed over and over and over again but
[57:19] it's got to be something that you
[57:20] settled in your heart that you said I
[57:23] know other people can say what they want
[57:25] to but I know brother Jeff this message
[57:27] is right I know it and so you couldn't
[57:30] draw me away from it you couldn't pull
[57:31] me off of it because I know it's a
[57:34] revelation it's not I think or someone
[57:36] told me but I
[57:38] know that's what Peter said I know you
[57:41] are the Christ and once I have that
[57:43] Revelation I might even fail Peter even
[57:46] denied him but after he had that
[57:48] Revelation he could never leave he could
[57:51] never fall so far that the grace of God
[57:53] wouldn't pick him up why because he knew
[57:55] that was the Christ
[57:56] and you know that this message is right
[57:59] you know him you know the word not just
[58:01] the letter of it but you know that that
[58:03] word is
[58:05] real
[58:06] Hallelujah the
[58:08] Revelation brand said I can take the
[58:11] Presbyterian Doctrine tie you
[58:12] Pentecostals till you won't know I can
[58:14] take the Baptist Doctrine and show you
[58:16] Pentecostals a million things you'll
[58:17] know nothing of that's right but that's
[58:19] not it that's not his
[58:23] church huh he repeats it that's not his
[58:25] church yeah yeah his church is
[58:28] himself
[58:32] revealed and whatever he did the church
[58:35] will
[58:36] do
[58:38] and brother B taught us about that we
[58:41] believe the signs of Wonders follow the
[58:42] church right those that
[58:44] believe but that's not what we what we
[58:47] do first is we make sure that the fruits
[58:50] of the spirit are operating in our
[58:52] lives that's love joy peace
[58:57] longsuffering gentleness kindness amen
[59:00] because that is him expressing himself
[59:03] in the church yes see you could do a lot
[59:06] of things and say I'm a Believer and I
[59:10] belong to the church and I believe the
[59:11] message but is that coming is that
[59:14] emanating from your life is the is is
[59:17] the nature of Christ
[59:19] himself expressing himself the way he
[59:23] did in the Bible through your life or is
[59:26] there Envy jealousy right those other
[59:29] things that are are of the flesh those
[59:31] things that we have to overcome now
[59:32] watch his church is himself revealed you
[59:35] see it and expressed by the word itself
[59:40] that he is God now I want to I want to
[59:44] step away from Christ as the mystery of
[59:45] God revealed for a moment and and I want
[59:48] to ask you again how did Paul know
[59:52] Jesus well he knew him by revelation
[59:56] but what did he do to get that
[59:59] Revelation I want you to think about it
[1:00:02] I want you to don't answer me ably but
[1:00:04] just think about that what did he do to
[1:00:07] get that re Revelation well I would ask
[1:00:09] you what did Peter do to get that
[1:00:12] Revelation because Peter did just
[1:00:14] basically everything before Pentecost
[1:00:16] everything Peter did was
[1:00:18] wrong right he messed up in every
[1:00:20] possible way you can mess
[1:00:22] up in in what he was you know and so
[1:00:26] talking about this Peter I'm just
[1:00:27] talking about Peter in the
[1:00:30] Bible I know Peter feels like he messes
[1:00:32] up sometimes in every way but that's all
[1:00:34] of
[1:00:35] us but we don't know him by what we
[1:00:38] do right we don't know him by what we
[1:00:41] can
[1:00:43] perform you young people listen to me
[1:00:45] tonight you don't know him and because
[1:00:47] many times if it's performance-based
[1:00:49] you'll go out and you'll make a mistake
[1:00:52] and you'll think well I can't go back to
[1:00:53] church like that I I I done too much i'
[1:00:57] I've went too far don't you you don't
[1:00:58] know him that way you know him by
[1:01:02] Revelation right you know him by
[1:01:05] Revelation I I know him I know he's he's
[1:01:08] Grace to me and that Revelation does not
[1:01:11] come by by
[1:01:13] teaching it doesn't come by by by works
[1:01:17] it comes by Grace amen see it's a
[1:01:21] revelation of Grace by
[1:01:24] Grace amen
[1:01:26] now let me show you in Acts chapter 9
[1:01:28] let's look at how Paul if we just take a
[1:01:31] few minutes tonight and and kind of if I
[1:01:34] can kind of get my heart to you because
[1:01:36] I I just couldn't get away from this and
[1:01:38] so we just took a little bit out of
[1:01:39] Christ as the mystery but it spoke to me
[1:01:41] so much Acts chapter 9
[1:01:44] verse1 Saul yet breathing out
[1:01:46] threatenings and
[1:01:48] Slaughter against the Disciples of the
[1:01:50] Lord and went into the high priest now
[1:01:52] look at the type of man that Saul was
[1:01:55] who became Paul he was breathing out
[1:01:59] that that that's very descriptive it's
[1:02:01] saying he panted like a
[1:02:03] wolf to persecute people that's who he
[1:02:08] was he he was a wolf he was breathing
[1:02:12] out threats and Slaughter which is
[1:02:15] murder against the Disciples of the
[1:02:18] Lord Philippians 3:5 Paul says even of
[1:02:21] himself he said I was circumcised The
[1:02:23] Eighth Day the stalk of Israel the tribe
[1:02:25] of Benjamin Hebrew of the Hebrews that's
[1:02:28] touching the law of Pharisee sir and
[1:02:30] when he says that he said If any man
[1:02:32] could be proud of himself I could
[1:02:34] more right if any man could trust in
[1:02:36] himself I could more he said I had to
[1:02:38] count it all as done to be able to see
[1:02:41] Christ
[1:02:43] amen but see he was he was he was
[1:02:46] panting like a wolf because that was his
[1:02:48] nature and we've went through that The
[1:02:51] Tribe of Benjamin and my name is
[1:02:53] Benjamin but I don't have a Benjamin
[1:02:54] nature but the tribe of Benjamin is
[1:02:57] actually uh it was told of them that
[1:03:00] they would raven like a wolf that's
[1:03:01] Genesis
[1:03:02] 49:27 Benjamin shall Raven as a wolf in
[1:03:05] other words they would they would get a
[1:03:07] taste of blood a a and they couldn't
[1:03:11] quit
[1:03:13] killing right they get a taste of blood
[1:03:16] and they couldn't quit killing that's
[1:03:18] why if you get that in the church it's a
[1:03:21] problem right that that spirit that that
[1:03:24] Paul had before he became Paul when he
[1:03:26] was Saul he was he was actually a
[1:03:29] wolf and he he had a a taste for blood
[1:03:33] so he wasn't going to stop until he
[1:03:35] destroyed the people of God like a wolf
[1:03:38] or a stray dog or something if they ever
[1:03:40] get a taste they say if a dog ever gets
[1:03:41] a taste for chickens you're done you
[1:03:43] just have to shoot the dog right because
[1:03:46] if you have chickens because if he ever
[1:03:48] gets a taste of that it won't just it
[1:03:50] won't just kill a chicken to eat it
[1:03:51] it'll just keep killing if they ever
[1:03:53] they get excited by that blood like a
[1:03:55] shark get excited by the sin of blood
[1:03:57] they just killed to kill and that's the
[1:03:59] way Saul was he had tasted blood and he
[1:04:03] wanted more Christians aren't like that
[1:04:07] right that's not the life of Christ come
[1:04:10] on church I it going to get kind of
[1:04:11] tight here for a minute and then we're
[1:04:12] going to we're going to move on but
[1:04:14] Christians aren't like that brother Bron
[1:04:16] said people can jump up and down shout
[1:04:18] all night long speak in tongues like
[1:04:19] pouring Peas on a dry cide while cried
[1:04:22] out the next morning with enough temper
[1:04:23] to fight a buzz saw
[1:04:26] you know temper was still wrong just
[1:04:28] give you an update on that in 2024 it's
[1:04:32] still wrong to lose your temper if you
[1:04:34] did it wasn't the
[1:04:36] Lord don't blame it on
[1:04:39] God don't try to justify it you just you
[1:04:42] you lost your temper the whole idea of
[1:04:44] losing your temper means you were insane
[1:04:46] for a moment if you lost your temper it
[1:04:50] means that you were in the flesh and you
[1:04:52] need to
[1:04:53] repent right still a sin we said you can
[1:04:57] do all that and have enough temper to
[1:04:59] fight a buzz saw go right on out and
[1:05:00] tell something in the church will cause
[1:05:02] the whole church to be broke up there
[1:05:04] nothing in the world but enticing demon
[1:05:06] Spirits God help us today we don't want
[1:05:08] to blame our temper on God we don't want
[1:05:10] to blame our vindictiveness on God Lord
[1:05:13] take that out of me I just want to serve
[1:05:15] you Lord I don't want any of that in my
[1:05:18] life all
[1:05:20] right blame it on God the B said you
[1:05:23] watch a little old baby not over higher
[1:05:25] than that I don't know how high it was
[1:05:26] but little baby maybe higher than
[1:05:30] that right we've known some big
[1:05:33] babies all of us have we've all been big
[1:05:36] babies at some point in our
[1:05:39] life just gets so mad said he'd ring his
[1:05:42] hands turn red in the face and hold his
[1:05:45] breath ever seen a child do that a baby
[1:05:48] sure he will what is it it's his nature
[1:05:52] he got it from his py or his Mammy one
[1:05:56] times it's hard to figure that out you
[1:05:58] know she had enough temper to fight a
[1:06:00] buz saw or his daddy if they didn't his
[1:06:03] grandfather grandmother did to it's
[1:06:06] Offspring he said you're born in the
[1:06:08] world you come by nature and your whole
[1:06:11] being is black and smudy and Damned and
[1:06:14] cursed and going to hell that's pretty
[1:06:17] dark isn't it but we need to recognize
[1:06:19] that that's the way we came here but
[1:06:22] it's not the way we have we can stay
[1:06:25] aren't you glad for Grace today that's
[1:06:27] the way Paul came his whole being he was
[1:06:30] a ravening
[1:06:31] wolf breathing out threatening and
[1:06:34] Slaughter the Brandon said you're born
[1:06:36] in the world you come by nature but when
[1:06:37] you're born again then the light of God
[1:06:39] shines down into that soul and it's no
[1:06:41] more a dark Valley but it's a valley
[1:06:43] with a shadow in it so he says there's
[1:06:46] light now in it there's still a shadow
[1:06:48] because you're still here in the flesh
[1:06:49] but there's light there he said you may
[1:06:51] be veiled here with the Flesh and the
[1:06:53] things of our face but there's enough
[1:06:55] light in there and someday that light
[1:06:57] Darkness has to separate oh I'm so glad
[1:07:00] we're looking forward to that day I'm
[1:07:02] not what I was but I'm not what I'm
[1:07:04] going to be I'm going to I'm going to
[1:07:05] leave this old body of Flesh One Day by
[1:07:08] Grace I'm going to do it I'm going to
[1:07:10] walk out of this old body I'm going to
[1:07:11] walk out of this old this this thing
[1:07:13] that holds me down this thing that I
[1:07:15] have to keep under subjection I'm going
[1:07:17] to walk out of it one of these days and
[1:07:19] the light is going to separate from the
[1:07:22] darkness oh I think that ought to give
[1:07:24] us hope he said but whe been I've failed
[1:07:26] I've done this t or the other don't you
[1:07:27] realize that one of these days that
[1:07:29] Darkness will
[1:07:32] leave Hallelujah but there's got to be
[1:07:34] light in there when that moment comes to
[1:07:37] overcome that
[1:07:38] Darkness right he said you may be veiled
[1:07:41] here with the flesh the things over our
[1:07:42] face but there's enough light in there
[1:07:44] and someday that light and darkness has
[1:07:46] to separate when the light shines
[1:07:48] Darkness fleas oh I'm so grateful for
[1:07:51] that today you know I got a lot of
[1:07:52] darkness in my life shine some light on
[1:07:55] it sir let the light come in that's good
[1:07:58] one day that Darkness and Light will
[1:08:01] separate Acts chapter 9 verse two Paul
[1:08:05] desired of the high priest letters to
[1:08:07] Damascus to the synagogues that if he
[1:08:09] found any of this way whether they were
[1:08:12] men or women he might bring them bound
[1:08:13] unto Jerusalem he didn't have no pity he
[1:08:17] was a raving
[1:08:18] wolf as he journeyed he came near
[1:08:22] Damascus and suddenly there shine round
[1:08:25] about him a light from heaven and he
[1:08:28] fell to the Earth and he heard a voice
[1:08:30] saying unto him Saul Saul why
[1:08:34] persecutest thou me and he said who art
[1:08:37] thou Lord see he knew that was a pillar
[1:08:40] of
[1:08:40] fire and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[1:08:43] thou
[1:08:44] persecutest it is hard for thee to kick
[1:08:47] against the Pricks other words the ox
[1:08:49] goes because God had been channeling
[1:08:52] Paul into the new birth all the time
[1:08:55] Paul didn't know it but God had actually
[1:08:57] been tricking him he'd been moving him
[1:09:00] he'd been working on him and you may not
[1:09:02] realize today you say well I know
[1:09:04] somebody that was in church and now
[1:09:05] they're not or I know somebody that
[1:09:07] really needs God don't you realize that
[1:09:09] they're a seat of God God's already
[1:09:10] working he's already pricking he's
[1:09:12] already bringing he's already pushing
[1:09:14] you may not see it yet but it's already
[1:09:16] taking
[1:09:17] place it was hard to kick against the
[1:09:19] Pricks and he trembling and astonished
[1:09:22] said Lord what Willl thou have me to do
[1:09:24] the Lord said him arise go to the city
[1:09:27] and it shall be told thee what thou must
[1:09:30] do now I want I want you to tell me
[1:09:32] tonight what did Paul have to do with
[1:09:36] that did he get himself in a good
[1:09:40] atmosphere think about it now I believe
[1:09:44] we should get ourselves in a good
[1:09:45] atmosphere but we can only do that by
[1:09:46] the Holy
[1:09:47] Ghost what did Paul do good to to get
[1:09:51] himself converted now this is you know
[1:09:54] those of us I like the service to run
[1:09:56] just right everything to be just right
[1:09:58] but what did Paul
[1:10:00] do what was done for Paul to to get him
[1:10:04] to a place where he could be converted
[1:10:07] God put him right in the place where he
[1:10:08] needed him where he wanted him but but
[1:10:11] Paul didn't have anything to do with it
[1:10:15] nothing
[1:10:17] nothing I know you're sitting there
[1:10:19] thinking brother Ben you know for
[1:10:21] me you know I believed the message only
[1:10:25] if you had something to believe
[1:10:29] with right there had to be a deposit of
[1:10:34] faith I I I but you don't understand I I
[1:10:37] pulled myself up by by my bootstraps
[1:10:39] that might work in in the economy it
[1:10:41] don't work with
[1:10:43] god brother Brandon said that was a god
[1:10:46] dishonoring proverb God helps those that
[1:10:48] help themselves but the B said it was a
[1:10:50] god dishonoring
[1:10:51] proverb God don't help those who help
[1:10:54] themselves God helps those who can't
[1:10:56] help
[1:10:57] themselves right and he was there three
[1:11:00] days without sight in verse n neither
[1:11:02] did eat nor drink nothing he could do he
[1:11:05] just
[1:11:06] helpless the pillar of fire spoke to him
[1:11:08] he said he said when you go down there
[1:11:10] and just wait and then I'll tell you
[1:11:11] what to do he had to wait it's all he
[1:11:15] could do the Lord spoke to ananas to to
[1:11:19] go down there was a a Believer there in
[1:11:22] uh in Damascus to go down lay hands on
[1:11:25] him but Paul had been so murderous to
[1:11:27] the church that ananas was he he in
[1:11:30] first at first he said no no Lord no no
[1:11:33] not him you imagine if a guy come in
[1:11:36] that was so bad that we refused to lay
[1:11:38] hands on
[1:11:40] him ananas had to have a vision to go
[1:11:43] lay hands on Paul because he was so bad
[1:11:47] nobody wanted to touch him because they
[1:11:49] were afraid it was a trick they afraid
[1:11:51] that he was coming down they had heard
[1:11:52] he was coming down to destroy them him
[1:11:55] yes sir but he been
[1:11:57] changed oh my look they and ananas was
[1:12:02] so reluctant to go but the Lord said go
[1:12:03] thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto
[1:12:06] me to Bear not my name before the
[1:12:07] Gentiles and Kings and the children of
[1:12:09] Israel for I will show him how great
[1:12:11] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[1:12:13] I know people today say we don't need
[1:12:14] Ministry no more we don't need pastors
[1:12:16] we we don't need we don't need uh
[1:12:18] evangelists anymore but even Paul
[1:12:20] couldn't save himself he couldn't lay
[1:12:22] hands on himself he couldn't give
[1:12:24] himself the Holy Ghost it come from one
[1:12:26] member of the Bride to
[1:12:27] another God had to send ananas down into
[1:12:31] the place where Saul was so he could be
[1:12:34] filled with the Holy Ghost and anas went
[1:12:37] his way and entered into the house and
[1:12:38] putting his hands on him said brother
[1:12:39] Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared
[1:12:41] un thee in the way as thou camest has
[1:12:43] sent me that thou mightest receive thy
[1:12:45] sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:47] I love the way he addresses him there I
[1:12:49] just noticed that brother
[1:12:52] Saul because whether you're all the way
[1:12:54] in whether you're wherever you are on
[1:12:56] your journey it's still brother Saul
[1:12:59] because God working on him amen God
[1:13:01] showed ananas this is going to be a
[1:13:03] believer he's going to do great things
[1:13:04] he's going to suffer great
[1:13:06] things we called him brother
[1:13:13] Saul and immediately there fell from his
[1:13:15] eyes as had been
[1:13:17] scales he received sight and the rose he
[1:13:19] couldn't make himself
[1:13:22] see it took the Holy Ghost to do that
[1:13:26] he didn't go to church he didn't read
[1:13:29] the word he he didn't sing a song he
[1:13:33] didn't reform himself try to do better
[1:13:36] but the revelation of Christ Christ The
[1:13:40] Mystery of God revealed came to him by
[1:13:45] Grace the same way it came to You and I
[1:13:49] by
[1:13:50] grace and Paul's attitude towards
[1:13:52] Ministry was shaped by this Revel
[1:13:56] Philippians 1:12 I would you should
[1:13:58] understand Brethren that the things
[1:13:59] which happened unto me listen you're
[1:14:01] going to have things happened to you
[1:14:04] it's just part of it the things which
[1:14:07] happened to me have fallen out rather
[1:14:09] unto the furtherance of the
[1:14:12] Gospel oh my if we can all look at it
[1:14:15] like that the things which happened to
[1:14:17] me what happened to him he was
[1:14:18] Shipwrecked he was bitten by a snake he
[1:14:20] was he he was run from City to City he
[1:14:22] was stoned and left for dead he was beat
[1:14:25] he was put in prison he was sitting
[1:14:27] there with his hands in Chains even then
[1:14:29] and he said the things that happened to
[1:14:31] me was for the furtherance of the Gospel
[1:14:35] so that my Bonds in Christ are manifest
[1:14:38] in all the palace and in all other
[1:14:39] places and many of the brethren in the
[1:14:41] Lord waxing Confident by my bonds much
[1:14:44] more bold to speak the word without fear
[1:14:47] some indeed preach Christ even of envy
[1:14:50] and strife some also of goodwi the one
[1:14:54] preach Christ of intention not sincerely
[1:14:56] supposing to add Affliction to my bonds
[1:14:59] but the other of love knowing I'm set
[1:15:01] for the defense of the Gospel what then
[1:15:04] he said well I I I really like those
[1:15:06] ones that preach because of love for the
[1:15:08] right motives he knew there was some
[1:15:10] preaching for the wrong things but he
[1:15:13] said what then notwithstanding every way
[1:15:15] whether in pretense or in truth Christ
[1:15:17] has preached and let that I want that to
[1:15:20] be my attitude towards Ministry I want
[1:15:22] that to be my attitude towards churches
[1:15:24] I towards our our brothers and sisters
[1:15:26] I'm not just saying that some of y'all
[1:15:28] are here tonight but I didn't know you
[1:15:29] were going to be here but I'll say this
[1:15:31] that we should have that attitude
[1:15:33] towards one
[1:15:34] another that that whether in pretense or
[1:15:36] in truth Christ is preached hey if the
[1:15:38] message is being declared let me put my
[1:15:40] shoulder to the wheel try to be a part
[1:15:43] of it in every way I
[1:15:46] can what then and I with standing every
[1:15:49] way whether in preaching or in truth
[1:15:51] Christ is preaching I therein do Rejoice
[1:15:54] yeah and will rejoice
[1:15:56] I know that this shall turn to my
[1:15:58] salvation through your prayer and the
[1:16:00] supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:16:03] according to my Earnest expectation and
[1:16:05] my hope that in nothing I shall be
[1:16:07] ashamed but that with all boldness as
[1:16:09] always so now also Christ shall be
[1:16:12] magnified in my body whether it be by
[1:16:14] life or by death he said he he had such
[1:16:17] a revelation of Christ in Paul he said I
[1:16:19] may be in Chains but Christ is going to
[1:16:21] magnify himself in those chains that the
[1:16:24] the gospel is going to be further down
[1:16:26] the road than what it was because I was
[1:16:28] put in
[1:16:30] prison
[1:16:32] right you knew he had nothing to do with
[1:16:34] his calling it didn't matter what people
[1:16:36] did to him it'd be for the furtherance
[1:16:39] of the Gospel if you had nothing to do
[1:16:41] with your salvation then everything that
[1:16:42] happens to you must be ordained of the
[1:16:45] Lord right and all things must work
[1:16:48] together for good right right you had
[1:16:52] nothing to do with it anyway
[1:16:55] see Paul understood you got to let God
[1:16:56] be God that's what he told him don't
[1:16:59] don't kick against the Pricks if God
[1:17:00] God's doing something in your life let
[1:17:02] God be God let the chips fall where they
[1:17:06] may and I think that and I'm just
[1:17:09] expressing my heart because I I I
[1:17:12] sometimes I get introspective and I look
[1:17:13] down the road and I think sometimes as
[1:17:15] pastors we get to feeling like we're so
[1:17:17] essential to the life of the church
[1:17:19] because because I I believe a pastor the
[1:17:21] office of a pastor is essential to the
[1:17:24] life of the church but but the
[1:17:27] particular Pastor sometimes as a pastor
[1:17:29] we get to feeling like we are and we end
[1:17:31] up holding on longer than we should I'm
[1:17:34] not about to leave I'm just you know
[1:17:36] someday I'll be
[1:17:37] old and and and people my weight don't
[1:17:41] age
[1:17:43] well
[1:17:44] wow it's cold brother
[1:17:47] Joel but I got thinking about that and I
[1:17:49] thought what what would happen if I got
[1:17:50] to where I couldn't take care of the
[1:17:51] church anymore what am I going to do see
[1:17:54] we got to Empower others to follow
[1:17:57] us right because God's going to have a
[1:18:00] church I didn't make myself a preacher I
[1:18:03] I didn't put myself here behind this
[1:18:05] Pulpit God did that and if God did that
[1:18:09] oh church then if I'm gone somebody else
[1:18:12] will step in and I can have confidence I
[1:18:15] I can I can I can go take a vacation
[1:18:17] knowing that God will will perform what
[1:18:20] he promised he would perform even if I'm
[1:18:22] not here and yet I feel like I need to
[1:18:25] be here but it's not that I'm so
[1:18:27] essential to the life of the church
[1:18:28] because what happens is we hold on much
[1:18:30] longer than we should but I believe that
[1:18:33] what's essential is the mystery of who's
[1:18:35] doing this in the first place it's not
[1:18:37] me revealed to the church it's Christ
[1:18:39] revealed to the
[1:18:41] church sir and if the deacons change and
[1:18:44] the trustees change and the and the
[1:18:46] whole face of the church changes there
[1:18:48] will still be somebody declaring the
[1:18:49] gospel of Christ God's big enough to do
[1:18:52] that
[1:18:55] right if I can't serve him in my
[1:18:56] capacity anymore he'll find somebody
[1:18:59] else right it's because of
[1:19:03] Grace he loves his people
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:09] Hallelujah now look Paul empowered
[1:19:12] others I won't go get to all of this but
[1:19:14] in in second Timothy 4 he talks about
[1:19:16] that and he talks about how he's getting
[1:19:18] ready to to go and so what does he do
[1:19:20] instead of holding on to what he has he
[1:19:23] empowers Timothy to go fight to go do
[1:19:26] what he did and I'm I'm grateful for the
[1:19:27] men that give me the ability to do what
[1:19:29] I do today because it wasn't for men
[1:19:31] that allowed me to do what I do allowed
[1:19:33] me to make my stumbles and things I
[1:19:35] couldn't be where I'm at today and yet I
[1:19:37] know there will be other men come up
[1:19:38] I've got to let them I've got to I got
[1:19:40] to suffer with them
[1:19:42] too right and we do as a church because
[1:19:46] we know we're trying to get the Next
[1:19:48] Generation ready they got to have their
[1:19:51] Revival it's one thing for me to have
[1:19:53] mine and then sit there and and and
[1:19:54] preach against it the rest of my life or
[1:19:56] I can let them have their
[1:20:00] Revival what Paul say I fought a good
[1:20:02] fight I've finished my course I've kept
[1:20:05] the faith henceforth there is laid up
[1:20:07] for me a crown of righteousness which
[1:20:09] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[1:20:11] me at that day not to me only but unto
[1:20:13] all them also that love is appearing
[1:20:15] what was it he knew by grace that God
[1:20:17] didn't count his mistakes to him that
[1:20:19] God only saw he' fought a good
[1:20:22] fight wasn't that he never made a M
[1:20:24] stake said he knew he was called by
[1:20:27] Grace he was saved by grace he' go home
[1:20:30] by
[1:20:34] Grace Wonder we could say by the grace
[1:20:36] of God I am what I am you see if we
[1:20:38] really knew how little we had to do with
[1:20:41] our own salvation we'd be far less
[1:20:43] critical of
[1:20:49] others but the brand said that's where
[1:20:51] the church the people so-called the
[1:20:52] church have so miserably
[1:20:56] failed because it is in their own
[1:20:58] personal work that they feel that they
[1:21:00] Merit the goodness and grace of God by
[1:21:03] what they do and how they live but that
[1:21:06] has not one thing to do with it it's a
[1:21:10] gift of
[1:21:12] God but what did that do to Paul Paul
[1:21:14] said I served him in a greater way I
[1:21:16] served him with more diligence than
[1:21:18] anybody because I knew it was
[1:21:21] Grace right if you really get a
[1:21:23] revelation of Grace you serve him that
[1:21:25] much more and you all know that I as a
[1:21:28] pastor I I I want us to do I want us to
[1:21:31] work I want us and I try to set that
[1:21:33] example I want to I want to be the
[1:21:35] hardest worker in the church I want us
[1:21:36] to do the things that God wants us to do
[1:21:39] I want us to be diligent about it I want
[1:21:40] us to be timely about it but yet I know
[1:21:43] none of those things will save me and
[1:21:45] none of those things will save a single
[1:21:48] person only Christ can do that that's
[1:21:51] good but he have somebody who is
[1:21:53] diligent
[1:21:54] right he'll have somebody who who does
[1:21:56] do the work but they won't do it because
[1:21:58] because it's just something they're
[1:22:00] doing to earn their salvation because
[1:22:01] the Baptist can do that a Methodist can
[1:22:03] do that some a presbyterian can do that
[1:22:05] but who can who can really realize that
[1:22:08] who Christ is in this hour it takes a
[1:22:10] Believer this message to really
[1:22:13] recognize who they
[1:22:14] are and really recognize who's doing the
[1:22:18] work Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are you
[1:22:20] saved through faith and that not of
[1:22:23] yourselves it is the give gift of God
[1:22:26] not of Works L any man should
[1:22:28] boast now watch brother BR said and I'm
[1:22:30] going to close on this but it's a a
[1:22:32] little bit of a quote got a a few
[1:22:34] paragraphs to it and brother brand said
[1:22:37] this he said watch this master teacher
[1:22:39] Paul the first thing he does is knock
[1:22:41] out all the idea of falling
[1:22:45] away right because I'm not preaching to
[1:22:48] you out of fear that you're going to
[1:22:49] fall away I don't want you to be afraid
[1:22:52] of that at all
[1:22:54] that's what Paul did he he knocked out
[1:22:56] all the idea of Falling Away knocked out
[1:22:59] all the idea of ever being a Christian
[1:23:01] today and tomorrow I'm gone and the next
[1:23:03] day God condemned me and the next day
[1:23:05] I'm back again brother said that's
[1:23:09] nonsense now he's talking to Saints he
[1:23:11] said he don't preach that way in
[1:23:12] evangelism he still made altar calls
[1:23:15] right he still brought people to an
[1:23:17] altar and preached conviction to their
[1:23:19] hearts but he's talking to Saints I
[1:23:22] believe we're talking to Saints tonight
[1:23:24] amen now look he said he's trying to
[1:23:26] tell them the first thing get it out of
[1:23:27] your mind that you're going to get lost
[1:23:30] and you're going to do this and you're
[1:23:31] scared of this don't be scared of
[1:23:33] nothing on Hallelujah for he's trying to
[1:23:37] tell you where you're at who you are how
[1:23:40] you're standing oh church we can only
[1:23:42] recognize that he said she will one
[1:23:45] day Hallelujah he said now you might do
[1:23:48] things
[1:23:49] wrong oh no really I might do things
[1:23:52] wrong
[1:23:57] every one of us do you know the person
[1:23:59] who did it is wrong and the people who
[1:24:01] talked about it we're
[1:24:06] wrong just as
[1:24:10] wrong oh God help us
[1:24:12] today help me look he's trying to tell
[1:24:16] them the first thing get it out of your
[1:24:18] mind he might do things wrong every time
[1:24:19] you do anything wrong you're going to
[1:24:21] get paid for it sure you'll reap what
[1:24:23] you sow but that has not one thing to do
[1:24:25] with your
[1:24:27] salvation now listen we believe in
[1:24:29] predestination I told that story and I
[1:24:30] know that it shakes some people about
[1:24:32] brother Ramsey R talked about him how he
[1:24:34] refused and all these things and we
[1:24:36] don't know all the particulars of that I
[1:24:38] I confess I don't fully understand that
[1:24:40] but I'll say this if you are one of gods
[1:24:42] you cannot be
[1:24:48] lost and a great example of that is the
[1:24:51] Jews because they've done everything
[1:24:54] possible possible to be
[1:24:57] lost right and there will still be
[1:25:01] 144,000 right during the tribulation
[1:25:03] period they'll be saved and receive the
[1:25:06] believe the message that's what our
[1:25:09] Prophet taught us there'll be 144,000
[1:25:11] Jews who believe the message and see
[1:25:13] Christ and recognize him for what he is
[1:25:15] what is that
[1:25:17] Grace some people think well Grace is
[1:25:19] over when the bride's gone there'll
[1:25:20] still be Grace just to the
[1:25:23] Jews right because why not because of
[1:25:26] anything they did but because they're
[1:25:28] God's chosen
[1:25:29] people oh if you can only understand
[1:25:32] what you are and who you are
[1:25:34] today amen he said when you're born of
[1:25:37] the spirit of God you've got eternal
[1:25:39] life yes and can no more die than God
[1:25:42] can
[1:25:44] die I wish you young people just really
[1:25:46] get
[1:25:47] that oh look you say brother Ben if we
[1:25:50] preach that then people will people will
[1:25:52] fall away not if they got a revelation
[1:25:54] of it on only if they just have a head
[1:25:57] knowledge of it come on right but if you
[1:26:00] ever get a revelation of it you ever
[1:26:02] really get born again you'll realize
[1:26:04] listen there nothing you can do to not
[1:26:06] be a born again
[1:26:07] Christian Hallelujah brother brand said
[1:26:10] he was born a brandom I was born a pruit
[1:26:13] I might be the worst looking example of
[1:26:14] a pruit that there is but I'll never not
[1:26:16] be a pruit why pu blood runs through my
[1:26:19] veins brother BR said I'll never he said
[1:26:21] I could be crippled with arthritis he
[1:26:22] said but I'll never not be a br
[1:26:24] why because random blood run through his
[1:26:27] veins oh if we just recognize royal
[1:26:30] blood runs through your veins how could
[1:26:32] you ever be
[1:26:33] lost when the life of God is inside of
[1:26:36] you but you just there's Darkness still
[1:26:38] there you're in a valley of of a shadow
[1:26:40] of Darkness but remember remember
[1:26:42] there's coming a day when the darkness
[1:26:44] and the light will be separated you
[1:26:46] won't deal with that old flesh no more
[1:26:48] oh I'm looking forward to that I'm
[1:26:50] looking forward to that
[1:26:52] day Hallelujah
[1:26:55] hallelujah how are we part of God by one
[1:26:58] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:27:01] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:27:02] we be Bond or free but all made to drink
[1:27:05] into one Spirit brother brand said how
[1:27:08] could God judge him again and I made
[1:27:11] this point to several but I found our
[1:27:13] young people I found in counseling our
[1:27:15] young people as they come up I once they
[1:27:17] get married and they begin to you know
[1:27:19] you don't really start making mistakes
[1:27:20] till you get married because then
[1:27:21] someone's there to tell you you made a
[1:27:22] mistake
[1:27:26] all I'm
[1:27:30] sorry right he didn't know you were
[1:27:32] making mistakes just going along freely
[1:27:34] and then now you have somebody to tell
[1:27:35] you when you make a mistake God gives us
[1:27:38] that for a reason brother Brown said for
[1:27:40] some people that's their cross to bear I
[1:27:44] I'm grateful for a woman of Grace in my
[1:27:46] life that has Grace on
[1:27:49] me and doesn't judge me for all the
[1:27:51] things that all the mistakes I've made
[1:27:54] but listen to this yeah you're going to
[1:27:56] make mistakes and I've watched our young
[1:27:58] people they struggle with
[1:28:00] that how could God judge Christ
[1:28:07] again when he went to Calvary he's
[1:28:10] already went to
[1:28:12] Calvary and I've gotten this this idea
[1:28:14] that well this bad is happening in my
[1:28:16] life because of something I did it can't
[1:28:18] be right now God could be testing you he
[1:28:22] could be trying you he allow you to be
[1:28:24] tried he could he could actually be uh
[1:28:27] moving you in a direction he wants you
[1:28:29] to go in he could be silent in your life
[1:28:31] for a while to get to nudge you in the
[1:28:33] right
[1:28:34] direction but it is not
[1:28:37] punishment it cannot be
[1:28:43] punishment it can't be how could you we
[1:28:47] only get a revelation of this tonight
[1:28:49] how could God judge him again when he
[1:28:52] went to Calvary going up gol he was
[1:28:54] beaten bruised he could not heal he
[1:28:56] could not even speak a word hardly cuz
[1:28:59] why he had the sins of the world on him
[1:29:02] not because he was a sinner but he was
[1:29:04] made sin for me and for
[1:29:08] you all the sins of the world from Adam
[1:29:11] until his coming rest upon his shoulder
[1:29:14] and God was not punishing his
[1:29:16] son he was punishing sin right he said
[1:29:20] see how horrible it was oh Peter if you
[1:29:23] just get a revelation of that Esther my
[1:29:24] children all of these children they can
[1:29:26] ever get a revelation of that God was
[1:29:28] not punishing his son he's not punishing
[1:29:30] you he just calling to
[1:29:33] you he was punishing sin said see how
[1:29:37] horrible it was ought to make us hate
[1:29:39] sin in every form in our life he was
[1:29:42] making a propitiation he was making a
[1:29:45] way of Escape for all those that God by
[1:29:47] his forn knowledge knew would come he
[1:29:50] said now then when you're by one Spirit
[1:29:52] we're baptized into that body body what
[1:29:54] are you baptized into his body the body
[1:29:58] that sin was judged
[1:30:01] in Hallelujah you're baptized into the
[1:30:04] when we say we're the body of Christ
[1:30:06] what are we saying we're
[1:30:09] perfect sin was already judged in that
[1:30:13] body Hallelujah brother Brandon when
[1:30:15] we've went through it in Christ The
[1:30:16] Mystery of God revealed he said he took
[1:30:18] out of his side Eve it completely the
[1:30:21] bride came completely from his side so
[1:30:24] how she could could she be lost she come
[1:30:27] from him she's part of him and brother
[1:30:30] Brown makes a statement he said now then
[1:30:32] when you're by one Spirit baptized into
[1:30:34] that body one body which is Christ we
[1:30:36] are safe
[1:30:39] forever Hallelujah in one place he said
[1:30:41] we're just as safe as that body is
[1:30:45] safe Hallelujah that body couldn't see
[1:30:48] corruption it couldn't be lost God
[1:30:51] redeemed that body and we're just as
[1:30:53] safe as that body is safe just ass sure
[1:30:56] oh God just as sure as there's a literal
[1:30:58] Jesus Christ that'll come in a body form
[1:31:00] to receive his elect we're just that
[1:31:02] safe ourselves yes sir Hallelujah that's
[1:31:06] true we just need this Darkness to be
[1:31:08] separated from the
[1:31:10] light
[1:31:13] Hallelujah he said now there's where it
[1:31:15] seems to strangely strike especially the
[1:31:17] Armenian Believers what Armenian means
[1:31:20] it's we don't think about that today but
[1:31:22] as Armenians but back in the day it was
[1:31:23] a big deal Armenian is someone who
[1:31:25] follows the teachings of armenius who
[1:31:27] believed that there was no
[1:31:28] predestination or election at all so
[1:31:30] that would be your Methodist and and
[1:31:32] some Baptists and things like that and
[1:31:34] then on the other side you had Calvin
[1:31:35] brother BR said he was a calvinist as
[1:31:37] long as Calvin stayed with the
[1:31:38] Scripture it was Armenian as long as
[1:31:41] Armenia stayed with the scripture he
[1:31:43] said the Armenian believers they
[1:31:44] struggle with that he said have to do
[1:31:46] something that to Merit their s or some
[1:31:49] Meritor something how can it be by two
[1:31:53] things at the same time it's either by
[1:31:56] Grace or by works one it can't be by the
[1:31:58] same thing it's by two different things
[1:31:59] got to be by the one he said my I just
[1:32:01] can't see nothing else but the grace of
[1:32:03] God and brother BR said that's my makeup
[1:32:06] and I believe God called our Prophet for
[1:32:07] a reason he said that's my makeup he
[1:32:10] said I always did believe in grace he
[1:32:12] said I'm just Grace all over that's all
[1:32:15] why because he was like Paul he knew God
[1:32:16] called him brother brandom tried to kill
[1:32:19] them young boys you remember right now
[1:32:21] don't you try that you try that it might
[1:32:23] work
[1:32:24] but he tried it remember what happened
[1:32:26] the gun wouldn't go
[1:32:27] off all that was in him wanted to kill
[1:32:30] them and he would have never become a
[1:32:32] preacher never done never traveled
[1:32:35] around the world seven times what was it
[1:32:37] what was it was
[1:32:39] Grace tried to kill himself twice it's
[1:32:43] Grace oh God we just regognize Grace to
[1:32:46] us and I can't see nothing else he said
[1:32:49] but the grace of God you imagine looking
[1:32:50] back at that what brother Brandon must
[1:32:52] have felt like to be brought from that
[1:32:54] to the place where he was he said I
[1:32:56] can't see nothing but Grace he said it
[1:32:58] isn't even in my life when I was a boy I
[1:33:00] couldn't see nothing just Grace Grace he
[1:33:02] said they they say you scratch my back
[1:33:04] and I'll scratch yours well it's an
[1:33:06] awful expression he said but I don't
[1:33:08] care whether you scratch mine or not if
[1:33:11] yours needs scratching I'll scratch you
[1:33:14] anyhow I've told these young people
[1:33:16] listen to me everybody tells you how to
[1:33:18] be happy today and they said take do
[1:33:20] self-care and make yourself happy and
[1:33:22] make sure you take time for yourself and
[1:33:24] do this for yourself and do that for
[1:33:25] yourself it's the worst way in the world
[1:33:27] to be happy it's an easy way to be
[1:33:30] miserable you want to be happy do
[1:33:32] something good for somebody else you
[1:33:35] want to be happy in your marriage make
[1:33:36] your wife happy make your husband happy
[1:33:39] you want to be happy in the church make
[1:33:40] the people in the church
[1:33:42] happy right listen that's the way to be
[1:33:45] happy is by making somebody else happy
[1:33:47] he said I don't care whether you scratch
[1:33:48] mine or not if yours need scratching
[1:33:50] I'll scratch you anyhow
[1:33:53] see he said Grace Hallelujah yes sir see
[1:33:57] grace works by love he said if you need
[1:34:01] it if you need it I'll do it oh if our
[1:34:06] marriages worked that way how much
[1:34:07] better marriages would we have not
[1:34:09] because I'm made to do it not because
[1:34:11] somebody forced me not because somebody
[1:34:13] stood over me and told me this is what
[1:34:14] you have to do to be my wife or my
[1:34:16] husband but because of Grace because of
[1:34:19] Love see he said if you need it I'll do
[1:34:21] it whatever needs to be done that's what
[1:34:23] I'll do do and if both people would
[1:34:25] think like that you never have any
[1:34:28] problems if people in a church would
[1:34:30] think like that I'll do what needs to be
[1:34:32] done I don't need a title I don't I
[1:34:34] don't need an office I don't need
[1:34:35] anything else I just want to do what
[1:34:37] needs to be done if you could ever begin
[1:34:39] to think like that you begin to be happy
[1:34:41] and you don't even know why you're happy
[1:34:42] I'm doing all this work I'm stressed out
[1:34:44] all the time but I'm still happy why
[1:34:47] because I did what needed to be done and
[1:34:49] God Honors that it's the spirit of
[1:34:52] Christ said Grace yes sir Grace works by
[1:34:56] love if you need it regardless if you
[1:34:58] never done nothing for me I don't have
[1:34:59] one thing to do with you if you need it
[1:35:02] I'll do it
[1:35:04] anyhow Grace because you need it he said
[1:35:08] I needed saving there was nothing could
[1:35:11] save me there was nothing I could do
[1:35:14] about
[1:35:14] myself I could do no more save myself
[1:35:17] than nothing musicians go ahead and come
[1:35:19] he said but I needed saving because I
[1:35:22] believed in a god and God sent his son
[1:35:25] made in the likeness of sinful flesh to
[1:35:27] suffer in my place I was saved by grace
[1:35:31] alone was I saved not one thing could I
[1:35:34] do or you do to save
[1:35:40] yourself what did Paul do let me ask
[1:35:42] again what did he
[1:35:46] do it wasn't that God sit down up in the
[1:35:48] heavens waiting on somebody to work hard
[1:35:50] enough come
[1:35:52] on come on so he could change them so he
[1:35:54] could fill them with the Holy Ghost but
[1:35:57] before Paul was
[1:36:00] born when he was in his mother's womb
[1:36:03] the Bible says he covered me in his
[1:36:05] mother in my mother's womb he possessed
[1:36:08] my Reigns before I was ever born he
[1:36:11] covered me he protected me and he said
[1:36:13] you're going to be a preacher you're
[1:36:15] going to do this you're going to be
[1:36:16] saved you're going to preach them people
[1:36:17] in Hardy I need you
[1:36:19] there oh
[1:36:21] Church what did Paul do to that
[1:36:24] nothing was by
[1:36:27] Grace but when he received that
[1:36:28] Revelation he worked harder than anybody
[1:36:31] else why because he knew he couldn't
[1:36:33] have worked to have done it he said I'll
[1:36:35] pay my vows I'll do what I
[1:36:38] can I can't I can't Merit salvation what
[1:36:41] did the thief on the cross do as you've
[1:36:43] heard before the thief on the cross just
[1:36:46] said the the man in the
[1:36:49] middle he told me I could
[1:36:52] come that's all
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:57] he said you could
[1:36:59] come he said the spirit and the bride
[1:37:02] say come they don't say stay away you're
[1:37:04] too you're too dirty you're too bad come
[1:37:07] but you got to recognize you're a sinner
[1:37:10] you got to realize who you are and you
[1:37:12] got to come to God and say Lord whatever
[1:37:14] you have want me to do I'll do it that's
[1:37:16] what Paul did how you know a person's
[1:37:18] had a real experience said whatever you
[1:37:20] want me to do I'll do it God said
[1:37:22] there's nothing you can do go wait on
[1:37:24] me
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] hallelujah he said I could come and you
[1:37:31] can come if we have that revelation of
[1:37:33] Grace I wonder then how should we treat
[1:37:35] one
[1:37:36] another see it's not me it's Christ in
[1:37:38] me he does the works and if you're
[1:37:41] baptized with the same Spirit as he was
