[0:01] you would not be who you are today
[0:06] unless you've been through what you've
[0:07] been through
[0:10] and some people do suffer more than
[0:12] others i wish i had an answer for that
[0:14] but there's a character he's working in
[0:16] your life and he'll do what it takes
[0:19] to bring that character out if he has to
[0:22] embarrass you
[0:23] if he has to if he has to make
[0:25] everything fall apart
[0:27] and it won't be because you're doing
[0:29] anything wrong look at job job was the
[0:31] best man on the earth
[0:33] god's best man and god removed the head
[0:37] drowning about him
[0:38] and suffering began to come
[0:42] he wanted to perfect his character
[0:44] wasn't because he was a bad person he
[0:45] was the best
[0:47] amen god does this for the best
[0:51] oh my
[0:54] he said according to paul he has left
[0:57] his
[0:58] church a measure of suffering that they
[1:01] too by their faith in god
[1:02] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:05] place
[1:06] of perfection why did he want this james
[1:10] 1 2-4
[1:11] my brother encountered all joy when you
[1:12] fall into divers temptations
[1:14] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:16] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:18] have a perfect work
[1:19] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:21] wanting nothing
[1:22] why does he stand by look he said the
[1:25] reason is in romans 8 17 to 18 if
[1:27] children than heirs
[1:28] heirs of god and joining us with christ
[1:30] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:33] that we may be also glorified together
[1:35] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:36] present time
[1:37] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:39] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:46] you realize job had to go through that
[1:47] and trust god and all he had was a bible
[1:49] written in stars
[1:54] didn't have a church age book i'm so
[1:56] thankful that we do
[1:59] he didn't have a message i'm so thankful
[2:02] that we do but all he had was a bible
[2:05] written in stars no old testament no new
[2:08] testament
[2:09] all he had was a bible written in stars
[2:13] and somehow he saw in those stars and
[2:16] that ox and those things that were there
[2:18] somehow he saw the purpose of god and in
[2:20] god revealing to him and showing him a
[2:22] redeemer amen
[2:24] oh god and think about it god never did
[2:27] tell him why
[2:29] he never did there's no inclination in
[2:31] the book of job that he ever told him
[2:32] why he suffered
[2:33] but he said there's a redeemer he did
[2:36] not show him why he suffered but he
[2:38] showed him
[2:38] my i know my redeemer lives in the last
[2:42] days he'll stand on the earth
[2:44] hallelujah so what you've got to know
[2:48] today
[2:50] know that he knows know that your
[2:51] redeemer is there
[2:53] and it'll hold you you see
[2:57] brother branham said unless we suffer
[2:59] with him
[3:00] we cannot reign with him you've heard
[3:04] this all before
[3:05] but listen to it now in this context he
[3:08] says you have to suffer to reign
[3:10] the reason for this is that character
[3:13] simply is never made without suffering
[3:15] character is a victory not a gift
[3:19] a man without character can't reign
[3:22] because power apart from character is
[3:25] satanic
[3:28] it's a powerful statement and you say
[3:32] well the person has to have experience
[3:33] then experience is not the same thing as
[3:35] character
[3:36] because you learn from experience but
[3:38] you can learn good things or bad things
[3:41] it's true it's how you respond
[3:45] to the suffering right if job had said
[3:48] okay i give up
[3:51] it's all over i'm giving up it would
[3:54] have proved who he was but god allowed
[3:56] him to suffer like that because he knew
[3:58] that he wouldn't give up amen
[4:01] he may have felt like it but he knew i'm
[4:03] so glad
[4:06] he knew that the smyrna church age could
[4:08] take it
[4:12] look at the confidence he puts in here
[4:14] today oh i feel his presence here this
[4:16] afternoon don't you love him
[4:20] listen he said since he wants us to
[4:23] share
[4:23] even his throne on the same basis
[4:27] that he overcame and is set down in his
[4:29] father's throne
[4:30] that we have to overcome to sit with him
[4:33] and the little
[4:34] temporary suffering amen
[4:38] i believe it was paul that called it
[4:39] your light affliction
[4:42] which is about for a moment very bad
[4:45] the little temporary suffering we go
[4:47] through now
[4:48] is not worthy but the jt to be compared
[4:51] to the tremendous glory that will be
[4:53] revealed in us when he comes
[4:56] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[4:58] who are willing to enter into his
[5:00] kingdom through much tribulation
[5:04] see we're not too careful we baby things
[5:06] so much that we want everything to come
[5:07] easy
[5:08] everybody to be able to and i do i want
[5:10] so bad as a pastor to make the way easy
[5:12] for you
[5:12] but listen if you're gonna rain if
[5:14] you're ever gonna reign you're gonna
[5:15] have to overcome
[5:18] and i can't overcome for you
[5:22] i can help you but i can't overcome for
[5:24] you
[5:25] listen thinking not strange concerning
[5:28] amen
[5:29] the fiery trials that are to try you
[5:31] this is what peter said is it strange
[5:32] that god wants us to
[5:33] develop a christ-like character that
[5:35] comes through suffering no sir
[5:37] we all have trials we are all tried and
[5:38] chastened to sons not
[5:40] one but goes through that i've read this
[5:43] over and over again in my life but i got
[5:45] a revelation of this one day
[5:46] i was sitting right back here brother
[5:48] brayden savage come and preach for us i
[5:49] think it was on a wednesday night and
[5:50] he'd come and preach this and read
[5:52] this quote and it just hit me
[5:55] it just really hit me he says the church
[5:57] that is not
[5:58] suffering is not being tried hasn't got
[6:02] it
[6:05] that's not necessarily how we would
[6:07] identify the church to go to is it
[6:11] think about it the church that isn't
[6:14] suffering
[6:15] and it's not being tried you see look at
[6:17] the message people what they're going
[6:18] through right now
[6:19] but look if we weren't suffering
[6:23] we wouldn't have it
[6:27] it isn't of god i'm sitting back there
[6:30] and well he's preaching
[6:32] probably been a year ago now i'm sitting
[6:33] back there and it just hit me i thought
[6:35] thank you god you're telling me that i'm
[6:39] yours
[6:40] you're telling me that we're a church
[6:42] that should exist
[6:45] that should be here because if we
[6:46] weren't suffering we haven't got it see
[6:48] we think in our carnal mindset
[6:50] that if you're not suffering if
[6:52] everything's going good and everything
[6:53] works right and every and there's a big
[6:55] bunch of people and everything's right
[6:56] that's the church that's got it but he
[6:58] said the church that is not suffering
[6:59] it's not being tried hasn't got it
[7:01] but i'll tell you this some of them big
[7:03] churches suffer too you just don't
[7:04] realize it
[7:06] huh many of them suffer many of the
[7:08] pastors suffer you don't know what some
[7:10] of the pastors have been through who
[7:11] have great ministries today
[7:12] who put in their time and been through
[7:15] it
[7:16] preaching to small groups of people
[7:17] working with people over and over being
[7:19] rejected over and over you don't
[7:20] understand
[7:21] what some people have been through it if
[7:22] you want to gain a ministry that
[7:24] reflects christ
[7:25] there's got to be you've got to enter
[7:27] into that through suffering
[7:30] you want to be a church that's of god
[7:34] you've got to enter into that through
[7:36] suffering hebrews 12 6 and 8
[7:38] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[7:41] and scourgeth every son whom he
[7:42] receiveth
[7:43] but if you be without chastisement we're
[7:45] of all are partakers
[7:46] then are you bastards and not sons now
[7:49] look
[7:50] this special condition in smyrna must be
[7:52] applied to every age there is no age
[7:54] free from it there is no true believer
[7:56] free from it
[7:56] this is of god this is the will of god
[7:59] it is needful
[8:00] he said we need the lord to teach us the
[8:02] truth that we are to suffer and be
[8:03] christ-like in doing it
[8:05] say lord teach me the truth about the
[8:07] millennium lord teach me the truth about
[8:09] the
[8:09] oneness of god and we can say amen to
[8:11] all of that i want to know it but here
[8:12] he said we need god
[8:14] to teach us the truth that we can suffer
[8:16] and be christ-like
[8:17] in doing it love suffereth long and his
[8:20] kind
[8:21] blessed are you when men shall revile
[8:23] you and persecute you shall say oh
[8:24] manner of evil against you falsely for
[8:26] my sake
[8:26] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[8:28] is your reward in heaven
[8:29] for so persecuted today the prophets
[8:31] which were before you
[8:33] i love this the cloudy skies and storms
[8:35] of life are no signs of god's
[8:36] disapproval
[8:38] well if i was right maybe this wouldn't
[8:40] have happened to me maybe this wouldn't
[8:41] have happened in my home in my
[8:42] relationship
[8:43] in in my church if i was right maybe it
[8:46] wouldn't happen no
[8:47] the cloudy skies are no signs of his
[8:48] disapproval
[8:50] neither are bright skies and still water
[8:52] signs of his love and approval
[8:53] his approval of any of us is only in the
[8:55] beloved
[8:58] his love is elective which he had for us
[9:00] before the foundation of the world
[9:03] does he love us ask yourself that
[9:06] question today does he love me
[9:08] does he love me oh yes but how shall we
[9:12] know
[9:12] we shall know because he said so and
[9:15] manifested that he did love us
[9:18] hallelujah
[9:19] for he brought us to himself and gave us
[9:22] of his spirit
[9:23] placing us as sons
[9:26] and how shall i prove my love to him
[9:35] david in psalms he said what shall i
[9:39] offer to the lord
[9:40] who's given so much to me
[9:44] what can i ever give him back he's
[9:47] forgiven me excuse me for being a baby
[9:49] but it's the truth today
[9:50] he's forgiven me over and over and over
[9:53] again
[9:56] he led me in green pastures by still
[9:58] waters prepared a table before me in the
[10:00] presence of my enemies what can i return
[10:02] to him
[10:04] i can't do for him what he did for me
[10:08] he said but i'll pay my vows in the
[10:09] midst of the congregation
[10:12] he said i will take the cup and the cup
[10:15] is the cup that you're giving of
[10:16] suffering it's the compass
[10:18] in type it be communion as well i will
[10:20] take it i'll be identified with him but
[10:22] i will take the cup i will
[10:23] i will partake of his suffering or
[10:25] whatever whatever he has ordained for my
[10:26] life whatever he's called for me to be
[10:28] i'll do that maybe you're a mother that
[10:30] suffers and worries about your kids and
[10:32] wonders
[10:32] what's going to happen but that's your
[10:34] cup that's what he that's what he
[10:35] allowed you to be in life then he said i
[10:37] will take that cup and i'll pay my vows
[10:39] in the midst of the congregation
[10:40] i'll raise my hands i'll worship i'll do
[10:42] i'll i'll do that's nothing like what he
[10:45] did i can't repay what he did
[10:46] but i can pay my vows
[10:51] how shall i prove my love to him by
[10:53] believing what he said
[10:56] and by conducting myself with joy
[10:59] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[11:02] allow us to come to pass
[11:06] very bad oh god help me
[11:10] sometimes we misidentify what's wrong
[11:12] with us
[11:14] we think
[11:17] that the problem is what what's
[11:18] happening in our lives
[11:20] and we want that taken away but we
[11:22] misidentify it
[11:24] many times god wants to teach us how to
[11:26] suffer patiently
[11:28] he wants to teach us how to react in a
[11:30] bad situation
[11:32] he wants to teach us how to love the
[11:35] unlovable
[11:38] we think the problem we say lord take
[11:40] this away take this away take this away
[11:42] and we don't realize we're praying
[11:43] against the will of god
[11:45] we should say lord if it be possible
[11:49] take this away we should always pray
[11:52] that way by the way
[11:53] start your prayer that way if it's
[11:54] possible take this away
[11:56] nevertheless
[11:59] how did the three hebrew children stand
[12:01] there they said we believe our god's
[12:03] able to
[12:03] deliver us but if he chooses not to
[12:07] hallelujah we will still not bow we will
[12:10] not serve your
[12:11] your gods we will not bow to the world
[12:14] why because even if you choose not to
[12:16] rescue me
[12:17] from my situation you're still god
[12:20] and so not rescuing me would be the best
[12:23] thing you can do
[12:24] because god never does less than his
[12:25] best thing
[12:30] tell you what you're gonna stop giving
[12:32] me sunday nights to preach but
[12:38] oh god listen he said well you don't
[12:41] understand my child brother ben
[12:43] the bible tells us so what does the word
[12:45] say so you have to bring your mind back
[12:46] to the word
[12:47] counseling many times is listening and
[12:50] then reminding people of
[12:51] what the word says let's come back to
[12:54] the word
[12:55] i know what's going on in your life but
[12:56] let's come back to the word
[12:59] let's come back to the word what does
[13:00] the word say there are no temptation
[13:03] taking you
[13:04] but such as is common to man somebody
[13:07] else suffers like that
[13:09] and usually you can find somebody in
[13:10] worse shape
[13:13] but god is faithful hallelujah
[13:17] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[13:20] above
[13:20] that you are able so your feelings will
[13:24] lie to you they'll tell you you can't go
[13:26] through this
[13:26] you can't make it but god said i already
[13:28] promised
[13:30] i will not suffer you to be tempted
[13:32] above what you're able
[13:34] but we're with the temptation also make
[13:37] a way to escape that you may be able to
[13:38] bear
[13:39] years ago but jt when i was at
[13:40] bransville i studied that word and i
[13:42] found out
[13:43] that he's painting a word picture in the
[13:44] original greek he's talking about
[13:46] someone that's been
[13:47] shipwrecked in the middle of the ocean
[13:49] but yet they're close enough they can
[13:50] see land
[13:52] and if they'll swim they can make it
[13:56] it might be hard they might have they
[13:58] might get to take the last ounce of
[14:00] their strength but he said with the
[14:01] temptation he will be able to make a way
[14:03] of escape
[14:05] hallelujah
[14:08] it may be difficult you might have to
[14:10] struggle you might have to
[14:12] prop your eyelids open in church you
[14:13] might have to worry you know
[14:15] there might be times where you fail but
[14:17] you know there is a way of escape
[14:19] there is a way of escape he didn't say
[14:21] there might be or there sometimes would
[14:23] be he said there
[14:24] is a way of escape
[14:28] he will make a way to escape that you
[14:30] may be able to bury it
[14:37] jesus suffering he was made perfect look
[14:41] he was suffering in the garden and it
[14:43] drew him into close communion
[14:45] with the father think about that
[14:48] it drew him into close community what
[14:50] did it do for him
[14:53] and it struck me lately how we want
[14:55] other people to participate in our
[14:56] suffering don't we
[14:58] we're human beings on some level we want
[15:01] people to participate
[15:03] people cry out on social media they want
[15:04] people to participate
[15:06] they want you know but jesus was human
[15:08] too
[15:09] look what he did in the garden he was
[15:12] the god man
[15:14] but in the garden his disciples stopped
[15:18] and the bible says jesus went a little
[15:20] further a little further than they could
[15:22] go aren't you glad he did
[15:24] but he went a little further he goes and
[15:26] prays and he goes back
[15:29] he says watch and pray won't you watch
[15:31] and pray
[15:32] but it wasn't their burden it wasn't
[15:34] their passion
[15:36] it wasn't theirs they could not do it
[15:41] he said can't you even watch with me one
[15:43] hour
[15:45] the human side of him he wanted them to
[15:47] at least acknowledge his suffering
[15:50] and they just fell asleep
[15:53] it didn't bother them enough to keep
[15:55] them awake
[16:00] and many times as humans we we want that
[16:02] we want somebody to participate in our
[16:04] sufferings we want somebody that can
[16:06] reach out to us and participate
[16:07] and empathize with us but you know where
[16:09] you'll find that you'll only find that
[16:11] in those who've suffered themselves
[16:15] you'll never find that somebody who's
[16:16] always been handed everything
[16:21] but he had to bear it alone
[16:25] but what did he do he got down on his
[16:27] knees and he came in close communion
[16:30] with his father when it was him and his
[16:33] father alone
[16:35] amen that's what you and i have to do
[16:38] he was our example in these things that
[16:40] when we suffer when we're wrongfully
[16:42] accused
[16:42] when no one else will bear our burdens
[16:44] with us we sit
[16:45] we kneel down and we cry out to god and
[16:47] say lord
[16:50] you're my father if it's possible let
[16:53] this cup pass from me but nevertheless
[16:56] not my will but thine we find an angel
[17:00] came and strengthened him
[17:02] i believe angels will strengthen you
[17:04] during that time
[17:07] musicians go ahead and come i'm
[17:11] you know in the afternoon you always
[17:12] want to preach a happy sermon so people
[17:14] will
[17:15] stay awake
[17:18] but i believe there's happiness to be
[17:20] found here
[17:22] and finding god's will for our lives
[17:23] even in suffering
[17:26] in 1895 andrew murray the great great
[17:29] preacher of the past he was in england
[17:31] suffering from a terrible back
[17:34] painful back he'd had an injury years
[17:37] before
[17:38] one morning he's eating breakfast in his
[17:39] room his
[17:41] host just told him of a woman downstairs
[17:43] who was in great trouble and wanted to
[17:44] know
[17:44] if you had any advice for and andrew
[17:47] murray handed her a paper he'd been
[17:48] writing on and said give her this advice
[17:50] i'm writing down for myself
[17:51] maybe that she'll find it helpful he
[17:53] wrote this
[17:55] he says in time of trouble say first
[17:58] he brought me here it is by his will
[18:02] i am in this straight place or this hard
[18:05] place
[18:06] in that i will rest next he will keep me
[18:10] here in his love
[18:12] and give me grace in this trial to
[18:14] behave as his child
[18:17] then say he will make the trial a
[18:19] blessing
[18:20] teaching me lessons he intends me to
[18:23] learn
[18:24] amen teaching me lessons he intends me
[18:28] to learn and working in me the grace he
[18:30] means to bestow
[18:31] and last in his good time he can bring
[18:35] me out again
[18:36] because i am here by god's appointment
[18:39] in his keeping
[18:40] under his training for his time
[18:44] andrew murray didn't write that for her
[18:45] he wrote it for himself
[18:51] i've been told
[18:55] that brother donny's church we looked at
[18:57] that and some 90 people something like
[18:58] that i noticed a name
[19:00] with a jim babb there that had covert
[19:03] and different ones
[19:06] some of the brothers been around there
[19:07] for years and meant so much to his
[19:09] ministry
[19:11] we've been blessed church we've been
[19:13] blessed we haven't suffered more than we
[19:15] have and yet i know some of you have and
[19:16] we've been through a lot
[19:18] but when it comes to this covet thing
[19:20] you think of sister karen pruitt and
[19:22] what
[19:22] what did that family do to deserve and
[19:24] she's in that position right now
[19:27] i think a brother robert i know he's
[19:28] probably watching this afternoon
[19:30] sitting at home and sister gene you know
[19:32] what do you what do you do to go through
[19:34] those things god's doing something
[19:38] see it's god's appointment that you're
[19:39] here
[19:41] you're in his care under his training
[19:44] for his time i
[19:45] found out today that the entire church
[19:47] at claremore oklahoma
[19:49] brother bryce and them our entire church
[19:52] has got coveted
[19:55] people that are sick and even dying
[19:59] i had a assist a dear sister who helped
[20:02] me
[20:02] early in my ministry by encouraging me
[20:04] and and doing things and she was in a
[20:06] church i was preaching in
[20:07] in the mountain home area sister sheila
[20:09] stoner found out she passed away the
[20:11] other day
[20:12] she was always a bright spot in my day
[20:15] even to this day she kept
[20:16] she'd keep me updated and things that
[20:18] i'm gonna miss that
[20:21] by the way a lot of people have to go
[20:23] through what they go through
[20:26] but you see god lets you go through some
[20:28] things so you can feel for them
[20:32] maybe in a time when this church was
[20:34] filled up all the time i don't know if
[20:35] it was but
[20:36] perhaps at one time years ago it was
[20:38] always filled up but now
[20:39] you can you can identify with the church
[20:41] it struggles
[20:44] i know that's plain speaking but it's
[20:46] the truth
[20:48] you've been through it you can identify
[20:51] with that
[20:52] but see we're not just a body here we're
[20:54] a body all around the world
[20:56] when one member suffers we all suffer
[20:58] with it
[21:00] i wonder today if we could if they'll
[21:02] play something softly
[21:03] i wonder if we could just bow our heads
[21:06] and just talk to god for a moment
[21:08] i believe in your prayers today saints i
[21:11] believe in them
[21:13] i believe in them i i believe that it's
[21:15] important
[21:16] that you pray but also believe in what
[21:18] you pray and who you are
[21:20] i guess i just not to put myself in the
[21:24] place of christ but to be a
[21:25] little bit like jesus today would you
[21:27] pray for with me for one hour
[21:30] i believe we do have something that the
[21:31] disciples didn't have
[21:33] and i'm not asking you to pray for an
[21:35] hour but just just to turn our thoughts
[21:37] and
[21:38] our mind toward others who are suffering
[21:40] today
[21:41] i know there's there's things that need
[21:43] to happen
[21:44] i'm so god i'm so glad god's been
[21:46] gracious to us but
[21:48] if we could just look at others who are
[21:50] suffering maybe not think of yourself
[21:51] today
[21:52] but maybe there's somebody that you can
[21:54] think of or you've been praying for
[21:55] that's suffering that's going through it
[21:57] would you just talk to god about them
[21:59] now and
[22:00] and and and then we'll pay our vows
[22:03] we'll worship god
[22:04] what else can we do he's brought us
[22:06] through so much
[22:08] but let's just talk to him for a moment
[22:09] should we can we do that
[22:11] heavenly father lord jesus we love you
[22:14] today
[22:16] so grateful for your presence here on a
[22:18] sunday afternoon
[22:20] or that you took time to be with us
[22:23] lord to just come down among us sit
[22:25] through your word and just show us
[22:28] you had to suffer so you know what it's
[22:30] like when we suffered
[22:32] lord we've suffered we some here suffer
[22:35] with covet and different things
[22:36] in the past lord they can feel for other
[22:39] people
[22:40] i pray you'd help them today i pray
[22:43] you'd reach down lord that church in
[22:44] claremore oh god
[22:46] i pray you'd rid the sickness of that
[22:49] place
[22:50] lord i know there's people pray in other
[22:52] places i'm sure there's many other
[22:53] churches
[22:54] suffering lord struggling right now oh
[22:57] god that come in my heart today
[22:59] because i heard about it these are
[23:00] brother donny sometimes it just becomes
[23:02] nameless
[23:03] faithless people but lord some people
[23:05] that we've known and
[23:06] others that that maybe we've heard of
[23:09] lord that just need a special touch
[23:12] today
[23:13] i pray god that you'd reach down where
[23:14] they're at lord we know their church is
[23:17] praying others are praying
[23:19] won't you watch with me one hour we see
[23:21] the desire
[23:23] of your heart lord lord i pray that that
[23:25] would be
[23:26] us today maybe there's some in this
[23:28] church lord
[23:30] that suffer maybe they have suffered in
[23:31] life but they can enter in for somebody
[23:34] else
[23:35] who's going through a similar situation
[23:38] and i pray for that person today
[23:39] think of brother robert sitting there
[23:41] and his mother and
[23:43] different ones lord if they hear this
[23:45] today and
[23:46] i pray god that you'd help them to
[23:48] understand
[23:50] that they are in your time and your
[23:51] perfect will
[23:53] lord and we don't always understand why
[23:55] but we know you're
[23:56] we're in your hands oh god i pray for
[23:59] them today
[24:00] i pray with whatever empathy that i have
[24:02] whatever whatever i
[24:04] can i can't identify with everybody but
[24:06] you can lord
[24:08] you went through so much while you were
[24:11] here
[24:12] that you're able to suffer with each one
[24:14] and able to be a high priest to every
[24:17] every person i'm so thankful of that
[24:19] lord
[24:21] lord with whatever empathy we have
[24:22] whatever sympathy we could show
[24:25] oh god i pray he would help us to suffer
[24:28] one with another
[24:29] realizing that one day there will be
[24:31] glory revealed in us
[24:33] and the suffering of this present time
[24:35] is not worthy
[24:36] to be compared to the glory revealed in
[24:38] us on that day
[24:40] i pray you'd grant it lord lord one day
[24:42] i'm going to sit down with some of these
[24:44] people
[24:45] lord in that day i'm going to sit down
[24:46] with them and now we'll be in
[24:48] his throne with him judging
[24:52] lord those who have come before us those
[24:54] who have given a cup of cold water
[24:56] those who have come in our path oh god
[24:59] would you develop a character in us here
[25:01] so that we can judge righteously on that
[25:03] day we don't want to ever react on
[25:06] out of the things of the world or a
[25:08] desire for retribution but lord
[25:10] may we be like you in all things or we
[25:13] know we don't become that overnight
[25:15] but there's something about yielding
[25:17] ourselves we have to be taught
[25:18] to yield ourselves even in that body
[25:21] that was created
[25:22] the body for god you still had to suffer
[25:26] and learn obedience by the things you
[25:28] suffered teach us obedience today
[25:31] teach us through your word and through
[25:33] our lives what it means to obey the word
[25:36] i pray you would do it today i thank you
[25:38] for these people coming
[25:40] lord as we now turn our thoughts towards
[25:42] you and thank you
[25:43] for what you've done and thank you for
[25:45] your goodness and worship you just a
[25:47] moment
[25:48] oh lord i pray that there'd be a true
[25:51] worship would come from our hearts
[25:52] that you would recognize it as being
[25:54] from you lord is something that is worth
[25:57] not just an emotion or something that's
[25:59] worked out but god
[26:00] something that comes from the inside of
[26:01] the inside lord of returning
[26:03] a paying of our vows lord like the leper
[26:06] that was cleansed
[26:07] one came back and said thank you and was
[26:09] delivered of all his sins
