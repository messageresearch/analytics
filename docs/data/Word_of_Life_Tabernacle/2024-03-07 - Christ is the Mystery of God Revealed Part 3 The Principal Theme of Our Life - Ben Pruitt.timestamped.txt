[0:00] ated people was the only ones that heard
[0:03] it and now search back the scripture
[0:06] down through the age of the prophets and
[0:07] see if it wasn't the same
[0:10] name now and Jesus here referring them
[0:14] to the prophet and the Psalms he said
[0:17] they all spoke of him see and here these
[0:22] Jewish teachers rabis doctors of the law
[0:25] professors had did exactly like they had
[0:28] done before now notice again he said
[0:32] search the scriptures for they are they
[0:35] that testify of
[0:37] me search the scriptures the scriptures
[0:40] the entire
[0:42] scriptures what am I trying to do to
[0:44] show you that this Bible is the thing
[0:47] it's
[0:47] right the other day standing in a
[0:50] hospital room talking a sister had asked
[0:53] me to explain about denominations why we
[0:56] was against
[0:58] denominations uh with some
[1:00] denominational
[1:01] people you see it's got to come back to
[1:04] the word because the word is God see and
[1:09] Jesus declaring the same here that the
[1:12] word is
[1:14] him you can't make the scripture
[1:16] contradict itself in the beginning was
[1:19] the word and the word is with God and
[1:20] the Word was God and the word made
[1:23] flesh now here he says search the
[1:27] scriptures they testify me
[1:31] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:33] that's true and they are the one that
[1:35] bear record of
[1:37] me and I'm bearing record of them and if
[1:40] I do not the works that's promised that
[1:42] I would do then don't hear me but if I
[1:45] do the works and you can't believe me
[1:46] believe the works because they testify
[1:49] that he is the
[1:50] word oh it looks like it couldn't be any
[1:53] pler
[1:55] see all right now search the scriptures
[1:59] he said Moses and all the laws and so
[2:02] forth and the prophets and Psalms spoke
[2:04] of him and again he said the scriptures
[2:06] testify of him he is the principal theme
[2:10] of the entire
[2:12] Bible if you read the Bible and don't
[2:15] see Christ and every verse of it go back
[2:18] and read it
[2:20] again if you can't see Christ in every
[2:23] verse of the Bible then you read it
[2:24] again because you missed something the
[2:27] Bible is Christ he is the word when you
[2:31] read in the beginning God created
[2:33] there's Christ see every from that to
[2:36] the Amen in Revelations is every word
[2:39] testifying of Jesus Christ that's why
[2:42] these added books that called the second
[2:45] book of Daniel and uh the book of the
[2:47] macbes uh adds purgatory and stuff like
[2:50] that see it's not spoke of in the
[2:52] scripture see it doesn't theme up with
[2:55] the rest of it there's no place to place
[2:56] Purgatory in there there's no place to
[2:58] place intersection of saints and things
[3:00] there's no place in there for that
[3:02] there's no place for denomination
[3:04] there's no place for for Creeds outside
[3:06] of the of the
[3:08] Bible so when you see those things they
[3:10] just don't come into the picture and
[3:13] that's why people has added those and
[3:14] got their their their jigsaw puzzle all
[3:17] mixed up see they can't make it right
[3:20] same yesterday today and forever but if
[3:22] the things put together right there's
[3:23] the entire picture of the fall and
[3:27] regeneration the whole picture of
[3:29] creation and God's whole plan revealed
[3:32] right in Jesus
[3:34] Christ amen that's the whole picture set
[3:38] together every little crooked corner
[3:40] it's just like not I don't mean to be
[3:42] sacrilegious for this but it's just like
[3:44] putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's
[3:47] why we got pictures today that looks
[3:48] horrible say we are believers and a cow
[3:51] picking grass up in top of the tree
[3:53] don't worry that's when they say he's
[3:55] every way but just of a certain he's
[3:57] same yesterday and forever all but a
[3:58] certain thing see then ruin your picture
[4:01] the Bible said he is the same St John 5
[4:05] or St John 14:12 he said he he anybody
[4:09] he that believeth on me the works that I
[4:11] do shall he do also well that was for
[4:12] another age there you got your picture
[4:14] wrong again you got a man fishing out in
[4:17] the desert for fish and a bunch of hot
[4:19] sand where there's old fish at see see
[4:22] you got to bring him back to where he's
[4:23] fishing at Galilee where there's plenty
[4:25] of fish you see you you got to make the
[4:27] picture look right it's God's Great
[4:29] picture and there's only one way you'll
[4:30] see it that when you see Jesus Christ
[4:33] there's the entire Bible he's the
[4:35] principal theme of The Bible now you
[4:38] realize that any of these places here
[4:40] you could take a text it's just hard for
[4:42] a preacher to hold his peace you look
[4:43] like you want to keep going with it but
[4:45] you got to get back to what we're
[4:46] teaching
[4:47] on he is the principal theme of The
[4:51] Bible he watch in the
[4:53] prophets he was in the song he was in
[4:57] the history of the Bible the Bible Bible
[4:59] is a prophetic book it's a historical
[5:02] book it's a book of love it's a book of
[5:05] of ssongs it's a book of life and in
[5:09] there you find Christ he was in the
[5:11] prophets he was in the Psalms he was in
[5:15] the history and he also in the Bible is
[5:19] the things that is to
[5:21] come so he was before and after what
[5:25] that is that making then the same
[5:26] yesterday today and forever and you
[5:29] inject something in there that doesn't
[5:31] make him the same yesterday and forever
[5:33] brother Le where do you go to you got an
[5:35] awful picture there or he was the
[5:38] history see and he is the prophet he is
[5:42] the Psalms he is everything and if you
[5:45] can't make him everything and the same
[5:48] where what your picture look
[5:51] like do you see it all right he is the
[5:55] thing he was the prophets he was in them
[5:57] he was in the Psalms he was in the
[6:00] history and he is the things to come the
[6:04] same yesterday today and forever Hebrews
[6:05] 138 if you're writing it
[6:07] down he should be then he should be the
[6:11] principle if that's what he is and we
[6:14] believe it don't we amen then if he is
[6:17] that then he should be the Principal
[6:20] theme of our
[6:23] talking of our thinking of our singing
[6:27] amen of our walks
[6:30] he should be the Principal theme of our
[6:34] life if he's the principal theme of The
[6:36] Bible and the Bible is in us then he
[6:38] should be the Principal theme of
[6:40] everything that we do say or think amenl
[6:43] should be Christ amen that right all
[6:47] right since we think this since he's
[6:50] been made made the head of all things to
[6:53] us the colossian said so here he's the
[6:56] head of all things to
[6:58] us for he was made for us which we are
[7:03] considered all things he said what about
[7:06] the sinner he was made to be the judge
[7:08] of The
[7:09] Sinner if you don't accept it he was
[7:12] made the glory for the believer who does
[7:14] accept it so there thing all things was
[7:17] made by him and for him and it takes the
[7:21] night to express the glory of the
[7:24] day it takes the vessel of Dishonor to
[7:28] express the

[39:45] name
[39:47] amen amen hallelujah good to be here
[39:50] tonight my you all were singing so well
[39:52] that I just wanted to listen to you sing
[39:54] for a while Colossians chap chapter 1
[39:57] and verse 18 we'll read that to get a a
[40:00] start tonight Colossians 1:18 as we
[40:04] continue in our series on Christ is the
[40:06] mystery of God revealed and tonight
[40:08] we're going to talk about the theme of
[40:11] our entire lives and uh he ought to be
[40:14] that we're going to find out out about
[40:16] that tonight Colossians
[40:19] 1:18 says and he is the head of the body
[40:23] the
[40:24] church Who is the beginning the
[40:27] firstborn from the dead that in all
[40:30] things someone say all things you might
[40:34] have preeminence I pray that the Lord
[40:36] would have his Blessing to the word you
[40:37] may be
[40:45] seated there are certain messages that
[40:48] brother Bron preaches that he could not
[40:51] preach before the opening of the seals
[40:54] and this is one of those messages
[40:57] that he
[40:59] preaches after the opening of the seals
[41:01] which could not have been preached
[41:02] before because it explains a lot to us
[41:05] about what that was all about and and
[41:08] really his whole Ministry what it was
[41:10] all about and you might look at this and
[41:12] say well I I don't see where this has an
[41:14] impact on my life but I'll say this it
[41:17] may have the the utmost impact on our
[41:19] personal lives because it tells us who
[41:22] we are and if we don't know who we are
[41:25] we're then we're vulnerable to what the
[41:28] devil wants to do to us in this hour
[41:30] which is to try to make us less than
[41:32] what we are to not have confidence in
[41:34] our weapon to fight a battle to not be
[41:37] able to come against the enemy because
[41:39] the enemy's coming in all the time isn't
[41:41] he's coming in and trying to destroy our
[41:43] homes trying to destroy our churches
[41:45] trying to destroy us as individuals
[41:47] trying to bring us down in all kinds of
[41:50] different ways so we but we must know
[41:53] who we are and when I'm saying that is
[41:55] not to be arrogant it's not to be
[41:56] anything else but it's to be able to
[41:58] identify ourselves in the word and say
[42:02] that's me like the little boy that
[42:03] looked in the mirror mama that's me and
[42:07] and so this is this is what brother
[42:09] brandom was doing is he's trying to
[42:11] place a bride uh in a certain place
[42:13] that's why he took as long as he did on
[42:16] this sermon before he left town uh and
[42:18] and he was getting really towards the
[42:20] end of his life though he may not have
[42:21] known that himself but there was an
[42:23] urgency to get this out and I'm glad
[42:25] that it it was was there now but brandom
[42:27] said he told the people just be as
[42:29] patient as you can he said for I feel
[42:32] that in this year if God will help me
[42:34] Will Reveal and bring into your mind he
[42:36] said all these other things that I've
[42:39] talked on through the days of the
[42:41] Tabernacle he said why I've said what
[42:44] I've said and why I've done what I've
[42:47] done this is why right so you want to
[42:51] know about brother rand's Ministry the
[42:52] seals the church ages adoption Hebrews
[42:56] this is
[42:57] why right this is why he said what he
[43:00] said this is why he did what he did and
[43:03] I love the fact that it comes back to
[43:05] the to Jesus Christ that's what it comes
[43:07] back to is the preeminence of Christ in
[43:10] the body right it comes back to him
[43:13] dwelling in US Christ in you the hope of
[43:16] glory that's what the message is about
[43:20] the message is not to promote some
[43:21] Ministry the message is not to put one
[43:24] person above another the message is not
[43:26] to beat people down the message is not
[43:28] about what you wear although that's part
[43:31] of it but that's not what it's about
[43:33] that's not the theme of it the theme of
[43:34] it is not not even what you do but the
[43:37] theme of it is Christ manifesting
[43:39] himself in our flesh that's right so
[43:44] brother brand said this is why he said
[43:46] now God's secret mystery he had before
[43:48] the world
[43:49] began now he says he introduces a
[43:52] statement that we we use all the time
[43:55] and you'll find a lot of these in Christ
[43:57] is the mystery of God revealed we call
[43:59] message catchphrases and this is where a
[44:01] lot of them come from because it's such
[44:04] an important sermon to what we believe
[44:07] so he says uh he says back in the back
[44:10] part of God's mind he said there was
[44:13] something that he was trying and was
[44:15] going to achieve and he had a motive in
[44:18] doing it in order to let himself be
[44:22] expressed he said because first there
[44:25] wasn't even a moon a star an atom a
[44:27] molecule or anything he was God but he
[44:31] exactly wasn't God at that time because
[44:33] God is an object of worship and there
[44:35] wasn't nothing to worship him so in his
[44:38] great mind he wanted these attributes to
[44:41] be expressed and in him was love you
[44:44] believe he's still expressing that
[44:46] attribute today aren't you glad that he
[44:48] is if you don't feel love if you feel
[44:50] unlove he's the attribute of love he he
[44:53] wants to express that in your life right
[44:56] in him was to be a father in him was to
[44:59] be son in him was to be a savior I'm
[45:02] glad he's a savior in him was to be a
[45:05] Healer aren't you glad he's a Healer
[45:07] that's in him that's his attribute he
[45:09] said all these great attributes that we
[45:12] see already expressed he said they were
[45:14] in God he said so he said in my opinion
[45:18] the first thing that he made was Angels
[45:20] because he he explains he said then they
[45:22] worshiped him that made him God so
[45:25] angels are what made God God God means
[45:27] an object of worship he said and he
[45:29] started from there he said as in
[45:31] previous messages I've tried to explain
[45:33] it and break it down and I didn't go
[45:35] back and get quotes from previous
[45:36] messages but you can go back and look
[45:38] and like the adoption series and there's
[45:41] many different messages Israel in the
[45:42] church brother brandom deals with
[45:45] exactly how creation took place and
[45:47] dramatizes it and all of that and just
[45:50] gives us a lot of information that was
[45:52] in the back part of God's mind if we can
[45:54] say it that way way so uh there was uh
[45:58] he said in previous message I tried to
[46:00] break it down he said then when the
[46:01] Angels began to worship him he said that
[46:03] was before there was even a molecule in
[46:06] the earth so the Earth the Bible says
[46:08] was without form and void it was nothing
[46:12] right there was nothing it was all
[46:14] Darkness wasn't no sun no moon no stars
[46:18] no nothing he said then he was God so
[46:22] before there was anything he was God cuz
[46:25] he created Ang so he would be God now he
[46:27] said as he asked Joe where was you when
[46:29] I laid the foundations of the world see
[46:31] when the morning Stars sang together the
[46:33] sons of God shouted for Joy he said
[46:35] where were you he said that was way back
[46:37] before the Earth he said now God had a
[46:40] purpose and a hidden Mystery he said and
[46:43] that's what I want to speak on the
[46:44] church this morning the hidden Mystery
[46:46] of God so this is a big subject because
[46:50] this is all of it right this is the this
[46:53] is an overarching View and that's that's
[46:55] what Christ is the mystery is it's an
[46:57] overarching view of the entire Bible the
[47:00] entire Plan of Redemption even going
[47:02] back previous to the Bible in the back
[47:04] part of God's mind he's going to show us
[47:06] all of it oh I'm so glad for the message
[47:09] of the
[47:10] hour and and it got to be more than just
[47:13] a book or a tape or something like that
[47:15] it's got to be a
[47:16] revelation it's got to be something real
[47:18] to
[47:19] us so he said where were you and and God
[47:22] had a purpose he said I want to speak on
[47:24] this purpose now he said he had in his
[47:26] mind before the world began how that has
[47:28] unfolded itself right down to this
[47:31] present hour that we're living He said
[47:34] then you will understand clearly then
[47:37] you see on I believe what is being done
[47:39] he keeps going back to this so listen
[47:42] you cannot understand the phases of
[47:45] brother Brandon's Ministry without
[47:47] understanding Christ is the mystery of
[47:49] God revealed said well why is that
[47:51] important for me to understand because
[47:53] if you're not careful you're looking for
[47:54] something else to happen and it's
[47:56] already taken place BR tells us that
[47:59] over and over he said man is always
[48:01] looking to what God has done looking to
[48:02] what he will do and not being able to
[48:04] see what he's doing right now right so
[48:07] this is about what he's doing right now
[48:09] right so if you understand the the
[48:12] phases of brother R's Ministry you
[48:14] understand that he calls that three
[48:16] polls of his ministry three polls uh and
[48:20] and in that he had those three things
[48:22] three different distinct ways that God
[48:24] worked you'll understand what was being
[48:26] done if you understand Christ is the
[48:28] mystery of God revealed so now he takes
[48:31] this and he connects it with the with
[48:34] the seventh
[48:36] seal now we we uh we dealt with the
[48:39] seventh seal here a while back if you
[48:40] remember I think I spent a few services
[48:43] on it and and on the seventh seal but I
[48:45] I was going to preach one more sermon
[48:47] and I didn't and now I get down to this
[48:50] and I realize that this is actually that
[48:53] and you'll hear people say that that
[48:56] uh there's a uh that the Christ is the
[48:58] mystery is actually the second part of
[49:01] the seventh seal and you'll actually
[49:03] hear preachers say that and I believe
[49:05] that too and this is why this is why we
[49:07] say that he said God's great mystery of
[49:10] how it's a secret he said he kept it a
[49:12] secret nobody know nothing about it even
[49:15] the angels didn't understand it see he
[49:17] didn't reveal it he said that's the
[49:19] reason under our seventh mystery when
[49:22] the seventh seal was opened there was
[49:24] silence he said the opening now watch
[49:27] the opening of the book was the
[49:29] revelation of his entire purpose of
[49:31] redemption right that's why I said
[49:33] Christ is the mystery could not have
[49:35] been preached before the opening of the
[49:38] book and and but now watch this so that
[49:41] seventh seal had to be open but there
[49:43] was silence now now there's one thing we
[49:46] don't know a part that we don't know and
[49:49] that's the day an hour of his return now
[49:50] brother bam alludes to that he said
[49:52] Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted
[49:53] to know when he would come he said even
[49:55] the son himself don't know when it's
[49:57] going to happen see God has this all to
[49:59] himself it's a secret he said and that's
[50:02] for the reason there was silence in
[50:04] heaven for a space of a half hour and
[50:07] seven Thunders utter their voices and
[50:09] John was even forbidden to write it the
[50:12] coming of the Lord he said that's one
[50:14] thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will
[50:16] come when he will come he said it's a
[50:18] good thing that he doesn't right that's
[50:22] familiar right if you go back to where
[50:24] we were in the seventh seal I don't know
[50:26] how well you remember but if you go back
[50:28] to where we were we read those words in
[50:31] the seventh seal I want to read them
[50:32] again brother brandom if you studied the
[50:35] seals you know that brother brandom cuts
[50:37] off the end of the tape in the seventh
[50:39] seal and he begins again on Monday
[50:43] morning right and people who believe
[50:45] every word brother brandom said was thus
[50:46] that the Lord have to they have a
[50:47] problem with this because brother
[50:50] brandom actually edited his own tape yes
[50:54] right and it's not because it was wrong
[50:55] wrong it's because it could be taken
[50:58] wrong right it's because of us not
[51:01] because of him but but we know that he
[51:04] was a human being but the message is
[51:06] true those two things can be true by the
[51:08] way that the message can be perfect and
[51:11] absolute and at the same time we realize
[51:13] brother Brandon was a man who made
[51:15] mistakes and was fallible does that make
[51:17] sense right all the all the prophets in
[51:20] the bible were made mistakes too and yet
[51:23] the Bible is is absolute but the message
[51:25] is not a Bible the message is the truth
[51:27] of the Bible so we don't have to go back
[51:30] and try to make every word fit together
[51:32] we just let it be what it is and catch
[51:34] the revelation of it that make sense
[51:36] tonight so this is important this is
[51:39] foundational to believing the message of
[51:41] the hour right and you say well brother
[51:44] Ben it's not important for me to to
[51:46] believe the message I I just want to
[51:47] hear about Jesus I want to hear about
[51:49] Calvary and he's going to tell you about
[51:51] Jesus about Calvary about all of those
[51:54] things in here
[51:55] but I want you to understand how
[51:57] important this is to you young people
[51:59] this is important this is foundational
[52:02] because if the devil can get you mixed
[52:04] up on whether you believe the message is
[52:06] important or not he'll take you right
[52:08] out of the house of
[52:10] God right if he can get you mixed up on
[52:12] whether or not whe whether what a
[52:14] prophet says
[52:16] matters he'll take you right out of the
[52:18] house of God right he you'll be let off
[52:21] in every kind of a uh it's something God
[52:24] give it to us for a reason this is too
[52:26] difficult of an age for us to rely on a
[52:30] reformer for us to rely on the word of a
[52:33] of a of a dimly lit something or another
[52:35] that we can't we can't really see what
[52:37] it is but it had to be brought in
[52:39] Clarity it had to be brought by a
[52:40] prophet in our day because the devil's
[52:43] going to take you unless you have
[52:45] something in you to be a bride that
[52:46] won't fall and I'm so glad there's a
[52:48] people on the Earth today that will not
[52:51] fall yes but there's got to be something
[52:54] there why won't the bride fall because
[52:56] we have God has in he has reinforced us
[53:01] behind the message of the
[53:02] hour he knew we would believe it oh
[53:06] isn't that
[53:07] wonderful
[53:09] now so so brother brandham goes to a
[53:12] motel room on Monday morning and he says
[53:15] this he begins like this he said we be a
[53:18] good thing he doesn't know anything
[53:19] about it now what did he just say in
[53:23] Christ is the mystery he said that's one
[53:25] thing he hasn't revealed yet how he come
[53:28] when he will come it's a good thing that
[53:29] he
[53:29] doesn't that's the first thing he says
[53:32] when he comes back in his second part of
[53:34] the seventh seal he said will be a good
[53:35] thing he doesn't know anything about it
[53:37] because if he did then he would
[53:38] impersonate that he said that's his
[53:40] tricks in doing things so therefore God
[53:43] has made it so hid to the whole world
[53:45] even to Heaven that there's no way of
[53:47] understanding it now watch he said only
[53:50] as God will reveal it
[53:54] himself right so let's go back that was
[53:56] from the seventh seal we'll go back to
[53:58] Christ is the
[53:59] mystery and he says this he has showed
[54:03] or it's almost like the same
[54:05] sermon he has showed or revealed it in
[54:09] every type that's in the
[54:11] Bible why couldn't Wesley see it Luther
[54:14] see it it took a prophet right in the
[54:17] Bible if you go back to 1 Samuel it says
[54:18] there was a time when there was no open
[54:20] Vision have you read that in the
[54:21] scripture there's no open vision and
[54:23] what that meant was that there was no
[54:25] clear word there was no Clarity to the
[54:28] word because there was no Prophet yeah
[54:30] right to tell them what was right and
[54:31] what was wrong we don't live in that
[54:33] kind of a time we live in a day with an
[54:35] open Vision you say well the prophet's
[54:36] not on the earth anymore but that's why
[54:38] we have the message brother the tape
[54:41] recorder was actually invented for the
[54:43] purpose the message of the hour was put
[54:45] on it so that we would know so you
[54:47] wouldn't be subject to just some whim of
[54:49] a Preacher right cuz I can tell you
[54:52] anything but you got to take it back to
[54:54] the word
[54:56] right aren't you glad you can have
[54:57] confidence in a preacher not because of
[54:59] who he is but because it goes back to
[55:01] the
[55:02] word but but don't reject something
[55:04] because you think it doesn't come from
[55:05] the word go search it out and find out
[55:07] first whether it does or whether it
[55:09] doesn't now the we we know that the so
[55:13] this is his he's talking about this
[55:15] seventh steal he said he showed it
[55:16] revealed in every types in the Bible
[55:18] therefore the entire Bible is the
[55:21] revelation of God's mystery in
[55:24] Christ Hallelujah see it it was
[55:27] everywhere yeah the the the mystery was
[55:29] all through the Bible but it could not
[55:32] be understood until this day why re
[55:34] Daniel 12:4 he said but thou Daniel shut
[55:37] up the words seal the book even to the
[55:39] time of the end guess where we're at
[55:41] tonight guess where we live we live at
[55:43] the time of the
[55:44] end and it's been
[55:47] revealed and and he said many will run
[55:49] to and fro knowledge will be increased
[55:51] and television programs and teachers
[55:53] will abound everywhere but there will be
[55:55] a truth
[55:57] somewhere Revelation 10:7 but in the
[55:59] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[56:01] what's he saying he's talking about the
[56:03] seven Thunders and under their voices he
[56:04] said they he said don't write it John
[56:06] but in the days of the
[56:08] voice amen when he when he shall begin
[56:10] to sound the mystery of God should be
[56:13] finished as he it declared to his
[56:14] servants the prophets oh my that ought
[56:17] to give us confidence today it ought to
[56:19] give us a uh an understanding if if
[56:21] God's word says this is who I am he
[56:23] can't change that
[56:25] there's nothing there's no more mystery
[56:26] to be revealed it's over so what that
[56:29] means is if I find myself looking at in
[56:32] the mirror of God's word and I see there
[56:34] a reflection of what God has made me
[56:36] then I know I cannot be lost amen
[56:39] because the word is unchangeable yeah
[56:42] good
[56:44] hallelujah amen now are you with me so
[56:48] far good and we'll just I'll take my
[56:52] time I won't hold you real late tonight
[56:53] but we'll have because I got to get up
[56:55] in the morning and drive too we're going
[56:57] to go over there but I'll come back on
[56:58] Saturday and I'm going to come back
[57:00] we'll have church on Sunday but we'll
[57:02] leave the young ones over there I can
[57:03] only handle so much Youth Camp just to
[57:05] be honest with
[57:10] you after about that fifth service man
[57:13] it just
[57:15] gets but it's good we we all we've
[57:17] always enjoyed
[57:19] it so I'm glad for the unity we've got
[57:22] among the young people going I I
[57:24] appreciate that so much you parents that
[57:26] are going so many of our older ones that
[57:28] are old enough to go are going we'll
[57:30] have more maybe next year if the Lord
[57:31] carries and allows us to do that thank
[57:34] you for doing that and I believe Lord I
[57:36] believe it'll be a special blessing for
[57:37] our youth for doing that and going
[57:39] together now brother brandom says he
[57:43] said the entire Bible is an expression
[57:46] of one goal that God had one purpose he
[57:50] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[57:54] now think about it it where are you at
[57:56] church you say the message isn't
[57:58] important it is the culmination of that
[58:01] goal yes where we're moving from this
[58:05] world remember the three-fold purpose
[58:07] we'll get into it later on in crisis the
[58:08] mystery the threefold purpose the first
[58:10] one was God in Christ the second one is
[58:13] Christ in you yes right and the third
[58:15] one is back like the Garden of Eden
[58:17] again so in this three-fold purpose he's
[58:20] he's closing out the second
[58:22] fold and going into the Third
[58:25] that's what the message is that's what
[58:28] the seventh seal is it's the coming of
[58:30] the lord it's the closing out the
[58:32] blending of Time and Eternity the
[58:35] closing out of the of of everything that
[58:38] has been and the opening up of
[58:40] everything that will be oh true if you
[58:42] just realize what he's done for us in
[58:43] our hour with the BR said if I could
[58:45] pick a time to live it would be this
[58:47] hour that's right because what the
[58:49] Revelation that God has given us in this
[58:51] day now look en fire Bible is an
[58:55] expression of one goal one purpose he
[58:57] wanted to achieve all the acts of the
[58:59] Believers in the Bible has been en tight
[59:02] and expressing what God's Great goal is
[59:05] now in this last day he has revealed it
[59:07] and shows it he said in God's help we'll
[59:09] see it right here this morning what the
[59:11] Lord has had in his mind all along and
[59:13] has expressed it he said therefore you
[59:15] can see the great meaning of what it's
[59:17] been to know this and then try to bring
[59:18] it to the people see he said then you
[59:20] don't he said he said I haven't went
[59:22] into details to try to explain it as God
[59:25] has revealed it to me but then now he
[59:27] goes into detail now begins to talk and
[59:30] types this to the disciples on Theus
[59:33] Road he talks about how Christ met them
[59:35] on the road and they didn't know who he
[59:37] was right and they began to tell him
[59:40] their story and how Jesus had died we
[59:42] supposed that he was the one you know
[59:44] that acted like some of us sometimes do
[59:46] and we lack revelation we supposed that
[59:49] this message would make us things
[59:51] different but now we're just walking sad
[59:53] along the road and seems like everything
[59:54] gone wrong but they didn't realize that
[59:58] it had gone exactly like it was supposed
[1:00:00] to go right Hallelujah so he meets them
[1:00:04] on the road and they told him their
[1:00:05] story and then Jesus responds this way
[1:00:08] in Luke 24:25 he said un them oh fools
[1:00:11] and soul of heart to believe all that
[1:00:13] the prophets have spoken ought not
[1:00:15] Christ to suffer these things and enter
[1:00:17] into his glory and beginning at Moses
[1:00:20] and all the prophets all the prophets he
[1:00:23] expounded oh I'd like to heard that
[1:00:24] sermon yeah he oh God you realize what
[1:00:29] brother Brandon was doing in messages
[1:00:30] like Christ is the mystery of God
[1:00:32] revealed the opening of the word it's as
[1:00:34] if we're we're on the emus Road and
[1:00:37] God's speaking through a prophet and
[1:00:38] he's telling us the things the same
[1:00:40] thing that Jesus told them Apostles on
[1:00:43] the
[1:00:44] Road God would wouldn't you like to have
[1:00:47] been there and heard that sermon as they
[1:00:49] were walking that six-hour sermon as
[1:00:51] they were walking down the
[1:00:52] road oh my sir I believe I believe we
[1:00:56] found out the same thing by the message
[1:00:57] of the hour look what was he doing
[1:00:59] identifying himself to these Apostles
[1:01:01] that all of the prophets and all of the
[1:01:04] Psalms and everything was him
[1:01:07] expressed brother Brown said he was
[1:01:08] teaching this not preaching it so people
[1:01:10] would understand he said now he was
[1:01:12] saying that all the Psalms and all the
[1:01:14] prophets spoke of him he said well there
[1:01:17] therefore that shows that all of the Old
[1:01:18] Testament someone say all all the Old
[1:01:22] Testament all the new test
[1:01:25] all the Psalms
[1:01:27] yeah if you got your Bible with you now
[1:01:30] just think about it you look at your
[1:01:31] Bible and you pick up the Old Testament
[1:01:33] the New Testament all the Psalms
[1:01:36] everything in there the
[1:01:37] singing the songs that were sung were
[1:01:39] sung of
[1:01:40] him I believe our song should still be
[1:01:43] about him he said take the 22nd Psalm
[1:01:46] and sing it and compare it with the
[1:01:48] morning of the crucifixion he said see
[1:01:50] my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me
[1:01:52] all my bones they stare at me they
[1:01:53] pierce my my feet my hands yet all those
[1:01:56] things there them singing that Psalm
[1:01:58] down there in the temple and crucifying
[1:02:00] the Very one said those great religious
[1:02:02] leaders those great men those great
[1:02:03] teachers yet so blinded that was reading
[1:02:05] the prophets was singing the songs and
[1:02:07] doing the crime that they said they
[1:02:09] would
[1:02:10] do they were singing the song that
[1:02:13] implicated
[1:02:15] them in the
[1:02:17] crime that they were
[1:02:20] doing oh God that's why singing the song
[1:02:23] is not enough right going to church is
[1:02:25] not enough but you got to there has to
[1:02:27] be Revelation God's got to reveal it to
[1:02:29] you look they were reading the prophets
[1:02:33] sing the songs but they could not see
[1:02:35] what could they not see the opening of
[1:02:37] the word yes right now why do I say that
[1:02:41] because Jesus was the opening of the Old
[1:02:44] Testament right the light on the Old
[1:02:46] Testament you you hear it's talk about
[1:02:49] the opening of the word you know what
[1:02:50] the opening of the word is it's the
[1:02:53] bride right because the bride is the
[1:02:55] light on the New Testament you take that
[1:02:57] home and chew on it for a while but it's
[1:02:59] actually the bride the oh
[1:03:02] God what we do brother BR said if they
[1:03:05] ever put forth another Branch or write
[1:03:07] another book of Acts behind it we're
[1:03:09] living there church we're living there
[1:03:12] what are we we are the opening of the
[1:03:14] word he was the open book The the Old
[1:03:17] Testament opened up but they couldn't
[1:03:19] see it in its open form they couldn't
[1:03:22] see it in it because it was Veil behind
[1:03:24] flesh and the same thing happens today
[1:03:27] go listen to the unveiling of God they
[1:03:29] couldn't see it in a prophet and they
[1:03:31] cannot see it in the bride right good
[1:03:34] right so they couldn't see the opening
[1:03:36] of the word so brother BR said so you
[1:03:39] can see here basically in the beginning
[1:03:40] the very thought that God had in his
[1:03:42] mind he hid it from all those Scholars
[1:03:44] he said and just a number of selected
[1:03:46] predestinated number a predestinated
[1:03:49] people was the only ones that heard it
[1:03:51] and now search back the scripture down
[1:03:52] to the age of the prophets and see if it
[1:03:54] was wasn't the same thing I want to
[1:03:55] elevate your thinking tonight you said
[1:03:57] well I struggle at home I'm struggling
[1:03:59] with my kids I'm struggling my marriage
[1:04:00] I'm struggling this way or that way I
[1:04:02] want to elevate your thinking tonight I
[1:04:04] want you to understand you're part of a
[1:04:05] bigger program I want you to understand
[1:04:07] you're part of something that's more
[1:04:09] than just your everyday job it's more
[1:04:11] than just what you're going through
[1:04:12] every day there's something real about
[1:04:14] this message and you can grab a hold of
[1:04:16] that you as a housewife you as a as a
[1:04:18] worker whoever you
[1:04:20] are you're a part of the economy of God
[1:04:23] you matter to
[1:04:26] God and you say well how will this help
[1:04:29] me will it help you when you lay your
[1:04:31] baby down and you realize that I may not
[1:04:33] understand all of it in my mind but
[1:04:35] somehow there's something inside of me
[1:04:36] that believes it and I know that when
[1:04:38] God when God all that he poured out of
[1:04:40] Christ he poured into the church and I
[1:04:43] know when my baby is sick I can pray I
[1:04:45] can lay hands on them and they can be
[1:04:47] well I know when my family when my kids
[1:04:50] are out of the Ark of Safety I can speak
[1:04:52] the word and they can come back
[1:04:57] that doesn't matter it does
[1:05:01] matter oh that we
[1:05:05] could Christ is the word if we could
[1:05:08] only Elevate him in our thoughts tonight
[1:05:11] we can lift him up that's what worship
[1:05:14] is is to lift him up amen yes lift him
[1:05:17] up out of History lift him up above
[1:05:18] denominations lift him up above
[1:05:20] personality lift him up that's our goal
[1:05:22] here at the church it's not to lift up a
[1:05:24] man not to lift up a preacher not to
[1:05:26] lift up the pastor but to lift him
[1:05:29] up not in on a cross because they lifted
[1:05:32] him up on a cross and he and he was
[1:05:34] crucified but let's lift him up in the
[1:05:37] way he was meant to be lifted up let's
[1:05:39] let's see him high and lifted up on his
[1:05:41] throne in his
[1:05:43] church
[1:05:47] Hallelujah I got to quit doing that I'll
[1:05:50] never finish I
[1:05:52] look he was all of
[1:05:55] it
[1:05:57] amen he said he said Jesus here
[1:06:00] paragraph 116 Jesus here referring them
[1:06:03] to the prophets in the Psalms he said
[1:06:05] they all spoke of him and here these
[1:06:07] Jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the
[1:06:09] law professors had did exactly like they
[1:06:11] had done before now notice again he said
[1:06:13] search the scriptures for they are they
[1:06:15] that testify of me search the scriptures
[1:06:18] the scriptures the entire scriptures he
[1:06:21] said what am I trying to do to show you
[1:06:23] that this Bible is the thing that's
[1:06:25] right and I know in the message
[1:06:27] sometimes we put the Bible say well we
[1:06:28] don't need the Bible anymore no the
[1:06:30] message of the hour was trying to show
[1:06:32] us that the Bible was
[1:06:34] right Wayne Lawson sent me a song the
[1:06:37] other day it's one I'd heard before but
[1:06:38] I like it he sent me a song it said it's
[1:06:40] old black song it said I know the Bible
[1:06:42] is right I means somebody's
[1:06:46] wrong you believe it today I know the
[1:06:48] Bible is right I might be wrong but the
[1:06:50] Bible's
[1:06:52] right he bad now he said search the
[1:06:57] scriptures they're the ones that testify
[1:06:58] me he said the other day standing in a
[1:07:00] hospital room talking and sister asked
[1:07:02] me to explain about
[1:07:03] denominations we was against
[1:07:05] denominations with some denominational
[1:07:07] people now now that's a good question
[1:07:10] why are we not a denomination brother
[1:07:11] brand preach do an entire sermon on that
[1:07:14] but see denomination takes Creed over
[1:07:16] the
[1:07:17] word so Christ cannot be preeminent in
[1:07:21] any church that takes anything thing
[1:07:25] over the
[1:07:26] word Let Me Go a step further Christ
[1:07:28] cannot be preeminent in your life if you
[1:07:30] put anything over the
[1:07:32] word a job money
[1:07:37] finances brother Bram said
[1:07:40] that talking about somebody that would
[1:07:42] would take a I'm not quoting verbatim
[1:07:45] but that there's a there's a quote
[1:07:46] brother brother BR talks about how that
[1:07:48] a person that would uh would put not put
[1:07:50] God first I just put it that way he said
[1:07:53] it' be like the Jing Ling of judas's
[1:07:55] coins in your
[1:07:56] pocket that's pretty strong isn't it he
[1:07:59] must be preeminent in our lives you
[1:08:02] believe it
[1:08:03] tonight now look you you denomination
[1:08:07] takes Creed over the word so we can't be
[1:08:09] a denomination we don't have Creeds and
[1:08:12] even like I said talk about these
[1:08:13] catchphrases that we got to be careful
[1:08:15] that that doesn't just become a message
[1:08:16] Creed or a message Dogma we believe the
[1:08:19] word right he said he said you see it's
[1:08:22] got to come back to the word because the
[1:08:24] word is God and Jesus declaring the same
[1:08:26] here that the word is him he said you
[1:08:28] can't make the scripture contradict
[1:08:30] itself in the beginning was the word and
[1:08:32] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:08:33] God and the word made flesh he said now
[1:08:36] here he says search the scriptures they
[1:08:38] testify of me in them you think you have
[1:08:41] eternal life and that's true and they
[1:08:42] are the one that bear record of me and
[1:08:44] I'm bearing record of them and if I do
[1:08:46] not the works that's promised that I
[1:08:47] would do then don't hear me but if I do
[1:08:49] the works you can't believe me but leave
[1:08:51] the works because they testify he is the
[1:08:52] word he said oh it looks like it
[1:08:54] couldn't be any pler he said all right
[1:08:56] now search the scriptures he said Moses
[1:08:58] and all the laws and so forth the
[1:09:00] prophets and Psalms spoke of him and
[1:09:02] again he said the scriptures testify of
[1:09:04] him he said he is now listen he is the
[1:09:07] principal theme sir of the entire
[1:09:11] Bible if you read the Bible here's
[1:09:14] another quote you've heard before if you
[1:09:17] read the Bible and don't see Christ in
[1:09:20] every verse of it go back back and read
[1:09:24] it
[1:09:27] again just open up my Bible and read
[1:09:31] look it's talking about 1 Chronicles 26
[1:09:35] 26 shouth and his breth were over all
[1:09:37] the Treasures of the dedicated things
[1:09:39] which David the king and the chief
[1:09:41] fathers the captains over thousands and
[1:09:43] hundreds and the captain of the host had
[1:09:44] dedicated he said brother Ben what does
[1:09:45] that have to do with
[1:09:48] Jesus look he's the theme yes right he
[1:09:53] he is the temple of
[1:09:55] God just think about it for a minute he
[1:09:58] is the temple of God you say well that's
[1:10:00] just you go back and go back in uh uh in
[1:10:04] numbers or or book like that and it just
[1:10:06] name after name after name after name
[1:10:09] you say what what good is that well it's
[1:10:11] teaching us something it's telling us
[1:10:13] something in every verse it points to
[1:10:16] him it it may it may you may have to
[1:10:18] walk up some steps to get there but it
[1:10:20] points to him right you might put this
[1:10:22] verse with that and with that one with
[1:10:24] that one but eventually it points to him
[1:10:26] when you finally get behind the curtain
[1:10:28] it's him are you with me now all of the
[1:10:32] things that were in the Old Testament
[1:10:33] all the things in the New Testament
[1:10:35] speak of Christ now he said if you can't
[1:10:37] see Christ in every verse of the Bible
[1:10:38] then you read it again because you miss
[1:10:40] something the Bible is Christ he is the
[1:10:45] word right he said when you read in the
[1:10:48] beginning God created there is
[1:10:51] Christ now people say he wasn't God or
[1:10:54] wasn't there at that time have a problem
[1:10:56] with
[1:10:57] that he said from from that to the Amen
[1:11:00] in Revelation is every word testifying
[1:11:03] of Jesus Christ and David put it this
[1:11:06] way in the Psalms he said then said I lo
[1:11:08] I come in the volume of the book it is
[1:11:12] written of
[1:11:13] me in the volume of the book now David
[1:11:16] is talking about the the petuk which is
[1:11:19] the first five books of Moses that's all
[1:11:21] they had written at the time he said in
[1:11:23] all five books of Moses it's written of
[1:11:27] me amen no no other part even uh even uh
[1:11:31] Adam Clark understands this when he says
[1:11:33] it this way he said he said that's what
[1:11:36] had been committed to writing this whole
[1:11:37] book speaks about Christ and his
[1:11:39] accomplishing the will of God not only
[1:11:41] in the seed of the woman shall bruise
[1:11:42] the head of the serpent and in thy seed
[1:11:44] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:11:45] blessed but in all the sacrifices and
[1:11:48] sacrificial rights mentioned in the law
[1:11:50] he is all of it amen now if you go back
[1:11:53] and there something strange you'll find
[1:11:55] what brother brandham taught about that
[1:11:58] in the old commentaries but not the new
[1:12:00] ones they try to say Well it if you put
[1:12:02] it in their context it doesn't speak of
[1:12:04] Christ but brother brand said it did
[1:12:07] Paul said it did right the the the
[1:12:10] reformers even understood that it did so
[1:12:13] it types Christ now
[1:12:14] look the brand said that's why I got a
[1:12:17] question on this one time and he said
[1:12:19] that's why we don't use these other
[1:12:20] books like the uh the Apocrypha he said
[1:12:23] that's why these added books that they
[1:12:24] call the second book of Daniel book of
[1:12:26] mccabes adds purgatory and stuff like
[1:12:27] that he said see it's not spoke of in
[1:12:29] the Scripture it doesn't theme up
[1:12:31] there's that word again it doesn't theme
[1:12:33] up with the rest of it now what's a
[1:12:36] theme you been to a theme
[1:12:39] park a real theme park is one with one
[1:12:42] theme so everywhere you go at Silver
[1:12:44] Dollar City say because that's really
[1:12:46] the only one I go
[1:12:47] to if you're wondering or Dollywood I
[1:12:51] guess everything in silver dollar St is
[1:12:54] 1880s right they go to Great extreme
[1:12:57] great extremes to theme up the entire
[1:13:00] theme park it it means to set or to
[1:13:04] place so they're placing you
[1:13:07] in
[1:13:09] 1880 the Bible places you in
[1:13:14] Christ amen he is the
[1:13:18] thing right so they're trying to place
[1:13:20] you in an era or or or a say Disneyland
[1:13:24] Mickey Mouse or in a with a certain
[1:13:26] feeling where you can lose yourself
[1:13:29] right and you can just you can just walk
[1:13:32] around and and you feel like a kid again
[1:13:34] right you feel like or you feel like
[1:13:36] you're in the 1880s and you hear the
[1:13:37] music and all the theme until you if you
[1:13:40] could go behind those buildings they
[1:13:42] just false fronts
[1:13:44] but but it's the theme tells you right
[1:13:48] that that you belong in that era and the
[1:13:51] Bible tells you that you belong in
[1:13:54] Christ are you with me now yes he's the
[1:13:57] theme he's the theme that's how Webster
[1:13:59] defined it in Webster 1828 dictionary to
[1:14:02] set or to place in music it's a series
[1:14:04] of notes selected as the text or subject
[1:14:07] of a new composition so each note is is
[1:14:10] is different each note by itself you'd
[1:14:13] never see a theme but when you put it
[1:14:15] all together there's a theme to the
[1:14:18] music oh church that's why we don't
[1:14:20] isolate scriptures we don't isolate
[1:14:22] quotes but we put it all together and
[1:14:24] when you put it all together it's Christ
[1:14:27] Heen when you put everything that we do
[1:14:29] everything we're striving for it's
[1:14:31] Christ are you with me now so when you
[1:14:34] take every note together you put Joseph
[1:14:36] and and Jacob and and and Elijah and all
[1:14:40] of them together it's
[1:14:42] Christ Oh look The theme is not William
[1:14:45] Brandon the theme is not Ben PR it the
[1:14:49] theme is
[1:14:50] Christ oh I love that sir amen I love
[1:14:53] that and William Brandon brother Brandon
[1:14:55] pointed you to Christ that's right and I
[1:14:58] hope today I can point you to Christ
[1:15:00] through a prophet's message you
[1:15:02] understand but I hope also I hope also
[1:15:05] that we can point each one of us to
[1:15:07] Christ by Our Lives now look brother
[1:15:10] said there's no place to place Purgatory
[1:15:12] in there now watch place it's not in the
[1:15:15] theme right you put P Purgatory in it's
[1:15:18] like seeing a brand new uh car driving
[1:15:21] down the street in silver dollar City
[1:15:23] you don't expect to see it there right
[1:15:26] it it's out of
[1:15:28] place there's no place to put Burgatory
[1:15:32] in the theme of Christ there's no place
[1:15:34] to place intercession of saints there's
[1:15:37] no place in there for that there no
[1:15:38] place for a denomination there's no
[1:15:40] place for Creeds outside of the Bible he
[1:15:42] said so when you see those things they
[1:15:45] just don't come into the picture now why
[1:15:47] look at every false Doctrine that's come
[1:15:48] to this message since we've been alive
[1:15:51] some of y'all seen a bunch of them yeah
[1:15:53] but I saw a bunch of them too because
[1:15:55] how we raised and everything I I was
[1:15:56] exposed to a lot of different doctrines
[1:15:59] look at all of them what's the problem
[1:16:00] but the Jared they every one of them
[1:16:02] when you put them together they point to
[1:16:04] this preacher or that preacher or this
[1:16:06] church or that church or this Doctrine
[1:16:09] or that Doctrine or that man or a
[1:16:11] prophet or a priest or somebody else but
[1:16:13] they do not point to Christ yeah right
[1:16:16] when you put the Bible together you get
[1:16:18] the picture right it points to Christ he
[1:16:21] said if the thing is put together right
[1:16:23] now now let me go back he said when you
[1:16:25] see these things they just don't come in
[1:16:26] the picture that's why people have added
[1:16:28] those and got their jigsaw puzzle all
[1:16:29] mixed up he said they can't make it
[1:16:31] right same yesterday today and forever
[1:16:33] he said but if the thing is put together
[1:16:35] right there is the entire picture of the
[1:16:37] Fallen regeneration the whole picture of
[1:16:40] creation and God's whole plan revealed
[1:16:42] right in Jesus Christ he said that's the
[1:16:45] whole picture set together he said every
[1:16:47] little Crook and corner he said I don't
[1:16:49] mean to be sacrilegious by this but it's
[1:16:51] just like putting a jigsaw puzzle
[1:16:52] together that's why we got pictures
[1:16:54] today that looks horrible say we're
[1:16:56] Believers and the cow's picking grass up
[1:16:57] in top of the tree he said it don't work
[1:17:00] right if you had a puzzle where the cow
[1:17:02] you got the cow made right because
[1:17:04] that's what you do first is it in the
[1:17:05] puzzle you make the the cow nobody else
[1:17:08] does that I I do the borders first and
[1:17:10] then the then the then the objects and
[1:17:13] then you fill in the grass and stuff and
[1:17:15] you get done and the cows in top of the
[1:17:17] tree eating grass you got a
[1:17:20] problem right that's what he's saying he
[1:17:23] said but now he said you he said when
[1:17:25] they say he's every way but just of a
[1:17:28] certain he's the same yesterday today
[1:17:30] and forever all but a certain thing see
[1:17:33] then you ruin your picture yeah that's
[1:17:35] right the Bible said he is the same St
[1:17:38] John 1412 he said he anybody he I love
[1:17:41] that there's a message Doctrine or not a
[1:17:43] message Doctrine an anti- message
[1:17:46] doctrine that says that the he in John
[1:17:47] 14:12 is brother
[1:17:49] brandham but this is what the brother
[1:17:52] brandham said about the he he said he
[1:17:56] anybody right he that believeth on me
[1:17:58] the works that I do shall he do also
[1:18:01] well that was for another age he said
[1:18:02] there you got your picture wrong again
[1:18:03] you got a man fishing out in the desert
[1:18:05] for fish in a bunch of hot sand where
[1:18:07] there's no fish at you got to bring him
[1:18:09] back to where he's fishing at Galilee
[1:18:11] where there's plenty of
[1:18:12] fish now brother Brown uses the term and
[1:18:15] steuart had some fun with it on Sunday
[1:18:17] cuz we were back there looking for the
[1:18:18] quote and brother M says it several
[1:18:20] times but not not in the Pulpit but the
[1:18:22] steart and we we were back there and and
[1:18:24] he was having fun with this brother
[1:18:25] brand said you need to get your brain
[1:18:27] baptized do you know he said that that's
[1:18:30] pretty harsh right there but he said you
[1:18:32] need to get your brains baptized says it
[1:18:34] several places and what he's talking
[1:18:36] about is you just if it doesn't make
[1:18:38] sense there's a reason it doesn't make
[1:18:41] sense now that don't mean you have to be
[1:18:43] able to put together every little thing
[1:18:45] all the dates and all of that but it the
[1:18:47] overall picture ought to make
[1:18:49] sense it shouldn't be so complicated
[1:18:51] that your kids have no hope hope of ever
[1:18:53] grabbing hold of it it shouldn't be no
[1:18:56] so complicated that your young people
[1:18:57] have no hope of ever grabbing hold of it
[1:18:59] it has to make sense as a whole so he
[1:19:02] said you got to you got to make the
[1:19:03] picture look right it's God's great
[1:19:05] picture and there's only one way you'll
[1:19:07] ever see that he said when you see Jesus
[1:19:09] Christ there is the entire Bible he is
[1:19:12] the principal theme of The Bible Amen
[1:19:15] brother Bram takes that and brother
[1:19:16] Herald he looks at that and he says you
[1:19:18] could take a sermon he said on every one
[1:19:19] of these thoughts well we're going to
[1:19:21] try to do that
[1:19:25] he said he's the principal theme of The
[1:19:26] Bible he was in the prophets he was in
[1:19:28] the Psalms he was in the history of the
[1:19:30] Bible he said the Bible is a prophetic
[1:19:32] book it's a historical book it's a book
[1:19:33] of love it's a book of songs it's a book
[1:19:35] of life and in there you find Christ he
[1:19:38] was in the prophets he was in the Psalms
[1:19:40] he was in the history he said also in
[1:19:41] the Bible is he is the things that is to
[1:19:43] come so he was before until after what
[1:19:46] does that make him then the same
[1:19:47] yesterday today and forever he was in
[1:19:50] the prophets and Moses said the Lord thy
[1:19:52] God will raise up unto thee a prophet
[1:19:54] like unto me and Isaiah it says of the
[1:19:56] increase of his government and peace
[1:19:58] there shall be no end he Reign upon the
[1:20:00] throne of David to order and establish
[1:20:01] with judgment and Justice and Micah he
[1:20:04] said he'll be born in Bethlehem out of
[1:20:06] thee shall he come forth unto thee that
[1:20:08] is to be ruler in Israel whose goings
[1:20:10] forth have been from old from
[1:20:12] Everlasting in Psalms it says the stone
[1:20:14] which the builders refused has become
[1:20:16] the head of the corner what was it he
[1:20:18] was in the prophets he's in the Psalms
[1:20:21] Proverbs even speaks of him did you know
[1:20:22] that
[1:20:23] Proverbs speak of him he said I was set
[1:20:25] up from Everlasting from the beginning
[1:20:27] wherever the Earth
[1:20:28] was Song of Solomon 56 s even in the
[1:20:32] Song of Solomon it speaks of him he said
[1:20:34] he's allog together lovely oh I'm glad
[1:20:37] that I love that he's allog together
[1:20:39] lovely the history he's in the history
[1:20:42] in 1 Samuel Samuel is a historical book
[1:20:44] it says I Will Raise Me Up a faithful
[1:20:46] priest that shall do according to that
[1:20:48] which is in my heart and in my mind and
[1:20:50] I'll build him a sure house and he shall
[1:20:52] walk walk before man anointed forever
[1:20:54] what is it's
[1:20:56] Christ just to give you a
[1:20:58] sample brother BR said he was also the
[1:21:00] things to come so he's the history he's
[1:21:03] the prophets he's the Psalms and he's
[1:21:06] the things to come Zacharias said his
[1:21:08] feet this is why we believe in a literal
[1:21:11] Corporal return of Jesus Christ right
[1:21:14] that's what the scripture said his feet
[1:21:16] shall stand in that day upon the Mount
[1:21:17] of oliv which is before Jerusalem on the
[1:21:20] East and the Mount of oliv shall cleave
[1:21:21] in the midst thereof from toward the
[1:21:23] East and toward the west there shall be
[1:21:24] a very great valley and half the
[1:21:26] mountains shall moved toward the North
[1:21:27] and half of it toward the South what is
[1:21:29] it it's Christ in his future work and
[1:21:32] things to
[1:21:33] come now if you don't have any faith you
[1:21:35] can't believe that but I believe it's
[1:21:39] coming he said brother Brown said you
[1:21:41] inject something in there that doesn't
[1:21:42] make him the same yesterday today and
[1:21:43] forever he said where do you go to you
[1:21:44] got an awful picture there he was the
[1:21:46] history he is the prophet he's the
[1:21:48] Psalms he's everything you can't make
[1:21:50] him everything in the same he said what
[1:21:52] your picture look like like he said he
[1:21:54] is the thing now if you go back and
[1:21:57] listen to that when he says thing he may
[1:21:59] be saying thing I think he's saying
[1:22:02] theme they've TR they put that in here
[1:22:04] as thing but I think he's saying he's
[1:22:05] the theme but he says it like thing said
[1:22:09] he was the prophets he was in them he
[1:22:12] was in the Psalms he was in the history
[1:22:15] and he is the things to come the same
[1:22:17] yesterday today and forever Hebrews
[1:22:20] 13:8 is the thing now look he he should
[1:22:23] be he should be the Principal he said if
[1:22:25] that's what he is he said we believe it
[1:22:27] don't we then if he is that I'm closing
[1:22:29] in just a moment if he is that then he
[1:22:32] should be the Principal theme of our
[1:22:36] talking now we're going to apply it of
[1:22:39] our
[1:22:40] walking amen of our
[1:22:43] thinking of our
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:46] singing it's not about me it's about him
[1:22:50] the preaching is not about me it's about
[1:22:52] him the singing is not about me it's
[1:22:54] about him that's why it doesn't matter
[1:22:55] you say well I get my feelings hurt cuz
[1:22:57] they never asked me to sing it's not
[1:22:58] about you just like it's not about me
[1:23:02] it's about him let's worship him if I
[1:23:04] never get asked to sing and I probably
[1:23:06] won't ever get asked to sing but if I
[1:23:08] never get asked to sing let me be one
[1:23:10] who worships him who puts as much effort
[1:23:13] when I'm in the seat as I am when I'm in
[1:23:15] the
[1:23:16] Pulpit right I want to do that I I I
[1:23:19] purpos to do that in my life that I put
[1:23:21] just as much effort I listen I go to a
[1:23:23] meeting and get wore out back in the
[1:23:25] preacher that's just the truth of it I'm
[1:23:27] not saying you should be like me but but
[1:23:29] he's the theme of my life it's not about
[1:23:31] me I get just as excited when somebody
[1:23:34] else brings the word a lot more excited
[1:23:35] sometimes when somebody else brings the
[1:23:37] word as when I do right what is it he's
[1:23:40] the theme I don't have to be behind the
[1:23:41] pulpit he's the theme it's not me it's
[1:23:43] him he's the theme of our talking our
[1:23:46] thinking our singing of our walks he
[1:23:48] should be the Principal theme of our
[1:23:50] life if he's a principal theme of The
[1:23:53] Bible and the Bible is in us then he
[1:23:55] should be the Principal theme of
[1:23:58] everything yes we
[1:24:01] do think about that for a minute
[1:24:05] everything how can he be the Principal
[1:24:07] theme at the funeral home he has to
[1:24:11] be that make sense I can be a principal
[1:24:15] theme when I'm testing pavement well he
[1:24:17] he has to
[1:24:18] be right I'm at school whatever it is
[1:24:21] that you do I'm at
[1:24:23] home you you ladies are at home and yeah
[1:24:26] he's the principal
[1:24:27] theme he's the principal theme when I'm
[1:24:30] on
[1:24:30] Facebook the principal theme when I'm
[1:24:34] huh right he's the principal theme when
[1:24:37] no matter what I'm doing he's the
[1:24:40] theme and he says he's the theme of
[1:24:43] everything we do say or think yes well
[1:24:47] thatd get rid of a lot a a whole lot of
[1:24:50] our anxious thoughts wouldn't it
[1:24:53] if an eternal if the Eternal God if we
[1:24:57] recognize who Jesus is is the principal
[1:25:01] theme how could we be
[1:25:03] anxious right he's the theme of our life
[1:25:07] he's going to do what's best for me he's
[1:25:10] going to work it out it's going to be
[1:25:12] all right cuz he's the
[1:25:16] theme good he ought to be the theme of
[1:25:18] our homes come on oh God help me not to
[1:25:21] make with the theme of my home but to
[1:25:24] let Christ be the theme of my
[1:25:26] home as the musicians come brother Bram
[1:25:31] he talks about you've all heard the
[1:25:33] story but for you young ones maybe
[1:25:35] brother B tells a story about a magic
[1:25:37] flower you know that tells a story about
[1:25:39] a magic
[1:25:40] flower
[1:25:42] and it's just a story it's not in the
[1:25:45] Bible he tells a story about the magic
[1:25:47] flower and he said this man was poor and
[1:25:50] he found a magic flower that said said
[1:25:52] I'll give you whatever you ask for so he
[1:25:55] looked at a mountain that was over there
[1:25:57] on the side of uh and he said he said
[1:26:00] let that mountain side open up he said I
[1:26:03] want to go in he said and be able to
[1:26:05] find all the riches I could ever
[1:26:07] want and the flower said okay so he
[1:26:11] opened it up and he walks inside takes
[1:26:14] the flower with him you know walks
[1:26:16] inside sets the flower down and he gets
[1:26:19] some silver it's a whole pocket full of
[1:26:22] I'm go I'm going to go tell some of my
[1:26:23] buddies what I found man I I'm
[1:26:27] rich and the flower says but don't
[1:26:30] forget the main
[1:26:32] thing he goes back he grabs some gold he
[1:26:35] said I'll take some gold and I I I'm
[1:26:38] rich I'll show my buddies said don't
[1:26:40] forget the main
[1:26:41] thing he said I'm going to I'm going to
[1:26:43] run and and uh and get some diamonds he
[1:26:46] grabs some Diamond said don't forget the
[1:26:47] main thing finally gets tired of hearing
[1:26:49] it you know like sometimes you get tired
[1:26:51] of hearing the preacher and
[1:26:53] he say oh you just shut up and he runs
[1:26:55] out with his gold and when he does the
[1:26:57] mountain side closes up the gold
[1:27:01] disappears what was it the flower was
[1:27:03] the main
[1:27:06] thing the the gifts aren't the main
[1:27:08] thing the gold wasn't the main thing the
[1:27:11] preachers aren't the main
[1:27:13] thing are you with me now the prophets
[1:27:16] weren't even the main thing he was the
[1:27:18] main thing with all when you get all the
[1:27:21] gifts and you get everything else when
[1:27:22] you get everything in life maybe you'll
[1:27:24] get everything all your dreams will come
[1:27:25] true and I hope that they do but don't
[1:27:27] forget the main thing make him the
[1:27:30] principal theme of your life will we can
[1:27:32] we do that tonight would you bow your
[1:27:34] heads with me to begin to play something
[1:27:37] softly is the principal theme of our
[1:27:44] talking oh
[1:27:47] God I maybe a little repentance is in
[1:27:50] order for me
[1:27:54] maybe maybe my life would go a little
[1:27:56] bit
[1:27:57] better maybe I'd get along a little bit
[1:27:59] better with my loved
[1:28:01] ones if he was the principal theme of
[1:28:04] our
[1:28:05] conversations he was the principal theme
[1:28:07] of our
[1:28:08] life and I think it's not that we don't
[1:28:11] talk about carnal things we
[1:28:13] do and yet there's that overarching
[1:28:16] theme whatever we we don't want to be
[1:28:18] like the pig that sat Under The Apple
[1:28:19] Tree he sat there for years eating
[1:28:21] apples never did look up to see where
[1:28:24] the apples come
[1:28:26] from we we want to acknowledge Lord you
[1:28:29] give me these
[1:28:31] things Lord you bless me you you help me
[1:28:34] the Lord gives and the Lord takes away
[1:28:36] blessed be the name of the Lord David
[1:28:39] said I once was young and now I'm old
[1:28:40] I've never I've never seen the righteous
[1:28:42] forsaken or a seed begging bread I'm
[1:28:44] going to believe that God can take care
[1:28:46] of me let him be the Principal theme
