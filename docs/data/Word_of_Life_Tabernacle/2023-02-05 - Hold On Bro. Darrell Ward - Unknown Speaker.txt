thankful for all of you that could make it tonight I know there's several of our own that are gone or sick and so uh we'll be praying for you tonight and several that are watching tonight you just enter into the service whether you're here or watching enter in and just believe that God has got something to speak to you are you ready to hear the word tonight Amen brother Daryl Ward is no stranger to us I had it on my heart for a while to have him in it just worked out this weekend now he's made a sacrifice to be here they're opening their new church building this weekend but he made the sacrifice to be here with us so we're we're grateful for brother Daryl coming and and uh let's just reward that and uh the the man of God for coming by just listening paying attention and amending the word amen amen God bless you tonight as brother Daryl comes uh let's sing Phil my cup Lord I lift it up make that your prayer lift your hands to the Lord fill my cup Lord I've got a cup it's empty and I need your help tonight amen as brother Daryl would come oh feel my God [Music] foreign [Music] no [Music] no I feel my cup [Music] I lived in it [Music] this thing on my soul Friend Of Heaven yes Lord me too I want no more here's my cup fill it up and make me Hallelujah Hallelujah you know I'm so grateful that that's that's a beautiful song with a beautiful tune but what makes it so special is that it's something that our God can do it's really like a prayer amen because we serve the god who's able to feel more than a cup he can feel it so full that we're drinking from our saucers amen what an awesome God we serve tonight I said what an awesome God that we serve tonight he opens the eyes of the blind and he's mad he makes the lane walk he raises the dead he cast out devils Hallelujah he makes cancers disappear out of people's bodies that's the kind of God we serve tonight amen and he said a little while the world will see me no more the prophet said they have it for 2 000 years but ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you isn't that wonderful you think the you think about this brother brother Joe that The God Who created the heavens and the Earth and science says there's billions upon billions and trillions of stars just in our universe and they say there's universes out there multiple universes with billions and trillions of stars and the Bible says that our God knows every Star by name and The God Who was able to do that his desire was not to be above us not just to be with us but to be why can't we serve a God Like That the Lord Jesus kind of an honor to be with you and have a little thought on our heart we preached it here a while back but we just felt led to go this direction this evening so we trusted to be a blessing to you if you have your Bible start with us to the book of Second Kings and good to see each one out tonight and you know no matter what you're dealing with in your life I want you to look and believe that you serve a god who's able before this service is over to meet every need in this building amen Hallelujah I want to read now from second Kings chapter 4 verse starting at verse 25. praise the lord we appreciate the opportunity to be here and we trust that something will be said to help you and encourage you amen the Bible says this so she went and came into the man of God to Mount Carmel and it came to pass that when the man of God saw her afar off that he said to gehaza his servant behold Yonder is that shuttermite run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she answered it is well and when she came to the man of God to the hills she caught him by the feet but gehaza came near to thrust her away and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the Lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me then she said did I desire a son of my Lord did I not say Do not deceive me then he said to God he's a gird of thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way and if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother oh God and the mothers of the child said has the Lord liveth and as thy soul delivereth I will not leave and he arose and followed after her because she would not let go amen that's about our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes on a little thought the lord gave me a while back I want to hold on Heavenly Father how great you are and Lord what a privilege it is to Bow our heads to the Earth from which you brought us from to give you honor and praise and glory for Thou Art Worthy and Lord as we are in your presence this evening Lord we go to prayer for our precious brother that we just got a text Lord that's laying on his dead bed and the doctors are saying that there's no hope but oh we serve a god who's more than able to move for this need and I pray father by that anointed that raised my Lord from the grave may it move Lord upon this need may he come forth well from the hospital because that's the kind of God that we serve Lord I pray tonight in this congregation Lord no doubt there's needs but Lord there's not a need in the midst of us that's greater than you so we look to you tonight the author and finisher of our faith and oh God we pray May there come such an anointing Dear God that the people's Faith are so illuminated that they can rise up and receive that which you've already given them Lord for you are our God the author and finisher of our faith bless your children tonight Lord bless the ministers here of this congregation the officers Lord and the saints that assemble here and all the visitors and those that are streaming Lord may you just meet their needs we pray for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says God bless you may be seated Hallelujah you know I was thinking of those that are listening in I believe it was in Ohio that it was during the pandemic and a lot of people you know wasn't able to come to church and there was a sister that was listening in on the service and that night it kind of broke into a prayer line and people was coming up for prayer and so uh this next sister stepped up and I said do you need something from the Lord sis and she said oh actually I just came to testify she said I was streaming at home and the spirit of the Lord came into the room and he healed me amen that's the kind of God we serve friends Hallelujah I want to speak to you for a few minutes on hold on now hold on means to endure or to keep going in difficult circumstances and there's terms you know that was used that has the same meaning as hold on as if if only they could hold on a little longer in other words that have the same meaning is to keep going to keep on to last to continue to persevere to struggle on to carry on to go on to hang on to hold out to not give up to see it through to stay the course or as when I was in the Army we used to say sold your own amen stick it out hang in there all those have the same meaning of hold on so then that tells me the opposite meaning of hold on is to give up is to let go it's a surrender and we're living in a time when many are getting discouraged and they're walking away and they're turning aside and they're giving up and they're looking on the internet and they're seeing this and they're seeing that and they're getting confused and they're throwing up their hands and they're wanting to walk away but I say to you not Church hold on the promise is still true amen this is our day this is our hour this is our time in the Sun that God chose us for this generation that we would overcome in this hour that we are living in and I say to you this message is still true it's still right God sent a prophet Hallelujah and the words that we are hearing is going to bring us into a body change and I say to you tonight I don't care how bad it gets how ugly it gets how tiresome it gets hold on do not give up do not turn back do not walk away because we're closer home tonight than we were yesterday amen Hallelujah hold on oh The Best Is Yet To Come oh Hallelujah now let's shoot him out woman that we're reading about tonight to me she's the very definition of hold on because you see she stayed the course she did not give up but to get an understanding of this we have to go back into the scriptures to find out where the story starts you see this woman we read about in the Bible it doesn't even give us her name but it does acknowledge her faith and you know I say tonight I don't care if the world Ever Knows My Name but let me have such a faith in my God that they will have to acknowledge that man believed his God for the impossible come on somebody I don't want to be found believing God for a little bit I want to believe God for everything that I can believe God for I want to believe him for the impossible because when I believe God to do big things I'm telling my God I believe you're a big God my God's Not puny my God's Not we come on somebody My God is Awesome amen if they never know my name let them know that I was a man of God who had faith in my God it doesn't give her name but it does acknowledge her faith and it tells us where she's from she is a shoutamite woman from the city of sumaine now Humane means a double rest she was from the city of a double rest or two places of rest now Humane is a city of of in ascar I believe it is north of Manassas about five miles south of Mount Tabor and the great prophet Elisha would travel through this city on his travels and so it came to pass us she noticed this man of God that she offered him some bread and befriended the man of God and one day she told her husband you know I want to make room in her house for the man of God perhaps we could get rid of the TV said I want to make room in our house for the men of God so he can have a place to stay when he passes through that he can have a place to rest in the city of rest and so she made room in her home for the prophet and no doubt she called this room the Elisha room you know what I was looking at it and I thought you know that's a good thing for us to do for all of us from the pulpit to the back door is to clean some of the junk out of our lives and make more room for Jesus amen you know I wonder sometimes if we spend as much time with our face in this book as we did on Facebook if we all wouldn't be just a little bit closer to our God but we let so many things because of the technology and the things and the access to with the iPhone we let so many things come into our life that sometimes we find out we ain't got much room left for him but I say he should have the preeminence in every one of our Lives whether we're two or eighty he deserves first place the prophet said he'll take any place that you give him but he deserves our best after all he gave his best for us we should give our best for him get some of the junk out of our lives like Elisha told him to dig the valley full of ditches the deeper you dig the more water you'll get oh God help us to dig out unbelief to dig out fear to dig out doubt to dig the Clutter out of our Lives to make more room for the Holy Ghost to come in so she did this act of kindness for this man of God and the Bible said that he who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet right receives a prophet's reward yes the prophet taught us that God cares God cares for people who cares God cares for those who care for him you see devils are not cast out by anger but devils are cast out by love we got all kinds of Revelation we got all kinds of message books but what I find lacking so much among the message people today is the love for one another we should never let our love grow cold if somebody draws us out we should draw a bigger Circle and draw them back in we should be a people who cares because I tell you we are living in a nation that don't care no more amen did not the prophet of God say it would come to pass that the only love there was left would be among the elect oh God help us tonight he cares for those he cares for him as you've done it unto the least of these you've done it unto me and so what she done it so pleased the prophet that he wanted to do something for her and Geezer said Master she doesn't have a child and the prophet said bring her here and he said this time next year according to the time of life you will have a child and just as the prophet said she had a child in it was a boy and with this boy was about 11 year old one day he went out to the Papa's field to work you know the prophet preached on this went out the new Harvest and the prophet said he must have had a sunstroke because he grabbed his head and began to say my head my head and he got more sick and more sick and so the father being real busy where he told one of the hard heads take the land home to his mother and place him on her lap and so they took the little fella in and laid him on his mother's lap and she kept him on her lap to about noon and the breath went out of him and the poor little boy died and with this how could be Faithfully flesh Lord when this happened you know what she did she took him and laid him on the prophet's bed now there's a great Revelation there see didn't take him to her bed nor did she take him to the husband's bed but she took him and laid him on the prophet's bed in the prophet's chamber where the Prophet had slept now why did she do that oh God because she knew that whatever that Prophet touched was blessed uh saints of God tonight do you realize how blessed we are our lives have been touched by the hand of God we are a blessed people tonight he has given us light in an hour of Darkness he has given us peace in the time of Despair rest in a time of unrest Revelation in a time of insanity there's so many questions today and that's true but we've got something the world don't have they've got all kinds of questions oh God but we've got the answer I said we have got the answer to the devil's question you may not have a hundred dollars in your pocket tonight but we are some of the richest people in Arkansas because our lives has been touched by the master you didn't stagger into this thing God knew before the foundation of the world you would be a part of this our lives have been touched by the hand of the master amen we could stop right here and spend weeks just starting right here and going and letting people testify of the things God has done for us sometimes it's good to remember I said sometimes it's good to remember all the Lord hath done for us you remember I remember one time they we was raised poor I remember coming home from school and they had repossessed the living room furniture my mama was crying I thought one day I'll buy my mom a living room suit and I did and I remember that we got the second notice they was going to cut the lights off because the bill wasn't paid but we didn't have the money to pay it a dead mom went to church that night and when they come home Daddy felt something in his pocket and he reached his hand in pocket and pulled out you know what it was it was enough money to pay the light bill that's the kind of God that we serve Hallelujah [Applause] said to her husband get a servant to saddle them you and go forward for me don't discernment said don't stop if anybody salutes you don't you sleep them back but you go straight to the man of God up at Mount Carmel oh look at this woman's Faith that's it for it no matter how bad the situation was she wasn't looking at the situation but she set her eyes on the go don't look back don't get sidetracked don't stop don't listen to the doubters just keep going and her husband said it's neither New Moon nor is it the Sabbath so the man of God won't be there you're wasting your time he's not there it's over just forget it the doctor says it's too far alone the doctor says it's incurable that's what the doctor says but we've got Isaiah's report listen to me say to God listen to me young people every time you make a move towards God you're going to have discouragers you're gonna have hindrances you're gonna have obstacles to try to stop you to try to turn you back to try to slow you down but I say to you just keep going you know the prophet talked about Barnacles of disappointments when things don't work out the way we thought and we get discouraged and the prophet said Barnacles of disappointments and you know what Barnacles are it's those crusty things that get on the bottom of boats and I did a little bitty study about it and you know what I found out that they say that the Barnacles on boats actually slows the boats down and makes them hard to steer well how the devil likes to give us Barnacles of disappointment to try to slow us down to try to change our course but I say press on hold on Hallelujah keep going towards the goal [Applause] you're wasting your time Satan trying to turn you back but I say don't listen to the critics just keep writing get to where the word of God is being manifested when you find where God's word is being manifested you have found deity in flesh oh let me say that again when you get to where God's word for your hour is being manifested you have found deity in flesh amen Hallelujah get the word of the word of God is being manifested and when she got to where Elisha was he seen her coming and he said go ask her is it well with the husband now why would he say that oh my God why would he even bring her husband up you see there's an awe seeing eye that's watching you come on friends God knows whether you first before you come to church or not well Glory yeah we're all human put up your angel wings it's all right he said go ask her is it well with thy husband is it well with the boy is it well with thee look her son was laying dead on the prophet's bed she'd had a disagreement with her husband whether to even go there or not but in the midst of all of her disappointment and the death and the sorrow and the pain and the fear and the discouragement and the argument with her husband in the midst of all of it she said it is well and is there anybody here tonight who can testify it is well I'm having a hard time brother Daryl but it's well Hallelujah I don't have ten dollars to my name but it's well brother though she said it is well amen I like that all is well because she was in the presence of the prophet she said all is well because she was in the presence of the Prophet if she had that much confidence standing in the presence of a prophet how much more confidence are you and I have tonight standing in the presence of the one who sent the prophet come on Hallelujah brother Brandon's not here he's been gone since 65 but the one who sent the prophet amen the one who sent the prophet he is here with us tonight he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you in the good times in the bad times in the hard times I will be with you amen then no matter what we face in life we do not face it alone yeah you know I walk through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me all sights of God I say to you tonight always will you may be having trouble but all is well you may be sick but all is well you may be having great difficulties but I say to you all is well because we are standing in the presence of Jesus Christ foreign you see the trouble of the Dead some people you know brother I heard brother biscal say years ago that Jesus will be just as real to you as your faith can declare him to be and I thought that's so true because you see some people see Jesus every time they come to church because their faith declares him to be here some people come and never see him because their Faith Can't declare it you see it's not what we see with the eyes of our head because the eyes of her head will actually lie to us but we don't see him with the eyes of our head we see him with the eyes of our hearts and if you get an understanding that the God that was with Jesus the groom that same God is now with the bride yes it was God in Jesus form now it's God in Bride for him making him the same yesterday today and forever you'll be able to play the prophet of God said he went to Sister Rebecca's school play and there was one guy there who played three or four different parts it was the same guy but he would go behind the veil and change his costume and come out that's somebody else but it was him the whole time and here not long ago we was wearing masks I was in a grocery store I'd stopped to get a drink some gas and if they must have been this guy was a local guy and you know how everybody was wearing masks and I was standing over next to the potato chips and this guy comes walking into the store with his mascot and the cash register lady she goes she goes why John you've changed your mask and when she said that I about shouted past the Frito Lays because that Revelation struck my heart don't you see that's all God has done he's just he's just changed his mask they're all going to God Hallelujah she came to the man of God the Bible says and she caught him by the feet but gehaza came near to thrust her away he couldn't he said get off the man of God ain't it something even when you come to church those people still trying to discourage you you'll be trying to get into the worship and they're setting like come on he comes to get off the man of God leave him alone and Elisha said let her alone for her soul is next have the Lord hath hid it from me and he's not told me so for you folks that thinks God's prophets know everything I beg to differ with you see a prophet only knows what God will allow him to know you remember the valley that was full of dry bones and he asked Ezekiel hey Ezekiel can these bones live and what did the prophet of God say he said oh Lord God thou knowest I don't know Lord but you know and I'll know if you tell me Hallelujah [Applause] and she said to the man of God did I did I desire a son of my Lord was I the one to come seeking you for a child no you came to me did I not say Do not deceive me and then he said to God he's a good up thy Lords and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way if I meet someone salute him not if they salute the answer me not back and go and lay my staff upon the face of the child now that sounds pretty good but that wasn't good enough it wasn't good enough for her you know it's like that song we sung I got a little saying say fill my cup Lord but you know if we really got a revelation of how much God wants to bless us we would really sing fill my truck now some people might have some people might have been satisfied with the staff but why take the staff of the Prophet when you've got your hands on the prophet himself [Music] and why would we take some cold Creed Dead photos religion when you can have the real thing why would we take an invitation when we can have the real anointing amen and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and the Bible said he arose and throttled her yeah she must have been pretty persuasive oh no oh no she said I'm in your presence I'm not leaving you I'm holding on I'm not letting go of you you said God would give me a son if you spoke a son for me once you can do it again I'm not leaving you your saints of God if God's ever touched you once can he do it again if God's ever delivered you once cannot he deliver you again Hallelujah if God's ever healed you one time can I heal you again we serve a God hallelujah who raises the dead and opened the blinded eyes who turns water into wine how many times does he have to do it before we believe it when Elijah seen he had her on his hands there was nothing else to do but go with her and the prophet of God said he said if you'll stay with the Holy Spirit like she stay with Elisha she grabbed him by the feet and she wasn't letting go she was holding on she was on his hands and you stay on Jesus hands like that get on his hands and stay there if he loves you well enough to come to you and bless you and save you then stay on his hands you see the answer to every problem in this building it's not Google it's Jesus Christ he was the answer yesterday he's the answer today and if there is a tomorrow he will be the answer tomorrow he's the answer for cancer he's the answer for arthritis he's the answer for sugar diabetes he's the answer for high blood low blood no blood he's the answer he's the answer for rebellious teenagers sometimes we need to hold them do we hold them too tight sometimes we need to take that little rebellious child and just put him into the hands of Jesus well that's what our mama done to some of us and it worked out all right well preach brother I think you believe we will surely you Arkansas boys today man that let me be catch my breath I'm getting old the prophet said oh I like that when you take a hold of God for something don't you turn loose that's right just hold on to him if we could take a hold of God's agent God's agent then was Elisha God's agent today is the Holy Spirit then hold on to it when you ever come in contact and you feel the Holy Spirit on you then hold on to it I'll not leave you stay with it like Jacob did when he wrestled with the angel he said I'm going to hold on to you bless me until you give me the things that I'm Desiring notice it wasn't Jacob saying let me go let me go let me go it was the angel saying let me go Jacob said I ain't gonna let you go until I get what I have need of look God give us Faith like that today our faith is so wishy-washy we'll feel something go out testifying the next day we get up with a symptom and we think we didn't get it that ain't Faith that's hope faith will stay there and Proclaim I'm Healed regardless amen [Music] it was the angel saying let me go not Jacob oh God Give Me Faith to hang on to an angel like that he said I'll not let you go I like that hold on to him that's right he stayed all night with him you see her faith wasn't in the staff it was in the prophet and so she said as the Lord your God lives and never dies and your soul never dies I'm not going to leave you I'm going to stay right there with you I want to stay right here and the prophet said if you take Jesus for your healer don't you let no devil or nothing else ever back you out of it you hold on I'll stay with it I'll stay right there I don't care if it takes three people to get me out of bed in the morning because my back is hurting so bad that's got nothing to do with it you know what I did I got me a bar of soap and I roll on the mirror in my bathroom and my wife bless the heart she left it there it's still there for us to know and I took some soap and I wrote on the mirror he is my healer and every morning when I get up I see it every time I brush my teeth I see it amen because I want the devil to know I'm not believing the symptoms I'm not believing the back pain I'm not believing the MRI I'm not believing the CT scan but I believe in The God Who made this body and if he made this body he could heal this body come on somebody and so I'm going to testify of my God because he is my healer he is my sustainer he ought Hallelujah he gave me my breath and nobody can take my breath to he says so so I'm just gonna praise the Lord I'm gonna praise him in the good time I'm going to praise him in the bad time Hallelujah don't you let no devil or nothing else ever back you out of it hold on I'll stay with it stay right there as the Lord your God lives and your soul never does I'll never leave you till I find out about that baby well the prophet couldn't get rid of her and that's the way you want to be with Jesus we want to just get on his hands and stay there cry out day and night that's the way yes sir don't you turn loose don't you back up one bit if you believe it stay there there's Mercy in the Lord stay with it stay with it Hallelujah because you see we live in a we live in such a oh my an impatient age if it don't happen tonight we believe it can't happen you know I remember years ago when I played ball we all forgive me for that but I did play ball I was on a state championship team when I was 16 to pitched for him down in Oak Ridge Tennessee but I was playing for a team down at Eastman uh the corporation they let me play on their team I didn't work there but they let me play there I guess that wasn't legal but I did it but anyhow that's another story and then I'm confessing that I guess but they was two ball fields there in between the ball fields was a big water tower and there's a guy working on that Tower and these two teams were playing so this team got up and the guy pitched the ball to him and cracked and over the fence Home Run next guy got up he pitched the ball crack home run it got so bad that the guy out there in the Outfield was standing with this ball glove on his head and every time they hit he'd just do like this and the guy up on the water tower was watching and he yelled down to the guy out in the Outfield he said hey buddy what's the score and he yelled up to the guy and said it's nine to nothing he said you guys are losing ain't you he said I don't know we ain't batted yet [Applause] well I want the devil to know that I we're still warming up we're not we've not got into a good swing yet Amen Let he throw all the pictures he wants to throw we've got the we are the Home Run Queen I said we are the whole blood Queen we're running towards our homeland tonight [Applause] because hey man he could not get rid of her and you want to get on his hands just cry out day and night that's the way yes sir don't you turn loose don't you back up one bit if you believe it stay there there's Mercy in the Lord you remember the teaching about the unjust the the the unjust judge and he's talking about this woman who is constantly knocking knocking on his door she was so persistent he turned her away today she'd come back tomorrow she was on his hands again and again and again and again and he said I need to fear God nor man but This Woman's driving me crazy come on she told me it's me day and night she's crying after me and that's the way you want to get with God be on his hands in the morning be on his hands at night every day all the time just constantly seeking Lord I'm so happy asking you because I know you're the God who answers prayer you said to Jeremiah I am the Lord that heareth thee Hallelujah you said you would answer my prayer I'm just as happy asking so just knock a little while well I guess it don't work oh really amen just keep standing there Lord I'm here I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands I'm going to stay right there you get tired of listening but I'm having a great time talking because I know you're coming I know you're coming I know you're the god that answers prayer what did God say call unto me saith the Lord call unto me and I will hear thee you talk about a calling plan that's a calling plan yeah unlimited calling yeah [Music] yeah this ain't GE this is g-o-d this ain't a t this is eternity Hallelujah I said Hallelujah that's when something happens he has to get you off his hands so he comes out to answer you this little woman was Avenged because she cried out for it and how much more will God give them the Holy Spirit who will cry out for it day and night if you want the Holy Ghost then cry out for it [Music] how does the baby get what it wants it cries out for it we got faith to believe that God can do it and we'll do it then let's take a hold of him and hold on to him don't let go stay right with it if it don't come now it'll come 10 minutes if not 10 minutes It'll come two hours if not two hours it'll come tomorrow if not tomorrow it'll come next week Our Father Abraham believed God for that promised child 25 years we can't believe God 25 minutes and claim to be the seat of Abraham you see the key of it is it's just be found believing when it happens you remember the woman with the stomach trouble and the woman with the Gorder they went up in Chicago they went through the prayer line and the prophet pronounced them both well and they went home still sick borders still there stomach still hurt days went by but they testified and testified and testified and it got to the point the woman's stomach trouble her husband said would you just stop you ain't no better just quit and she said listen dear that man didn't know my name and he told me my name he didn't know where I lived and he told me where I lived he didn't know what was wrong with me but he told me what was wrong with me and then he told me I was well well if he knew all that did he know that come on [Applause] [Music] so she kept testifying you know the story she got up one morning and the kids left you know they left in a hurry didn't finish the oatmeal and she ate it didn't hurt she ate some toast it didn't hurt she drank some Maxwell House because it's good to the last drop and it didn't hurt and she got excited you know like us message people do come on now yes feels well I feel so good no no she went running up the street screaming and when she got to where the woman at the Garter she was getting ready to knock on the door and she heard and she went running in and the Garter was gone she was shaking the sheets looking for him you know what the prophet of God said the angel of the Lord was passing through the neighborhood confirming the blessing [Music] Hallelujah and when the angel came through what did he find he found that they were holding on he found that they were still testified and I say with the angel passes by for your healing let it be found let him find you believe it let him find you testify him then he finds you praising God not give any worship yes sir Hallelujah I quoted this last night at brother Bo's but I think it'd be good to quote it again tonight listen to this the God said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now the outside world wants you to believe as soon as you lay hands on them that crippled leg must straighten out you must jump up and down now the world wants us to believe when you come up here sick and be prayed for that instantly that blinded eye supposed to come open and sometimes it does we've seen that I've seen cancers disappear in the meeting yes I have seen a man down in Nicaragua we've been over at a 90 degree angle blowed his back out laying brick came through a prayer line when he got to the end of it he was standing up more straighter than I am he shouted that place to the ground amen but the outside world wants you to believe that as soon as that crippled leg is prayed for it must straighten out and that person's supposed to jump up and down but the prophet said he never said that he never promised that now listen this will help our faith the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God will raise them up but he never said when he said they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall Shout that means you expect it to happen they shall not could be not hope so not maybe they shall you know like repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's the same shall they shall lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover but he never said when you pray believe that you receive it and it shall be given to you he just didn't say when so what should we do hold on just hold on well brother there I was prayed for I feel no different hold on feeling has nothing to do with it like Elijah and Elisha and Elijah laid the man on Elisha while he was plowing out in the field now the mantle didn't fit Elisha but Elisha wanted that mantle so he took off after Elijah and he held on he wasn't leaving Elijah till he got that mantle he laid it upon it I said it wouldn't fit but Elisha held on for 10 years till God tripped him to fit the mantle and let me say tonight God will never cut this message to fit our petty ideals but he will Whittle us down I said he will Whittle us down until we fit the mantle [Applause] because this bride will wear the mantle he didn't already lie to the fifth the robe but he altered he ordered the excuse me I got that backwards he didn't order the robe to fit Elisha but he honored Elisha to fit the robe and he will cut us and mold us and shape us hey don't you see my brother my sister that's what the trials and tests of life is for you see God there is no trial there is no test that will defeat God's people that's not the purpose of it but it's to mold you and to shape you and to build your faith how do you build muscles by lifting weights a resistance you see if ever get home if every time we ask God God instantly gave us something you know what it'd make us a bunch of spoiled brats truth amen we got a bunch of them today in this nation well Glory I'm just glad it's none of our young people Hallelujah amen the Bible says be confident of this very thing he which begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ now when it come time for Elijah to leave the scene he asked Elisha what do you want you're holding on to me you ain't letting go of me what do you want notice what Elisha said he saw the anointing of Elijah but he didn't just ask for the anointing of Elijah he asked for a double portion of the anointing you see Jesus was anointed he healed the sick he cast out Devils it was one man anointed to do the signs and wonders but now that anointing has fell Upon A many membered bride and all around the world Miracles and signs and wonders are taking place [Music] Hallelujah he said I want to double portion of your spirit might become upon me and the prophet said that's the way to ask ask plenty God likes to give you just as much faith with the trouble of it is today the prophet says people say well I asked the father for so much but the prophet said don't be scared to ask him ask all you can ask he likes to give you just as much as you've got faith to receive you see God won't run out he's got plenty of just hold on to the promise now Elisha got the mantle and he goes back down to the river remember they went to the river Elijah took the man and struck the water water party went over on dry ground water closed back Elijah turned their lives and said what he want he said I want a double portion of your spirit and that she went up in a chariot of fire and the man who came down and Elisha caught the mantle and he put it on and after 10 years of walking with the prophet the man of fit and he goes back to the same river with the same with the same manner and he stuck the water and he said where is the god of Elijah he wasn't asking a question he was making a statement the God that was on Elijah it's now on me and the God that was on Jesus Christ is now in his church amen [Applause] [Music] a double portion the things that I do so you do also end greater and that greater means more shall you do for I go to my father and send my mantle back upon you where is the god that was on Jesus Christ where is the power of his resurrection the prophet said it's in the church today his promises are true let's hold on to him friends sold your own keep pressing on don't give up Don't Turn back don't let go don't get on the internet look at all that trash just stay away from it but I'm so discouraged well hold on to Jesus well the doctor says it's bad but hold on to Jesus don't look at the situation only look at the solution [Music] look to the wood grab a hold of the promise grab a hold of the promise like that black girl did down in Memphis down here in Jonesboro she's from Memphis but down here in Jonesboro Arkansas you remember the story she was blind and she heard on the radio that there was a man from up in Kennett had got his eyes sucked and her papa got the money and they charted a bus and they went up to where the meeting was right and when they got there to the meeting can I have just a little bit of time when they got to the meeting there were so many people outside the church that couldn't even get in discouragement spent all their money come up there couldn't even get into the church but her daddy said honey you stay right here I'll go find a Healer and she was standing there and somebody bumped her and she got lost in the crowd you know the story well the prophet of God said that come and got him off the platform eight days and nights he said I've been there just sipping some orange juice praying for the people because I had promised I would pray for every person but at the end of eight days there was more to pray for than there was the first day and he said but they come and got me because there's a woman out in the ambulance that they said were dead said they took me out around this way and put me up in the ambulance and the prophet prayed for the woman and God gave her life back to her and he said I come down on the ambulance and said no brother Brandon we'll never get you back the way you come we've got to go around this way and the prophet said you see how God works things but you know when I was listening to this story I got this little tidbit I want to share with you it was all these people come for the prophet of God to pray for him they were standing outside the church that they didn't have monitors they didn't have monitors so they didn't know what brother Branham looked like they didn't know brother better from Adam all they do there's a man in there praying for the sick and God was answering this prayer and here he was trying to get through the crowd to get back in the church and he was saying excuse me but yeah I saw if I didn't mean to step on your toes around I'm trying to get around this way and the people might have said but would you move I'm trying to get in there and see the man of God and the Very one they was wanting to see was passing right among them and they failed to recognize and I was thinking about that brother Joel and I thought I wonder brother Dale how many times has Jesus Christ passed right through the midst of our assembly and we failed to recognize him because we didn't see the mask that he was bailed by think about that they was wanting to see the very best but he would you move I'd try to get in there and the one they was wanting to see right in front of me and one day I think friends will rise just how close Jesus was to you sitting right there veiled in your son veiled in your wife found in your pastor vowed in the deepest and he was coming around through there and he heard this this girl and she said with someone to help me please would someone please help me I'm blind I've lost my father I can't see yeah the prophet said I God stood there where she would bump into me she said excuse me sir he said what is it that you want she said I'm lost in the blood and I'm trying to find my papa he said we come up here to see the Healer and he told me to stand right here but I got bumped and now I'm lost and I don't know where he's at he said you come to see the what she said they either he said surely you don't believe in that as many fine doctors as we have today he said but you see sir they can't help me I'm so glad what the doctors told me that they couldn't help my daughter I was glad I knew someone who could yeah you know this story means so much to me I had a blind child and the same Lord Jesus that opened blind bartimaeus's eyes opened Jessica's eyes laughs and he said I looked at her and I told her I said maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see he said you see how God blocks things exactly right why was I taken to the back and said she grabbed me by the lapels of my coat like that and she said are you the Healer are you the Healer and I said no sister I'm not I'm just your brother she said I want to see the Healer and I said I hope that you see him someday and I believe you will and she said what is your name and I said brother Branham and she said use the one I want to see and I said now no one knows it's me I'll pray for you but but don't let it be known I said take your hands off he said I couldn't pull her hands off of my lapel she was holding on for dear life and I said I'll pray for you I can pray if you'll believe and she said that's all I ask you to do they said we bowed our heads and while we were praying I heard a scream and she ran into that lot throwing people one way or the other and she fell on the ground screaming I who was what's blood can now see he said a few weeks ago I got a letter from her she said oh her eyes are 20 20. this was actually like 12 years later he was telling the story he said I just got a letter the other day and her eyes are 20 20. she doesn't even wear glasses or nothing said it's the amazing grace of God that does these things it's something that Jesus Christ gave to his church to enjoy the Privileges of good health but when the people saw that young black girl with her sight thou stood an old man with a club and twisted foot he said I know who you are brother Branham I've been standing here three days in the rain oh God Forgive Me Lord three days in the rain not 30 minutes in an air conditioned building on a padded seat but three days in the rain just to be prayed for I remember one time way up in the mountains of Nicaragua the place called mencona manchones there's a woman came there about 75 year old her leg was busted open she said it was leprosy but it looked like a diabetic ulcers to me but they told me that that woman had walked an hour and a half with her leg like that just to be prayed for I thought oh my God how could God not honor things like that he said I know who you are Brother Brad I've been standing here three days in the rain if you'll just ask God God will heal my foot what can be done at that time I said to him my brother if you believe Jesus died and rose again the third day to make these things possible hand me your club and when he handed me that club he wasn't kidding he meant it yeah I've seen with my own two eyes that Twisted club foot come straight and he jumped into the air and began to scream had four men rushed around me and people with mothers with their little babies tried to get in close enough just to touch that old raggedy coat and God was healing them it wasn't the Ragged coat nor it wasn't the one that was wearing it it was the Lord Jesus that's here this morning honoring their faith and I say friends if he under their faith he will honor your faith tonight if we if our faith can only declare that he is here he's here for you tonight he loves you he wants to minister to you then let your faith go just let your faith go to Believe In The God Who still works
