[57:35] father for all that's matters Lord as

[57:49] brother Ben says that my brother Wendell
[57:51] set a high bar amen and I told him I
[57:53] said well man come always coming after
[57:55] my brother both my brothers amen it
[57:59] makes a guy a little nervous but uh uh
[58:03] uh we're just going to preach the word
[58:04] of God Amen the book of Deuteronomy the
[58:08] uh seventh chapter and we're going to
[58:11] start at the sixth verse but it says for
[58:14] thou art an holy people unto the Lord
[58:17] thy God the Lord uh thy God hath chosen
[58:21] thee to be a special people unto himself
[58:24] above all people that are upon the face
[58:27] of the Earth the Lord did not set his
[58:30] love upon you nor choose you because you
[58:32] were more in number than any people for
[58:35] you were the fewest of all people but
[58:38] because the Lord loved you and because
[58:41] he would keep the oath which he had
[58:43] sworn unto your fathers ha the Lord
[58:46] brought you out with a mighty hand and
[58:48] redeemed you out of the house of bondmen
[58:52] from the hand of pharaoh the king of
[58:54] Egypt Egypt know therefore that the Lord
[58:58] thy
[58:59] God he is God the faithful God can you
[59:04] say that he is God the faithful God
[59:08] which keepeth Covenant and mercy with
[59:10] them that love him and keep his
[59:12] Commandments to a thousand
[59:16] Generations bless the name of the Lord
[59:19] you can have your seats this evening
[59:22] amen and we if I uh have a title I'm
[59:26] just going to title it he is the
[59:28] faithful God how many believes that he
[59:29] is
[59:30] faithful amen if you've experience God
[59:33] in any length of time through your
[59:36] lifetime you know that God is
[59:38] faithful amen now we know that we're
[59:42] living in a a a time it's the darkest of
[59:46] all ages and as the Bible has said that
[59:50] the darkness has covered the Earth gross
[59:53] Darkness the people
[59:55] and we're living in that day and and we
[59:59] realize uh through the message of the
[1:00:02] hour just how powerful this darkness is
[1:00:06] and how that darkness is deforming the
[1:00:09] people of the earth they uh uh and and
[1:00:13] and uh changing them uh from from a bad
[1:00:17] condition if we could say it that way to
[1:00:19] a worse condition amen and that's that's
[1:00:23] the power of darkness and it has caused
[1:00:25] a a a perversion and brother brandham
[1:00:28] touches this uh in in the message Shalom
[1:00:32] and he he talks about how that man
[1:00:34] doesn't seem to have that masculine
[1:00:36] touch that he used to have and woman
[1:00:39] doesn't seem to have that feminine touch
[1:00:41] that she used to have and he says you
[1:00:44] take man today men don't seem to be
[1:00:46] Burly like they used to be and it's all
[1:00:49] uh some sort of he says they want to
[1:00:51] wear suede shoes with purple and they
[1:00:54] want to act like women and he said now
[1:00:56] that is true and and he says it seems to
[1:00:59] be more or less like a perversion a
[1:01:01] woman wants to cut her hair off and and
[1:01:04] uh uh act like a man and man wants to
[1:01:07] act like a woman and he said yet you can
[1:01:09] talk to them and they're nice people to
[1:01:12] talk to nice people friendly socialable
[1:01:14] people but what's caused this he said
[1:01:18] it's that gross Darkness upon the people
[1:01:21] it's it's something that is pressed in
[1:01:24] to them ain't that right amen we uh he
[1:01:28] says the world is one of the most
[1:01:30] chaotic times of Darkness that it's ever
[1:01:32] stood in and yet it's standing in again
[1:01:36] the Most Blessed light that ever did
[1:01:40] Shine in aren't you glad for that amen
[1:01:43] so there's a people that is part of the
[1:01:45] gross darkness and then there's a people
[1:01:47] that's that is part of the light that is
[1:01:50] shining in and and so it's it's it's the
[1:01:54] the most evil time for some and it's the
[1:01:56] greatest time for others we know that
[1:01:59] the prophet said that the lid from hell
[1:02:01] has been lifted off of hell and demons
[1:02:04] are pouring in in every way in the
[1:02:07] nations in politics in the home in the
[1:02:10] churches demonology is is like never
[1:02:14] before ain't that right but brother
[1:02:16] bradam would say but now to you
[1:02:18] predestinated seed
[1:02:20] Shalom and that word shalom means peace
[1:02:23] ain't that right Shalom God's peace rest
[1:02:26] upon you because we're near the end now
[1:02:30] how many believes that we're near the
[1:02:32] end and he says now we're looking we are
[1:02:35] looking well who's that we well it's the
[1:02:38] elect of God it's that
[1:02:40] predestinated amen and he says we're
[1:02:42] looking forward to the breaking of a new
[1:02:45] day how many's looking forward to that
[1:02:47] that breaking of a new day we're we're
[1:02:49] looking forward to the breaking of a new
[1:02:52] day until there's something great that's
[1:02:55] laying ahead of us where the years has
[1:02:58] been Joy that we've looked forward to
[1:03:01] the pressing the coming of the great
[1:03:04] light so this darkness is pressing Upon
[1:03:07] A people but the light is pressing as
[1:03:10] well upon the predestinated and and and
[1:03:14] now that that the wrath of God is coming
[1:03:17] up upon this world and and tribulation
[1:03:21] is setting in and people are losing
[1:03:23] their Minds yet there is a people that
[1:03:26] is standing under Shalom amen looking
[1:03:30] for a great day ahead amen yes sir so he
[1:03:35] says see he says now we can we can see
[1:03:38] the coming of this great light and the
[1:03:41] breaking Over the Horizon uh the hor
[1:03:44] horizonal uh uh Rim it's breaking
[1:03:47] between Mortal and immortality we see it
[1:03:50] breaking between the heavens and earth
[1:03:53] from an earth round sickness and
[1:03:55] troubled world into a bright shining day
[1:03:59] of immortal life and an immortal body
[1:04:02] and Immortal Earth that shall never pass
[1:04:07] away can you say Amen so the prophet
[1:04:10] would say shalom shalom to you little
[1:04:12] bride amen because this light is
[1:04:16] breaking all power of Darkness away from
[1:04:19] you can you say Amen you're not just uh
[1:04:23] uh uh exist in amen and the light and
[1:04:26] darkness affecting you but once light
[1:04:28] comes Darkness has to flee can you say
[1:04:32] amen amen so a prophet could stand in
[1:04:35] the most evil age and the most perverted
[1:04:38] age and cry out peace peace to this
[1:04:41] elect can you say Amen now all we can
[1:04:44] say about it is God is faithful amen the
[1:04:48] scripture tells us that God is alone
[1:04:51] exec uh uh Exodus 9:14
[1:04:55] God said there is none like me in all of
[1:04:58] the earth uh Psalms 8610 says Thou Art
[1:05:02] God Alone Now the Bible teaches us that
[1:05:06] there's none greater than God Amen
[1:05:08] there's nothing nothing equal to God
[1:05:11] Amen God is all alone Isaiah 40 and 25
[1:05:16] God says to whom then will you liken me
[1:05:19] or who shall I be equal saith the Holy
[1:05:22] One ain't that right see when we look at
[1:05:25] God we look at him far above amen
[1:05:28] separate from any anything of this Earth
[1:05:31] seen unseen God is God alone amen and
[1:05:36] he's faithful and that word faithful
[1:05:39] means loyal unwavering steadfast
[1:05:43] devoted dedicated can you say Amen so
[1:05:47] God is devoted he's a he's not God that
[1:05:50] just speaks something amen and just uh
[1:05:53] uh leaves it be but but he's devoted to
[1:05:55] that amen he's devoted to his creation
[1:05:58] he's he's devoted to his plan he's he's
[1:06:01] dedicated to his purpose aren't you glad
[1:06:03] for that God is faithful so he is
[1:06:07] steadfast and and and so if if he's
[1:06:10] faithful then there's no weakness in God
[1:06:13] Amen and for he is divine do you believe
[1:06:16] he's Divine and all that he is is divine
[1:06:20] so his his nature is divine his love is
[1:06:24] divine it's not just love it's divine
[1:06:27] love it's it's not just faithfulness
[1:06:30] it's divine faithfulness amen it's not
[1:06:33] just peace it's divine peace can you
[1:06:36] sayen it's something that cannot be
[1:06:38] attained by Humanity amen I don't care
[1:06:41] of all the achievements that man has
[1:06:44] amen you can never man can never achieve
[1:06:47] Divine amen man can come up with peace a
[1:06:50] for a temporary maybe take a vacation or
[1:06:53] maybe he may he lives in a time where
[1:06:56] there's no war and and there's peace and
[1:06:58] and maybe he's peace where because uh
[1:07:01] he's he's got money in the bank and he's
[1:07:03] got a fancy car he's got nice everything
[1:07:06] is going well amen but that kind of a
[1:07:09] pieace will never be a Divine peace amen
[1:07:12] we can be faithful to our wife we can be
[1:07:14] faithful to the job we can be faithful
[1:07:16] to the church we can be faithful Amen to
[1:07:19] to our uh whatever to our own little old
[1:07:22] plan but when it comes to God
[1:07:24] amen it's a Divine faithfulness that man
[1:07:27] will ever never ever know can you say
[1:07:30] Amen see so we find that whatever man
[1:07:34] has there's a weakness in man man can be
[1:07:36] faithful to a certain extent but then he
[1:07:40] breaks how many times we see marriages
[1:07:42] fall apart that have been together for
[1:07:45] 50 years and all of a sudden amen uh uh
[1:07:47] the wife wants to go or the man wants to
[1:07:49] go amen and what faithfulness there was
[1:07:53] now we see there there's a weakness in
[1:07:54] that kind of a faithfulness but there's
[1:07:56] no weakness with God when we say that
[1:07:59] God is faithful amen he will he'll
[1:08:02] forever endure his love will forever be
[1:08:06] amen his purpose for you will will never
[1:08:09] ever change God is faithful can you say
[1:08:12] Amen you see Divine is far beyond human
[1:08:17] comprehension human ways human thoughts
[1:08:20] human nature so this is why God would
[1:08:23] say my way are higher than your ways my
[1:08:26] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[1:08:28] and we could even say that God would
[1:08:30] tell us my faithfulness is higher than
[1:08:32] your faithfulness my love is higher than
[1:08:35] your love amen whatever I am is far
[1:08:38] purer than what you could ever thing
[1:08:40] amen that's the god that we serve amen
[1:08:43] see so we find that it is in absolutely
[1:08:48] impossible for man to be what God is
[1:08:52] within himself see it's in God's nature
[1:08:55] to be faithful aren't you glad for that
[1:08:58] it's just in his nature no one forces
[1:09:01] him to be faithful to you it's just God
[1:09:04] it's in his nature to be faithful to you
[1:09:07] amen it's in God's nature amen but again
[1:09:11] his faithfulness is far superior to the
[1:09:14] faithfulness of man amen now the
[1:09:17] position that god holds allows him to be
[1:09:20] faithful see because he is sovereign
[1:09:24] aren't you glad he's Sovereign amen I
[1:09:26] looked up sovereignty and it has to do
[1:09:28] with kingship or the supremacy of God
[1:09:33] Amen in other words he's Sovereign he's
[1:09:35] not bound to anything he's Sovereign
[1:09:39] amen that puts him above your trial that
[1:09:41] puts him above your thoughts that puts
[1:09:43] him higher than your purpose that puts
[1:09:45] him more in control than what you are in
[1:09:48] control of yourself he has the ability
[1:09:50] to turn the situation around when your
[1:09:53] back is is against the wall God is
[1:09:55] Sovereign he can step in any time and
[1:09:58] take care of your situation can you say
[1:10:01] Amen that allows him to be faithful amen
[1:10:04] he's not in Checkmate your sin doesn't
[1:10:07] put him in Checkmate your troubles
[1:10:09] doesn't put him in checkm God is
[1:10:12] faithful because he is
[1:10:15] Sovereign ain't that right first
[1:10:19] Chronicles 29:11 thine O Lord is the
[1:10:22] greatness and the power and the glory
[1:10:25] and the Victory and the Majesty for all
[1:10:28] that is in the heaven and in the earth
[1:10:30] is thine thine is the kingdom oh Lord
[1:10:35] and thou art exalted as head above all
[1:10:40] Daniel 4:35 all the inhabitants of the
[1:10:44] Earth are reputed as nothing he doeth

[1:11:31] Rebellion couldn't stop him you running
[1:11:34] away from him couldn't stop him amen
[1:11:37] your own will couldn't stop him your
[1:11:39] plans could not stop him everything

[1:12:04] by him were all things created that are
[1:12:07] in Earth and that are uh in heaven that
[1:12:10] are in Earth visible and invisible
[1:12:13] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:12:15] principalities or Powers all things were
[1:12:18] created by Him and for him aren't you
[1:12:21] glad for that amen that he did didn't
[1:12:23] just create something amen and then
[1:12:26] leave it to another to another being he
[1:12:29] didn't create you young man and then
[1:12:31] leave you to another uh uh uh to the
[1:12:34] power of Darkness uh but you were
[1:12:36] created by Him and you were created for
[1:12:39] him can you say Amen aren't you glad for
[1:12:42] that amen I'm so glad that he didn't
[1:12:44] just create us and then leave us Amen to
[1:12:48] to the world and leave us to the devil
[1:12:50] and and leave us you see God has the
[1:12:53] power power and he's been directing us
[1:12:55] all through our lives and you may have
[1:12:58] not understood it but God knows what
[1:13:00] he's doing can you say amen and your
[1:13:03] life may seem a wreck and you may have
[1:13:05] scars but that same God has the ability
[1:13:10] Amen to take your life and bring it back
[1:13:13] together and take every scar away from
[1:13:16] you for God is
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:22] faithful
[1:13:24] there is no one who can bring a legal
[1:13:27] dispute of his actions and bring a
[1:13:30] judgment against him to restrict him
[1:13:34] from carrying out his plan he is
[1:13:37] Sovereign in his creation he is
[1:13:39] Sovereign in his Works he is Sovereign
[1:13:42] in his choosing he is Sovereign in his
[1:13:45] word and his word is promises do you
[1:13:49] believe that so because God is Sovereign
[1:13:53] then he took the liberty Amen to write
[1:13:56] our names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:58] before the foundation of the world and
[1:14:01] he didn't have to ask you he didn't have
[1:14:03] to get your enemy's permission to do so
[1:14:06] he didn't have to ask the devil amen if
[1:14:08] he could do that he's Sovereign amen so
[1:14:11] he takes the Liberty by himself and he
[1:14:15] writes our names in the Lamb's Book of
[1:14:17] Life can you say amen amen he took the
[1:14:20] liberty to choose to predestinate
[1:14:23] amen and even to glorify us uh amen
[1:14:27] before you even took your first breath
[1:14:29] amen now we can't even understand that
[1:14:32] kind of sovereignty but God is Sovereign
[1:14:35] can you say amen amen so then then we
[1:14:38] find that this was not just God
[1:14:41] expressing his wishes and desires for
[1:14:45] our life amen so he writes say our names
[1:14:48] in the Lamb's Book of Life as an
[1:14:50] expression of his wish for us us no no
[1:14:54] no no this is his command for us this is
[1:14:58] his Destiny for us can you say amen amen
[1:15:02] he knew exactly what he was doing when
[1:15:05] he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:15:07] Life he knew he already knew what the
[1:15:10] devil would do with you he knew the
[1:15:12] trials that you would go through but he
[1:15:14] wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:15:17] Life and because he is faithful amen he
[1:15:21] can already set your end uh amen he's
[1:15:25] already predestinated an end for this
[1:15:28] church can you say Amen he's already
[1:15:30] done it amen see so it is his decree it
[1:15:34] is his decree that we should be not his
[1:15:38] wish that we would be but his decree
[1:15:41] that we should be can you say Amen now
[1:15:44] in the the message uh Christ is the
[1:15:47] mystery of God revealed Amen brother
[1:15:49] brandom talks about the three-fold
[1:15:51] purpose that God had first to reveal
[1:15:54] himself in Christ amen which was the
[1:15:57] fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[1:16:00] poured into Christ ain't that right amen
[1:16:04] secondly to bring that fullness of the
[1:16:06] godhead bodily into a people that he
[1:16:11] could have the preeminence the oversight
[1:16:14] and the leading amen but it doesn't just
[1:16:17] stop there amen the third is to restore
[1:16:20] the kingdom to its rightly POS position
[1:16:24] that failed by sin by the first Adam
[1:16:27] back to where he walked in the cool of
[1:16:30] the Eden with his people talked with him
[1:16:33] and fellowshipped with him can you say
[1:16:36] Amen you see that's why we talk about a
[1:16:38] millennium that's why we talk about a
[1:16:41] new Heaven and a new Earth because that
[1:16:43] is part of God's plan for us can you say
[1:16:46] amen that's why amen God would never
[1:16:49] save you fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:51] and let this gross Darkness come upon
[1:16:54] your life only to obliviate everything
[1:16:56] that he done oh no no no God's got a
[1:16:59] purpose for you amen and he's told us
[1:17:02] not that he only just call us and not
[1:17:04] only did he save us but he's already got
[1:17:07] a place prepared for
[1:17:10] us I say God is
[1:17:13] [Applause]

[1:17:46] us from this message he's tried for

[1:23:38] faithfulness is eternal so if God is
[1:23:41] eternal he can't
[1:23:47] change contined without intermission
[1:23:49] endless Timeless existing at all times
[1:23:54] now we we can believe that God exists at
[1:23:56] all times but what about his
[1:23:58] love so God love so Lov it's all right
[1:24:01] that exists but now what about his love
[1:24:03] to
[1:24:04] us now then we played the game he loves
[1:24:07] me he loves me not he loves me he loves

[1:24:47] love of God one little inkling of a Time
[1:24:51] amen that's enough Amen to last you for
[1:24:54] eternity amen God would never show his
[1:24:56] love to you only to turn his back from
[1:25:00] you can you say Amen all through the
[1:25:03] scriptures you'll find that God was
[1:25:05] always seeking for reconciliation God
[1:25:08] was always providing a way to bring you
[1:25:11] back can you say Amen because he is
[1:25:14] eternal and he cannot
[1:25:17] [Music]

[1:25:25] be then everything that comes from him
[1:25:28] is eternal his thoughts are Eternal his
[1:25:32] word which comes out of his mouth is
[1:25:34] eternal can you say Amen his faith his
[1:25:37] love his strength his peace his Joy

[1:26:20] at the lowest step of your life that God

[1:26:37] eternal plan and purpose cannot
[1:26:40] lie his eternal love Eternal Joy cannot
[1:26:44] lie can you say
[1:26:46] Amen so therefore he cannot be faithful
[1:26:49] in one thing of your life amen and not
[1:26:51] faithful in another thing
[1:26:54] can you say Amen yes sir see amen he
[1:26:57] cannot be faithful in the saving of the
[1:26:59] soul and not faithful in the healing of
[1:27:01] your body that's why we can believe him
[1:27:03] if you can believe God to save your soul
[1:27:05] then you can believe God to heal your
[1:27:07] body if you can believe God to heal your
[1:27:10] body you can believe God Amen to save

[1:27:42] you
[1:27:43] tomorrow he cannot have a place prepared
[1:27:45] for you today only to turn you down
[1:27:48] tomorrow can you say Amen in John 14 and
[1:27:52] two Jesus said I go to prepare a place
[1:27:54] for you and if I go to prepare a place
[1:27:56] for you I will come
[1:27:59] [Applause]
[1:28:00] again and receive you unto myself that
[1:28:03] where I am you may be there also he's
[1:28:06] not building a place separate from him
[1:28:09] amen he wants you to be with him and
[1:28:11] that's the whole point of repairing the
[1:28:13] place is that you can be with him and
[1:28:17] dwell not temporarily but for eternity
[1:28:21] how many's looking for that light is
[1:28:23] pressing on we've got something that's
[1:28:25] looking ahead something darkness is
[1:28:29] covering the world but God is
[1:28:36] faithful you see I go to prepare a place
[1:28:39] for you if he said you then that means
[1:28:41] you don't put it off for somebody else
[1:28:45] look in the mirror and say that's me me
[1:28:49] well this me this is the mirror this is
[1:28:52] the mirror can you see yourself in the
[1:28:54] mirror can you say mama that's me he's
[1:28:57] prepared me a
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:01] place then that's why the prophet said
[1:29:04] no one can take your
[1:29:06] place that's right you believe it no one
[1:29:10] because God is faithful he's Eternal he
[1:29:12] cannot lie see James 1:17 there is no
[1:29:17] variableness come on in other words
[1:29:19] there's no
[1:29:20] changing neither shadow of turning with
[1:29:23] the Father of Lights in other words with
[1:29:26] the one who gives
[1:29:28] light can you say man amen he's the one
[1:29:31] that brought the light Rise and Shine
[1:29:33] for thy light has come well where do the
[1:29:36] light come from the father have sent the
[1:29:38] light and in him there is no Shadow

[1:29:43] him to shine the light in you brother
[1:29:46] Vernon you're shining you're walking in
[1:29:47] the light and there's a reason that God

[1:29:51] walking in the light and not in Gross
[1:29:53] Darkness he went to prepare a place for
[1:29:56] you and if I come again I'm going to
[1:29:58] come again and receive you I I just you
[1:30:02] just have to excuse me but I believe
[1:30:03] that's what Revelations 10:1 is all
[1:30:05] about the mighty angel coming down and
[1:30:08] it's the magnet as brother brand talked
[1:30:10] about that magnet sweeping amen and all
[1:30:13] them little particles coming he's
[1:30:14] Sweeping in this age and he's drawing us

[1:30:21] Darkness for you there's light there's a
[1:30:24] millennium for you there's a heaven for
[1:30:27] you there's a new Earth for you where
[1:30:29] there ain't going to be no Sor there's
[1:30:31] no disappointment there's no heartache
[1:30:34] oh thy light has
[1:30:37] come because
[1:30:39] God God is
[1:30:42] faithful sir brother brah said God has
[1:30:45] never had a new thought about anything
[1:30:48] because all of his thoughts he has
[1:30:49] always had and always will have and
[1:30:53] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:30:56] he's God thus the thoughts of God are
[1:30:58] Eternal and they are real they're not
[1:31:02] simply like a man with a blueprint he is
[1:31:05] drawn up which one day will be
[1:31:07] translated into substance and form but
[1:31:10] they are already real and eternal and
[1:31:14] part of God can you say Amen in Isaiah
[1:31:18] 5511 God says the word that goes forth
[1:31:21] out of my mouth
[1:31:22] it shall not return unto me void but it
[1:31:25] shall accomplish that which I please and
[1:31:28] it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[1:31:31] sent it can you say Amen Jesus said
[1:31:34] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:31:37] word shall never pass away ain't that
[1:31:40] right so here in Hebrews 10 and 23 Paul
[1:31:44] tells us let us hold fast the profession
[1:31:50] of our faith without
[1:31:54] wavering for he is faithful that promise
[1:31:57] can you say Amen see he made the promise
[1:32:01] amen and he's faithful to that promise
[1:32:04] amen see so therefore now we looking at
[1:32:07] that promise are required to hold fast
[1:32:12] amen hold fast our confession that word
[1:32:15] profession means confession ain't that
[1:32:17] right and and without wavering notice
[1:32:21] let hold fast keep secure grab and hold
[1:32:25] tight amen the profession or confession
[1:32:29] of our faith without wavering now we're
[1:32:32] required to be
[1:32:34] faithful your confession must be
[1:32:37] faithful don't you let it waver in and
[1:32:39] out amen don't you let it be well he
[1:32:42] loves me today he I don't know about
[1:32:44] tomorrow I don't know this I believe God
[1:32:47] is for me but now I don't know I believe
[1:32:49] I'm going in a Rapture today day you
[1:32:51] know we feel all good and then when the
[1:32:54] when when the Trials come we just don't
[1:32:56] know God help us not to let our our
[1:33:00] confession of Faith
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:05] waver well why shouldn't it waver for he
[1:33:08] is
[1:33:09] faithful that
[1:33:11] promised can you say Amen you see he
[1:33:15] made the promise so for us to see his
[1:33:18] faithfulness we must know what he
[1:33:19] promised you see because God is Not
[1:33:22] faithful to a man's word he isn't
[1:33:24] faithful to negative thoughts that we
[1:33:27] entertain he isn't faithful to our
[1:33:29] discouragement and our unbelief I'm
[1:33:32] going to be honest he isn't faithful to
[1:33:33] your sins either he's not faithful to
[1:33:36] your mistakes and your your failures and
[1:33:39] he's not even faithful to your sickness
[1:33:42] and my sickness can you say man we have
[1:33:44] our ups and downs constantly amen we we
[1:33:47] we're just living in a in in a human
[1:33:49] body amen that is sub subject to all
[1:33:52] kinds of things amen but God's not even
[1:33:54] faithful to that he's faithful to his
[1:33:57] word concerning you Hallelujah can you
[1:34:00] say Amen see so then when we start
[1:34:03] looking outside of what he promised then
[1:34:05] we lose the sight of the reality of his
[1:34:09] faithfulness if you look at what other
[1:34:11] people think of you instead of looking
[1:34:14] what God says about you then you're
[1:34:16] going to lose the reality of God's
[1:34:18] faithfulness because what they say about
[1:34:20] you God is not obligated to what they
[1:34:24] think about you God's not obligated
[1:34:27] to can you say Amen what do you say
[1:34:31] about yourself God's not obligated to
[1:34:35] he's obligated to his
[1:34:38] word is this all
[1:34:40] right obligated to his
[1:34:43] word amen see so you
[1:34:47] know did did did did God call us only to
[1:34:50] forget about us
[1:34:52] on did he save us only to lose us did he
[1:34:56] show his love to us only to turn us away
[1:34:59] come on Church did he commission us only
[1:35:02] to condemn us at the end you know
[1:35:05] brother BR said someone someone asked
[1:35:07] him said brother Bram aren't you afraid
[1:35:09] to make such statements as that he said
[1:35:11] no sir I've stood before tens of
[1:35:12] thousands critics sitting everywhere and

[1:35:41] we're not living in the days of playing
[1:35:43] Church we're living in the days when
[1:35:46] Christ is making himself manifest to his
[1:35:49] church to prove through his word that he
[1:35:53] might be fulfilled amen the things that
[1:35:56] I do shall you do
[1:35:59] also God not playing
[1:36:02] games God didn't play games when he sent
[1:36:05] this prophet he didn't play games when

[1:36:58] God won't leave me oh yeah can you sayen
[1:37:02] he says I'm I don't have much confidence
[1:37:04] in anybody that's too afraid to do
[1:37:05] anything I'd rather be found a failure
[1:37:08] than too lazy to

[1:37:12] try thank God for you pastors that ain't
[1:37:15] too lazy to

[1:37:52] speak his word but he's faithful to
[1:37:53] believe his own
[1:37:55] word do you believe
[1:37:57] it so therefore let's hold fast the
[1:38:00] confession our faith without wavering
[1:38:03] without fluctuating in opinion in
[1:38:06] Allegiance or
[1:38:08] Direction that's right don't don't don't

[1:38:18] on come on he's mighty
[1:38:22] what about your when your valleys now
[1:38:25] don't let that opinion
[1:38:26] fluctuate be faithful to
[1:38:29] him can you say Amen when everything
[1:38:32] falls apart and all hell breaks loose
[1:38:34] don't let your confession of Faith waver
[1:38:37] in your opinion of God in your opinion
[1:38:40] of his word his word will come to pass I
[1:38:43] don't know when I don't know how I don't
[1:38:45] know where but it will come to
[1:38:49] pass he's faith
[1:38:52] I hope this is was helping he's
[1:38:54] faithful you realize he'll move
[1:38:57] mountains to show that he's faithful to
[1:38:58] his word he moved the Red Sea one time
[1:39:01] because to show he's
[1:39:05] faithful he entered into a a fiery
[1:39:08] furnace one time to prove that he's
[1:39:11] faithful he went into a lions then to
[1:39:13] shut that mouth them Lion's mouths to
[1:39:16] prove he's
[1:39:20] faithful say Amen you realize when
[1:39:23] Christ walked the Earth he came to
[1:39:25] fulfill the word of God what was he he
[1:39:28] was God's Masterpiece I'm getting
[1:39:30] somewhere we're going to hurry up amen
[1:39:33] but see the prophet said when God made
[1:39:34] his first Masterpiece Adam he put him
[1:39:38] behind the word ain't that right but
[1:39:41] here he made another Masterpiece which
[1:39:43] was Jesus Christ and he didn't put him
[1:39:46] behind the word he was the
[1:39:50] word can you say amen God was showing
[1:39:53] himself as a faithful God that he made
[1:39:56] him not just put him behind the word
[1:39:58] this masterpiece would be the
[1:40:02] word yes sir Adam was the was the type
[1:40:06] Christ was the Fulfillment can you say
[1:40:08] Amen what was Christ the son of man made
[1:40:11] flesh the word made flesh son of man
[1:40:13] everybody say son of man the word made
[1:40:16] flesh amen the word made flesh amen what
[1:40:20] word every word that the prophet spoke
[1:40:22] of of Messiah Christ was it can you say
[1:40:25] Amen every type and every shadow of the
[1:40:27] Lamb the sacrifice the priest and the
[1:40:30] Altar and the Tabernacle and all Christ
[1:40:32] was it he fulfilled it he was the word
[1:40:36] made
[1:40:37] Flesh on can you say Amen so what God
[1:40:41] had in his mind concerning Redemption
[1:40:44] Christ fulfilled it not just putting
[1:40:47] behind the word he was the word amen and
[1:40:50] what is redemption is to bring back to
[1:40:52] its original condition that which has
[1:40:54] fallen ain't that right so therefore
[1:40:56] Christ fulfilled every word of God that
[1:40:59] was spoken of him to do it but he didn't
[1:41:02] do it alone everybody say it with me he
[1:41:05] didn't do it alone he was human but he
[1:41:08] didn't do it alone he was a man but he
[1:41:11] didn't do it alone can you say amen for
[1:41:14] the Bible says it was God the faithful
[1:41:17] God that was in Christ in iling the
[1:41:21] world unto himself ain't that right
[1:41:24] another place it says the fullness of
[1:41:26] the godhead bodily dwelt in him ain't
[1:41:30] that right so therefore Jesus was the
[1:41:33] tabernacle or the body of God Amen that
[1:41:36] God dwelt in so God thought of himself
[1:41:40] as bridegroom can you say amen and in
[1:41:43] that body he fulfilled that God thought
[1:41:47] of himself being tangible and there he
[1:41:49] was in Christ
[1:41:51] for Jesus says he that has seen the
[1:41:53] father or has seen me has seen the
[1:41:57] father can you say amen amen for the
[1:42:00] father dwelleth in me see it's the only
[1:42:03] way that God could be a redeemer was to
[1:42:06] become
[1:42:08] human ain't that right so then he become
[1:42:12] Redeemer but why did he become Redeemer
[1:42:15] to redeem that which was
[1:42:18] Fallen can you say man so in other words
[1:42:21] the plan did or the story his purpose
[1:42:24] did not stop with Jesus Christ the 2,000
[1:42:26] years ago he was making a way to fulfill
[1:42:29] his plan he was making a way through
[1:42:32] Christ amen to fulfill his
[1:42:36] plan can you say amen he knew you was
[1:42:42] coming brother he's
[1:42:46] faithful can you say Amen so we we find
[1:42:50] you know the prophet talked a lot about
[1:42:52] the Samaritan
[1:42:54] woman and he said is in the fall you
[1:42:57] know this woman got all messed up but
[1:43:00] God had her in his thinking before the
[1:43:02] foundation of the world and he come to
[1:43:04] cleanse her ain't that right so here in
[1:43:07] Hebrews 2:17 wherefore in all things it
[1:43:11] behooved him to be made like unto his
[1:43:14] Brethren that he might be a merciful and
[1:43:18] faithful high priest aren't you glad you
[1:43:20] got a faithful high priest he's a
[1:43:23] merciful high priest but he's a faithful
[1:43:25] high priest his Mercy will never
[1:43:30] fail are you with me now amen and you
[1:43:33] know what a high priest is for is to
[1:43:34] make
[1:43:36] intercession
[1:43:38] thank every time you make a mistake
[1:43:42] there's an
[1:43:47] intercessor is it
[1:43:49] truth yeah he's a faithful high
[1:43:53] priest in other words how can you fail
[1:43:56] how can you
[1:43:57] lose he's a faithful
[1:44:00] [Applause]
[1:44:03] God he went to back for you before you
[1:44:06] even breathe your first
[1:44:07] breath and then he finish it before you
[1:44:10] finish your breathe your first breath
[1:44:13] hallu we question if we're going to make
[1:44:15] it but God don't
[1:44:17] question he knows his own faithfulness
[1:44:20] he knows he can't
[1:44:22] fail it ain't about you it's about
[1:44:25] [Applause]
[1:44:30] him that he might be a merciful and
[1:44:33] faithful high priest in things
[1:44:34] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:44:36] for the sins of the people now brother
[1:44:38] brand said the predestinated is the only
[1:44:40] one that's considered in Redemption
[1:44:43] people might be making like and think
[1:44:44] they are but the real Redemption is
[1:44:46] those that are
[1:44:47] predestinated and and and and and then
[1:44:49] what does the Bible say we've been
[1:44:52] loosed he watched us or loosed us with
[1:44:57] his own
[1:45:00] blood he didn't leave it to an angel he
[1:45:03] didn't leave it to a natural lamb some
[1:45:05] old
[1:45:06] animal he himself came to be your
[1:45:11] Redeemer he himself created his own
[1:45:15] blood because he has the ability to do
[1:45:17] such he's sovereign he didn't have to go
[1:45:21] get dirt or whatever to make himself
[1:45:23] blood he created that
[1:45:26] blood to redeem you redeem you can you
[1:45:31] say man if he wasn't serious about you
[1:45:33] he could have just played games with you
[1:45:35] and let you go all your life offering up
[1:45:37] some animal go all your life shaking a
[1:45:40] preacher's hand go all your life just
[1:45:43] being religious go all your life just
[1:45:46] saying God sent a prophet but that's
[1:45:48] ain't what God's all about he's faithful
[1:45:52] he wanted to secure you he wanted to
[1:45:55] take you to where the devil had no right
[1:45:57] on you so he created his own blood and
[1:46:00] he redeemed you and then he loosed
[1:46:03] you how many's loosed you're loosed and
[1:46:07] the prophet said if it's a perfect blood
[1:46:10] that is loosed you then that loosening
[1:46:12] is perfect and
[1:46:15] complete then the devil has no legal
[1:46:18] rights over you say that with me devil

[1:46:23] no legal right over my home you have no

[1:46:30] legal right over my people can you say
[1:46:33] Amen it's a perfect
[1:46:42] loosening Hebrews

[1:47:44] priest he gave you the Holy
[1:47:48] Ghost but just because you have the Holy
[1:47:50] Ghost don't mean you don't need a high
[1:47:52] [Applause]

[1:47:56] backslide every day we don't mean to but
[1:48:00] we do we
[1:48:02] sin he said Christians sin

[1:49:11] faithful amen now Hebrews
[1:49:15] 7:24 this man because he continu ever
[1:49:19] hath an unchangeable priesthood
[1:49:21] wherefore he is able to save also to
[1:49:24] save them to the uttermost that come
[1:49:26] unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to
[1:49:30] make intercession for
[1:49:33] them can you say Amen now notice now but
[1:49:38] according to Hebrews 3:1 he is the high
[1:49:41] priest of
[1:49:42] our
[1:49:44] profession
[1:49:46] confession can you say amen amen he's
[1:49:49] the faith ful high priest of our
[1:49:51] confession brother Braham said see he's
[1:49:53] the high priest of our confession then
[1:49:55] he cannot do one thing for you cannot
[1:49:57] make any intercession until you can
[1:49:59] first confess it that it's
[1:50:01] done right can you say amen he said now
[1:50:05] is that scripture see high priest of our
[1:50:06] confession then he can only act when we
[1:50:09] confess ain't that right now I want to
[1:50:11] just say it there is no human being on
[1:50:12] the face of the Earth that has ever
[1:50:14] lived and will live and living right now
[1:50:16] that can ever accuse God of not being
[1:50:18] faithful that's right amen
[1:50:22] you see for when a man comes God's
[1:50:24] provided way he will see him in his
[1:50:28] faithfulness is this okay when a man
[1:50:32] comes God's provided way now God's
[1:50:34] faithful to provide the way and when a
[1:50:37] man comes according to that provided way
[1:50:39] he will see God in his
[1:50:41] faithfulness ain't that right you see
[1:50:43] first John 1:9 if everybody say if we
[1:50:47] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:50:52] to forgive our sins you see why the
[1:50:54] devil tries to keep us from
[1:50:58] repenting until you repent you'll never
[1:51:01] see him in his
[1:51:03] faithfulness but when you repent he's

[1:51:36] just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:51:39] cleanse us from all everybody say all
[1:51:44] unrighteousness you see God was faithful
[1:51:46] to provide the ark he was going to send
[1:51:49] judgment he it it was happening he he
[1:51:51] was going to send wrath he was going to
[1:51:53] destroy the world but God was faithful
[1:51:55] to that elect and he provided an ark of
[1:51:59] of Escape ain't that right amen see and
[1:52:02] then there was that elect that were
[1:52:03] faithful to believe what God sent unto
[1:52:06] them God sent them a prophet with a
[1:52:09] message and there was the elect that was
[1:52:11] faithful to that message ain't that
[1:52:14] right and when it was time to get into
[1:52:16] the ark they got into the ark and you
[1:52:19] know what God was faithful to that elect
[1:52:22] he made sure that that elect got to the
[1:52:24] other
[1:52:26] world can you say man that art couldn't
[1:52:29] that art couldn't float on its own
[1:52:31] ability come on
[1:52:32] now but God was faithful to them they
[1:52:36] were faithful to this message they were
[1:52:38] faithful to follow that message and God
[1:52:41] was faithful to them God wouldn't let
[1:52:44] that flood destroy them God wouldn't let
[1:52:46] them that that them waves and the
[1:52:49] turbulence and all of that s that Ark
[1:52:52] God was faithful and he brought them on
[1:52:54] the other
[1:52:56] side thank you
[1:52:58] Lord just before the death angel went
[1:53:01] throughout the land of Egypt to slay the
[1:53:03] firstborn God provided a token remember
[1:53:06] he told him you know the this Blood the
[1:53:09] blood shall be for a token unto you amen
[1:53:13] and when I see the blood I will pass
[1:53:15] over so over you so so the prophet amen
[1:53:19] God told the people what to do that they
[1:53:21] had to apply the token amen over over
[1:53:23] the house ain't that right amen see so
[1:53:26] they had to be faithful in applying the
[1:53:28] token they had to be faithful in what
[1:53:30] they were doing there see but then they
[1:53:32] got inside that house under the blood
[1:53:36] and they didn't have to worry they
[1:53:38] didn't have to fear they didn't they
[1:53:40] weren't popping nerve pills look at the
[1:53:42] world today anxiety is taking over the
[1:53:45] world today men's hearts are failing
[1:53:47] them for fear after looking other the
[1:53:49] things that are coming upon the Earth
[1:53:51] ain't that right but a Believer amen
[1:53:54] that's under the token you don't have to
[1:53:56] worry about that God was faithful to
[1:53:58] give you a provided way and if you
[1:54:01] faithful to keep that token over you God
[1:54:04] will be faithful he will pass over you
[1:54:07] and not one part of death will ever come
[1:54:09] to you spiritual death ain't going to
[1:54:11] strike your soul spiritual death is
[1:54:13] striking the world
[1:54:17] today yeah churches are without Revival
[1:54:20] spiritual enlightenment churches just
[1:54:23] people don't have that anymore can you
[1:54:25] say Amen but there is a bride's Revival
[1:54:28] and you know where that's happening
[1:54:29] under a
[1:54:33] token can you say Amen see so so you
[1:54:37] know the prophet said they didn't have
[1:54:38] to do anything under under that token
[1:54:41] they just rest in God's provided way and
[1:54:44] you know what the prophet said he said
[1:54:46] for them to be scared would be an insult
[1:54:49] to Jehovah
[1:54:51] see God provided the token he told them
[1:54:53] what to do and they're faithful to do
[1:54:55] that and then under that token they're
[1:54:57] shaken they're scared they don't know
[1:54:59] what to do I just don't know it would
[1:55:01] have been an insult to
[1:55:05] Jehovah you know the prophet says that
[1:55:07] people are afraid today because they're
[1:55:09] afraid that God won't keep his
[1:55:12] word can you say Amen but you realize if
[1:55:16] God provides something to us and we
[1:55:17] don't trust him to be faithful in that
[1:55:20] that's an insult to
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:23] him can you say Amen brother Ram said if
[1:55:27] if a man once under the blood feels
[1:55:29] afraid that God won't keep his word it's
[1:55:31] an insult to him you say well Jehovah
[1:55:34] perhaps this is your word but I don't
[1:55:36] know whether it's right or not oh shame
[1:55:38] on you why once under the blood he said
[1:55:41] I'm the Lord that Health Thee I believe
[1:55:43] it that's all don't insult
[1:55:48] him don't insult him I say to you you
[1:55:52] you ministers that's why we must keep
[1:55:53] the promises over the people keep the
[1:55:56] promises over the people don't care
[1:55:59] about what that church does or don't
[1:56:00] care what this one does or what this one
[1:56:02] does keep the promise over the
[1:56:06] people that they can see his
[1:56:08] faithfulness in his word preach the
[1:56:17] message will you allow me just a few
[1:56:19] more moments
[1:56:25] that's the Bible talks about a faithful
[1:56:28] people Moses was faithful in all his
[1:56:31] house Abraham is called faithful Abraham
[1:56:35] Peter in his writings mentioned a man
[1:56:37] named Sylvanas and called him a faithful
[1:56:40] brother there are several men who Paul
[1:56:42] mentions in his writings calling them
[1:56:44] faithful brothers or faithful ministers
[1:56:47] Paul even speaking of himself said that
[1:56:49] he was counted faithful of the Lord and
[1:56:51] was put into the ministry then he tells
[1:56:54] P Timothy this young Pastor he says the
[1:56:56] word that you've heard of me commit thou
[1:56:59] unto Faithful Men commit the word to
[1:57:02] Faithful Men ain't that right Paul's
[1:57:04] letter to the colossian church was
[1:57:06] addressed to the Saints and the faithful
[1:57:08] brethren in Christ his letter to the
[1:57:11] Ephesian church was addressed to the
[1:57:13] Saints which are at Ephesus and to the
[1:57:15] faithful in Christ Jesus brother
[1:57:17] brandham said it was addressed to the
[1:57:19] called Chosen and faithful in Christ
[1:57:23] Jesus ain't that right well according to
[1:57:25] The Parables that Jesus gives in the New
[1:57:28] Testament we find that at the End of
[1:57:30] Time amen when it's all said and done
[1:57:33] there is going to be a group of people
[1:57:34] that he's going to welcome in and say
[1:57:37] Well done thy good and faithful servant
[1:57:40] enter into the joys of the Lord oh you
[1:57:43] to think of that now faithfulness means
[1:57:46] something to God in this time of
[1:57:48] shifting sand in this time of of change
[1:57:51] in this time of ups and downs see
[1:57:53] there's an eternal quality that's been
[1:57:55] reflected in the people and one of them
[1:57:58] qualities is faithfulness faithfulness
[1:58:02] amen God will send you through trials
[1:58:04] amen but what he wants out of you is
[1:58:06] faithfulness can you say amen he may
[1:58:09] allow you to go through sickness but
[1:58:11] what he wants out of you is a
[1:58:13] faithfulness in his word a faithful
[1:58:15] confession amen he will allow you Amen
[1:58:18] to go without feeling him and feeling
[1:58:20] like you're backslid and even allow the
[1:58:22] devil to tell you you've lost you've
[1:58:24] crossed the line there's no more hope of
[1:58:26] Mercy for you but what God really wants
[1:58:28] of you is a faithfulness a faithfulness
[1:58:32] can you say Amen don't worry about the
[1:58:34] battles you're going to make it amen
[1:58:36] don't worry about failure you're going
[1:58:38] to make it but what God wants is
[1:58:46] faithfulness you see the elect is going
[1:58:48] to have the Divine attribute of
[1:58:54] faithfulness that's why I gave you the
[1:58:56] Holy
[1:58:57] Ghost the Holy Ghost just isn't a
[1:59:00] sensation the Pentecostal has made the
[1:59:02] Holy Ghost sensation but we heard last
[1:59:05] night you shall receive power after that
[1:59:07] the Holy Ghost comes upon you and that
[1:59:10] power is
[1:59:12] Authority that's
[1:59:14] right so notice now Revelation 17:14
[1:59:18] these shall make war with the lamb and
[1:59:20] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:59:24] the Lord of lords and king of kings and
[1:59:26] they that are with Him identified with
[1:59:29] him are called and chosen and
[1:59:34] faithful can you say Amen called Chosen
[1:59:37] and faithful ain't that right amen see
[1:59:39] called of God chosen of God faithful to
[1:59:43] God ain't that right so then how can
[1:59:46] there be faithfulness How can there be
[1:59:48] faith faithfulness in man alone what man
[1:59:52] can produce such faithfulness that God
[1:59:54] is looking for amen well you know here
[1:59:57] Isaiah 40 and6 says all flesh is as
[2:00:00] grass all the goodliness thereof is as
[2:00:03] the flower of the field the grass
[2:00:05] withereth the flower fadeth because the
[2:00:07] spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it
[2:00:09] surely the people is grass the grass
[2:00:12] Werth the flower fadeth so you ain't
[2:00:14] going to find no faithfulness in man
[2:00:16] alone but the word of the Lord Our God
[2:00:20] Amen shall stand forever ain't that
[2:00:23] right look through the history of
[2:00:25] mankind amen and see where there is such
[2:00:28] an a stability in humanity there's not
[2:00:32] anytime you look to man you're going to
[2:00:33] f you're going to be disappointed you
[2:00:36] believe that I know I know it's a shock
[2:00:38] anytime you look to a preacher you're
[2:00:40] going to be disappointed that's right on
[2:00:44] and anytime the preacher looks to his
[2:00:45] congregation he's going to be
[2:00:47] disappointed that's right come on
[2:00:51] now we don't want to be a disappointed
[2:00:53] Church you don't want a pastor that's
[2:00:56] disappointed and he don't want a
[2:00:58] congregation that's
[2:00:59] disappointed so we're not going to look
[2:01:01] at one
[2:01:04] another and I want to just say it to you
[2:01:06] now anytime you look to yourself you're
[2:01:08] going to be disappointed brag about
[2:01:10] yourself all you want to you're going to
[2:01:12] be
[2:01:13] [Applause]
[2:01:18] disappointed no charge for that
[2:01:20] one but church quit looking to yourself
[2:01:23] there's too many disappointed people
[2:01:26] there's too many unsatisfied people
[2:01:28] because they're looking at the wrong
[2:01:29] thing don't look to a preacher don't
[2:01:31] look to a personality don't look to
[2:01:35] nobody you ain't going to find the
[2:01:37] faithfulness that you're looking
[2:01:40] for
[2:01:42] sir faithfulness cannot be found in
[2:01:44] mankind and you say amen amen now the
[2:01:47] faithfulness that I'm talking about is
[2:01:49] is being faithful to God in his word
[2:01:51] faithful to believe the word faithful to
[2:01:53] follow and obey the word faithful to
[2:01:55] confess the word faithful to fulfill the
[2:01:58] word of God can you say Amen so so then
[2:02:02] then you know the prophet said it's the
[2:02:04] unbeliever that is unfaithful to the
[2:02:06] word yeah and I'm going to be honest how
[2:02:09] how else could we be anything else but
[2:02:12] unfaithful to the word in our human
[2:02:16] ability in our flesh we we we were all
[2:02:19] conceived in sin we were all born with a
[2:02:21] carnal nature the Bible says that the
[2:02:23] carnal mind is enity against God it's
[2:02:26] it's not subject to the laws or the word
[2:02:28] of God and it cannot be
[2:02:31] subject
[2:02:34] hello that's right so so a man can be
[2:02:37] religious and still be unfaithful to the
[2:02:39] word of God he can be a singer musician
[2:02:41] preacher Deacon whatever you want to be
[2:02:43] he wants to be and still be unfaithful
[2:02:45] to the word of God he can cast out
[2:02:47] devils and be unfaithful to the word of
[2:02:49] God he could prophesy speak in tongues
[2:02:51] and being faithful to the word of
[2:02:54] God what the Bible says not everyone
[2:02:57] that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter
[2:02:59] into the kingdom of heaven but he that
[2:03:00] doeth the will of my father see faithful
[2:03:03] ain't that right many will say to me in
[2:03:05] that day Lord Lord have we not
[2:03:06] prophesied in thy name in in thy name
[2:03:09] cast out devils and in thy name done
[2:03:11] many wonderful works and I will profess
[2:03:13] unto them I never knew you depart from
[2:03:15] me ye that work iniquity why they done
[2:03:18] all of the things that we are supposed
[2:03:19] to do yet they were not faithful to the
[2:03:22] word of
[2:03:25] God and you say amen and because people
[2:03:28] aren't
[2:03:29] faithful all right come on because
[2:03:32] people ain't got something within them
[2:03:34] to be faithful to keep them faithful
[2:03:36] they're going to be
[2:03:38] deceived just bear with me for a few
[2:03:40] more moments I'll let you go I ain't a
[2:03:42] pharaoh
[2:03:43] preacher I will let your people
[2:03:47] go come on
[2:03:50] but because if they ain't got something
[2:03:52] to keep them faithful they're going to
[2:03:54] be deceived and that's the problem we're
[2:03:56] living in the greatest age of deception
[2:04:03] ever ain't that right see well the Bible
[2:04:07] tells us that all who don't have their
[2:04:09] names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:04:12] written they're they're going to they're
[2:04:14] going to wander after the Beast and
[2:04:15] they're going to worship Him Revelations
[2:04:18] 12:9 say the Great Dragon that old
[2:04:20] serpent called the devil and Satan
[2:04:22] deceiveth the whole world but then Jesus
[2:04:25] would say but he that endureth to the
[2:04:29] end the same shall be
[2:04:33] saved now I'm going to just be honest
[2:04:35] with you it's the elect that's going to
[2:04:37] endure to the
[2:04:39] end can you say Amen Jesus already told
[2:04:42] us it's impossible for the elect to be
[2:04:45] deceived he's not scared to put you in
[2:04:48] this great age of
[2:04:50] deception he's
[2:04:52] faithful God is faithful can you say
[2:04:56] Amen see so therefore we may have we may
[2:04:59] have been born in sin having a vile
[2:05:02] nature and was under the condemnation of
[2:05:05] of of sin and death but it wasn't by our
[2:05:07] own choice Paul tells us in the Book of
[2:05:10] Romans that that that we were made
[2:05:12] subject to vanity not
[2:05:16] willingly but according to the purpose
[2:05:19] of God can you say Amen see we were a
[2:05:23] thought of God we were an eternal
[2:05:25] attribute ain't that right amen the
[2:05:28] prophet told us we went from attribute
[2:05:29] to the flesh to be tempted and tried
[2:05:32] that's right can you say Amen we had to
[2:05:35] know defeat we had to know sorrow and
[2:05:37] failure but that's not our
[2:05:42] end you may have been born with things
[2:05:45] amen that does not even look like God
[2:05:48] Amen but that's not your
[2:05:52] end that's only the temporary part of
[2:05:57] us do you realize the Bible doesn't call
[2:06:00] us defeated there is no place in the
[2:06:02] Bible where God calls his people
[2:06:04] defeated there's no place in the Bible
[2:06:07] that God calls us
[2:06:11] vagabonds hello Church there is no place
[2:06:14] in the Bible that God calls us a
[2:06:16] hopeless case the devil puts that in
[2:06:19] your mind but you'll never find it in
[2:06:21] the word of
[2:06:22] [Applause]
[2:06:24] God because that's not your end you
[2:06:27] might have started a basket case but
[2:06:29] that's not your end you might have
[2:06:31] started out a sinner and vile and and
[2:06:34] against God but that's not your end God
[2:06:37] is faithful everybody say God is
[2:06:40] faithful God is
[2:06:45] faithful for the Bible says the same God
[2:06:48] that's subjected us to vanity is the
[2:06:50] same God that also subjected us to a
[2:06:56] hope therefore 1 John 3:1 behold what
[2:06:59] manner of love the father had bestowed
[2:07:01] upon us that we should be called the
[2:07:04] sons of God not when you go to heaven
[2:07:07] and be called sons of God you're sons of
[2:07:09] God now now we are the sons of God not
[2:07:13] going to be now we are the sons of
[2:07:17] God believe it they are called in Christ
[2:07:21] chosen in Christ faithful in Christ
[2:07:23] brother Brown said they have been chosen
[2:07:24] before the foundation of the world and
[2:07:26] are abiding in their calling another
[2:07:28] place they are the ones that's
[2:07:30] resisted they resisted the devil's lie
[2:07:34] in the beginning they never fail in the
[2:07:37] [Applause]
[2:07:40] beginning can you say Amen so they're
[2:07:42] going to overcome do you believe you're
[2:07:44] going to overcome young people you're
[2:07:46] going to overcome par you're going to
[2:07:49] overcome preachers you're going to
[2:07:50] overcome Saints you're going to
[2:07:53] overcome no matter how bad it gets how
[2:07:57] low you feel how discouraged you're
[2:07:59] going to overcome but how are you going
[2:08:01] to do it Romans 11:1 I say then has God
[2:08:05] Cast Away his people God forbid for I am
[2:08:09] I also am an Israelite of the Seed of

[2:08:29] what a hopeless case I am I'm the only
[2:08:32] one left amen and they seek my life now
[2:08:36] and but what sayith the answer of God
[2:08:38] unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000
[2:08:43] men who have not bowed the knee to the
[2:08:46] image of baale can you say Amen you see

[2:10:09] it the Dynamics have come to change you

[2:10:20] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[2:10:23] an eye God is faithful to his word and
[2:10:26] in this day there's a people that is
[2:10:30] rising up and accepting the
[2:10:33] challenge Hallelujah do you love him can

[2:10:54] faithful hallelujah
[2:10:57] hallelujah
[2:10:59] hallelujah hallelujah can I ask you a
[2:11:02] question how many got a desire to serve
[2:11:04] the
[2:11:05] Lord amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you
[2:11:09] you know I find the the greatest
[2:11:12] thing among the people of
[2:11:14] God has Satan been able to tell them
[2:11:17] especially young people but he he hits
[2:11:19] us all one way or another but that
[2:11:21] you've crossed the
[2:11:24] line it's too late it's
[2:11:26] over I see so many people sit in church
[2:11:29] and they're Desiring more of God but
[2:11:32] Satan's got them
[2:11:35] convinced you've crossed the
[2:11:37] line and here they're sitting in church
[2:11:39] but you know what the prophet said if
[2:11:41] you've got an inkling of a desire to
[2:11:43] serve
[2:11:44] God it shows that Grace ain't over yet
[2:11:47] amen
[2:11:50] [Applause]
[2:11:56] Grace ain't over
[2:11:59] yet he said the fact that you're sitting
[2:12:01] in a church tonight yeah shows that
[2:12:04] you've not crossed the
[2:12:06] line you see you couldn't even have the
[2:12:08] desire on your own to serve God the
[2:12:11] prophet of God tells us that that desire
[2:12:13] is a creation of God there could not be
[2:12:16] a desire just born out of you from caral
[2:12:18] carnal your first nature it would had to
[2:12:21] be God the same God that created his own
[2:12:24] blood to redeem you to loose you is the
[2:12:27] same God that would work inward in your
[2:12:30] soul and create a
[2:12:32] desire and as you began to desire there
[2:12:35] was a God to answer the desire and a
[2:12:38] prophet called it the Deep calleth unto
[2:12:40] the Deep have you ever just H been out
[2:12:42] in the woods and hear a
[2:12:47] coyote and you just
[2:12:49] listen somewhere off in the distance
[2:12:51] you'll hear another coyote
[2:12:53] [Music]
[2:12:54] wo you don't know the
[2:12:56] language but there's communication
[2:12:58] that's going
[2:13:00] on something's
[2:13:02] happening sad deep calling to the Deep
[2:13:04] that's right you see the only way you
[2:13:06] could ever know that there's a God any
[2:13:10] you there's no man that could ever
[2:13:11] comprehend God and who he is but here we
[2:13:14] sit here with such knowledge of God it's
[2:13:18] because God created something within you
[2:13:21] oh yes and you begin to cry and you
[2:13:22] don't even know why you're crying for it
[2:13:25] it's because that cry is not coming from
[2:13:27] your carnal it's coming from that genan
[2:13:29] seed that God put down into your
[2:13:33] soul and it's calling for more of
[2:13:36] God but while you're calling there's
[2:13:38] another call coming and he's answering
[2:13:40] you and it's a deep calling into the
[2:13:43] deep deep calling into the deep you
[2:13:47] might have been a drunk you might have
[2:13:48] been a prostitute you might have been
[2:13:49] whatever you might have just been growed
[2:13:51] up in church and sitting in church all
[2:13:53] your life and not not not really having
[2:13:55] anything but then all of a sudden
[2:13:57] there's an Awakening God created that
[2:13:59] desire within you amen and you don't
[2:14:01] even understand why your friends don't
[2:14:03] have no desire they don't want but but
[2:14:06] all of a sudden you're just not
[2:14:07] satisfied with where you're at it's
[2:14:09] because God creates a desire and as you
[2:14:12] begin to cry as you begin to go more you
[2:14:15] couldn't be satisfied with the world you
[2:14:17] just couldn't be satisfied you go
[2:14:19] through so much in life you see there's
[2:14:21] so much hypocrisy in the message you see
[2:14:23] all these things and it should have
[2:14:25] blowed you away but there's something
[2:14:26] that's desired because you know there's
[2:14:28] a reality somewhere there is a reality
[2:14:31] of God that this Prophet introduced to
[2:14:33] us amen but I say to you there's a God
[2:14:36] that is here to answer that desire your
[2:14:39] desire to go to heaven you never been to
[2:14:41] Heaven you don't even you know where is
[2:14:44] it where is that how's it going to be we
[2:14:46] don't know but the desire desire is
[2:14:48] there the desire is there and God would
[2:14:51] send a prophet God would come and open
[2:14:53] the book amen not to he he Redemption it
[2:14:56] it's not about him coming to die for you
[2:14:58] anymore he's come to claim you it's all

[2:15:05] world come out of this mess come out of
[2:15:08] this confusion and you've answered the
[2:15:10] call I say to you your desire isn't
