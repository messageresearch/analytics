[12:58] out on the waters
[13:01] the storms raging high
[13:05] the waters around them
[13:09] troubled their minds
[13:13] fear filled their hearts
[13:17] they thought they would die
[13:20] they failed to remember
[13:24] the master was nigh
[13:28] he spoke the words and the winds all
[13:33] stood
[13:34] still even the waters
[13:40] obeyed his will
[13:43] and he calmed their storms
[13:47] just like he will mine
[13:51] if i just remember
[13:55] he lives inside
[13:58] so why should i worry
[14:02] why should i fear
[14:05] when this very same jesus
[14:09] he's always so near
[14:13] he lives in my heart
[14:17] and he hears when i cry
[14:21] i'll call on his name till
[14:24] the storm passes by
[14:32] we read in the bible
[14:36] how he walked with him
[14:39] brought light to the darkness
[14:43] when the way grew dim
[14:47] how great it would be
[14:50] to have his footsteps in mine
[14:54] to walk with the master
[14:58] all of the time
[15:02] and when trials come
[15:05] and death seems so nice
[15:09] just call on the master
[15:12] i know he'll be there on time
[15:16] and when sickness comes
[15:20] and my body's in pain
[15:24] all i have to do
[15:27] is call on his name
[15:31] so why should i worry
[15:35] why should i fear
[15:38] when this very same jesus
[15:42] he's always so near
[15:46] he lives in my heart
[15:50] and he hears when i cry
[15:54] i'll call on his name till the
[15:57] storm passes by
[16:01] why should i worry
[16:05] why should i fear
[16:08] when this very same jesus
[16:12] he's always so near
[16:16] he lives in my heart
[16:19] and he hears when i cry
[16:23] i'll call on his name till the storm
[16:28] passes by
[16:46] [Music]
[17:05] my boat of life sells upon a troubled
[17:10] sea
[17:12] ever there's a wind in
[17:16] myself
[17:19] but i have a friend
[17:23] who watches over me
[17:27] when the breeze turns into
[17:30] again
[17:33] [Music]
[17:42] and i know the maker of the
[17:46] rain
[17:49] he can calm the storm make the sun
[17:54] shine again
[17:57] i know the master of
[18:00] the wind
[18:04] sometimes i sword like an eagle to
[18:09] the sky among the peace my soul
[18:14] can be found
[18:19] an unexpected storm
[18:22] may drive me from the heights
[18:26] brings me low but never brings
[18:30] me down
[18:34] for i know the master of the wind
[18:42] i know the maker of the
[18:45] rain
[18:49] he can calm the storm
[18:52] make the sun shine again
[18:56] [Music]
[19:04] i know the master of the wind
[19:11] and i know the maker of the
[19:15] rain

[23:05] have to pass it around for kovid
[23:07] so uh i trust maybe the words will be
[23:09] good enough so hey man we appreciate you
[23:11] buddy
[23:11] can't shake hands hey man give him
[23:15] another hand
[23:22] god bless you brother david i appreciate
[23:24] you and all that you do
[23:25] to help us and all of you it's your
[23:27] wonderful church family
[23:28] you can be seated just for a moment i've
[23:30] got several things i want to talk about
[23:32] i don't like doing this i like to come
[23:34] out here and preach
[23:36] but there's some things we need to say
[23:37] and and uh it's good to be in the house
[23:40] of the lord this morning
[23:41] and there's no place i'd rather be on my
[23:43] birthday or any other day
[23:45] than to be in the house of the lord and
[23:50] we had you probably noticed there's a
[23:55] a notice on the board
[23:59] back there about information on the
[24:01] governor's mask
[24:02] mandate some of you have asked me about
[24:04] that and i just wanted to go over a
[24:05] couple of things on that i won't read
[24:06] the whole thing
[24:08] but you can read it it's on the board in
[24:10] the back and
[24:11] also put it on whatsapp so that you can
[24:13] have it on there
[24:14] um we um
[24:18] the mask mandate of course affects us
[24:22] and um the good news is that
[24:25] the people the the mandate states that
[24:28] people who are engaged in religious
[24:30] worship activities which i guess you
[24:31] could say that's what this
[24:32] is are exempt from the law
[24:36] although they strongly encourage face
[24:37] coverings now the thing is
[24:39] the the word there is engaged in
[24:42] and that doesn't cover us outside of the
[24:44] building and so what happens were what
[24:47] could happen theoretically
[24:49] if the local sheriff or whoever decided
[24:51] to enforce the law
[24:52] they could come up here and sit outside
[24:54] the building and give right a ticket for
[24:56] a hundred dollars to every person to
[24:57] come out of the building without a mask
[24:59] on
[24:59] they couldn't do that to us in here but
[25:01] they could outside
[25:03] and so i sent this with aaron mcgarry
[25:05] just to make sure that his
[25:07] opinion agreed with mine on that and
[25:09] he's a licensed attorney and
[25:10] respected in that field and and this is
[25:13] where he put it he said religious
[25:14] worship activities are exempt from the
[25:16] face covering mandate
[25:18] face mask would be required outside the
[25:20] building in a social setting
[25:22] unless social distancing is maintained
[25:24] now again if you can stay six feet away
[25:26] from everybody
[25:28] then you wouldn't have to that's the way
[25:30] the law reads you wouldn't have to wear
[25:31] a mask anywhere if you stay
[25:33] six feet away from everybody then that's
[25:34] hard to do so
[25:37] um but he says that face mask would be
[25:40] required outside the building in a
[25:41] social
[25:42] setting unless social distancing is
[25:43] maintained if you're considering doing
[25:45] religious worship activities outside
[25:47] then the face covering is not mandatory
[25:49] so if we were baptizing someone out here
[25:51] or having an outdoor service while we
[25:54] were doing that we wouldn't have to wear
[25:55] it
[25:56] but then when if you stood around and
[25:57] talked to one another then the
[25:59] religious activity is over and you'd
[26:02] have to
[26:03] you'd be subject to that and and once
[26:05] again that's the law just like a
[26:06] seatbelt law
[26:08] and i don't have to agree with it for it
[26:10] to be the law
[26:11] so uh we it's hard but it's just
[26:13] something that's necessary
[26:15] so what we're going to ask you to do is
[26:16] that is to voluntarily comply we're not
[26:18] going to force this on anyone but
[26:20] if you're 10 years of age or older
[26:22] because people under 10 are exempt thank
[26:24] goodness
[26:26] but if you're 10 years of age or older
[26:28] we're going to ask you to wear a face
[26:29] covering or a mask or maintain a
[26:31] distance of at least six feet
[26:33] from people outside your immediate
[26:34] family while you're on the church
[26:36] grounds you don't have to do that in
[26:37] here
[26:38] but while you're on the grounds once
[26:40] you're seated you can take off the mask
[26:43] that's where the exemption applies while
[26:45] we're having church you don't have to do
[26:47] that and
[26:47] the way you are this morning the way
[26:48] you're seated you're mostly within
[26:51] all of you are spread out in such a nice
[26:52] way and there's some folks that weren't
[26:54] able to come this morning because of
[26:55] sickness
[26:56] and that's something else we've asked
[26:57] you to do if you're sick stay home
[26:59] and that's not normally something we
[27:01] would say because we believe this is a
[27:02] place where you get healing
[27:05] but in this situation we don't want to
[27:07] spread these things around and we want
[27:09] to be responsible and so they've asked
[27:11] us if you're sick
[27:12] with a cold or flu-like symptoms then
[27:14] stay home
[27:15] and uh wait until your symptoms are over
[27:17] before coming back to church and
[27:19] and then that frees everyone else up
[27:21] because there's people that if they saw
[27:22] you and maybe you happen to cough or
[27:24] sneeze in their presence
[27:25] then they're shut in for 14 days and i
[27:28] know what that's like
[27:29] personally and many of you do as well so
[27:31] maybe they can't go to work and so it
[27:33] impacts other people
[27:34] so continue and the rest of the things
[27:37] that we have on there is just things
[27:38] we've already been doing
[27:40] we're not passing an offering plate
[27:41] we're trying to avoid shaking hands or
[27:43] embracing if you're not
[27:44] somebody in your family again this isn't
[27:47] a law
[27:48] this is not something that i'm telling
[27:49] you you have to do this is something i'm
[27:51] asking you to do
[27:52] as your pastor and and because it does
[27:54] affect us and it affects other people
[27:57] and it affects our testimony in the
[27:58] community so please please follow the
[28:00] guidelines if you can and and
[28:02] if you have a sickness or some valid
[28:04] medical reason why you can't wear a mask
[28:06] then obviously you're exempt from that
[28:11] when the service is through the only
[28:12] other thing that that i would ask you to
[28:14] do
[28:14] is that when the service is through
[28:16] let's not try not to congregate in the
[28:18] foyer
[28:18] there's not enough room back there and
[28:21] so we'd ask you especially on a
[28:22] beautiful day like today to just go on
[28:24] out the door
[28:25] and then you can fellowship outside um
[28:28] as much as you want to but there's just
[28:29] not enough
[28:30] room in the foyer to abide by the
[28:32] restrictions that we've been asked to
[28:33] abide by
[28:34] the way the law is written if a
[28:36] community or a county doesn't have
[28:40] doesn't have any cases for 28 days then
[28:43] they're exempt
[28:44] so i want you to pray with me we're an
[28:47] isolated county and i know we've had a
[28:49] case in the last 28 days because
[28:51] i was it but
[28:55] there's um there's a
[28:59] uh there's a possibility that we could
[29:01] be exempt from this and not too long
[29:03] and given that and and we are isolated
[29:05] from most the rest of the state so
[29:07] you be praying with me that god will
[29:08] just allow this to be where
[29:10] we've been protected compared to other
[29:12] churches we've been blessed to be able
[29:14] to have church the way we have and
[29:16] there's churches that are still
[29:17] streaming today and have been since
[29:18] february
[29:20] i know churches overseas that are still
[29:22] locked down
[29:23] and many of them and so there's just
[29:26] it's indefinite they may keep it going
[29:28] forever
[29:29] and thank god that we're able to meet
[29:30] together i believe it's a biblical
[29:32] mandate that we're able to meet together
[29:34] um we're also making an exception for
[29:36] laying hands on the sick i believe
[29:38] that's a biblical you have a right to
[29:41] have hands laid on you if you're sick if
[29:43] you're in need
[29:44] and we will do that for you and so
[29:47] you're welcome to come up here we'll lay
[29:49] hands on you we'll pray for you
[29:50] um if you feel comfortable doing that
[29:52] you're welcome to do that because that's
[29:53] a biblical order
[29:54] we're going to have communion this
[29:55] afternoon we're not doing the foot
[29:57] washing because there's just no way to
[29:58] do that
[29:59] and that that you know it bothers me but
[30:02] there's just no way that we could do it
[30:03] but we're going to do what we can do
[30:05] and uh and so we're going to do
[30:06] communion and we're going to put the
[30:08] uh the bread and the wine in separate
[30:10] cups so that you're not touching all of
[30:12] the bread and you'll be able to take it
[30:13] and you'll be able to come up
[30:14] we'll have someone bring you up uh by
[30:17] family group so
[30:18] that you're able to do that and uh but
[30:20] daniel be in charge of that and he'll
[30:21] need some help this afternoon so
[30:23] we appreciate all of you i know brother
[30:25] mark wanted to be here today and
[30:26] they had a little sniffles and things
[30:28] and they didn't want to spread it and
[30:29] brother allen and his family and
[30:31] and brother bill and sharon white kemp
[30:33] are also watching today
[30:35] because of that and so you'll be praying
[30:38] for them as well we know that our god is
[30:40] a mighty god
[30:41] and he's able to take care of all of
[30:43] these situations he's the master of the
[30:45] wind as
[30:46] both of the specials so eloquently they
[30:48] were singing i felt the presence of the
[30:50] lord that's our situation that we're in
[30:52] but we know he's master of it and
[30:54] there's a reason for it and so we
[30:56] we just ask you to comply with these
[30:57] things if you didn't understand all that
[30:59] i
[30:59] told you as i tried to hurry to go over
[31:02] it it's
[31:02] it's in the back and i also have a copy
[31:05] of the governor's mandate

[31:47] and but you guys have been great about
[31:49] doing those things with harvey moe in

[32:08] someone in the bride it's a great thing
[32:10] people don't realize what a wonderful
[32:12] thing that is
[32:13] your friendship and the way you treat
[32:14] people and they treat you can impact
[32:16] where they go
[32:17] and if they make it on that day you can
[32:19] stand for them on that day at the
[32:20] judgment and
[32:21] i'm so grateful for that we have a
[32:23] merciful god

[32:50] to do the best that we can we'll make
[32:52] many mistakes lord but
[32:53] we know that you are still in control
[32:56] and you're able to overcome
[32:58] all of our mistakes father and help us

[33:03] our world that we live in

[33:08] that you just speak to each and every
[33:10] one of our hearts

[33:25] lord in every situation i know that you
[33:27] can do it i know that you will in your
[33:29] time

[33:32] we have lord as we sit together
[33:34] may not be lord something that we just
[33:36] take for granted
[33:38] god the ability to worship you and to
[33:40] preach and to listen
[33:41] and to sing and to raise our hands and
[33:44] say man
[33:45] lord we have the freedom to do that
[33:47] let's do it with all of our heart this
[33:48] morning and
[33:49] we'll give you the praise and the glory
[33:51] and the honor for all you do
[33:52] in jesus name amen amen god bless you
[33:56] you could be seated
[33:57] this morning
[34:01] keep in mind the fellowship hall will be
[34:03] opened between services today if you
[34:05] need to stay
[34:06] so we'll do that i'm thankful this mask
[34:08] mandate didn't take effect until after
[34:10] we did this so
[34:12] the lord was with us there
[34:15] i'm going to read from exodus chapter 12
[34:17] and i'm going to ask you to stand again
[34:21] i see joel smirking every time that i do
[34:23] this
[34:27] as i said i don't like doing the
[34:29] announcements but it's something we have
[34:30] to do
[34:32] somebody's got to do it exodus chapter
[34:34] 12 and verse
[34:35] 13. i want to title this this morning
[34:39] the houses where you are
[34:41] the houses where you are and i trust
[34:44] it's a blessing to you
[34:45] exodus 12 13 of the blood shall be to
[34:47] you for a token
[34:50] upon the houses where you are
[34:53] now think about that upon the houses
[34:55] where you are
[34:56] when i see the blood i will pass over
[34:58] you
[34:59] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[35:01] destroy you
[35:03] when i smite the land of egypt i pray
[35:06] the lord would add his blessing to the
[35:07] word once again you may be seated
[35:16] all of us have at least three homes
[35:20] just batting a thousand this morning
[35:24] all of us have at least three homes on
[35:27] this planet
[35:28] we have our bodies are a house or a
[35:30] temple of god
[35:32] so this is a house we have our homes
[35:35] which is the place where we live and the
[35:37] people that we
[35:38] live with and the people that we that we
[35:40] fellowship with
[35:42] and then we have a church home as a part
[35:46] of the worldwide body of christ
[35:48] those are homes houses where we live
[35:52] where we live and i would tell you this
[35:55] morning that there's really no such
[35:56] thing as a homeless christian
[35:58] there's really no such thing as a
[36:01] homeless christian you say well they
[36:02] don't have a house but
[36:03] they may be so poor that they can't
[36:05] afford a roof over their head
[36:07] but they still have a home and paul even
[36:09] tells us that when this earthly
[36:11] tabernacle
[36:12] or house or dwelling is dissolved
[36:15] he said there's another one already
[36:17] waiting
[36:19] thank god for a home brother jt we've
[36:21] got a home
[36:22] and so but here on on this earth we have
[36:25] these homes this is where we live we
[36:28] live in this body
[36:29] we live in our homes with our families
[36:32] and we live
[36:33] in the church home so
[36:36] during these last few months we've been
[36:39] tested
[36:40] in this because there's been times we've
[36:42] not been able to be here
[36:44] we've not been able to be in a home in
[36:46] our church home
[36:48] and there's been times when some even
[36:50] today are not able to be here and and be
[36:52] around and that's
[36:53] important to be together the bible tells
[36:55] us to do that
[36:57] but due to the circumstances there's
[36:59] been times we've not been able to do
[37:01] that and
[37:02] there's been times when we've not even
[37:05] been able to be with anyone
[37:07] even in our homes even our families and
[37:10] some of you
[37:11] know what it's like to be alone to be by
[37:15] yourself
[37:16] and if you're by yourself for very long
[37:18] it's hard
[37:20] because human beings were made to be
[37:22] social made to interact and so
[37:25] you know what it's like to be alone but
[37:26] you know i think god allows that to
[37:28] happen
[37:30] and sometimes i think that this has
[37:32] happened for a reason and i'll
[37:34] get to that in a moment but this
[37:36] pandemic has shifted us away from doing
[37:38] a lot of the things that we enjoy doing
[37:40] in our homes
[37:41] or with our families or with the church
[37:46] and it's taking it where we can't have
[37:47] as many suppers as we used to and we
[37:49] can't
[37:50] do as many things just little things
[37:53] that we like to do to fellowship
[37:54] together sit down at a restaurant and
[37:55] eat together and
[37:56] and do the things that we love to do and
[37:58] it's made it where it's hard
[38:00] to be in that church setting we don't we
[38:03] look at
[38:03] youth camps that have been canceled for
[38:05] the first time in in my memory we look
[38:07] at
[38:08] sunday schools that have been closed we
[38:11] look at
[38:12] youth meetings and dinners and banquets
[38:15] that have been
[38:16] postponed and things that we would
[38:17] normally have and do
[38:19] and not able to do it there's been no
[38:21] end of frustrating for me
[38:23] because every time i schedule a preacher
[38:25] to try to come in and be a blessing to
[38:27] you
[38:27] something happens either he's not able
[38:29] to come because of this or i'm not able
[38:31] to to have
[38:32] him in and so it's created a real
[38:34] problem
[38:35] and a real distraction in our lives but
[38:39] there has to be a reason for it now if
[38:42] you go back in the bible and you look at
[38:43] israel and the way that they were tested
[38:45] and how they were tried
[38:46] every time there was a plague or every
[38:48] time there was a test on them
[38:50] it was for a reason right it was always
[38:54] for a reason god always showed him what
[38:55] what the reason was there was something
[38:57] that happened or there was some reason
[38:59] for it now for the world there wasn't
[39:02] the egyptians had those plagues there
[39:04] was no reason it seemed like
[39:06] for that to happen but when it when it
[39:08] come to the israelites there was a
[39:09] purpose
[39:11] there was a purpose for it god did that
[39:14] and as a bride we're still here
[39:17] on the earth and the fact that we're
[39:19] still here means that god would not
[39:20] allow
[39:21] something like this to happen unless
[39:24] there was a purpose for that to happen
[39:27] right and so it might happen all over
[39:29] the world in all kinds of places but for
[39:31] us who are the bride
[39:33] for this to happen there must be a
[39:35] purpose for us
[39:36] even though it affects everybody but
[39:39] it's a purpose for us
[39:40] and i wonder sometimes if it's not that
[39:42] god wants to strip us down
[39:45] until we get back to that first house
[39:47] which is this body
[39:49] and we begin to recognize we have to be
[39:51] christians here first
[39:55] right and so when you take away all the
[39:57] meetings and you take away all the
[39:58] enjoyment and all the fellowship and
[40:00] everything else
[40:01] and you get down to just this am i still
[40:04] a christian
[40:07] do i still serve god and some of you
[40:09] know what that's like maybe you've been
[40:10] sick or
[40:11] you you end up in hospital room for
[40:13] weeks and months and you're by yourself
[40:15] you know what that's like you get
[40:16] stripped down to am i a christian now
[40:22] not just when i can preach but am i a
[40:24] christian today
[40:27] a few years ago when i turned 30
[40:31] i felt like i was getting old then but
[40:34] when i turned 30 it seemed like my body
[40:37] started reacting differently and
[40:39] i have stomach problems and and i'm the
[40:42] type of person that
[40:43] loves to eat and i eat whatever i can
[40:45] get my hands on and that become a real
[40:47] problem
[40:48] and and i've got a stomach that just
[40:50] doesn't agree with that and i ended up
[40:51] in the hospital twice
[40:54] because i just ate the wrong thing and
[40:57] and i just don't agree with that and and
[40:58] it happened to me the first time i'd
[41:00] never been in a hospital before i'd only
[41:01] been in a doctor's office once in my
[41:03] life
[41:04] that i can remember and so when i turned
[41:07] 30 i ended up in the hospital
[41:09] and i'm there by myself and i'll never
[41:10] i'll never forget what i
[41:12] forget what that was like because both
[41:14] times that it happened it happened on a
[41:16] on a wednesday when i was supposed to
[41:19] preach
[41:21] both times and it's the first two times
[41:23] in my ministry that i've been preaching
[41:25] since i was 12 years old
[41:26] first time i'd ever had to not preach
[41:29] because i was sick
[41:31] and so i got end up in the hospital i'm
[41:33] there by myself and i thought lord what
[41:35] what is the purpose of all of this
[41:38] and i remember my wife went to i don't
[41:40] know why i'm telling you this this
[41:42] morning but maybe there's a there's a
[41:43] reason but
[41:44] we i ended up in the hospital in
[41:47] jonesboro and saint bernard's and
[41:49] that at one occasion and almost that's
[41:51] an occasion that
[41:54] due to my stubbornness i almost died
[41:56] from not going in and
[41:57] and so i went in and i got rid of the
[41:59] infection of things that i had and i
[42:00] went
[42:01] as i'm sitting there laying there in the
[42:02] hospital thinking what was me
[42:06] what what would be the purpose of this
[42:07] my wife is driving my truck which was a
[42:10] nice truck at the time and
[42:11] she was driving home she left because i
[42:13] didn't want her to keep the kids she
[42:14] couldn't keep the kids up there and
[42:16] we didn't want to ask anybody to keep
[42:17] them so she left went back home
[42:19] she's driving out of jonesboro and the
[42:21] alternator went out on the truck
[42:24] and just stopped dead on the side of a
[42:26] four-lane highway and she just stopped
[42:28] there in the dark with nothing
[42:29] you know in jonesborough and and uh
[42:32] there's a lady that come by her way
[42:35] that just stopped and saw her she
[42:37] actually was walking with all three kids
[42:39] to a gas station
[42:41] because her phone had also went dead
[42:44] so she's walking in the dark along the
[42:46] side of a four-lane highway to
[42:48] a gas station that she could see but it
[42:49] was a ways down there and
[42:51] and this lady stops from jonesboro just
[42:55] just a lady there from that area and she
[42:58] happened to be the wife of a missionary
[43:00] of a preacher and she stopped there and
[43:02] and they got to talking their friends to
[43:04] this day because
[43:06] and it made an impact on her life and
[43:08] and she's watched our family and things
[43:10] like that and watch some of our services
[43:12] and i
[43:12] and i think back at that like i said you
[43:14] don't know what it means to be a friend
[43:18] what if god decided he was going to give
[43:20] eternal life to somebody
[43:22] who maybe would never even be in the
[43:23] message never be around but there'd be
[43:25] eternal life to somebody
[43:27] and he put me in a hospital room so and
[43:30] my wife on the side of the road
[43:32] so so they could meet
[43:35] he said god wouldn't do that we don't
[43:37] know
[43:39] god moves in mysterious ways his wonders
[43:43] to perform
[43:44] and so these things happen for a reason
[43:46] and i think that we've got to get down
[43:48] to the point where we realize
[43:49] and they're in the hospital room i begin
[43:51] to realize how helpless that i really
[43:53] was
[43:54] and we begin to realize we really are
[43:56] helpless we're dependent on
[43:57] on god to help us and keep us healthy
[43:59] and all the things that were dependent
[44:01] on him to heal us we have nothing
[44:03] without him
[44:05] and so every time we experience the test
[44:08] god is doing something in our lives
[44:12] i want us to to look at this because
[44:16] when we get past the singing and the
[44:18] worship and the preaching and
[44:20] we get past the fellowship when you go
[44:23] home today you've got to be a christian
[44:26] and i've got to be a christian
[44:29] and so these houses if you look at it
[44:31] like this that there's the house of your
[44:32] body
[44:33] there's a house the home that you live
[44:35] in there's the house of god
[44:37] and as you begin to look at these things
[44:39] you realize that if you're not a
[44:40] christian here
[44:41] in your body you won't apply the token
[44:44] to your home
[44:46] right so it's impossible to just be a
[44:49] christian here in your home
[44:51] and not be a christian here
[44:54] and it's impossible to you may act like
[44:56] a christian look like a christian but if
[44:57] you're not
[44:58] if you're not a christian here in your
[45:00] body you won't be a christian
[45:02] at church even though you might
[45:04] assimilate with all the other christians
[45:07] and so first corinthians 6 and 19 speaks
[45:10] about this first house our bodies it
[45:12] says what
[45:13] knowing not that your body is the temple
[45:15] of the holy ghost
[45:17] which is in you which you have of god
[45:18] and you are not your own
[45:21] you're not your own you don't we we look
[45:23] at the rights that we have we have
[45:24] certain rights over our bodies
[45:27] and even the the people the abortionists
[45:29] today would say
[45:30] it's my right to kill my baby
[45:33] what a what a convoluted idea it's my
[45:35] right
[45:37] but but see our body as christians is
[45:39] not our own
[45:41] it doesn't belong to us it was redeemed
[45:43] was bought with a
[45:45] he said your body is the temple of the
[45:47] holy ghost
[45:49] which you have of god and you're not
[45:51] your own for your bought with the price
[45:52] therefore
[45:53] glorify god in your body and in your
[45:56] spirit
[45:56] which are god's
[46:00] glorify god in your body and in your
[46:02] spirit
[46:03] which are gods and what that means is
[46:07] that there's more responsibility than
[46:09] just as an individual agreeing that the
[46:11] message is true
[46:12] or that the word you hear preach here is
[46:14] true
[46:15] but it's more than that all that does is
[46:17] make you a hypocrite if you don't live
[46:18] it it's more than just agreeing that
[46:22] it's true
[46:23] but in the old testament the individual
[46:25] worshiper had to be identified with the
[46:27] lamb
[46:28] so it just comes down to the individual
[46:30] and the lamb
[46:32] and that's what i think maybe if you
[46:34] could look at it that way and i'm not
[46:35] trying to be spiritual or anything but
[46:37] just look at it like that that
[46:38] during this time we begin to realize
[46:40] that it's just the blood
[46:42] between us and the death angel that's
[46:45] all that staff stood between israel but
[46:48] the caleb and the death agent was the
[46:49] blood
[46:51] and it's all that stands this morning
[46:52] between you and the death angel it's the
[46:54] blood
[46:57] and that's what it got down to the
[46:59] church they couldn't congregate together
[47:01] and have a feast day or have a big
[47:02] meeting but they had to come in the
[47:04] houses where they were
[47:05] and in those houses they had to learn to
[47:07] be christians
[47:11] they had to be under the blood they had
[47:13] to apply
[47:15] the token so
[47:18] you had to be identified with the lamb
[47:19] and so the lamb he would take his lamb
[47:21] and he would take it up to the
[47:23] to be sacrificed and he lay his hand on
[47:25] the head of the lamb
[47:27] and feel the blood leaving its body
[47:31] he had to feel blood leaving his body
[47:34] brother branham type that to us so we
[47:36] have to
[47:36] to feel the suffering of christ
[47:40] we have to be so invested so identified
[47:43] with it that we feel it
[47:45] so it makes sense that that we we know
[47:48] it's more than just a
[47:49] an idea that he died but we know that he
[47:52] died for us
[47:54] it does something to us we get the blood
[47:55] all over us
[47:57] and yet in that time the blood cell
[48:00] could not come back on them
[48:01] the life that was in an animal couldn't
[48:03] come back on them because it was an
[48:05] animal life
[48:06] but now we have the life of christ and
[48:09] brother branham deals with this
[48:10] in the token on the one that he preached
[48:12] in february of 1964 he said that's what
[48:14] he was requiring that night
[48:16] to separate the believers from the
[48:18] unbelievers the believer worshiper was
[48:21] identified with the sacrifice he must
[48:23] apply the blood
[48:24] it wasn't take and kill the lamb set the
[48:27] blood out there somewhere keep it in the
[48:28] charger take it down to the neighbors
[48:31] he had to apply the blood
[48:34] he had to apply the blood i wonder if
[48:36] god's not showing us that we have to
[48:37] apply the blood
[48:40] at home that if we become dependent on a
[48:42] man somewhere or church somewhere or
[48:43] somebody else somewhere
[48:45] to be the blood for us to be our our
[48:47] savior but no
[48:48] we have to apply the blood in the houses
[48:52] where we are
[48:54] and so brother brown says he had to
[48:56] apply the blood he said that's the way
[48:57] it is tonight
[48:58] we could come and sympathize with
[49:00] everything god does
[49:03] that isn't what god requires you've got
[49:06] to apply it you believe that this
[49:08] morning
[49:09] you've got to apply it it's not
[49:11] sufficient until you apply it
[49:15] the blood must be applied to be just
[49:17] like we talk about that seat belt ticket
[49:18] you can sit out there and drive down the
[49:20] road and the policemen stop you and
[49:22] you're not wearing your seatbelt and you
[49:23] can say well why aren't you wearing your
[49:25] seatbelt you say well i agree with the
[49:26] law
[49:27] i completely agree with that i believe
[49:29] the seat belt law is a good law
[49:31] i believe you should wear one i believe
[49:34] everybody should wear a seat belt
[49:36] but if you don't have one on you're
[49:37] going to get a ticket
[49:41] i remember when i was younger somebody
[49:42] told me you got to be careful what
[49:44] people tell you but
[49:45] somebody told me that if you if a cop
[49:48] pulled up and saw you putting your
[49:50] seatbelt on
[49:51] that they would give you a ticket but if
[49:53] you were honest about it just left it
[49:55] off they wouldn't
[49:57] i don't know who told me that but it
[49:58] wasn't right
[50:02] because i got pulled over with my
[50:03] brother and i'm sitting in the passenger
[50:04] seat and
[50:05] walk up there's here in arkansas
[50:07] somewhere and we walked up there and
[50:09] and he looked at me and my brother snuck
[50:10] his on and i'm sitting there with no
[50:12] seatbelt on he said
[50:14] why aren't you wearing your seatbelt
[50:16] said is there a reason why you didn't
[50:17] put it on after i stopped you
[50:21] well i got the ticket i mean
[50:26] but see you have to put it on you have
[50:28] to actually be identified with it
[50:30] you have to actually do it or it doesn't
[50:33] do you any good
[50:34] and so we could come and sit sympathize
[50:37] with everything god does that isn't what
[50:38] he requires you've got to apply
[50:40] it it's not sufficient until you apply
[50:41] it the blood must be applied
[50:43] that shows that you are identified the
[50:45] worshiper laid his hand upon the lamb
[50:46] and then killed it identify himself with
[50:48] the sacrifice
[50:49] he said the same thing we do tonight
[50:51] let's lay our hand upon our sacrifice
[50:53] and identify ourselves with him he said
[50:56] and he is the word
[50:58] we have to be identified only through
[51:01] christ
[51:02] is when we're identified by the word
[51:05] because he is the word always has
[51:09] been now i want to kind of
[51:13] dig a little deep plow a little deep
[51:14] because i think that we need to
[51:16] understand this
[51:18] being able to feel the presence of god
[51:20] in a church service it's not a
[51:22] substitute for being born again
[51:27] not a substitute for being born again
[51:30] you may feel it and it's wonderful and i
[51:33] a man but the man said the beliefs god
[51:35] can feel god and know it feel his
[51:36] presence know that he's there
[51:38] i believe in that but it's not a
[51:40] substitute for being born again
[51:42] because being born again has nothing to
[51:44] do with how you feel
[51:47] and so brother branham taught us in 1957
[51:50] on the door of the door
[51:51] for several years there brother branham
[51:53] cowed down on this because pentecost had
[51:54] gone into emotionalism
[51:56] only and tongues being the evidence of
[51:59] the holy ghost
[52:00] and brother branham just fought that
[52:01] everywhere he went he preached at it
[52:04] and he said you accept him as some sign
[52:06] or some wonder or some emotion or some
[52:08] evidence
[52:09] he said the evidence that christ is in
[52:10] the heart bears the fruit of the spirit
[52:12] faith love joy
[52:13] peace long suffering gentleness patience
[52:15] it's the fruit of the spirit and he
[52:16] later on clarifies how that we know
[52:19] because we can say amen to every word
[52:22] right and so but he said that's the
[52:23] fruit of the spirit he said but we have
[52:25] confused it with other things
[52:27] divine healing gift speaking with
[52:30] tongues oil in the hand blood in the
[52:31] face
[52:33] some little sensation we've confused the
[52:36] real spirit of god with that
[52:38] and accepted something bogus instead of
[52:40] the person
[52:41] christ in the heart he said you see what
[52:45] a condition the church the full gospel
[52:47] church has got into
[52:48] it's the laodicean age to bring to pass
[52:51] the very word that our blessed savior
[52:53] spoke there in the bible
[52:55] lukewarm danced by the music shout and
[52:57] clap hands he said oh them things are
[52:59] all right but if christ
[53:00] isn't there when the hand clapping's
[53:01] over when the speaking with tongues are
[53:03] over
[53:03] and the healing service is over when the
[53:05] music stops
[53:08] we've been through a time like that when
[53:11] all this is over when the music stops he
[53:13] said it's that deep
[53:14] settled peace them doors of faith
[53:16] standing wide open
[53:18] to let him be lord over the situation
[53:21] not unless you shout in church and dance
[53:23] in church but whether he's lord
[53:25] over the coronavirus whether he's lord
[53:27] over cancer whether he's lord over
[53:29] diabetes whether he's lord over sin
[53:33] that's the door of faith being wide open
[53:35] to allow him to be lord over the
[53:37] situation
[53:37] it doesn't do us any good to play the
[53:39] music or clap our hands or speak in
[53:41] tongues or have a healing service
[53:43] he said we led him so far but now lord
[53:45] he said he said you stay back there you
[53:47] might have done that to brother
[53:48] so-and-so
[53:48] sister so-and-so to their child but my
[53:50] case is different
[53:52] he said it isn't different you're the
[53:54] one that's making the difference
[53:56] by keeping him out of your faith door he
[53:58] said you see what i mean he wants inside
[54:00] there
[54:01] do we believe that this morning he said
[54:04] he wants inside there so he just pushed
[54:05] to open the door
[54:07] and expose all your unbelief
[54:10] that's the very reason why we don't want
[54:11] him in there isn't it
[54:14] but he wants inside he wants inside how
[54:16] can he come inside we have to invite him
[54:18] in
[54:20] we have to open that door he said you
[54:22] just push open the door and expose all
[54:24] your unbelief and become lord of the
[54:25] situation
[54:27] that's what we need that's what we need
[54:30] a lot of churches that have music and i
[54:32] love music and a lot of churches that
[54:34] have
[54:34] preaching i love good preaching but what
[54:36] we need is him to become lord of the
[54:38] situation
[54:42] see life brings emotion it always does
[54:44] anything without emotion is dead
[54:46] but life is not emotion it brings
[54:49] emotion
[54:51] brother randall says i think our
[54:52] pentecostal days have become a stink
[54:54] and he's referring to in the old
[54:57] testament when he said the sacrifices
[54:58] and offerings become a stench to god
[55:00] a stink in his nostrils and he said i
[55:04] think our pentecostal days have become a
[55:05] stink we play the music and jump up and
[55:07] down the aisles and dance and
[55:08] run up and down we don't have much of a
[55:10] problem with that in our church but
[55:12] but i i and i you know i would be all
[55:14] for that i
[55:15] am for that but that's not life
[55:19] right he says and and women with cut
[55:22] hair and lipstick on their faces and
[55:23] things like that and run around here
[55:25] dancing in the spirit
[55:26] with a dress on it's tight enough to put
[55:27] the skin on the outside
[55:29] and we expect god to meet us in such a
[55:31] system as that
[55:32] never will he do it he said you know god
[55:35] don't come to your terms
[55:37] you come to his terms where you don't
[55:39] come at all
[55:43] you see this house this house for the
[55:46] fam this house
[55:47] but david is it's got to i'm trying to
[55:49] stay away from you here
[55:50] this house has got to have the token
[55:53] applied
[55:54] because if it doesn't it'll revert to
[55:56] its natural state
[55:58] and that's the state that paul talks
[55:59] about oh wretched man that i am who
[56:02] shall deliver me from the body of this
[56:04] death this
[56:04] this cankering body that is dying that
[56:07] that is decaying that is sinful who
[56:10] shall deliver me amen
[56:12] and if that if he is not lord of the
[56:14] situation if he is not
[56:16] open in every part of our heart in our
[56:17] life if that token is not applied to our
[56:20] life to this house
[56:22] we revert to our natural state of being
[56:25] a sinner
[56:28] brother brown says god never did deal
[56:30] never did in any time take any group of
[56:32] people to do anything
[56:34] god takes an individual you're the one
[56:37] you one person
[56:40] god never changes this program because
[56:42] his first program he must always remain
[56:45] with that program
[56:47] the days of noah he had one man noah the
[56:50] day said he brought israel out he had
[56:51] one man that was moses
[56:53] we know of dates and many of the others
[56:54] tried to think well they had the same
[56:56] authority and so forth
[56:57] you know what happened to them the days
[56:58] of the coming of the lord the days of
[57:00] john the baptist the different ones
[57:02] he has one individual he works with
[57:03] listen he had one prophet for this age
[57:06] no other man has the same authority
[57:10] no pastor no other prophet no other
[57:12] person no matter who he is
[57:14] has the same authority as that one that
[57:16] god called that individual
[57:18] he said he has one individual he works
[57:20] with and he deals with us today as one
[57:22] individual not as a group
[57:23] one person it's going to be up to you
[57:26] and i
[57:27] of how we stand before god
[57:30] because he's dealing with you and i as
[57:32] individuals
[57:34] not as a group that we're in not as the
[57:36] denomination church we belong to
[57:38] but as you and i as individuals
[57:41] later on in that sermon he said now when
[57:43] israel come over the river of jordan
[57:45] he said now try to catch this when
[57:46] israel crossed over into the land
[57:48] the promised land there was a gentile
[57:49] woman we know as rahab the harlot
[57:52] and she asked for mercy and she received
[57:54] mercy
[57:55] she received mercy as long as she stayed
[57:57] under the scarlet cord
[57:59] he said and that's the only way she
[58:00] could have mercy it was a sign a token
[58:02] that was given her
[58:03] we have a token today also and we're
[58:06] safe
[58:07] as long as we stay under our scarlet
[58:09] core the blood of jesus christ
[58:12] as an individual not a group
[58:16] an individual we each must stay under
[58:19] that scarlet cord of the blood of jesus
[58:21] christ
[58:23] you go back and read it and we'll talk
[58:25] about the house here in a moment that
[58:26] includes rehab as well
[58:28] as an individual rahab had to apply the
[58:31] token for the saving of her household
[58:34] so this house had to apply the token for
[58:36] this house
[58:38] are you with me now this house had to
[58:40] display the token for
[58:42] this house had to display the token for
[58:43] this house so it was a sign
[58:46] a token that was given her that it would
[58:48] not be an individual not a group but she
[58:49] had to do
[58:50] it and even the people told her we'll
[58:52] look at it in a moment
[58:53] they said if anyone goes out or comes in
[58:55] or whatever
[58:56] he said if they go out from under it
[58:58] you're not responsible and we're not
[59:00] responsible
[59:01] but if they stay under the blood so each
[59:05] individual is responsible in that way
[59:06] now
[59:08] so that's our first house it's this
[59:09] house
[59:11] this house is not taken care of you're
[59:13] never i don't care how well you can
[59:14] preach how well you can sing how well
[59:16] you can testify
[59:18] how much you say you believe the message
[59:20] if you don't let him be lord of the
[59:22] situation in this house
[59:24] you're never going he's never going to
[59:26] be lord in these other two houses
[59:29] you're going to have problems at home
[59:30] you're going to have problems in the
[59:31] church
[59:32] you say well that's for if you're a
[59:34] preacher or singer no it's for every one
[59:36] of us
[59:39] now so once the individual is born again
[59:42] his whole house then
[59:44] i love this can be saved
[59:49] it's the house is where you are what's
[59:51] that that individual he had to apply the
[59:52] blood
[59:53] but then his house could be saved
[59:57] and cornelius when when peter
[1:00:00] was sent to cornelius and peter's
[1:00:01] telling the story in acts chapter 11
[1:00:03] verse 13 he showed us
[1:00:04] how he had seen an angel in his house
[1:00:06] which stood and said unto him send men
[1:00:08] to joplin call for simon whose surname
[1:00:10] is peter
[1:00:11] who shall tell thee words i love that
[1:00:15] who will tell you words whereby thou and
[1:00:17] all thy house should be saved
[1:00:21] he's going to tell you words he's going
[1:00:23] to tell you about how jesus died how
[1:00:25] how he rose again on the third day and
[1:00:27] by those words
[1:00:29] you're going to be saved
[1:00:32] as i begin to speak he said the holy
[1:00:34] ghost fell on them
[1:00:36] as on us at the beginning but notice
[1:00:38] what it said whereby thou and all thy
[1:00:40] house shall be saved and that word house
[1:00:43] is actually household it's not the
[1:00:46] building
[1:00:47] it's not just your your home that you
[1:00:49] live what we call a home but what we
[1:00:51] call
[1:00:52] our family today it would be a household
[1:00:54] back then and it would include everybody
[1:00:57] under
[1:00:58] your roof and in in in your domain so it
[1:01:00] could be a servant
[1:01:02] it could be your business everything
[1:01:04] that belonged to you
[1:01:06] right was in your household now
[1:01:10] some have smaller households than others
[1:01:11] but you have something that's a home to
[1:01:13] you
[1:01:14] we find this in the philippian jailer as
[1:01:16] well in acts 16 29
[1:01:19] says he called for a light and sprang in
[1:01:21] and came trembling and fell down before
[1:01:23] paul and silas
[1:01:24] remember they had the earthquake and he
[1:01:26] thought all the prisoners were gone and
[1:01:27] paul hollered out and said hey we're
[1:01:28] still here
[1:01:31] you talk about faith paul had it i'd
[1:01:33] have been looking for that door you know
[1:01:35] to escape
[1:01:35] out of there paul you know you think
[1:01:38] about them other prisoners that didn't
[1:01:39] have
[1:01:40] you know weren't saved didn't know who
[1:01:41] paul was and they're ready to go and
[1:01:43] paul says wait a minute we're all still
[1:01:45] here
[1:01:48] but he he brought them out and and said
[1:01:51] sirs
[1:01:52] what must i do to be saved and they said
[1:01:55] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[1:01:57] thou shalt be saved
[1:01:58] in thy house
[1:02:02] why because an individual would believe
[1:02:06] bad look at the power of one individual
[1:02:09] that will believe
[1:02:10] he said your house will be saved they
[1:02:13] spake it in the word of the lord and to
[1:02:15] all
[1:02:15] that were in his house notice they went
[1:02:17] ahead and preached to those in his house
[1:02:19] they still had to hear the word but they
[1:02:21] said because of your faith they can be
[1:02:23] saved
[1:02:24] oh i'm holding on to that today i'm
[1:02:27] holding on to that
[1:02:28] they may leave for a while they may get
[1:02:30] crazy they may they may do all kinds of
[1:02:32] things but i'm holding on to the fact
[1:02:33] he said you and all your house can be
[1:02:35] saved
[1:02:38] and they speak unto him the word of the
[1:02:40] lord and to all that were in his house
[1:02:41] and he took the same hour of the night
[1:02:42] notice how quickly he acted
[1:02:44] he said i believe in the same hour of
[1:02:46] the night wash your stripes and was
[1:02:48] baptized he and all his
[1:02:49] straight way i love the way that says it
[1:02:52] he and all his he said everything in my
[1:02:54] house we're getting baptized
[1:02:56] today he and all his straight way
[1:03:00] and people today say well you can't tell
[1:03:01] your kids what to do
[1:03:03] well i kind of think he was a little bit
[1:03:07] urgent to his house
[1:03:09] you need to be baptized today
[1:03:13] get them on that same hour little urgent
[1:03:16] in his house you need to be baptized
[1:03:17] today i think we need
[1:03:19] as long as our kids are under our roof
[1:03:20] to to be firm
[1:03:22] in what we believe huh
[1:03:26] i excuse me i i'm comfortable this
[1:03:29] morning you forgive me for that
[1:03:30] sometimes you get too comfortable but
[1:03:32] you know you get to you look at
[1:03:33] things and i watch kids my kids go to
[1:03:36] school with or went to school with and
[1:03:38] you watch the way they dress and i think
[1:03:39] who bought the clothes
[1:03:42] why would any grown woman want her 12 or
[1:03:44] 13 or 11 year old daughter to dress like
[1:03:47] that
[1:03:48] why why and and you find out the kids
[1:03:51] run the house
[1:03:53] and if mom had had a problem with it she
[1:03:55] couldn't say anything
[1:03:57] because she has to ask permission
[1:04:01] well my daughter's learned that if she's
[1:04:03] going to wear something new and if it's
[1:04:04] going to be and she likes to look pretty
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:06] excuse me esther for using you this
[1:04:08] morning but she likes to look pretty and
[1:04:09] she'll
[1:04:10] you know she wants to wear something
[1:04:11] that's fashionable and all she knows
[1:04:13] she's going to have to show it to me
[1:04:15] because if not when i see it i'm going
[1:04:16] to say something
[1:04:18] i don't that ain't going to work you
[1:04:20] can't wear that to church
[1:04:22] can't wear that out in the public and
[1:04:24] she knows i'm going to so she
[1:04:26] got to where she'd come to me and and
[1:04:28] say what how do you like this
[1:04:29] you know because she knows i'm going to
[1:04:31] and her mama will as well
[1:04:33] but if her mama buys it then i have
[1:04:34] confidence that it's going to be all
[1:04:35] right
[1:04:37] because i know she wouldn't buy her
[1:04:38] clothes like that right
[1:04:40] but but again we're responsible for our
[1:04:42] house
[1:04:45] i'm responsible if my kids run around
[1:04:48] cussing and drinking and stuff while
[1:04:50] they're at home it'd be pretty hard to
[1:04:51] do right now but
[1:04:53] i'm responsible for that responsible for
[1:04:55] my house god help us
[1:04:57] you know i believe we serve a god that
[1:04:59] is has keeping power
[1:05:02] yes i believe he has saving power he can
[1:05:04] save someone who's been there
[1:05:05] and done the worst thing but i'm a
[1:05:07] testimony in my life
[1:05:09] that god has keeping power he's able to
[1:05:12] keep you
[1:05:13] out of those things away from those
[1:05:14] things and i'm so thankful for that
[1:05:17] and if you really kept then you you
[1:05:19] don't have an arrogant spirit about it
[1:05:21] but you
[1:05:22] you thank god for it every moment
[1:05:23] because you know what you could be
[1:05:26] and you know what you could have done
[1:05:28] but for grace
[1:05:30] you know how close you came to the
[1:05:32] steward to doing something that would
[1:05:34] have
[1:05:34] impacted your life completely right if
[1:05:37] you've been
[1:05:37] if you raised in a message maybe there
[1:05:38] was a time you could think back and look
[1:05:40] and see
[1:05:40] there was a time i almost made a
[1:05:42] decision to do something but thank god
[1:05:44] he protected me
[1:05:45] he was with me and then i i finally got
[1:05:47] to a point where i could make some
[1:05:48] decisions that were right and god began
[1:05:50] to influence my life and i was born
[1:05:52] again
[1:05:52] and then things began to go a certain
[1:05:54] direction but there was a time i could
[1:05:55] have went any either way
[1:05:57] but the hand of god was on me i believe
[1:05:59] in a god like that
[1:06:03] it's our house we're responsible for it
[1:06:04] rahab and joshua 2 18
[1:06:06] said behold when we come into the land
[1:06:08] thou shalt bind this line of scarlet
[1:06:10] thread in the window which thou just let
[1:06:11] us down by and thou shall bring thy
[1:06:13] father
[1:06:14] my mother my brethren and all thy
[1:06:16] father's household
[1:06:18] home unto thee because at that time in
[1:06:21] that time period she wouldn't have had
[1:06:23] a legal household that would have been
[1:06:24] her father's so he said even your
[1:06:26] father's household
[1:06:28] that belongs to you oh my
[1:06:32] and it shall be that whatsoever shall go
[1:06:33] out of the doors of the house into the
[1:06:35] street
[1:06:35] his blood shall be upon his head we will
[1:06:38] be guiltless
[1:06:39] whosoever shall be with thee in the
[1:06:41] house his blood should be on our head
[1:06:43] if any hand be upon him brother branham
[1:06:47] says
[1:06:48] in the token in in september of 1963 he
[1:06:50] said believe for safety
[1:06:52] he said then apply see believe he said
[1:06:55] here's what you want to believe for
[1:06:57] see you want your own safety you believe
[1:06:59] for your safety
[1:07:01] and then apply the token for the whole
[1:07:03] family
[1:07:05] i think that applies to the situation
[1:07:06] we're in now too
[1:07:08] you want safety you believe for safety
[1:07:11] and then you apply that for the whole
[1:07:12] family
[1:07:14] you say how can i do that claim it if it
[1:07:16] worked on you then you and the word
[1:07:18] becomes one
[1:07:20] very bad see it works for both of you
[1:07:24] he said you and the word are one then
[1:07:26] apply it to your children apply it to
[1:07:28] your loved ones like rahab did
[1:07:30] she applied the token to her father she
[1:07:31] applied it to her mother she applied it
[1:07:33] to her brothers and sisters and got them
[1:07:35] all in
[1:07:36] you apply it and then he's going to tell
[1:07:38] you how to do it he said say lord
[1:07:40] i'm going after my son i'm going after
[1:07:44] my daughter
[1:07:44] i claim her now you all know if you have
[1:07:47] grown children you can't
[1:07:48] literally go after them you try to drag
[1:07:51] them to church this morning but joe
[1:07:52] wouldn't go too well probably
[1:07:54] if you had to drag them but you know
[1:07:57] how do you go after them in prayer
[1:08:01] in faith you go after them
[1:08:05] and then what else can you do you can
[1:08:06] talk
[1:08:09] i told the folks back at the obvious a
[1:08:11] few years ago we were going through the
[1:08:13] token
[1:08:14] series and i spent about a year doing
[1:08:16] that and we went through all of that and
[1:08:17] i told him i said
[1:08:18] you know every one of us has to be able
[1:08:20] to talk
[1:08:22] especially if we're in a position of
[1:08:23] authority and i know it's harder for
[1:08:24] some people than for others
[1:08:25] someone who's just uncomfortable talking
[1:08:27] to our children but we have to be able
[1:08:28] to do that
[1:08:29] we have to be able to at least present
[1:08:31] the basic gospel to our children
[1:08:34] to at least be able to tell this is how
[1:08:35] you get saved
[1:08:37] and that's not it is something we preach
[1:08:39] across the pulpit but that's on its most
[1:08:41] basic level our responsibilities
[1:08:43] that's applying the token to our house
[1:08:46] this is how you get saved this is how
[1:08:48] this is what baptism is this is what it
[1:08:50] means this is what communion means when
[1:08:51] you should or shouldn't take it
[1:08:53] this is what these things mean you have
[1:08:55] to be able to
[1:08:56] you may not be the most eloquent speaker
[1:08:58] be able to explain it but you have to be
[1:08:59] able to at least talk to them or get
[1:09:01] them to someone who can talk to them
[1:09:04] right because if you can't talk to them
[1:09:06] about it then
[1:09:07] you it's hard to get them to understand
[1:09:10] because
[1:09:10] faith comes by hearing and many of them
[1:09:12] will never hear me preach
[1:09:14] but they'll hear you talk right and then
[1:09:17] you do it that in the right way
[1:09:19] and be a friend to him and all those
[1:09:20] things but he said you say i'm going
[1:09:22] after my daughter i claim her
[1:09:24] satan you turn her loose amen i'm coming
[1:09:27] after i apply my type
[1:09:28] my token the holy spirit oh holy spirit
[1:09:31] that lives within me
[1:09:32] catch my daughter there i'm going to her
[1:09:34] now with your anointing upon me
[1:09:38] amen we have to apply it to our house
[1:09:43] brother brown this is a well-known quote
[1:09:45] and you've heard it a million times but
[1:09:46] i want to put it here because it
[1:09:48] matters it still matters but the problem
[1:09:50] said what do you do when you apply it to
[1:09:51] your house you move all the trash out
[1:09:54] get all the short skirts and the shorts
[1:09:55] and the carts and cigarettes and the
[1:09:56] televisions whatever more kick them out
[1:09:58] the door
[1:09:59] when you go apply the token it won't
[1:10:00] stand still for it yes sir he said take
[1:10:03] it all out
[1:10:04] and over the years we've taken this
[1:10:05] quote i know and and taken televisions
[1:10:08] and then that be the one thing you have
[1:10:09] to kick out he said kick a bunch of
[1:10:10] other stuff out too
[1:10:13] it's anything that keeps you from god
[1:10:18] john wesley's mother gave her son the
[1:10:21] definition of sin
[1:10:22] and she said sin is anything that keeps
[1:10:24] you
[1:10:26] that steals your time or that keeps you
[1:10:29] from having a close relationship with
[1:10:31] god
[1:10:33] get rid of it if it's in between you and
[1:10:36] god get rid of it
[1:10:38] he said when you go apply the token it
[1:10:39] won't stand still for it yes sir take it
[1:10:41] all out the dances the parties
[1:10:42] rock and roll old vulgar newspapers the
[1:10:45] stuff that's of the world kick it out
[1:10:46] the door
[1:10:47] say we're cleaning out this place around
[1:10:49] here he said like jacob did he said
[1:10:51] told his wife and all them said wash
[1:10:53] your clothes and everything put away
[1:10:54] them gods
[1:10:56] he said you know what joshua said before
[1:10:57] crossing over he said wash your clothes
[1:10:59] come down at your wives and so forth to
[1:11:01] get ready
[1:11:01] for within three days we'll cross jordan
[1:11:03] listen church we're about to cross over
[1:11:06] it's getting close we're at the end time
[1:11:07] we're about to cross over let's get it
[1:11:10] out
[1:11:12] you say well i don't have a television i
[1:11:14] don't i don't have that but
[1:11:16] whatever it is jesus said if your eye
[1:11:18] offends you pluck it out he's making a
[1:11:19] point
[1:11:20] whatever it is take the extreme measure
[1:11:22] that you need to take to get rid of the
[1:11:23] thing
[1:11:25] that's keeping you from god if there's
[1:11:28] some room that you won't let god in
[1:11:30] because in that room is that thing
[1:11:33] that's keeping you from god or that idea
[1:11:35] or that complex or whatever that it is
[1:11:36] in that room and you keep that door shut
[1:11:38] you're gonna have to get rid of
[1:11:40] it before you cross over
[1:11:44] aren't you glad for the grace of god
[1:11:45] that gives us the token so we can get
[1:11:47] rid of it
[1:11:48] gives us the ability to open up we can
[1:11:50] never do that on our own
[1:11:51] but we can open up those doors and say
[1:11:53] here it is lord
[1:11:55] here it is joshua 24 14 says now
[1:11:58] therefore fear the lord
[1:12:00] serve him in sincerity and in truth put
[1:12:02] away the gods which your father served
[1:12:03] on the other side of the flood
[1:12:04] in egypt and served you the lord and if
[1:12:07] it seems evil unto you to serve the lord
[1:12:09] choose you this day whom you will serve
[1:12:13] what's the brother brandon talking about
[1:12:14] when he talks about kicking the stuff
[1:12:15] out your house
[1:12:16] this house now you've cleaned this house
[1:12:18] this house is right with god
[1:12:20] but it's time for this house to be right
[1:12:22] with god
[1:12:23] your household he says if it seems evil
[1:12:26] unto you to serve the lord choose this
[1:12:28] day whom you will serve
[1:12:29] whether the gods which your father
[1:12:30] served or on the other side of the flood
[1:12:32] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[1:12:33] land you dwell
[1:12:34] but as for me and my house we will serve
[1:12:38] the lord
[1:12:40] by the time we had somebody would stand
[1:12:41] up and say that
[1:12:44] everybody else you can't let what other
[1:12:45] people do dictate what your life is
[1:12:50] i've seen people that were so invested
[1:12:52] in what their parents would do or what
[1:12:54] their
[1:12:54] children would do or god had to show me
[1:12:56] that personally in my own life that
[1:12:58] no matter what other people do you've
[1:13:01] got to serve god
[1:13:03] and if you spend all your time worrying
[1:13:04] about what they're doing you have no
[1:13:06] time to be a christian yourself
[1:13:08] the best thing you can do for them is
[1:13:09] let them go let commit them to god
[1:13:11] pray for them and be a christian and
[1:13:14] that's hard to do i know that it is
[1:13:16] because i've had to do it
[1:13:18] i look he said choose this day whom you
[1:13:20] will serve best for me in my house we're
[1:13:22] making a commitment we're going to serve
[1:13:24] the lord
[1:13:24] the third house is the body of christ
[1:13:26] and i'm going to quickly go through this
[1:13:28] so that we can
[1:13:29] close the bible teaches us that the body
[1:13:32] of jesus christ was the house of god
[1:13:33] he said a body has to have prepared me
[1:13:36] the
[1:13:37] body has to have prepared me and so that
[1:13:38] was the house of god
[1:13:40] and so now when jesus died he it says
[1:13:43] in first corinthians 12 27 now you are
[1:13:45] the body of christ
[1:13:47] right and how does that happen on the
[1:13:49] day of pentecost we have it in measure
[1:13:50] he had it in full measure
[1:13:52] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:13:53] bodily
[1:13:55] right and now we have it by measure we
[1:13:57] have a measure of christ but it's the
[1:13:59] same but rather if you took a spoonful
[1:14:00] out of the ocean and
[1:14:02] and he said that's the ocean everything
[1:14:04] that's in the ocean is in that spoonful
[1:14:07] so you have god in you you are the body
[1:14:08] of christ and members in particular
[1:14:10] but together corporately or over the
[1:14:13] entire
[1:14:14] you could say the entire universe for
[1:14:16] the entire world you are
[1:14:18] a part of the body of christ you don't
[1:14:21] exist by yourself
[1:14:23] but we could say so that's your home
[1:14:25] that's where you belong and
[1:14:26] you have a church home somewhere local
[1:14:28] body that you belong to
[1:14:30] your partner you don't belong to it
[1:14:31] because you wrote a put a name out or
[1:14:34] your name on a piece of paper you filled
[1:14:35] out a survey or you do certain things
[1:14:37] but you belong to it because
[1:14:39] biblically you do what god said to do
[1:14:42] and you attend there and you and you
[1:14:44] congregate together you worship god
[1:14:46] together
[1:14:47] so you belong there now
[1:14:50] how you behave as we said in these other
[1:14:53] two houses matters to the church
[1:14:56] you can't separate those things
[1:15:00] you can't apply the token to just one or
[1:15:02] the other
[1:15:04] so i'll be a christian when i come to
[1:15:05] church you can't do that
[1:15:07] i can't do that i can't make my ministry
[1:15:09] different from my life you can't make
[1:15:11] your walk with god different your walk
[1:15:13] in the world different from your walk
[1:15:15] with god
[1:15:17] and so joshua 7 and 10 the lord said to
[1:15:20] joshua get the up
[1:15:22] wherefore lifestyle thus upon thy face
[1:15:24] now remember this is after ai
[1:15:27] and the children of israel had been
[1:15:29] defeated
[1:15:30] and there was a reason every time israel
[1:15:32] was defeated in battle there was a
[1:15:33] reason because
[1:15:35] they were undefeatable if that's the
[1:15:37] word
[1:15:39] they were there was no one that could
[1:15:41] overcome israel
[1:15:43] so when they lost there was a reason for
[1:15:45] it
[1:15:46] and they lost the battle and joshua gets
[1:15:48] on his face
[1:15:49] you see he knew that ultimately the
[1:15:51] responsibility was right there
[1:15:53] with the leadership and the lord said
[1:15:56] get up wherefore i shall thus upon thy
[1:15:58] face
[1:15:59] israel has sinned they've also
[1:16:01] transgressed my covenant which i
[1:16:02] commanded them notice what he says
[1:16:03] israel has sent
[1:16:06] they didn't all do it they didn't even
[1:16:07] all know about it
[1:16:11] but they've also transgressed my
[1:16:12] covenant which i commanded them for they
[1:16:14] have even taken of the accursed thing
[1:16:15] and have also stolen
[1:16:16] and assembled also and they put it even
[1:16:18] among their own stuff
[1:16:21] and aiken probably said this is just me
[1:16:24] i'll just take this and i'll go into the
[1:16:28] tent and
[1:16:29] get it nobody saw me i'm gonna keep this
[1:16:32] for my family
[1:16:34] my family will have gold they'll have
[1:16:36] this
[1:16:37] nice garment they'll have this this will
[1:16:38] be for my old age maybe my my social
[1:16:40] security
[1:16:41] no one else will see it it doesn't
[1:16:43] impact anybody but god saw
[1:16:47] and it we do in this house
[1:16:50] i hope you're hearing me today we're
[1:16:53] spiritual beings you recognize that
[1:16:55] we're spiritual what you do in this
[1:16:56] house what you do in this house the
[1:16:58] house you live in at home
[1:16:59] impacts what you do here and how you
[1:17:03] act here and aiken could have said it's
[1:17:06] just me
[1:17:06] it won't affect anybody he sneaks it
[1:17:08] back into his tent but it affected not
[1:17:10] just one person or some people but
[1:17:11] everybody
[1:17:14] in joshua 7 24 and joshua and all
[1:17:15] history with him
[1:17:17] took aiken the son of syria and the
[1:17:18] silver and the garment and the wedge of
[1:17:20] gold and his sons
[1:17:21] his daughters and his oxen
[1:17:25] his asses his sheep his tent why'd they
[1:17:28] have to destroy the tent
[1:17:29] you know he said we don't want to be
[1:17:31] identified with it at all
[1:17:33] all that they had they brought them into
[1:17:35] the valley of acorn joshua said why is
[1:17:36] that troubled us the lord shall trouble
[1:17:37] thee this day
[1:17:39] oh israel stoned him with stones and
[1:17:40] burned them with fire after they had
[1:17:42] stone with them stones this is extreme
[1:17:44] remember they were under the law i'm
[1:17:46] going to go to something else in just a
[1:17:47] moment
[1:17:48] they raised over him a great heap of
[1:17:49] stones under this day so the lord turned
[1:17:51] from the fierceness of his anger
[1:17:53] or before the name of that place was
[1:17:54] called the valley of acorn to this day
[1:17:56] that's all they could do
[1:17:58] aiken had done something so wrong that
[1:18:00] all they could do was just get rid of
[1:18:02] him
[1:18:02] destroy him destroy his family destroy
[1:18:04] his tent
[1:18:06] they destroyed this house and this house
[1:18:10] to save the house of god the people of
[1:18:13] god
[1:18:16] but don't you see that if you could get
[1:18:18] this house saved
[1:18:20] and this house saved redeemed as though
[1:18:22] they never did it in the first place
[1:18:25] very bad then that brings peace to this
[1:18:28] house
[1:18:31] we don't stone people today thank god
[1:18:34] for that
[1:18:35] i've reminded my kids a couple of times
[1:18:37] i know some of you fathers had you
[1:18:38] probably wouldn't admit it but of the
[1:18:40] punishment for disobeying your parents
[1:18:42] in the old testament
[1:18:45] thank god you don't live in the old
[1:18:46] testament you'd be stoned already
[1:18:51] no there's no instance that i know of in
[1:18:52] history where that ever happened but it
[1:18:54] was just
[1:18:54] it was an extreme punishment an extreme
[1:18:57] punishment because their parents would
[1:18:58] have to turn them in for that to happen
[1:19:00] and
[1:19:00] so that was a hard thing but aiken was
[1:19:03] stoned in his family
[1:19:04] we don't do that today we don't cast
[1:19:06] people out
[1:19:08] we don't do that today we don't cast
[1:19:11] people out
[1:19:12] why because of mercy because of grace
[1:19:16] and i'm so grateful that i was not cast
[1:19:19] out of this program
[1:19:21] because i made mistakes you made
[1:19:23] mistakes we don't get cast out
[1:19:25] but we're like the woman that was caught
[1:19:26] in adultery remember they were going to
[1:19:28] stone her according to the law
[1:19:31] and jesus come and wrote something in
[1:19:33] the sand he looked up he said he that
[1:19:34] was without sin
[1:19:36] here's a stone throw it
[1:19:40] and every one of them but a joke from
[1:19:42] the oldest to the youngest because as
[1:19:44] you get old i guess i can
[1:19:45] i can hang on to that today on my
[1:19:46] birthday as you get older you get
[1:19:49] understand a little bit more just how
[1:19:50] much of a sinner you were
[1:19:54] and and as they got older from the
[1:19:55] oldest to the youngest they left quietly
[1:19:58] because none of them was without sin
[1:20:01] every one of them deserved to be right
[1:20:03] there with her
[1:20:04] jesus was the only one who could have
[1:20:06] stoned her
[1:20:08] amen he didn't do it but what'd he say
[1:20:13] neither do i condemn thee oh look at the
[1:20:15] grace of god
[1:20:17] go sin no more
[1:20:20] so it's an awesome concept it's
[1:20:21] different than what what joshua had to
[1:20:23] do with he said go sin no more
[1:20:25] yes what you've done is impacted all
[1:20:26] these things but go sin no more
[1:20:28] and god can be with you go sin no more
[1:20:31] you can change the situation
[1:20:36] now brother branham always takes that
[1:20:37] and it says go send him more go
[1:20:39] disbelieve no more
[1:20:42] whatever brother whenever jesus would
[1:20:43] say that he says we have been given
[1:20:45] mercy
[1:20:47] and and what no that's that's what i'm
[1:20:49] saying to you we've been given mercy
[1:20:51] but if you won't take advantage of mercy
[1:20:53] in these houses
[1:20:54] this house your home
[1:20:58] you won't have mercy here in the
[1:21:00] congregation
[1:21:03] the congregation won't stone you the
[1:21:04] people won't judge you
[1:21:06] but you'll end up falling away
[1:21:09] because you failed to take advantage of
[1:21:11] mercy here
[1:21:13] mercy at home can you see it today
[1:21:17] church
[1:21:18] i don't mean to to pound you with these
[1:21:21] things
[1:21:22] but it's just what's on my heart and i
[1:21:23] have to preach what god tells me to
[1:21:24] preach
[1:21:26] if you don't take advantage of mercy in
[1:21:28] this house and this house the house of
[1:21:30] god will feel the impact
[1:21:35] aiken was destroyed his house was
[1:21:37] destroyed but listen before that
[1:21:38] happened innocent soldiers died
[1:21:42] and brother branham picks it up and
[1:21:43] presuming he said i can thought this
[1:21:44] little wedge it won't make any
[1:21:46] difference
[1:21:47] in today's communion day i want us to
[1:21:48] just examine ourselves and we don't have
[1:21:50] to
[1:21:50] to make a big show just examine
[1:21:52] ourselves when we leave here say lord i
[1:21:54] want to make sure that i'm right and i'm
[1:21:56] completely under the blood
[1:21:58] i've let you in every door in my my
[1:22:00] heart is open to you
[1:22:02] he said this little wedgie won't make
[1:22:04] any difference the rest of the ladies
[1:22:05] are cutting their hair i'll do the same
[1:22:06] thing
[1:22:06] it won't make any difference but what
[1:22:08] did it do it never brought pleasure to
[1:22:10] his family
[1:22:11] listen to that it never brought pleasure
[1:22:13] to his family he got it
[1:22:15] to bring pleasure to his family he said
[1:22:18] i'll do this
[1:22:19] but if i don't if i work seven days a
[1:22:21] week if i don't do if i keep all
[1:22:24] all these things and i i don't i'm not
[1:22:26] around the church
[1:22:27] when i get old then i'll give to the
[1:22:29] church and i'll have to give to my
[1:22:30] family no
[1:22:32] it never brought pleasure to his family
[1:22:37] oh when i get old i'll serve god but i
[1:22:39] make compromises now because
[1:22:41] in the workplace they they expect that
[1:22:43] and
[1:22:44] in other places they expect me to be a
[1:22:46] certain way and look a certain way so
[1:22:47] i'll make compromises in my life
[1:22:49] it won't make a difference i'll serve
[1:22:50] god one day
[1:22:52] but it never brought pleasure to his
[1:22:54] family
[1:22:55] it brought death to every one of them
[1:22:59] he said when we compromise on any
[1:23:01] commandment of god to please the people
[1:23:03] we kill the thing right there
[1:23:05] one little wedge one babylonian garment
[1:23:07] stopped the marching army
[1:23:09] brother one thing he said that we permit
[1:23:11] the church to do this wrong
[1:23:13] one thing that we won't call out against
[1:23:14] you realize where that puts me
[1:23:17] where that puts me as a minister of the
[1:23:19] gospel let's do it as a minister where
[1:23:21] that puts us
[1:23:22] one thing that we won't call out against
[1:23:25] make the people straighten it up it'll
[1:23:27] stop the march of the church
[1:23:29] they presume you're going on we may be
[1:23:32] in name
[1:23:33] we may be in numbers i think what counts
[1:23:34] that isn't what counts
[1:23:36] it's god with us god in us god moving
[1:23:38] through us is that what we want this
[1:23:40] morning
[1:23:41] his word alive in us he said don't
[1:23:43] presume that
[1:23:44] you don't presume that you know that he
[1:23:46] says
[1:23:48] don't presume that you know that god's
[1:23:50] in you don't
[1:23:51] don't presume that you know that god's
[1:23:53] with you
[1:23:54] because when they took the ark of the
[1:23:56] covenant and and hoffney and fine house
[1:23:58] have been doing what they'd been doing
[1:24:00] they went into battle with the ark of
[1:24:01] the covenant confident that it would
[1:24:02] save them
[1:24:04] confident that they would bring them
[1:24:06] victory against the philistines and it
[1:24:07] was taken
[1:24:08] and when the ark of the covenant was
[1:24:10] taken and finney house's wife heard
[1:24:11] about it and she and she was dying in
[1:24:13] childbirth she
[1:24:14] she named their son ichabod the glory of
[1:24:18] god has departed they didn't recognize
[1:24:19] it till it was already lost
[1:24:23] god's with me in my sin no he's not he's
[1:24:26] not with me and my sin either
[1:24:29] only when i make things right he's with
[1:24:32] me in the sense that he leads me to
[1:24:34] repentance
[1:24:35] but he doesn't condone my sin he doesn't
[1:24:38] bless my sin
[1:24:43] he said don't presume that you know that
[1:24:44] god's with you don't presume that you
[1:24:46] know that
[1:24:47] watch the way it makes you live the
[1:24:49] attitude you take towards
[1:24:50] sin he said why you think about a holy
[1:24:53] god
[1:24:54] did you ever think that one you're going
[1:24:55] to stand in his presence and
[1:24:57] give an account for this word and for
[1:24:59] christ when god is so holy setting
[1:25:01] yonder in eternity
[1:25:03] you know i think we need to we need to
[1:25:05] get an understanding of the holiness and
[1:25:07] awesomeness of god
[1:25:09] we need to understand who we're talking
[1:25:10] about god that created the heavens and
[1:25:13] the earth the god
[1:25:14] that can make that called us out of sin
[1:25:16] and make every little circumstance he
[1:25:18] knows
[1:25:19] everything that we've ever done in every
[1:25:21] little circumstance of our life
[1:25:22] we serve an omniscient and i'm not
[1:25:24] present god god who's everywhere who
[1:25:25] knows everything
[1:25:29] we serve an awesome god we serve a holy
[1:25:32] god
[1:25:34] and when we do things and i heard
[1:25:35] someone saying it just really stuck with
[1:25:37] me
[1:25:37] when we do things that are wrong
[1:25:39] especially in a position like mine or
[1:25:41] even as just a christian we know we're a
[1:25:43] christian but we do things we know are
[1:25:44] wrong
[1:25:45] when we do that we deny the omniscience
[1:25:47] of god
[1:25:49] because we tacitly tacitly anal
[1:25:52] acknowledge that if he knew about it he
[1:25:54] would do something about it
[1:25:57] but we say he doesn't know just by the
[1:26:00] way we act
[1:26:02] he said did you ever think that one
[1:26:04] you're going to stand in his presence
[1:26:07] and give an account for this word and
[1:26:09] for christ
[1:26:10] when god is so holy setting under an
[1:26:12] eternity when 10 million
[1:26:13] sons would be black spots before him
[1:26:16] so holy even the angels look filthy in
[1:26:19] his sight
[1:26:20] angels before him are filthy he said do
[1:26:22] you expect you and i with his word and
[1:26:24] the blood of his son to cleanse us from
[1:26:26] sin
[1:26:26] walk right over his commandments walk
[1:26:28] out into the world and expect to stand
[1:26:30] there blameless
[1:26:30] when you knew better than to do it
[1:26:34] oh church he said church better be
[1:26:36] straighten it up don't let us
[1:26:38] he said let us not presume this because
[1:26:40] we're bigger number than we used to be
[1:26:42] we're more financially better than we
[1:26:44] used to be we got better buildings than
[1:26:45] we used to have
[1:26:46] we would dress better clothes than we
[1:26:48] used to have we had better cars than we
[1:26:50] used to have but oh brother
[1:26:51] i wonder about christ how much is he
[1:26:54] with us
[1:26:56] that's it he said we're just presuming
[1:26:59] he said we have bigger numbers we have
[1:27:00] bigger buildings so we know he's with
[1:27:02] the snow
[1:27:03] how much is he with us how much is he
[1:27:06] really with us
[1:27:07] he's with us when we're with his word
[1:27:10] we're standing under
[1:27:11] the washing of the water of the word
[1:27:16] i want to talk to you about grace as we
[1:27:17] close musicians come
[1:27:21] before the death angel ever came the
[1:27:23] grace of god
[1:27:25] provided a token for the houses where
[1:27:28] they were at
[1:27:31] what grace that is to us today i don't
[1:27:34] want you to leave here thinking judgment
[1:27:35] or condemnation
[1:27:36] i want you to think about grace it's his
[1:27:39] grace it gave them a prophet with a
[1:27:41] message that said
[1:27:42] apply the token that's grace
[1:27:45] that's not judgment it was grace the
[1:27:47] egyptians had judgment they didn't have
[1:27:49] a prophet to tell them
[1:27:51] but but the israelites had a prophet to
[1:27:53] tell them apply the blood
[1:27:56] amen we've had a prophet to tell us
[1:27:59] these things is grace
[1:28:01] listen it's his grace that gave him a
[1:28:03] prophet with a message
[1:28:05] his grace provides a home like i said
[1:28:08] when we
[1:28:08] this body is dissolved we have another
[1:28:10] body waiting his grace provides a home
[1:28:13] a place where the token can be displayed
[1:28:16] i heard a story of a
[1:28:19] poor brazilian neighborhood and a young
[1:28:23] lady and her mother lived in that
[1:28:24] neighborhood
[1:28:25] and she was the girl become discontented
[1:28:28] with her home place
[1:28:30] she dreamed of a better life in the city
[1:28:33] one morning she slipped away
[1:28:35] breaking her mother's heart her mother
[1:28:37] knew what life on the streets
[1:28:39] of brazil would be like for a young
[1:28:42] attractive daughter
[1:28:44] her mother hurriedly went to find her
[1:28:47] mother knew her daughter had no way of
[1:28:48] earning money
[1:28:50] she also knew that her daughter was too
[1:28:51] stubborn to give up
[1:28:53] and so she went to searching through
[1:28:55] bars and hotels and nightclubs
[1:28:58] any place with a reputation for
[1:29:00] streetwalkers or prostitutes
[1:29:05] she went to them all at each place
[1:29:08] she'd went to a drug drug store and took
[1:29:10] a picture a black and white photo of her
[1:29:12] face
[1:29:13] and at every place where she went she
[1:29:15] left a picture of herself
[1:29:18] a little picture taped on a bathroom
[1:29:20] mirror
[1:29:21] attached to a hotel bulletin board
[1:29:22] fastened to a phone booth
[1:29:25] on the back of each photo she wrote a
[1:29:27] note
[1:29:28] it wasn't too long before money ran out
[1:29:30] she didn't have she wasn't able to
[1:29:31] search anymore she went home
[1:29:34] a few weeks later the daughter was in a
[1:29:36] hotel
[1:29:38] one of those countless hotels because as
[1:29:40] the mother knew her life had driven her
[1:29:42] that way
[1:29:44] and she was in a hotel and she noticed
[1:29:47] that she'd come down the stairs a small
[1:29:49] photo of her mother
[1:29:51] taped to the bulletin board she ran to
[1:29:54] the bulletin board and she pulled it off
[1:29:55] she looked on the back and this is what
[1:29:57] the mother had written
[1:29:59] whatever you've done whatever you have
[1:30:02] become
[1:30:03] it doesn't matter come home
[1:30:07] please come home
[1:30:11] that's grace
[1:30:14] whatever you've done it doesn't matter
[1:30:17] come home
[1:30:18] there's a token at home for you
[1:30:21] there's a there's a power that can
[1:30:23] cleanse you from every sin there's a
[1:30:25] blood that is effective
[1:30:27] come home and she did
[1:30:31] let's bow our heads do you know the
[1:30:32] songs softly and tenderly jesus is
[1:30:34] calling
[1:30:36] we're just going to sing that together
[1:30:37] and i don't as i said it doesn't take a
[1:30:39] big show
[1:30:41] and i trust that you're everyone
[1:30:43] christians this morning and
[1:30:44] made everything right with god i'm sure
[1:30:46] that's the case
[1:30:49] there's something in your life or maybe
[1:30:51] the life of someone who's watching today
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:56] you need to come home you need to just
[1:30:59] open up and let let god
[1:31:00] in he there's something you know it's
[1:31:02] the right thing to do and you just don't
[1:31:04] do it because of fear
[1:31:05] stubbornness or something a door that
[1:31:07] you just won't open you know
[1:31:10] maybe you're in a relationship or
[1:31:11] something that's not right or or you're
[1:31:13] you're doing something and nobody knows
[1:31:15] about it but it's just something that's
[1:31:16] not right
[1:31:17] you know that it's not right you know
[1:31:20] that it's not the right thing to do
[1:31:21] you can come home you can come home to

[1:41:34] verse before we sing it
[1:41:35] and then we'll go we'll let you go
[1:41:37] because we have communion at three
[1:41:39] but i just several
[1:41:42] folks come this morning to pray for
[1:41:44] loved ones said
[1:41:46] that are just in a bad place and need to
[1:41:48] come home
[1:41:49] i think every one of us have people like
[1:41:51] that in our lives we need
[1:41:53] them to come home and sometimes what
[1:41:56] needs to change is not so much
[1:41:58] them but us and our attitude of faith
[1:42:01] towards them to claim them to believe
[1:42:03] but david told me a story one time about
[1:42:05] that how he claimed his children and
[1:42:06] one and it was just over from that point
[1:42:08] he believed it i thought god let me do
[1:42:10] that
[1:42:11] just from that point it's over i believe
[1:42:13] it let me let me
[1:42:14] have confidence that you're they're
[1:42:16] going to come home and so much so
[1:42:18] they'll be like the father that was
[1:42:19] waiting
[1:42:20] and he saw the prodigal son come he was
[1:42:21] able to run to him
[1:42:23] come home amen we believe god can do
[1:42:27] that god can wake him up in the middle
[1:42:28] of a pig pen
[1:42:29] amen so you believe that today as we
[1:42:32] come together again at three o'clock for
