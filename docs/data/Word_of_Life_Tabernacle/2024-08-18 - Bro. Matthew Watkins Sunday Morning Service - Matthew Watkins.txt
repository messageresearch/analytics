it up in one simple phrase Lord You Are great Lord and your name is greatly to be praised Lord we just humble ourselves now before you Lord Jesus believing that the most important thing that we could do Lord above all else when We Gather when we sing when we preach when we praise Lord but above all the most important thing is that we touch you Lord I pray God that you would just come and take control now Jesus we just give it to you surrender in ourselves our vessels Lord I rais my hands up with anyone who would like to and just say Lord I Surrender my vessel now Lord just to say God if Lord if you want to speak then speak Lord I Just Surrender my heart my mind my spirit I pray God that you would have the complete control the complete preeminence Lord I pray God that you would father what a waste of time it would be Lord if we just gathered here and it just be us seeing each other that'd be good Lord but father can I just say I want to see you today Lord I want to see you Lord Jesus father I pray that you would just come and bless us Lord by your word as we give it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen certainly a privilege God bless you amen good to uh be here and uh so happy to be here with you and I just uh want to say to brother Ben thank you for having me amen and it's my first time getting to meet your pastor and brother Joel and his family there but I've just certainly felt right at home and uh I love the body of Christ I'm just glad to be part of the same family and uh and I believe that we uh come from different parts of the of the country I'm from South Carolina and you're from Arkansas but you know really truly we're not really from either place but actually our citizenship as Paul said is from above and so that's why we have something in common you know and you find that uh wherever you go and no matter what part of the world you travel in you just have an affinity you feel around Believers and uh brother brandham said what is that he said that's that true you that's that Zoey life inside of both of you amen and so you have something to Fellowship over so if you don't know me I'm brother Matt Watkins this is my first time ever speaking here and and uh and so I just bring you greetings from my father brother Jason Watkins and we're there on the on the east coast and we are about as far east as you can go before you drown so we are just right there in the hot humid South and uh really glad to just uh glad to be here amen and certainly this counted a privilege and an honor to be able to speak to you and and uh and so I get that out of the way just to say I I want to just be able to go right to the word amen I'm just going to pretend like I'm at home preaching and uh won't have any of those firsttime Blues preaching at a church so if you love the word then I got something in common with you because I do too amen and so we just want to uh be used of the Lord Jesus amen this morning I wonder if um if you have your Bible you could just turn to judges actually Numbers chapter 33 first and then we'll look at the Book of Judges amen Numbers chapter 33 and I just want to um minister to you this morning on something the Lord just brought back some inspiration to me just here recently spoke this just recently and you know when you go and travel somewhere and you Minister there's uh you know there's so many things that you're nervous about and you're uh you're you're waiting over and talking to the Lord and and uh you just there's anything let me just say that anything I would say today would be good and ain't because I'm a good preacher it's because the word we preach from is just a good word and anything you could preach would be good and be beneficial but I just want to say Lord out of everything that I could say today could you just use me to come and speak to a an individual amen an individual heart and so I I didn't brother Ben didn't give me the the rap He didn't sit me down and tell me give me all the notes things he wants me to preach on or say or give me any kind of intel on anybody and uh and I'm glad for that as an evangelist you come and you got to you got to you're lucky because you don't know any body don't know anything you can say what you want to say and uh and then brother Ben will pick up the pieces when you leave but um but I really want to be used of the holy spirit this morning and I believe he he uh he has something he wants to say Amen I'm going to minister to you and I'm going to title this called out of judges and into Ruth called out of judges and into Ruth Numbers chapter 33 and we'll just begin reading here down in Bible there at the very bottom at verse 51 we'll begin reading this is the Lord speaking through Moses and he speaks to Moses and he says this in the plains of Moab right by Jordan near Jericho so it's right before they cross over and he says speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before for you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein and notice the colon there in your Bible it's a conditional promise for I have given you the land to possess it so we know it's a promise and he says in ver verse 54 you shall divide it then in verse 55 says but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them shall be Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides now I couldn't imagine anything much more painful than a thorn in my eye prick in my eye thorn in my side and he says they'll become Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall Vex you in the land wherein you dwell moreover it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them look at Judges chapter one just look straight over there and we'll just read a few verses and have you be seated now I'm going to do something that our church at home loves this thing brother Ben it's a little onh hour timer on my watch praise the Lord see at my church they all set timers with me though and make sure you're not pausing that thing are you but U helps me to keep track of my time and so uh when Siri says I'm I'm over then I'm done then we'll we'll try to quit and when it stops I just tell our church we've stepped into eternity I'm just kidding don't worry Judges chapter 1 let's just begin reading here at verse 20 now this is the the record of of all the instruction everything that you had seen before and I just want to I'm going to just jump through a lot of this because I've spoken this in many parts and I don't I just want to feel what the Lord wants me to say today and then we'll move on but I want you to notice that he records this in numbers through a prophet you've got a promise you've got a prophet you've got instructions what more really do you need but the Bible records the record of these families these tribes of the victory or the defeat that took place in their life and he records this beginning we'll just be begin reading here at verse 21 and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day meaning the day that it was written verse 27 and neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth Sheen and her towns nor tanic and her towns nor the inhabitant of door in her towns notice move on down to verse 29 neither did Ephraim drive out the can Canaanites verse 30 neither did Zebulon verse 31 neither did Asher verse 32 verse 33 neither did Nepali and he goes all the way down of this list of partial Victory now remember that brother bham said that the the Canaan is not a type of the Millennium because there's still war right and so this was a record of the promise of or The Inheritance that God had promised them and then when they go over under the instructions the word of the prophet and they go under to take Victory and this is the record of what Tak takes place and what you find is a very sad picture that actually outside of Caleb that there was none of them that really fully possessed what God had given them and he comes down in Judges chapter 2 this is where we're just going to pick up our context here and I just we'll have you be seated Judges chapter 2 and an angel camea from the Lord came up from gilgal to bokeum and said I made you to go up out of Egypt eypt and brought you into the land which I sworn to your father and said I will never break my Covenant with you you shall make no league with inhabitants of this land you shall throw it on their altars but you've not obeyed my voice why have you done this wherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto you notice that lowercase gods and their gods shall be a snare or a trap and he says in the people in verse four when the angel of the Lord spoke these words un the children of Israel when the that the people lifted up their voice and wept called the name of the place bokeum and they sacrificed there unto the Lord Lord Jesus we just bow our heads before you asking for your Divine help now Lord how greatly I need you this morning Lord I'm no one nobody father I consider myself Lord the most unworthy Lord the least among these Lord that I speak to today God I I think about how many needs Lord is in my own family at my home Church lord it's just a mirror of I know no doubt there's many needs Lord here there's many mothers and fathers and husbands and wives and the pastor and the preachers and the whole body Lord we're all just your children Lord and if I could say we're all a needy people Lord if we ever needed you we need you right now yes I pray God that you would move me out of the way take this thought Lord that you've placed upon my heart God I just become subservient Lord now to your spirit I move myself completely out of the way Lord and I'll just follow your lead may you come and and feed your children we ask it we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated the prophet of God says here in the message Redeemer and Redemption and this is quoting actually uh this is the the third slide brother if you're going to follow me you could display that if they have that he says during the time of the judges when the first thing there come a time when Israel got away from God when they did the water supply was withheld and when people get away from God today the water supply is withheld and all other blessings will be withheld held it's amazing I don't have time so much today but it's incredible really if you go home and you read and study the Book of Judges you'll find this phase or this this this uh spot where we know that brother Bon shows us that God LED them through prophets and then through priests and then through Kings and this was that Port that portion or that phase that he's leading them through judges now that word judge is not judicial as you would think of a judge who would sit and pride over the Affairs of men but actually that English word is savior it's the same word we use for Jesus saves it just means delivers and so these men that God put over them was a time where God would deliver them from their oppressors we find this actually if you just look and you could just do a quick study in slide number two brother I'm not controlling it I have some of these but the king of Jericho would be an oppressor and then God would send oel king of Moab would come and and he would send a man named Ehud the ammonites and he would have a shamgar we all know that story The amalekites and he would send a Deborah or baric the Philistines with Gideon you also know the story of Samson and abdden and all these men that the Bible records and we notice that it was actually something as the prophet of God said everything in the Old Testament was a shadow or a type of something that would have a greater fulfillment as God's plan unfolds you see history is all God's plan all right in fact history just means his story and so it was all the unfolding story of God's Redemptive plan from the beginning and everything that's included in that both righteous deeds and unrighteous Deeds evil men and righteous men as the Bible says in the Apostle Paul says in the house of God are many vessels some to honor some to dishonor he points to pharaoh and says for such a purpose I've risen thee up and so all of everything that's happened from the beginning of time has been God's history or God's story and we notice that the prophet further tells us about the Book of Judges that the Old Testament had Church ages seven just like the Gentile Church in a shadow the old in the ages would have a greater fulfillment how many knows that that the prophet said that everything that you read has compound meaning and so we know they would have an application at that time when it was written but it would actually have a greater fulfillment or a greater application as Paul says these things were written for our examples of whom the ends of the Earth have come and so God moving towards his promise or moving towards his plan so you can always see that what God was doing in this Book of Judges as we find would just be a pattern that would actually play out through history it's incredible because if you go and study the Book of Judges you'll find one Keith refrain that is repeated it over and over and you'll find it in judges beginning in judges 16 you'll find it in chapter 17 you'll find it in chapter 18 and it's this one verse that says in those days there was no King and so the people did that which was right in their own eyes friends I don't know of anything that could be more uh applicable or a description of the world that we currently live in right now to where the world has lost their absolutes it's a world to where their their own moral compass or their own uh what they think is right and you could say that that's the ENT what's leading the world today is is a spirit to say don't tell me what to do I'll do what I want to do if don't tell me how to live I'll live how I want to live and and people have gone crazy the world's gone crazy a man doesn't know what a man is a woman doesn't know what a woman is schools don't know which bathroom to use it's a world and I know I'm preaching to you these are kind of things that aren't just at home in South Carolina they're they're here in Arkansas they're WR down I don't care where you from listen I'm I'm glad I'll be honest with you as I travel the the the the you know the North America and all through the world I'm glad I was born in the United States of America I'll be further and say I was glad I was born in the South and I hope that's not offensive to anybody but I am I go places and I'm really glad I'm born in the what they call the Bible Belt and you got churches you know but let me just stop here and say that it doesn't matter now where you go doesn't matter what sea you're on doesn't matter what Coast you're in doesn't matter what country you're from the tidal wave of the depravity of mankind has spread from sea to Sea and the entire world the Bible says in Revelations that they have dranken from the wrath of her fornication they've they've became intoxicated this is the age that you live in it's an age to where the minds of men have they've lost their mind it's a neurotic age and you deal with it every single day and so I'm getting away from my notes and and to be honest I'm the most comfortable when I'm away from them but let me just say that it's it's a world that's completely lost their mind they they they and and they've they've went insane and you say brother Matt why why did that happen I'll tell you why it happened because a white house is not controlling the world a a president is not controlling anything people vote and that's fine but let me just say that there's one thing that controls history and it's a book of Prophecy that they've rejected and kicked out of their schools and kicked out of our society and they don't realize it's the very thing that is controlling World in modern events and so we know that this this this time of Judges was actually it was like as brother the prophet of God points to the church ages through the Old Testament and actually if you go study that Book of Judges you'll see that that refrains repeats over and over that everybody did that which was right I'm going to just read it to you in judges 17:6 in those days there was no King and every man did that which was right in his own eyes and so that's the key that you can find in the Book of Judges it's a constant message that's repeated and in fact you'll find that there's a pattern we're going to look at it here let me not get a too far ahead of myself but let's look at it here in Judges chapter 2 if you have your Bible just follow along with me here for a moment and the Bible says in verse 7 if you could just turn up this one right here brother I'm not I don't hear so well on my right side but if the left side if they have it that'd be wonderful just a little more notice in verse 7 and the people serve the Lord all the day so you know what you have here is God tells them you know that that that you didn't drive out and because of that because of the failure of one generation it's going to become the curse of the Next Generation and actually that's always a pattern that you'll find as the that the failure of the preceding generation or the victory that they could get would very likely determine how much Victory the next would get John Wesley said something so powerful he said what one generation tolerates the next generation will embrace you could find it in history because it's it's a repeating pattern as the old poet says the the people are doomed to repeat history because they never learn from history and so it's a repeating pattern that always continues to repeat that that it was in the days of Judges that they so God God tells them because you didn't get Victory because you didn't drive them out because you didn't complete have a complete Victory and you stopped short of the promise of God because of that it's going to come to pass that those things which you let remain are going to be Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall Vex you now these were not ungodly people this was actually the same group of people that came out of Egypt on under a prophet through God's word through God's prophet and notice in Judges chapter 2 God says you have not obeyed my voice that's right now God never said nothing but through a prophet God actually equates the instructions through Moses as his own voice and says when you heard from Moses you were hearing from my heart right and you've not obeyed my voice why have you done this yes it's incredible because you watch as this story unfolds they begin to cry they weep they make a sacrifice and the Bible says something so amazing that it says in verse 10 Joshua in verse 8 Dies they bury him in verse 9 in verse 10 that generation were gathered un their fathers and there arose another generation after them so the curse that God pronounces actually people live their entire life and they never see the Fulfillment of that curse that's right it's not until the next generation of young people who are raised in the message and the Bible says that there raises up an entire generation which knew not the Lord which knew not the works which he had done and they the children of Israel served did even in the sight of the Lord and served balam notice this and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers come on yeah I mean if we listen friends remember this is just a shadow this is just a repeating pattern because what you'll find in judges is a circle yeah come on and you'll notice that I'm preaching to you on caught out of judges and into Ruth right come on because you'll notice that judges is actually actually a pattern that repeats yes to where God would send them a deliverer right they would they would come under Revival under that deliverer and then when that deliverer would die or that judge the Bible says the Bible says they would then begin to sin again they would go back into bondage worse than the first time and then they would come to a stage of repentance and God would send another deliverer and then there would be Revival and then that Revival that judge would die and then they would go back into sin and then back to slavery and then back you can see it's just a circle from revival to the death of the judge to repentance to sin back to slavery back to corruption back to Revival and if you study the Book of Judges you'll find something incredible that that cycle of Revival and death repeats seven times that's right and it's incredible when you think of that correlation as brother in the Ephesian Church age shows us that pattern in the ages and he says the Ephesian age was just like Israel yeah and he says that they demanded a king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected God but that's the history of the church notice this so that entire generation raises up the Bible says they don't know the Lord they forsook the Lord God of their fathers and they said they served Bell and asero and notice in verse 14 the Ang Lord was hot against them and he delivered them the hand of their spoilers verse 15 whatsoever they went the hand of the Lord was against them for evil verse 16 nevertheless the Lord raised up judges oh yes and yet they would not verse 17 hearken under their judge but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the ways of their father which their fathers walked in obeying the Commandments of the Lord but they did not so in verse 18 says and when the Lord raised up judges then the Lord was with that judge oh yes notice this and he says when the Lord raised up judges the Lord was with that judge and delivered them out of the hand of the enemy all the days of the judge and so we see this pattern I know I don't have to go through so much Foundation because you're Believers here today but you know that a prophet shows us how that under each messenger that God would a a trumpet would sound which what was that trumpet that was a shout or a trumpet a gospel trumpet that the prophet said would gather the bride under that messenger together right and brother bam says but notice what would happen that man would die it' go off the scene he said and the people God would put his bride away the elect of that age to sleep and then the people would denominate around the man's teachings I'm just preaching in what a prophet tells you in the church age book and they would denominate around that man's teaching and brother bham says a plague would fall death would settle in and so you notice this is exactly what takes place in judges that as long as the messenger was there as long as the Revival under that messenger was there there was Revival in the church there was Revival in the meetings uh you know there there was just a Burning Flame but when that messenger leaves then that Revival begins to fade the fire begins to die and then the people would form a denomination around his teachings and then brother bam says and then that pattern just repeats and so notice as long as the judge was alive they would serve the Lord the B that's what we just read and the Lord is with that judge and he says he says all the days of the judge notice this here in verse 19 and it came to pass this is an important word you could preach a sermon right here when the judge was dead yeah that's right yeah yeah you know what never ceases I hope I can just be real with you and transparent just be myself but it never ceases to amaze me because I've witnessed it with my own eyes it's so incredible how you watch the lives of some people and actually only circumstances will reveal what that person is actually anchored to it's amazing because they can go for years and it looks good they look like Believers and it's as long as that Papa or that Ministry or that father or that church as long as they're alive then that family looks like Believers dresses like Believers talks like Believers knows all the good things to say is at every meeting and it's amazing because I've watched it as long as that testimony or that judge you would call a pillar I'm just going to slow down here for a moment because of that pillar and that pillar sometimes in a family doesn't realize what his testimony is holding and what will happen is you'll always watch people and as long as that judge or that father or that preacher or whatever it is if they're only anchored to the testimony of that man and they're never anchored to Christ brother random says I'm afraid we're getting people to church we're getting into a Doctrine we're getting them to an idea but we're not getting them to Christ yes sir now now I I'll just say that that even that word Christ could become I hate to say this but a generic term because I'm not talking about just a Jesus of of of of the of the even Jesus of the stories of the Bible it's wonderful to know the stories of Jesus of the Bible but you got to have an anchor that goes further than the letter because the letter kth so you got to know I'm not just talking about Jesus as everybody knows him as Jesus of Nazareth I'm talking about the the Christ who was revealed in this generation and when a person never meets that Christ then watch what happens to people's lives when that judge dies what it reveals is is that their testimony was only ever anchored to that man or that Ministry or that church and when that man falls away or leaves the message or leaves the church and you watch I'll just go and preach it here you watch how people are they you know that they it's incredible because the church almost gives a life of its own and it can deceive many people to think that they're actually connected to to Christ when they're really only living off the life of the church and you'll always notice it because as long as the church is good to them then Christ is good to them then they love Jesus and they're going to heaven and you know they they they want the Lord but watch when that church is not good to them when that church fails them because churches will fail you and people will fail you and pastors will fail you and let me go further fathers will fail you I failed my children many times I'll just be honest and and and and you watch whenever that the if they only anchor to that then the second that that whatever that is fails them then they don't just leave the church they leave everything it's sort of like a boat that's floating on the tide you always you're fine you know when you're there anchored I've been on the Buford River many times and man when you're anchored you don't even notice that there's a tide you don't even notice that there's a current but you pull up that anchor let that anchor get pulled up one time and it may not look like much at first but after about five minutes you realize hey I'm a little further from the bridge having to cast a little further what's going on here what you don't realize is that your anchor has been pulled oh come on your anchor has been pulled and you're just drifting down the die and I've watched people in their lives and and as long as the Papa was there and he believed the message but Watch What Happens the second that that judge dies then suddenly they look like Believers for a little while and then they start to change their manner of dress their attitudes their behavior they become relaxed drifting that's what Ephesus means relaxed and drifting come on and then you watch after a while poof they're gone and you say what happened this is the pattern of Judges that as long as the judge was alive listen to what brother random says here this is the Ephesian Church age prophet of God said now history keeps repeating itself notice I got these in Red so that you can just catch them history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading right so this is the pattern it's the same exact pattern as judges brother random says you see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading and in the Next Generation brother bandam says in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated notice what he says here some of the and I I could preach about a Revival of a church of an age of a of I don't care what you but how about we talk about our own here today how about we point the microscope just a little further than just generally and say Lord shine a light down right here where are you at this morning because you notice brother Brandon gives you the signs or the symptoms of a Dying Revival brother bam says the fervent desire to please God oh my the passion the passion oh my the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it's cooled off and became a bit formal that's what was happening back there to the Ephesians that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like other nations the prophet says when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that is the history of the church now I'm not talking about neither is the prophet talking about the bride notice the the separation here this isn't the history of the elected this is the pattern of the church because you notice what you'll find is is the brother bam says that God at the seventh age notice I'm just going to go off my notes Here for a moment that in the first age it was the Alpha and the prophet said that was Christ that was what it Paul had he had the abstract the token zoy life he had the abstract the full abstract to the title sir and brother baram says but notice in that first age the alpha it was all Christ but he said through the age of the reformers through the age through the church ages the prophet said they had dips of the Holy Ghost but he says it wasn't all Christ right that's why Luther could smoke a pipe believe in a trinity and God could wink at that ignorance come on because brother Bram says they could only serve him under the strength that's my word not his they could only serve him under the strength of the word or the token life that had been released for that age right and brother bham says that notice here in those middle in those ages he said it was all the the first was all Christ under that Alpha but in those under that Reformation the prophet says and Paul says in Corinthians that God in times past has winked at the ignorance but now he requireth that all men repent in other words what are you saying brother Matt what I'm saying to you is you are not living under a partial releasing of the token Life of Christ but actually at the crucifixion of the word in this generation would produce the same power oh come on somebody help me Preach Today brother baram says that under that token light and I'm getting away way way way far away but I'm just going to preach that brother bam says that notice that that that token the prophet says that when that believer took that lamb into his home and he would go through that 14-day inspection period and the prophet links that 14 days of inspection to the ages to the age of the reformers that they didn't have the Zoe life all they had was the lamb before it was crucified before it was slain but brother brandom says but in the evening time it wasn't going to be an inspection of a lamb just looking at his word and looking at what maybe they probed at or thought what a Believer looked like or thought what the Holy Ghost was they thought it was a gift of the Holy Ghost they thought it was speaking in tongues and it is as part part of the Holy Ghost is the gifts of the Spirit but you can have his gifts and not have him you can have his word and not even have him brother bam says you might speak in tongues you might not you can have but listen friends what came in this generation was not just going to be another dress code or a Doctrine or a thinking or some kind of intellectual knowledge or even a what what was going to come was not just some outpouring of emotion but it was going to be the life of the Lamb would come back on the believer and the Very Zoey token literal Life of Christ that's why brother brandom could say it's not just a work of the Holy Ghost it is the Holy Ghost himself and so notice this here it was it was under those ages that brother bam says that you notice here and let's just pick it up how the prophet says it he says that second generation coming almost just like Israel that's the history of the church it isn't long until you see them stop doing things that they and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they change their manner of dress isn't it so incredible that some of the first things people do when they leave the message is they change their manner of dress I know it seemed so simple friends but I don't believe it's really that simple as simple as you think it is you see to a person who doesn't have a revelation of Christ then the message is just dos and don'ts and rules of what you don't do and you don't do and you don't do and you don't do but what do you do if all we have is a rule book of dos and don'ts and that's the sad part about many people is they get cleaned up the Bible says they get clean they get empty but they never get filled and one of the most dangerous spots you can be as a Christian as a person is a person who's clean but empty in fact Jesus says you were better dirty and full of sin than to be clean but empty that's right isn't that incredible true that when the unclean Spirit leaves a man it goes into dry places and he cometh and find the house swept notice there's nothing more dangerous to a Believer than being cleaned up but not full and you become a negative Christian what does that mean that means I don't do this and I don't do that and I don't do this and I don't do that and I don't go here and I don't do do that I don't wear that I don't watch that you have all of the you you've removed the pleasure of sin come on but you don't have any joy of the Holy Spirit come on and Jesus says that the condition of that man is worse than before the spirit left the man that's right that's why the older brother to the prodical son was in a worse condition than the prodical son living with pigs yeah and he was at church his whole life and he said Lord I've done all these things and and notice what happens the second that his brother comes home he gets mad and gets angry at all the music and shouting and dancing and he says what is this I hear my stinking rotten low down good for nothing brother and I was here father this is go read this in luk the book of Book of Luke and he says I was here the whole time I was in church I never transgressed thy commandment what was it that was older brother syndrome who was clean from sin but empty of the Holy Ghost on and I've done all these things and I've never transgressed your commandment and I was at church every Sunday and I I paid my TI and I I was there every time Dad I was I never failed you I never went out like this but and he notice he says but the second that this my brother who's been living in sin in the filth of sin right the second he comes home you put a ring on his finger and put a clo SM on him and you kill the fatted calf ain't that how some people are they can't get they get so upset when someone has the joy of the Holy Ghost come and notice what the father says he says my son you have been ever with me and all of these things have been here the whole time in other words Revival was always for you but you never made your availed yourself to it the joy of the Holy Ghost was always there but you never availed yourself to it the fatted calf was always here we could have always had it come on and notice this here this brother Adam says they change their attitudes and their behavior they get lack that's what Ephesus means relaxed and drifting notice I know you know this very well he says that cycle next slide of Revival and death has never ever failed I have this here and you can go to the next slide and we don't have to teach on this too much but I'll to show you that actually for seven years this pattern repeats from sin to slavery to repentance and then to deliverance and actually you go through the entire Book of Judges and I couldn't even today read you the entire book you have to go read it for yourself if you go read the End of This Book it's a horror story and it's not a record of the bites it's not a record of the amorites it's a record of the Israelites and their life becomes into such chaos hold on come on because they lived and I just want to preach here for a moment they lived in that judges cycle yeah come that judges pattern that ever repeats over and over and over and over again it just continues to repeat every man did that which was right in his own eyes if it feels right must be right if it looks right must be right and what's right for you might not be right for me but what's right for me is what's right for me your truth may be your truth but my truth is my truth and we might both be right well that's not what Jesus said and we live in such a pattern to where they get in that judges cycle and they don't even realize it that their life is just and listen friends I'm talking about a experience that Believers people can get into such a condition they don't even realize that for 30 years they've been living in a circle they've been living in just a repeated pattern of good victory here as long as there's Revival man they're on fire but then the minute that that dies they go right back into sin and then they go right back into slavery because sin always always leads to slavery that's true and then they go right back into slavery then God comes again and special meeting Youth Camp preacher some experience Calamity happens crisis takes place and man they're at the altar again and they're repenting again and they live forever on this pattern come on and it's a constant circle of Judges come on you say brother Matt what will determine I'm going to tell you what would determine it the prophet of God said when people get away from the word when their lives get away from the word they get away from God and the water supply is withheld and they can go for years I've watched people suffer under the listen I'm not talking I'm not I'm not talking about uh you know I'm talking about good people who love the Lord but they go in this repeated pattern of judges of good times and bad times times of up times of down some moments of Victory some moments of defeat victory in the mountain no victory in the Valley come on and you watch people live their life like a roundabout right and they they get on the roundabout of life and they go around and around and around and around and around and around and they they you know that roundabout of life when you you know you you you grow up and you you get a job and you get a career and then you get married and then after you get married you have children and then you have a home and then you get on that roundabout and you you go to work and you work eight hours then you come home you say hello to the family you veg on entertainment you go to bed you wake up you go to work you work eight hours you come home greet the family veg on entertainment you go to bed you wake up you work eight hours you come home you greet the family you veg on entertainment you go to bed you wake up you work8 hours you come home and then you greet the family then you veg and entertainment then you go to bed you wake up you work 8 hours you come home and you do that for about 30 years then you retire and then you get off the roundabout about where you got on and that's life and people go around and around and around and around in judges and they never come out of judges and enter the story you see Ruth Life Starts in this pattern that's where she's from that's her history that's who she is that's where she should have died that's where her life should have just been another tragedy of Judges she's a moabit she has no business being there with Naomi it's no different than the man she marries and her father and her mother his mother saw boaz's mother and you notice Rahab had no business being in the lineage of Christ she should have died with the rest of Jericho she's just a nobody living on a wall prostituting herself there was no Torah red in Jericho there was no local church she could go to she was just another casualty a part of the wicked age of lady oia just another Atomic f for atomic age but Grace but somehow I don't know how you say how did she find herself I don't know how she found herself what did she do brother Matt how do we find her name I'm going to tell you how she believed the words of the messengers she said I know a god I've heard about a god listen friends do you realize she believed in a God that she only ever heard about she'd never seen him she'd never talked to him she' never sat in church she'd never had the opportunities but she believed the words of the messenger and the Bible say she said give me a true token oh and because she believed the words of a messenger of Joshua God said here's an inside here's a token and that token's not just going to be for you little Rahab it's going to be for your children it's going to be for your daddy for your mama for your whole family I'm talking about this token Hallelujah sir she shouldn't have been there she had no business being there and Ruth had no business coming out of Judges somehow she finds herself she had no business being there she should have died with the rest of them oh I think of God's Prophet as he sat there on that little bank and the brother brandham says my family he said the Brams were just Fighters and drunks and alcoholics my mama and my daddy think about that s years old and he's laying there on a bank fishing trying to there you know thinking about his life he's thinking about how the night before he was laying on that bank till 3:00 in the morning waiting for the party to end at his daddy's house laying there on the roof of that watching the Moonlight not wanted to go home to be around that filth say what are you saying brother Matt I'm saying that had Satan had his way he would have died another brandom he would have been just like his dad he would have been just like his mama he would have been just like his history he's laying there and brother Von says I I was laying there waiting for the music to end daddy and mommy says party and there the the music and the alcohol think about that a little seven eight year old boy and he's laying there one night and he and he and he and he says uh he says there it was in the snow and I built me a little fire the next summer brother Bam's fishing and he says I I look down and he says there I was fishing he says I look down thinking of about his life and he says and I noticed a Little Flower and he says that Little Flower came up and I looked and I said hey how'd you get there yeah brother Bon says you shouldn't be here he says I I build a fire over top of you and he says that should have killed you not only that he says uh he says the snow was here last here and he says it froze you over and he says but look at you you made it look at you you're here oh my brother my sister look at you look at your life you'd be honest there'd be anywhere you'd be but in the house of God believ in a token message there'd be anywhere you should have been any other place you should have been another statistic of this wicked age but somehow you're here somehow I want to serve the Lord somehow in spite of everything the devil has sent in my life I still got to do desire to say I want to be like Jesus I want to live the word of God in my life somehow the prophet of God said I looked and said you shouldn't be here Little Flower but somehow you're here he said at that moment a voice spoke and said you are not the son of Charles and El brandom but your identity is in Christ in another dimension had man had his way he would have been another random oh somehow Grace yes sir Ruth you should have died yeah you should have been another statistic of that roundabout of Life yes oh my you should have just died there Ruth you don't know something so powerful brother Joel if you go study the Tanakh and you look at a Jewish Bible in your Bible Judges and Ruth are two books but did you know in the original Hebrew Bible judges and Ruth are the same book see brother Matt what does that mean what I'm trying to tell you is they're not two different stories in other words your story doesn't have to end in judges but there's a new beginning come on I'm talking about a new story I'm talking about God rewriting your life how the devil would have written it and you think of how it would have ended and that the the tragedy of the end and end but God said no that's not how it's going to end I'm going to call that little girl out of that judges cycle out of the pattern of her daddy and her mama and the destruction of her family and I'm going to join her to a man named Boaz and she's going to come off of the circle you see Ruth is not a circle Ruth is a straight line you say what line brother man it's a path of redemption it's a path of the lineage of Christ and your identity is not in this world that's why why you can't fit in that's why you're not comfortable here you're only comfortable in the house of God worshiping the Holy Ghost because that's who you really are loud environment I use this as a gauge to know whether I'm in the right place I get scared when that loud warning go doesn't go off brother Jo good come on sir trying to look at my timer thank you Siri notice this here because you'll find can we go a little bit further you'll find that actually this pattern even brother Bron picks this up you can find this pattern in jehoash and second Kings turn in your Bible if you could you can look at it with me too I've got actually on the slide verse slide nine this is 2 Kings 12 I want you to notice because what you're going to find is that just like a father had Victory and then a son comes along and notice the life of Solomon you're going to find something in your Bible that Solomon brings in that David never brought in you'll never find these things under the worship of David but actually under his son because he has many strange wives he brings in this way of worship that the Bible refers to as a high place how many has read that in your Bible before and it was a Canaanite way of worship to where they would take a high place and they would worship upon that high place and then this plague enters the children of Israel and the temple worship is mixed in with this Canaanite worship and you'll find that actually those high places that Solomon gets from the Canaanite women now listen I I can imagine when he first brought it into church man it was just a gasp people couldn't believe it they couldn't believe it it was just I couldn't believe he would do that but you know after you you can think something against it but if you don't make a change then after a while it becomes a little easier to to digest then a little and it sort of offends you at first but then after a while you you just sort of get used to it and then after a while brother Brandon said it starts as a saying and then it moves to a you know a do then it becomes the irrefutable Doctrine then they crown him and it's amazing how you watch people's lives at first if brother bam talked about lot and said lot the sins of Sodom and vexed Sodom vexed his righteous soul but he didn't have the plain gumption to say something about and he tolerated it and what one generation tolerates the Next Generation Embraces and so no doubt at first it was egregious but after a while it just it'ss there people get more used to it more used to it more used to it until eventually it's just what we do and this generational curse I know you've heard that many times before but this is a real one you're actually looking at that generational curse that Solomon brings in plagues good men good Godly men Good Men Who feared the Lord but they could never go past and I'm filling the Holy Spirit here come on they could never break the ceiling they could never go past as far as Daddy went that's how far they went yes and as long as he walked in the ways of God then they seem like they could go that far come on listen friends let me just say this you will never lead a person to a place you've never been all right come on you can emotionally want to and think but if you've never entered there yourself how can you lead others to come that's why a father can never really lead his children to the Token if he's never really been led to the Token himself come on you'll never lead your children in true unadulterated worship if you've never got it yourself come on and so so as long as the father got there then the children seem like they could I want you to notice in 2 Kings 12 in verse 1 because the writer of Kings would always list the name of the king his age his mother's name and then it would always say one or two things he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord or it'll say he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord that's right and then it will link his life to his natural lineage right of his father now notice second Kings chapter 12 verse one in the second year of juu jehoash began to Reign and 40 years reigned he in Jerusalem his mother's name was Z of berseba and jehoash did that which was right can somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord come on say it with me he did that which was right right the Lord praise the Lord he's a good man he's a Godly Man good King good boy wanted to serve the Lord had it in his heart purposed it in his heart he wants to walk in the ways of God but notice the disclaimer he did that which was right all his days wherein jeod the priest instructed him verse three but but but yeah the high places were not taken away the people sacrificed and burn incense in the high places chapter 14 of 2 Kings verse four verse one the second year of joash son of jehoash king of Israel amiah the son of joash King of Judah he was 25 years old and began to rain R 29 years and verse three says and he did that which was right praise the Lord oh that was weak come on we got four of you can we get 40 he did that which was right praise the Lord praise the Lord thank god he's a good man he wants to serve the Lord he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord notice this yet aha aha so you mean it's not just good enough to want to do that which was right in the sight of the Lord yet not not like David hold on brother Joel David is not this man's father you see but somehow there's a link come on between natural lineage and Heavenly lineage notice yet not like David his father he did according to all things as joash his father did so as much Victory as joash had this boy could likely he'd get that much too but wherever the Father the generation call it a preacher a pastor a church doesn't matter what it is as long as they're only linked to an Earthly lineage come on then they're Bound by that Earthly lineage and the prophet of God says you say B that's not so bad my daddy was a good man my mom well that's good praise the Lord not everybody has that testimony come on but let me just say something do you hear today the prophet of God said that out of the grab bag of life you didn't choose this but every single one of you have idioc secenes and tendencies and things that bother you things that you war against things that bother your flesh listen I know they're good people here in Arkansas but but we are too in South Carolina we got to share we got our Fair share problems as you got here come on and you got good people but notice out of that grab bag of Life the prophet of God said there's certain things that come that you inherit from your mother and your father or your grandfather or your grandmother and you didn't ask for those things did anybody anybody here did did y'all did anybody here do we have anybody here that was born and before you were born like on a video game you got to choose how tall you would be how how much you'd weigh you know the color of your hair the darkness of your skin your complexion anybody oh so you mean you didn't you mean you didn't get to choose your own life or what you look like you didn't get to choose what things bothered you what things you didn't bother what things didn't bother [Music] you that's why brother ROM says some men are certain way and other men are not and if you ever try to get one man to try to relate to another he'll always criticize him because he doesn't struggle with that that's right come on but let me say just because you don't struggle with it don't mean it's not real listen there many things that I can't relate to of certain people but I promise there's many things that bother me that you can't relate to and let me just say I've got to fight my battle and you've got to fight yours stop trying to tell me how to fight mine I'll stop telling you how to fight yours that's the prophet of God said just block your man and we'll get the touchdown after a while and notice here it was something in his life that he couldn't help Paul said the creature made subject in other words he's a slave he's he's he's subservient he says he's made subject to vanity he's created that way come on not willingly but by reason of the S of him who created him the same in Hope come on and so in other words he doesn't choose it it's just part of his Canaan that he's got to conquer and brother and notice here in the scripture he did that which was right how be it it verse four the high places ain't it amazing it points straight to that every single time how be it he never could break it he did that which was right praise the Lord but he can never overcome this Azariah 27th year jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah the son of amaziah 16 years old was he when he began to reain young man his mother's name he did that verse three and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord praise the Lord but according to all his father and Messiah had done he did that which was right according to all his Earthly lineage you see some people can walk their entire life and never step out of Judges come on and that judges cycle is just walking in the ways of your Earthly lineage he notice save verse four that the high places were not removed right jotham verse uh 32 I got three minutes left we're going to have to go in a little bit of Eternity here I hope you can hold with me here for a moment and the second year PE of the son of Ralia verse 32 began jotham the son of Uzziah 5 25 years old was when it begin to rain and verse 34 and he did that which was right he did that which was right he's a good King he did according to all that his father Uzziah how be it the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burn incense still in the high places he was never set free he never entered the land of Bethlehem Judea Ruth could have stayed on that same cycle you see he had never entered notice this here brother Bon picks us up in Paradox he says for instance a few moments ago he begins to tell about this young man and he says I was called to a little something and there was a fine young man very fine boy going with a little girl very fine little girl and a fine family this boy all of a sudden come up with something some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl as much as promised her to do a certain thing and he didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't in him right right now that's an important word come on it just wasn't in him what was in him brother Matt a good boy we just learned it he's a fine young man had a good daddy good Mama good raisin but this wasn't in him he just couldn't say sorry right on some people say sorry but they're never really saying sorry on right can I just say something here you don't realize the power of forgiveness come on that's right and you don't realize the Liberty I have watched it set families free when God starts with a man maybe a woman maybe a young person I don't care who it is yeah and when that person can can I know it's so simple but when they can really look at themselves and as brother bradam says I looked in the mirror and I realized the biggest enemy I got is staring me back in the mirror say who gets in the way brother Bram says William brandham gets in the way he just couldn't apologize it just wasn't in him father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire we would desire to know what's wrong with our boy EAS you brother Brandon says no it's not easy to do sometimes you're right it's not come on but you must be truthful and honest therefore the boy was a Christian praise the Lord somebody say with me praise the Lord he was a Christian as far as a Believer he had repented good praise the Lord had been baptized praise the Lord had his position among Believers Lord but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit come on no matter how much he thought he had now notice how brother Bram deciphers that he hasn't received the Holy Spirit notice what he says you thinking you have it and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion oh so brother Brandon wasn't looking at emotion or no emotion but unless your life unless your life come on is vindicating what you're professing to have still you haven't got it right no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensation speaking in tongues shouting whatever you might I love that he says that because but that might not have hit your list but let me just put what a prophet said whatever you might lay upon it which is all right I believe in all of that too but unless your life oh I believe if we'd get back to what the for a prophet said we'd stop with the confusion of who's got it who don't have it what you got to get to get it let your life I say God let my life cope with my testimony unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells you what it is Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them sir now this young fellow's parents aha so to diagnose the ISS is he first goes to the Earthly lineage now here's his judges here's the cycle his he says not to the parents his mother's a German I hope you're not German today no reflection on the German but there's a strain in that family that is they'll just sit you could talk to them they'll just stare you right in the face got a lot of people in church like that sometimes don't we brother it's the reason God told Jeremiah don't look at their face preachers look over people sometimes you you got up here one time you'd know why oh yes they'll just sit there and stare at you brother bandam says right in the face the girl sister the mother this boy or sister I come down Street many morning young lady be sitting out the yard I'd say good morning to you she'd just look at me and I'd stoping I'd say sure a fine morning she'd stand look right at you an intelligent woman I'd say come up and see us she'd just stand and look well her brothers are that way father and mothers that way now the father of the boy so he stops with the mother mom now the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman I hope you're not Irish Moody High tempered High Strung yeah that's his whole family it's like that how did brother Brandon know because this is his nephew and he's talking about his own Brandon family they're high strung they're Moody they're temperamental that's his whole familyes like that what is that brother Matt that's his entire Book of Judges good things but he's a good brother he is she's a good sister she loves the Lord she is and she can be and she may never realize she's never broken from that judge's cycle come on very good and he says the father mother notice his whole family's like that except one or the other out of the family converted oh yeah now in this boy inside of him the prophet of God tells us in greatest battle ever fought you are not who you are who you see in the mirror listen you might see me you might hear me preach but you may not know me at all you know who knows me I know me and God knows who I really am and people you can see one thing on the outside and think you know them like a book on and then find out a year later my goodness how could they have done that problem is you never really seen who they really are Prophet said because you're not who you see in the mirror in fact brother bham tells us an angel the visitation of an Angel brother the prophet of God said he said that did you know that you've actually never seen who you really are he said in fact none of us have ever actually seen us CU who we really are is not this it's that c Jean Zoey life on the back part of God's mind you say brother Matt why you happy because this doesn't always look like this and I'm glad to know that this ain't who I really am you say who are you really brother Matt I'm that seed who feeds on the word who says Amen to the word who says yes Lord change me I Repent oh God that's who you really are in this boy father and mother brother brother says now in this boy the father and mother both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord now the young man is about 17 18 something along there verifying kid has been a real model boy at home now nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girl the brother the mother's family lives close to a fine church do you ever think they'd ever come over there oh they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness right you say brother mat you mean that after you're born of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about a gift of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about just being justified in your in your mind and intellectually you know the word you mean brother Matt when a person's really truly born of the spirit of God has the token living which brother bam said the token is the Holy Ghost when they're sealed by the Holy Ghost do you mean to tell me brother Matt that after that moment that the Holy Ghost work is not finished in them yeah that's right good come on you mean there's more that the Holy Ghost wants to do besides change your Soul's position that's good but I'm sealed with the Holy Ghost I'm going yeah means I got a ticket to the Rapture that's right but you mean that the Holy Ghost still has something more he wants to not just affect my soul you mean he wants to get into my personality traits you mean he wants to change the but that's my family that's just who we are that's just how my daddy was and that's just how I that's just the way I see things you're caught in judges you say the Holy Ghost wants to move into my human spirit and get in my memory my conscience my reasoning imagination affection he wants to change that part even of Me no brother he wants to go further in fact he wants to change your body he wants to change every part of you listen a lot of people stop with the baptism all ghost that's only the beginning of the work now God wants to work as a brother prophet of God said as The Headstone nears the body those in the body will be so much like the word till they're in his very image sir wonderful and so God wanted to get further into this man's heart yes notice this the girl mother's family you ever think they come to church ask forgiveness ask pardon they just won't do it it's just not in them now the jeans in this father the mother of this boy no matter how much he's talking about the mom and the dad who's been born again the father the mother the jeans and the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains In the Flesh that's been inbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got accomplish just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where the boy stands and if he dies there he'll die with the judges come on that's where he stands baptized Christian believer name amongst the church but never been really born of the spirit of God I said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up I said look at you out of your family all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there won't speak very independent so forth irr irreverent to religion but I said it's I love this part so much oh yeah but I said it's not you thank you Lord thank you Lord you're sweet you're the only one out of all your sisters and brothers and you're sweet you're kind you're forgiving what does that and your part your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore come it's your Christ yes sir that lives in you it's not your people oh my brother my sister until you can say it's not my family it's not my dad might have been good and I'm thankful for a good dad but you've got to break out of that Earthly book and you've got to step into an eternal book and say God let me die to myself let me die to my passion let me die to my pride oh as the prophet said take your pride and stomp it under your feet take that temper and hold it before the Holy Ghost I don't care what it is today say God let me be able to say it's not my people it's my Christ I said to the boy look at your family all drunks how Moody High tempered High strong but you're not you're kind you're forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you're no more what you are it's Christ in and the same thing has to happen to your son brother Brandon says father raised up said my son went to an altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus and water baptism the pool said I know my son has come to Christ I said that may it be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he's regenerated born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving I just raise my hand and say Yes Lord how many wanted to say Lord yes until let that gentle let that sweet let that forgiving Spirit of Christ come in all right then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it and when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God do you know the first thing it's recorded as I close in Hezekiah you say brother Matt did Kings in that way no there was another boy and the Bible says that and it came to pass in the third year of hosia son of elah Hezekiah the son of ahaz begin to rain 25 years old was it begin to rain and he reigned 29 years his mother's name was Abby the daughter of Zachariah and he did that which was right praise the Lord according to all that David do you realize David was not his father he was not his Earthly lineage but what happened he broke the link of his Earthly father and he was connected and what's the first thing he did in the next slide he removed the high places in other words he said it doesn't matter what my daddy did or my mother did or the church Down the Road God says he ever who's in Christ is a new creature oh Hallelujah I say God make me new my might my mind my spirit change me oh God could you stand to your feet and say Yes Lord yes God change my nature Lord sir change the very nature of a boy byow your heads with me born of the world born of the grab bag of Life Born With The Temptations and test and issues let me just say your story doesn't have to end in judges your story doesn't have to end there did you know that actually the entire story of Ruth the whole thing everything we can preach to you about the entire story of Ruth takes place you go read theit the end of Judges it's a terrible story ends in Murder ends with a tribe an entire tribe of Jacob's sons almost wiped out it ends with idolatry chaos like the rest of the world but did you know the story of Ruth takes place three miles just three miles from the way judges ends she enters at the beginning of barley harvest the little land of Bethlehem Judea you see you say brother M what are you saying what I'm trying to say with every bit of my heart is that the a different atmosphere for your home for your marriage for your mind a different life is only 3 miles away just right down the road thank it's not way a far far far far far way down somewhere you don't have to go very far and there's an entire different story taking place some people spend years years years in that cycle going around around and around and around and around doesn't matter your age doesn't matter how far you've came say brother Matt but you don't know how distant I am you don't know how far away I am from the Lord you don't know how you don't you don't know what's happened oh as as brother Brandon deals with that little sister in that prayer line and she's so tore up over her life and she's there just so tore up cuz she knew she was so far away from the Lord she knew that in her heart in her real True Heart of hers that that mask she had on was just a mask and her heart was so far that passion that Zeal that fervency the prophet of God you could hear quivering her voice quivering shaking there and oh brother Bram oh I'm so I'm so far away I've left the Lord and brother bham just says he says sister you do you want to be back yes brother brandham oh you could hear it in her voice yes I want to do you want to come sister you're saying you You' Fallen away from the Lord yes brother BR she's so torn up why cuz in her mind it seems so much bigger than it was in her mind sometimes like us we disconnect the Holy Spirit and Reconciliation and forgiveness and New Hope and New Life and we let the devil complicated us complicated and it seems so unreachable and you hear the prophet of God in that tape he says sister do you want to be back she says yes brother bam and you're God's Prophet to say you're back you're back come on in other words it's not far away you say What's it waiting on brother mat just a simple heart just a heart that'll say God I Repent I turn away from it I change I want to change God start with me Lord Jesus start with me start with a desire Lord God and change me from the very makeup and nature of who I am let me break forth from that judge's cycle and let me step into another story Lord Jesus Oh yes Father I'm so grateful I rais my hands Lord where would I have been oh God I'm sure every person here could survey their own life and say where where where would I be if it was not for Christ where would I be if Mercy didn't rewrite my life where would I have ended up what would my story be but Grace Grace thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord for Grace thank you God that you can take the most messed up wrapped up torn up even that little girl as brother Brandon deals with her and and from that time and he says she's lost her mind he was in Flynn of Michigan and he's dealing with patience and and people are crawling off the walls and banging their head against concrete there's that little girl brother Adam looks at her and says oh sis so overwhelming he says I don't even hardly know where to start that little girl raises and says sir I wish you would start with me oh friends I wonder if we could have that kind of honesty just to raise our hand and say God I wish you'd start with me Lord not my brother not my sister not the pastor not the preachers to start right here Lord don't try to fix everybody else's problems and and and miss that God's trying to speak to you start with me Lord start with my life yes Lord that's my prayer Lord Jesus I pray oh God as I preach this sermon I just raise my hand and say start with me Holy Spirit start with me oh God start purging my channels Purge my memory my conscience my reason and imaginations affections any thought that's contrary to the word of God anything that displeases the Holy Spirit anything that would grieve him from my life Lord anything that would put me Lord God out of the blessing and put me into the curse and anything that would withhold the water supply oh God I just want to say at this
