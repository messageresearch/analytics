[51:16] in jesus name
[51:18] amen
[51:20] amen hebrews chapter 11
[51:23] we'll read verses one through five
[51:26] actually through verse six
[51:32] excuse me for being a baby this morning
[51:34] i just love the presence of the lord
[51:37] amen i hope we all do i
[51:40] we don't all show it in the same way but
[51:42] there's just something about the
[51:44] presence
[51:45] of the lord and
[51:46] we want to always be in his presence
[51:49] hebrews 11 1 now faith
[51:52] is the substance of things hoped for
[51:55] the evidence of things not seen
[51:58] for by it the elders obtained a good
[52:01] report
[52:03] through faith we understand that the
[52:05] worlds were framed by the word of god
[52:08] so that things which are seen were not
[52:10] made of things which do appear
[52:12] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[52:15] excellent sacrifice than cain by which
[52:18] he obtained witness that he was
[52:20] righteous
[52:21] god testifying of his gifts
[52:24] and by it he being dead
[52:26] yet speaketh
[52:28] by faith enoch was translated that he
[52:30] should not see death and was not found
[52:33] because god had translated him for
[52:35] before his test his translation he had
[52:38] this testimony that he pleased god
[52:42] but without faith it is impossible to
[52:44] please him
[52:45] for he that cometh to god must believe
[52:48] that he is
[52:49] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[52:52] diligently
[52:53] seek him i pray the lord would add his
[52:55] blessing to the word you may be seated
[52:59] this morning
[53:03] how many of you have ever seen an impala
[53:05] in a zoo i don't mean the car
[53:08] but an impala in a zoo it's like a deer
[53:11] it's got two antlers
[53:13] you've seen an impala you little ones
[53:15] have seen
[53:16] an impala
[53:18] have you ever wondered why they don't
[53:19] just jump the fence
[53:22] some of these zoos have three foot
[53:24] fences
[53:25] and impalas can jump 10 feet high
[53:30] and jump for a distance of 30 feet
[53:34] now think about that for a minute and
[53:36] they can keep him behind a three foot
[53:38] wall
[53:39] and i've wondered about that and i think
[53:41] i've mentioned it to you before but it
[53:43] just it's always amazing to me that they
[53:46] can keep them behind that wall but the
[53:47] truth is the impala
[53:49] will not jump
[53:51] unless they can see
[53:53] where their feet are going to land so
[53:56] they have to be able to see it and that
[53:58] three foot wall is enough to obstruct
[54:00] their vision where they don't have
[54:02] confidence that when they land that
[54:04] they'll actually have a stable footing
[54:07] and so they don't jump
[54:09] now that's very much like what faith is
[54:11] to the christian
[54:13] this morning because faith is the sense
[54:16] that tells us where our feet will fall
[54:19] though we can't see it
[54:21] though we can't feel it
[54:23] though we can't touch it right though
[54:26] though we can't smell it or we can't
[54:27] contact him by the five senses yet we
[54:30] know
[54:32] it's not a supposition it's not a theory
[54:35] it's not thinking that maybe it happens
[54:38] but it's an understanding it's a
[54:40] knowledge it's a it's a reality it's a
[54:42] revelation brother joe that my feet will
[54:45] fall on firm ground if i jump into the
[54:48] promises of god so it tells us if we
[54:51] take the leap if we jump that's what i
[54:53] want us to do this morning as we talk
[54:55] once again about contacting our heavenly
[54:58] home i want us to take that leap of
[55:00] faith and jump into the promises of god
[55:03] don't be afraid don't step back don't
[55:05] don't walk away from it but come right
[55:07] up to it be a real christian don't don't
[55:10] be afraid to be a christian don't be
[55:11] afraid what people might say but take
[55:13] that leap of faith because you really
[55:15] know
[55:16] you know god will take care of you how
[55:18] many know that this morning god will
[55:20] take care of me on the other side i'm
[55:22] going to go to church because god will
[55:24] take care of me i'm going to live for
[55:26] god because god will take care of me i'm
[55:28] going to believe for my healing because
[55:30] he'll take care of me
[55:32] i know my feet will fall in a firm place
[55:36] in a solid place
[55:37] because god said so
[55:40] that's faith yes
[55:42] you know it
[55:43] you don't think it you know it
[55:46] amen and before maybe you were a
[55:48] christian you you thought well maybe god
[55:50] will help me maybe god will save me
[55:52] maybe god but once you have faith
[55:55] you know he'll help you
[55:57] you know he saved you yes sir you know
[56:00] what he's done in your life
[56:01] and it gives you confidence to say lord
[56:04] i believe not only what you have done
[56:06] but what you're going to do for me
[56:08] i see a future not just a past i'm not
[56:10] bound to the pastor but i have a future
[56:13] oh aren't you glad for that today
[56:15] that's what faith is
[56:17] so now
[56:18] last week we learned that there's five
[56:20] senses of the natural body
[56:22] and there's five senses of the spirit
[56:24] realm and you can go back and watch that
[56:26] or listen to brother branham speak about
[56:28] that in in different sermons that he
[56:30] preached now uh then faith he said it's
[56:33] the sixth sense and i want to dwell on
[56:35] that today it's that sixth sense now
[56:38] we talked about how god uses the sense
[56:40] of hearing to increase faith faith comes
[56:43] by hearing
[56:44] which is a sense of the body one of the
[56:46] five senses but god uses that so
[56:49] we don't reject all hearing but we
[56:52] reject any word that doesn't come from
[56:54] god
[56:55] right we don't reject all feeling
[56:58] right but we reject any feeling that
[57:00] doesn't come from god
[57:02] we don't reject all
[57:04] all of all of our senses but we reject
[57:06] those senses that do not line up with
[57:09] the word only we reject all those senses
[57:12] that are contrary to the word now when
[57:14] brother branham preaches a message
[57:16] called faith is the sixth sense he comes
[57:18] out and tells us right off the bat he
[57:20] said faith is a sense of deliverance
[57:24] it's a sense of deliverance
[57:26] he said it delivers us
[57:28] and rescues rescues from our five senses
[57:32] i love the way he puts this that we were
[57:35] put in in the beginning so he said it
[57:37] actually rescues us
[57:39] from our five senses now have you ever
[57:42] noticed that as a child and many times
[57:44] these children up here
[57:46] sometimes they're easier to preach to
[57:47] because they believe what you tell them
[57:50] right children believe
[57:53] adults have learned to disbelieve
[57:56] now think about we learn unbelief
[58:00] and i want us to understand that today
[58:01] because you have to be careful what you
[58:03] listen to
[58:04] because you learn unbelief
[58:07] you learn to just oh god's not going to
[58:09] take care of me you learn that
[58:12] everything's going to everything i'm
[58:13] going to lose everything everything's
[58:15] going to go wrong and
[58:17] and i'm going to get sick and i'm going
[58:18] to die well you might die you might get
[58:20] sick and die but god's got it god's
[58:22] going to take care of you
[58:24] right are you with me and so but you
[58:26] learn that unbelief
[58:28] you learn it from things you go through
[58:30] you learn it from the feeling that you
[58:31] have in your body you learn it from
[58:34] things you hear but children in most
[58:36] cases especially when they're very very
[58:38] young they haven't learned to disbelieve
[58:40] that's why they'll they'll jump off of a
[58:41] wall right into your arms but it's a
[58:43] little bit harder to get an adult to do
[58:45] that
[58:47] right because they've learned unbelief
[58:50] that's right and so now when it comes to
[58:52] spiritual things that faith actually our
[58:55] our sick sense rescues us from what
[58:58] we've learned it delivers us from what
[59:00] we've learned it delivers us from ideas
[59:02] and creeds of men that cause unbelief to
[59:05] come in our life so denomination teaches
[59:08] that now what they do is they teach
[59:10] through creeds and dogmas they teach
[59:11] unbelief
[59:13] that's right they teach unbelief you say
[59:15] well how do they do that well they teach
[59:17] unbelief by putting the works of god in
[59:19] the past
[59:21] or in the future
[59:23] and saying that he's not the same
[59:24] yesterday today and forever
[59:27] right that's how they teach unbelief
[59:30] now and i'm going to show that to you
[59:31] this morning now
[59:32] it's why it's so important who we yield
[59:34] our sense of hearing to it's so
[59:36] important who we're listening to listen
[59:38] to second timothy chapter 2 and verse 15
[59:40] paul writing to timothy a young preacher
[59:43] he said study or work that word is to
[59:45] work or or to be diligent to show
[59:48] thyself approved unto god a workman that
[59:50] needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[59:53] dividing the word
[59:54] of truth don't just get up and spout off
[59:57] but have a basis for it and study for it
[1:00:00] and find out what god wants you to say
[1:00:02] and then he said but shun profane and
[1:00:06] vain babblings i won't make you show a
[1:00:09] show of hands but you've heard some vain
[1:00:11] babblings i'm sure
[1:00:12] i've heard some it was a lot of words
[1:00:15] but it didn't mean anything
[1:00:17] and sometimes we preachers get good at
[1:00:19] that
[1:00:20] word salad is what they call it our
[1:00:22] current vice president is very good at
[1:00:24] it
[1:00:26] and
[1:00:27] and so they just say a bunch of words
[1:00:28] but it doesn't politicians get good at
[1:00:30] it say about your words but they don't
[1:00:32] mean anything paul said shun that as a
[1:00:34] minister shun that and i think his
[1:00:36] hearers as well we should shun that we
[1:00:39] don't want to listen to just a bunch of
[1:00:41] words
[1:00:43] right that don't mean anything it's not
[1:00:45] the
[1:00:45] how many words you say you don't get a
[1:00:47] reward regardless of what you might what
[1:00:49] you might think you don't get a bigger
[1:00:51] crown in heaven because you used more
[1:00:53] words while you were preaching
[1:00:57] right but it's what you say
[1:01:00] not how many words he said shun profane
[1:01:03] and vain babbling for they will increase
[1:01:05] unto more ungodliness because you
[1:01:07] confuse people
[1:01:09] and there were now watch second timothy
[1:01:11] 2 17 their word
[1:01:13] those that that go on like that
[1:01:15] saying things that aren't in the
[1:01:16] scripture that aren't true or or that
[1:01:18] are just
[1:01:19] irrelevant
[1:01:20] their word will eat as that's a canker
[1:01:23] and that's something that gets in your
[1:01:25] body and then it causes gangrene
[1:01:28] when it says it'll eat it'll spread
[1:01:29] through the body
[1:01:31] their word will eat as does a canker
[1:01:34] and paul gets pretty serious he names
[1:01:36] names of whom is hymenius and philetus
[1:01:39] who concerning the truth have aired
[1:01:42] saying that the resurrection has passed
[1:01:44] already now watch how they aired
[1:01:47] they said the resurrection is past
[1:01:50] so you've got no hope to look forward to
[1:01:53] oh my
[1:01:54] you see what doctrine makes a difference
[1:01:57] it matters what you hear it matters what
[1:01:59] you believe
[1:02:00] it said the resurrection is past and
[1:02:02] when in doing so they overthrow what do
[1:02:04] they overthrow the faith yes
[1:02:08] right and that's why we got to watch
[1:02:10] what we listen to that's why we gather
[1:02:12] together here and we don't just all go
[1:02:13] we could all go
[1:02:14] and still be christians pers we could
[1:02:16] say i could go to the baptist church
[1:02:18] with a joke you go to the methodist
[1:02:19] church and whether joel could go to the
[1:02:21] pentecostal church all of you could go
[1:02:22] to different churches and we we could be
[1:02:24] just fine probably but we would be
[1:02:26] hearing
[1:02:28] a word tainted by denominationalism
[1:02:30] right god help us that we'd never do
[1:02:32] that in the message of the hour
[1:02:34] but when we get our particular idea and
[1:02:37] that's what's so wrong about there's
[1:02:38] certain doctrines and you know me i i
[1:02:40] promote fellowship i believe we ought to
[1:02:42] get along i think if we're going to get
[1:02:44] along with over there we might as well
[1:02:46] get along over here
[1:02:47] but there are certain doctrines that you
[1:02:49] can hear certain things certain types of
[1:02:51] preaching that actually don't help you
[1:02:53] it actually causes you to disbelieve
[1:02:57] because it makes you wonder the bible
[1:02:59] puts it this way it ministers questions
[1:03:01] yes we didn't we're not called to
[1:03:03] minister questions
[1:03:05] god didn't make us apologetics that's
[1:03:07] not what he called us to do but to
[1:03:09] proclaim the gospel
[1:03:11] we're not to apologize for the gospel
[1:03:13] but to proclaim the gospel because the
[1:03:15] gospel is the power paul says of christ
[1:03:18] how many believe that today
[1:03:19] it's the power of christ
[1:03:22] amen now
[1:03:23] so he said they've erred because they
[1:03:25] said the resurrection is past
[1:03:27] and they overthrew the faith of some
[1:03:30] because there are some people in such a
[1:03:32] bad condition here in this life that
[1:03:34] their only hope is the resurrection
[1:03:37] now think about it as you get older and
[1:03:39] you get
[1:03:40] you begin to realize that you've got
[1:03:42] loved ones over there and they say oh
[1:03:44] it's a spiritual resurrection it's
[1:03:45] already passed and here's my loved one
[1:03:47] that went on to be with the lord and how
[1:03:49] do i have a hope of ever seeing them
[1:03:51] again
[1:03:52] unless there's a resurrection
[1:03:54] how do i have a hope of doing that see
[1:03:56] again the word matters and if you hear
[1:03:58] about the resurrection what does that do
[1:04:00] when i tell you you're going to see your
[1:04:02] loved ones when you hear it on a tape
[1:04:03] when you read your bible and you begin
[1:04:05] to read first corinthians 15 51 begin to
[1:04:08] read first thessalonians 4 what happens
[1:04:10] all of a sudden you begin to click with
[1:04:12] you and you say hey i'm going to see him
[1:04:14] again
[1:04:15] paul said don't sorrow like others who
[1:04:16] have no hope amen but be a believer
[1:04:20] hallelujah
[1:04:22] oh i it gives you faith the word gives
[1:04:25] you faith
[1:04:26] and that's why some people some families
[1:04:28] some churches
[1:04:29] some of us right here
[1:04:31] sometimes we lack faith because we're
[1:04:33] listening all the time to unbelief
[1:04:39] and but you have the ability now watch
[1:04:42] you might you might come in here but you
[1:04:43] have the ability
[1:04:45] to reject it
[1:04:47] to walk away from it
[1:04:49] to not hear it
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:52] so now watch
[1:04:55] let's go to the message again where
[1:04:56] brother brandon preached faith this the
[1:04:58] sixth sense he said notice
[1:04:59] that these senses was given to you
[1:05:02] to only contact your earthly home that
[1:05:05] you might see taste feel smell in here
[1:05:08] but they're by no means to lead you
[1:05:11] by no means to lead you and now many
[1:05:13] times he said what if i refuse to look
[1:05:15] anymore and i just bind up my eyes and
[1:05:18] say i refuse to look
[1:05:21] all right my eyes can't serve me no more
[1:05:24] well then finally i'll go blind
[1:05:27] and watch you say brother ben why i just
[1:05:29] can't seem to have the faith that i want
[1:05:30] to but i wonder sometimes if we haven't
[1:05:32] been blinded and don't realize it
[1:05:34] because we just haven't exercised our
[1:05:36] faith in the word
[1:05:38] he says finally i'll go blind he said
[1:05:40] and then when my bo my boy comes on now
[1:05:42] watch
[1:05:44] so first of all the man is blind because
[1:05:46] he refused to see
[1:05:48] there's no one so blind as the man who
[1:05:50] refuses to see
[1:05:52] right
[1:05:53] he said see the blind man naturally
[1:05:55] would see if he could
[1:05:57] but here's a man who refuses to see
[1:06:00] and so he said all right my eyes can't
[1:06:02] serve anymore finally i'll go blind
[1:06:04] because i haven't used my eyes
[1:06:07] and then when my boy comes on
[1:06:09] i'll tie his eyes up
[1:06:12] so watch i put a
[1:06:14] something over my eyes i can't see
[1:06:16] and then peter comes along and i teach
[1:06:18] him the same thing i was taught
[1:06:21] right you can't see either
[1:06:24] god don't do those things no more
[1:06:27] you see why it's so dangerous
[1:06:30] god help us today
[1:06:31] better watch what we listen to
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:34] because there will be
[1:06:36] if you're around long enough then i'm
[1:06:38] not old but i've been had a few miles
[1:06:40] and i've seen a lot i've seen a lot of
[1:06:42] people get into heresy and into uh into
[1:06:46] become over-emotional and and get into
[1:06:49] the things like the sign gifts and
[1:06:51] things like that to a point where they
[1:06:52] went completely off the word i've seen
[1:06:54] it i've seen them go too far
[1:06:57] but if you don't believe in the gifts at
[1:06:59] all yeah
[1:07:01] you cover your eyes yes all right
[1:07:04] if you don't believe in the moving of
[1:07:06] the spirit at all you're covering your
[1:07:08] eyes
[1:07:09] and you're teaching your children the
[1:07:10] same thing yes
[1:07:12] to cover their eyes up so that they
[1:07:14] can't see
[1:07:15] but i want to my children to be able to
[1:07:18] see the same things i see
[1:07:19] i see a god who still moves
[1:07:22] i see a god who still delivers yes sir
[1:07:24] what do you see this morning what do you
[1:07:27] see can you see a church that's still on
[1:07:29] fire for god if you can see it you can
[1:07:31] be it yes
[1:07:32] but if you can't see it you need to take
[1:07:34] the blinders off
[1:07:35] yes sir
[1:07:37] i see a church that can be on fire for
[1:07:39] god i see a people who close god with
[1:07:41] all of their heart i see regardless of
[1:07:43] the situation that's going on around me
[1:07:45] i see a future for you you say well i
[1:07:47] don't have much future i'm getting old
[1:07:49] but remember even though you're old
[1:07:51] there's a future for you because you
[1:07:52] have eternal life
[1:07:54] i see a future i see i see god moving in
[1:07:57] his bride you can tell me all day that
[1:07:58] the bride has failed but i see a word
[1:08:00] that says this bride would not fall yes
[1:08:03] sir what am i supposed to believe i'm
[1:08:05] supposed to look with spiritual eyes so
[1:08:07] i don't bind the eyes of my children
[1:08:11] are you hearing me today
[1:08:12] it's important that we see
[1:08:16] because whatever condition
[1:08:18] that we're in our kids will be that plus
[1:08:23] well that ought to sober us up huh
[1:08:27] if you get where you can't see this
[1:08:29] morning by faith you just can't see
[1:08:32] you put a blind over your kid's eyes
[1:08:35] you say well i just can't do it well i
[1:08:38] can do all things through christ who
[1:08:40] strengthens me
[1:08:43] now watch he said finally i'll go blind
[1:08:45] when my boy comes on i'll tie his eyes
[1:08:47] up and say no sir there's no such thing
[1:08:49] as sight i'll just tie his eyes up don't
[1:08:52] let him see
[1:08:56] well i could get in deep here but i
[1:08:58] think you can apply it spiritually
[1:09:00] look don't let him see
[1:09:02] don't don't go down there don't don't
[1:09:04] don't don't fellowship with those people
[1:09:06] because they might try to take that off
[1:09:07] your eyes
[1:09:09] by the preaching of the word
[1:09:11] he said no so there's no such thing as
[1:09:13] sight i'll tie his eyes up don't let him
[1:09:14] see he said my father told me there was
[1:09:16] no such thing as sight yeah
[1:09:19] now watch
[1:09:20] so now it's in the third generation
[1:09:24] my father told me there was no such
[1:09:25] thing as sight so i'll tie up my boy's
[1:09:27] eyes
[1:09:29] oh god he said well the first thing you
[1:09:31] know
[1:09:32] our generation would be born blind
[1:09:36] he said that's right if you don't use
[1:09:38] your six senses they become dormant
[1:09:41] they won't act
[1:09:43] at all yeah
[1:09:44] he said brother that's what the church
[1:09:46] has done to the sixth sense god put him
[1:09:49] in
[1:09:50] he just placed faith off now watch in
[1:09:52] miracles and signs in other words only a
[1:09:55] an apostle only a prophet can do that
[1:09:57] only only people like that and it's only
[1:09:59] a special time a special place and only
[1:10:01] for a pastime or a future time he puts
[1:10:04] faith off in miracles and science he
[1:10:06] said in the things that contacts god
[1:10:08] yeah oh god now see i'm not a prophet
[1:10:11] and if i put all of my faith in just
[1:10:13] being able to discern the secret of the
[1:10:15] heart
[1:10:16] you understand that god showed us a sign
[1:10:18] in our day
[1:10:19] to discern the secret lord but if i put
[1:10:21] all of my faith in that then i have no
[1:10:23] faith in what god gave me which is lay
[1:10:25] hands on the sick yes
[1:10:27] right call for the elders of the church
[1:10:28] anoint him with all that and they'll be
[1:10:30] we should have faith in that
[1:10:32] and if you watch brother branham and
[1:10:33] perfect faith he's trying to turn the
[1:10:35] people to that to where they can just
[1:10:36] believe when hands are laid on them
[1:10:39] and even when they don't see the sign
[1:10:41] and so we're living in that time we
[1:10:43] don't have brother branham here as a
[1:10:45] prophet and no one has replaced him
[1:10:47] right
[1:10:48] no one will ever replace him but we do
[1:10:50] have the same god
[1:10:53] do we believe that this morning if we
[1:10:55] have the same god he said then the
[1:10:57] things that contacts god
[1:11:00] gives him the holy ghost and things
[1:11:02] now watch he said he placed that off
[1:11:05] over there or back over there somewhere
[1:11:08] till the thing has become
[1:11:10] dead yes
[1:11:12] right oh god
[1:11:14] oh and i would say this to you i i think
[1:11:17] you you shouldn't listen to that right
[1:11:21] you shouldn't listen that don't
[1:11:23] if anybody has a right the way that i
[1:11:25] was raised and the way that things
[1:11:27] happen in our life and my family my
[1:11:28] sister is here this morning my brother
[1:11:30] here i'm thankful for my family but if
[1:11:32] anybody had a right to reject
[1:11:34] supernatural things it would be us
[1:11:36] because the way we were raised some of
[1:11:38] you come out of similar things
[1:11:40] and you might reject supernatural things
[1:11:42] because you think well so and so did it
[1:11:44] and they were a phony
[1:11:46] but god's word is still true
[1:11:49] so and so didn't live it but i can live
[1:11:51] it come on
[1:11:52] god put something in me to live it
[1:11:55] god put something in you to live it amen
[1:11:57] there will always be a false but the
[1:11:59] false does not make me reject the real
[1:12:01] it makes me look harder and search more
[1:12:04] diligently for the real yes sir
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:07] so now he said the the things that
[1:12:09] contact scotty he put him off somewhere
[1:12:11] over there the thing has become dead he
[1:12:13] said that's right he don't know how to
[1:12:14] use it and the thing's just nothing to
[1:12:16] him that's why you can come sit in a
[1:12:18] meeting you can be a part of a service
[1:12:20] you just sit there and think well
[1:12:21] everybody's being blessed and
[1:12:22] everybody's being helped and i just sit
[1:12:24] there and nothing i don't feel anything
[1:12:26] it's not that you have no potential for
[1:12:28] sight but you haven't used it in so long
[1:12:31] that you can't see when god's working
[1:12:33] oh i hope you're hearing me this morning
[1:12:35] many times god moves in our local
[1:12:37] services not just in a meeting many
[1:12:39] times the presence of god is so real
[1:12:41] that if you just reach out and grab a
[1:12:43] hold of what god god has for you you
[1:12:45] could be healed you could be saved you
[1:12:47] could be delivered do you believe that
[1:12:48] today
[1:12:49] many times in our own church service you
[1:12:51] could be delivered of the things that
[1:12:53] you have need you could get the things
[1:12:55] you have need of you can be delivered to
[1:12:56] the things that bind you if you would
[1:12:58] just believe
[1:13:00] but see we don't use our faith because
[1:13:03] of the time we're living in yeah and
[1:13:05] this why brother joel it makes it so
[1:13:07] easy to preach to people who have to use
[1:13:09] faith
[1:13:10] because they don't know that the
[1:13:11] donkey's gonna
[1:13:13] live through the night so they can get
[1:13:15] on it right in the morning
[1:13:18] so to say they don't know the car won't
[1:13:20] start but they don't
[1:13:21] some of them don't have cars
[1:13:23] and if you ever go to places like that
[1:13:25] and preach to people like that they're
[1:13:27] expecting god to do something that's
[1:13:29] right
[1:13:30] they're expecting god to move and if you
[1:13:32] can ever get them to understand faith
[1:13:35] then that's the hard part because they
[1:13:36] expect him to do it right then yeah
[1:13:38] right and if you're not careful then you
[1:13:40] teach them unbelief but you expect you
[1:13:41] tell them it's not about that but it's
[1:13:43] about it's about you believing and
[1:13:45] holding on
[1:13:46] and then one day those eyes are going to
[1:13:48] come open
[1:13:49] one day that that that sickness is going
[1:13:51] to leave your body because it's like
[1:13:53] abraham you have the faith and god's
[1:13:55] testing and trying you and putting you
[1:13:57] through a test so that he can you can
[1:13:58] come out on the other side so god can do
[1:14:00] great miracles but he's always a healer
[1:14:03] and so but if you talk to those kind of
[1:14:05] people if you talk to people that don't
[1:14:06] have nothing they're used to not having
[1:14:08] nothing they're used to having to get up
[1:14:10] every morning not knowing they don't
[1:14:11] have social security
[1:14:13] yeah
[1:14:14] they don't there's nobody to catch them
[1:14:18] you think about a nightmare apocalyptic
[1:14:20] scenario in this country i've preached
[1:14:22] to hundreds probably thousands of people
[1:14:25] over the years
[1:14:27] that are already in that situation
[1:14:30] overseas
[1:14:31] yeah they don't have nothing the
[1:14:33] situation we think of as an apocalypse
[1:14:36] they're in it
[1:14:38] they're living the squeeze yeah some of
[1:14:41] you that have traveled overseas you know
[1:14:42] what i'm talking about
[1:14:44] they're living it
[1:14:45] but that brother that come to brother
[1:14:46] paul and told him about the message of
[1:14:48] the hour
[1:14:50] that they come to him and witness christ
[1:14:51] to him that brother come to an oil rig
[1:14:53] they didn't howard they have shoes on
[1:14:55] his feet in west africa that man knew
[1:14:57] something about god knew something about
[1:14:59] faith are you hearing me today
[1:15:01] there's there's people out there and i'm
[1:15:03] not saying that to condemn you because
[1:15:04] i'm one of you right we're soft it's
[1:15:06] hard for us to do that we want to know
[1:15:08] everything we want to have everything
[1:15:09] put out and laid out in front of us but
[1:15:11] sometimes god wants you to just get away
[1:15:13] break away from that another so for us
[1:15:15] we have to exercise our faith we got to
[1:15:17] use it we got to put it in motion we got
[1:15:20] to say lord i don't care what the doctor
[1:15:22] says i don't care what the people say i
[1:15:24] don't care what anybody says i believe
[1:15:26] you lord yeah can we do that this
[1:15:28] morning i believe you lord
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:33] hallelujah
[1:15:35] now
[1:15:36] he said you don't know how to use it
[1:15:37] things just nothing to him you say well
[1:15:39] god's a healer oh what about that god's
[1:15:40] a healer
[1:15:42] he it just nothing to him
[1:15:44] but he said if he ever was a healer he's
[1:15:46] still a healer
[1:15:47] if he ever was a savior he's still a
[1:15:49] savior
[1:15:50] if he ever was god he's still god
[1:15:55] hold on i want you to watch this
[1:15:57] so you see he said it's a lack of faith
[1:16:01] that's been preached into
[1:16:04] the people
[1:16:07] oh god
[1:16:08] that makes them let that sick sense
[1:16:11] which is by faith
[1:16:12] lay dormant yes
[1:16:15] it's a lack of why not believe that we
[1:16:17] can
[1:16:18] now the truth is if you say we can't and
[1:16:21] i say we can the truth is what it is
[1:16:25] whether we can or we can't that is what
[1:16:27] it is but if you say we can't and we
[1:16:29] don't try
[1:16:32] right if you say it can't be done it
[1:16:34] means we won't try and if we don't try
[1:16:36] then we we're guaranteed failure
[1:16:40] so i would rather try if there was one
[1:16:42] millionth of one millionth of a chance
[1:16:44] of success
[1:16:46] especially when it comes to these
[1:16:47] important things but we have much more
[1:16:49] than that we have the word of god itself
[1:16:52] right which said i'm the god that heals
[1:16:54] all your diseases i'm the same yesterday
[1:16:56] today and forever he says those things
[1:16:58] and he tells us those things and so we
[1:17:00] have his word we ought to be able to
[1:17:02] take the leap of faith and believe it
[1:17:04] but the reason why people don't is that
[1:17:06] it's a lack of faith that's been
[1:17:08] preached
[1:17:09] into the people let's take an example of
[1:17:11] that in numbers chapter 13 and this is a
[1:17:13] very
[1:17:14] familiar story but i want to i'm kind of
[1:17:16] uh
[1:17:17] trying to get through this this morning
[1:17:18] without without wearing you out and
[1:17:21] brother joel's going to preach this
[1:17:22] afternoon he asked me not to announce
[1:17:24] that
[1:17:24] and i started not to because i was
[1:17:27] afraid to be more people and it make me
[1:17:29] feel bad if i announced he was because
[1:17:31] he was afraid of the opposite thing
[1:17:32] happening
[1:17:33] so you all proved come prove one of us
[1:17:35] wrong
[1:17:38] but numbers chapter 13 and verse 26
[1:17:41] talks about
[1:17:42] about uh israel when they come to kedish
[1:17:45] barnea and moses sends out the ten spies
[1:17:47] now notice they were sent by moses
[1:17:49] hand-picked
[1:17:51] to do the job
[1:17:53] say well i
[1:17:54] the prophet ordained me moses ordained
[1:17:57] all 12 spies
[1:18:02] right he ordained all of them because it
[1:18:04] was the purpose of god you see why some
[1:18:06] of these people could hang so close to a
[1:18:08] prophet and then come off and be wrong
[1:18:10] in the end you say how could that
[1:18:11] possibly be god ordained it to be that
[1:18:13] way that's right
[1:18:14] right you ordained these men now watch
[1:18:16] they went and came to moses and to aaron
[1:18:18] and all the congregation of the children
[1:18:19] of israel and to the wilderness apparent
[1:18:21] to kadesh and brought back word unto
[1:18:24] them and unto all the congregation and
[1:18:26] showed them the fruit
[1:18:28] of the land
[1:18:30] and they told him and said we came unto
[1:18:32] the land whither thou sinnest us
[1:18:35] and they had to acknowledge now that the
[1:18:36] word was true and surely it floweth with
[1:18:40] milk and honey
[1:18:42] and this is the fruit of it
[1:18:45] what was that fruit it was a bunch of
[1:18:47] grapes
[1:18:48] and they brought back the pomegranates
[1:18:50] and different things but they had a
[1:18:50] bunch of grapes it was so large
[1:18:53] it had to be carried on a staff between
[1:18:56] two men
[1:18:57] i don't know if you've been to walmart
[1:18:59] lately
[1:19:00] but you don't get grapes like that at
[1:19:02] walmart
[1:19:04] it'd take all the grapes and all the
[1:19:06] boxes up here at the ash flat walmart to
[1:19:08] get enough grapes so that you'd have to
[1:19:10] carry them like that
[1:19:11] right but here comes here comes two men
[1:19:14] walking in a staggering into the camp
[1:19:16] under the influence of these grapes
[1:19:21] right and and they're they're coming oh
[1:19:23] it's a good land it's flowing with milk
[1:19:25] and honey yes
[1:19:27] but
[1:19:30] nevertheless
[1:19:32] the people be strong
[1:19:34] well they ought to be strong with eating
[1:19:35] them kind of grapes
[1:19:40] maybe we should eat some of what they're
[1:19:41] eating
[1:19:45] nevertheless the people be strong that
[1:19:47] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:19:49] walled
[1:19:50] oh my
[1:19:52] and very great and moreover we saw the
[1:19:55] children of anak there we saw the
[1:19:57] children of anac oh my that ought to put
[1:19:59] some fear in them because they'd heard
[1:20:00] the children of anak were
[1:20:03] the amalekites as well in the land of
[1:20:05] the south
[1:20:06] and the hittites and the jebusites
[1:20:08] and the methodists and the baptists
[1:20:10] dwell in the mountains
[1:20:12] and the pentecostals dwell by the sea
[1:20:15] don't want to be like them pentecostals
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:18] the coast of jordan
[1:20:22] bring it up to today
[1:20:24] and caleb i love this
[1:20:26] what happened to caleb why was he
[1:20:27] different well number one he had faith
[1:20:30] he believed god he was god's chosen but
[1:20:32] i believe that when he was in the land
[1:20:34] he'd taken advantage not only he did he
[1:20:36] carry the grapes but he ate some of them
[1:20:40] amen brother brandon said when you've
[1:20:41] been eating grapes he said you can tell
[1:20:43] it yeah you said get grape seeds in your
[1:20:45] teeth you
[1:20:46] you get slobbers all over your face why
[1:20:48] you've been eating grapes and caleb was
[1:20:50] stimulated
[1:20:52] oh my by the revelation that they could
[1:20:55] do it
[1:20:56] and caleb got all the people quiet he
[1:20:58] said let us go up at once
[1:21:01] and possess it for we are well able to
[1:21:03] overcome it
[1:21:04] but the men that went up with him said
[1:21:06] we'd be not able to go up against the
[1:21:08] people for they are stronger than we
[1:21:11] they were not wrong about that
[1:21:14] what the only thing they got wrong was
[1:21:16] the promise
[1:21:18] i want you to hear me today when you
[1:21:19] hear this type of preaching or this type
[1:21:22] of ministry or maybe from the news or or
[1:21:24] from your family from somebody else well
[1:21:26] we're not able we're not we're not able
[1:21:28] you can't live like that today you'll be
[1:21:29] called an amish person you'll be you'll
[1:21:31] be some kind of an outcast you you can't
[1:21:33] live like that you can't be like that
[1:21:35] when you hear that remember they got
[1:21:37] everything right
[1:21:40] except for the promise
[1:21:42] you will be persecuted but you have a
[1:21:44] promise
[1:21:46] you will be laughed at but you have a
[1:21:48] promise come on there will be sickness
[1:21:50] there will be trouble there will be
[1:21:52] struggles there will be people who are
[1:21:54] false there will be false signs and
[1:21:56] sensations everything else but there is
[1:21:58] a promise
[1:21:59] that you can have the real thing yes
[1:22:02] are you hearing me today
[1:22:04] don't let the
[1:22:06] the
[1:22:07] hearing about the failure
[1:22:09] keep you from the promise
[1:22:11] hearing about the problems
[1:22:14] keep you from what god promised to do
[1:22:17] so it says they brought up an evil
[1:22:19] report of the land
[1:22:21] which they had searched unto the
[1:22:23] children of israel saying the land
[1:22:25] through which we have gone to search it
[1:22:27] i said bless god we're
[1:22:29] doctors of divinity
[1:22:32] and we have our bibles
[1:22:34] we have our quotes
[1:22:37] right
[1:22:38] they've gone up through the land to
[1:22:39] search it
[1:22:41] they're not they're not
[1:22:43] unknowledgeable people that's not a word
[1:22:45] is it
[1:22:45] they're not ignorant people
[1:22:48] here's what i was looking for
[1:22:49] these are not ignorant people they've
[1:22:52] went down through the land and looked
[1:22:55] and examined it
[1:22:56] sit walls are too big but you see what
[1:22:58] you want to see
[1:23:00] see caleb was looking through
[1:23:01] rose-colored glasses they could accuse
[1:23:03] him of that and be right you could
[1:23:04] accuse me of that and be correct
[1:23:07] brother ben you just don't see the
[1:23:08] problems brother ben if you were a
[1:23:09] little bit older if you had a little
[1:23:11] gray hair if you you'd understand
[1:23:12] there's problems out here there's
[1:23:13] trouble there's situations but there's a
[1:23:18] promise haven't oh god i haven't had it
[1:23:22] preached out of me yet yeah
[1:23:24] i still i still could see maybe not as
[1:23:27] strong as some of you might be able to
[1:23:28] see but i can still see can you see this
[1:23:30] morning can you see that the land is
[1:23:32] flowing with milk and honey
[1:23:34] but these these learned men these great
[1:23:36] men walked through the land and said
[1:23:39] it's just not able
[1:23:41] we can't do it oh i see where paul did
[1:23:43] it
[1:23:43] i see where brother branham did it
[1:23:46] but for us it's too much we might as
[1:23:48] well just sit down and wait for the
[1:23:49] coming of the lord
[1:23:51] it's too much for us to expect our
[1:23:53] children to be on fire for god
[1:23:55] it's too much for us to expect our
[1:23:57] families to live holy lives
[1:23:59] too much for us to expect our children
[1:24:01] to obey
[1:24:03] boy got quiet
[1:24:07] but isn't that what said today is too
[1:24:09] much
[1:24:10] oh you'll be too hard on your kids if
[1:24:12] you spank them what does the word say
[1:24:16] the word says spare the rods full of the
[1:24:18] child
[1:24:19] you can even tell me all day long what
[1:24:21] the psychologist says but the word says
[1:24:24] and the word never changed that that's
[1:24:26] right and the prophet updated it to our
[1:24:27] day and showed us how we wouldn't do
[1:24:29] that in anger and all of those things
[1:24:30] but it still has to be done
[1:24:33] right there's a promise
[1:24:34] that if we if we guide them in the right
[1:24:36] way when they're old
[1:24:39] it doesn't say how but when they're old
[1:24:41] they will not depart from it oh isn't
[1:24:43] that a comfort to some of you whose
[1:24:44] children may be astrayed at times but
[1:24:47] you see they come back what do they come
[1:24:48] back to they come back to the word
[1:24:52] amen give them something to come back to
[1:24:55] that's what's wrong with this culture
[1:24:56] today every time the world moves to
[1:24:58] church moves
[1:25:00] every time the world gets a little more
[1:25:01] worldly the church just moves over to it
[1:25:03] but that's not what we're called to do
[1:25:05] we're not called to be with the culture
[1:25:07] we're called to be with the word
[1:25:09] every time the world moves we just get
[1:25:10] closer to god yes sir that's what we're
[1:25:13] called to do yes
[1:25:14] the culture's gonna move right i've been
[1:25:17] hearing some strange reports out of the
[1:25:19] schools
[1:25:20] and we're gonna pray earnestly with our
[1:25:22] children this year
[1:25:23] here at the church before school starts
[1:25:25] i believe it starts here on the 15th
[1:25:27] we'll try to do it that sunday some may
[1:25:28] have already started
[1:25:30] but
[1:25:30] you know we want to pray earnestly with
[1:25:32] our children because i've been hearing
[1:25:34] some reports that are pretty bad
[1:25:36] and some awful things that are coming in
[1:25:38] the land that we're in and some adults
[1:25:41] that don't have any sense
[1:25:44] but it seems like our children would
[1:25:45] even be swallowed up by it yeah and we
[1:25:48] want to make the best decisions as
[1:25:50] parents about what we're going to do and
[1:25:51] where we're going to send them and what
[1:25:53] we're going to do and all of those
[1:25:54] things and
[1:25:55] and yet make sure that they get an
[1:25:56] education where they can have a job and
[1:25:59] be able to work and do those things and
[1:26:00] it's important
[1:26:02] it's important to do those things but
[1:26:03] yet but as parents you have to make
[1:26:05] those decisions i can't do that for you
[1:26:07] but you look out at the report that's
[1:26:09] going on and you say well what are we
[1:26:11] going to do we just going to become more
[1:26:12] like it more like what where they don't
[1:26:15] understand which gender they are yeah
[1:26:17] where they don't understand what species
[1:26:19] they are
[1:26:21] we're going to become more like that
[1:26:24] i'm telling you the gap between us and
[1:26:26] the canaanites
[1:26:28] it's going to be so wide
[1:26:31] oh god
[1:26:33] it's going to be so wide that it's going
[1:26:34] to seem like the only way you can't beat
[1:26:36] them might as well join them but you've
[1:26:38] got to believe that you can overcome
[1:26:41] that there will be a bride if you don't
[1:26:43] believe it you'll never do it
[1:26:46] why would you teach your children
[1:26:48] correctly if you don't really believe
[1:26:49] that's the problem it all boils down to
[1:26:51] a lack of faith yeah why would you teach
[1:26:54] your children the right way why teach
[1:26:55] your children to wear skirts and and
[1:26:57] wear decent clothing and well i teach
[1:26:59] your boys not to cuss not to be on video
[1:27:02] games all day and do those things i
[1:27:03] teach them right yeah
[1:27:06] if you don't believe it'll help them
[1:27:09] but if you believe
[1:27:11] that there is a better way how many
[1:27:12] believe you this morning if you believe
[1:27:14] there's a god who still answers prayer
[1:27:17] if you believe there can still be a
[1:27:18] church on fire for god i'm not telling
[1:27:20] you to be some kind of homicide i'm
[1:27:22] telling you stay with the word
[1:27:24] stay with the word
[1:27:26] stay with what god said if you believe
[1:27:28] it you can have it he said but you don't
[1:27:30] know what my past has been if you
[1:27:32] believe it you can have it today
[1:27:34] if you oh my
[1:27:36] i hope you believe it today i don't care
[1:27:38] what your past has been i don't care how
[1:27:39] many times you failed i don't care where
[1:27:41] you've been you may have been in some
[1:27:43] awful places but i come i come from a
[1:27:45] broken a broken background in my own
[1:27:47] psyche my own spirit i come from a
[1:27:50] broken spirit but that's what god works
[1:27:52] through he works through a broken spirit
[1:27:54] and a broken heart i've seen god take
[1:27:56] men that were on drugs and alcohol and
[1:27:58] everything else turn around make them
[1:27:59] preachers why would god use a man like
[1:28:01] that why would he use a man like that
[1:28:03] because he wants to show he's still god
[1:28:07] if he could do it for them he could do
[1:28:08] it for you
[1:28:10] i'm convinced that if god could save me
[1:28:11] he could save anybody
[1:28:16] well i never thought about myself that
[1:28:18] way brother ben you'd probably need to
[1:28:19] yeah
[1:28:22] paul said i was the chiefest of sinners
[1:28:24] he had a religious spirit that's the
[1:28:25] worst one yeah
[1:28:30] yeah oh god
[1:28:32] he said look we've gone to search it
[1:28:34] we're we're learning men we know the
[1:28:36] message
[1:28:38] i don't even know where i'm at but
[1:28:39] you'll
[1:28:40] hang with me this morning
[1:28:42] look
[1:28:44] the land we've searched it out
[1:28:46] the land eats up the inhabitants thereof
[1:28:50] and all the people that we saw in it are
[1:28:52] men of a great stature
[1:28:55] and there we saw the giants
[1:28:57] the sons of anac which come with the
[1:28:59] giants and we were in our own sight oh
[1:29:01] god in our own sight as grasshoppers
[1:29:04] and so we were in their sight
[1:29:08] and all the congregation having heard
[1:29:11] this faith-filled message
[1:29:18] lifted up their voice
[1:29:20] and cried
[1:29:21] and the people wept that night
[1:29:24] and all the children of israel murmured
[1:29:26] against moses and against aaron the
[1:29:28] whole congregation said unto them would
[1:29:30] god that we had died in the land of
[1:29:32] egypt
[1:29:33] or would god we had died in this
[1:29:35] wilderness
[1:29:37] and wherefore hath the lord brought us
[1:29:38] unto this land to fall by the sword
[1:29:41] that our wives and our children should
[1:29:43] be afraid were it not better for us
[1:29:46] to return into egypt
[1:29:48] and they said one to another
[1:29:50] let us make a captain and let us return
[1:29:53] into egypt
[1:29:55] you think about it where were all the
[1:29:57] people
[1:29:58] that here a while back we had a little
[1:30:01] movement the people that left the
[1:30:02] message where where did all that come
[1:30:04] from
[1:30:05] where what were those people doing
[1:30:07] before waiting on a leader
[1:30:10] waiting on a captain yeah one day they
[1:30:12] said let's make a captain
[1:30:14] and return to egypt
[1:30:16] oh but we have a captain too
[1:30:18] right our joshua the holy ghost
[1:30:22] is in the land today
[1:30:23] we have a captain hallelujah listen now
[1:30:26] this should have been their great hour
[1:30:27] of victory but they allowed the five
[1:30:29] senses to rule and the preachers
[1:30:31] preached the lack of faith into the
[1:30:32] people but our prophet did not preach a
[1:30:35] lack of faith but he preached faith yes
[1:30:37] sir yes he told us about the problems
[1:30:39] but he preached the promises of god
[1:30:41] right
[1:30:42] are you hearing me today i don't say you
[1:30:44] should be health wealth and prosperity
[1:30:46] constantly but there's got to be a
[1:30:48] balance of the
[1:30:49] if you don't balance the problems with
[1:30:51] faith you just preach faith right out of
[1:30:53] the people that's right
[1:30:55] yes there's problems but we are more
[1:30:56] than able to take the land
[1:30:59] amen oh caleb didn't deny that there
[1:31:01] were giants he didn't deny that there
[1:31:03] were wild cities we don't deny that it's
[1:31:06] hard today we don't deny that the world
[1:31:08] is against us but we have a god
[1:31:11] who is greater than any problem
[1:31:13] you're proof of that today church this
[1:31:15] church is a proof that god is greater
[1:31:17] than any problem the devil can throw at
[1:31:19] you we're proof that god forgives that
[1:31:21] god god heals that god says i hope
[1:31:24] you're hearing me today we're proof of
[1:31:25] that each one of you is individuals it's
[1:31:27] proof of that today that god is a
[1:31:29] resurrection power
[1:31:31] our god is a healer our god is a savior
[1:31:33] each one of you individually can say
[1:31:35] that don't be afraid to step out on the
[1:31:37] word of god don't be afraid to give up
[1:31:39] on your on your earrings and you're
[1:31:41] cutting your hair and going out don't be
[1:31:42] afraid be not afraid
[1:31:46] oh there's a land yonder you can walk
[1:31:48] into
[1:31:49] don't be afraid to give up your drinking
[1:31:50] and you're smoking in your and your
[1:31:52] cussing and all those things there's a
[1:31:53] land we can walk into yes sir oh we're
[1:31:56] gonna walk into a new body one of these
[1:31:58] days and if you have faith enough to see
[1:32:00] it today to look beyond the unseen you
[1:32:03] can see there's a body waiting for you
[1:32:06] amen
[1:32:08] hallelujah
[1:32:10] brother and said oh brother if that
[1:32:12] sixth sense could understand what we've
[1:32:15] been preaching about this week
[1:32:17] that the holy ghost god made this
[1:32:18] promise christ made the promise
[1:32:21] he said we took it to the scriptures
[1:32:22] this week back and forth and back and
[1:32:23] forth and combed it over until we know
[1:32:25] that god promised to do this thing he's
[1:32:28] doing now in this day the supernatural
[1:32:30] he said now real genuine faith would see
[1:32:32] that and catch a hold of it and all
[1:32:34] devils out of hell would never shake him
[1:32:37] away from it
[1:32:39] but we stumble at it
[1:32:41] it's not used enough
[1:32:44] we depend too much on the five
[1:32:47] and when most the time to 95 of the
[1:32:50] people are better as soon as they see
[1:32:52] the five senses is finished
[1:32:55] so in other words they can't discern a
[1:32:57] way out
[1:32:59] using the senses of the flesh
[1:33:02] and as soon as they see the five cents
[1:33:04] of this finish
[1:33:05] say well it's all gone
[1:33:08] dig my grave
[1:33:10] get my casket
[1:33:12] ready
[1:33:18] i may have told you before but my dad
[1:33:20] bless his heart every time he got a cold
[1:33:22] he rode out his funeral
[1:33:27] told whose pallbearers would be and
[1:33:30] who he was upset at at that certain time
[1:33:32] that would not preach the funeral and
[1:33:33] who would
[1:33:34] all of these things he did change all
[1:33:36] the time
[1:33:38] i found sadly
[1:33:40] that i've carried on the tradition
[1:33:45] i don't write it out but i do plan my
[1:33:46] funeral

[1:34:58] the presence of god this could be your
[1:35:00] day don't limit it by your five senses

[1:35:24] where will i use it brother ben for the
[1:35:26] trip you use it at school yes that's
[1:35:28] right
[1:35:29] you use faith at school to know when to
[1:35:31] when you what to do and how to how to do
[1:35:33] your classes and how to get over maybe
[1:35:36] abuse that you take peter knows about
[1:35:37] that peter's taking abuse
[1:35:40] a lot of times i don't mean physical but
[1:35:42] just just people find out he's a
[1:35:43] christian he's kind of
[1:35:45] quiet and tries to get along with
[1:35:46] everybody and then they see weakness and
[1:35:48] they come after you
[1:35:51] and peter's had to deal with that and he
[1:35:52] told me
[1:35:53] he's still kind of up in the air i
[1:35:55] didn't want to see him back to school
[1:35:56] this year
[1:35:57] i preached that message wednesday night
[1:35:58] on the way home
[1:36:00] peter said
[1:36:01] i wonder if those kids at school
[1:36:03] are the ninevites
[1:36:10] i said i don't know peter i don't know
[1:36:12] i want to protect you all i can protect
[1:36:14] you
[1:36:15] but use your faith if you go to school
[1:36:19] use your faith when you go to the doctor
[1:36:22] doctor don't know it all
[1:36:23] god does
[1:36:27] use your faith when you read the news oh
[1:36:29] you really need it when you read the
[1:36:31] news
[1:36:33] use your faith when you listen to your
[1:36:34] pastor use your faith when you listen to
[1:36:36] other ministry use your faith
[1:36:39] take the thing off your eyes use your
[1:36:41] faith lord i believe
[1:36:43] oh it may not be perfect circumstances
[1:36:45] but i believe there's a resurrection
[1:36:49] see unless you use your faith it'll
[1:36:51] become so dormant that you won't even
[1:36:52] believe a move of god when you see it
[1:36:56] the spies tasted the grapes saw the land
[1:36:58] flowing with milk and honey and still
[1:36:59] not did not believe they could do it
[1:37:01] brother branham said we become so
[1:37:03] earthbound with our senses he said well
[1:37:04] if i can't see it in them senses the
[1:37:06] devil gets into those senses and he will
[1:37:08] let you see something with your eyes
[1:37:11] and disbelieve it anyhow
[1:37:14] how many people have we shown i want to
[1:37:16] show it again to the kids we've shown
[1:37:17] the film you can find it on youtube
[1:37:19] brother branham i go back and watch it
[1:37:21] sometimes just to build my faith
[1:37:23] i'll go back and listen to prayer lines
[1:37:25] sometimes just to build my face because
[1:37:26] sometimes i need that how many times
[1:37:27] have we seen the film
[1:37:29] or brother brandon's standing up there
[1:37:30] and a man
[1:37:32] is going into another realm
[1:37:34] and telling people he doesn't know
[1:37:37] what their name was
[1:37:40] what their address was what their
[1:37:42] sickness was
[1:37:45] but see satan will work on you so much
[1:37:47] until you can see that and not believe
[1:37:49] it yeah that's right
[1:37:51] you can see something science cannot
[1:37:53] explain and they've been trying to do it
[1:37:55] for nearly 70 years
[1:37:57] they've been trying to explain how that
[1:37:59] gift was there and the charismatic say
[1:38:01] well he was a prophet but he got off the
[1:38:02] word and others say well he was just a
[1:38:04] fortune teller or some other thing they
[1:38:06] can't explain it but it's written in the
[1:38:08] word
[1:38:09] it's so plain isn't it it's so plain but
[1:38:13] satan will actually get you to
[1:38:15] disbelieve a prophet
[1:38:18] if you don't use your faith
[1:38:22] you can see it right in front of you so
[1:38:24] he didn't know what he was talking about
[1:38:25] shame on you
[1:38:30] god help us today he was a man he made
[1:38:32] mistakes absolutely he did
[1:38:34] he didn't he wasn't called to bring thus
[1:38:36] saith the lord as far as the scriptures
[1:38:37] he was called to shine a light on the
[1:38:39] scriptures tell us what it is
[1:38:42] but he was a prophet of god
[1:38:45] and we should we should believe that
[1:38:49] the devil gets you to disbelieve it many
[1:38:50] times you've kept your eyes closed along
[1:38:52] until you're blind he said
[1:38:54] a fellow said to me one time smite me
[1:38:56] blind smite be blind you believe in
[1:38:58] divine healing saying that holy ghost
[1:38:59] said paul preached might be blind i said
[1:39:00] i can't do it you're already blind
[1:39:03] i said your father the devil did that a
[1:39:04] long time ago so you're already blind
[1:39:06] for the bible said he's blind this
[1:39:08] gospel is said to anybody if it's hit to
[1:39:09] anybody it's those that are blind and
[1:39:11] hasn't tried to use their senses yes the
[1:39:13] sense of god gave them yes have you ever
[1:39:16] had your parents tell you that use the
[1:39:17] sense god gave you
[1:39:19] i always wanted to say which one
[1:39:24] we've been taught about the fight which
[1:39:26] chance am i supposed to use and it
[1:39:28] seemed like the one he wanted me to use
[1:39:29] was pain
[1:39:33] which since use the sense but that's
[1:39:35] what brother man i'm saying use the sins
[1:39:37] god gave you what is that
[1:39:38] faith use faith amen that sense if it's
[1:39:42] used it's a sense of deliverance
[1:39:44] oh do you need deliverance today that
[1:39:46] faith is a sense of deliverance when the
[1:39:48] other five fail that's why we still have
[1:39:51] prayer lines
[1:39:52] we still lay hands on the sick we still
[1:39:54] believe in the power of prayer why do we
[1:39:57] still do it he said it's outdated we
[1:39:58] don't need it no more why do we still do
[1:40:00] it because we still believe god's word
[1:40:02] is true yes
[1:40:04] yes you can receive it sitting right in
[1:40:05] your seat but sometimes you need a
[1:40:07] little extra boost of faith
[1:40:08] and if you need that god's good enough
[1:40:10] he's not like us he don't just cut
[1:40:12] people off but he keeps giving and he
[1:40:13] keeps giving he keeps sending gifts for
[1:40:15] the ramsay he said if i was god and the
[1:40:17] people didn't believe me what i said i'd
[1:40:18] just let him go he said but he keeps
[1:40:20] sending gifts he keeps sending men down
[1:40:22] through the age to come and with
[1:40:24] feelings and with prayer lines and with
[1:40:27] all kinds of different things he keeps
[1:40:28] doing it
[1:40:29] what's he doing he loves you
[1:40:32] he wants to do everything he can to help
[1:40:34] your faith
[1:40:35] but you got to have the faith
[1:40:37] see
[1:40:38] if your faith is alive it's not dormant
[1:40:41] then you go through the prayer line you
[1:40:42] may not feel anything
[1:40:44] any different than anybody else but you
[1:40:45] believe it
[1:40:47] and then you hold on to it until you get
[1:40:49] it
[1:40:50] i
[1:40:52] gabe and millie aren't here this morning
[1:40:53] and
[1:40:54] so i'll talk about them while they're

[1:41:47] line and sister millie's got some
[1:41:49] problems in her body and they come
[1:41:50] through the prayer line and said and she
[1:41:52] believed it when she come through and
[1:41:54] said you can tell sometimes when a
[1:41:55] person really believes that she believed
[1:41:57] it when she come through and every time
[1:41:59] i hear from well we're not doing too
[1:42:00] good today but we believe we got our
[1:42:02] healing in the prayer line
[1:42:04] thank god for that
[1:42:06] don't let colvin steal that from you
[1:42:09] don't let situation circumstances steal
[1:42:11] that from you you believe it yes
[1:42:14] amen and you say well what do i do if i
[1:42:16] just can't have faith well come back up

[1:42:21] it's fine keep seeking it keep pounding
[1:42:23] on the door keep knocking yeah
[1:42:25] god will give you that confidence yes
[1:42:28] brother branham talked about the two
[1:42:29] women and the angel of the lord how that
[1:42:31] the two women come to for healing and
[1:42:34] this is all from the faith is the sixth
[1:42:36] sense if you go back and listen to it
[1:42:37] you talked about those two women that
[1:42:38] were there
[1:42:39] and they both received healing in the
[1:42:41] prayer line said you're healed but
[1:42:42] neither one of them felt any better one
[1:42:44] couldn't eat the other one had a tumor
[1:42:45] on her neck
[1:42:46] he said in one day the angel of the lord
[1:42:48] passed through their area
[1:42:50] amen he come to make good on the word
[1:42:55] glory he come but they'd already been
[1:42:57] prayed for and they believed it and one
[1:42:58] day
[1:43:00] she there was a woman was sitting there
[1:43:01] she couldn't eat she couldn't drink
[1:43:03] coffee and she got up and she said i
[1:43:04] believe i'm healed and she got up and
[1:43:06] made a pot of coffee and she made some
[1:43:08] grits or some oatmeal and she began to
[1:43:09] eat it all of a sudden she could eat it
[1:43:12] there was no pain and she got so excited
[1:43:14] she run down the street and this other
[1:43:15] woman was screaming at the top of her
[1:43:17] voice that that that goiter that thing
[1:43:19] had fallen off of her neck
[1:43:22] oh god
[1:43:23] the angel of the lord had come to the
[1:43:24] area but what was he doing making good
[1:43:27] on their confession he's a high priest
[1:43:29] of your profession this morning
[1:43:32] amen and and he said they come to them
[1:43:34] he said what was it because they held on
[1:43:35] to that sick sense of the word of god
[1:43:37] that wouldn't take no for an answer
[1:43:39] they come to the meeting about two
[1:43:40] months after that both of them showed me
[1:43:42] how they were healed and everything what
[1:43:43] was it the sixth sense that sixth sense
[1:43:45] that sense of power that thing that
[1:43:48] delivered them
[1:43:49] not because i prayed
[1:43:51] but because they believed
[1:43:53] that's it that done it
[1:43:56] you talked about an insane woman i don't
[1:43:57] have time to get through all of this you
[1:43:59] talked about an insane woman that come
[1:44:01] and and her and her husband and they
[1:44:03] went down in the basement where she was
[1:44:04] and she'd crawl on her back and and she
[1:44:07] was a woman that she had a devil that
[1:44:09] was had possessed her brother brandon
[1:44:11] prayed for her but she didn't get better
[1:44:12] right away
[1:44:14] he prayed for her but then after a few
[1:44:16] days she she got better but he said
[1:44:18] about six months after that i was at
[1:44:19] jonesboro arkansas with richard reed at
[1:44:21] the old-fashioned revival our tabernacle
[1:44:24] he said used to be a big baptist
[1:44:25] tabernacle he said i was starting to
[1:44:27] preach i kept seeing somebody waving at
[1:44:28] me i didn't know who it was and she just
[1:44:30] couldn't stand it no longer she said you
[1:44:32] remember me had four or five little
[1:44:34] children i said i don't believe i do she
[1:44:36] said i never seen you before either she
[1:44:38] said i was the woman who was on my back
[1:44:40] crawling
[1:44:41] oh god listen this woman was completely
[1:44:44] insane and she would stare on her back
[1:44:46] crawling and brother branham said he
[1:44:47] even run from her
[1:44:50] he said i had to run from her
[1:44:52] up towards the stairs he said her
[1:44:54] husband in that six months time had been
[1:44:56] called to the ministry
[1:44:58] and he was going out to preach the
[1:44:59] gospel
[1:45:01] what is it holding on to that sixth
[1:45:03] sense
[1:45:04] faith said so yes and listen what the
[1:45:06] man said to husband he said i kept that
[1:45:08] in my heart
[1:45:09] if god could do such a thing to others
[1:45:11] now brother branham had told him this
[1:45:12] person was insane got healed this person
[1:45:15] was insane he related several stories
[1:45:17] and the man said if those people got
[1:45:19] their healing then i can get my healing
[1:45:22] oh do you still believe that today i
[1:45:24] believe we ought to tell our testimony
[1:45:26] when god heals us i believe we ought to
[1:45:27] wave that that white flag not of defeat
[1:45:30] but a victory
[1:45:31] we ought to waive it
[1:45:33] let people know not in a bragging way
[1:45:35] but say god did something for me
[1:45:38] and so he said i kept that in my heart
[1:45:40] if god could do such a thing to others
[1:45:41] he can do it for my wife he kept holding
[1:45:43] on to that nothing would separate him
[1:45:44] from it that's what the sixth sense will
[1:45:46] do when it's turned loose
[1:45:49] oh my let's turn it loose this morning
[1:45:51] let it have his controlling power
[1:45:54] he talked about john ryan he said are
[1:45:56] you okay for five more minutes
[1:45:58] i won't do you like brother wendell did
[1:46:02] he got five minutes from each of you he
[1:46:04] said i want to see that preacher and so
[1:46:05] they they brought him up there again and
[1:46:07] he said to me you told me i was healed
[1:46:09] you remember the story of john ryan he
[1:46:11] was he was blind
[1:46:12] he'd come up in the prayer line and
[1:46:14] brown said you're healed he just walked
[1:46:16] off but he couldn't see so he come back
[1:46:18] he said you said i was healed he said
[1:46:20] you are he said well if i was healed i
[1:46:22] could see
[1:46:23] and we had that question similar to that
[1:46:24] in the prayer line overseas one lady
[1:46:26] come to me why do i not feel any better
[1:46:29] well you got to believe
[1:46:31] it's based on your faith
[1:46:33] right but many were healed
[1:46:36] right but you got to believe
[1:46:37] and sometimes it's delayed now look he
[1:46:39] said you said i was healed i said you
[1:46:41] said you believed me he said i do
[1:46:43] believe you i said then what are you
[1:46:44] doubting about he said but i don't
[1:46:45] understand it what shall i do i said
[1:46:47] well the only thing to do is go on your
[1:46:48] road just praising god for giving you
[1:46:50] your eyesight
[1:46:51] oh some people need to pray about their
[1:46:53] spiritual eyesight today
[1:46:55] you need to pray about your faith vision
[1:46:56] yes
[1:46:57] he said where are you
[1:46:59] started pushing on now watch i see
[1:47:02] sometimes god lets us do something
[1:47:04] church i want to encourage that i don't
[1:47:06] want to i don't want to brother branham
[1:47:08] when he passed through perfect faith you
[1:47:09] may think that's kind of strange what
[1:47:11] brother andrew did when he was here with
[1:47:12] the with the trash can you remember that
[1:47:14] on a wednesday night you put yourself in
[1:47:16] a trash can but the brand did that in
[1:47:17] perfect faith
[1:47:19] said take it and drop it put it in your
[1:47:20] pocket bring your troubles up here put
[1:47:22] them in the box
[1:47:24] that's what he told the people to do
[1:47:25] yeah and that's where brother andrew
[1:47:27] gets that from i'm sure and so you you
[1:47:30] take that and and you uh he's just give
[1:47:32] him something because and there's no
[1:47:34] virtue in that right there's absolutely
[1:47:37] no virtue in a trash can
[1:47:39] none
[1:47:40] especially that one come out of my
[1:47:42] office
[1:47:44] but it's just a stinking trash can
[1:47:47] no virtue in it
[1:47:49] when we were overseas
[1:47:51] the people would take our water
[1:47:53] and the woman
[1:47:54] and i they may be listening today that
[1:47:56] most of them don't understand english
[1:47:57] but
[1:47:58] but the water they take a bottle of
[1:48:00] water i had a bottle of water about half
[1:48:01] full and a woman come up to me she goes
[1:48:03] like this and i said this and that i
[1:48:05] thought well maybe she she needs some
[1:48:07] water you know to drink and she grabs it
[1:48:09] runs off
[1:48:11] i never see her again
[1:48:12] he took my water and i found out they
[1:48:14] believed in holy water they come from a
[1:48:15] catholic background i wouldn't pray over
[1:48:17] the water that's a bridge too far
[1:48:20] but brother simeon was there with us
[1:48:21] brother simeon may be watching today
[1:48:23] from from ivory or coaster where's he
[1:48:26] from
[1:48:27] freetown uh one of those countries
[1:48:29] in west africa he's from freetown look
[1:48:32] up freetown and uh he's where brother
[1:48:34] simeon was i know it's getting late
[1:48:36] where brother simeon was he or when they
[1:48:39] caught those teammates he was just too
[1:48:40] kind to let him go and see he blessed
[1:48:42] the water you know i believe people got
[1:48:43] healed doing
[1:48:44] that just because they believed it
[1:48:48] you don't need water today nothing in
[1:48:50] this
[1:48:50] that you need maybe some things that i
[1:48:52] need nothing because i've been preaching
[1:48:54] too long but nothing else that you need
[1:48:58] but brother branham let john ryan i
[1:49:00] never caught this before he said let me
[1:49:02] feel you
[1:49:04] yeah john ryan come on the prayer line
[1:49:05] he said let me feel you he needed to be
[1:49:07] able to actually
[1:49:08] feel brother brandon know he was there
[1:49:09] yeah because that was the sense that he
[1:49:11] had
[1:49:12] and then he could believe
[1:49:14] oh god
[1:49:16] sometimes that's what a prayer line does
[1:49:18] he said let me feel you
[1:49:20] he said what is your name i said brandon
[1:49:21] he said let me feel you and i let him
[1:49:23] put my hands over
[1:49:24] he said mr branham as a catholic i'm
[1:49:26] taught to believe my priest he said i've
[1:49:27] come to you for help you told me who i
[1:49:29] was all about my conditions what nobody
[1:49:31] knows but god i believe it to be the
[1:49:32] truth i'll keep on saying praise god off
[1:49:34] the platform he went he said well i
[1:49:36] couldn't hardly have the service the
[1:49:37] next two nights he'd get up there where
[1:49:38] i was at praise the lord for healing me
[1:49:40] and i'd start preaching he'd raise up
[1:49:41] over hollering praise the lord for
[1:49:43] healing me give him a job selling papers
[1:49:45] nearly a month was gone hollering praise
[1:49:47] the lord for healing me he was down
[1:49:49] there he hollered extra praise the lord
[1:49:50] for healing me they laughed and made fun
[1:49:52] of him little knew the boys hissed at
[1:49:54] him people on the street said that old
[1:49:55] man has lost his mind he'd say extra
[1:49:57] extra read all about it praise the lord
[1:49:59] for healing me they took him and they
[1:50:01] thought he was going to have to send him
[1:50:02] to the insane institution they
[1:50:04] questioned him he said i'm just as
[1:50:05] normal in my mind as i ever was but i
[1:50:07] believe god how many believes god this
[1:50:08] morning
[1:50:09] praise the lord for healing me on like
[1:50:11] that what was it he was holding on to
[1:50:13] that sixth sense
[1:50:15] amen something had showed him where he
[1:50:17] was gonna land
[1:50:18] and when you can see where you're gonna
[1:50:20] land you can jump
[1:50:22] yes sir hallelujah
[1:50:25] amen he said that sight had nothing to
[1:50:27] do with it he was seeing with another
[1:50:29] side he's seen god
[1:50:31] amen he said we look at things we don't
[1:50:33] see all the christian armors by faith he
[1:50:35] that cometh to god must believe that he
[1:50:36] is all the fruits of the spirit
[1:50:38] everything is faith unseen we look at
[1:50:40] the unseen by faith we see it he said a
[1:50:42] little boy let him across the street to
[1:50:43] get a shave in a barber shop some little
[1:50:45] smart elk barber wanted to make some fun
[1:50:47] of him got to shave him and said you
[1:50:48] know he said say papa ryan he said yes
[1:50:50] son said i heard you go over to see the
[1:50:52] holy roller when he was up here he said
[1:50:53] yeah i did he said i heard you got
[1:50:55] healed he said yes i did praise the lord
[1:50:57] for healing me when he did that his eyes
[1:50:59] come open in the barber chair out of
[1:51:01] that chair he jumped with the towel
[1:51:02] around his neck the barber run of the
[1:51:04] door with the razor in his hand down the
[1:51:06] street went old man ryan just as hard as
[1:51:08] he could go screaming and shouting
[1:51:09] praise the lord he's healed me
[1:51:12] what was it holding on to that sixth
[1:51:14] sense
[1:51:16] he said that's something that makes it
[1:51:17] real
[1:51:19] oh do you believe in something that
[1:51:20] makes it real this morning
[1:51:22] amen i'm going to skip past these next
[1:51:24] scriptures
[1:51:26] thank you for pulling on me this morning
[1:51:27] it helps but it keeps me away from my
[1:51:29] notes so
[1:51:30] through the sixth sense to seek and
[1:51:32] knock down paul remember hebrews told
[1:51:34] about the heroes of faith in the old
[1:51:36] testament but the branham in the sixth
[1:51:37] sense goes down to the new testament
[1:51:39] he said the sixth sense the sea could
[1:51:41] not drown paul because he saw a vision
[1:51:43] of the angel of the lord
[1:51:45] amen he said the storm was just as great
[1:51:47] as it ever was but that sixth sense went
[1:51:49] to work when he'd seen the angel of the
[1:51:51] lord
[1:51:52] that sixth sense could not keep peter in
[1:51:53] jail he said the sixth sense they could
[1:51:55] not keep paul and silas in stocks god
[1:51:58] sent an earthquake he shook the whole
[1:51:59] thing down he said that sixth sense let
[1:52:01] it go to work for you sometime because
[1:52:03] of that sixth sense the lions couldn't
[1:52:05] even eat daniel they couldn't fool with
[1:52:06] that sixth sense
[1:52:08] by that same sixth sense here's where
[1:52:09] i'm coming to this morning
[1:52:11] that was working in little martha when
[1:52:13] she come to see jesus raised her brother
[1:52:15] out of the grave after being dead for
[1:52:17] four days don't you see that same sixth
[1:52:20] sense is why how you get your rapture
[1:52:22] what was martha type for the bride we
[1:52:24] went through that
[1:52:25] how she stood there and said lord i
[1:52:27] believe amen
[1:52:29] i believe that that in the i believe and
[1:52:32] he said i am the resurrection of life if
[1:52:34] you'd have been here she said my brother
[1:52:35] wouldn't have died but i am the
[1:52:36] resurrection of the life listen he gave
[1:52:38] her a revelation of a resurrection
[1:52:41] hey man you're giving that to us today
[1:52:44] amen that same sixth sense raised up
[1:52:45] jesus christ on the third day that same
[1:52:48] six cents will rapture the church one of
[1:52:50] these days and take it out of here to
[1:52:51] glory
[1:52:52] he said don't rely on the five they're
[1:52:54] deceitful but that sixth one's right
[1:52:56] musicians go ahead and come i'm going to
[1:52:58] close
[1:52:59] you talked about charlie and nelly cox
[1:53:01] but some of many of you remember charlie
[1:53:02] and nelly cox i've been in their house
[1:53:04] and and talked to them they're still
[1:53:05] alive as far as i know it
[1:53:07] and brother charlie cox he talked about
[1:53:09] them he said he took six cents he was
[1:53:11] talking about sixth sense and charlie
[1:53:12] taped it if i understand correctly what
[1:53:14] brother bran was saying charlie made a
[1:53:15] tape of brother branham just talking
[1:53:17] about it and because he tells it in the
[1:53:19] message the sixth sense he tells he
[1:53:21] takes that tape just brother brandon
[1:53:22] talking about it he takes it home and
[1:53:24] plays it receives the holy ghost
[1:53:27] he said and
[1:53:28] and then nellie said well if he could do
[1:53:30] that for him
[1:53:33] he could do it for me and she goes into
[1:53:35] her
[1:53:36] room and plays shuts the door and plays
[1:53:38] that about six inches brother branham
[1:53:39] talking about it and god gave her the
[1:53:41] holy ghost yes
[1:53:44] amen brother brown said what is it if
[1:53:45] you believe it we should believe it
[1:53:47] without any seeing but yet god lets us
[1:53:49] see it anyhow
[1:53:51] oh god this is what i love he shows it
[1:53:54] to us
[1:53:54] he shows us his presence
[1:53:57] surely then there'd be no excuse
[1:53:59] that that sixth sense won't go to work
[1:54:03] we talked last week and i read you the
[1:54:04] quote where the man that believes in god
[1:54:06] can see the presence of god feel the
[1:54:07] presence of god since the presence of
[1:54:09] god and no he's here
[1:54:12] moses negotiated with god for his
[1:54:14] presence to be with him see we we
[1:54:15] shouldn't have to see him but he lets us
[1:54:17] see him
[1:54:18] he lets us feel him even in the five
[1:54:20] senses or when you do but you won't ever
[1:54:24] recognize it without a sixth sense
[1:54:26] it's awakened
[1:54:28] moses negotiated with it he
[1:54:30] lord told him he said well he said i'm
[1:54:31] going to send you up but my presence
[1:54:32] won't go with you he said if your
[1:54:33] presence doesn't go with me i don't want
[1:54:35] to go
[1:54:36] i said no if my presence is going out
[1:54:38] with me carry us on a pence
[1:54:40] and god said i'll send my presence with
[1:54:42] you
[1:54:43] he said i beseech thee moses went a
[1:54:45] little further i pray that we would go a
[1:54:47] little further this morning
[1:54:49] i want to know you lord
[1:54:51] it's not enough just to
[1:54:53] go to church and say i have faith i
[1:54:55] believe i want to know you
[1:54:57] i want revelation in my life
[1:55:00] i want to see your face i want to sense
[1:55:03] your glory
[1:55:05] wouldn't you like to be like that where
[1:55:06] you could sense the presence of god but
[1:55:08] the brown said a man that believes god
[1:55:10] can
[1:55:11] you can sense his presence you can know
[1:55:13] he's there
[1:55:15] oh god
[1:55:17] he said i love this he said show me your
[1:55:19] glory god said i'll make all my goodness
[1:55:21] pass before thee
[1:55:24] hallelujah he put moses in the cleft of
[1:55:26] the rock covered him up with his hand
[1:55:28] and his faith it only allowed him to see
[1:55:30] the back part of god because remember it
[1:55:32] was a theophany form of god he had to
[1:55:33] come in christ so we could see him face
[1:55:35] to face we've seen him now
[1:55:39] amen
[1:55:40] one day
[1:55:41] first john 1 1 john could stand there
[1:55:43] and say that which we heard was from the
[1:55:45] beginning
[1:55:46] which we have heard
[1:55:48] which we have seen
[1:55:50] in other words it comes from faith come
[1:55:52] by hearing we heard about it but we saw
[1:55:54] it
[1:55:56] we've seen with our eyes we've looked
[1:55:58] upon our hands have handled it
[1:56:01] of the word of life
[1:56:02] now we've seen him
[1:56:04] listen church we see him today by faith
[1:56:06] don't we we don't see him in a corporal
[1:56:08] body
[1:56:09] but one day we'll be like john would say
[1:56:11] i saw him
[1:56:13] in the flesh
[1:56:15] but you can see his presence like moses
[1:56:17] today he's still here
[1:56:19] if you want to see him bad enough you
[1:56:20] can feel his presence
[1:56:22] you can know he's there would you bow
[1:56:23] your heads with me if we play something
[1:56:29] one day our faith will be a reality but
[1:56:31] it can be a reality to us now
[1:56:33] by faith
[1:56:35] faith is the substance
[1:56:39] the the reality the real thing
[1:56:42] of things hoped for the evidence
[1:56:45] the proof of things not seen
[1:56:49] do you want to see him today
[1:56:51] i know we need to see him
[1:56:53] i'm a little bit like moses you can go
[1:56:56] off if you want to without his presence
[1:56:58] say well the promise is good i believe
[1:57:00] in the promise
[1:57:01] what i want is presence too
[1:57:04] moses said if your presence doesn't go
[1:57:05] with me
[1:57:06] don't send me lord
[1:57:09] well that's the kind god gives the
[1:57:10] promises to is the ones who want him to
[1:57:13] along for the ride
[1:57:15] they want him to be with them
[1:57:17] is that your prayer you want him to be
[1:57:18] with you at school
[1:57:19] at work
[1:57:20] all through life lord be with me
[1:57:23] lord i believe your word i i believe i
[1:57:25] have faith today to believe it but let
[1:57:27] me let me just have a sense of your
[1:57:29] feeling of your presence lord i know
[1:57:31] that won't be wrong because it's written
[1:57:33] in your word that i can have it
[1:57:34] your prophet told me that if i believe
[1:57:36] you i could know that you're near lord
[1:57:38] and i want to recognize when you're near
[1:57:40] so i can take advantage of your presence
[1:57:43] i want to be able to entertain you lord
[1:57:45] so let me see you in whatever form you
[1:57:47] present yourself in
[1:57:50] let's make that our prayer this morning
[1:57:52] heavenly father
[1:57:54] lord we thank you so much
[1:57:56] lord for the feeling of your presence
[1:57:58] and the knowledge and the understanding
[1:58:00] that you're here
[1:58:01] but lord we want to know you more we
[1:58:03] want to know you by your word lord we
[1:58:06] know that that ought to be enough but
[1:58:08] we're human beings we live in five
[1:58:10] senses and satan constantly bombards us
[1:58:14] oh god he bombards us through these five
[1:58:17] senses
[1:58:18] and through the senses of our spirit he
[1:58:20] bombards us with reasoning and
[1:58:22] imagination and conscience
[1:58:25] lord telling us we're not good enough
[1:58:26] tell us we won't make it
[1:58:28] lord to this morning we want a sense of
[1:58:31] your presence
[1:58:32] or that we can know that you're the same
[1:58:34] yesterday today and forever
[1:58:36] we want to know lord we're we're simple
[1:58:38] creatures we're human beings
[1:58:40] or we have faith today but lord
[1:58:43] sometimes we have to reach out and feel
[1:58:44] you
[1:58:45] we want a god with skin on it oh god
[1:58:48] help us to recognize it or help us not
[1:58:50] to lord if it's if it's a person you sit
[1:58:53] by our way if it's a family member if
[1:58:55] it's a if it's a pastor if it's a deacon
[1:58:58] or somebody else in the church lord now
[1:59:00] you sit by our way may we recognize god
[1:59:02] in flesh
[1:59:04] lord be willing to say lord i believe it
[1:59:06] was you wasn't that person but i believe
[1:59:08] it was you that spoke to me today
[1:59:10] i believe that you came and raised my
[1:59:12] faith up to a level where i can believe
[1:59:15] all the blinders have been taken off my
[1:59:17] eyes i can see
[1:59:18] thank the lord for my healing
[1:59:21] i can see you in the power of your
[1:59:22] resurrection i pray you'd grant that
[1:59:24] today maybe there'd be somebody lord
[1:59:26] maybe their father blinded them or their
[1:59:29] their their family history lord was
[1:59:32] always one of unbelief
[1:59:33] lord and then they come into the message
[1:59:35] of the hour and that unbelief just
[1:59:37] lingers and it just lingers on and and
[1:59:39] on to the children oh god would you
[1:59:41] break that thing today lord may there be
[1:59:44] a reality of your presence so we can

[2:00:00] help us to keep a balance in these
[2:00:01] things lord not to go by feelings we
