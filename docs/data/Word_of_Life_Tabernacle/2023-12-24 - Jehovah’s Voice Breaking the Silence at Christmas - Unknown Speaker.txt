telling them that Jesus is Alive you know because they were asking if Bethlehem is a real place and so we were telling them yeah it really is and and they were under the impression that that Jesus was alive over there with Joseph and Mary and so you know I was like well man we've done a really good job presenting the Bible to them you my kids were ready to go to Bethlehem and meet Joseph and Mary so but anyways I thought that was a cute little little story so but we love do you love the Lord this morning amen why don't you go Ahad and stand with me let's sing that song Touching Jesus we'll

amen and and we just appreciate them amen just turn around we love them amen appreciate and give them a good hand wish we could do more but amen we appreciate it appreciate the church so much and I try my best to be a giver and not a take sacred Christmas but uh I try to also be a good uh recipient and uh let's uh that's all the singing we'll have right now uh you can be seated for just a moment I I'm always awkward receiving gifts and thanks and U but I do want my family to be recognized because they do uh so much for the church and uh we appreciate that my uh children I went back there the other day at the Christmas play and I realized how little I knew about what they were doing now CU I had to train them how to do all that and and uh if you haven't been back in the back you might go take a look sometime in in that room where they're at and brother noie and sister Levi have stepped up to help sister Levi and brother holy I didn't sleep last night but uh Harvey's telling me just stop uh sister noie and brother Levi have stepped up to help with that too and we really appreciate them and I want to say to all the officers of the church thank you for doing what you do and and being a part I know there several aren't here this morning but uh they're uh visiting family and things but the Joel's watching from Wisconsin this morning and and uh so we want to greet them and and uh just such a big help my wife does so much and yet uh you've wor you've been diligent about taking some of that load off of her and I appreciate that as well and uh I wanted to uh uh just let you know a couple things that going to be going on uh we're looking forward to a good year we had a good year and uh looking forward to another good year in the Lord and Lord just really blessed the church and uh Joel's making fun of me I wish I didn't get text on this iPad um I'm going shut that off it's all right to relax a little bit in church it's okay and uh but I wanted to uh I wanted to thank brother Harvey and sister Jackie said that right didn't I for the uh Christmas party for helping with that for the idea for that and so many help them with that and Jeff and Patty Rebecca and Sophie the Sunday School teachers brother Jeremy uh different ones that helped brother Joel different ones that helped with the Christmas play wasn't that good uh we them kids did so good the other night and I just made my made my day and I wanted to say that maybe your kids didn't get to be involved I know some were sick and brother Stuart and sister Allison have had a uh have had a rough time this holiday season trying to get their family healthy and and I know that um I know you say well it didn't do us any good because we weren't AP part but even being around that practicing doing all it teaches you to work together and and to sacrifice something for the common good and so we appreciate everybody that put something into that and and uh one of these years we'll get everybody in the same play but till we do we just enjoy uh what we did have and and we really appreciated that uh brother Bailey I want you to remember him he's still recovering and uh now is a hard time if you don't realize that it's a difficult time for people who've had surgery people who've been sick because to be around other people who might be sick could be a problem so brother Bailey's recovering at home so keep him in your prayers if you think about it send him a note or call him and I'm sure he'd appreciate that and brother Stewart is going to be preaching Wednesday night the Lord willing so you pray for him and his family that they'll be able to do that and he's going to preach Wednesday night uh brother George moral is coming through he'll be here Sunday morning and Jo brother Joel will be here Sunday night uh I'm going to go away for a week and a half and then we'll be back uh I just I need a break and uh I appreciate y'all allowing me to do that my family's going to go with me we're just going to drive till it gets warm and and um find someplace to stay and then uh we'll uh we'll do that you love the Lord this morning amen isn't God good to us amen I just had a a thought come on my heart let's stand together I think it would be appropriate for Christmas time we're going to read from Luke Chapter 2 and verse one before we do let's let's bow our heads a word of prayer heavenly father I ask you once again to come and help me this morning Lord I I thank you for this church Lord and their patience and with us Lord and and struggling through things Lord like they struggle through and we thank you for that and I thank you for Lord the gift of your son that you wrapped yourself in a body of Flesh came down Among Us I'm so grateful for that today I pray God that you just move in this service Lord though it may be a little bit different Service as Christmas Eve and people are thinking about other things but I pray God that you just come down and focus our attention on your word may we receive Revelation today May there be strength Lord that would come from the word of God to make it Lord through this season and every season of Our Lives I pray that you'd bless it today I pray that you'd move Lord through the congregation and and and and through me Lord and speak your word and Lord may you open up our hearing to hear heal those that are sick touch those that are afflicted we pray in Jesus name amen amen Luke Chapter 2 and verse 1 says it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed this taxing was first made when Sirus was governor of Syria all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered she brought forth her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end pray the Lord would add his BL listening to the word you may be seated if you had been near the stable that morning or that night that Christ was born you would have been in darkness figuratively literally and the Darkness would have been broken the silence would have been broken by the sound of a baby cry and there were many babies perhaps born at that time in that season but this was special in fact that cry changed everything because the word had come to its fulfillment and the things that God had told us would happen begin to happen and all that all of of the Old Testament was had been condensed and wrapped up and brought down and all the Fulfillment of Prophecy would be in this body that God had made on the Earth but he didn't come as an adult he come as a baby the word was born you could say it like this that Jehovah cried incarnate for the first time he had he had he had been in MDC he'd been but he'd never been a baby he for the first time his voice was heard on the earth for 400 years they' not had a prophet they hadn't even had inspiration there was no open Vision there was no ability to see and so God had to speak to Joseph even in a dream because there was no Prophet there but now God was going to speak himself and there would be uh there would be an embodiment of Jehovah of deity that God would wrap himself deity in flesh holy God and holy man and and would actually be in flesh and would become one of us and would know what we know and we go through what we go through I'm so grateful he did that aren't you glad that he did that and if you can imagine that cry just that was God speaking and yet you couldn't understand what he was saying he cried like any other baby it sounded like just another baby but it wasn't just another baby it was God and you might go through times in your life you might go through seasons of Darkness you might be in a season of Darkness Ness right now it excuse me your life might be a struggle but yet you know that the silence the the the the darkness can be broken by The Cry of Jehovah in your life and it may not be even it may be unintelligible it may not be something you can understand at the present moment but it's going to grow it's going to become something that begins to speak one day and begins to speak words that can be understood you see Jehovah cried because he spoken they'd ask for a sign and Isaiah the prophet some 400 years before or many many hundreds of years before in Isaiah 7: 11 he said ask the a sign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said ahaz was the king of Judah at that time he said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and he said hear you now House of David is it a small thing for you to weary men but will you weary My God also therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel Emmanuel means god with us there there's a translation of that that I love it's the strong God With Us God With Us in his strength Jehovah god brother BR said become man took on our stock he took on our stock crossed himself from God and become man and I never knew what that meant exactly brother BR uses the uh uses the phrase he says God pitched his tent with man and then he says God changed his strain I never knew what that meant until Co and Co being a virus is a living thing right and it changed its strain from one you remember they had Delta and Omron and all these names that they gave it it changed its strain right and and so it was still what it was and yet it becomes something else and so God remaining Jehovah remaining God but he changes his strain literally it's it's it's the language you use of DNA he changes his strength to become a man God crossed himself from God and become man changed his strength he was God and become man not a rich man but a poor man oh I'm so glad that he did not a rich man but a poor man he said this is the super sign you've asked for a sign said God I'll give you one an everlasting sign right he could have come otherwise as I've said but a baby why did he become a baby he said when that first little toothless mouth opened in that manger on that first Christmas morning in his little manger crib the first little yell that went from his voice that was God cry gy to God it was Jehovah speaking yet he could not be understood and he would not be recognized in that form and the world would not see him but some Shepherds knew because it was revealed to them this is God and the wise men knew that come when he was 2 years old and gave him appropriate gifts at that time why did they know they there was nothing a 2-year-old baby did that would make him look any different from any other 2-year-old but yet they recognized by Revelation that was God and I'll say this when Christ is born in you there's got to be a revelation of the new birth in your life because you're not going to be a full grown Christian all at once and you've got to recognize that you're a child of God you've got to recognize you've been born again that your sins have been forgiven come on now you've got to have a revelation of who you are just as he had a revelation they had a revelation of who he was you become God become a man it was God crying Jehovah crying a man come from God and was man every wit man come to the world with nothing but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he said he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a boy on the street he toiled like a man but yet he was Emmanuel this is the super sign God dwelling in the creation that he created I want you to think deeply with me this morning as deeply as you can to understand this this morning there's something going on when Jehovah decides to cry when Jehovah when Jehovah decides Now's the Time to be born into the world and we know that God's voice brings order out of chaos and darkness and silence is a symbol of chaos and and you'll find that things are out of order in the beginning there was no voice on the earth there was no there was nothing to put it in order the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void verse two the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters yet God as of this time had not yet spoke but now in verse three God said let there be light God said something and there was light God's voice brought oh my God's voice brought order out of chaos and when Christ is born in Bethlehem his The Cry of God at that time brought begin to bring order begin to bring fulfillment to the seeds that had already been planted the word that had already been given the voice of God began to bring fulfillment to that and I hope you're following me this morning now he spoke and the silence was broken by the manifested word now it was not enough for the spirit of God just to over Shadow Mary that had to happen the spirit of God had to do that she she had to be overshadowed and there had to be a conception of the Holy Ghost it was without sensation the conception was without sensation because it could not be by the hands of a man but there also had to be a birth right and at the birth there was a cry right right because God had to announce that he was alive right amen amen you you're remember when your kids were born those of you have children remember when your kids were born maybe you Tred to forget it I remember when my kids were born all three of them the first one was traumatic the other two they just uh did the C-section of surgery they just brought them to me you know that's pretty good but uh but I remember when Peter was born and and I remember what they did to him I you know and I got a little mad at him cuz I didn't realize that he wasn't breathing and they needed him to make some noise so they they take they rough him up and they throw him on the on the little shelf there and and and put the oxygen mask on and they're kind of they're just rough with him you know drying him rough with him and I was like what why why you got to be so rough well they're trying to make him cry yes because when they make the crying clears the lungs yes of all that fluid and things and so they they have to be able to cry and and when you hear him cry at one point during Peter's birth we lost his heartbeat and so we we were we were scared for his life and we didn't know whether he was going to come out alive or dead and so when he was finally born they we we we he didn't say nothing for a little while it was a while before they they worked on him for a while and finally you hear sounds more like a sheep don't it little it does sound like a goat and sheep it's been so long since my kids were little I can't even cry like a kid but it cried and you all heard that in the play the other night when during the play at some point it was a baby cry what was it it told you something it was there the sound effect was there for a reason it was there to tell you there there was a baby born oh my there had to be a cry and the birth had taken place and the silence was broken by the manifestation of the word now we know that he was the word John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he was the word at the beginning in John 1:14 he says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the word was made flesh Born Into the Darkness of the of the season to break the chaos of Silence to bring order out of nothing are you with me so far so there had to be a birth of the word during the first creation there was a birth of the word at the beginning of time there had to be a birth at Christmas time there had to be a birth on Pentecost right because he had to die he could not he in John 12:20 he could not remain in the form that he was in John 12:20 it tells us that there were certain Greeks among them that come up to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to philli which was a Bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus and Philip cometh and tth Andrew and again Andrew and philli tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified now remember these are Greeks and he was sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel but he's telling them that I need to go into another form I need to pass from this form into another form so that you can recognize and you can see who I am so he needed to die and be reborn in them so that they would recognize who he was and so God could speak again because God he didn't stop speaking when Jesus left the Earth Jehovah since that time he's always been here he's always lived in somebody oh brother BR said that's the story of Christmas and go listen to God's gifts always find their places he said the story of Christmas is Christ in you right and there's a very deep Revelation there as we begin to recognize that Christmas is not just a baby and a Manger but because he came because the silence was broken because he grew up because he he because he became the word because he fulfilled the word because he died on the cross because he he he was buried and rose again on the third day because he did all of that he could come back back in the Believers on Pentecost so now he tells them these Greek Believers he says the hour is come the son of man shall be glorified verily verily I say un you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit sir so brother brandom says this he said just as soon as these Greeks was pointed to Jesus Jesus did not point to himself or or he did not make himself known to them him because you cannot know Jesus in that way Jesus isn't known in that way it was a cute little story brother Allan was talking about his kids and but Jesus is not known in that way and kids I hope you hear me today all older folks I hope you hear me today Jesus is not known in a Manger today Jesus is not known even as as a a human being if we could say it that way today he doesn't there will come a day when uh we believe we'll see him in In the Flesh how many believe that that's brother said that's what Believers believe amen that that we'll see him in the Corporal Body of Christ and yet today during the Gentile age he's not known that way and he's explaining to these Greeks this is not how I'm known he said you cannot know Jesus in that way Jesus isn't known in that way he and and I want you to notice and brother Ram goes into this in some depth in a sermon called Serge we would see Jesus he said he did not try to explain who he was yeah he didn't stand there and say now I was born in Bethlehem I'm the baby that was in the manger you can go talk to the rabbi or talk to the uh to the Shepherds rather talk to the Magi talk to all the people that uh that that that recognized my birth he did not ever point to his birth but what did he do to the Gentiles he pointed to his death and he said he said except a corn of wheat fall in the ground and dies it abides alone and now but brother B said they were brought into his presence he said that's the main thing get the people in his presence oh that's what we need today sometimes we try to explain it so much but what we need to do is get the people in his presence let me tell you this this morning you might have had a hard life you might have a lot against you but if you could ever get in his presence things would begin to change he'd begin to reveal himself to you amen yes sir so he said what he said the main thing is get the people in his presence he said what an unusual thing instead of accepting their introduction the thing that he done was pointed them to a place that they could find him except a corn of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone he said what did he do here he pointed them to that great truth of how to see him they could not oh my see him in the way of eternal life just standing there the way he was because he was a man now the word had to be born again after his death burial and Resurrection again silence Jesus had been taken off the Earth chaos they didn't know what was going to happen but they were obeying a a command of God and the promise was about to be fulfilled right and it was broken by the voice of a baby an infant Church church now think about it for a moment it was broken by the voice of God in his people all right another Christmas time at Pentecost and so now in Acts chapter 2 and verse one we find when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clo and tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak all right noises proof of life now brother B tells us I don't time to get into it this morning brother bam tells us he said if your religion doesn't have any noise to it he said you need to go bury it amen said because it's dead right what was the noise yes sir oh I wish I could preach this morning what was the noise the proof of life right amen just like in the manger the noise was a proof that God deity had been born in human vessels again deity had been born but it wasn't just any noise come on Amen now watch it wasn't just noise for the sake of noise but it was noise fulfilling the word of God there you go with other tongues I with with other tongues and he said with uh all these things I'll speak to my people I'll pour my spirit on All Flesh and and people begin to wonder what's going on and Peter stands up and begins to preach and he says this day these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that this noise amen is the result of people being born yes Christ being born in the hearts of the people oh I trust that would be the case with us today we would never be a dead cold place it would never be a silent place but that way the noise could be a not just noise for the sake of the music not just no noise for the sake of well so and so is doing it I might as well do it too but noise because there's a living God because he's being manifested in the hearts of the people right and Peter began to stand and say this is that and when they heard this acts 237 they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do and I'll say this this is still what you have to do right do you want to be saved here's how to do it you want to be filled with the Holy Spirit here's how to do it you want to change your life this is it yes this is still the prescription amen and you got to take it just like the way he G gave it in order to receive the benefit of it he said Peter said then repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what was it order and come out of chaos New Creation just like at the beginning at the very beginning of time when God's voice spoke the Sun come to its place the moon come to its place the seeds begin to grow everything begin to take its place and the church oh my was just 120 desperate individuals there just 120 people who couldn't get along about anything but when they come in one Accord in one place all of the sudden here come the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost come it set the church in order oh my and the church begin to do what a church does amen oh that's what we need today first of all we need the Holy Ghost to come we need the voice of Jehovah to cry out and put the church in order I believe we've had it in our day now look the baby cried the word had been born in the hearts of 120 men and women now this newborn early church had to grow up had to mature in an Ephesian church had to be born had to be born but also had to die right right because if they hadn't they just went in the rapture we wouldn't be here that's right right but the time wasn't yet for the Rapture of the church so what happened there had to be a falling into the ground sir right except the corn of wheat fall into the ground it abides the loone so it had to fall into the ground and people didn't understand that but it had to happen Luther had to come along at the end of a of a period of Darkness Luther come along all of a sudden the cry the voice of God could be heard again and brother Bram goes into that in depth in the church age book he said the Lutheran spoke for God until they denominated and they no longer spoke for God but there was a voice of God in that age sir the Lutheran spoke for God the Methodist under Wesley spoke for God for a brief time but then they denominated Pentecost spoke for God for a time but it denominated and the oh my in this age the voice of Jehovah has been heard again amen now now listen we'll go through it so we understand and I I told you we going have to think a little bit deep maybe you say well this is strange for Christmas Eve but but I think it's appropriate to the hour that we're living in because Christmas means something special to us as Believers it's not just Santa Claus and all these other things but there's something about it to Believers it means something he was born it wasn't on December 25th but he was born right so we celebrate that then become the light and the Darkness to a lost world doesn't understand why he was born historically after about three years of Revival a denomination forms around a move of God how many know that brother Bram taught us that and you can look in history and find it so there's three years of Revival and then denomination forms and denomination is how a church dies brother brandom speaks about it this way he said dear dying lamb may it never do that sir he said if I go in this generation May the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination yes sir he said you'll die right in your track that's why that that as a local church we're a sovereign local church and I'll say this some people may watch and see some of the things we do say well you can't do that but what we have to answer to is the message of the hour we don't have a headquarters beyond that there's not a brother in some other state that I call to try to find out what I can do and what I can't do do as a pastor I've got the Bible for that and I've got the message for that right and I've got Brothers I lean on as far as wisdom and experience but it's got to come back to the word it's got to come back to the word everything we do and you should hold me accountable to the word of God I'm not accountable to what everybody else does but I am accountable to the word and so you should hold me accountable to that I'll say this if you hold me accountable to that we should hold ourselves accountable to the same word so after three years of Revival denomination that forms and he said if you do that you'll die right in your track he said remember that the very hour that you mentioned denomination among you he said I don't care how sincere you are take Man For Your Leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word he said that's the hour you die right and I love this next quote he said but the genuine seed cannot yeah it cannot cannot form denomination I believe we're genuine seed this morning because there's nothing left he said after the seed so there's no prophecy that this one has to die when this voice of Jehovah is born into this age it does not die again right right oh my but it comes to maturity and takes a Rapture right now he said the genuine seed cannot well that gives me great hope yes sir it cannot die yes sir it cannot go into denomination there may be all kinds of clicks and clans form but the genuine seed cannot he said there's nothing left after the seed it's the same thing it was back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again amen there was chaos of joining church and reciting Creeds and some of you were involved in that chaos you know what it's like I think the problem with some of us as some younger people's they've never been exposed to denominationalism and what it was really like they they just don't know and so they become very critical of the message because you say well I denomination seem like everybody gets along oh baloney you've never been to a Baptist board meeting I guarantee you that I'm not speaking bad of the Baptist but we you know we're human beings too you think we're the only ones that have problems come on everybody does and they don't got nothing to call them back there's no there there's no nothing but a dead letter to go back to there nothing but a Creed but we've got a living word amen yes sir been in some of those Holiness come up around the Church of God Holiness I've been in some of their board meetings I've s through some of that talk about carnality they thank God for the holy ghost at least when I deal with you I mostly deal with Holy Ghost filled people and I thank God for that every day but there was didn't even believe in the the Holy Ghost there was a chaos Darkness we need to remember we don't want to go back to that we don't want to go back to denominational Pentecost we we don't want to go back to the chaos but the word spoke and brought CA order out of chaos I look another silent night broken by The Cry of an infant but it would not be an infant groom right you realize at some point your your spouse had to be a baby so there had to be an infant bride and an infant groom oh my there had to be an infant groom that come and and when he cried they're in the manger it was the announcement he was on the earth that if there was an infant groom there had to be an infant bride that would also cry yes sir and we know when the baby Christ was born there was a an astronomical event that took took place at that time that there were there were stars that come together and formed but formed a star that the wise men could see and they could see that it would was going to happen you know they can predict that when it could happen they've been doing that for thousands of years and they predicted by the stars that something great was going to take place and they even connected that to the prophecy because Daniel had been down there in Babylon and had left those prophecies there of a Messiah that would come and so because they had access to the Scrolls and things in Babylon the Magi could connect the prophecy with the Stars and they could see that something was about to happen and then they were also supernaturally LED but they come during that time and so those Stars went together brother BR said three stars went together made one morning star reflected the coming of infant Christ a perfect one but there was something that happened in February of 1962 you probably heard brother brand preach about it on tape but it was an actual event that took place and it was an earth shattering event was a planetary alignment and it I'm not going to ask who watched it but do you remember the movie 2012 oh it got real quiet it was a Hollywood movie called 2012 remember 2012 people were saying no November I think it was of 2012 the world was going to end we forget things so quickly me remembers uh you remember Y2K my kids would never understand that we thought computers couldn't handle another digit right we were all going to die planes were going to fall the sky and everything like that I kept I remember in a watch Night Service keeping a flashlight by my chair y 2K cuz I you know you kind of bought into that and you remember what that was like well 2012 was an event like that because the Mayan had looked at the stars and said well there's going to be a coming together of stars and so everything's going to fall apart I read an article this week from Earth magag dog and it talked about the same thing happened in 1962 in February there was a planetary alignment that raised doomsday fears it says similar doomsday fears and that alignment also included the five planets visible to the naked eye Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn as well as the Moon and the Sun on top of that it was a total solar eclipse astronomer Robert Richardson of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles California described the scene outside the building on February 4th the day that the alignment took place by 2:00 the road leading to and from the observatory was a solid mass of cars lined up bumper to bumper for half a mile he said one woman was weeping so badly it was hard to understand her she was practically on the verge of collapse she said I know it's silly to carry on this way she gased between SS but I can't help myself others around the world had even more extreme reaction stalking up bomb shelters in the United States holding non-stop prayer vigils attended by millions in Bombay India one group of Believers moved in Mass to the town of cleor I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right Arizona which the group thought was one of only 12 spots in the world safe from the imminent disaster others claimed that the alignment was responsible for the assassination the following year US President John F Kennedy so they recognized something was going on and people were scared by it they didn't know what it was when Jesus was born the Magi recognized something was going on on watching the stars but they were Guided by the word and and and by the Holy Spirit to where he was brother BR said he guided them supernaturally for two years to the place where he lay but now we we look at this that happened in 1962 you say well that's happened several times over the years happens every few hundred years or something like that you say well that's happened several times but there was a Vindicated Prophet on the earth at the time it happened yes you see a dream may be just a dream unless there's a Vindicated Prophet to interpret it right right uh Stars lining up maybe just Stars lining up unless there's a Vindicated Prophet on the earth we we don't know what it means it means something but we don't know what it means unless there's a Vindicated Prophet on the earth to tell us what it means and I'm glad that we had one I'm glad there was one on the earth when this event happened because it was it meant something to us as the bride now he said brother brandom talked about it he said now what's happened and this is I think about a month later after this took place he said now what's happened we see a roar in the paper across the television out across the Nations where five stars just fell in line with the world he said what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come he said then something happens on the earth what taken place five stars fell in excuse me what was it he said an introducing of what oh I hope you get it this morning he said since then just look at what's taking place Germany almost washed off the map he said some of the Magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful thing that's prophesied by them for the last days he said look what's taking place England the other day had a storm that blowed away 70,000 houses in one day disasters were California Los Angeles he said like to wash in the ocean what is it he said beginning of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up everywhere why is it he said five stars come in line Grace God's grace listen closely what's happened an infant Church yes amen sir Hallelujah sir a bride infancy yes that the power of God has begin to fall on her amen and it was just like it was then people didn't recognize it but a prophet on the earth identified it yes sir amen just like John said there he is remember John identified Christ where he was and there had to be a friend of the brid a bridegroom but there also had to be a friend of the Bride there had he had to identify the bridegroom but he also had to identify the bride amen so he stands there and he says what happened in infant Church a bride infancy that the power of God has begin to fall on her she is taking form a bride for this bridegroom I hope you can see it this morning he said that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father three stars when he come the first time he said of the Trinity becoming one on earth Among Us God's offices becoming one office he said what happened now what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach you said but brother Ben if I have lived back then I'd have recognized this great sign in the heavens took place and there was a baby born and I'd have seen it and I'd have known Jesus was on the Earth but where is he today I tell you the same thing happened to you the same thing happened to you the there was an announcement that you would be here and what oh my what could possibly hold you back from fulfilling the word of God in your day oh I hope you hear me this morning what could possibly hold you back from being what God called you to be he announced your birth all right come on that's good Hallelujah yes sir he announced oh my I'm not going to be here next week so yall just bear with me he he announced your birth in the heavens and said there would be a bride oh I want to I'm I believe I'm part of that bride today you say but I've made so many mistakes but we are not we're not we don't have to be the bridegroom we're the bride he is washed us he's brought us to him we didn't have to be virgin born we're the bride we're Washed by the Water of the word amen so the bride the bridegroom was announced in the heavens the bride was announced in the heavens there was an announcement of you coming yes sir now think about What Christmas Means now to Believers the brother SS the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach he said you might not believe that but it's the word just the same and you went through all kinds of chaos and darkness and everything else but one day there has to come a day because you're a seed of God brother Daniel one day there had to be a cry one day there has to be a birth yes sir and there's something inside of I got to go back to church I got to find myself under of the altar you you've all experienced that one day you said I've got to do what the word says I got to start living for God there's something in your life begin to drive you begin to pull you against your better judgment what was it God had announced your birth you had to be born at a certain time bride had to be here at the end time and I believe and this is why it gives me such great hope I know there there's maybe hundreds a dozens at least of people in this area maybe grew up in church we're in a message Church know about the message of the hour and I believe many of them maybe maybe you say well they weren't seated they wouldn't have left I don't necessarily say that's true amen I believe there there's backsliders out there's people out there that that that God's going to get a hold of I believe it's coming it's not because I said it it's not because I'm a I'm a good preacher or a bad preacher has nothing to do with it it doesn't have anything to do with this church or us or anything else what does it have to to do with it's God he announced her approach and before the time of the end every seed of God has got to come to maturity it's got to come to maturity oh we shouldn't stress about our kids we shouldn't worry so much about them don't you realize you've got to come to maturity young people don't get discouraged you've got to come to maturity God's going to bring you through your trials he's going to bring you through your troubles he's going to bring you through the the the hard times he's going to bring you through Temptation he's going to bring you through those times why because he announced your birth sir oh we ought to believe it today brother Brandon says what's happening he said friends the church is coming forth oh my God is going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she is predestinated God said so he would have it that makes it right he said who is a member I don't know I'm trusting trting to be myself I'm trusting you a member but he's going to have a body without spot or wrinkle and I believe that these latterday signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together to show that Christ is ready to come for this bride as God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so is God and His word coming again and making himself manifested in a bride that's very simple that's what we call the bride coming of Christ it's not that we don't believe in a literal coming of Christ but the bride coming of Christ is him coming in you in the fullness of the word amen him being born in you amen he said God he said not only not will do like Eve did HB it to something else but the unadulterated word of God will be borned into that church and she will stand like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit anointing in his word he said I believe it's the announcement now oh how many could believe that today I know it's Christmas Eve but how many I hope it stirs your heart this morning how many can believe I believe it's the announcement you talked about civilization coming from east to west the gospel had to go back from the West to the east he said the same sun when as far west as it could go he said it had to go back East the same sun shining oh my the same Sun that Shone in the Eastern people had to shine on the western people he said to what ripen the seed that's been planted to bring forth a bride the evening light of the Gospel will bring forth a bride amen for the Lord Jesus that ought to give us great hope today it's not dependent on men it's not dependent on pastors it's not dependent on Ministry God will use them God will use men God will use this church but it's not dependent on us there a prophecy he announced it in the heavens he would have a church oh my you see that why the devil tried to keep me up all night and couldn't sleep you want me to say this today but I want you to know I want you to understand God announced your birth the cry was a sign of life and I believe this babies have got to be born into the kingdom until we leave this earth because if they'd all been born we'd already be gone that's right there's got to be at least one left I believe there's more Jesus was wasn't born though full grown right had to grow up you ever think about that like he could have just appeared yeah and just been a full grown man but God didn't do it that way he did it the same way he does with you a baby is born right and you can't be too hard on yourself in that baby stage in fact Jesus leaves the house at a rather Advanced age 33 30 years of age it begins his ministry first 30 years you we find him at 12 in the temple that's the only sign we have during that time that he's even who he says he is so he was not born full grown 1 Peter 1:18 says tells us this for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things a silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you sir who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit to unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently it's one of the signs you've been born again is you love the Brethren that's righten he says being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass all the glory of man as a flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever I'm so glad so my birth is not by corruptible seed because the word of the Lord it was of the word it was a birth of the word and the word of the Lord endures forever it may take me a while to reach my maturity but in during this time I cannot fall back I will not die I can't come on church I may I may look like I'm I'm going downhill but I can't go downhill I'm not going to go to hell Satan can't have me why because I was pre-ordained I was I'm a Son of God or you're a daughter of God you belong to God you've been prophesied over the the heavens announced your birth yes sir Hallelujah hey amen he said and the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you wherefore laying aside all malice and all G hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes you've got to go through that stage he said desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious Jesus grows up and he comes back to Nazareth a full grown man but I want you to watch what he did grows up in Nazareth he leaves he comes back Luke 4:16 he come to nazareth's where had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day stood up for to read he went to church Jesus had a habit of going to church if he had a cell phone it have said so many miles to church this morning cuz it was his Habit to go it still is his Habit to go to church amen but you glad he meets with us here amen you glad he can meet with you anywhere but he's promised where two or three are gathered together I will be in their midst amen he said there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me now he doesn't find Isaiah 7 where his birth he doesn't come on and say Hees find the place in Isaiah where it's written a virgin shall conceive cuz that promise had already been fulfilled right but now he had to stand up and begin to speak and what was he going to say he wasn't going to point him back to his birth but he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor yes sir he has sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day yes oh church this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears what was he saying he said I'm not just a baby in a Manger anymore but today the anointing is upon me I've grown up and I'm speaking yes The Voice of God now could be understood and we know this happened in in brother brandom's Ministry we we realize that this same thing happened and it showed that a son had come to maturity God had brought his Prophet to a place of maturity but we recognize that brother brandham doesn't exist outside of the Bride right right brother brandom is a part of the Bride how many understand that I've heard that preach recently and I think it's brother Wayne Lawson preached that but it's a very valid point brother Brandman exists within the bride yes right he doesn't exist separate from the bride right so when when when he come to maturity when he stood up and took his book and and and and remember the priest handed him his book and he read and he preached birth pains he come back later and preach this day this scripture is fulfilled what was God showing there was a member of the Bride that had come to maturity that was no longer just an infant bride but there was at least one that had come all all the way into maturity that could speak but listen to me he won't be the last one that's right Amen to come to maturity and that's why I don't believe he has to come back for the third pole to be manifested in his fullness I do not believe that brother brandham has to come back to this Earth at all to manifest one word of God he did what he was sent to do that's right and we are doing what we were sent to do and today we stand in the pulpit and we preach the word of God and we say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears brother Bram told us in that sermon he told us this thing in this day the scripture is fulfilled he said now but in this day sir he didn't just say there's to come a prophet there was to come a prophet and there came a prophet but he said in this day there is to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what it'd be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her oh my an announcement of an infant bride and now a bride who will come on the scene and say this day oh God I'm closing Now list look there had to come an infant bride but she couldn't remain in infancy she had to grow up yes amen we live in an age people don't want to grow up they want to be a kid forever that's not what we are or who we are we are people called to maturity we are a people called not to be an infant in a Manger not to be an infant bride but to be we recognize our birth we can see what our birth was but we don't Point people back to that we point to the word of God living today amen oh God what does the word say he said Revelation 19:7 is a prophecy of our hour let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready I don't know about you but I'm ready to walk out Brother David and stand before the people and say this day this scripture is fulfilled I wonder how many of you could say that this morning this day this scripture is fulfilled I've had my struggles I've been through I've been through the trials I've been through the struggle but Satan couldn't have me he couldn't grab a hold of me he didn't get me this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears this day the voice of the Bride will be the fin final voice to the final age do you believe it this morning this day she spoke as an infant she cried as an infant but no one could understand what she was saying but today we understand what what what happened today we take the book sir right Oh my he had to take the book and we've got to take the book John had to take the book A Silent Night broken by a shout the voice of the Archangel The Trumpet Of God this day this scripture all right is fulfilled there is a bride on the earth she has made herself ready do you believe it let's bow our heads together musicians would come if you've
