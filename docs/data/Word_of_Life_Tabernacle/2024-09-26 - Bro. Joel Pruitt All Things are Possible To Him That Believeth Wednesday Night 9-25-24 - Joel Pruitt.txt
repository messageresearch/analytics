tonight Lord and Lord May there not be a doubt in the minds or the hearts of the Believers that leave this building I pray Lord that you would especially help those Lord that couldn't make it tonight Lord Jesus and Lord I pray you would go right to where they are whether they're sick Lord Lord whatever the case would be I pray Lord you would raise them up heal them and Lord For Your Glory and Honor we ask all these things in jesus' name amen amen how many how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen it's good to see each one of you again and be back with you uh don't forget to be praying for the meetings there in Galina we want to say we appreciate brother Ben beard and the church there U just because of uh they support our meeting so well and so uh brother Ben thought it was important for him to go up and and support them as well and so we want to just continue to remember them in prayer and uh I believe there'll be a baptism on Sunday so brother Ben will be back for that and brother Stuart will be speaking also amen so just keep those services in prayer but if you have your Bibles James chapter 2 verse 19 James chapter 2 and verse 19 say Amen when you get it amen amen thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble and if you go to Mark chapter 19 and we'll start with verse 17 Mark chapter 19 and 17 and one of the multitudes answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teth him and he foth and eth with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not he anth him and saith oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child and often times it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou cast do anything have compassion on us and help us and Jesus saith unto them unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word tonight I want you to notice there on the first scripture that the devil actually believes but he trembles at the word of God can you say Amen and so then in Mark Jesus makes a statement if thou can't believe all things are possible so you'll find there is two different types of believing when you say you're you say I believe the message that's good you say I believe in I I believe that I'm going to get home tonight that's good but it's easier to say that when you have a pocket full of money and it's a lot harder to have faith when you don't have any money and but you've got to believe from your heart you've got to believe there's got to be a faith that is a deep settled uh Faith from the heart it can't just be a an intellectual Faith because intellectual Faith might tell you when everything's going right yes I believe when intellectual faith will tell you you know hey everything's going great in my house because I've got a good job and a nice car and and we're able to go to church and and we've got the money to go to church but when when when you go through a challenge are you still able to go are you still able to or you know there's all kinds of challenges that can hit you it can be Health it can be it can be a job it can be it can be your kids maybe they backslide but even in those moments can you still reach down deep and find a faith that is a sustaining Faith Can you say Amen tonight amen and uh in in James uh chapter James chapter 2 and verse 17 uh he's talking about faith with faith without works is dead and he goes on down in the 17th verse and says even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone so your faith will have an action can you say Amen faith will have an action and so the devil believes but the devil doesn't act on his faith the devil believes I mean he believes every word of the message he believes every word of the Bible he knows it's true because he's been cast down the devil knows how the devil believes better than anybody in the building tonight but there's one thing he cannot do and that's act on the word of God can you say Amen so tonight what we're doing is we're not just trying to find an intellectual faith and you walk out of here and it's a health wealth and prosperity message that says well you know what I'm going to have money in the bank my bills are going to be paid all these things are going to be great but what you've got to do is when it's going bad when the bad times are coming well come on somebody when you can't pay your bills and it looks like there's no light at the end of the tunnel you can still say I believe that God is and God's word still holds true regardless of what the circumstances look like now brother Brandon would say like this now Faith is not based upon the shifting Sands of man's ideas you just he said if I come here and told you there was an angel the Lord that was in the building and all these things happening if you didn't have something to prove that to you you'd have a right to doubt it but he said God gave a gift to do a certain thing and You' seen it come right back around and fail he said you'd say that's wrong but when it comes back and God proves it every time to be perfect then that's right God has proved to be true God has proven it now faith has to have a resting place and if you were going to get married he said some of you young men or or young women to get married he said then you'd have to have faith on who you would marry you'd have to have faith if you're a man you have to have faith in the woman you're marrying you believe she's going to be a good wife you believe she's going to be a good mother you don't go in blindly thinking well this might work out or it might not work out no you've got a faith in that person or you've got faith where you go to church you believe the Pastor's going to feed you you believe the pastor's got your best interest in mind see these are all things that you have to have faith to believe in can you say Amen but when you lose your faith many times we lose our faith in the valley but remember brother brand teaches us in the valley is where the Lily grows well can you say Amen it's not on the mountain top the Mountaintop experiences are fun and the Mountaintop experiences are nice but often times you do your most growing when you're in the valley often times you realize who you are and you get down to business with God and say Lord I you cry out to God I'll tell you it's a lot harder to pray when you don't need something but when you need something from God then you're down on your knees begging God to do something why because you have to reach down to the heart faith and say Lord I need more of you Lord I need I I don't have any money in the bank and I need more of you I need you to provide all my needs and if you really believe he is more than able to do that why because he said he could provide all your needs he said you would never beg for bread he said you would you would make it well come on somebody he said you wouldn't lose one of your children but you've got to have faith to believe it and it's got to be more than an intellectual Faith now we go a little deeper in this intellectual Faith here and the intellectual faith is what the devil has the intellectual faith is what many Christians have can you say Amen the intellectual faith is something that that like I said when everything's going good intellectual faith is easy to have intellectual Faith doesn't challenge anything then every this is the way the church is are going we're just going to be this kind of a Christian because intellectually we believe that this must be right but if you ever get Faith In Your Heart then it may be a challenge to you and it may actually God may let you go through some things but when you come out on the other side you'll realize your faith was holding you the whole time now think back to the widow woman there in the Bible when Elijah comes to her and she only has a little bit of meal left in the barrel and just a little bit of Cru a little Cru of oil left and that's all she's got but she's willing to give that up because she believes God will provide sir now if she didn't believe God would provide she would just go ahead and eat that and at least have one final meal but what she believed was this is the man of God standing here asking for something and I'm going to give everything I've got to him well come on somebody I'm going to give up everything I've got I might not be able to live my son might not be able to live but if God can send a man of God to your front door then God is able to put meal in the barrel God is able to put oil in the Cru God is more than why because of faith that woman had to act on something now she could say I believe this is a prophet of God I I believe this word that he come and told me I believe I believe but she had to prove her faith with her actions can you say amen and that's what we're going to have to do many times if you go through life and you start saying well I believe I believe God's going to prove that Faith God's going to make you prove that Faith God's going to put you through something and see if you'll stay with it yeah well can you say Amen God's going to challenge you at some point remember job was a man who was perfect and upright and yet God would challenge him and allow Satan to put put him through all kinds of things why because it was a trial of his faith and that trial of your faith is more precious than gold tried in the fire and if you'll ever take that scripture and look into the gold and and in the med Medieval Times what they would do with that gold is they would beat it and the the the beater would actually beat that gold until he he could see his reflection in it and many times God is doing that to us he's he's beating that gold he's trying to get all the draw off of you he's trying to make you gold he's trying to make you something but you've got to go through a trial to get there you've got to go through tests after test and every son that comes to God must be tested and TR and tried can you say Amen tonight so we don't believe that this is just a flowery bed of ease we don't believe that just this is just a picnic and all the quotes you've heard on that we don't believe that this is just going to be easy but we will be tried we will be tested but we will overcome can you say Amen we are more than than able brother Rand says it like this the only solid resting place for faith is on God's word how many can say Amen to that God's word is a solid rock any faith that anybody wants to have in the Supernatural it must be placed first in the word of the Living God now how he said how it's been through the age how that when men of old in all ages when they would really find the word of God and could grasp it Faith went into action right away and brother brandom uses Noah as an example here Noah would stand there and preach sermon after sermon and he PR preach the same sermon with the same title after the same title and the same sermon and no doubt that would drive people away in itself because Mo Noah you need to come up with some new content you need to tell us what we want to hear and yet he was telling them what God had already told him to say well come on somebody there there the congregation was sitting there week after week thinking Noah we wish you'd preach on this and we wish you'd preach on that well God was giving him the word of the Lord and he was preaching exactly what God wanted to warn them about and yet they just couldn't be satisfied with it why because they just didn't really believe the message he was preaching was from God but had they really believed they'd have been in the ark on the opening day I mean they'd have been there they'd have been the first person waiting why because we've heard the word of the Lord now we're acting on the word of the Lord and they they would have been saved but see what happens is as you say oh I believe in I believe in this and I believe I believe there could be a flood but we'll just wait and see what happens no the word is going to come true with or without you you might as well get on the ark now and so what you'll find is there's all kinds of doubters there's all kinds of people that says well it's not raining yet and there's all kinds of people that would say well I I just wish something would happen to show me that God is real well God has already sent you a sign in your time you either Believe it or you don't can you say Amen God's already Vindicated himself through a prophet you either Believe it or you don't God already send a message he would send one to an age and the people of the age would either Believe it or they would reject it but I'm glad tonight to be associated with believers who will say Amen to everything a prophet said we're not backing down from it we're not scared of it we're not going to lay down and say well the Ley and age is here and this didn't happen and and you know maybe the prophecies will fail no the prophecies are coming hold on to the word of the Lord for your day hold on to the word that has been preached because sometime or another it's going to rain sir can you say Amen now brother Brandon would go on down and he would say now so many revivals are going across the country and people are claiming to be saved and great evangelist saying they had so many thousands saved and so forth he said I believe it's when you go back and find out those people don't stay they just it's just an emotion in the meeting and a worked up meeting many people in the meeting raise up and claim healing and walk away more by emotion more by psychic than they do by real divine revelation of the Lord Jesus and so the first little pain strikes them and they give up and say well I didn't get my healing now if you really believe that with your heart 10,000 and pains would never make you give up well can somebody say Amen tonight it don't matter how you feel it's what his word already said if he said you're healed you're healed if he said the bills are paid the bills are paid well come on somebody and you say well that's that's health wealth and prosperity preaching I'm just going to tell you right now God is not willing that any should perish and he's not willing that you should go hungry he is not willing that you should lose a child he is not willing to see you suffer but if you'll trust him he'll never leave you down there but he'll raise you up as pure he'll raise you up so that you can put food on your table he'll raise you up and give you the job you need sir can you say Amen sir but when one little thing goes wrong we give up but if God's word is promised to provide for you you don't ever give up no matter how bad the how tough it gets or how bad the situation gets now brother R would go on down he said 10,000 pains will never make you give up that's right because your faith has already went into motion and you're in action right then now brother BR goes on down he said when God spoke to Noah and told him the impossible he said there was no rain never had rain never was a cloud in the sky or anything else but Noah knew that it was going to rain because God said so imagine Noah standing there he's having to explain what rain is because they had never rained before he's having to explain to these people this is what's going to happen and water's going to cover the Earth and there had never been rain they had never even seen a cloud they had never even seen an evidence that this word could take place well can you say Amen now he said now he said said what you'll find is most always when you find people that'll dare to take God at his word they're considered neurotics or Fanatics and the real True Believer has never had the world to Pat him on the back it's always been against him because he takes God at his word and God has never been a friend to the world in the way of the world being a friend of God he said they're against God because they can't understand God and you'll never know God Only By Faith Can you say Amen but Noah he moved with he moved with the fear of God knowing that there was coming a destruction and so he built the ark now there's an action to Noah's Faith Noah could preach about it Noah could talk about it but he had to put his faith into action can you say Amen it's one thing to talk about the message but it's another thing to live the message if you believe the message you're going to put it into action well can you say Amen now because God's word has got to be has got to be applied to our lives it's it's one thing to and I this is my background so I'll talk about it it's one thing to press play and say I obey I do this and but but the very fact that you're not preaching the gospel and you're called to preach tells me you're not obeying what the voice is saying so what You' got to do is take what you've heard and put it into action I I believe in here in the tapes but don't just let it be a letter but let the spirit Quicken it to somebody and take this message and preach the gospel to the people I say it's time we raise up and quit letting the devil keep us down and putting us down in second place when where we belong is in the heavenlies believing that God will do the miraculous believing that God's going to heal and he's going to save why because his word has already promised to do it and all we have to do is just believe because if you can believe from the heart all things are possible now intellectual faith will never do that intellectual faith will never heal you intellectual faith will never save you intellectual faith will not hold you in the time in the in the time of of Trials but but God's faith in the heart will holds you thanks for the amen sir but brother BR would go on down like this he said little group in here tonight a little group tonight he said it makes no difference how it looks don't reason it can you say Amen don't reason it it makes no difference it don't reason if you've only got intellectual faith you'll reason God's word you'll try to reason it see now let me see now the doctor said I can't get well and if the doctor said so that ought to settle it that's reason Faith don't reason Faith believes it anyhow well your cancer was stage one now it's stage two thank God I'm Healed your your cancer was stage three now it's stage four I tell you we've got a testimony in this day of cancer not taken yet when the doctor says so look at brother Ron Spencer and you see that the man's still preaching the gospel and he should have been dead several years ago but I'm going to tell you right now God is still God and he's more than able to hold a man with cancer he's more than able when God's through with him God will take him home but until then there's not a devil of cancer there's not a stroke there's not a demon Out of Hell there's not a car accident nothing can take you until God is done with you can you say amen so we've got to have faith you say well so and so died with this disease it was their time to go but I'm going to tell you right now if it's not your time just believe and God will take care of you I'm not saying people don't die but I'm saying this that if you have faith if you can't believe all things are possible if you need to be healed God's already healed you if you need more uh if you need more of the Holy Ghost to need a refilling I believe there's more for you before there was ever a Fin on the fish's back there had to be water for to swim in but I want to say tonight we've got to have faith that God has created you in such a time as this and he has put the right DNA in place so that you could withstand the the times that you're living in and you would be a believer in this time you're not sitting in a Baptist Church for a reason you're not sitting in the Methodist Church for a reason you're not sitting down here in the nightclubs and the bars for a reason sister Stephanie God brought you back for a reason and God will hold you because God is more than able to raise up children out of stones themselves listen God will use whatever he wants God will do whatever he wants all we've got to do is believe it because all things are possible somebody say all things all things so you put you put a name on your problem and it's possible that God's going to take care of it I'd say it's more than possible i' say it's already done if your faith can match up to it so we go on down here and uh you've heard you've heard testimonies before people say well I'm going to I'm going to lose my house or I'm going to lose my Electric's going to get and somebody walk after the mailbox and a checks there I know these things kind of become oldfashioned and we don't really believe them anymore but you know it's still true you know God still more than able to do that God's still more than able to work on on one end down here to provide a need for somebody over here God is more than able when did we quit believing God God never quit doing Miracles God never give up on us why would we give up on God can you say Amen there's no reason for it there's no reason for us to start doubting God when it gets tough because every man that comes listen we've already got proof that that that people are going to go through trials Jesus himself would go through trials but in the end listen the devil couldn't hold him down what can you say amen and if that same spirit that raised up him from the dead dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal body well come on somebody I tell you if you really knew who you were if you knew you were a Son of God if you knew you were a daughter of God then let me just go ahead and tell you not a devil in hell can stop you from receiving every promise that is in the book now brother bandam said if you've only got a mental conception of the Bible you say well I believed it because I read it God's got to reveal it to you now remember brother bandam teaches that faith is a revelation can you say Amen Faith you've got to you've got to know that it really is you can't just think it is you can't think it's going to be okay you got to believe from your heart that it's going to be okay and he said well I believe it because I read it and God but God's got to reveal it to you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the holy spirit let me just go ahead and tell you tonight you want to know how a lot of our our doubts be solved get the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you could receive the Holy Ghost you say well I receive the Holy Ghost but I'm still struggling I say get a baptism again and baptism after baptism refilling after refilling don't ever stop and be be be be you say well I'm just I'm okay because I received it no don't stop at your first feeling but go on into the blessings of God and receive after receive and because God wants to give you more of him every time you come to the house of God God doesn't want you to set there with worry God doesn't want you to sit there with a frown on your face well can you say man God doesn't want you to sit there and be worried about the bills coming to tomorrow no God wants you to be like little children and live happy before him well come on somebody God knows what you're going through and he's already got a solution for you if you'll just believe that God still works in Mighty ways we've given up on God we've let God we've we've let worry take the place of faith and and if you let worry take the place of faith and well I tell you what's going to happen you're going to worry yourself into a sickness and brother Brandon would say worry caused disease and worry could cause cancer and worry can cause all these things you say well I'm just so worried I say don't worry just believe and I know you say well brother Joel do you ever wor oh yes that devil will come by every day the devil's going to come by and and he's going to he's going to let you get in the Blues sometimes and he's going to try to tell you that God doesn't really heal but let me tell you something many times we think of those thoughts coming to us as evil thoughts sometimes it's just a doubt that comes to us you don't have to let that doubt rest in your mind because what you do is you cast the doubts out by the hearing of the word cast the doubts out by saying devil go back to hell where you come from you don't even have the keys to your own house you've been stripped of them and I believe that God is going to take care of every situation in my life I don't know who this is for but I'm going to tell you right now I think it's time we quit giving way to the devil we let the devil tell us this and tell us what we're going through and and the Devil comes around and he'll tell you yeah you're going through a hard time and it it may not get any better for you and you know you may not be able to pay them bills and the devil is like job's comforter well you know it's just everything's falling apart for you you might as well Curse God did you ever think that that's the time when you need to really believe did you ever think that when you're going through I'm just going to say it when you're going through the worst time in your life and you say well I believe the message I believe the message I say that's God trying to prove that you really believe what you say you believe God wants to know are you really a Believer well come on somebody you say well he already knows but he wants to show the devil whose side you're really on resist the devil and he'll flee far from you I believe that he'll flee far away so what you say is this you say well brother Brandon would say like this if you've really based your faith on God's Eternal Word and it's down in your heart all Devils out of Torment can't upset you well well we could read that again if you've really if you've really based your faith on God's Eternal Word and it's down in your heart now it's not just on the page but it's in the heart and if it's in the heart all Devils out of Torment can't upset you and somebody ought to say Amen to that because we get upset and we get mad and sometimes we lash out because things are going our way that's the devil tormenting you but if you just believe God's word get it off the letter get it off the tape and put it in your heart then God can really go to work in that heart then because it's a man with faith it's a man that believes that whatever you have for me Lord I'm willing to take it if it's I tell you what if it's a trial then take me through the trial because I know that I'm not going to lose in the trial but you've already seen the other side of it and I'm coming out as pure gold I say he's not going to leave you because it's in the valley where he restores your soul he's not going to leave you in the valley he'll bring you back up when you need to let me tell you something God is going to give you something more than you can handle he's going to let he knows how far you can go he said you can't take job's life he can't take your life listen he may let all hell break loose on you but he'll never take your life let me tell you something you say well he could take my children he took job's children but he restored everything back to him and I believe in a god of restoration I believe in a god of healing I believe in a God that can that can provide for somebody who needs money in the bank I believe in it I believe with all my heart that we serve a Living God I believe that we are not just talking about a living God but we know that he's real we've seen the signs we've seen the vindications we've heard the voice we know who he is but it's time to put that in action and not leave it in 1947 not leave it in 1963 but it's time to take it off the tape and take it off the Bible listen let's Lift Jesus out of history and make him a living God in a living body on the Earth today I believe that we are the ones that can do it we are the bride of Christ listen no other church is sitting out on a 7:00 on a Wednesday night and and just saying that we are the bride of Christ listen I'm going to tell you what they're doing they're sitting down they're telling well if you can do this if you can jump through this hoop and you can speak in tongues like this or or or maybe they've canceled Church all together because they don't really see the importance of it but let me just go ahead and tell you you've come here because you believe the word of God that said assemble yourselves together and so you've acted on the word by coming to church on a Wednesday night you act on the word by going to church on a Sunday morning well can you say amen you've acted on the word now God is obligated to back up his word here tonight can you say amen Amen brother bam said it like this I'm gonna skip on down here because I didn't set my timer somebody said oh oh help him Lord yes well I'm watching the clock so we'll be okay maybe and he said what if Pharaoh would have looked into the word of God he would have changed his attitude towards Moses oh think about it think about about it sir if Pharaoh would have just looked into the word of God he would have changed his attitude he would have changed his attitude and he said the rest of the Israelites if he'd have looked into the word and see where God promised by his word he was going to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt he would have done it he would have changed his attitude towards the people but he was so busy he went to church sure a very religious man so going to church is not enough we can all agree on that right he said a very religious man Pharaoh went to church I didn't know that thankful for a prophet he went to church a very religious man and he went to church and he was a what you call a mental believer he said and so he said he had uh whatever you want to call it he had knowledge of what he was doing in the mental way but to have a real Revelation that God was going to keep that word if he have had that he wouldn't have acted towards Moses the way he did now going down where he talks about Moses he said in Moses's faith did not rest upon what he could do with the biggest army in the world it didn't rest on what he could do sitting on Pharaoh's Throne as a pharaoh his faith rested upon what thus sayith the Lord had said now you think about it Moses could have just been pharaoh and we would have never had the testimony of being delivered out of the hand of pharaoh on well come on somebody if if Moses would have just done his job and set on the throne and been the next Pharaoh then they would have never reached the promised land because he would have been content with where he was there would have been nothing to run him away from there it would have been nothing to try him out and see if he was really going to be the man for the job but what happened was God knew that he was not going to be able to stay there all his education could not keep Moses in Egypt all the education could not prepare him for the battles that would be ahead all of the Educational Systems could not bind Moses to Egypt but what it was it was faith that the word of God was in his heart and that Faith was down there he was already appointed he was predestinated for a time to where he would be a leader of Israel and and Moses would have to actually come out of this land and go over the Jordan and he would have to come out but he had to come out in a way that would seem impossible to the people he would have to show God to be true because these people were going to be in the wilderness for a really long time and so they had to see something in the in in the beginning to know that we are following a real prophet and so that's what I look at that as the first Po and the second pool of brother Brand's Ministry there had to be something to catch the people's attention can you say Amen there had to be something that it would say well let me let me see what this man's got to say let me see what this prophet's got to say there had to be something to get the people's attention so that they would follow this man because God has always done it that way God had a pillar of fire with Moses and God had a pillar of fire in our day can you say Amen we're not following just another man we're not following another faith healer we're not following another evangelist what we're following is the prophet of God Vindicated by the same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses that was with Paul and that was all down through the age listen it is the same God doing the same Works among his people he will not leave you in Egypt but he has provided a way for you to come out though Pharaoh's Army was closing in though Pharaoh's Army looked like they would overtake him there was a god there that would that would blind the enemy and would deliver his children Time After Time After Time and even when they get to the promised land they would get there and the first thing they get to is they see walled cities and and there's Giants there and and you know what Caleb would stand up and say give me my Mountain well come on somebody Caleb believed that God was more than able he brought me out of Egypt he brought me through all the years in the wilderness if God could do that God can take out these Giants if God could bring you here if he could save you from The Sinner you were then God is more than able to take care of you on the journey called life sir we look back and we forget what God's done for us it's good to look back sometimes and give God some praise for what he's done for us you know a new Christian a lot of times is on fire for God you know why because they realize what God has done for them but he woke you up this morning and he started you on your way you might as well give God thanks for that too you might as well say you know what I'm glad I'm not in the denomination but I'm flying free in the heavenlies why we ought to we ought to give God thanks for that we ought to give God thanks that we can still Gather in a church building like this and believe that God's word is being preached across the pulit we're not here to see a man we're not here just to just to feel good but what we're here to do is give God the glory because you brought me from a mighty long way you brought me from sin you brought me from all kinds of doubt and unbelief and I'll say this you brought me from just being a hearer only to endure also the word of God God is more than able to save souls and and save people from from an early grave God is still God can you say Amen but what we've done is we forgot where he brought us from and so we don't believe he can take us on well the church can say Amen sorry I got to pull for some amens on a Wednesday night don't make me do all the work you say well I don't like it well you can say Amen to the quotes here we go Moses would have take Taking Pharaoh's Throne it he said he said it wouldn't have been God's word and so it goes on down here for time's sake let's get on down here he said he said it's no good to you if you won't put Faith he said it don't matter how much Faith you've got if you won't use it it's no good to you he said that's right what what good is a god of Moses if he ain't the same God today what good well come on somebody what good is a god of William brandom if he's not the same God today what good is a God that was with Paul and struck him down on the road to Damascus if he's not the same God today what good is a historical God we can talk about him we can say how great he was it's it's kind of like talking about the president well Abraham Lincoln or or we can go a little bit newer we can go Ronald Reagan or or we'll stop there and you can say all kinds of things that how good the presidents were listen it don't matter if you're looking in the past that's not going to bring that's not going to do anything for you we've got to look to the future we got to know that the same God that work in is the same God that's going to work today and he's the same God that's going to work tomorrow and no matter how dark the world gets and how bad the world gets or how divided politics get it's not going to have one effect on the believer why because we're not here of this world we're not here we're not we're not we're our kingdom dwellers of this world but we're from a kingdom above can you say Amen we are more than able to keep on keeping on in this day because we're not looking here and we're not looking there and we're not looking at the plagues that are coming we're not looking at the bombs that are going to fall we're not worried about the wars that are happening that's just prophecy being fulfilled in our day that ought to give the believer that much more faith that God is still doing what he promised to do we just got to believe you say well I turn on the news and I get scared a Believer won't get scared a Believer don't turn on the news and get scared believer don't turn on the news no a Believer don't turn on the news and get scared but a Believer will look at that and say wars and rumors of wars that's prophecy being fulfilled earthquakes in diverse places that's prophecy being fulfilled sometimes you might shout a little bit when you're watching Fox because you see how bad it's getting and you realize how close we are well can you say Amen brother Bram said you people who go to church that's all of you tonight he said and your church only teaches he never mind you people that go to a denominational church but if you went to this church say you go to this church and if we only get up here and teach that some historical fact about the Holy Ghost coming back on the day of Pentecost we can tell you about how it fell on Paul we can tell you how it fell on the 120 we can tell you how it fell all down through every person in the Bible there we can tell you how it fell and and we can talk about we can talk about coming right up into the the 1906 Pentecost we can tell you how it fell then and we can bring you out of Pentecost and show you how it fell in the message and if you don't bring it to this day you're talking about a historical God now we believe in looking back and seeing what God has done but if we don't believe it's the same God it didn't do you no good to look back what can you say Amen so we we've got to believe that God is more than just a historical God we cannot get to heaven and we're never going to make a Rapture on intellectual Faith because there's no proof of a Rapture intellectually there's no proof that there was a pillar fire with Moses intellectually there's no proof well come on somebody there's no proof that there was a cloud that back in with Moses up on the mountain there was no proof that God came down and wrote the Ten Commandments on a couple rocks there's no proof of that intellectually but we believe there's proof because it's in our hearts and it's written on our hearts and there's nothing there's no devil in hell that can take that out of our hearts why because we believe everything in the word is true now we've had some proof and we believe in the proof and that has gotten our attention but now we have become one with the word and there's nothing that can make us doubt that the word is true there's nothing that makes me doubt that job's story is true there there's nothing that can make me doubt that there was really three Hebrew boys that went into a fiery furnace and they come out alive listen nothing can make me doubt that because I believe the word of God is still true and I don't believe any devil in hell can ever cause me to Fall Away in this end time I like what the brother said at Camp I believe it's brother Josh Bennett he said we can fall down but we can't fall away we can fall down but we can't fall away we're going to make mistakes but we can't fall away you're going to fall down a lot of times but you cannot fall away there's all kinds of devils going to come after you there's going to be times when you don't feel like it there's going to be times when you don't feel saved there's going to be time well come on somebody there's going to be times when you feel like throwing your hands up and quitting but God is still God and if you'll just believe that what he did he's still doing and what he's doing he's going to keep on doing there's no reason to fear cancer there's no reason to fear heart trouble there's no reason to fear all these things why because God is still doing great things can you say Amen brother B would say it like this he said he said it wouldn't do you no more good he said to believe in George Washington once lived he said that's right Abraham Lincoln wouldn't do you no good to believe that they once lived according to history he said if he said but if they're dead and buried according to history wouldn't do you no good to believe that if you can't believe that those works could continue on and that party or whatever it was if there was not somebody to carry on that that that party's work or or or to do what them men could do today you have to believe that God still uses men you have to still believe that God still has a purpose for every one of us and you have to believe that it wasn't just for them but it's also for us and it wasn't just good enough for the 120 but I believe if there's 50 people sitting here on Hardy on a Wednesday night I would say that that same Holy Ghost can come down on us can you say amen I believe if we would just wait on him and quit getting in such a hurry and say well well I need to be out of here in five minutes let me go and tell you something I'm not going to hold you long but I'm GNA tell you we need to get so serious with God that we would be like buddy Robinson I'm just have the faith that I'm G to stay right here and this is where I'm going to get the Holy Ghost and Lord if you don't come you're going to find a pile of bones but I'm going to tell you if you ever get that serious God knew if he was serious and he came down and gave him the Holy Ghost let me go ahead and tell you something if you get serious with God and Believe from your heart then God will do the impossible and make it work in your situation you say well well you just don't see how bad it is for me listen I don't but he does I may not know what you're going through but we have a God who is more than able to take care of your situation he can walk down every aisle in this building and he knows exactly what's in your heart Brother David he knows exactly what's wrong in the family he knows exactly what's wrong in your in your work situation he knows exactly what's wrong with our young people and what they need but listen to me God is still more than able to walk down every aisle and touch every person I may not be able to do it but he can because God is more than enough can you say Amen God's more than enough sir amen what we need today brother is some real genuine Faith put into action can you say Amen we need real faith and Men Who dare to put God's word to their heart and apply it to themselves he said you try to apply it to the generation gone by but the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's forever God he never fails he's the same in principle he's the same in power can you say Amen he's the same tonight that he was when he walked on well come on somebody he's the same tonight as when he was here physically walking on Earth and he said he appears nightly on the platform and proves himself alive from the dead he said you don't have to take any history about it it's right now present time fact and we see it you realize how much faith that we ought to have in this age because we've actually seen prophecy fulfilled and we've actually seen the scriptures come to life and we've actually seen listen i' I I've actually talked to a man and and there was there was many witnesses there down in Florida and and he was I talked to the man just recently on the phone and he was dead he died once in the meeting and they revived him and got him back he goes they take him into a room he dies again and he's dead for a while there's nurses there there's no pulse there's nothing by the time the ambulance get there they had prayed for the the man and the next thing you know he comes back up again listen I'm going to tell you a dead man that was raised twice in the same service I guess it wasn't his time and that was 20 years ago 20 years ago but that same God that was there is the same God here tonight but the only reason we don't see him is because we're not believing for it but if you'll just believe for well if my church did this or if the preacher would do this no it's you it's you it's you and God and you've got to get that heart so right with God that that you it's nothing between you and the Savior nothing nothing can stop you from loving him nothing can stop you from believing him nothing can stop you not even doubt itself can come I'll tell you I heard a brother say it and I'll repeat it he said you got to learn to doubt your doubts well can you say Amen you got to learn to doubt your doubts quit doubting quit quit quit doubting God's word and start doubting your doubts and I mean quit quit telling the devil how good he is and start telling God how real he is well it looks like everything's falling apart but the devil saying yes sir you're exactly right the devil's agreeing with you and the devil just wants you to feel so good about not going to church on a Wednesday night he wants you to feel so good about not going to church he he wants to make it so fun for you but you know when you're really doing the will of God he wants to make it so hard on you he does because the devil also is not happy when you're serving God but what but what you're doing is you're actually when you're when you're being tried and when you're being tested brother Brandon would say it like this he said if the devil's after you it proves he hadn't got you and I would say tonight if the devil's after you you need to praise God that you're still in the race if the devil's on your tail then you just better be singing all as well I tell you it's time we quit giving way to the devil it's time we quit telling the devil well I I I tell you the devil got a hold of me well quit testifying to the devil and start testifying of the goodness of God and all that he's done in your life because he's more than able can you say Amen we'll get way on down here cuz I don't know how much time I've been up here but I think it's been too long and I missed my timer so bad what good is it going to do for you to read of a historical God if he isn't the same God today y'all may miss my timer too if I go over time he said what good is it going to do to read about old George Washington if he's dead and gone see it's just a history fact what good is it going to be doing to talk about Jesus he said but Jesus raised from the dead and he's the same today what good does it do to paint fire to a a to a painted fire to a freezing man show you a picture of a a fire in the winter time and you're freezing to death That Fire won't do you no good well I can see the fire but I can't feel it why because it's not real because you you it's just a painted fire it's just a mirage it's nothing to you it's nothing you you've got to actually get the fire before you can ever feel the fire that that'll do for that'll do for more than one way I tell you you want to feel the fire of God in the church it may start with just you what can you say Amen you say well I wish we could have a service for somebody screams so go right right ahead ain't nobody stopping you I wish we had somebody to run the aisles well I tell you what kick your shoes off and run I wish we had somebody that shout go ahead and shout it ain't going to hurt me a bit I tell you what what we need to do is quit looking at our neighbors say I wish they were spiritual what about me what about me I wish they would give Faith what about me Lord I need more faith I need to quit worrying about what I can't control and start saying you know what whatever you've got for my life I'm just going to walk in your footsteps amen that was all free he said no wonder we got a failure in America of religion no wonder the magazine says the spiritual the spiritual is a is a b is a burst he said because they failed to represent the right thing to them they're trying to teach them of a historical God but what we need today is a god resurrected from the dead and on hand right now can you say Amen to do whatever he promised he would do to confirm his word and we need delegates out there in the audience who's willing to rest their soul on any word of God well can you say Amen to that how many delegates do we have here tonight that means well come on somebody help me out how many delegates do we have here tonight about 75% of you are willing to rest your soul on any word that God says what can you say Amen you are willing so if God says you're already healed you just told me that you're willing to say I'm already healed no matter what the doctor said brother Paul you believe that Brother Paul's had some bad reports but I'm going to just go and tell you right now the man has kept the faith and and only reported only reported Faith to me I'm just going to tell you right now the man's got a lot of faith so what I would say is like this if if the doctor told you today Brother David that you had cancer now you can say okay that's what you say and that's what the devil's tried to put on me but he's already healed me yeah I I I know the devil can put cancer on me but he don't have to stay on me I know the devil can give you diabetes but he don't have to stay on you you I know the devil could I know the devil could cause you to to fall but you don't have to stay down you can get right back up again what can you say amen God is more than able to do everything his word has already said if it's in the word believe it if it's in the word I tell you what I think we need to quit preaching we quit quit preaching the message is something that we got to attain to and start believing that it is something we have now I I tell you the message is not something that we just barely Out Of Reach and we we almost got no the message is something we can live it is something we can get a hold of and we can apply to our lives we don't have to sit there and wonder about what's going to happen tomorrow because we don't know the future but he's got it all in control can you say Amen so brother R would say it like this any word that God said and put it on action any delegates willing to do that he said what we need is men and women who stand up to the Forefront there and call the devil a liar you get up in the morning you don't feel good you call that devil a liar what can you say amen that's not something I said the prophet said to do it somebody's got to stand at the Forefront of this battle and call the devil what he is he's a liar and he has no hold on you he listen he don't even add the keys to his own house he's locked out you're going to believe in a man like that when when when he's been stripped of his rights he has no right over you if you're a Believer the devil has nothing on you you oh somebody ought to just go ahead and get excited here tonight because I'm going to tell you something if you recognize that if you have this faith in your heart all things are possible just believe all things are possible I don't care what the devil's done to you I don't care what your neighbor's done to you I don't care what the preacher done to you all things are possible if you'll just believe well I've been dealt a bad hand it don't matter that's just the devil go ahead and let go of that and say God you you know maybe you know maybe God put you in that situation for a reason sir many times we'll run off when it gets tough but that's not what a Christian does a Christian is going to feel the heat of the battle and he's going to stand there and fight I'm just telling you what a prophet said is that okay because many times we get scared because we think we're out of the will of God because the battle comes and that's not true at all because what if job would have just thrown up his hands and got rid of everything and left the land I mean he could have he could have he could have left all them problems behind him but God had him there for a purpose and it didn't look like it it didn't feel like it for sure but he had him there for a purpose so brother random says it like this and I'll just St my notes for a minute before I close he said what good does it do to have a bird what good does it do for a bird to have wings if you've got him in a cage he can't fly he don't need no wings if you've got him in a cage he said oh that's the way a lot of these people are they're in a cage they're taught the days of Miracles has passed oh there's a God oh yes we believe that Jesus was his son I've accepted him as his personal savior but I tell you all those things is back there in the old days they're passed the days of Miracles has passed what Good's your wings going to do you he said what Good's your faith going to do you if you can't turn it loose come on somebody youve got to turn loose on that faith and say every devil in hell may be after me but I'm on The Winning Side there's not a devil that can catch me I tell you what you might be in this race and you might be trying to attain the finish line and the devil may be hot on your Trail but he cannot catch you he cannot stop you he cannot overtake you why because God has already ordained you for the Finish Line he's already I'll tell you what I tell you I I tell you I feel good right now I just want to preach for a minute that God has already given you the the trophy at the end God has already said he's already rigged the race and you're going to be just a little bit faster than that devil that's after you why because the devil might think it can catch you but God already knew that he couldn't because God would not have put you in a race that the devil could beat you in God would not have put you in this in this age if the devil could take you out God would not have put you in this church tonight if he thought the devil could get a hold of you and keep you in bondage any longer I believe you just need to accept your freedom tonight if you got Wings use them if you got faith use it if you need more of God reach out your hand to God and say I need more of you if you need something from God tonight don't doubt but just believe that God is still God and he's still more than able he's more than able he's not just able to do it but he's more than able sister Stephanie he's more than able he's more than able to go to where brother Bill is tonight and make him feel better he's more than able brother Harold to take care of that leukemia he's more than able to take you out of the situation you're in you say well it looks hopeless to me he's more than able all things are possible all things are possible if you believe all things are possible musicians go ahead and come if you would I want to just close on this one brother brand said brother R said you do something before the devil would tell Jesus if you'll just do this come off of that cross I believe you brother BR said it like this he said he said he said that's where every man he said Jesus would stand there and say Jesus would stand there it's not so and he would go on brother brandham stumbles around here for a minute and he actually changes the situation and goes to he goes to where turn these stones into bread and then Jesus would say Jesus would say it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God there's where his faith was anchored where was his faith anchored in the word does he provide all your needs the word says He does does he heal your body the word says he does does he save your soul the word says he does well I don't have the money to do this the word says it's already done if you just believe can you say am man let's stand to your feet tonight if you would brother brandom said it like this I want to just I just lay this in here we could just for a second Jesus when he was here on Earth he said verily I say unto you I can do nothing in myself I can do nothing but what the father shows me that I do now doubt did not come from this Bible but what he's shown you in the word is that you do not have to doubt what he's already shown you is that if you say to this mountain be thou removed it will move if you have need of something tonight all you have to do is speak use the faith that you've got it's just a grain of a mustard seed use what you got use what you've got and watch that come to pass because we don't have to wait on another Prophet we don't have to wait on another preacher we don't have to wait on someone else to come and and and work us into this it is just a faith in our heart believing that God is God was God is God always will be he's the same yesterday and today and forever we've heard that all of our Lives if you're in the message but at some time in your life it's got to become a reality that he's not just in history but he's now present Among Us can you say amen and brother Brandon would say like this I he said I can do nothing to myself but what the father shows me that I do he said I come to do the will of God and when he went away he said this ministry shall cease now for the very things that I do you will do also so he may not be here in a literal Corporal body tonight but he's here in you he's here in your flesh he's here in human flesh again on the earth as your Pastor T not too long ago he's back in Dusty clothes again he's back again but he's in human flesh he may be hid from the world but you can see because it's been revealed to you by faith that I am Son of God you are a daughter of God you have once been in sin but you're now placed in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus can you say Amen if you have a need tonight as I'm closing brother said the heroes of the Old Testament had Faith they put it into action you've got them for an example aren't you thankful for that he said now we've got faith but you won't put it into action but he said ride away on the powers of the Holy Holy Spirit I wonder if we could do that tonight as we bow our heads if you have a need on your heart tonight I wonder if you just just put your hand up right where you are sometimes I believe we we we live so below our privileges because we want to do something we want to work life out we want to make it when he's already went before us and made a way for us we just got to rest in his promises if you just pray right there where you're at just if you have something just go ahead and talk to the Lord right where you are he hears you he knows every need is more than able heavenly father as you see these people here tonight with their hands raised and their their heads bowed to you Lord there may be many in here who have failed to take you at your word and they've let worry overtake them they've let fear they've let anxieties and depression Lord we live in a time where everything is just against us but Lord You're greater than depression you're greater than anxiety you're greater than just a knowledge you're not an intellectual God but you're a God that we believe by faith and Lord I pray you would raise our faith tonight to where we would just rise up in the power and Lord I pray that you would give us wings like eagles to soar into the heavenlies here tonight and Lord when we leave this building I pray that we wouldn't doubt your word but we would believe that you are still more than enough for all of our needs you're more than able to take control of every situation Lord if it be a job we would need or if it need a car we would need and Lord if it would be a uh Lord if if our family is wward I pray Lord you would restore everything to us Lord and you're more than able to do it if we'll just trust and rest in you tonight I pray you would move upon this church Lord
