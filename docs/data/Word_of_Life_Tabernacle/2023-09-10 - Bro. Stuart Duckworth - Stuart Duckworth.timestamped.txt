[45:05] little bit of worship under Redemption
[45:07] The Book of Ruth the second
[45:10] chapter just I titled this um Ruth
[45:15] moving out in faith amen Ruth 2 and
[45:20] one and Naomi had a Kinsman of her
[45:23] husband a mighty man of wealth
[45:26] of the family of
[45:29] IMC and his name was Boaz and Ruth and
[45:33] moabit has said unto Naomi and this was
[45:35] something that stuck out to me here let
[45:38] me go now to the field and glean ears of
[45:41] corn after him in whose sight I shall
[45:44] find Grace and she said unto her go my
[45:46] daughter and she went and came and
[45:49] gleaned in the field of the Reapers and
[45:52] her hat was to light on the part of the
[45:54] field belonging in unto Boaz who was of
[45:57] the Kindred of a lemon leg you can be
[46:00] seated this morning let's pray the Lord
[46:03] bless his word amen do you love him this
[46:06] morning aren't you thankful that we can
[46:09] gather together here and just certainly
[46:11] miss our brother Ben here I know y'all
[46:13] will this morning but I pray him and
[46:15] brother Joel are just enjoying
[46:16] themselves and just having a good time I
[46:18] know they are just kind of got to watch
[46:20] a little bit of the the meeting out
[46:22] there and this looks like they're having
[46:24] a wonderful time I pray they they got
[46:26] filled up and they can they can come
[46:28] back and preach for a while and maybe
[46:29] y'all won't have to hear me for a few
[46:32] few weeks
[46:34] anyways man we love him this morning
[46:37] this kind of set the scene here just a
[46:39] little bit of what we had preached
[46:41] before and Naomi and Ruth have come back
[46:45] to the land of promise and they have
[46:47] returned during the time of
[46:50] harvest they had left a land that was in
[46:53] famine and and in drought the land of
[46:55] Moab
[46:56] but they they come to a land they return
[46:59] to the land and the land is is plentiful
[47:01] they have come Amen to the Land of
[47:03] Plenty they've returned to the land of
[47:07] bread and a place of
[47:09] worship we see that by predestination
[47:13] God always brings his children back to
[47:15] their ordained
[47:17] Place Naomi and her family they had got
[47:19] out of the land they they had got out of
[47:21] their place and and just horrible things
[47:24] had happened to them but we know that
[47:26] God always brings back his seed he
[47:28] always brings back his children to their
[47:30] ordained place and in that place he
[47:33] doesn't just bring them back to
[47:35] something empty or something that that
[47:37] won't hold them but he brings them to a
[47:39] place that has sustaining life it has
[47:42] sustaining Grace amen for the journey
[47:45] he's not just bringing them back to
[47:47] nothing but he's bringing them back to
[47:49] himself no matter the situation or the
[47:52] circumstance the bad decisions no matter
[47:55] no matter how bad or what the situation
[47:58] would be what what what a a real seed of
[48:01] God what their past would be God will
[48:03] bring forth his predestinated seed and
[48:06] he will he will sustain it and bring it
[48:10] forth just think about our worship here
[48:13] this morning and and where we came from
[48:15] and the songs that have been sung this
[48:17] morning and and what God has done for us
[48:19] and and in Psalms 40 And1 David said I
[48:23] waited patiently for the Lord and He
[48:25] inclined unto me and heard My Cry he
[48:28] brought me up also out of an horrible
[48:31] pit and out of the myy clay and set my
[48:34] feet upon a rock and established my
[48:37] goings and he had put a new song in my
[48:40] mouth even praise unto our God Amen many
[48:44] shall see it in fear and shall trust in
[48:46] the Lord can you say Amen he's brought
[48:48] us out this morning we were in a mess we
[48:51] were in a horrible way we were in the
[48:54] pit but he was a able to bring us out
[48:57] why because we we weren't just just
[48:59] nobody but the son of man came by our
[49:03] way amen and the son of man comes to
[49:05] seek and save that which was lost amen
[49:08] we were we were in a horrible place but
[49:11] he brought us out and he sets us up he
[49:14] didn't just just bring us out to to
[49:15] bring us to nothing but he has brought
[49:17] us to the revelation of the word of the
[49:19] hour amen that we know that we can know
[49:21] where we stand that we can know what we
[49:23] believe that we can know who we are
[49:26] right and he didn't bring you out he
[49:29] didn't bring you out to lose you he
[49:32] didn't bring you that you could come in
[49:33] and that you could go out but he brought
[49:35] you in that he could keep you unto
[49:37] himself amen and mean he has brought us
[49:39] to
[49:42] himself amen but we have we have a
[49:44] purpose here this morning we have a
[49:47] purpose in this hour we have come Amen
[49:49] to hear the word of the lord we have
[49:51] come Amen to to to believe a message
[49:55] amen to receive a message to believe a
[49:57] message amen and we come to sit under
[49:59] that not just sit under a preacher amen
[50:02] But Me Myself amen I God delivered me
[50:05] out of the world he delivered me from
[50:07] all sorts of horrible things and and
[50:09] come and fill me with his life and now
[50:11] we're sitting here amen and we're under
[50:14] the message of the hour and God is
[50:15] bringing us somewhere we're not just
[50:18] here amen just moping along and just
[50:20] sitting around amen but we're here for a
[50:24] purpose we're here for a reason this
[50:27] morning is to believe his word is to
[50:29] worship him in the way that he wants to
[50:31] be
[50:33] worshiped Psalms
[50:35] 107 said let the redeemed of the Lord
[50:38] say so whom he hath redeemed from the
[50:41] hand of the enemy amen amen God took me
[50:44] from from what I what I couldn't deliver
[50:46] myself from he was able to deliver me
[50:50] from the hand of the enemy and then it
[50:52] said let the redeemed of the Lord say so
[50:54] let them testify of his goodness let
[50:57] them worship him let let them come into
[50:59] the house of God and and let everybody
[51:01] know where they stand and what God done
[51:03] for
[51:07] him he delivered us from the hand of the
[51:10] enemy Satan Satan's plot for our lives
[51:15] is
[51:16] destruction his purpose is to steal kill
[51:19] and destroy steal your joy your worship
[51:23] to kill your faith with doubt and
[51:28] unbelief and his plot has always been to
[51:31] destroy the seed of God from the very
[51:33] beginning we see that spirit in Cain
[51:36] where he tried to come and where he
[51:38] where he killed Abel and all the way
[51:41] down through God's servants and His
[51:43] prophets and his people have been
[51:44] persecuted and
[51:46] murdered and when Jesus when when he
[51:49] died on the cross and he went to hell
[51:50] there even Satan said brother Ram
[51:52] depicts the story of how I thought I had
[51:55] you when I killed Abel I thought I had
[51:58] you when I killed this one and Moses and
[52:00] this one I I thought I had you when I
[52:02] killed John the Baptist but now I've got
[52:04] you but he didn't really realize what he
[52:07] had on his hands he had the Redeemer he
[52:10] had the one whose corruption could not
[52:12] set forth in his body but Jesus come to
[52:15] hell with a purpose he come to Hell amen
[52:18] so you and I didn't have to go he came
[52:21] to hell to defeat hell and he took the
[52:24] keys from Satan he took the keys from
[52:26] his own house but it's always been
[52:29] Satan's purpose it's been his desire to
[52:33] destroy the seed of God Amen but the
[52:35] seed of God will always Prevail because
[52:37] it is a predestinated
[52:39] seed you're predestinated this morning
[52:42] not to fall you're predestinated this
[52:45] morning to stand Amen in this
[52:53] hour excuse me
[52:56] so Satan Satan's plot is destruction to
[52:58] steal kill destroy take away your faith
[53:01] take away your joy but God's plan this
[53:04] morning God's plan in this hour is
[53:06] greater than Satan's plot and God's plan
[53:09] is not a a system of man it's not an
[53:12] idea or a certain Doctrine but his plan
[53:15] is redemption his plan is to bring us
[53:18] back from what to what we were in his
[53:20] mind to bring us
[53:22] back amen as Sons and Daughters of God
[53:24] from what we fell from to bring us back
[53:27] to what we were in his thinking Amen to
[53:29] be the bride of Christ in this hour not
[53:31] just to be a a church not just because
[53:34] there's been churches churches there's
[53:35] been Brides brides amen but there's got
[53:38] to come one that's both mechanics and
[53:40] Dynamics one that worships in spirit and
[53:43] in truth there's got to be that kind of
[53:45] people on the Earth amen you're it was
[53:47] predestinated to be here that type of
[53:53] people amen amen a people that will let
[53:56] the life of Jesus be manifest and we're
[53:58] we're thinking about the seed can't be
[54:00] destroyed the seed must go on the the
[54:03] predestinated seed of God will Thrive it
[54:05] will go forth it will be who God called
[54:08] them to be it will manifest what God
[54:11] Amen for the portion and the word of
[54:13] their hour they will manifest that
[54:17] portion and we're here to let that life
[54:20] and his purpose come forth in us to be a
[54:22] people that worship Him in spirit and
[54:24] truth that we wouldn't be a dead church
[54:27] that we would be a church full of life
[54:30] because God hates a powerless church
[54:32] amen just the people that would just
[54:34] come and go and just sit amen and not
[54:36] not be able to be moved and that's the
[54:38] title of our sermon Ruth Ruth amen she
[54:41] come to a spot she had come out amen and
[54:43] she there was something that moved on
[54:45] Ruth she she was a predestinated seed
[54:48] and we've got as a seed of God we've got
[54:50] to be able to let God move Upon Us amen
[54:53] not just stay in the same spot
[54:55] but move amen with the spirit of God
[54:59] Amen when when God moves upon us to say
[55:01] Amen worship amen not be bound down
[55:04] creatures but to be able to move with
[55:06] the spirit to be able to move into his
[55:08] presence and in his presence that that's
[55:11] where things take place that's where the
[55:13] change
[55:17] happens well that's Satan's purpose is
[55:19] to bring spiritual death but God wants
[55:22] to bring life the word has been restored
[55:25] in this hour to restore people the
[55:28] fullness of the word being here the word
[55:30] of the word of Life Jesus Christ the
[55:32] very the very bread of life we have come
[55:35] we have come amen not to something empty

[56:00] for yourself there's been food stored up
[56:02] amen and I've got to be feeding upon
[56:04] that you've got to be feeding upon that

[56:08] hour that is what is going to bring
[56:10] forth the very bread of life that's what
[56:12] is going to bring forth the Bride of
[56:14] Jesus Christ in this
[56:15] [Music]
[56:17] hour God has brought us not to something
[56:21] empty but the fullness of the
[56:23] word and the full of the word will bring
[56:26] fullness of
[56:30] redemption the very living bread in a
[56:32] time of
[56:33] famine in a time of
[56:36] famine they prophesied they would run to
[56:39] and fro searching for
[56:41] bread they would search for for for the
[56:44] word of God not for bread or for water
[56:47] so much but it would be a dry time but
[56:50] they they would search for for the word
[56:52] of God but they wouldn't find it but it
[56:54] has come to the predestinated people
[57:01] amen so if we can move out in faith if
[57:04] you can move out if you can take a step
[57:07] this morning God will meet you there and
[57:11] that's what that's what many times God
[57:13] God's there sir the word is here but
[57:16] we've got to step forward in faith this
[57:19] morning you got to be willing to move I
[57:21] don't want you to run around in your
[57:23] seat or run around in here but but
[57:24] you've got to be able to move within
[57:26] yourself we got to be we got to be
[57:29] flexible we've got to be amen where
[57:31] where we can be into the moving of the
[57:33] spirit is what I'm trying to say you

[57:39] service after service the same way but
[57:42] we want to be changed
[57:44] amen amen we got to be able to move out
[57:47] in faith and God will meet us there he
[57:49] will provide what we as his
[57:51] predestinated SE need to come
[57:53] forth
[57:55] and Ruth and Naomi they didn't just need
[57:58] some food or drink excuse
[58:01] me they didn't just need food or drink
[58:04] though though they did need that though
[58:07] they did need that that had come from a
[58:08] famine but they needed a
[58:10] Kinsman they needed someone that was
[58:14] willing someone that was able to pay the
[58:17] price of redemption and bring them back
[58:19] to what they had Lo lost to look upon
[58:22] them with Grace look upon them in their
[58:25] and their poor condition their poorness
[58:27] of spirit and and their and their hunger
[58:29] and look upon them with
[58:31] Grace and it's the same thing for you
[58:33] and I we didn't just need a man or a
[58:36] man's idea or some new doctrine or some
[58:40] emotion or just to be able to be part of
[58:42] a good church somewhere though though
[58:44] those things are good but there was
[58:45] something in us that predestinated seed
[58:48] amen brought us to a person amen it
[58:51] brought us to someone amen we came in
[58:53] contact with someone that could redeem
[58:55] us not just make us better church people

[59:00] hour is to you and I it's the very
[59:02] person the very person come on preach

[59:33] the bread of life amen that we could
[59:35] bring forth Jesus
[59:38] Christ because he is the bread of life
[59:41] he is the word he is the message he is
[59:44] the person of the
[59:46] message amen it's not brother
[59:50] Brown it's not just a prophet the
[59:53] prophet himself had had to partake of
[59:55] that he was part of the Bride amen but a
[59:58] a redeemer amen the one that was worthy
[1:00:02] would come down because there was a
[1:00:04] prophet because there was someone there
[1:00:06] that could catch the mind of God amen
[1:00:09] amen the the star of our age the the
[1:00:12] messenger for our day to to relay this

[1:00:38] got to come and partake yourself you've
[1:00:40] got to be able to be move moved by the
[1:00:43] spirit of God and and the things that
[1:00:45] are said and brother bam said when the
[1:00:48] prophets would speak something in the
[1:00:50] Old Testament the people would tremble
[1:00:52] and they would Quake but we sit here and
[1:00:54] and we we feed upon the greatest and we
[1:00:56] hear the greatest message that's ever
[1:00:58] struck the face of the Earth Amen to the
[1:01:00] greatest people that's ever been upon
[1:01:02] the face of the Earth and we sit here

[1:01:39] when he puts you in the pawn shot and
[1:01:41] brother brandom says that also that the
[1:01:42] devil puts you in the pawn shot but he's
[1:01:44] saying here that that
[1:01:46] Adam Adam put us in the pawn
[1:01:49] shot he forfeited his rights he's the
[1:01:53] one that fell
[1:01:55] right you know they're they're in the
[1:01:57] garden they would play the the blame
[1:02:00] game you know the serpent told me to do
[1:02:03] this and the woman told me to do this
[1:02:06] and they play the blame Bame blame game
[1:02:08] but they all made their decision to do
[1:02:10] what they done that's
[1:02:13] right and I want to get to this later
[1:02:15] but we also have a decision to make
[1:02:18] whether we're going to reject the LIE of
[1:02:20] the devil yes amen or accept the LIE if
[1:02:24] we're going to continue to listen to his
[1:02:26] voice because his voice will be there
[1:02:28] till we're

[1:02:32] that voice that voice of doubt and
[1:02:34] reasoning till you're gone you have to
[1:02:36] make a
[1:02:39] decision but he redeemed us back to that
[1:02:42] Jesus Christ on Calvary was your Kinsman

[1:10:06] just like brother R said of of Luther or
[1:10:10] Luther if if Wesley's message would have
[1:10:12] came for his day he would have taken to
[1:10:14] it because he was the seed of God Amen

[1:10:57] everyone leaves though everyone forsakes

[1:11:02] you that won't turn
[1:11:06] back oh none go with me I'll follow

[1:11:15] Our Redeemer no man could do it nobody
[1:11:18] could do it it took him in this
[1:11:22] hour
[1:11:25] that brother R says that's when a person
[1:11:27] has caught a vision it don't it don't
[1:11:30] make any difference what her people said
[1:11:32] you're going over there to become a Holy
[1:11:34] Roller or something that didn't make any
[1:11:35] difference to Ruth there was a purpose
[1:11:37] of God to be
[1:11:39] fulfilled if we could just say it again
[1:11:42] there's a seed in you if you're a
[1:11:44] predestinated believer in this hour
[1:11:45] there's a seed in you and that's what
[1:11:48] that's what drawed you to this word
[1:11:49] that's what Drew you to him and that's
[1:11:52] what is manifesting itself
[1:11:54] amen it's not you becoming you but it's
[1:11:58] that real you inside

[1:12:28] fullness I believe that sir we got a
[1:12:31] purpose here this morning amen we're not
[1:12:34] just floating along there's a
[1:12:39] purpose brother R says here just as sure

[1:12:43] Spirit there something in you pulling
[1:12:45] you that's a purpose of God in your life
[1:12:49] has got to be fulfilled just like it was
[1:12:51] for Ruth and he said that's what God
[1:12:52] wants not that borderline halfway but an
[1:12:55] absolute a full surrender to the kingdom
[1:12:58] of God that's what God wants this in
[1:13:01] this hour to bring Amen to to bring that
[1:13:03] predestinated seed forth that's what

[1:13:16] prophet oh he he's got to be false he's
[1:13:19] got to be false no matter what even
[1:13:21] though the Bible said there' be a
[1:13:22] prophet in this hour
[1:13:23] amen well we can see those things we can
[1:13:26] understand those things because God has

[1:20:23] was there to find Grace it didn't matter
[1:20:26] what everybody else thought and you've

[1:35:15] that was in her amen and she had to
[1:35:17] overcome that and so here we are in
[1:35:20] Satan's Eden and we've got to overcome

[1:35:47] it couldn't be an angel it couldn't be
[1:35:49] an angel an angel amen wasn't l lost
[1:35:52] humans were lost so God had to come down
[1:35:54] in the form of a man amen and pay that

[1:36:20] curse everything that is
[1:36:22] wrong Ruth had a predestinated
[1:36:25] moment man she had a predestinated
[1:36:28] moment and the Bible says that it was
[1:36:29] her hap to light on the field belonging
[1:36:32] to Boaz and that word ha there it means
[1:36:35] an unforeseen meeting an accident like
[1:36:38] it was an accident but it really wasn't
[1:36:39] an
[1:36:40] accident it was just it was just chance

[1:36:56] Fortune it means fate it was your fate
[1:36:59] God predestinated you to this truth amen
[1:37:02] so she had come to her place of Grace
[1:37:04] and rest she had a meeting with the
[1:37:07] Kinsman her future husband only only
[1:37:10] this man only this man could Elevate her

[1:37:41] would slay a bear and this is what comes

[1:37:46] predestinated child of God that Warrior

[1:37:52] that anointed king that anointed priest
[1:37:55] amen amen that will slay a giant amen
[1:37:59] that predestinated seed has to come
