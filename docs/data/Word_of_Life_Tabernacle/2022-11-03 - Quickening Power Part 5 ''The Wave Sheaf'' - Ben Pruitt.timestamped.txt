[31:21] [Music]
[31:48] all the grace had gone my falling
[31:56] [Music]
[32:12] bow our heads together for word of
[32:14] prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful
[32:16] to be in your presence tonight and Lord
[32:19] I especially prayed tonight for those
[32:21] that are sick I know there's several
[32:23] children Lord Lang and maybe watching
[32:26] this service tonight or maybe they're
[32:27] just too sick and they've fallen asleep
[32:30] but Lord I I know that you're the God
[32:32] who is not bound by walls and or though
[32:35] we would not be able to touch them
[32:36] physically tonight and lay our hands on
[32:38] them but Lord you're there and may your
[32:41] angels go down where they're at Lord And
[32:43] heal them this evening Lord different
[32:46] ones in the church Lord It's struggling
[32:48] with sickness and I know it's Lord It's
[32:50] just things that come through and and
[32:52] test us but Lord I pray that you'd bless
[32:54] them tonight and Lord may they realize
[32:57] that you're the Healer Lord and that
[32:59] you've bless them in this in this
[33:01] situation Lord I pray for those that are
[33:03] here and those that are watching Lord
[33:05] give us a revelation of your word
[33:07] tonight we realize that a revelation of
[33:09] your word is actually a revelation of us
[33:12] Lord for we are your word not not these
[33:14] bodies but Lord on the inside there's a
[33:17] seed that is your word help us to know
[33:19] who we are and where we belong and what
[33:22] we are and we'll give you all the praise
[33:24] and the glory and the honor let me ask
[33:26] it in Jesus name
[33:27] amen amen God bless you let's turn to
[33:30] Leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9.
[33:34] Leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9.
[33:37] that's the third book of the Bible
[33:39] Genesis Exodus and Leviticus you have to
[33:42] bear with me a little bit tonight I been
[33:45] a little bit under the weather myself
[33:46] but I'm much much better but it's just
[33:48] been a couple days seems like that
[33:50] little sickness comes through and
[33:52] anytime you try to get people together
[33:54] anymore it seems like everybody gets
[33:55] sick but but it's worth it anyway to be
[33:58] around the uh the bride of Christ and to
[34:01] love one another and so we'll just grin
[34:03] and bear it and but it's just the age
[34:06] that we live in the devil fights us that
[34:07] way Leviticus
[34:09] 23-9 I want to speak to you tonight on
[34:11] the wave chief
[34:13] and it is important if you're listening
[34:16] tonight or if you have a chance I know
[34:18] it when you're sick it's hard to listen
[34:19] maybe you can come back later and and
[34:22] catch it because it's kind of an
[34:23] important topic and I just hope I can
[34:25] get through it tonight and and don't you
[34:27] love the word
[34:29] amen the word is always good
[34:33] amen Leviticus 23 9 the Lord spoke to
[34:35] Moses saying speaking to the children of
[34:37] Israel and saying to them when you be
[34:39] coming to the land which I've given to
[34:41] you and shall reap the Harvest thereof
[34:43] then you shall bring a Sheaf of the
[34:45] first fruits of your Harvest and to the
[34:47] priest and he shall wave the Sheaf
[34:49] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[34:52] on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[34:55] priest
[34:57] I'll waive it so this is at a particular
[34:59] time a particular Feast that they would
[35:02] have and there would be a Sheaf waved
[35:05] before the Lord offered to the Lord in
[35:07] that way I pray the Lord when that is
[35:09] blessing to the word you may be seated
[35:14] in 1752 Benjamin Franklin took his son
[35:18] to fly a kite in a thunderstorm
[35:20] and he had a purpose for that I think
[35:22] I've got that Esther on the slide just
[35:25] to keep your attention tonight while I
[35:27] get started and kind of get going but uh
[35:31] that he was finding that electricity
[35:34] could be conducted and controlled he
[35:36] didn't invent electricity electricity is
[35:38] a natural force but he learned how to
[35:41] conduct it how to control it and so him
[35:44] on one end and then 127 years later
[35:47] Thomas Edison invented the light bulb
[35:50] and I think I have a picture of him as
[35:52] well so on one end Benjamin Franklin uh
[35:56] he and he he found that electricity
[35:58] could be controlled on the other end
[36:00] Thomas Edison found a way to bring light
[36:03] into people's homes and what it was is
[36:06] Thomas or Benjamin Franklin rather you
[36:08] could look at him as the wave Chief or
[36:11] the first fruit so wave sheep is just
[36:13] the first fruits of anything it it's the
[36:16] first one to do it if we could put it
[36:19] like that the first one to do it was was
[36:20] Benjamin Franklin and then Thomas Edison
[36:23] comes out it's in a different form but
[36:26] it's still the same thing and so that
[36:28] was the Feast of the wave Chief and then
[36:30] the wave lows which I'll get into in a
[36:33] moment one shows that something can be
[36:35] done and another does it
[36:39] I he rep they replicate it but in a mass
[36:42] scale in business it's called scaling
[36:45] and so that's the principle of the wave
[36:47] Chief you'll find it in the scripture
[36:50] when David he comes out and and he comes
[36:54] against Goliath and you remember what he
[36:56] did he he didn't just kill him but he
[36:58] went and cut his head off with his own
[37:00] sword and then he holds the head up
[37:03] right he takes the head kind of a
[37:05] Grizzly picture isn't it he takes the
[37:07] head and holds it up and shows it to the
[37:09] other people why is he doing that he's
[37:11] doing that because that he's being a
[37:14] wave Chief he's actually being a first
[37:17] fruit he's saying come on boys we can do
[37:19] this
[37:20] we can take it we oh that's what we want
[37:23] to be tonight don't we we want to be the
[37:25] if something needs to be done let's be
[37:27] the first one to do it and say I want to
[37:30] show others it can be done it is
[37:32] possible to live a Christian Life it is
[37:34] possible to to do the things that we
[37:37] need to do and and so you could even
[37:39] take that principle and type it in many
[37:41] different ways but you could take it to
[37:43] people in a church and you could say
[37:45] that brother Danny's generation was a
[37:47] wave Chief to our generation a book in
[37:50] said his generation showed it could be
[37:52] done that people could live in Hardy
[37:55] Arkansas and and have things that happen
[37:57] to him but yet they remain Christians
[37:59] and and then my generation and and and
[38:02] brother Levi and those that are under
[38:04] younger even they can show on the other
[38:06] end that it can come out in a body form
[38:09] and and there'll be even more that'll
[38:11] come out and and so we see that uh what
[38:14] can what what has been shown that could
[38:16] be done we can do
[38:18] so that's the principle of the wave
[38:20] Chief now brother Branham first mentions
[38:22] that in a message titled Feast of the
[38:24] trumpets if you've ever listened to that
[38:27] sermon It's a Wonderful sermon but he
[38:29] just mentions it briefly in relation to
[38:31] the seven Church ages and he kind of
[38:34] gets his words mixed up and he corrects
[38:36] that in questions and answers number one
[38:38] in 1964.
[38:40] and so if you listen to Feast of the
[38:43] trumpets you're going to get your feast
[38:45] days mixed up
[38:46] because brother Branham does when he's
[38:48] there he gets he he carries one thought
[38:51] over into another and so if you go to
[38:53] that next side Esther I think there's a
[38:55] I think I've got a list of the feast
[38:57] days I know you probably can't read the
[38:58] dates but it's not really important I
[39:00] just wanted to get you to see the order
[39:01] of it the first Feast was Passover
[39:04] Passover was in the first month of the
[39:07] year and it's kind of interesting that
[39:09] God said okay the fourth month will be
[39:11] the first month
[39:12] right and that's April he said April
[39:15] will be the first month of the year to
[39:16] you and so God just does what he wants
[39:19] to doesn't he
[39:20] and so he just set that as the first
[39:22] month and so the first month of the 14th
[39:24] day that that's the Passover and then
[39:27] immediately after that as a feast of
[39:29] unleavened bread and
[39:30] and then the first month the day after
[39:32] the Sabbath that's the first fruits
[39:35] which is the wave Chief brother Branham
[39:38] talks about and then it's not just the
[39:40] way of sheath by the way it's a wave
[39:41] offering and there's a principle here
[39:43] see the way of offering is Christ
[39:47] that's the main type
[39:49] but remember what I said that there can
[39:51] always be a wave Chief or something we
[39:53] could type as static Benjamin Franklin
[39:55] right there's always a beginner somebody
[39:58] who started something and so we could
[40:01] type that again even to Elders in the
[40:02] church but but the main type is Christ
[40:05] and so then Pentecost follows 50 days
[40:08] after or seven sabbaths after first
[40:11] fruits and then there's a long period of
[40:13] time in that long period of time it's
[40:16] actually seven months in between
[40:17] Pentecost and the Feast of trumpets
[40:19] which we know was to the Jews in the day
[40:21] of atonement so now as as you continue
[40:24] through that with a random typeset uh 50
[40:27] days he calls that seven sabbaths calls
[40:29] it the seven Church ages but actually
[40:31] comes back and corrects himself and says
[40:33] it was not that but it was the seven the
[40:36] seven months in between Pentecost and
[40:38] the trumpets so he goes into that and he
[40:41] said you remember there the sheath turns
[40:43] into a loaf of bread after that time
[40:46] Chief turns into a loaf of bread after
[40:48] that time he said he said when the Sheep
[40:50] when one Sheaf goes into one loaf we
[40:52] know there was two loaves but what he's
[40:54] saying is it's the same material that's
[40:56] in the Sheaf it's the same material
[40:58] that's in the loaf
[41:01] he said oh it's a great teaching there
[41:03] he said I didn't touch the edge of it
[41:04] but if you happen to catch that on your
[41:06] tape he said remember look in the Bible
[41:08] and if you have a question about
[41:10] something brother random says it'd be a
[41:12] good thing to look in the Bible
[41:14] so we could all look in our Bible and
[41:15] begin to see and we're going to do that
[41:17] in just a moment and so he said then he
[41:19] said some Minister might pick that up he
[41:21] said and then you'd have it see and so
[41:24] in Leviticus 23 and 12 he said You shall
[41:27] offer that day when you wave this Sheaf
[41:29] a helam without blemish of the first
[41:31] year for a burnt offering unto the Lord
[41:33] and the meat offering thereof shall be
[41:35] two tenth deals the fine flower mingle
[41:37] with oil and offering made by fire unto
[41:40] the Lord for a sweet savor
[41:42] a drink offering there should be of wine
[41:44] the fourth part of a hen and you shall
[41:47] eat neither bread nor Parts corn or
[41:49] green ears until the self same day that
[41:51] you brought an offering unto your God it
[41:53] shall be a statute forever threat or
[41:55] generation generations and all your
[41:57] dwellings so he said this was the very
[41:59] first grain that was brought out of the
[42:01] field in all of Israel would be the
[42:03] first fruits of the wave offering he
[42:05] said You shall count unto you from the
[42:07] morrow after the Sabbath from the day
[42:09] that you brought the Sheaf of the wave
[42:11] offering seven sabbaths shall be
[42:13] complete so now this is we're coming to
[42:16] Pentecost Pentecost means 50. he said
[42:18] even until tomorrow after the seventh
[42:20] Sabbath so you remember 50 days you
[42:23] shall offer a new meat offering unto the
[42:25] Lord you shall bring out of your
[42:26] habitations that's out of your home so
[42:28] now they've gathered in the Harvest
[42:30] they've went out and gotten wave sheeps
[42:33] now they tell me that it takes about
[42:34] three square meters of land to produce
[42:38] one loaf of bread
[42:40] so it takes it takes a whole sheath
[42:43] Maybe
[42:44] of wheat to produce one loaf of bread
[42:47] so now but when you when you take that
[42:49] it there's everything though that's in
[42:51] the grain that's in the in the
[42:53] individual grains in the bread it's just
[42:55] in in a mass form and it's been changed
[42:58] so they've taken that into their homes
[42:59] they've baked it and they've ground it
[43:02] and they've baked it and they've
[43:03] actually produced bread with it he said
[43:05] then you take the bread he said and
[43:08] it'll be two wave lows of two tenth
[43:10] deals it shall be a fine flower they
[43:12] shall be bacon with leaven they're the
[43:14] first fruits unto the Lord so now that
[43:17] were the first fruits that were at the
[43:19] wave sheep and the first fruits at
[43:21] Pentecost now remember that as we go
[43:23] through this tonight is anybody confused
[43:25] yet
[43:27] I know many of you have heard this
[43:29] before but I've actually realized
[43:31] recently that many people some things we
[43:33] should know we don't know or we don't we
[43:35] just don't remember so maybe we need to
[43:38] go back over it so uh let's go back into
[43:41] the it is the rising of the sun because
[43:42] you need to understand the biblical
[43:44] background to this in order to
[43:46] understand what brother branham's saying
[43:48] and it is the rising of the Sun
[43:50] he said if there would be any holy
[43:52] ritual that should come forth on the
[43:54] Sabbath day which was the seventh day of
[43:56] the week which is Saturday he said but
[43:58] did you notice in this Memorial to wave
[44:00] it on the first day of the week he said
[44:03] the Sheaf which was the first of your
[44:05] seed that you planted when it comes up
[44:07] in ripe and you cut down this sheath and
[44:09] take it to the freeze let him take it
[44:12] and wave it before the Lord for your
[44:13] exception that you are accepted you have
[44:16] come with your sheath and he has to wave
[44:17] up before the Lord he said not on the
[44:19] Sabbath the seventh day but on the first
[44:21] day which we call Sunday s-u-n-d-a-y he
[44:24] said of course that's the Roman word
[44:26] which they called it the Sunday for the
[44:27] son God but how it has changed it's not
[44:30] s-u-n anymore it's the
[44:33] s-o-n-v-a-y the Sunday that the corn of
[44:37] wheat God's first one up from the dead
[44:40] aren't you glad he came up from the dead
[44:42] he said God's first one up from the dead
[44:44] is to be waived over the congregation
[44:47] that we are his seed he said and that's
[44:51] the first of the seed of those that
[44:53] slept waved upon the first day of the
[44:55] week so so far the type is very simple
[44:59] it's very simple it's Christ
[45:01] right being raised from the dead as the
[45:04] Sheep is raised up in a waved on in the
[45:07] first fruits Feast he said now I hear is
[45:11] Christ being waived on on Sunday
[45:13] literally on the first day of the week
[45:15] he said he on Sunday he raised up he
[45:18] said wave goodbye send it up on high on
[45:21] the presence of the people he said
[45:22] notice it was the first corn of God's
[45:24] wheat that had been raised from the dead
[45:27] God's first corn of wheat he said by
[45:31] God's quickening power God had quickened
[45:33] his life raised him up from the dead and
[45:36] he was the firstfruits of those that
[45:39] slept the first fruit he was that Chief
[45:43] yes now Paul taught this same Doctrine
[45:46] right you know Paul taught about the
[45:48] wave chief
[45:49] he taught that in First Corinthians 15
[45:51] and 20. he said Christ is the first
[45:54] fruits now a Jew listening to that would
[45:56] understand he's talking about the wave
[45:58] feast or what we call the wave sheath
[46:00] the Feast of the first fruits Christ is
[46:03] the wave Chief Christ is the first
[46:04] fruits he said now is Christ risen from
[46:07] the dead and become the first fruits of
[46:09] them that slept that word is first
[46:11] fruits the earliest crops of the year
[46:13] and again you could use that in
[46:15] different types it could be even the
[46:17] earliest converts in a district yes and
[46:19] it was used that way the first fruits
[46:22] right but there's got to come wherever
[46:24] there was a first fruits there has to be
[46:26] a Pentecost
[46:28] right so you see a Biblical principle
[46:30] there's a first fruits it's waved it's
[46:33] got to be waved again at Pentecost
[46:34] that's true in your life you will you
[46:37] come to the message you receive Christ
[46:39] into your heart but there's got to be a
[46:41] time when it becomes a loaf it's got to
[46:42] live through your life
[46:45] so what what was done in Christ had to
[46:47] live through the church
[46:49] right now so again the first fruits
[46:53] verse 21 for since my Man Came Death by
[46:56] man came also the resurrection of the
[46:58] Dead for as in Adam all die even so in
[47:02] Christ shall all be made alive someone
[47:03] say all all be made alive who how are we
[47:07] made alive in Christ that's the only way
[47:10] he said but every man in his own order
[47:12] Christ again the first fruits afterwards
[47:16] they that are Christ and it's coming
[47:18] again this is not a common Greek word
[47:20] this is something that the Jews would
[47:22] have understood as being the Feast of
[47:24] the first fruits
[47:26] he said that's why they had to wave that
[47:28] Sheaf again going back to it is the
[47:30] rising of the Sun he said that's why
[47:32] they had to wave that Sheaf for it was
[47:35] the first one to come to maturity
[47:37] and it was waived as a memorial of
[47:39] Thanksgiving to God believing that the
[47:41] rest of them would come it was a sign
[47:46] amen and today because he was the first
[47:48] Son of God to come to full maturity to
[47:52] be in God he was plucked up from the
[47:54] earth and is waived over the people
[47:57] he said oh what a glorious Lesson by the
[48:00] quickening power the first one he said
[48:03] although he had been typed many times as
[48:06] we'll see later that he was tight so
[48:08] he's again he's saying he was typed many
[48:10] times but this was he this was the real
[48:12] type this was this was not the type but
[48:15] the anotype this was the reality of it
[48:17] this was the Fulfillment of it
[48:19] so now he said oh he said but this was
[48:23] really the first fruit of them that
[48:24] slept he was waived over the promised
[48:27] seed that had promise of life now if you
[48:30] go into that sermon brother randleman's
[48:32] then going to take it and I hope I'm not
[48:34] boring you tonight but we're just going
[48:35] to kind of dig in real deep and then
[48:37] we'll we'll get out of it maybe and
[48:39] apply it in some way to our lives but
[48:40] but brother Branham when he preaches
[48:43] this he begins to give a dual
[48:45] fulfillment and begins to talk about it
[48:48] and also begins to talk about the way of
[48:50] loaves that was waved at the day of
[48:52] Pentecost and he goes on in the next fir
[48:54] or the next paragraph and he says he was
[48:57] waived at the day of Pentecost
[48:59] he said when there come a sound from
[49:01] heaven like I'm wave a waving Mighty
[49:04] rushing wind and was waved over the
[49:06] people the Pentecostal people that was
[49:09] up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing
[49:11] to come so now again where does this fit
[49:13] in the type it's Pentecost 50 days after
[49:16] the wave chief
[49:18] the loaves were waived
[49:20] so you could say there were 120 loaves
[49:23] baking in the upper room
[49:26] right and and then the Holy Ghost picked
[49:28] up those loaves
[49:30] and started waving them before the
[49:32] people
[49:33] and said this is that
[49:36] yeah right
[49:37] so you see how simple that is so now
[49:40] that's another type so now he said no
[49:44] now notice brother Brandon says he was
[49:46] waived he was waived at the day of
[49:49] Pentecost not something else was waived
[49:52] he was waived
[49:54] even though it was now in low form it
[49:56] was in church form it was the book of
[49:58] Acts Church
[50:00] it was in the form of Peter and and John
[50:03] and the apostles in 120 but he was
[50:06] waived Christ is the first fruits he's
[50:08] also the bread
[50:10] but that's he's in a different body one
[50:12] loaf one Chief the bread we know is the
[50:14] type of the church because it has leaven
[50:17] in it now again he goes on he said to be
[50:19] waved again he said we realized in the
[50:22] last day according to Luke 17 30 he said
[50:24] in the Sun the Sunday again the son day
[50:27] again he said in the day that the son
[50:30] s-o-n of man will be revealed or waved
[50:33] again over the people so brother Madam
[50:37] takes this now and he's applying it to a
[50:39] different type
[50:40] and he's saying it's going to happen
[50:41] again at the end time but he's saying
[50:44] according to Luke 17 30. so he ties the
[50:47] wave sheath to the coming of the son of
[50:49] man or the revealing of the son of man
[50:51] so he says the son of man will be
[50:53] revealed or waived so Luke 17 30 is if
[50:57] you tie those two together in your Bible
[50:59] Luke 17 30 and Leviticus where we read
[51:03] in Leviticus 21 I believe it was that's
[51:05] those two things tied together so now uh
[51:09] now he said to be waived again over the
[51:11] people now what was brother Branham
[51:13] now when we begin to think about these
[51:15] things because you'll hear a lot of
[51:16] different things but we need to make
[51:18] sure that we are rightly dividing the
[51:20] word brother Branham was a son of man
[51:23] right revealing the son of man
[51:26] right he's not the son of man he's a son
[51:28] of man
[51:30] because again peace son of man is Christ
[51:33] so we could say it like this brother
[51:35] random is a wave Sheaf
[51:39] but he's not the wave chief
[51:42] he can't be the type yeah but he can be
[51:45] a type
[51:47] and and the sin city is a type because
[51:49] he was the first one in our generation
[51:51] to believe the message
[51:53] you realize that brother random had to
[51:55] believe the message too right right he
[51:58] was the one that had to come with it he
[51:59] didn't just automatically he had to
[52:01] believe it yeah and then he had to come
[52:03] and preach it to us
[52:05] and so uh he was the first one of the
[52:08] message and not only did he believe it
[52:09] but he manifested it and he showed us
[52:12] what that could do and the power of the
[52:14] third pole the power of the open book
[52:15] The Power of what God could do in a man
[52:18] and what God could do in a Ministry and
[52:20] so what was it it was a wave sheath but
[52:23] not the wave sheath because then you
[52:24] make him God yeah
[52:26] right a son of man but not these
[52:29] sentiment brother random answers that
[52:30] question they said brother Brown some
[52:32] say you're the son of man I thought the
[52:34] pillar of fire was the son of man he
[52:35] said they needed one word
[52:37] but he said he said it's a good question
[52:39] he said but he said there's a big
[52:41] difference between a son of man and the
[52:43] son of man
[52:44] right and so it's not the son of man
[52:47] it's not v-wave sheath because that is
[52:49] always Christ
[52:50] and again brother Branham immediately
[52:52] follows that up with this he said now
[52:54] who is the son of man
[52:56] he said in the beginning was the word
[52:58] now what's he quoting John chapter 1.
[53:01] right who is the son of man in the
[53:04] beginning was the word and the Word was
[53:06] with God and the Word was God and the
[53:09] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[53:12] who is the son of man the word
[53:15] was made flesh the son of man is the
[53:18] word made flesh right now and again this
[53:22] is a foundational teaching so I'm taking
[53:24] it slowly tonight on purpose because I'm
[53:26] not a very good teacher so I'm trying to
[53:29] I'm trying to help myself as well just
[53:31] make sure that we really we really
[53:33] understand this because people have
[53:35] always had difficulty with this right
[53:37] when Jesus come he didn't explain it he
[53:41] come to them in John chapter 6 and verse
[53:43] 51 he said I am the living bread which
[53:45] came down from heaven
[53:47] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[53:49] live forever and the bread that I will
[53:51] give is my flesh which I will give for
[53:53] the life of the world
[53:55] the Jews therefore strove among
[53:57] themselves saying how can this man give
[53:59] us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto
[54:02] them verily verily I said to you except
[54:04] you eat the Flesh of the son of man
[54:07] now watch if they ate his flesh would be
[54:09] cannibals
[54:11] and they knew that they knew it wouldn't
[54:13] it wouldn't work with the law so who is
[54:15] the son of man
[54:16] now think about it the son of man cannot
[54:18] be just the literal flesh of Jesus
[54:21] Christ but it's the word made flesh the
[54:24] son of man is the word
[54:26] because that's what we eat amen so he
[54:29] said how can this man give us his flesh
[54:30] Jesus said except you eat the Flesh of
[54:33] the son of man and drink his blood you
[54:34] have no life in you and brother Brown
[54:37] tells us he never did explain that but
[54:39] there were some who were ordained to
[54:41] life who believed it anyway well I'm so
[54:44] glad that I can believe even what I
[54:46] don't understand aren't you glad for
[54:48] that and then he lets us understand many
[54:51] things but there's some things that
[54:53] we'll never understand in life I'll tell
[54:55] you one you'll never understand you'll
[54:56] never understand the mystery of
[54:57] suffering
[54:59] you'll never figure out why people
[55:01] suffer why some people suffer and other
[55:03] people do not but he said you don't have
[55:05] to understand if you trust me yeah right
[55:08] right and that's what he's telling his
[55:09] disciples if you believe me if you trust
[55:11] me you don't have to understand it but
[55:13] you're going to eat my flesh
[55:15] you're gonna drink my blood
[55:17] so again he made it sound like it was
[55:19] his literal flesh and blood but it
[55:21] wasn't
[55:22] he he made it sound that way on purpose
[55:24] but the brown said he did it that to
[55:26] stumble them but those were named to
[55:28] life believed
[55:29] now again and I've read this many times
[55:32] to you but this is where brother Branham
[55:33] takes this from he said the angel is not
[55:36] the son of man he was the messenger from
[55:38] the son of man the son of man is Christ
[55:41] he is the one that you're feeding on
[55:43] you're not feeding on a man again you're
[55:46] not even feeding on the literal flesh of
[55:48] Christ
[55:49] you're not feeding on a man he said a
[55:52] man his words will fail but you're
[55:54] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[55:57] the son of man yes so you see where
[55:59] brother Brandon takes that from
[56:01] and again go back to the word always go
[56:03] back to the Bible and you'll see that
[56:05] these things have a have a place
[56:07] now if we go back to it is the rising of
[56:09] the Sun
[56:10] brother random continues on talking
[56:12] about this wave chief that is the word
[56:14] the son of man being revealed he said if
[56:17] all the teaching that we have and
[56:19] confirmation of the word of God by word
[56:21] of God by Signs by wonders we see today
[56:24] he said that in the Book of Luke here he
[56:27] said we just quoted from the 17th
[56:28] chapter in the 30th verse and Malachi 4
[56:30] and the different scriptures that we are
[56:32] acquainted with that the word again is
[56:35] waived over the people that the Dead
[56:37] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[56:40] God is alive again now watch the Son of
[56:43] God is alive again with the baptism of
[56:45] the Holy Spirit right Among Us and it's
[56:48] giving us life
[56:50] so it wasn't brought even the revealing
[56:53] of the son of man was not just in word
[56:54] only
[56:55] but in power
[56:57] how many believe that tonight I'm not
[57:00] going to hold you real long tonight so
[57:01] just bear with me
[57:03] so he said as Christ was the first one
[57:06] to raise from all the prophets and so
[57:08] forth although type too many places he
[57:10] was the first fruits of those that slept
[57:13] in the bride coming of Christ coming out
[57:16] of the church
[57:17] there will have to be a Sheaf waved
[57:20] again in the last days
[57:22] Oh my he said a waving of the Sheaf what
[57:26] was the sheath the first one that come
[57:28] to mature the first one that proved it
[57:31] it was a wheat that proved it was a
[57:33] Sheaf
[57:34] right the first one that proved
[57:36] electricity could be conducted right so
[57:38] there has to be a wave chief so that
[57:41] somebody can make a light bulb yeah yeah
[57:43] there's got to be someone there had to
[57:45] be a Christ to raise so that we could be
[57:47] raised there had to be someone in this
[57:49] age live under the message and become
[57:53] become the fullness of the word in our
[57:56] day in the sense not in the sense of
[57:58] being the fullness of God but in the
[57:59] sense of of in their place in their
[58:02] position and that was Christ working
[58:04] through a prophet but it was also Christ
[58:06] working through you and I
[58:08] right it is Christ working through you
[58:10] and I to bring us to that maturity
[58:13] amen
[58:15] so again the first one had to come to
[58:17] maturity produce a Sheaf he said
[58:19] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[58:20] talking about it was waived over the
[58:23] people and the first time there will
[58:25] come forth for the bride age
[58:27] for a resurrection out of dark
[58:29] denominationalism
[58:31] will be a message
[58:34] amen here's your wife's chief
[58:37] right there's that there's the reality
[58:40] of it it's the message it's the words
[58:42] Christ right that the full maturity of
[58:45] the word has turned back again in its
[58:48] full power someone say full power
[58:51] full power what that means is that
[58:53] whatever however went down that's how
[58:55] it's going to come up however it was
[58:57] waived that's how it's going to be
[58:58] weighed back
[59:00] he said it's turned back again in his
[59:02] full power and being waived over the
[59:03] People by the same signs and wonders
[59:06] that he did back there
[59:09] because I live oh this is so good
[59:12] tonight because not because I'm saying
[59:14] it but just because of what we're
[59:15] reading because I live you live also
[59:18] speaking to his wife
[59:20] oh aren't you glad he wasn't speaking to
[59:22] some denomination somewhere he was
[59:24] speaking to you he was speaking to his
[59:26] wife and you're his wife whether you're
[59:29] sick or in need or struggling or
[59:31] whatever it is that you're going through
[59:32] tonight you're still his wife right
[59:36] amen
[59:37] I want to deal with I don't have time
[59:39] tonight but I want to deal with it at
[59:40] some point you can't go from one group
[59:42] to the other
[59:44] yeah and maybe we will just briefly in
[59:46] our communion service coming up but you
[59:48] can't go from being bride to being the
[59:51] world yeah you can't get out of one
[59:53] group and just become another say well
[59:55] I'll make a mistake and I'll fail and
[59:57] I'll I'll not be bright anymore no he's
[59:59] speaking to his wife because I live
[1:00:02] you live also because I live you live
[1:00:05] that takes works out of it that takes
[1:00:07] everything I can do out of it it's on
[1:00:09] him
[1:00:10] right because I live you live off so
[1:00:12] what a resurrection that that was and
[1:00:14] what a resurrection this is to be
[1:00:17] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:00:19] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[1:00:23] power
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:26] now watch he said he was waved to them
[1:00:30] the word
[1:00:32] watch how he words it the word which he
[1:00:34] was
[1:00:35] waved back to them
[1:00:38] on the day of Pentecost
[1:00:41] the word made manifest
[1:00:44] so now he was waved to them he was waved
[1:00:47] to them when he raised from the from the
[1:00:49] dead
[1:00:50] on Sunday on the first day of the week
[1:00:53] and now on Pentecost he was waves back
[1:00:57] right now and as I say it's to be waived
[1:00:59] again
[1:01:00] in the last day yes
[1:01:03] so it was waived it was way back now
[1:01:06] it's waved again
[1:01:08] and what's it got to do it's got to be
[1:01:09] way back
[1:01:12] right what was waived ingrained for yes
[1:01:15] must be waived in edible form
[1:01:19] right and that's what I was talking
[1:01:20] about I believe it was the week before
[1:01:22] last when I talked we talked about being
[1:01:24] red on his table yes
[1:01:26] said we need to lay in the presence of
[1:01:29] the sun until we become bread on the
[1:01:31] stable we become ripe we become mature
[1:01:33] all the greenness is out of us we get to
[1:01:35] a place where we can love one another
[1:01:36] and we can we don't we don't prickle at
[1:01:39] each other all the time we don't stick
[1:01:40] each other all the time right we get to
[1:01:43] a place of maturity where we can have
[1:01:45] Fellowship one with another why were all
[1:01:47] the bread we're the bread on this table
[1:01:49] right
[1:01:50] right and what do you do when you when
[1:01:51] you take the Grain and you take it down
[1:01:53] out of the Sheaf and the Sheaf it abides
[1:01:56] its little grains but when it comes into
[1:01:59] bread form it's ground down and pressed
[1:02:02] together yeah
[1:02:04] yeah I think that's the age we're living
[1:02:05] in right in red form the church is
[1:02:09] ground down and pressed together to be
[1:02:12] the wave loaf that's way back amen
[1:02:16] during the 50 days the grain was
[1:02:18] harvested hauled to the mill and ground
[1:02:21] up to show that what had what had come
[1:02:23] out as a wave sheath would come out as
[1:02:25] bread that just showed that there was
[1:02:28] something to eat amen there was
[1:02:30] something that what he promised and what
[1:02:32] it really was is they were telling God
[1:02:34] they were saying Lord you made a promise
[1:02:36] to us and when we come into this land
[1:02:39] there would be an abundance of food
[1:02:41] there would be Bread on our table you
[1:02:44] promised us Lord we would not starve
[1:02:47] when we come into the land you made
[1:02:49] certain promises and we're waving the
[1:02:52] Sheaf to show your promises are true and
[1:02:55] 50 days later we're going to wave the
[1:02:58] loaves to show your promises are still
[1:03:00] true
[1:03:01] the Sheaf was waived to show his
[1:03:03] promises were still true the bread was
[1:03:06] waived to show his promises were still
[1:03:08] true he was waived to show that The
[1:03:10] Promise was true the at Pentecost he was
[1:03:13] waved back to show the promise was true
[1:03:15] in the end time at the message of the
[1:03:17] hour he was waived over the people
[1:03:19] that right right he was waived in
[1:03:21] discernment he was waived in great
[1:03:23] meetings coast to coast and that people
[1:03:25] saw healing meetings he come with
[1:03:27] healing in his wings he was waived over
[1:03:29] the people
[1:03:31] let's be way back
[1:03:35] are you hearing me now
[1:03:37] that's us
[1:03:40] that's not brother Brandon's job
[1:03:42] now again if you make brother Branham
[1:03:44] thee wave Chief right then he has to be
[1:03:48] waived back
[1:03:50] right if you make him the son of man he
[1:03:53] has to come back
[1:03:55] if you make him the wave sheath he has
[1:03:58] to come back to be the wave loaf
[1:04:00] right but he don't have to come back
[1:04:03] because he's a wave chief
[1:04:06] but just speaking of the wave chief
[1:04:09] a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:04:13] because what's coming back is not one
[1:04:15] man right
[1:04:16] right but it's a ground up
[1:04:18] mealed up heated up
[1:04:22] oh my raised up
[1:04:26] yeah are you with me now
[1:04:28] what has
[1:04:33] now it's become ground up heated up
[1:04:36] pressed together waved over the people
[1:04:38] yes in edible form
[1:04:42] the chief
[1:04:44] cannot lay on the ground
[1:04:46] it must be waived before the
[1:04:47] congregation
[1:04:48] and I'm here to tell you tonight the
[1:04:50] bread cannot lay on the ground
[1:04:53] it must be waived
[1:04:55] oh my yeah
[1:04:57] yeah now watch Leviticus 23 20. it tells
[1:05:00] us how these wave lows were to be waved
[1:05:02] he says and the priest shall wave them
[1:05:06] shall wave them with the bread of the
[1:05:09] first fruit so he went through and he
[1:05:10] showed and again we're taking a type out
[1:05:13] of this because there were other things
[1:05:15] that were waived it was a part of of uh
[1:05:17] of a goat or an ox or different kinds of
[1:05:20] things that were sacrificed there but
[1:05:22] now and he's talking about the lows he
[1:05:24] said the priest shall wave them with the
[1:05:26] bread of the first fruits for a wave
[1:05:29] offering before the Lord
[1:05:31] with the two lamps now you realize
[1:05:33] that the Sheaf would not be accepted in
[1:05:36] its in its form it was in by now it had
[1:05:39] to be bread
[1:05:41] because it was a different hour
[1:05:43] it was a different feast
[1:05:45] right you can't be in the form it would
[1:05:47] win down in
[1:05:49] and be in the form even it came up in
[1:05:51] but it come down on the day of Pentecost
[1:05:53] in a different form
[1:05:55] so now he comes in a different form now
[1:05:58] he said with the two Lambs they shall be
[1:06:00] holy to the Lord for the priest and you
[1:06:01] shall Proclaim on the south same day
[1:06:03] that it may be a holy convocation unto
[1:06:06] you so do no servile work therein in
[1:06:10] other words there won't be any labor
[1:06:11] done for anybody
[1:06:14] you're not going to work for your
[1:06:15] salvation
[1:06:17] it should be a statute forever in all
[1:06:18] your dwelling stretches Generations now
[1:06:20] watch
[1:06:22] it had to be waived I'm closing I'm
[1:06:25] warning you
[1:06:26] I'm about done
[1:06:27] now look
[1:06:29] the same priests that waved the sheath
[1:06:31] waved the loaf
[1:06:34] yes
[1:06:36] look here who wants to do it the priest
[1:06:39] it comes out waves the sheath he comes
[1:06:42] out 50 days later he waved a loaf
[1:06:45] what waved Christ what resurrected
[1:06:48] Christ he said if that same spirit
[1:06:51] that was in Christ
[1:06:53] so the spirit that was in him was the if
[1:06:57] we could say the anointing or the
[1:06:59] anointed one the priest that was waved
[1:07:02] him over the people
[1:07:03] and it was the spirit that fell on the
[1:07:06] day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:08] brother Branham types not only the wave
[1:07:10] Chief to the word but go look at it as
[1:07:12] the rising of the Sun and we'll get to
[1:07:13] it if time permits uh later on in
[1:07:16] another sermon but he talks about the
[1:07:18] wave sheep being the Holy Ghost being a
[1:07:19] type of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:21] and how could that be because there was
[1:07:23] actually the anointing that held the
[1:07:25] word was the priest the anointed one
[1:07:28] that held the word was the Holy Ghost
[1:07:31] right the same priests that waved the
[1:07:33] sheath waved the loaf and we have a
[1:07:35] priest
[1:07:36] how many know that tonight
[1:07:38] the Bible says seeing we have a great
[1:07:40] high priest
[1:07:42] let us hold fast our profession that
[1:07:45] great high priest that has passed into
[1:07:46] the heavens Jesus the son of God
[1:07:50] so I will say this tonight church if you
[1:07:52] can kind of just follow me where we're
[1:07:54] going let me go through the winnowing

[1:08:00] become bread yes let me go to the
[1:08:02] baker's oven

[1:08:08] level of cnh yeah but he wants to pick
[1:08:10] me up
[1:08:12] what's going to pick me up that same
[1:08:14] Spirit right
[1:08:16] oh my that same quickening power that
[1:08:19] same high priest

[1:08:25] before the people he's going to pick you
[1:08:27] up and wave you before the people here's
[1:08:29] a young couple that did it right and not
[1:08:32] only did it right but have the Holy
[1:08:34] Ghost and and are living according to
[1:08:36] what God told them to do here's here's a
[1:08:38] young man who was lost in sin who'd done
[1:08:41] everything wrong but now he's serving
[1:08:43] God with all of his heart here's a
[1:08:44] preacher who's preaching the word of God
[1:08:47] without changing it here's the Deacon
[1:08:49] who's doing what he hears a church
[1:08:50] that's doing what they're supposed to
[1:08:52] what is it it's the word coming into
[1:08:54] maturity if they're being picked up and
[1:08:57] waved not by a program of man not by
[1:09:01] denominational system yes yes but by the
[1:09:04] priest
[1:09:05] by the anointed one
[1:09:07] he said because I live
[1:09:09] you live also
[1:09:11] what is he saying here they are

[1:09:15] tell us in the bride coming of Christ

[1:09:42] of the sun he preaches that night does
[1:09:44] God ever change his mind about his word
[1:09:47] and he did something that kind of
[1:09:48] tickled me because I haven't seen it
[1:09:50] done in a long time but we used to do it
[1:09:51] back in the hole in his church we just
[1:09:53] didn't know what we were doing
[1:09:55] but brother Brandon picks up his
[1:09:57] handkerchief
[1:09:58] and he says well it's not a wave chief
[1:10:01] he said but they took from the body of
[1:10:03] Paul handkerchiefs and aprons he said so
[1:10:05] let's wave our handkerchiefs and he gets
[1:10:07] the people to worship Him and actually
[1:10:09] pick up their handkerchiefs how many
[1:10:11] Old-Timers you've probably seen it done
[1:10:12] back in the old church they'd take your
[1:10:14] handkerchief when they got real blessed
[1:10:16] and waved the handkerchiefs
[1:10:18] and brother Brandon said that was a wave
[1:10:20] offering
