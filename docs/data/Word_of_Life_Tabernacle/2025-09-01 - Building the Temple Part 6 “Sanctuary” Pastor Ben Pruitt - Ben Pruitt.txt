My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone. Oh, in Christ alone will I glory. For only by his grace I am redeemed.

Jesus rescues me. [Music] I know you're looking for an answer. Searching for some hope to hold. Empty hands will leave you waiting and praying for a miracle. Jesus hears your cry. He sees the walls that you can't climb. And he will heal your hurting soul and lead you safely to his home. When every mountain seems to hide. When every river looks to when my ship is lost at sea. Oh Jesus rescues me. My faith is strong. It carries me. Though sometimes weak, I still believe. My life is built on this desire. Through the blood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. My faith is strong. It's caring me. Though sometimes weak, I still believe. My life is built on this desire. Through the blood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. My life it's built on this desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. [Applause] Let's stand together. We enjoyed our specials this morning. Aren't you thankful?

Amen. Are you ready for the word of the Lord? Amen. You You've worshiped the Lord. Amen. And I it's a preparation to go into battle. Brother Bram taught us that when we sing songs, we're we're getting in the spirit to where we could actually go forth and we can we can whoop every devil this morning. When you when you sing songs to him, Amen, you're just getting your morale all built up. &gt;&gt; Where you can get ready to worship God in the in the way that he would have it to be this morning. Amen. Do you believe he's here? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, you say, "Well, I don't feel him." Well, I guarantee you he's here this morning because you're here. And if you're here, there's a promise that he's here. Aren't you thankful for it? Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning. Amen. I know this is kind of an altar call song, but I believe if he's here, I don't want him to pass me by. How about you this morning? I wonder if we could just make out our prayer this morning as the word goes forth. Lord, don't pass me by. Wall on others. Thou art calling. Do not pass me by. I want us to sing this with all of our hearts as our pastor comes to bring the word now. Amen. If you and if this is your prayer, I want you to just put a hand up to him. Oh, pass me not. Oh gentle save, won't you hear my humble cry? Oh, why all mothers thou are calling? [Music] Oh, do not pass me. If that's your prayer, sing it like you mean it now. Oh, I'm calling on you, Savior.

Lord, aren't you glad that Aren't you glad that he is there and he won't pass you by if you ask him? He said, "If you call on me, I'll I'll hear you." I'm so glad for that promise today. He would hear our prayers. Let's just go to him in prayer right now. Maybe you've got a need by you can make by way of uplifting hand, make known, and God knows your heart. He said, "I'll hear you when you call on me. My people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and hear from heaven. I will hear from heaven. I will heal their land. We believe that today. I believe that promise is true. Heavenly Father, Lord, you see the needs rep represented by hands all across the building. I pray God that you'd just move in a mighty way. I pray that Lord that that people would know that you're with them. Oh God, that you're here. You hear their prayer, Lord. You're not a God of far off, but your your arm is not short. you're able to answer, Lord, every request that we would make. I pray you'd meet every physical need, every spiritual need, every financial need. Lord, you you know how to do it. I pray you would do it today. We thank you for what you've done for us, Lord. We thank you for your goodness and your mercy. Lord, we give you praise this morning for the presence that we felt. I pray we would do nothing to grieve that, Lord. I pray that you'd move now in this service. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Isn't God good to us this morning? You're glad to be in the presence of the Lord, be in the house of the Lord. We want to go to Exodus 15:17. Exodus 15:17 and Isaiah 8. Isaiah 8:14. Exodus 15:17. And then Isaiah 8:14. trip. I didn't have that on on my body pack, so that's why that wasn't working. &gt;&gt; Sorry about that. Sometimes we we tend to make mistakes. I just have this on my mind. I got something on my heart today I want to get to. We won't get to it right at the beginning, but if you'll just bear with me and as we go into this, I just believe it'll be a blessing to us. Exodus 15:17. As we continue to talk about the building of the the temple, it says, "Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established." Isaiah 8:14 says, "And he shall be for a sanctuary." Oh, I'm thankful for that today. But for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, to both the houses of Israel, for a jin, that's a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He would be that stone that the builders rejected. Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning. A sanctuary is a consecrated place where deity dwells and where sacred objects are kept and worship takes place. A consecrated place for deity to dwell. It's actually a very strange uh thing if you think about it because it's men making a house, men who are fallible, men who make mistakes, men who are are limited by humanity making a house for a incomprehensible, infallible, omniresent God, &gt;&gt; right? And we're going to make a house for that God. And yet he allowed them to do that. What for? So they would have a place of worship, a place to worship. So we we know that uh our worship is in Christ. How many believe that today? That's the the only place where we can worship is in Christ. We found that our Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, was the sanctuary, the temple of God, dedicated for the purpose of redemption. In Acts 7:49, he said, "Heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool." He said, "What house will you build me? Sayeth the Lord. What is the place of my rest?" See, as magnificent as the temple was, as the sanctuary of that temple was, it was only a shadow of God's true sanctuary, who was his son. Hebrews 10:5, "Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice an offering that wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me." And so, that was his ultimate sanctuary was Christ. And so the pattern o of the sanctuary was important because it's what God had in his mind and it's a type or a shadow of what Christ would be. So we went through that how that uh the pattern was given to Moses and then it was given to David by inspiration of what God uh had showed him what what it would be. And I think I've got a picture on there of the of the of the tabernacle in the wilderness. This is actually what was showed to Moses and he built it exactly according to the specifications what God told him. You can see that there's three parts, three main parts to it. There's an outer court uh which is the part within the uh the courtyard there. There's an inner court which or a holy place which is inside the the tabernacle itself. And inside of that is a holiest place or a holy of holies. the holy place was where uh the ark of the covenant would be and and the cherubam and those things. So it just kind of keep that that in your mind as a mental picture this morning. Brother Brandham tells us he said now all the feast, the holidays, the tabernacle, all the wood, everything in the tabernacle, he said everything typed Christ. Everything typed Christ. He is the tabernacle of God. He is the sanctuary of God. Then I believe we ought to worship him in that place. Worship in his name this morning. That's what we ought to do. Hebrews chapter 9 and verse one says, "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary." He said, "For there was a tabernacle made. The first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shoebre which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all." So Paul is walking you through the the tabernacle. He said there was a tabernacle. He said then there was the candlestick and the table and the shoebread. He said and then another veil. He said and the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the covenant. It it was within this sanctuary that the supernatural happened all the time. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. There was supernatural on the outside, things that God would do to show himself present. But within the sanctuary was where the supernatural was taking place all the time. You realize that's a type of us, body, spirit, and soul that that it's actually on the outside we feel his presence, but sometimes we don't feel it. Sometimes we we we we're affected by different things, but on the inside, in the soul, in the holy place, that's where God dwells. And in there, there's supernatural all the time. No matter if you're sick, no matter if you're going through a hard time, no matter if it's difficult right now in the place where you're living in on the the soul's okay, I want to tell you that this morning. The holy place there there's a supernatural presence of God. The shikina dwells in the holy place, &gt;&gt; right? and and and when he is there, the the mana is kept fresh and the and Aaron's rod is alive and bringing forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word is a reality, not just dead letter inside the holy place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And over at the cherubams of glory shadowing the mercy seat, he said of which we cannot now speak particularly. And Paul goes on, I won't read all that chapter, but he goes on to say, "The priests went in once a year to offer a sacrifice which shows a way had not been made into the holy place because not all the people could go in." But tells us in I believe it's in Revelation chapter 5, he tells us that the people long to go in. He said they got so upset because they couldn't go in. They watched the priests go in and they long to do the same thing. But you and I can go in today. &gt;&gt; Even more than that, we must go in. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. So away had not been made into the holy place, but verse 11, but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Eternal redemption for us. for the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heer sprinkling the unclean sanctified through the purifying of the flesh. How much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God. The Lord give you a desire to do the right thing. And for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. I don't know if that means anything to you. You can look there sit there and say, "Brother Ben, what are you excited about? I'm excited that he is the temple. I'm excited about the fact he is our tabernacle. He's the place where the presence of God is. And if he is in my heart, then I become the tabernacle of God." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. He is the true tabernacle, the sanctuary of God. Colossians 2:9 says, "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily, &gt;&gt; not just a part of God, a portion of God, all of God." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, the tabernacle, as we said in Exodus, have been built by the hands of fallible men. Yet, we know that Jehovah was pleased to dwell in that place. How &gt;&gt; how do we know that? Because when they dedicated it, &gt;&gt; when they finished the work, his shikina presence came down and dwelt in that tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, if it hadn't happened, all their preparation would have been in vain. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to me this morning and listen close. We can we can live a good life. if we can pay our tithes, go to church and do everything just right, but and everything think we think we got everything just the way he wants it. But if that shikina presence doesn't come down and indwell our hearts, then we need to we need to go back and find out because there's something there that's not right or or or he would come down and indwell it. And most of the time what it is, it's not a lack of works because you can't work your way in, but it's a lack of faith of really surrendering and believing and giving our all to God. &gt;&gt; Because when we do exactly what he tells us to do, when we obey the word, brother said, full obedience to the word of God, to the full word of God entitles us to the token. So if we follow the pattern and believed on Christ, then we must have the Holy Spirit indwelling us. And and if we don't, it's usually because, you know, there's something there. There's some there's some stubbornness in our heart, &gt;&gt; right? And I'm just going to &gt;&gt; We talked about election and predestination on Wednesday night. And those of you that were here, you can go and listen to it. And we talked about how you can't be lost and all of those things. Now, we're going to take this morning. I'm going to challenge you just a little bit &gt;&gt; because there's got to be, if you are the elected, you're going to follow the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. We're we're the elect who follow the word &gt;&gt; and and and so we got to keep the word and and and and usually it's a stubbornness in our heart that doesn't allow that presence of God to come in. But I just want to say this morning, Lord, help me to surrender. Help me to give in. Help me to help me to walk but to say Lord whatever you want me to do whatever you desire in your temple whatever you want me to do for work whatever you want me to do with my family whatever you want me to do at church whatever you want me to do that's what I want to do Lord I'm tired of living my own life I'm tire come on church I'm tired of just being what I want to be but I want to surrender to you so that shina presence that presence of God can come and dwell in my heart. &gt;&gt; He will not make his sanctuary in a place where his word is not kept. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Matthew 15:9. But in vain they do worship me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Their worship was not received. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because they would not keep the word. I know people think it's a light thing to just take the message and make it whatever they want to make it and make some doctrine out of it and and preach it when it's when brother Brandham didn't say it. It's not a light thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You might shout and run the aisles and speak in tongues, but the presence of God will not be there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Unless the word is being kept. &gt;&gt; In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. He will not make his sanctuary in a place where his word is not kept. Exodus chapter 40 and verse 33. Let's look at it now. As Moses had been shown the pattern and the people were willing to work and gave to for the work and all of these things and Moses finally gets it all put together, he reared up the court round about it. So he sets up the outside, if you can imagine, kind of like us setting up a tent to go camping, you know, and they set it all up, put poles on it. It was a tent and they put the poles up and and and made the courtyard and he set the court up and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now if if the next verse doesn't happen, this tabernacle is no better than any temple they left in Egypt. All right. All right. A &gt;&gt; and if the the presence of God doesn't come down, you see, because the the Israelites, they didn't have a God they could make. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a there's a great lesson here. &gt;&gt; The Israelites didn't have a God they could make &gt;&gt; and put in the tabernacle and worship. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; We don't either. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. We we don't get to just change the word however we want to because it feels better for us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. Well, it would be better for me in my life if I would just ignore that part of the word. We don't get to do that. &gt;&gt; And if we just trust him, he'd make things work out, &gt;&gt; right? But many times we get in a mess because we feel like we lack the faith or the confidence in God to bring us through. And so we do things that are outside of the word, &gt;&gt; thinking, well, that's the only way I can have my entertainment or that's the only way I can have fun or that's the only way I'll ever be happy. And so what we're doing, we're doing outside of the word &gt;&gt; when all he wants us to do is is is do our part and do what be be faithful to what we know. You don't have to know everything. Not everything is revealed to everybody. All you got to do is what you know to do. &gt;&gt; That's all you'll be all you'll be judged by. It's all that you'll be examined by when uh when he comes by is to see that you've done what you've been told to do. And so Moses finished the work. Now watch. And then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord &gt;&gt; filled the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can do all the singing. We can do all the preaching. We can do all the work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We can set get the microphone set right and the music right and everything else. But if the glory of the Lord doesn't come, &gt;&gt; what good is all of it? &gt;&gt; There's got to be something that can that can move people. Got to be something that can change their hearts. Got to be something that can that can make them obey the word. There's got to be something that'll bring them to Christ. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Here was the proof that the sanctuary was ordained of God. The tabernacle was the word manifested. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So he gave it to Moses. He revealed it to him. But the tabernacle was the manifestation of the revelation that Moses had. &gt;&gt; Right? Just like you, you young people, you're the manifestation of the revelation that Jesus had or or or that that we've been given of what a young person is. The revelation that you receive in your soul by the Holy Spirit. He gives that to you and then you become that. You become sweet and kind and caring and loving and and dress right and act right and do right. Why do you do that? Because you're the manifestation. Come on, church. The works don't save you, but it's a manifesting of his presence. It's showing that the word is there and it's working in your life. And then what does he do? He comes down and fills the tabernacle. He fills it with his glory. His shina presence comes down. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's proof that the word of God has ordained this tabernacle. Oh, I pray that this would be a church that the Lord of Lord ordained that the word of God has been preached in in its puress, in its fullness, so that the kind of presence of God could come down. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me this morning? &gt;&gt; This was proof that the sanctuary was ordained of God. The tabernacle was the word manifested. The same was true of Solomon's temple in First Kings chapter 8 and verse 10. It came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place. They'd come in with the come in with the ark of the covenant. They'd finished all the work. The the final piece of gold was laid and the wood and the stones that we talked about last week that were cut in different ways were all put together. And here they walked you into the temple if you can imagine what it was like. And they and the priests, there were certain priests, the the Kathites, I believe it was, that were called to carry the ark on their shoulder. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so they would carry the ark and and they and they and they brought it into the house of God. &gt;&gt; And they set it into the socket into the place that was prepared for it. And when they set it in the socket and walked back out of the holy of holies, &gt;&gt; the Bible says the cloud filled the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that the priest could not stand to minister because the because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then spake Solomon. The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in, &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Over time, the people disobeyed and went into idolatry. The temple was destroyed. The ark was lost. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice something. This is I'm not trying to make it mysterious, but I want to get to a point this morning when Zerubbabel rebuilt the temple. You remember the ark was lost, remember? And and and the Babylonians come and took away the things for the temple. They finally come and just tore it down. And and the prophet Haggi was there during the time Zerubbabel was rebuilding the temple. Now when when when he come to rebuild it, it was a it was a work of God. When Ezra was there and different ones, it was a work of God. &gt;&gt; God meant for it to happen. He made a way for it to happen. &gt;&gt; But yet in in the process of time, God was already pointing to something else. &gt;&gt; So this second temple &gt;&gt; would never have the glory in it. &gt;&gt; The shikina was never in the second temple. &gt;&gt; It was only in the first temple. But there's no record in scripture of the Shikina being in the second temple. But the prophet Haggi spoke of a time when the glory would return. Haggi 2:6. For thus sayith the Lord of hosts, "Yet once it is a little while. I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land." Because I'm sure there were people there that that even they could think back. They'd been told or maybe even some old enough to remember. We know that when the first temple was dedicated that the door shook &gt;&gt; at the presence of God. &gt;&gt; The post shook at the presence of God. When Isaiah saw the vision of it, hear the the glory of God and and the and the noise of the cherubam and and and the post shook at the in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; And here says, "Yet once I will shake the heavens, &gt;&gt; the earth, the sea, the dry land. &gt;&gt; I will shake all nations, &gt;&gt; and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house." Right. &gt;&gt; But as far as we know, that shikina was never in that second temple. What house is he talking about? He's speaking of a of a body he had prepared. &gt;&gt; Right? There was a body coming. He would shake all nations. He said, "I will fill this house with glory, sayith the Lord of host. The silver is mine. The gold is mine, sayith the Lord of host. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, sayeth the Lord of hosts. And in this place will I give peace, sayith the Lord of hosts." &gt;&gt; Y. Now look, we know as we've already said, Jesus was the sanctuary of God and he was not without the glory, right? It come down like a dove on him there when he walked in obedience into the water. The word coming to the word in the water come to the prophet and the word came down upon him. the the the spirit come down upon the word. And when he did, he was filled with the Holy Ghost, with the fullness of God, right? He was God. He was God as a baby in a manger, but he was filled with the fullness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Now look, Matthew 17:4, we find another place where you remember Jesus takes three disciples. He brings them up on the mountain and on Mount Transfiguration and and there's three that are there. There's Jesus and Moses and Elijah. And when Peter sees that, he said, "Let's build some temples." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But God didn't need any more earthly temples. &gt;&gt; He didn't need any more temples of stone, &gt;&gt; any more temples of wood. He didn't even He didn't even come down into the second temple. He said, "I got a temple." &gt;&gt; Right? Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter and Peter looks at him and says, "Lord, it's good for us to be here." He said, "If thou will, let's make here three tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Let's make three temples. One for thee, one for Moses, one for Elias." &gt;&gt; Oh, he didn't understand, did he? Just like a lot of people today that don't understand &gt;&gt; because they elevate a prophet or a preacher or a pastor to the position of Christ. &gt;&gt; Right? And and he's not they're not in the position of Christ &gt;&gt; because what happens while he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. He a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased hear you him. What was it? The glory coming down on the temple on the tabernacle was showing. This is my word. This is the one who kept my word. This is the one who's the the building that I have made &gt;&gt; to dwell in. &gt;&gt; This is my sanctuary. This is the place of my rest. When he died, the veil was rent. When Jesus died, the veil was written from top to bottom showing that second temple, remember, was the one that Zerubabel built or that uh Ezra built. And yet it was the it had been remodeled and made grand by Herod. &gt;&gt; He'd made it very beautiful, very large. So they called it Herod's temple. &gt;&gt; But the presence of God wasn't there. And when Jesus died, he went the veil from the top to the bottom. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they were even in the temple singing songs &gt;&gt; about how a lamb would come &gt;&gt; about the Messiah, how he would come, how he would be crucified. They sang, "My bones, they stare at me." And there he was on Calvary &gt;&gt; fulfilling the word. But they they were blinded for our sake, so they couldn't see it. So here he he he was showing that there was no visible presence of the Lord when the when the veil was rent. Not only was there no mercy, no presence, there was no ark, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The ark had been lost. &gt;&gt; So where there was no word, they made men's ideas and worshiped in tradition. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you know what happened in our day. &gt;&gt; What was the restoration of the word? It was the ark coming back into its place. It was the fullness. That's why the fullness of the word had to come. See, if the seventh seal's not open, if brother Brandon's ministry is not complete, then we're still waiting on the ark to be put down in its place. &gt;&gt; So, how could the glory of the Lord fall if the word's not been fully restored? But if the word has been fully restored, if he has found the faith, I if Malachi 4 has been fulfilled, then where are we at, church? We're right there. Oh, come on, church. where the presence of the Lord is &gt;&gt; living in the shina presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And and and here the mercy seat was was right there. There was no effective mercy seat in in the temple at that time. There was an empty &gt;&gt; oh God. An empty holy of holies. &gt;&gt; But the mercy seat was hanging between heavens and earth on a cross in plain view of the people. He's still in plain view today. If you want to receive him, you can receive him. You can have him for your healing. You can you can obtain it for your salvation &gt;&gt; by faith in Christ. &gt;&gt; He hung in plain view of the people and then he ascended and told the disciples what to do. Now watch what he told them. He didn't tell them to build a house. He didn't say, "Now I want to give you some plans and you're going to go build another church, build a temple." But what did he tell him to do? Luke 24:49, "Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you." He said, "The glory is going to come down." The shininess coming down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were in an upper room right there in the temple, but he wasn't going to come down into the holy of holies of the temple, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Where the veil covered it. He wasn't going to inhabit that physical temple. But there was 120 believers in that in that upper room. Hallelujah. When it filled their hearts, it filled the room. &gt;&gt; And church, the reason we feel him in the room is because he's filled the hearts of men and women and boys and girls who are here this morning. He's not just in the room. He's in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Yes. The shikina never filled Herod's temple, but it filled the hearts of 120 believers and filled the room that they were in. Acts 2:1, when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared on them cloven tongues like as a fire. What was that? It was the shikina presence of God. It was God separating himself into his believers began to he said and and and it said upon each of them they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. &gt;&gt; After the building was completed, it was oh my After the building was completed, what did he tell him to do? He said, "You're my building. You're my temples. You're my tabernacles. Go and wait for the Holy Ghost to fall." Now, we don't have to wait because the Holy Ghost is here. What do we have to do? Acts 2:38, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Solomon's, let's go back to Solomon's temple for a moment. The building was completed. It was just an empty building, though. It was beautiful. But it was empty. &gt;&gt; There was nothing in it but furniture. &gt;&gt; And yet Solomon had done all that he could do. &gt;&gt; There you go. Good. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says he said, "Now the great day of dedication come." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When they were going to dedicate this building for worshippers to worship something. Now without something there to worship, the building would have been in vain. &gt;&gt; But the building was now ready for dedication. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the Levites, as we said, went to the tabernacle where the ark was kept and they brought the word into its resting place. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon tells us the reason David the reason the ark the first time everything failed. Remember the man touched the ark and David didn't consult the prophet and he shouted and he he had a good revival but nothing happened, &gt;&gt; right? He was trying to do God a service without it being the will of God. But if you go down in that sermon, brother Brandon said there wasn't a place prepared for it. &gt;&gt; He said there had to be a place and Solomon's temple was the place. So there had to be a place prepared. So now they would finally enter the place that was prepared for it. He said and they picked it up from its tents. They started marching. The trumpets sounding, the sultry playing, the smoke going up from the dead animals that was being sacrificed before Jehovah down through the building of dedication that came till they brought it to its resting place where it fit down into the sockets of the great huge place that had been set for it. And when it fit down and finally come to its resting place, the ark, &gt;&gt; the Bible said the Lord descended down upon the place till it filled the entire temple. See, faith comes by hearing of the word. You may sit here for service after service, but one day when the word comes to its resting place and it really gets down in your heart, it becomes more than a head knowledge, but it becomes a heart knowledge. What is that? That's when the presence of God can come down. The word had reached its final resting place, the pillar of fire. He said come in in such great glory of God till the ministers could not minister anymore because of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand taught us that was the true capstone of the of the temple was the shikina presence because the building was incomplete without the presence of God. So Stephen when he was preaching and we read it earlier, what house will you build me? What is the place of my rest? And brother Brandham always takes that to Hebrews 10:5 he said how beautiful Hebrews 10:5 but a body hast thou prepared me showing that God was going to dwell in a body and when this body had been made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed there was coming forth then God came to his own body which was his bride &gt;&gt; so where where did the temple move to or the tabernacle the sanctuary of God it was no longer hanging on a cross but the sanctuary &gt;&gt; was 120 believers And every believer who's come that same way since then &gt;&gt; they become you become the sanctuary of God. God come to his own body which was his bride. There had been 120 temples that God had created was ready for dedication had got all their unbelief beat out of them. Amen. But in the preparation time as we're preparing this temple for the Holy Ghost they all the unbelief beat out of them. They gathered in the upper room and waited for 10 days for dedicational service. Then when completely surrendered, God came down again in the shakina glory and filled all the house where they were sitting. Listen to me church. Many times we think, well, why doesn't the presence of God move? Why don't we see more prayer or worship in the service? Why don't why don't I feel better about going to the house of God? Listen, many times we're miserable in the house of God because there's something we haven't surrendered yet. There's something there and you're you're probably thinking of it right now. You just need to let it go. You need to let God have his full room in your heart, in your house. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If there's thoughts that exalt themselves against the knowledge of Christ, you need to bring them into captivity this morning and say, "I want to be a temple filled with the Holy Ghost." If the Satan tells me I can't make it, I believe the word says I can. If he tells me there's no hope, I believe the word says there is hope. If he tells me there's no forgiveness, I believe he's forgiven my sins &gt;&gt; on Calvary. If he tells me I can't, oh, come on, church. He tells me I can't make it. I know I'm going to make it. &gt;&gt; That anxiety and depression exalts itself against God. We ought to let go of that thing. &gt;&gt; We're holding on to it many times out of stubbornness of our own heart, saying, "Well, I I I just, you know, I'm afraid. I'm afraid." Just let that go and say, "Lord, I'm going to enjoy the house of God. I'm going to worship God no matter how I feel. No matter what's going on in my life, I'm going to love you anyway. I'm going to worship God anyway cuz he's worthy of my praise. &gt;&gt; So when his shikana presence drops in is when we surrender. &gt;&gt; Revival don't come by fast music or hyping people up. &gt;&gt; Revival doesn't come from from strobe lights and smoke machines. Revival comes when the word is preached and people surrender to it and people say, "Not my will but thine be done." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did God do? He said like the ark dropping into its proper sockets for the message of that day, God dropped back into its proper channel. Not into a denomination or into a building made with hands, but into the heart of men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He dropped in his place for the last day. He said, "Which said the prophet Joel, it shall come to pass in the last day. I'll pour out my shikina upon all flesh. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Your young men shall dream dreams. The old men shall see visions." God will come to his came to his resting place. Hallelujah. Where he finds rest, not in a building, but in the heart of his people, he finds rest. Brother Brandham talks about another temple that was made. He talks about Nimrod's temple. He He made a tower that would reach into the heavens. He thought he'd make a temple that God couldn't ignore. Oh my. But when God, you know, when that happened, what happened? God said, "I'm going to confuse their language." &gt;&gt; And it brought a confusion of tongues. That's Babylon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But when God come to his own temple, hallelujah. He didn't bring a confusion of tongues, but he brought an understanding of tongues, &gt;&gt; he brought interpretation. Hallelujah. So, brother Brandon said the miracle was the hearer, right? Because he said that they heard him speak in their own language. &gt;&gt; That's why he said to this is tough because some people want to go back to a place where everybody's just just speaking in tongues all the time. Listen, I believe in speaking in tongues. I believe there's a prayer language that you don't even understand. doesn't have to be interpreted. But in the house of God, Paul said not to do that. &gt;&gt; Right? Because brother Brandham taught us that was Babylon again. &gt;&gt; It was a sign of judgment. &gt;&gt; People think it's a sign of God's presence. It was actually a sign of judgment. The temple built in the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not according to the word. It was a sign of confusion of tongues. But when that when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost, it did not confuse tongues. &gt;&gt; That's good. Come on. or bring some kind of a vague message. But it was some it was Peter's sermon that he was preaching everyone heard in their own language. &gt;&gt; Brother said when God come to his own temple, the church, the people when he come to them, he filled the temples that were dedicated just like he did at Solomon's temple. He filled it not with creeds, not with denominations, but with himself. He filled the temple with the shikina glory. So did he do on the day of Pentecost? He filled them 120 pe temples. It was up there with himself with the Holy Ghost itself. The shikina glory broke through upon them. And then what Nimrod failed to do, build a temple where every man spoke contrary to what he could understand. God came down and with one Galilean language made every man understand what he was saying. And they know it was brought. What Pentecost failed to do with a confusion of tongue. This message has come and brought a clarity to the word. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me now. I I I don't want you to take that. I'm against tongues. Somebody broke out in tongues. believe in the ser I say praise God &gt;&gt; I'm not against that at all &gt;&gt; but that's not our focus in this age &gt;&gt; God can use that brother Brandon said it was the mean times it was God &gt;&gt; God that used it but it wasn't his his perfect way for the sermon to be 10 minutes long &gt;&gt; and the tongues just be going off in the church &gt;&gt; right it wasn't God's way it was confusion it was Babylon &gt;&gt; Amen So he said the shikina of glory broke through upon him. What Nimrod failed to do. Hallelujah. God came down and did. There is God to his temple. God to his dedicated temple. Not to a man-made achievement. Not to what man done. But what God did himself. Hallelujah. But God always fills his temple at the day of dedication. He fills his temple. He fills it with himself. The same thing today. God will fill every temple. Someone say it with me. Every temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him. any persons that will. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If you start thinking, well, I need more of God. Well, who doesn't need more of God? &gt;&gt; Right? We all feel that way, don't we? Many times we need more of God. We need his presence. We need his glory. We We need him to be We need more of God. I think we could all say that this morning. Every one of us, if we had an altar call for that, more of God, we we should probably all be in the altar because we all need more of God. But if you want more of God, you need to dedicate yourself. Yes. &gt;&gt; Dedicate yourself to the things of God. Dedicate yourself to the word of God. Dedicate your temple. &gt;&gt; You can't go around all week &gt;&gt; living in an undeedicated manner to the word &gt;&gt; and then expect that to get fixed on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And then go back to it again. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching at anybody. I don't You know, I don't do that. I'm preaching to myself, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, we I'm a human being. I live in this world. I know what it's like. I I live in the same world you do. I I I I I There's some There's some sports that I like. There's some entertainment and things that's good. That's That's not filthy that that I like to enjoy. And I enjoy going to the theme park like anybody else. I enjoy uh fishing and hunting and or not really hunting so much as fishing, but I enjoy doing things and and doing all but listen, if we're all week we're dedicating ourselves to those things, how do we expect to be a temple filled with the Holy Ghost? He can come down on at some point. We got to dedicate ourselves to the house of God, to the things of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "God will fill every temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him. Any persons that will." &gt;&gt; He said, "The temple is not this little building here. The temple is not the one in Salt Lake City. The temple is not the one in Rome. The temple is you. &gt;&gt; You are the temple that God wants to dwell in and express himself through it." that all nations might know him. You are living images of God that God wants to work through in any time that any man or any woman will forget all the falsehoods that they've heard in the world and come back to the line of the scriptures and we'll keep in line. Oh my, what is that? Keeping the pattern that we've been given. If we'll come back to the original dedication, we'll open up our hearts and empty ourselves. God in dedication as we give it to him, we'll fill our temple with his shikina glory. Then the living God will be moving in a living church among a living people. We'll spread forth his glory and together someday one being this way, one this way, one one part of the country, she'll come together to make up the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll be caught up in the air to meet him. What is that? We're dedicating ourselves to him so we can be in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I I don't know about you, but I want to be his sanctuary today. Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to be his sanctuary. You young men. I when I was 12 years old, I wanted to be a sanctuary. I hadn't even received the Holy Ghost yet, but I wanted it so bad. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be a sanctuary. You young ladies, you can be a sanctuary. I remember at 16, we got 16 year olds here and 18 year olds, 17 year olds. I I remember when I was that age and I wanted to be the sanctuary of God, when I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I I you know, I had more time then. I could pray and dedicate myself to the things of God. I'd go almost every day and and have nothing else to do. And so I I'd go and and and dedicate myself to the to the prayer and things. Listen, I'm not saying that because I'm saying that because there was a desire inside of me to worship God and to do those things. But you can do that, too. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's not Listen, what we have today is not because of talent. What we're seeing today, the the fruit that we're seeing is not because that the musicians are talented and the preachers talented and and everything is a bunch of talent here in the church. That's not what it is. We love the talent, but that's not why we have what we have. We have what we have. We have the services we do because somebody dedicated themselves to the work of the Lord. Somebody got down to business with God and said, "I'm going to I'm going to start living for him. I'm going to do what's right." Listen, I failed many times. I've messed up many times, but I'm still dedicated to his word. I want to do the right thing. What about you young people? Why don't you dedicate yourself this morning to the word of the Lord? I'm going to quit listening to that music. I'm going to quit going on them websites. I'm going to quit going to that place. I'm going to dedicate this temple to the worship of God. &gt;&gt; Good. Yes. He can fill your h your heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he will if you'll fully dedicate yourself &gt;&gt; to him. How do we become his sanctuary today? Acts 238. I've already quoted it to you. If you'll do these things, repent and be baptized, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. The glory will come to that predestined temple. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the key to that is repentance, surrender to the word. Brother Brandham taught us that when a man is saved, he has a little button. Brother Brand said about like the white button on his shirt, a button of light. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That comes into his heart. Now that's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. It is when you receive Christ. That's the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; working in you. But it has to work through justification and sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then baptism after baptism &gt;&gt; because he's not stopping, he's growing, right? Brother Brandon said that light as it grows, it pushes out everything that's unlike him. And so that's why it's so much easier to serve God at the beginning because the light in you is so small. You can just rejoice in that light, right? Brother Jesus even talked about that. He said, "You saw John. You rejoiced in his light, but a greater light has come." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What happens is that light pushes up against our carnal nature. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And when it pushes up against our carnal nature, we start to respond and we start to hold on to things &gt;&gt; that we don't we shouldn't hold on to. &gt;&gt; And and and so he'll stay there. He's not going to leave us. But why not just give him full possession? &gt;&gt; Good. Huh? &gt;&gt; Give him full possession. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham taught us a man is made up in the system of a tabernacle. &gt;&gt; In the outer courts, then in the holy place, and the holiest of holies, the shakina glory on the inside, the veil. He said there were five gates each to the body and to the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. See, taste, feel, smell, and hear in the body and imaginations and conscience and so forth. In the spirit, memory in the spirit. Then he said on the inside he has only one gate, one entrance to go into the shina glory where God can enter into him &gt;&gt; and take over in the control tower and that way is through self-will. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, he does not force himself. The amazing thing about predestination is God elects his children but does not force himself into their heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he's so great. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. And and how does he do that? And I' I've given this to you before, but it's a lot the way that we You want to keep your children around. I'm preaching to myself here, too. I got children, you know, a kid turns 18, they're old enough to leave the home, &gt;&gt; huh? Appreciate that sign back there, Peter. That old enough to They make signs back there because I can't hear them say, "Amen." But they're old enough when, you know, turn 18, they're old enough to leave the house. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You old enough to just go out and go out in the world? &gt;&gt; They are. &gt;&gt; What makes a kid want to stay in and try to do what's right? &gt;&gt; Huh? Are you kids going to face that decision one day? &gt;&gt; You can't make them not do it. &gt;&gt; You can't force them to stay home. You can't force them not to s go out and sin, do those things. &gt;&gt; Can't do it. How do you get them to stay home? I always admired sister Samra because her her kids never wanted to leave the house, you know. &gt;&gt; But evidently there was a place there that there was something there that they there was love there. &gt;&gt; So what do you do? Brother Brandon said make your home a happy place, &gt;&gt; a place they want to be at. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They want to bring their friends to, &gt;&gt; right? A place that don't mean you give into everything. It means you keep it orderly. You keep it nice. You keep the atmosphere right. You don't be critical of every little thing. And Right. Keep it nice. He said, &gt;&gt; "Keep it nice for them." And &gt;&gt; let all the bad attitudes go and say, "What? What are you doing? You're you're Listen, I know my kids can get old enough to leave, but I can't imagine them doing it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I just want to overwhelm them with love and with with teaching and with the things that God I just want to overwhelm them with love until they know some that they're loved, that they would never want to go against the word, that God loves them, that I love them, their mother loves them. I hope you hear me today. It it's not that I'm forcing them to stay, but I'm just it's just so much love that they can't go. They don't want to go. They want to I don't mean that they have to stay home, but they want to stay in the house of God. They want to stay in fellowship with God's people. How do we do that? By overwhelming love. How did God do it for you? He elected you. He called you. He predestinated you. And he overwhelmed you &gt;&gt; until all you could do was respond, "Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh, I I want my self-will to just be an open door. Yes, Lord. Whatever you want for me, I want to give to you. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the only way in is through self-will." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If any man will come after me," in other words, let's say it this way, "If any man will be a tabernacle, a sanctuary for for deity, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; let him take up his cross daily &gt;&gt; and follow me. He has made a way as the great high priest and entrance into the holy place. Now we have to go in. Brother said once was death to go in. Now it's death to stay out. The whole mercy seat is sitting in plain view. Anybody can see it. The veil is rent. Glory to God. The whole mercy seat comes into plain view. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If we are his sanctuary in Listen, now think about that for a minute. This is where I wanted to come to. If we are his sanctuary, then everything in the that was in the sanctuary is in reality in us. Everything that was a type in the sanctuary is in a reality in us. What did the sanctuary contain? The sanctuary contained the ark and the cherubam. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. Oh my. I believe there's worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's worship in the sanctuary. Yes. &gt;&gt; In the sanctuary was the ark &gt;&gt; containing three things. The tablets of stone, the brother said that was the two covenants, old and new testament, the written word, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't just dead letter because the shikina was there. &gt;&gt; Oh church. &gt;&gt; So in the sanctuary, so we could say it this way. In your heart is the word. &gt;&gt; If you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, in your heart is the word. And the word is not just not just dormant, but the word is a living thing to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In your heart is the golden bowl of mana, the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why Come on, church. You say, "I got the Holy Ghost." But you got no desire for the message of the hour. I wonder about that. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in your heart, in the sanctuary is the golden bowl of mana. &gt;&gt; Right. The hidden mana. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In your heart. That's what in your heart and your you you want that. You desire that. &gt;&gt; In your heart is Aaron's rod that budded. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh my. In you is the word. &gt;&gt; In you is also the power to make that word live. &gt;&gt; So that you wouldn't be just a dead dry stick, but that you would be Oh, if I never preach another sermon, I want you to hear this this morning. In you is the in you is the word and the power to make that word live. He said, "I'm waiting on the church to have a revival." Brother Brandham taught us. He said, he said, "That's not the revival for you." He said, "You pray for your church to have a revival. That's not the revival for you." He said, "But you get down on your knees and you get in your prayer closet and you say, Lord, make me the revival. &gt;&gt; Make me the revival. Let me be a burning fire." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me be a sanctuary for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you are the sanctuary, &gt;&gt; see, above that ark was a was a a shelf, a seat. a place where blood could be put, a lid if you will, on the ark of the covenant called the mercy seat. Oh my. Wood overlaid with cold deity, deity, and humanity. the mercy seat. Brother Brandham said, "Now, if if you're the sanctuary, all these things are represented in you. Then the mercy seat is represented in your heart." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Now the mercy seats in the heart, the seat where the shining forth of his glory in all of his children, the shakina glory in the human heart." Now, brother Bram goes to a blackboard and uses a blackboard. I don't feel bad. I know some people don't like uh powerpoints. I don't I just put quotes and scriptures on it mainly. But brother Brandham used a blackboard. And so he had a brother showed me a quote the other day where brother Brandham talked about doing some kind of digital. He didn't say digital, but he said some kind of electric thing. He said where he could just write it and it would come up on the on the screen. He was way ahead of his time. He was looking for PowerPoint, you know, but brother Brandon used a blackboard and he began to use his blackboard and he talked about he said, "How do you come through it into that through these different systems?" So he's talking about what we saw the the outer courts the inner courts the holy of holies he said through self-will. So how do you get on that inside part? Through self-will. Comes into here, through here, comes out what? Shakina glory. What is the shakina glory? It's God's presence. When a man's walking or a woman, he's reflecting the shakina glory. &gt;&gt; So we know that a man, can I have just a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; We won't have a second service today. A man who has entered the Holy of Holies is forever changed. &gt;&gt; How many know that? &gt;&gt; Let's not think about time for a minute. Let's think about the word &gt;&gt; just a minute. &gt;&gt; It's forever changed. &gt;&gt; See there when Moses remember what he did the here was an attraction on the mountain? It was a a burning fire, a bush that didn't burn. And he begins to go towards it and a voice spoke and said, "Take off your shoes. You're standing on holy ground." Brother Brandon taught us, he said, he didn't take off his hat. He took off his shoes &gt;&gt; because that's what the voice said to do. So when he come in full obedience, the shikina invited him into its presence &gt;&gt; so the word could be revealed to him and his purpose could be revealed. So we find that when he come in there, he went in there broken down, running from God, backsliden, 80year-old man, comes out on fire. His face changed. Everything about him changed. Why? He had been in the presence, Brother Brandon said, five minutes in the presence of that burning bush did more for him than 40 years &gt;&gt; in a seminary. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So the the presence of that burning bush changed him. But we know one day, listen, when you come in the presence of God, we appreciate that so much. But one day the mercy seat will become a judgment seat. How many know that? &gt;&gt; I believe that's when the bride is taken off the earth. I don't believe as long as we're here that the mercy seat can be taken away. We've already shown you the mercy seat's in the heart of the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the mercy seat, the mercy seat's in your heart. But now, one day the Bible says, "He that thou letteth will let until he be taken out of the way." That's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And then the Antichrist comes in. So one day the mercy seat becomes a judgment seat. Now hang with me just for a moment. Look at Revelation 15 and verse 5. Everybody okay this morning? &gt;&gt; If you're asleep, I'll try not to wake you up. Revelation 15:5. After that, I looked and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was open. So now watch, he's tying this. The temple, the tabernacle, the of testimony is what they had in the wilderness. So he said there was one in heaven and it was open because remember what they made on the earth was just a type of what was in heaven. He said, "And the seven angels come out of the temple having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, having their breasts girdled with golden girdles. And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God who liveth forever and ever. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. Now it's interesting brother Brandham takes that and and brother Brandon talks about how the sanctuary became smoky. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But it wasn't at the presence of God arriving, &gt;&gt; but it was when he was leaving, &gt;&gt; right? So he lives. Oh my, &gt;&gt; he lives. It was his presence. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So do you realize this morning that most people are not God conscious? &gt;&gt; They're they're not conscious of the shikina. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it didn't bother the Babylonians any to walk right into the Holy of Holies &gt;&gt; and tear it up. &gt;&gt; Destroy the artifacts, destroy the the art, carry it away. The Philistines didn't bother them until things started to die and idols started to fall. &gt;&gt; But it didn't bother them, you know, to do it. It didn't bother offend their conscience any. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? They were not God conscience, &gt;&gt; right? That's why people can sit in church and the presence of God can be there, just sitting there chewing gum or whatever they want to do, you know, and just keep on doing what they're doing &gt;&gt; because there's no God consciousness. &gt;&gt; But but yet, oh God, there's going to come a day when the presence of God is lifted. &gt;&gt; The shiny is lifted from the earth. I'm so glad I won't be here. I don't believe I'll be here. But brother Brandham taught us and he actually picks up on something Brother Neville said. Brother Neville made the statement that most people won't even know &gt;&gt; that the mercy seat has been abandoned. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; This ought to show us the value of being a Christian of hearing the message of the hour of knowing that that we're in the fullness of the word has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Most people won't even know because they never had his presence indwelling in their life. So that's why they can do the worst things. They can never repent of it. Go on and pretend to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They don't even know when he's not there. &gt;&gt; That's like Samson &gt;&gt; when he goes when he gets his hair cut off. &gt;&gt; He's gotten so familiar &gt;&gt; with the presence of God, he just assumes it'll always be there. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he went out as at other times before and he wished not. He didn't know that the presence of God had departed from him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He didn't even know it. He was beaten and tied up and his eyes were put out &gt;&gt; because he didn't know. &gt;&gt; He laid in the lap of Delilah for so long that he'd become numb to the absence of the Holy Spirit. like a person would sit in a catatonic state &gt;&gt; maybe on a Netflix binge or something like that and or video gaming and just sit there wouldn't even know if someone come in the house &gt;&gt; or out of the house right &gt;&gt; cuz they never had his presence indwelling their life said they don't know the Holy Spirit so they won't know when it's gone and they'll just be going right on just the same. &gt;&gt; When the last one is sealed into the body of Christ, they'll still be going on trying to bring converts to it. &gt;&gt; Do you realize, church? I hope there we want to spread the message everywhere it'll go, but there will still be people trying to get books printed and tapes sent out and &gt;&gt; after. He said they'll still be trying to bring people into the body of Christ, trying to bring people to the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; not even knowing it's already gone, &gt;&gt; trying to bring converts to it because they don't know what it is. And their formal religions will continue on just like they were. &gt;&gt; God have mercy on us, brother. He said, I'd like to live in this life. Could this be our prayer this morning as we're coming down to a close? Could this be our prayer? God have mercy on us. I would like to live in this life and my desire to lift even the least bit of his grieving. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll know it in my heart. &gt;&gt; See, brother Ben, can you grieve the Holy Ghost as a Christian? Absolutely you can. Cuz Paul says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby you're sealed till the day of your redemption." &gt;&gt; You can grieve the Holy Ghost. Listen. He said, "I want to live so close to him. I'll know it in my heart. I should do something that would grieve him. I'd be able to feel it." I know that people say feelings don't count, but I want to be able to know. &gt;&gt; If I get cold and hard and critical, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Gossiping and carrying on. &gt;&gt; I want to be able to know. &gt;&gt; If I get to dabbling in things of the world that aren't right, &gt;&gt; if I get to doing something that's not right. If I get to not treating my wife respectfully or or you you husband respectfully. Come on, church. I want to know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to be sensitive enough to the presence of God that I know he's not there anymore. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says he flies up when we take on a wolf nature. He flies up in the gable end of our soul. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll know it in my heart. If I should do something to grieve him, I'd be able to feel it &gt;&gt; just in a moment." Let alone his absence. &gt;&gt; See, he said, "Just if I grieved him." He said, "I'd want to know it." Let alone his absence. I don't want to be here when he's not here. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all struggle with whether or not you have even have the Holy Ghost. And you struggle with that and think, "Do I even have it? Is there even any, you know, if you were did without it for a while?" If you're a real Christian, you'd know it. &gt;&gt; You'd know it. But yet, we can get so numb to it. You don't realize all he does for you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You don't recognize what he keeps you from. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We all don't. Or we would value it more. &gt;&gt; We'd value time in his presence. &gt;&gt; Not get so anxious to get up and go, &gt;&gt; but value the time &gt;&gt; that we have to worship. &gt;&gt; Right. If we really recognize how important it was, he said, "I don't want to be here when he's not here. I want to be gone then." Yes, sir. For there will be no blood on the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; It'll be dark and smoky and black. The sanctuary will have no lawyer there &gt;&gt; to plead our case at that time. And you know something? If I ever get ar I've never been arrested. I've never been questioned. I've never been pulled out of my vehicle. But if I ever did, you know, they ask these people, "Do you want a lawyer?" No, no. I'll answer questions. Give me a lawyer. &gt;&gt; I don't like lawyers, but give me a lawyer. &gt;&gt; I want somebody on my behalf. I don't want to represent myself. I want somebody who's trained to do that to represent me. Don't you realize the Holy Ghost is your attorney? &gt;&gt; And when the Holy Ghost leaves the earth, there'll be no more lawyer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I need my pariclete. That's what that means. Our advocate, our lawyer before the father. I need my advocate with God. I need that. He said, "There'll be no more lawyer there to plead our case at that time." &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture says that the sanctuary was smoking. God, not with his presence arriving, but with his presence leaving. &gt;&gt; No blood on the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Then his judgment. I want to tell you this morning as the musicians come, without the presence of God, Aaron's rod is just a dead stick. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Without the presence of God, the mana is spoiled &gt;&gt; and we don't want to hear the message no more. We don't want to listen to it no more. Why the presence of God isn't there no more? &gt;&gt; What's happened? Have we out of stubbornness held on to things? You're making plans. I don't know who I'm talking to this morning, but you're making plans to do things you know are against the word. Well, when I go home or I go on vacation or this is the plan for my life and you know that's not what the word wants out of your life. Some of you young men, you know that you're sitting and think I'm going to be the next rock star. I'm going to be the next football player and you know that's not what God wants out of your life. You may be a football player, but listen, I don't see how I I know every young man wants to be in the NFL, but I don't see how you could live that life and be a Christian. I don't see it, church, not a real Christian. You want to grow up and do things, you need to surrender that to God. You let God have that. Some of you older people, you you you make you're about to make decisions and we sit there, we consciously make decisions that are against the word, and we think, well, I just get by with it. know there'll come a time you don't even know that the presence of God has departed. But if you can feel that this morning, if you can know that his presence, I I just feel it, but it's not like it used to be, then it's time to dedicate ourselves again in the house of the Lord. I know it's Labor Day weekend. I know we're about to go out and have some fun and eat some food and do some things. But I'll tell you this, we ought to have a time and dedication in the house of God that said, "Lord, help me that I'll keep your word. Help me that I'll do what the message teaches me to do. Help me that I will not leave your presence and it will not leave me. I don't want to grieve you, Lord, by my actions. Say, "Well, I deserve it." Oh, you don't know what you're doing to yourself. You don't know what you're doing to yourself. I deserve that cigarette. I deserve that grudge. I deserve that bitterness. You don't know what you're doing to yourself. See, without the presence of God, Aaron's rod is just a dead stick. Without his shikina presence, the mana is spoiled. And without his presence, the tablets are just words written on stone. But we want his presence every day in the sanctuary. And I believe if he's in this sanctuary, he'll fill the room that we're in so it could be a help to others maybe who need to enter in the room we are in and in our hearts. Would you just bow your heads with me today? I I know it's been somber and maybe not a a shouting thing, but this I have to preach what God puts on my heart. Are you drifting? I'm preaching to myself, too. Are you drifting? So easy to do in Leona. I know some of y'all are struggling. I know that. I Some people are struggling and just just to make it in life. Some people financially or maybe you take on too much and you're unable to do it all. I know people struggle. That don't mean you're drifting from God. But if you are drifting from God, can you feel that separation? See, in order to be a real Christian and live for God the way we ought to, do you realize what has to happen? The pain of the separation has to be more has to be greater than the pleasure of whatever we want to do, whatever the flesh wants to do. Oh, I'd just live like the world. I'd just be a regular guy, but but Lord, I don't want to be separate from you. I'd treat my wife in that way, but I Lord, I don't want to be separate from you. Treat my husband that way, but I don't want to be separate from you. I'd tell them stories and gossip and hold that grudge, but Lord, I don't want to be separated. Can Can you feel that today? Is there something in your heart? You can know that there's a just not what it used to be, but you're a Christian. You got a way back. A way has been made into the shakina glory. Why don't you just walk back in? The door itself will open up your heart that Lord, I'll do whatever you want me to do. I'll go wherever you want me to go. I'll be whatever you want me to be. I'll pray you grant it today. Lord, raise your hand if that's your desire today. I trust that it will be if you need to pray. The altar's open. We'll take time with you today and pray. Whatever it is that you have need of, we'll take the time to do it today. I just giving him all my heart today and pray that God would just would just make a difference. Lord, make a difference in our services. Make a difference if I if I come separated a little bit. Lord, change me. Make me new. God bless those hands. I'll be praying. And I'm praying for myself, too. It's easy to get cold. It's easy to get busy and get cold and get separated. Lord, help us never to do that. Oh, Lord Jesus, in my own heart, Lord, I need you today. I need your presence. I need you to fill this sanctuary, Lord, with the glory. I felt it before. I know what it's like to stand there and and and shake under the presence of God and feel your presence. I know what it's like to feel the glory in my heart, my soul. I know many of these people do as well. I pray God you'd bring back the new again. Bring back that that that that presence, Lord, that we can know that you're there. We know that you're always with us. You'll never leave us. You predestined us, but Lord, we want to fulfill your word. We want to be a sanctuary for you. We want to be a dwelling place for deity so that we can speak, Lord, and our words will mean something. So that we can speak and it'll be as you speaking. I pray you'd grant it today. Lord, I pray. Lord, I surrender myself. We surrender as a congregation, Lord. We want you in our lives. We need you in our presence, oh God. We need you in the church. We don't need anything else, Lord, more than we need you. I pray you granted today, Lord Jesus. I pray you'd go in every home, Lord. As they go, if they go on vacation, whatever they do, I pray, God, that you would just move in every home. Lord, if the men are out hunting or fishing or whatever they're doing, I pray your presence would be with them. Lord, I pray, Lord, if as they're going to work as a Lord, some of our ladies even have to keep the house and work. I pray God you would help them. I pray you'd heal those that are sick, Lord, Satan attacking their body. I pray God that that presence that Shakina would settle down over the sanctuary of their soul, Lord, and that they they would know that everything's okay. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. Oh, we thank you for it. I pray you'd move for this congregation, for the people, Lord, for those who are in need. I pray you'd meet their needs today. Lord, we don't want to put down anybody or preach hard, but Lord, we want your presence. We want to do what you said to do in your word. Preach your word so your presence will be here. I pray you grant it, Lord. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Lord. Oh, there's nothing like the presence. [Music] Hallelujah. Nothing like fulfill our prayers this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am free. Hallelujah. Can we sing it together now? In his presence. &gt;&gt; If you have a need, we'd be glad to pray with you today. I am here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In his presence, you just put every other thought aside. Just become a for today or fill my with your presence. &gt;&gt; I'm not the same. Oh God, I'm changed forever in his presence. There's healing in the presence. We need a breaking time, a breaking of the presence &gt;&gt; so we can have his presence again in our hearts and our homes. Don't you want to have that joy in your heart? Don't you want to have joy in the house of the Lord? Why don't you just surrender to him today? There's healing in the presence. Oh, Lord. Healing in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I'm singing today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, God. Lord, I pray for you. &gt;&gt; Well, I am free [Applause] his presence and I am healed. [Applause] in his presence. [Music] I'm forgi [Music] Lord. I'm not the same.
