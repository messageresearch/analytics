the honor in jesus name amen amen my goodness i believe we could go home and say it's been good to be in the house of the lord amen let's turn to second kings chapter 13 and verse 14 second kings 13 and 14. but joel if you can give me any more monitor up here i'm not wearing that ear monitor you'll have to have them hot anyway for brother wendell second kings 13-14 now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said oh my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the king's hands and he said open the window eastward and he opened it and then elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt smite the syrians in effect till thou have consumed them and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou should have smitten five or six times then has thou smitten syria until thou hast consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice and jehoiash the son of we're skipping down to verse 25 jehoiash the son of jehoiaz took again out of the hand of ben added the son of hazel the cities which he had taken out of the hand of jehoiaz's father by war three times did joash beat him and recovered the cities of israel oh what could he have done if he just keep striking amen pray the lord let his blessing to the word you may be seated kind of continuing on a theme that we've had the last couple sunday nights and i it must have been a a strange thing to joash to hear the prophet's rebuke he's standing there he thought he did good he thought he was doing everything the prophet asked him to do and he said i'm a good church member if you go back into joash's history it's a tragic story because he turned away from the lord he wasn't meant to have been that way and he was installed in the office by god and in a revival in a move of god and yet at this time he had backslidden in his purpose but yet he was still uh what we would call say a christian today or a believer he he thought he was doing pretty good and he thought he was doing all the prophet ask him to do that's the problem with legalism it's never enough it's never enough that's why you need the inspiration as to even the kids saying it needs to go from your head to your heart it needs to be go beyond something that you figured out and become something that you know become a reality become this become a a real thing in your life that's what we want something real and so it must have been a strange thing to him he must have thought my what what why couldn't i do i can't do anything right why couldn't i have received a approbation why couldn't i have received a word of encouragement from the prophet at this time because i've done what i've been asked to do but yet what he needed to do was to keep striking and to keep doing until he was told to stop now brother branham said the same things happened tonight in the christian church he said we obstruct the arrow of god's deliverance he said it was now i'm going to go somewhere maybe a little bit different than what you think but i want to lay this in as a background here tonight and i want to i want to talk to you about expectations measured by perseverance expectations measured by perseverance so brother madam said this same thing the arrow of god's deliverance has come but we've done the same thing with it he said we've struck the arrow of god's deliverance he said it was god sent past tense the arrow of deliverance to us how many know that tonight god sent the arrow of deliverance to us the arrow of deliverance is the holy spirit that's been sent shot from the bow of god's love he said when the eternity to eternity was pulled together by the court of love god shot the arrow of deliverance into the church on the day of pentecost you're going to preach with me tonight well i feel good tonight i feel like the lord is is doing something among us now he said god shot the arrow of deliverance into the church on the day of pentecost and the church was given in her hands amen he said god shot the arrow of deliverance and the church was given into her hand the arrow of god's deliverance and listen what he says the holy spirit will deliver the church out of any kind of a chaos it could get into glory you get into a chaos he said the holy spirit will deliver a church out of any kind of a chaos it can get oh that's what we need it's the holy spirit right we need to worship him in spirit and in truth now he said that he said to deliver out of any kind of a chaos he could get into but what does it do with it it being the church what do they do with it they picked up the arrow and they struck three times that's a backslidden king god they struck the arrow once and said well we'll build a church that's all right aren't you glad for a nice building we'll teach theology that's all right we need doctrine right we'll teach psychology and have an organization he said that's just about as far as you struck they struck short of many blessings and the church tonight he said hear me the church tonight is still striking short the church has struck short of the baptism of the holy ghost it struck short of deliverance from sin it's struck short but listen they don't have to be you tonight you can keep striking the church struck short he said oh you say i belong to church brother when you got that baptism of the holy ghost it takes that old temper out of you keep striking he said well that's still there brother ben keep striking you haven't you struck short he said it takes that old temper out of you puts you on a dress makes you act like a lady if you are one of course it'll make you quit your smoking you're drinking you're lying stealing and everything brother when you've got the baptism the holy ghost it separates you do we still believe that church amen it separates you delivers you from the things of the world it makes you love god oh now we're going to turn around on the positive side it don't only save you from drinking and smoking and lying but it makes you love god it makes you go to church i think that some people strike short he said it makes you go to church whether the pastors say or not whether your favorite preacher is there or not it makes you go to church it makes you worship him amen it makes you worship him it makes you tell your neighbor about it it makes you live above sin but the modern church has struck short of it and again i'm laying a background here for what we want to say this evening and then i'll quickly be done he said say we got a church we got a good teacher we got theology that is about as much as you know about he said every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line reminds me of the tribes the two tribes that stayed on the other side oh god they stayed there oh it's a good place they could raise cattle but how much more could they have gotten if they went in and you find out that they paid for it later because you find out in the time of jesus that it was a place where there was just a bunch of hog farmers so they actually they actually struck short of the fullness of god let's not stop at the first poll of the second pope let's go on into the third poll where the promises say let's go in there where we can defeat bind the worst is that what we've been preaching where we can bind the worst or anything let's not stop at that knowing the word let's not stop at just understanding god sent a prophet but let's go on in today i mean want to go on in he said that about as much as you know about it but every promise in the book is mine do we believe that tonight we're in the land where the promises lay we're we're under a third the third poll we're living in that time we're not waiting on it expecting something else to come this is that hallelujah he said i hope you're awake this afternoon he said the modern church has struck short of it but every promise in the book is mine god sent the baptism of the holy ghost and put it into the hands of the church so whose hands is it in our hands he said to deliver the arrow of god's deliverance to deliver from sickness from sin from worry you believe god can do that for you from worry he said brother man i don't know what's coming neither do i but the arrow of god's deliverance if you'll keep striking it will deliver you from worry it'll deliver you from trouble from worldliness from everything else he said but we struck short of it now the bible speaks i want to turn a corner here and then kind of try to attempt to bring it back together in psalm 62 and 5 it says my soul wake thou only upon god for my expectation is from him now expectation in the old testament is hope in the new testament that's the word that's used as hope most often in the new testament it speaks of something different than our hope today and we'll explain that but in the old testament it's the hebrew word tikwa which is uh hope expectation it's the object for which one hopes or the basis of which one hopes so it's not a groundless hope or a wish but it's a it's a real expectation based on something it also meant to wait to wait believing in a future possibility oh my and so it refers to the object for which one hopes and this is the word in the old testament jeremiah 29 11. for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in who's doing the expecting all right have you ever thought about that verse someone give you an expected end who's doing the expecting yes sir you are think about it you're doing the expecting god's still god already knows god don't live in time you live in time but you're doing the expecting to give you an end that you expect why because you believe that the word is true you hear me today now so that new testament word for expectation is whole again it's not the same as our modern word for hope which is like well i hope it rains we could all say that i hope it rains but you don't really expect it to right boy you're quiet now you you expect god you you expect there to be rain when there's a cloud right but how much of a cloud do you have to see you see it's a little white clouds but remember amen elijah had something more he saw a cloud the size of a man's hand he said i hear the sound of an abundance of rain that's the way we ought to be with god right he saw just a little bit he said that gives me a hope and expectation it's going to rain so it's not well i hope it rains i wish it rains brother branham speaks of that kind of hope and he said hope what a beautiful thing hope is it's a little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is he said yes she's the greatest enemy faith has he said that's right the greatest thing we face god is hope because a person becomes so hopeful so they leave away from faith he said now hope will agree with the bible hope will say it's true now he's talking again about our modern word hope which is a wishful thinking he said i believe every bit of it i believe that's the word of god i believe that god will keep his promise hope believes all of that but hope then says now i believe that god will heal but look at my condition faith don't look at that faith comes around says i don't care nothing about conditions god said so and it's mine how many say amen to that this afternoon god said so in its mind he said you see faith burly as i once said faith has hair on his chest when it stands up and pulls its big muscles out everything else vanishes away flees away when faith really takes a hold nothing else stands so we have a hope not not in a hope of the modern word that is a wish but we have an expectation for god to keep his word and this is the new testament oh romans 4 18 who against hope believed in hope speaking of abraham he against any right to expect anything good he expected good anyway that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be romans 5 2 which we read last week by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god romans 8 20 for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope and expectation because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body now watch what he says we are saved by hope now that's not this hope brother random is talking about that's just wishful thinking that's not just hope that's not burly but this is expectation we are saved by expectation but hope that is seen as not hope for what a man seeth what if he had hoped for but if we hope that's why i said you're doing the expecting god already sees it you're doing the expecting he said but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it yes sir now brother branham takes expectation so i've been going through some of these older sermons and and kind of putting it together in my mind as far as like here is here is the arrow of god's deliverance which brother branham preached he talks about how they didn't strike long enough and here now is expectation which he preached and he took simeon in the bible in luke 2 25 there was a man in jerusalem his name was simeon the same man was justin devout waiting now there's that hope and expectation waiting for the constellation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ now notice he expected something that had been revealed to him to happen that's when expectation takes hold is when something's been revealed to you it's one thing to hear the preacher preach it it's one thing to sing it it's one thing to say it but when it's revealed to you that it's already done when it's revealed to you that your healing was included in the finished work at calvary when it's revealed to you that's something else entirely when it's revealed you wait with it you wait for it with patience with hope with expectation because it's revealed to you this was revealed to him now brother brown said expectancy that's a great thing to expect something you should get what you expect well we get a whole lot more out of church we'd expect more wouldn't we see our expectations change by the name of the person that's going to be preaching but god's expectations don't change you realize god's expectation don't change based on the man that has been preaching because he already knows the end from the beginning he knows what the service is going to be like but our expectations change you say well you usually get what you expect some people come to the meeting and say well i didn't expect to get anything out of it well they won't but those who expect to get something for the game oh we're expecting something to happen those who expect to get something god will give them their expectations oh god i believe the same god that gave your wife last year at the meeting can give you give your expectation this year what are we expecting remember what i said last week expect big things quit thinking small like you say well i i guess god won't you know it's just too big it's just too much no expect god oh while the presence of god is here when the angel the lord is moving in the services expect him to move expect him to heal expect him to deliver expect your children to come home am i preaching radical is this only for certain churches or is this for us tonight is it only for a big church is it for us i say it's for us tonight i says for us to believe that god's word is true amen that regardless of the circumstance the time of the place he's still jehovah jireh he still provides a lamb where there's no lamb no earthly expectation of a lamb being there but he provided it anyway oh do you believe that tonight church those who expect to get something god will give them their expectations if they're doing it reverently and in the fear of god he said now always to find out something first is to find out whether it's the will of god or not and then if it's the will of god then you're objective to it and your motive in doing it if it's the will of god your objective is right and your motive is right it's got to happen there's just no way to keep it from happening are you with me tonight oh we're going somewhere now brother brown said every man that ever believed in god or heard god's voice expected him to do something have you heard his voice i'm not talking about the literal voice of a man i'm talking about the voice of god through the message of the hour through the scriptures through the holy ghost speaking to your heart the voice of god if you heard it he said now if you can sit right where you are now i wonder what our expectation is tonight i expected to get hot so i took off my jacket see when you expect to do something there's always a corresponding action that's right you expect it to get hot you're going to start preparing for the heat you expect it to be cold you prepare for the cold the same thing's true in the spiritual when you expect something to happen you begin to prepare for that thing to happen he said if you can set right where you are now and so consecrate yourself to god and expect god to do something hear the voice of god whisper down in your heart you don't have to wait for a prayer card tomorrow night this is the time i'm gonna heal you that's all it's settled there'd be nothing else able to shake you from that if you never received the holy spirit oh i wonder if there's someone here that needs the holy spirit tonight that if you never receive the holy spirit and you say lord i sought the holy spirit for years but i just heard a voice tell me i'm gonna get it right tonight that settles it that's it you'll be so expecting and it'll have to happen you need to get yourself in condition to hear his voice yes he said dig those ditches out that's that's expectation how do we know that noah expected it to rain now i'm bringing it around how do we know that he expected it to rain well he built the ark and they come and laughed at him made fun of him it didn't happen when he thought it would and he still built the boat he still picked up the pitch and the tar he's still he's still he still encouraged his family he still preached the gospel he still kept doing it why because he expected it to happen i wonder do we expect a rapture do we expect a body change if we expect it we'll begin to get ready amen how do we know that abraham expected a child how do we know what can we measure his expectation by now think about it he said well i expect god to do great things so how am i going to know that that's true by your perseverance by perseverance in building the boat noah proved to us that he expected god to move by his perseverance in expecting a child abraham persevered through all obstacles oh my for 25 years he persevered through every obstacle what was it for it proved to us what his expectation was that he really believed it now brother brother said perseverance to be persistent now i've tied those three together you go listen to that he said the arrow of god's deliverance thought from a bowl expectations which he preached several times and perseverance which he preached many times as well he said now perseverance to be persistent is to try to make a goal he said trying to you've got your mind set on something and you're persistent in it because you believe it's the thing that you want and you believe you can get it that's two things it's the thing that you want and you believe that you can get it so you expect it to take place and you persevere because of your expectation matthew 15 and 21 says then jesus went thence and departed into the coast of tyre and sidon and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word now look she comes out and she cries out to him thou son of david now she had no hold on him as son of david so when she spoke to him as son of david she's not a jew so to her he could not she could not access the blessings of god under that under that title right son of david she that she was a jew he said my daughter listen we're that's why we can speak the name of jesus yes why we're we're we are the gentiles right we come under the name of jesus and expect under that name that every blessing that he promised will come to us because that's his name to us you understand and now it to others to them he's son of david but to us he's jesus christ our lord jesus christ he's the son of god and son of man now he revealed himself the son of man at the end time now he said have mercy on me oh lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil he answered are not a word his disciples came in beside him saying send her away you can imagine it's like the deacons come and say brother ben we got to deal with this this person shows up at every service and comes down to the altar and just cries and cries and cries she disrupts the service it reminds me of that woman that her baby died in mexico you remember the story her baby died and she was she was just uh she was so perseverant to get where she needed to go where she knew she expected that baby to be raised from the dead i don't know what give her that she maybe never heard the gospel the way we've heard it but there was something inside of her she believed that if she could just get in the presence of a prophet she'd seen the blind eyes healed the night before and so she expected that god could heal blind eyes he can heal my baby he can raise my baby from the dead and so she goes and what does she do she gets in trouble with the deacons she gets in trouble with the ushers and she said he said there she was climbing under him going over the top of them and we'd say well that lady wasn't in order but let me tell you what god wanted to do god wanted to get him just out of it out of order enough to be saved that's what brother brandon said and she had that expectation something was going to happen so what does she do she begins to crawl under and over and everything else and she finally reaches them and he was going to have brother moore go pray for her brother random is going to happen with the mortgages that she won't know the difference just to keep her quiet remember the word that we used was importunity i think the batteries are going dead on this one boo devil doesn't sound better anyway she expected something to happen she expected she expected there to be this needs turned down a little bit she expected there to be a healing so what does she do she goes up there brother man who's going to have to more pray for her and she begins to climb over everything and what happens the very next time here she comes and he sees a vision and god began to meet her expectation why now how do we know she expected it because her perseverance showed us that the expectation she had was right oh i hope you're hearing me today how do you say well i believe god can heal but are you knocking at the door i believe god can save my family are you talking to your family i believe god can give me the holy ghost are you praying for the holy ghost hallelujah expectation measured by perseverance oh god be like a preacher saying well i believe god's going to move in the sunday morning and then not studying at all well i believe god's going to move in the service but you don't prepare yourself for it if you really believe god's going to move you get yourself ready put aside everything else and say lord i believe that you're going to do what you promised you would do and he answered and said i'm not sent and the disciples came and said send her away she cries after us just go lay hands on her and let her go and he answered and said i'm not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel then came she she finally got through the deacons and got through everything else and she came and worshiped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat it's not it's not comely it's not appropriate for me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said that's true lord you talk about saying amen brother dale in the worst circumstance preacher frieza says your race is a bunch of dogs amen lord like i said this morning but the brown said the white man was a real murderer amen lord but even the dogs and i love the way she says it said yet the dogs it's true lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs if you go back in the original that's the little dogs the little puppies even that master has enough mercy on them to eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table oh i know esther is going to make hay with this scripture she found she she we managed to get two dogs because she found a scripture said two are better than one now she's gonna want to expect them to be fed from the table that's a misappropriation of scripture see i caught that spirit the dogs eat the crumbs the little dogs i may be a little dog she said but even the little dogs get some crumbs of mercy i may not be worthy of all the things i'm not worthy but i know this even the littlest part of god's economy think about it he said well i may not be the elect i mean no even the smallest part of god's economy receives blessings from god the rain falls on the just and the unjust don't let that get in your head well i've done some bad things i've done some things that are unworthy i've been a bad person don't you let that keep you from coming to god and persevering because if you expect him to do something for you you can come and persevere until he does amen the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table jesus answered and said it here oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour well no matter if she was a greek but the brandon said she was still persistent she had perseverance he said then somebody might have come up with this old proverb they still have it today the days of miracles has passed there's no such thing but no matter how many hollered at her the days of miracles has passed she still was persistent that might have been for them that believed it when they say the days of miracles passed just say for you they are because you don't believe it but not for her something had already happened inside that let her know that it wasn't past and listen the prophet said until you get past that barrier you'll never do no good you've got to come to a past that barrier god was but isn't now he's still god if he ever was god if he isn't the same god do we believe that tonight if he isn't the same god today he never was god see that's it it's man lost his faith not god lost his power god went back on his promise its man went back on the promise to believe hallelujah she was still persevering if the days of miracles was passed for all of them it wasn't for her see brother ben's mercy mercy's over not for me because i can't make it without his mercy healing's over not for me brother man you can't shout in the church anymore you can't have joy in the holy ghost not for me speak for yourself i still need it maybe you're revelating to the point where you don't need it but i still need to feel the move of god i still need to know what it's like to be drunk in the spirit of god i still need to know what it's like to hear the word and it not be just a dead letter but an inspiration that strikes my heart i still need to know what that's like oh and i want to stand for that for my children and if the lord carries my children's children amen he made me the not be the same god for you but he is for me if he isn't the same god today he never was god see that's it and she was still persevering if days of miracles were passed for all of them it wasn't for her why she struck past that sound barrier she got a hold of something something had struck her so when she worshipped him i love this i said lord help me jesus said but you know it's not me for me to take the children's bread and cast it to you dogs oh my that'd have been a modern pentecostal she had turned that little nose up i said i'll never go to a meeting like that again [Music] oh he said why they don't why would they turn their nose up why would they quit church they don't have the hope that she had that's right she had the hope now what hope is he talking about here the expectation she had the hope she had heard and faith had caught it she had a reason she had a need and she wasn't just wasn't going to turn loose hallelujah now her perseverance showed her expectation it measured it she had a hope that they didn't have king joash in our story he didn't have that kind of hope so he took the arrow of god's deliverance oh god because he looked at the circumstances perhaps and said well the syrians will just keep coming back till they beat us the cancer it'll keep coming around one day it'll get me the the diabetes one day it's going to take my life the blood pressure one of these days i'm going to have a heart attack we're going to have a stroke oh it just happens 100 times out of 100 it's just it's just the nature that's just the way it is but see you need to have hope in the lord david said hope in the lord expect from the lord see king joaz he thought well given the situation well he didn't want to ask for too much because chances are he might be ashamed but see how could you ask too much from a god who knows all things how could you ask too much from a god who believe who sees all things how could you ask too much brother brandon said it's like going into the ocean and taking out a thimbleful out of the ocean and coming out and saying well i better leave the rest there there may not be enough there's always going to be enough oh i hope you see it tonight church there's always going to be enough and the way you what you expect to happen that's what your perseverance will be amen so now here was the here was the the bow of god's love that's what brother brandon said shot the arrow of god's deliverance which is the holy ghost into the church now it's in the hands of the church it was struck once we'll build a church and you see where i was going now i'm almost done you can keep from falling asleep for the next five minutes struck it once built a church struck it twice got the doctrine struck it a third time oh now there's theology creeping in organization what are you gonna do keep striking maybe you've got a situation that seems like it just can't it's never going to change you don't know that i know this if you don't keep asking it's not going to change [Music] if the sour phoenician woman walks away when jesus said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs and she said okay jesus said it i'll just have to go i i find it strange how easily people have accepted well there's no more preachers no more no more holy ghost we just got accepted it's just the age that we live in wait a minute maybe you don't have any because you haven't struck you only struck to build a church you only struck to get a group together you only struck to say i believe a prophet but there's more you struck for the first pole in the second pole but there's a third pole out there there's an opening of the word there's a an endless supply of god's blessings that you don't stop at the third time say we don't even stop at the third pole of brother madam's ministry we keep going because it's an endless word it's an open book it's not closed anymore we keep going into the blessings of god it don't mean we preached something different than brother branham preached we preached the same gospel that paul preached the same gospel that brother brandon preached but it's now it's coming to a place where we know that that we're striking until the rapture amen what do you expect i wonder if our rapture expectation could be measured by our perseverance and getting ready for it oh god let me turn this around a little bit i wonder if our rapture expectations could be measured by how we tell others about it he said go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature these are things i thought about myself does our rapture have we given up on the message you said well i you know everybody's fighting about it you know it just it is what it is they fought in the new testament they fought in the old testament people are people but there's a word here that can change your life oh god do you believe you see but the jesus said from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffered violence now you remember he said on the violent take up by force you remember in the old testament to a certain group you know how you knew how would you measure what your expectation or what your potential could be in the old testament well if you were a jew right if you were a jew you could you could take you were abraham's seed right you could take the gate of your enemy right that you promised that but now you don't have a natural way if you were circumcised there was a natural way to see it but now look at it there's i can't look at you and say you can't show me you don't have a card in your pocket says i'm bride how do we know who the bride was in the vision h how do we know who the bride was in the in all these ages how do we know the kingdom of heaven from the days of john the baptist from the end of the old testament until now it suffers violence amen and the violence the ones who are willing to step out in faith the ones who are willing to walk on the promises of god the ones who are willing to take the land is that you tonight is that me tonight we need to be willing to walk out and take the land the violent take it by force amen how do you know who god's elect is it won't be by natural circumcision it won't be by race it won't be because you have a lot of money but do you take the kingdom of heaven do you take the promises of god that are revealed to you and persevere until you become that promise [Music] that's the challenge tonight i hear you say well brother brother ben i just don't feel like it well of course you don't we're waiting on a change of this vile body let me tell you when you'll feel like it when you get a body change that's when you'll feel like being in church on a sunday afternoon the first time when you get a body change and that's why sometimes as a pastor and sometimes as as ministers we have to kind of push and prod a little bit it's not because we believe you're not alex because we believe we you are you are the elect and because you are the elect you have potentials others don't have and so we tend to prod we tend to push we tend to do that a little bit because we want you to recognize your potential we want you to know that there's an expectation that you should have and that expectation should be measured by your perseverance how else are we going to know whether you believe you're the bride if you believe he said well i'm the bride but you never show up at church oh i'm the restored bride by restored by malachi 4 i've had people tell me i've been restored by malachi foreign the elijah couple restored all things well they'll fight with you about that they believe that what happened to you then you can't go to church you got your feelings hurt everywhere you've ever been you got nobody you got any trust or confidence in you don't believe in the ministry no more you don't believe in anything anymore you're hoping that brother branham comes back so you can finally get a revival but that's not what the bride's waiting on oh my you'll be known by your perseverance you'll be known because you go to church and don't feel like it you'll be known because you do things that are hard to do but you do it anyway why because you're the bride i may be one of the gentiles but i know that if i can storm the gates of heaven there's a there's a victory waiting for me hey man i believe if there's a desire in me there if there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond if i have a healing if there's sickness in my body there's healing somewhere for me let me go till i find it let me let me storm the gates of heaven let me knock at the door until i find it hallelujah oh if this was the last sermon that ever preached to you let me let me tell you this with all of my heart if you storm the gates of heaven there will be an answer if you if you knock it'll be open to you if you ask you shall receive and if you don't you won't there's a little bride waiting you remember the story she'd been told here comes the man from the great armor corporation he come out there she'd been told that he was coming to take her as his bride he wasn't looking for something flashy he was looking for somebody who took the dish water out perseverance i come to pull my sleeves up to give me part to be able to be a part that's the kind of christians we want people are willing to work people don't get their feelings hurt every little thing i'm coming to i'm coming to work i'm coming to believe i'm coming trusting god i'm coming rugged ready to and so she was a worker he looked at her and he said there's character in you i don't find in the others and so he says i'm going to come at a certain time and and here she was what did she do she didn't wait till the last minute but she during that time while she had expectations of him coming she didn't sit down and say well he's got me now i'm the elect he said he would be here so no he wouldn't have come for somebody like that i'm the elect everything's gonna be okay i'll just lay here and wait on to come sit here in the sauna sit here in the spa and just wait on him he comes back and she's not dressed you come back and she's not ready her hair's not combed or you hear me tonight he's not coming for a bride like that but he saw in her a character that would not just look at it and say well he called me so i must be okay but he founded her a character that said if someone that worthy called me who was unworthy then there must be a place i can go to there must be a reality that i can come to that i must be able to do what he wants me to do hey man he told to be ready what does the scripture say the bride has made herself ready oh it would wash in the robes of his righteousness we couldn't make our own righteousness we can't work enough to be righteous but if he gives us the rope the least we could do is put it on let me just let me your perseverance in dressing oh are you hearing me tonight your perseverance and getting dressed for the event tells how much you expect out of the event we live in a day when it doesn't matter and everybody just wear whatever they want to church but your perseverance is getting ready and i'm talking spiritually as the bride is a measure of your expectation i'm going to be there what are we seeing at the beginning i'm going to make it it's already done hallelujah i know it's been simple tonight why don't we just take a moment as the musicians would come remember i want to take a little bit let's worship together i uh you remember the pawn lily and the story brother branham told you know what pawn lily was a seed at one time it got dropped and as it was dropped it it went through the light and down through the darker waters and down through the muck and the mire and finally it reached hard ground and it reached it laid there all winter and it lays there in the cold and the darkness entombed in in clay and mud it lays at the bottom at springtime see the sun that comes down see the sun reaches more than what you can see it reaching the seed may be too low for the sun for the ray of the sun to actually change the appearance of the water but what does it do it warms the temperature of it and it warms the temperature when the water temperature is warm it warms the temperature of the mud until it reaches a certain atmosphere oh my i was talking about that in the office earlier things don't just happen overnight god takes time he's building something good he's doing something good and so when the water when the temperature gets right the lily will begin to come up and then as it begins to come up it'll come it'll push through the muck and the mire and the clay as it comes up it begins to work its way towards the sun it's never even it's never even been on top before but it's working its way to the top and it can have that expectation because expectation is potential because inside of the seed oh god inside there's a dna coated into that seed that says i'm upon lily yes sir or you hear me today i'm upon lily see you can know it with your head but is there something inside the seed you can't keep that down there's a dna coated in to the inside of that seed and it begins to express itself and it pushes through the muck and pushes through the mire pushes through the circumstances of life pushes through the tiredness pushes through the the hardness pushes through all the things of life until it finally it begins to poke its head up and finally it reaches a place where it can become what it's supposed to be what is it a giver oh god it reaches a place where it becomes reverend mr lily where it begins to just give constantly until another seed drops down and the whole process begins all over again you see it's hard-coded in that it there's something inside of you this potential it creates expectation and then we see that the expectation is there by your perseverance or you might fail but your dad don't stop you you might mess up that don't stop you push your way you get up to higher ground or lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table then a higher place than i ever thought i could get to lord lead me onto higher ground do we know that song i don't know if we know that or not but you know we we're lifting up to something different we're going to be something more than what we are we're all still human but you're pressing why are you pressing what did he tell the bride are you expecting a rapture what did they tell him the ones who were already there they said keep pressing on pressing up through the mud through the mire through the clay until i reach a place i'm on higher ground i'm pressing on [Music] the upward way can we sing it tonight let's stand together heights i'm gaining it may not look like much but i'm gaining a place i haven't been to before oh yes still praying yes [Music] let's sing it now oh lord lift me up oh and let me stand and thank you lord my faith on him open [Music] lord plant [Music] the utmost high that one's fine and catch a dream a gleam amen of glory bride thank you lord oh but still i'll pray i'm not gonna quit i'm not giving up till heaven i found lord lead me on to higher ground amen lord lift me up [Music] do you believe it today just worship him now faith on him if you need prayer if you need prayer the altar is open tonight i'll be glad to pray with you [Music] higher [Music] my heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise fears dismayed though some may dwell where these abound my prayer mine is a higher ground lord lift me up and let me stand [Music] i want to stand the utmost high and catch a gleam of glory bright but still i pray to heaven i found lord lead me on to higher ground lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on hand [Music] [Music] lord plant my feet on high sing that course one more time lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table land a higher plane [Music] ain't got good [Music] to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are we are to thank him loving praise him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow oh ain't got good [Music] to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are we are to thank him love embrace him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow one more time oh ain't got good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are we ought to thank him loving praise him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow amen give the lord a hang type of praise [Applause] enjoy that service this evening amen just be praying for them as they travel just be praying god will bless them and protect them and then be just i remember those requests that were turned in and mentioned god would just touch them as well let's sing that song just as we go i'm a soldier in the army of the lord amen amen let's just sing this just as we go we'll sing it one time through and then you're free to go that's in the key of g is what it says too high go down one i'd rather sing low than high i must in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in this army i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army of one more time oh i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in this army i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army you're free to go oh if i die i'll die a fight in the army of the lord if i die i'll die to fight in this army if i die i'll die a fight in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army of lord oh i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in this army i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier [Music]
