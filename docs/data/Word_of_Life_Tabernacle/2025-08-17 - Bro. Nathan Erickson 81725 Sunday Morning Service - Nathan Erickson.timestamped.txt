[41:17] of my soul.

[42:12] heart of my soul.

[42:18] Oh bread of heaven,
[42:23] oh won't you feed me till
[42:27] I want no
[42:31] more.
[42:33] Here's my cup.
[42:36] Fill it up and make
[42:41] me whole.
[42:44] they continue to play as we uh going to
[42:46] ask brother Nathan Ericson to come in
[42:48] just a moment and speak to you. We're
[42:50] excited to have him this morning with
[42:52] us. And I wanted to add my thanks to
[42:55] each one that helped. I know some of you
[42:58] are not feeling um uh completely up to
[43:01] par. There's been some kind of cold
[43:03] going around, some are cold, but I
[43:05] appreciate you stepping up and and
[43:07] helping in every way. And we're so
[43:09] thankful. I think it's worth it to do it
[43:11] for these young people. And so we're so
[43:13] thankful for all of you, especially I
[43:16] want to mention Sister Vicki and brother
[43:18] Danny. Thank you for all that you do.
[43:20] And Sister Vicki uh did all the
[43:22] decorating over there, most of it. And
[43:24] Sister Joanna helped her. And then
[43:26] brother Joel and Sister Virginia and for
[43:29] all the work that they did. I know they
[43:31] wear themselves out for the folks here.
[43:33] And so we're thankful for them. Uh
[43:35] Brother Nathan Ericson is with us. He
[43:37] did a wonderful job last night at the
[43:39] banquet. We really enjoyed that. And I
[43:41] believe that that's all right. Go ahead.
[43:43] I believe the word was very very clear
[43:45] to us last night.
[43:47] There there's something in our heart
[43:49] that only Christ, a place that only
[43:51] Christ can fill. And I trust that was a
[43:53] blessing to you young people. But I uh
[43:56] think a lot of brother Nathan, his his
[43:58] attitude towards ministry and the way
[44:00] that he treats people. And we've had a
[44:03] chance to fellowship with him up at the
[44:04] youth camp that they have. And he just
[44:06] got done doing that. So, I know brother
[44:08] Nathan's a little tired and body as
[44:11] well. Let's just give the word our
[44:12] utmost attention this morning. And I
[44:15] believe God's got something for me. He's
[44:16] got something for you. Do you believe
[44:17] that he can speak directly to you? Take
[44:20] the preacher off of his notes and speak
[44:22] directly to you this morning. Amen. God
[44:25] bless you. As brother Nathan comes,
[44:26] let's sing this again. Fill my cup, fill
[44:31] it up,
[44:33] and make me whole. Sing it with all your
[44:38] heart now. Oh, fill my heart.
[44:46] Oh, I lifted.
[44:48] [Music]
[44:54] Come and quench
[44:59] this thirsting
[45:01] of my soul.
[45:05] Oh
[45:08] bread of heaven,
[45:13] feed me till I want
[45:19] no
[45:20] more.
[45:23] Here's my cup.
[45:26] Fill it up and make me whole.
[45:35] Amen. That's certainly our desire this
[45:37] morning. Amen. Uh just looking to him to
[45:41] provide what we have need of today. Just
[45:43] want to say God bless you. Really
[45:45] honored to be here. My first time uh
[45:47] speaking to you all and and uh just uh
[45:50] just really feel honored uh appreciate
[45:53] the friendship that uh we've been able
[45:55] to build with brother Ben and uh and his
[45:58] family and and the saints here over the
[46:00] past few years. And uh just just really
[46:03] appreciate brother Ben, his direction,
[46:05] his wisdom, his stability. And I know
[46:08] you're all blessed here. And I uh we
[46:10] share if the Lord Terry's looking
[46:12] looking forward to a great future for
[46:14] the church here and these families. And
[46:16] boy, it did my heart good to sit back
[46:18] there and and uh and watch on the screen
[46:20] there is what a what a great group of
[46:23] young people you've got here. What a
[46:25] just a what a treasure that is. Amen. Uh
[46:28] just uh you know the future looks bright
[46:30] as the Lord just leads us along. Um I
[46:34] appreciate what the Lord is doing
[46:35] amongst young people. This message uh
[46:38] it's a it's a burden. It's a personal
[46:39] burden of mine to just see uh that they
[46:42] prosper, that they're ministered to.
[46:44] Appreciate Brother Ben this year for
[46:45] being a part of our youth camp, speaking
[46:47] to some of our uh we our our one of our
[46:50] older groups there. We have a special
[46:52] session just for them. Brother Ben was a
[46:54] real blessing with his ministry to that.
[46:56] So, uh, want to say just God bless you
[46:59] and just greet you. We won't take too
[47:01] long. In preliminaries, we'll go right
[47:03] to the word of God. If you want to turn
[47:04] to Matthew chapter 26 and
[47:07] amen, thank you musicians and thank you
[47:10] all for you're welcome. Let me be a part
[47:13] of your banquet.
[47:14] And I'll just add my thanks to the pile
[47:17] for everybody that labored and worked.
[47:19] What a what a what a great production
[47:21] that you put on and and uh what a nice
[47:25] time that we had. And I want to greet
[47:27] you from home from brother Wayne Lawson,
[47:29] our pastor, all the saints back at True
[47:31] Word Tabernacle.
[47:33] Want to turn to Matthew chapter 6. Just
[47:35] read verses 26 to 29 there. Familiar
[47:39] parable.
[47:42] Give me a moment. I'll catch up to you.
[47:52] And uh
[47:54] just ask the Lord to help us this
[47:55] morning. I'd like to consider the lily.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Consider the lily. Just some simple
[48:00] things Lord has had in my heart here
[48:02] recently. Jesus says, "Behold the fowls
[48:05] of the air, for they sow not, neither do
[48:08] they reap, nor gather into barns, and
[48:11] yet your heavenly Father feedth them.
[48:14] Are you not much better than they? And
[48:17] which of you by taking thought can add
[48:20] one cubit unto his stature?
[48:24] Why take ye thought for raignment?
[48:26] Consider the liies of the field, how
[48:28] they grow. They toil not, neither do
[48:31] they spin. And yet I say unto you that
[48:34] even Solomon in all his glory was not a
[48:36] raid like one of these. And what a
[48:39] beautiful what a beautiful parable
[48:40] there. Let's just go to him in a word of
[48:42] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we
[48:45] would consider the lily today, Father,
[48:48] Lord, one of your original seed, I pray,
[48:51] Father, that you would just come and
[48:53] expound upon these words, Lord.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, let us think about the seed that's
[48:58] planted in us, Lord, by your elective
[49:00] love, Father, to predestinate your
[49:03] children, Lord. And I pray, Father, that
[49:05] Lord, as we would look at these simple
[49:06] things, we'd see the Lord, we'd see the
[49:09] depth within them, Lord, the meaning,
[49:11] Lord, just the profound truth, Lord,
[49:14] that you have hidden in your creation,
[49:16] Lord. And Lord, as a man, we have no
[49:18] ability to help your people, Lord, or
[49:20] surely we would, Lord, we're just
[49:22] dependent today on your Holy Spirit. I
[49:25] pray Lord this would not just be another
[49:27] service father but Lord especially
[49:29] thinking of the labor Lord and the
[49:30] burden that has gone into this weekend
[49:32] Lord to bless these young people Father
[49:34] and to Lord to further your kingdom. I
[49:36] just pray Lord you'd reward what's been
[49:38] poured out. I pray your Holy Spirit
[49:40] would take us in your hands Lord and use
[49:42] each one as your instrument father that
[49:44] we would just be in harmony with your
[49:45] symphony Father. We give you the
[49:47] preeminence, Lord. We ask that you would
[49:49] just have your way, Lord. Would you say
[49:51] what you have in mind to say today,
[49:53] Lord, and may we may we not be bound by
[49:55] our programs or our preconceptions, but
[49:57] may you just take us, Lord, and take
[49:59] this service in your control. And I pray
[50:01] you just do something of eternal value,
[50:03] Lord, that would encourage and uplift
[50:05] and strengthen your children. I pray we
[50:08] dedicate ourselves to you, Lord. We
[50:09] dedicate this time in Jesus Christ's
[50:12] name. Amen. God bless you as you're
[50:14] seated today.
[50:16] And just uh if you're not familiar with
[50:19] uh with uh with my preaching, my my
[50:22] ministry, I'm just kind of one of those
[50:24] guys. I need to stumble around a little
[50:25] bit and just kind of chip away at this
[50:28] thought until we just find that channel
[50:29] and then we'll we'll go. Okay. So, you
[50:32] just bear with me here. But I I want I I
[50:35] I'm struck by this thought about
[50:36] considering the lily. And uh you know,
[50:39] it's the way with the word of God that
[50:41] the God hides himself. Brother Bram
[50:43] said, "In simplicity, we find out that
[50:45] even though God God uh works in simple
[50:48] things, there's hidden meaning in that
[50:50] simplicity." And just because God is
[50:53] simple in his ways, doesn't mean it's
[50:54] not profound. It doesn't mean it's not
[50:56] deep. It doesn't mean it's not worthy of
[50:58] meditation and and studying things. And
[51:01] so, just to kind of set the tone here in
[51:03] that message, God hiding himself,
[51:05] Brother Brandham said this, and I I just
[51:06] like it. He said, 'I'd say that a man a
[51:09] man could sit down and look at a bunch
[51:11] of flowers, a bouquet, and he could
[51:14] study that for 30 minutes sincerely with
[51:16] all of his heart. Brother Bram said, and
[51:18] he'd know more about God than than he'd
[51:21] know if he had all the degrees that a
[51:23] Bible school could give him, for God
[51:25] reveals himself in the flower. I I I
[51:28] think it'd be worthy of our time and
[51:29] today to consider the lily just a little
[51:32] while. And brother Brandon preached on
[51:33] this lily. He preached on Reverend Mr.
[51:35] Lily, you know, and uh and how that uh
[51:38] the the story of this flower is the it's
[51:40] the story of an overcomer. Amen. It's a
[51:42] it's a type of the Christian life. It's
[51:44] a type of our uh of our journey in life.
[51:47] It's it's a it's not an overnight
[51:49] process, but it's a but but but this
[51:52] Christian life is is represented this
[51:54] lily. It starts as a seed and it ends up
[51:56] as a blossom. Amen. There's a there's a
[51:58] process of growth. There's a
[52:00] development. There's a journey. And and
[52:02] that's that's really where you have to
[52:03] start. You know, when you if you go down
[52:05] to uh there's a family in our church,
[52:07] they have a a big greenhouse and and uh
[52:10] we were there at opening day this spring
[52:12] and you you you look at all the
[52:14] beautiful flowers that are there and and
[52:16] uh and just, you know, the beauty of
[52:18] God's creation and and uh and and and
[52:20] you look at that flower and you might
[52:22] say to yourself, "Well, you know, how
[52:23] could I obtain that? How could I have
[52:25] something like that at my home in my
[52:27] yard or in my flower garden?" And you
[52:29] know, cuz you're looking at a flower in
[52:31] all of its glory and it's got a color,
[52:32] it's got a fragrance, it's got a an
[52:35] expression, and you look at that and you
[52:36] say, "Well, how could I get one?" Well,
[52:38] you you you can't just manifest one into
[52:40] being. And you know, you got to start
[52:43] with a seed. There's a process to it
[52:45] that it starts with a seed. It has to
[52:46] come into an atmosphere. There has to be
[52:48] a quickening. And we know all these
[52:49] things are part of the journey. It's the
[52:51] same way with a Christian life. You
[52:53] know, for a young person, you look at
[52:54] somebody that you admire. You look at a
[52:56] pastor or a parent or a hero in your
[52:58] life spiritually and you you look at
[53:00] their life and their life is giving out
[53:02] something. There's a virtue, there's a
[53:04] fragrance, there's an atmosphere,
[53:06] there's there's a character that they
[53:07] carry. And you look at that, we look at
[53:09] other Christians and we we see things
[53:11] that that the Lord has done and we look
[53:13] at that, we say, "Well, how can I attain
[53:16] that? How can that be how could I make
[53:18] that part of of my life?" And, you know,
[53:20] how how could I be an attainer of that?
[53:22] Well, it's the same exact process,
[53:24] brother, sister. You got to start with a
[53:26] seed. Nothing, you know, nothing nothing
[53:28] in the kingdom of God really happens
[53:29] overnight like that. Uh not not when it
[53:32] comes to the Christian life, when it
[53:33] comes to character, when it comes to
[53:35] that expression, when it comes to
[53:37] expressing the attributes of God, it
[53:39] starts with a seed of predestination.
[53:42] And that's why we preach so much on the
[53:43] quickening power. You know, I think
[53:45] people get in their mind sometimes that
[53:47] that an evangelist will stand in the
[53:48] pulpit and and hammer on the moving of
[53:50] the spirit and the quickening power and
[53:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and things
[53:54] like that just to try to get people, you
[53:56] know, just to just try to get the people
[53:58] worked up noisy enough where he feels
[53:59] like he did some preaching. But there's
[54:01] a lot more to it than that, brother,
[54:02] sister. There's a there's something very
[54:04] important uh uh uh there's a very
[54:06] important uh thing uh uh uh that's at
[54:09] the root of that because look without
[54:11] the quickening power it don't matter
[54:12] what a perfect seed that you have it'll
[54:14] never become what it was meant to be.
[54:17] It's the it's the quickening power that
[54:19] brings the potential of our father out
[54:21] of us. It's a quickening power that
[54:23] takes a seed and and unlocks this
[54:25] process of growing. Otherwise, it'll lay
[54:27] dormant for years and years and years.
[54:29] Brother Bram said it was quickening
[54:31] power. You know, we like to talk a lot
[54:32] about the things that we know. We talk
[54:34] about mysteries. We talk about the seven
[54:36] seals and the coming of the Lord. But
[54:37] brother Bram said, "Quickening power
[54:39] opened those seven seals." And
[54:41] quickening power lets us see his coming.
[54:43] It was quickening power that gave
[54:44] discernment. Quickening power did all of
[54:46] these things, Brother Bram said. And so,
[54:48] you know, that's why we need that
[54:50] quickening power in our church. Our
[54:52] young people need it. Our old people
[54:53] need it. Everybody that's a seed of God
[54:55] is reliant on that quickening power that
[54:57] we may come into the image of what God
[54:59] wants us to be. That is what brings
[55:01] growth out of the seed. That's what
[55:03] takes us up higher. That's what, you
[55:05] know, God didn't send the Holy Ghost to
[55:07] the church just to be a tingle up and
[55:08] down our spine. That's what brings the
[55:10] growth. That's what brings the power.
[55:12] That's what brings all of these things.
[55:13] Amen. Amen. And so, a seed, we find out
[55:16] a seed is not, you know, we're starting
[55:18] just preaching on this lily, this this
[55:20] lily life of a Christian. And that's
[55:22] where we got to start is at the
[55:23] beginning. And it's a seed. Now, a seed
[55:25] is not born a seed is not born when it
[55:27] falls from the branch of its parentage.
[55:29] when a, you know, when a when an acorn
[55:31] falls off an oak tree, that's not a
[55:32] birth, right? That's not a birth. And
[55:34] and and no, no more is it a is the new
[55:37] birth is not just being born and raised
[55:39] in a church. It's not just, you know,
[55:40] being raised in a certain lifestyle and
[55:42] being taught certain things and
[55:44] believing God sent a prophet and all
[55:46] those things are wonderful, but they
[55:47] don't constitute a birth because a seed
[55:49] can fall from the branch that of its
[55:51] parent, but it'll it'll lay there and
[55:53] sometimes it'll lay there for many many
[55:55] years. you know that that it'll lay
[55:57] there dormant and just nothing going on
[55:59] and Amen. But there has to come a
[56:01] quickening. There has to come an
[56:02] experience. There has to come a a moment
[56:05] where where where that seed just comes
[56:06] into the right atmosphere and appointed
[56:08] time and an appointed place where it
[56:10] quickens to life. It's not always a
[56:12] great big explosion, but something
[56:14] happens and it's a from that time
[56:16] moment. Amen. Where it it brings a life
[56:19] uh it brings something to life in a sea.
[56:21] That's that's what we want for all of
[56:23] our children. Sure, we want to raise
[56:24] them right. Sure, we want to teach them.
[56:26] Amen. Sure. Sure, we want to we want to
[56:28] keep them in a good church, in a good
[56:30] community where they can have support
[56:31] and they can have resources. But but
[56:33] above all that, we don't want them to
[56:35] lay dormant all their life. But we want
[56:37] to have enough we want to have enough
[56:38] God in the church, enough of an
[56:40] atmosphere, amen, where children can be
[56:42] born. Amen. That's a real mature plant.
[56:45] You know, a mature plan is not one that
[56:47] uh you know, we we kind of think uh uh
[56:49] we kind of think, well, as as message
[56:51] believers, we've come to where we know
[56:53] so much and where we have so much
[56:55] understanding. And now, Brother Joe,
[56:56] we're we're a mature church. We're we're
[56:58] mature. And so, we don't need, you know,
[57:01] we don't need the moving the spirit like
[57:02] we used to have, and we don't need all
[57:04] those, you know, we don't need the
[57:05] supernatural, and we don't need all
[57:07] those things because now now we have
[57:08] something that we know and now we're a
[57:10] mature church. But I would just submit
[57:12] to you uh today that that uh that a
[57:14] mature plant is not a plant which is
[57:17] dried up, cut down, laid aside uh can no
[57:20] longer bring forth fruit. It's just dry.
[57:22] It's cracked. It's a it's got no life in
[57:24] it. A mature tree. Amen. A mature plant,
[57:27] a bride tree is a tree that has come to
[57:30] such a maturity that it's able to
[57:32] reproduce the life that originally went
[57:34] into the ground. And that's the kind of
[57:36] maturity I'm looking for in the bride of
[57:38] Jesus Christ. That's why we're laying
[57:39] under the light of this word is to bring
[57:41] us, amen, to a place where we're able to
[57:44] reproduce new life. And Amen. I believe
[57:46] we should be a child birthing church. I
[57:48] believe the bride, amen, should have
[57:50] quickening power. Amen. Not to just get
[57:52] everybody excited to bring forth life
[57:55] and Amen. bring forth new children. That
[57:57] our young people would have an
[57:58] opportunity to know a real God and the
[58:00] real baptism of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[58:03] That's that's that's what a real birth
[58:05] is when it's quickened to life.
[58:06] Everything on the outside we were
[58:08] dealing with a little bit last night.
[58:09] Everything on the outside is just the
[58:11] it's the outward trappings of of a
[58:13] religion. Brother Bram said that's a
[58:15] husk. Amen. It's a husk. You know, we
[58:17] thank God for a nice church building,
[58:19] but that's a husk. We thank God for a
[58:20] nice community, but that's a husk. We
[58:22] thank God for gifts and we thank God for
[58:24] ministries, but without what Brother
[58:26] Bram said, the lifeline in the framework
[58:28] of the church, it's dead. Amen. And uh
[58:31] and so there's got to be Amen. So, so a
[58:34] maturity, a church of maturity is a
[58:36] church that can bring forth new life.
[58:38] Amen. Amen. Uh can reproduce itself and
[58:41] Amen. That's why we want to have an
[58:43] atmosphere for birth. Amen. Because
[58:46] every Christian life is a seed and that
[58:48] seed never has a chance until it's
[58:50] quickened. Amen. Amen. Uh as brother
[58:52] Bram said, he said, "Are we really
[58:54] getting people to Christ or are we just
[58:56] getting them to church?" But we must get
[58:58] them to Christ where there's quickening
[59:00] power.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So moving on from there, in the
[59:03] rising of the sun, brother Bram would
[59:04] say this. He said, "Is there is there
[59:06] one in here?" This is his challenge to
[59:07] his own church. This is what I would
[59:09] preach in my church and and what we in
[59:11] any church. Is there somebody here who
[59:13] doesn't have this quickening power in
[59:15] you? The sun has shine across. He said,
[59:17] "Maybe you've said in this tabernacle,
[59:19] you've listen to tapes, but the spirit
[59:22] has never quickened you till you could
[59:23] follow the word of God." Brother Bram
[59:25] said, "That's a dangerous thing. What if
[59:27] you would be a dead seed with no life in
[59:29] you?" He said, "But there's something in
[59:31] you." Watch this. Now, here's where we
[59:33] we want to take off on this right here.
[59:35] But there's something in you that tells
[59:37] you, "I want to rise." Amen. A little
[59:40] voice in you says, "I want to rise this
[59:42] morning. I want to rise from the state
[59:44] that I'm in. I don't want to just be a
[59:46] dead seed and be left to dirt and
[59:48] driftwood. I want to rise." Amen. Now,
[59:51] we got people in the house of God today
[59:53] that are at all different stages of
[59:54] life. You're at all different levels of
[59:56] the Christian journey. You might be in a
[59:58] mess. You might be having a hard time.
[1:00:00] You may be struggling with things. And
[1:00:02] Amen. And we could we could talk about
[1:00:03] all of that. But let's focus on this
[1:00:05] today. Amen. No matter where you're at,
[1:00:07] no matter what you're pushing through in
[1:00:09] your life, if you've got that little
[1:00:10] voice on the inside of you, something
[1:00:12] inside that's crying out saying, "I want
[1:00:14] to rise. I don't want to stay where I'm
[1:00:16] at. I don't want to I don't want to
[1:00:18] become stagnant. There's a there's a
[1:00:20] life. There's a voice. There's a there's
[1:00:22] a law inside of me that's pushing and
[1:00:24] saying, I want to get somewhere higher
[1:00:26] than where I am right now." Amen,
[1:00:28] brother. If you got that in, sister,
[1:00:30] that's power. Now, that's power. That's
[1:00:33] the kind of power I want to preach on
[1:00:34] today. Amen. It's power. Now, there's
[1:00:37] all kinds of power in the word of God.
[1:00:38] You know, the Christian church, they got
[1:00:40] power to heal. They got power to
[1:00:42] deliver. We got power to bind and power
[1:00:44] to loose and all those things. But, but
[1:00:46] this kind of power, I might be bold
[1:00:47] enough to say, is the most important
[1:00:50] kind of power that a that's in a
[1:00:52] Christian, amen, is called power to
[1:00:54] become. That's what that little voice
[1:00:56] is. It's the voice of a seed. And if
[1:00:59] it's a seed, it's got power in it. Even
[1:01:01] if it looks humble, even if it's in a
[1:01:03] dirty place, even if it's pushing
[1:01:05] through earthly things, it there's a
[1:01:07] power behind that little still small
[1:01:10] voice. It's power to become. Power to
[1:01:13] become something more tomorrow than you
[1:01:16] are today. Power to become more than you
[1:01:18] ever imagined you could be. Power to
[1:01:20] experience things in the Lord that you
[1:01:22] never thought was possible. power to
[1:01:24] reach a potential, amen, that you never
[1:01:26] expected. Oh my, amen. That's the kind
[1:01:28] of power that's in a Christian. Power to
[1:01:30] become, Amen, a son of God. That's
[1:01:33] there's something in you that wants to
[1:01:34] rise. That's called the law of a seed.
[1:01:37] And what I want to preach to you today,
[1:01:38] Amen. If that little voice is testifying
[1:01:41] of something in you, it's a law. A law
[1:01:43] of life, Brother Brandon would call it.
[1:01:45] Because a seed is the encapsulation of a
[1:01:48] law. Amen. How many know that there was
[1:01:50] a law that God set into place in the
[1:01:52] book of Genesis? Remember what it was?
[1:01:54] He said, "Let every seed bring forth of
[1:01:57] its own kind." Now, now that's a law.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a law. It was something God
[1:02:02] put into place. He set it into motion
[1:02:04] and it cannot be broken because it's a
[1:02:06] law of God. Not a not a most of the
[1:02:08] time. Ever since God said, "Let every
[1:02:10] seed bring forth of its own kind." Uh,
[1:02:13] you ready for some deep teaching this
[1:02:14] morning?
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; A cat has never had puppies. Right?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever seen it?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; And a and a and a dog has never had
[1:02:22] kittens.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Never happened one time because God made
[1:02:25] a law and he set it in motion. Amen.
[1:02:28] That if it's cat life, it's got to bring
[1:02:29] forth cat cat children. And a dog life
[1:02:32] has got to bring forth dog children.
[1:02:34] That's a law. That's not a most of the
[1:02:36] time or not a hope. It's every time.
[1:02:38] Amen. And so there's a law that's in a
[1:02:40] seed. Well, then that that's room for
[1:02:42] shouting, brother, sister. Amen. Because
[1:02:44] if God would put a seed of his own life
[1:02:46] in the heart of a Christian, a seed of
[1:02:48] predestination, amen, then it's not a
[1:02:50] hope we make it anymore. It's not a hope
[1:02:53] we get it figured out or a hope we get
[1:02:55] there. Amen. There's a law that's in a
[1:02:57] seed. Amen. That when he plants it in a
[1:02:59] Christian, Amen. God's he God's not
[1:03:01] worried about what's going to come out
[1:03:02] of that seed. The only question is if
[1:03:04] it's ever been quickened. Brother Ram
[1:03:06] said it don't matter if you're a a
[1:03:08] pretty seed, a talented seed, what kind
[1:03:10] of a seed that you The only question of
[1:03:12] a seed is whether it's been quickened to
[1:03:14] life. But you ever quicken a seed to
[1:03:16] life. Amen. It will prove what's in it
[1:03:19] and it'll do that all by itself. Oh my.
[1:03:22] Let's uh let's go. See, you can spend a
[1:03:25] long time with a seed. You can study it.
[1:03:27] It's deep. You know, a law of a seed is
[1:03:30] simple, but it's deep. It's profound.
[1:03:32] There's a lot that you can understand
[1:03:34] and there's a lot of study that goes
[1:03:35] into a seed. You know, you look at
[1:03:37] agriculture today, how scientific it's
[1:03:39] become and they can they can take a seed
[1:03:41] into a laboratory. They can understand
[1:03:42] the genetics of it. They can understand
[1:03:44] they understand the nutrition and
[1:03:46] everything that's involved perfectly.
[1:03:48] They can they can study the chemistry of
[1:03:50] the soil. They can mess with the, you
[1:03:52] know, the atmosphere. They can they can
[1:03:53] build green houses and they can change
[1:03:55] the pressure and the temperature and
[1:03:56] they can do all those kind of things,
[1:03:58] you know, because it's become so man has
[1:04:00] become so advanced in his study of the
[1:04:02] seed. But underneath all of that study
[1:04:05] and underneath all of that men's
[1:04:06] learning, amen, there's a law of God in
[1:04:08] effect. So when a man goes out and
[1:04:10] plants a corn field, Amen. Amen. All he
[1:04:13] can do, Amen. at the end of the day, he
[1:04:15] can fertilize it. He can plow it just
[1:04:17] right. He can set everything just right.
[1:04:18] But at the end of the day, he's got to
[1:04:20] put a seed in the ground and submit
[1:04:22] himself to God's law and let God's law
[1:04:24] take place. Because God's laws, amen,
[1:04:27] are fundamental. They are true. They are
[1:04:29] firm. Amen. And so, it's only the life
[1:04:31] that's in a seed that can make him him
[1:04:33] blossom. You see, a a farmer, he can
[1:04:36] plant a seed, but he can't go out the
[1:04:38] next day and dig up that seed and try to
[1:04:40] help it help it just help pry it open
[1:04:43] and try to pull a little sprout out of
[1:04:44] it. You can't help it. Amen. It's God's
[1:04:47] law. It's God's process. But the
[1:04:49] beautiful thing about a seed is if you
[1:04:50] plant a a field of corn, you don't have
[1:04:53] to worry about getting soybeans and you
[1:04:55] don't have to worry about getting
[1:04:56] potatoes because the law, there's a law
[1:04:58] in the seed that you planted. Amen. That
[1:05:01] given time and atmosphere, it will
[1:05:03] become exactly what it promised to be.
[1:05:06] Let's listen to brother Brandham teach
[1:05:07] it. God's power to transform. I a little
[1:05:10] while ago, I was just I was thinking I
[1:05:12] wanted to get a better handle on this
[1:05:13] transforming power. Brother Brandham
[1:05:15] preached a whole message, right, on
[1:05:17] God's power to transform. And and I I
[1:05:19] just wanted to understand that that that
[1:05:21] transformation, that power. I began to
[1:05:23] study this message. You know what? He he
[1:05:25] just talks about a seed. Amen. But
[1:05:27] there's a mystery in this, brother,
[1:05:29] sister. Listen as the prophet would say.
[1:05:31] He said, "When he put the seed in the
[1:05:32] earth, the seed can only come forth with
[1:05:35] the power of life in it." I like that.
[1:05:38] The power of life with within it to
[1:05:40] transform it from a seed to a plant or
[1:05:43] whatever it was. It's his transforming
[1:05:46] power. He said, "Now, God put the seed
[1:05:48] in there with potentials that it would
[1:05:51] be what he said it would be." And as
[1:05:54] long as it stayed in its right category,
[1:05:57] it would be just exactly what God said
[1:05:59] it would be, it had to be that way
[1:06:01] because he made it that way. And God
[1:06:03] made a channel that anything that stays
[1:06:06] in his channel, Amen, in his line of
[1:06:09] word, listen, it will have to bring
[1:06:11] forth exactly like his word said it
[1:06:15] would do. Amen. Brother Brand spoke of
[1:06:17] Genesis. He said, "Then God said, it's
[1:06:19] all good. I'll just rest." You see, God
[1:06:23] is resting. Amen. God is not worried
[1:06:25] about what'll become of his seed. Amen.
[1:06:28] He's resting on it. He he said because
[1:06:30] each one of those seeds listen now each
[1:06:33] one of those seeds how many believe
[1:06:34] you're a seed of God by predestination.
[1:06:36] Then brother Bram said each one of those
[1:06:39] seeds has power in itself to transform
[1:06:43] itself into the species that I desire it
[1:06:46] to be. That's what it must be because I
[1:06:50] have given every seed transforming
[1:06:53] power. Amen. to make of itself in its
[1:06:56] potentials to make of itself exactly
[1:06:59] what I want it to be. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:02] You say, "Brother Nathan, I need power
[1:07:04] this morning. I need transforming power.
[1:07:06] I've got situations in my life and I
[1:07:08] need them. I need a transformation. I
[1:07:10] need my body transformed. I need my I
[1:07:13] need my mind transformed. I need my
[1:07:15] attitude transformed." Listen, brother.
[1:07:17] Amen. God gave you transforming power
[1:07:19] when he put a seed of life on the inside
[1:07:22] of you. Amen. And see, God put a seed in
[1:07:24] his children that he could sit back and
[1:07:26] rest knowing that the law of life that's
[1:07:28] in that seed has got all the power in it
[1:07:31] that it needs, amen, to become what he
[1:07:33] wanted it to be. It doesn't matter what
[1:07:35] you're up against. It doesn't matter
[1:07:37] what the question is. It does not matter
[1:07:39] the situation. The power that we need,
[1:07:41] brother, is not in heaven somewhere, but
[1:07:44] the power is in you. It's in that seed.
[1:07:47] Amen. God doesn't gain confidence in his
[1:07:49] children the first time they come to an
[1:07:51] altar. He didn't gain confidence in you
[1:07:53] the first time you knelt down to pray or
[1:07:55] when a preacher put his hand on you or
[1:07:57] spoke a word. That's not when God gained
[1:07:59] his confidence. God has had confidence
[1:08:01] in his children ever since he put a seed
[1:08:04] in them be by predestination before the
[1:08:06] foundation of the world. God trusts the
[1:08:09] seed. That means you can trust the seed.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, amen. Because the Bible
[1:08:14] says, "As many as received him, to them
[1:08:17] gave he power to become the sons of
[1:08:20] God."
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, once you find out what
[1:08:24] kind of a seed of is in you, it takes a
[1:08:26] lot of the worry out of our Christian
[1:08:28] journey.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; It takes a lot of the fear out of it.
[1:08:31] Amen. When you realize the power that is
[1:08:33] in that humble little seed and see God,
[1:08:37] that's God's power. That's God's law.
[1:08:39] And God's very concerned with preserving
[1:08:40] this law.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You look at you look at how the
[1:08:43] word focuses on that seed. Brother
[1:08:45] Brandham preached Amen. He brother
[1:08:46] Brandham would preach on it. The spoken
[1:08:48] word is the original seed. Many of his
[1:08:51] of his messages especially toward the
[1:08:52] end would deal with this law. They would
[1:08:54] deal with this this profound Amen.
[1:08:57] truth. Amen. That a seed of God cannot
[1:08:59] help but become what God wanted it to
[1:09:02] be. Listen, I'll just put it simply like
[1:09:04] this. When God plants a seed, God
[1:09:06] expects a blossom.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said when he gave you the Holy
[1:09:09] Ghost, what did he do? He gave you
[1:09:11] everything you have need of for life's
[1:09:13] journey. Amen. He didn't he didn't ask
[1:09:15] you to become an oak tree all by
[1:09:17] yourself, but he gave you an acorn of
[1:09:20] faith and potential. And he put but he
[1:09:22] put a law in what he put in in what he
[1:09:24] gave you. Amen. That if you just take
[1:09:26] your hands off of it and let God's law
[1:09:28] work, it will become what he wanted it
[1:09:30] to be.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. He said,
[1:09:33] "When the rain as the rain cometh down
[1:09:35] and it gives seed and bread, the same
[1:09:38] rain gives seed to the sewer and bread
[1:09:40] to the eater." Well, there's a mystery
[1:09:41] there. Amen. Because there's a process
[1:09:43] from of seed becoming bread, but it all
[1:09:46] comes by the same rain. Amen. And so
[1:09:48] when see when a good rain gives a good
[1:09:51] seed, Amen. you can be assured there's
[1:09:53] going to be good bread. Amen. Because it
[1:09:55] comes by the same law of God. He said,
[1:09:57] "That's my word that goes out of my
[1:09:59] mouth. It will not return to me void,
[1:10:02] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:10:05] please, and it will prosper into the
[1:10:08] thing whereto I sent it. I believe that
[1:10:10] God sent a message of adoption to this
[1:10:12] day. Amen. He said, and God planted a
[1:10:14] seed in his elected children, Amen. that
[1:10:16] even in Leosa, the darkest age, the
[1:10:19] darkest time, a time of confusion. Amen.
[1:10:22] If God said, Amen. If God said that that
[1:10:25] that that he was sending a message of
[1:10:27] adoption, Amen. then I'm expecting
[1:10:29] manifested sons. And but the but the
[1:10:32] beautiful thing about it, I don't have
[1:10:33] to worry about whether I'm going to
[1:10:34] figure it out or whether you're going to
[1:10:36] figure it out or how we're going to get
[1:10:38] together and get it solved or how we're
[1:10:40] going to try hard enough or how we're
[1:10:42] going to have a good enough program or a
[1:10:43] good enough teaching. Amen. No, I'm
[1:10:45] trusting in the seed. I believe when God
[1:10:48] swed this message into this age, the
[1:10:50] message came with power. As many as
[1:10:52] received me, he said they received power
[1:10:55] with it to become sons of God. He said,
[1:10:57] "We're predestinated unto adoption."
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there's a law in the seed of
[1:11:02] election that will bring you to your
[1:11:05] adoption. Hallelujah. You say, you know,
[1:11:08] that's the problem is is we're looking
[1:11:10] at all the external.
[1:11:12] We look at the husk. Amen. We look at
[1:11:15] the outside and not at that seed. Say,
[1:11:18] "Brother Nathan, I'm looking at the
[1:11:19] great call of the hour today. And I'm
[1:11:21] looking at what Brother Brandham said
[1:11:22] about this bride and who she would be.
[1:11:24] That she'd be an invincible army. that
[1:11:26] she'd be a sinless, spotless bride, that
[1:11:28] she would that she would do the greater
[1:11:30] works, that she would, you know, that
[1:11:32] that that that, you know, she'd have
[1:11:33] power for miracles and signs and wonders
[1:11:36] and supernatural God would be
[1:11:38] vindicating her and the pillar of fire
[1:11:40] would be with her. And I'm looking at
[1:11:41] all those things, Brother Nathan. But
[1:11:42] then I'm looking at me and I'm looking
[1:11:44] at the state of my life and and I
[1:11:46] believe the message, but when I look at
[1:11:48] me, I see that I'm so humble. I see that
[1:11:50] I'm so small and I see that I'm so weak.
[1:11:53] I can't believe, brother Nathan, that I
[1:11:55] could be the one that prophet was
[1:11:57] talking about. Amen. Well, then you just
[1:11:59] haven't seen the law of a seed. Amen.
[1:12:01] Because when you understand that law,
[1:12:03] it's not about how humble the seed is.
[1:12:05] It's not about how small or how weak or
[1:12:07] what kind of a condition that it's
[1:12:09] laying in. There's a law that's in a
[1:12:11] seed, amen, that will bring it up out of
[1:12:13] that condition. It'll bring it up to
[1:12:15] another pl. It'll bring a growth. It'll
[1:12:17] bring a maturity. Amen. Amen. And you
[1:12:19] see, you say, "Brother Nathan, you know,
[1:12:21] I'm looking at this great call of the
[1:12:22] hour, and I believe it, but I feel like
[1:12:24] I've only got a little Jesus, Brother
[1:12:26] Ben. Of everybody in the church, of even
[1:12:29] everybody in else in Sunday school or my
[1:12:31] youth group, of all of them, surely I've
[1:12:33] got the least amount of Jesus. I've only
[1:12:36] got a little bit of Jesus." Here's the
[1:12:38] thing about little Jesus. Little Jesus
[1:12:40] could go down to the temple. Amen. Just
[1:12:42] because of being who he was, never going
[1:12:45] to school, never being educated, but
[1:12:47] just being who he was, little Jesus
[1:12:49] could sit there and he could speak words
[1:12:51] that could confound the theologians of
[1:12:53] his day. Little Jesus, amen, could turn
[1:12:56] water into wine. Because the thing about
[1:12:58] little Jesus, if you got if all you got
[1:13:00] in your life is just a little bit of
[1:13:02] Jesus, it's still Jehovah Jesus. Amen.
[1:13:05] And a little Jesus is healer Jesus. Even
[1:13:08] a little Jesus, amen, is savior Jesus.
[1:13:11] It's peace Jesus. It's victory Jesus.
[1:13:14] Amen. It's all the Jesus that you need.
[1:13:16] Amen. It's just a little Jesus because
[1:13:19] little Jesus won't stay little. Amen.
[1:13:21] But little Jesus will grow. Brother Bram
[1:13:23] said when a man gets saved, a little
[1:13:25] button of light, he called it, just the
[1:13:27] size of a button on your shirt. Just
[1:13:29] that much light comes into a person.
[1:13:31] It's not a great big halo of light. It's
[1:13:33] not a big wheelbarrow full of light. He
[1:13:35] just puts a little button of light in a
[1:13:38] bornagain son or daughter of God. But he
[1:13:40] said, "What happens to that little
[1:13:41] button of light?" Amen. Is it from that
[1:13:43] time it'll begin to grow and that little
[1:13:46] button of light will push out and it'll
[1:13:48] begin to expand and it'll begin to push
[1:13:50] this way and push that way and all of a
[1:13:52] sudden that little button of light that
[1:13:53] he put in you will come into contact
[1:13:56] with depression and it comes into
[1:13:58] contact with sin and it comes into
[1:14:00] contact with unbelief and comes into
[1:14:03] contact with fear and it begins to push
[1:14:05] on those things. Amen. You you with all
[1:14:08] with us with all of our ability could
[1:14:10] never reach into a life and pluck those
[1:14:12] dark things out. But God puts a little
[1:14:14] button. He puts a little seed in a
[1:14:16] Christian. Amen. And then when you lay
[1:14:18] that seed under the word and keep it in
[1:14:20] the right atmosphere, it begins to push
[1:14:22] and all of a sudden it'll begin to push
[1:14:23] things out of your life that you had no
[1:14:25] power to remove. That's the power of a
[1:14:27] seed. That's the power of little Jesus.
[1:14:30] Brother said, "God doesn't have little
[1:14:31] weak spots that are weak and big heavy
[1:14:34] spots that are powerful. God didn't take
[1:14:36] all of his best power and his best life
[1:14:38] and put it into preachers and put it
[1:14:40] into prophets and put it into heroes of
[1:14:42] the faith. Amen. He said the least touch
[1:14:44] of God, Amen. You feel like I'm the
[1:14:46] least Christian here, but the least
[1:14:48] touch of God, Brother Bram said, is
[1:14:50] omnipotent. It's all powerful. All the
[1:14:53] power of deity lays in that little seed
[1:14:55] of life.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just keep it in the right
[1:14:58] atmosphere. Let it grow.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I like to tell this story. I I had a
[1:15:02] it's an old house that I had. It uh it
[1:15:05] had a It was in It was just in the
[1:15:07] middle of town and it had an ugly old
[1:15:09] fence. Brother Joel, this fence was
[1:15:12] falling apart. It was in disrepair. And
[1:15:14] I don't know if you all noticed, but
[1:15:15] fences aren't cheap. So, I didn't want
[1:15:17] to pay for a new fence. I just wanted to
[1:15:19] do something with the fence that I had.
[1:15:21] And so, I thought, well, what I'll do,
[1:15:22] I'll get a nice flowering vine and I'll
[1:15:25] I'll plant it around that fence. I'll
[1:15:26] let a flower, you know, some vines and
[1:15:28] flowers fill it up and that'll pretty up
[1:15:30] real nice and that'll do the trick. So,
[1:15:32] I went down to Menard's. Glory to God.
[1:15:35] And uh and I I was looking at what they
[1:15:37] had and I found a little plant called
[1:15:39] morning glory. If any of you gardeners,
[1:15:42] you're already laughing at me. But I
[1:15:44] thought, I like the sound of that.
[1:15:46] Morning glory. Don't you ever buy that
[1:15:48] stuff.
[1:15:49] So, I bought that morning glory and I
[1:15:51] took it home. I read on the back of the
[1:15:53] package it said just take one seed every
[1:15:56] six inches or so. Just one little seed.
[1:15:58] And I thought, brother Ben, I bought
[1:15:59] tons of this stuff. So what I did, I
[1:16:02] started at one side of my fence and I
[1:16:04] shook that stuff out all the way down to
[1:16:06] the other end. Listen friends, nothing
[1:16:08] happened that day. Nothing happened the
[1:16:10] next day. But after a little space of
[1:16:12] time, something started to happen in my
[1:16:14] yard cuz a seed had been planted. Amen.
[1:16:17] And that seed, it just just seemed like
[1:16:19] overnight it it grew up and it took over
[1:16:21] that whole fence and just filled every
[1:16:23] area of the fence. And praise the Lord,
[1:16:24] that's where I wanted it. I wanted it on
[1:16:26] the fence. But the problem with this
[1:16:28] life of that was in this seed. It won't
[1:16:30] stay where you want it. Amen. Because
[1:16:33] after a little while, it filled up the
[1:16:34] fence and then it left the fence and it
[1:16:36] went all in my yard and it went up my
[1:16:37] trees and it got in it went up the side
[1:16:39] of my garage and up the side of my house
[1:16:41] and it got into my vegetable garden and
[1:16:43] it started at the bottom of my tomato
[1:16:45] plants and it curled all the way up to
[1:16:47] the tippy top of those plants. Listen,
[1:16:49] weeds couldn't grow in my garden cuz it
[1:16:51] was too full of morning glory. Amen.
[1:16:54] Listen, friends, that's the kind of life
[1:16:55] God planted in you. Amen. And he look,
[1:16:57] he didn't ask you to figure everything
[1:16:59] out and solve all of your problems and
[1:17:02] find the power within yourself. He put a
[1:17:04] seed in you. And what we try to do, we
[1:17:06] try to take the seed of God's life and
[1:17:07] we say, "Well, it's fine if you only
[1:17:09] come this far. Just give me enough Jesus
[1:17:11] to go to church on Sunday morning. Just
[1:17:13] give me enough Jesus to sing a few songs
[1:17:15] and pay some ti." But listen, friends,
[1:17:17] if you ever really get converted, if you
[1:17:19] ever get really meet this quickening
[1:17:21] power, Amen. little Jesus won't stay
[1:17:23] little. But there's a life that he puts
[1:17:25] in a Christian. Amen. And it begins to
[1:17:27] take over. It'll begin to strangle out
[1:17:29] sin. It begins to push out, amen, fears
[1:17:32] and anxieties. Uh, amen. Because what it
[1:17:35] that's what it is. It's the life of
[1:17:36] Christ within you. It's the morning
[1:17:38] glory. It's the rising of the sun. I
[1:17:41] believe, you know, I believe to this
[1:17:42] day, you could drop a nuclear bomb on
[1:17:44] Finley, Ohio, where that house was. You
[1:17:47] could erase every memory of Nathan
[1:17:49] Ericson. But next spring, next spring,
[1:17:51] that morning glory is coming back just
[1:17:53] as sure as anything. That's no house.
[1:17:55] That's no high house plant. No, that's
[1:17:57] some kind of an original seed. Amen.
[1:17:59] That's what that's what God gives a
[1:18:01] Christian. Amen. It's a We look at
[1:18:02] things and we think, "How can I ever
[1:18:04] move this mountain? How can I ever get
[1:18:06] through this obstacle? How can I ever
[1:18:08] grow up out of this situation?" Look,
[1:18:09] friends, you don't have to do it. You
[1:18:11] trust the law of life that's already in
[1:18:13] you. God's not worried about it. It's us
[1:18:16] that are worried about it, but you can
[1:18:18] trust the seed today. There's power in
[1:18:20] it to become what he wanted it to be.
[1:18:22] Hallelujah. There's only one limitation
[1:18:24] on how far a seed can grow, and that's
[1:18:27] what season it's in. And we know by the
[1:18:29] message of the hour, this is adoption
[1:18:31] time. It's manifesting time. This is not
[1:18:33] a This is not a time for half-grown
[1:18:35] Christians. It's not a time for halfway
[1:18:38] Christianity. It's time to get serious
[1:18:39] with God and begin to and begin to
[1:18:41] hunger and thirst for everything God
[1:18:44] promised his church. Amen. It's not a
[1:18:46] time to wait on things to come. Now is
[1:18:48] the time to manifest who we are.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram said, "We're not in
[1:18:52] justification. We're not in
[1:18:53] sanctification. We're not in the
[1:18:55] Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[1:18:57] He said, "Right now, we're in the
[1:18:58] blossom." Amen. We're coming to
[1:19:00] adoption. It's rapture time. It's a time
[1:19:03] for rapture faith. It's a time for
[1:19:04] rapture life. Listen, friends, whatever
[1:19:07] in your mind, whatever limit you have
[1:19:09] put on your experience, whatever you
[1:19:11] think, Amen. Because every Christian's
[1:19:13] got some idea in their mind of the
[1:19:15] ceiling of their potential. And this is
[1:19:17] as far as I'll probably ever go with
[1:19:18] God. and this is as close as I'll ever
[1:19:20] be to heaven. And this is as much as
[1:19:22] I'll ever manifest him. And this is the
[1:19:24] most I'll ever be able to express his
[1:19:26] attributes. Throw it away today. Throw
[1:19:28] your idea away. This is manifesting
[1:19:31] time. Amen. Don't underestimate the
[1:19:33] power of a seed. Amen. This bride is a
[1:19:36] restored church. She's a restored tree.
[1:19:39] Amen. It's time for her to come into
[1:19:41] maturity. It's time to her to be
[1:19:42] manifested sons and daughters of God.
[1:19:44] It's us that put limits on it. It's us
[1:19:47] that put it off in a future day. It's
[1:19:49] not this word, but this word seed, amen,
[1:19:52] has brought a light to the church. You
[1:19:54] can lay under this message. You can be
[1:19:55] the kind of Christian you never thought
[1:19:57] was possible.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; You could be 10 times what you are
[1:20:00] today. I'm not talking about a
[1:20:01] charismatic idea, you know, of everybody
[1:20:04] needs to have a worldwide ministry and a
[1:20:05] Cadillac and a mansion and no and and
[1:20:07] and be some and be a somebody. I'm
[1:20:10] talking about a son or daughter of God
[1:20:12] being everything that God put the
[1:20:15] potential in them to be before the
[1:20:17] foundation of the world.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; I believe that, friend. I believe it's
[1:20:20] time for that.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Easter time, time to rise.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham preached on
[1:20:26] us. He preached on the pond lily.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And that's that overcoming Christian.
[1:20:30] And the thing about it is that
[1:20:31] overcoming Christian, you remember it.
[1:20:33] It comes through a journey. It doesn't
[1:20:35] the the way that it starts is not the
[1:20:37] way that it ends. Because when a seed is
[1:20:39] born, it's born down and and I thought
[1:20:41] it's amazing. He takes an act a pond
[1:20:43] lily of all the liies he could have
[1:20:44] worked with. He takes a pond lily and
[1:20:47] that pond lilyy's bu it it starts out
[1:20:49] buried down in the muck somewhere at the
[1:20:51] bottom of a pond, you know, and it's
[1:20:53] laying there and and it's laying there
[1:20:55] and when you pass over that seed, it
[1:20:58] doesn't look any different from all the
[1:21:00] rest of the dirt around it. Looks like
[1:21:01] all the rest of the pebbles and rocks
[1:21:02] and dirt. And that was some of you
[1:21:04] sitting in this church. Amen. when when
[1:21:06] the Lord got a hold of you that when
[1:21:08] that quickening power came to you, you
[1:21:10] weren't in a church. You might have been
[1:21:11] in a barroom. You might have been out in
[1:21:13] the world. You might have been doing
[1:21:14] whatever kind of thing and just just
[1:21:16] like looked just like everybody else,
[1:21:18] but you weren't like everybody else cuz
[1:21:20] there was a potential that was in there.
[1:21:22] And even though you were in a dark place
[1:21:24] and even though you were you were
[1:21:26] surrounded with filthy things, somehow
[1:21:29] someway a little ray of light came
[1:21:31] bouncing down those molecules of earth.
[1:21:33] Amen. And struck you just right. And
[1:21:36] something happened. A seed was
[1:21:37] quickened. It might not have been an
[1:21:39] explosion. It might not have heaved up
[1:21:41] the bottom of the pond. Maybe everybody
[1:21:42] around you didn't know what happened,
[1:21:44] but something happened. And from that
[1:21:46] time, it unlocked a law. Amen. A law of
[1:21:49] life. Amen. Because there was a lily in
[1:21:51] there that was wanting to be expressed.
[1:21:53] And so once that quickening happens,
[1:21:55] brother, it don't matter if it's in
[1:21:56] dirt. It doesn't matter if it's filthy.
[1:21:58] Because there's a life in it that won't
[1:22:01] let it stay there. It starts to push
[1:22:03] out. It starts to claw and fight and
[1:22:06] Amen. And oh, it gets dirtier fighting,
[1:22:08] but but something in it driving it
[1:22:10] upward and it'll push back on on the
[1:22:13] filth of the world. It pushes back on
[1:22:15] earthly things and Amen. And it begins
[1:22:17] to crawl its way up. Amen. And and begin
[1:22:19] it begins a journey. Amen. It still
[1:22:21] looks like all the rest of the dirt
[1:22:23] around it, but there's a there's a
[1:22:24] potential that's been unlocked. You
[1:22:27] remember how it was? There were things
[1:22:28] and you're looking around your life at
[1:22:29] all the filthy stuff you're caught up in
[1:22:31] and say, "How do I ever how am I ever
[1:22:33] going to get through this?" But some of
[1:22:34] you older ones remember there was a law
[1:22:36] of life. There was a little voice. There
[1:22:38] was a there was a force on the inside
[1:22:40] that you couldn't stay where you were
[1:22:42] at. You couldn't be satisfied. You had
[1:22:44] to push and strive. And that's what that
[1:22:46] little seed does. It fights its way up
[1:22:48] until all of a sudden there's a
[1:22:49] breakthrough.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You know the problem a
[1:22:54] lot of Christians have? They get to a
[1:22:56] breakthrough in their life. They have a
[1:22:57] real breakthrough experience maybe at a
[1:22:59] camp meeting or an altar or something
[1:23:00] like that and then guess where that lily
[1:23:02] is at? It's still at the bottom of a
[1:23:04] pond.
[1:23:05] Amen. And so, you know, from after that
[1:23:07] breakthrough, Amen. There's still a
[1:23:09] journey that Amen. There's a journey of
[1:23:11] sanctification. And that that that
[1:23:13] little lily plant, it starts to it
[1:23:15] starts to push up. But but you know,
[1:23:16] every little current that passes through
[1:23:18] that pond, Amen. It pushes it this way
[1:23:21] and it pushes it that way. And that lily
[1:23:23] is in a place where it's feeling so much
[1:23:25] influence from everything around it.
[1:23:27] Amen. And then look at and you look at
[1:23:29] around and look at all the other plants.
[1:23:30] Look at the look at look at the way I
[1:23:33] guess I would call it seaweed. I'm
[1:23:34] thinking of a freshwater plant. You know
[1:23:36] that lily could look at you know the
[1:23:38] ones you look at a little shallow stream
[1:23:39] somewhere and it's got that it's got
[1:23:41] that that those pl that that plant in
[1:23:43] there. It's got no backbone. It's got no
[1:23:45] strength or structure and just whatever
[1:23:47] way the currents going. It's just
[1:23:52] You know, and then the flood waters come
[1:23:53] and opinions change or currents change
[1:23:56] and it's a all of a sudden
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; and then Lily's looking at that. Amen.
[1:24:02] And and how many times in your life did
[1:24:04] you look at people around you say, "I
[1:24:05] wish I could just be a regular person. I
[1:24:07] wish I could just be like everybody else
[1:24:09] cuz they're not under the pressure that
[1:24:10] I'm under. They just go with the flow.
[1:24:12] They just do whatever feels good. They
[1:24:14] just do." But you couldn't be that cuz
[1:24:16] there was a law. There was a voice on
[1:24:17] the inside. Amen. that says no, but I'm
[1:24:19] not meant for here. I'm meant for higher
[1:24:21] things. Amen. I wasn't born for this.
[1:24:23] You You had a backbone. There was a
[1:24:25] structure. There was a strength. It
[1:24:27] wasn't that you didn't bend under the
[1:24:28] influence many times, but it was just
[1:24:30] that you weren't meant to stay there.
[1:24:32] Amen. And that's the lily. It'll fight.
[1:24:34] It'll prove what it is. It's a got a
[1:24:36] life in it that manifests all by itself.
[1:24:39] And it'll swim against the current.
[1:24:40] It'll go against the flow until it gets
[1:24:42] out, Brother Bram said, into the
[1:24:44] presence of the sun. And all of a sudden
[1:24:46] it can relax and it can open up that
[1:24:48] full blossom and a fragrance begins to
[1:24:50] come out of that lily life and a beauty
[1:24:52] that everybody else can enjoy the
[1:24:55] atmosphere of that lily life. Brother
[1:24:57] Bram said that's the overcomer. Now when
[1:24:59] you look at that overcomer a lot of us,
[1:25:01] you know, we suffer so much under guilt
[1:25:03] of the past. But brother Bram said,
[1:25:04] look, you can't take that overcoming
[1:25:06] Lily and say, "Oh, but he came out of
[1:25:08] the mud. I remember where brother so and
[1:25:10] so. I remember what he was mixed up in.
[1:25:12] I remember what kind of family she came
[1:25:13] out of. I remember what kind of a
[1:25:15] church, you know, uh, that was or I
[1:25:18] remember what what where he was at and
[1:25:19] what he was teach. No, brother Ben said
[1:25:21] you can't say he came out of the mud cuz
[1:25:23] he's not in the mud now. Where is he?
[1:25:26] He's on top. He's overcome. That's the
[1:25:28] overcoming. Christian friends, who you
[1:25:30] are is not where you've been through.
[1:25:32] Who you are is not where you came from,
[1:25:35] but who you are is the life that brought
[1:25:37] you out of it. It's the seed of of of
[1:25:41] gene identification on the inside. Amen.
[1:25:44] That's what called you up. You know, if
[1:25:46] you'd have had your way, you would have
[1:25:47] thrown in the towel. You would have been
[1:25:49] like everybody else. If it was if you
[1:25:51] had your way, you never would have left
[1:25:52] that filthy place.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; But a life. Amen. There was something
[1:25:58] awakened inside of you. A life, a seed
[1:26:01] that wouldn't let you stay there. Oh,
[1:26:03] what a beautiful type of this lily, this
[1:26:06] overcomer. Amen. Something in you that
[1:26:09] says you were made to overcome. Now,
[1:26:11] that's a powerful sermon. And brother
[1:26:12] Brandham preached that to the hilt on
[1:26:14] that overcoming Christian and how he's
[1:26:16] on top and how he's risen above things
[1:26:18] and now how he's got a fragrance to his
[1:26:20] life and a and and and an atmosphere.
[1:26:22] You know, Brother Bram said if you're a
[1:26:24] real Christian, remember in the token he
[1:26:26] said I think it was the token he said
[1:26:27] that people just love for you to say
[1:26:29] something to them. There's an atmosphere
[1:26:30] to your life. They know you're a
[1:26:32] Christian. They love to be in your
[1:26:33] presence. You got to Amen. There's
[1:26:35] there's a quality there. There's a
[1:26:36] virtue. What a powerful thing that is to
[1:26:38] in overcoming life. a Christian,
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; a lily, but it hits a little different
[1:26:44] for a young person who's still down in
[1:26:46] the muck
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; and battling some some of some earthly
[1:26:49] things. It hits different to a to a
[1:26:52] person, you know, who's just they're
[1:26:54] just struggling to go against the flow
[1:26:55] and they're down in the water somewhere.
[1:26:57] And there's a lot of Christians. Amen.
[1:26:58] If you're honest with yourself, you say,
[1:26:59] "Brother Nathan, I'm that's right where
[1:27:01] I'm at. I'm feeling so much influence of
[1:27:03] this world and I'm hearing so many
[1:27:04] voices and it's pushing and pulling on
[1:27:06] me and I'm confused and and I'm tired
[1:27:09] and I feel like I'm drowning.
[1:27:12] But here's what you got to get a hold
[1:27:13] of.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Here's what you got to get a hold of,
[1:27:16] brother, sister. Don't look at where
[1:27:18] you're at right now, but look at that
[1:27:20] seed life on the inside of you. Cuz that
[1:27:22] overcoming Christian, that lily, that
[1:27:25] beautiful flower, when it was down there
[1:27:27] in the muck, Amen. And when it was
[1:27:29] pushing through all kinds of filthy
[1:27:30] things, it was still a lily. Amen. When
[1:27:33] it was going against the flow and
[1:27:34] swimming against the tide, it was still
[1:27:36] a lily. All along the journey, it's the
[1:27:39] same lily life, friends. Oh, amen. If if
[1:27:42] you got enough Holy Ghost to get a
[1:27:44] revelation that you're a child of God.
[1:27:46] Amen. Then set your fear aside. Don't
[1:27:48] worry about where you're at, trust that
[1:27:50] seed. Amen. Trust that. Amen. Because
[1:27:53] there's a law that God put in that seed.
[1:27:55] It will not fail. Amen. to bring you up
[1:27:58] to where you belong. Amen. The problem
[1:28:00] is we get afraid because we're looking
[1:28:02] at our own ability. We're looking at our
[1:28:04] own strength. Don't trust your own
[1:28:05] strength. Amen. Don't don't lean on your
[1:28:07] own understanding. Amen. Trust the seed.
[1:28:10] Amen. Trust God's grace over your life.
[1:28:12] The same God that quickened you. The
[1:28:14] same God that sanctified you is the same
[1:28:16] one who will take you to your adoption
[1:28:18] and position and place you in the church
[1:28:21] as a fragrant, beautiful Christian.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we're trusting in
[1:28:25] today. Look friends, some of you, some
[1:28:27] of you come a long way with the Lord.
[1:28:29] And you know it was grace every step of
[1:28:31] the way. And it was if it had been up to
[1:28:33] you, you would have failed. But you
[1:28:34] couldn't fail. Amen. Because there was
[1:28:36] something in you that was testifying of
[1:28:38] where you came from. Amen. And the seed
[1:28:41] life that you came from had a law in it
[1:28:43] that that in the end it will reproduce
[1:28:45] where what the original life. Oh, what a
[1:28:49] blessed thing. That's what brother Bram
[1:28:50] taught. Restoration of the bride tree.
[1:28:52] Remember he talked about that law of
[1:28:54] life that's in a fish. the law of life
[1:28:56] that's in a bird. He said, "Now fish has
[1:28:58] got a law of life in it. He's made for a
[1:29:01] certain environment. He's made to live
[1:29:02] in a certain place, made to swim in the
[1:29:05] waters." But he said, it's a silly
[1:29:06] picture, but he said, "You take a fish
[1:29:08] and let that fish get in his mind, I'm
[1:29:11] going to be the best fish there ever
[1:29:12] was."
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; And so he go let him go up to the
[1:29:15] surface, get a great big gulp of air,
[1:29:17] say, "I'm going to be the best fish. I'm
[1:29:19] going to swim the fastest and dive the
[1:29:20] deepest, get a big breath of air, and go
[1:29:22] down." Brother Bram said he'll burst.
[1:29:24] Amen. Because there's a law of life in a
[1:29:26] fish, he don't have to try to be a fish.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. He don't have
[1:29:32] to work real hard to be a fish. And the
[1:29:34] harder he tries to be a good the best
[1:29:36] fish. Amen. The more he fails at being
[1:29:38] what he was. He said a bird, you know, a
[1:29:40] bird if he just says, "Well, I really
[1:29:42] want to fly. So maybe if I just run real
[1:29:44] hard and flap my heart my wings real
[1:29:46] fast and you know, I'm going to try I'm
[1:29:48] going to be the best bird. I'm going to
[1:29:50] fly the highest and and just try to work
[1:29:52] real hard at it." Brother Bram said
[1:29:53] he'll never get off the ground. Amen.
[1:29:55] Because there's already a law of life
[1:29:56] that's in a bird. He's got wings. And
[1:29:59] God already provided a wind. And so
[1:30:01] there's a there's an appointed
[1:30:03] atmosphere. There's an appointed
[1:30:04] condition. There's a law of life that's
[1:30:06] in a bird to fly. He don't have to work
[1:30:08] real hard at it. He just got to set
[1:30:10] those wings and let the wind get
[1:30:12] underneath him and lift him up. Friends,
[1:30:14] brother said, "And we have a law of
[1:30:16] life. It's not how hard we try to be a
[1:30:18] Christian. It's not how much we try to
[1:30:20] impress everybody. It's not how we turn
[1:30:22] over a new leaf and make up our minds.
[1:30:24] This time it'll be different. And this
[1:30:26] time I Oh, and I'll show everybody what
[1:30:28] a great Christian that I am. Amen. Brid,
[1:30:31] listen, friends. I believe the gospels
[1:30:33] for human beings. I believe God didn't
[1:30:35] send the word of God. He didn't send the
[1:30:37] Bible. He didn't send the message for a
[1:30:39] bunch of angels. He knew we were humans.
[1:30:41] He knew we'd have frailties. He knew
[1:30:43] we'd have weaknesses. But he knows
[1:30:45] there's a law of life in a human heart
[1:30:47] that if it could ever meet this
[1:30:48] quickening power, Amen. and get this.
[1:30:51] Amen. And get this law of life working
[1:30:53] on the inside of you. It's not how much.
[1:30:55] Brother Bram said, we fight and pull and
[1:30:58] hurry. Say, if I don't get this and if I
[1:31:00] don't get that, that's not it. It's to
[1:31:03] know that the law of life is in you.
[1:31:07] Thank God for that. The law of life is
[1:31:08] in you, then you just let go and let
[1:31:11] God. How many How many sermons have we
[1:31:13] heard on yielding? But what it really
[1:31:14] is, friends, it's yielding. It's
[1:31:16] recognizing the life that's already in
[1:31:19] you. It's not waiting for power to fall
[1:31:21] out of heaven. It's yielding to that
[1:31:23] seed that that little voice on the
[1:31:25] inside that says, "Uh, don't touch that.
[1:31:27] Oh, you better get yourself to church.
[1:31:29] Oh, you better." Oh, it's just yielding
[1:31:31] to what's already there.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a lot simpler than we make
[1:31:35] it.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; We work real hard at being Christians
[1:31:39] and letting everybody know what a great
[1:31:40] Christian that we are, a super super
[1:31:42] human. But brother Bram says, you just
[1:31:44] let go and let God. What a key. And then
[1:31:47] he takes you to your healing. Oh, he
[1:31:50] takes you to the baptism of the spirit.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And anything he's promised, he said, any
[1:31:54] claim that he's given is yours
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; by letting go and letting God.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful thing, friends. You
[1:32:03] see, that's the powerful thing about a
[1:32:04] lily. There's a there's a paradox here,
[1:32:07] you know, because uh Brother Brandham, I
[1:32:09] I was listening to him studying this,
[1:32:11] Brother Ben, and and I brother Bram, he
[1:32:13] just goes on and on about Reverend Mr.
[1:32:15] Lily, you know, you you could tell it
[1:32:16] was one of his favorites that he ever
[1:32:17] preached. And I I don't uh I don't know
[1:32:19] how much of it is on tape. I got the
[1:32:21] impression it's from the early days, but
[1:32:22] he would talk about it a lot about
[1:32:23] Reverend Mr. Lily, how that lily,
[1:32:26] remember how he's got to toil and he's
[1:32:28] got to work and push and strive, you
[1:32:30] know, to get up out of that ground and
[1:32:32] be the lily that he was supposed to be,
[1:32:34] put out his fragrance and how there's a
[1:32:36] battle to it. There's a striving and a
[1:32:38] toil and a work to get to get out and be
[1:32:41] that lily. It's a powerful sermon. And
[1:32:44] then I went and read what Jesus said. He
[1:32:46] said, 'Consider the lily. They toil not,
[1:32:50] neither do they spin.' I thought, well,
[1:32:52] there's a paradox. Brother Ram's going
[1:32:54] on on about how hard a a lily works.
[1:32:57] Amen. But Jesus said they toil not,
[1:32:59] neither do they spin. Listen, friends,
[1:33:02] but Jesus said, but Jesus said, with all
[1:33:05] your thought, with all your worry, with
[1:33:06] all your strain and striving, you can't
[1:33:08] add one cubit to your stature. And that
[1:33:10] illy can't that lily can't grow an inch
[1:33:13] by worrying about it, fighting about it.
[1:33:14] And here's here's what I think the
[1:33:15] paradox is. Is that is that sure you got
[1:33:18] to work to be a Christian. Sure, there's
[1:33:20] a pressure. There's a fight. There's a
[1:33:22] battle. There's a striving. There's a
[1:33:24] strain. Just like that lily. Sure, it's
[1:33:26] got to toil and spin and everything to
[1:33:28] get up out of the ground. But it doesn't
[1:33:30] have to work to be a lily.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters, you never
[1:33:35] worked one day in your life to be a
[1:33:37] child of God. It was never anything that
[1:33:39] you did. It was never anything that you
[1:33:41] knew. It was never what a great
[1:33:42] Christian or how long you were a member
[1:33:44] in the church. It was the grace of God
[1:33:46] to put a lily life in you by a seed of
[1:33:49] predestination. You don't have to work
[1:33:51] to be a child of God. You just have to
[1:33:53] yield, amen, to what God has already put
[1:33:55] in you. It was the grace of God that
[1:33:57] called us. It's the grace of God that'll
[1:33:59] help us grow. And it's the grace of God
[1:34:00] that'll put us in our adoption. The even
[1:34:03] the capstone crying grace, grace.
[1:34:05] Hallelujah. Let go and let God. Amen. If
[1:34:09] you're a son now, manifestation will
[1:34:11] come. And that's a beautiful thing. The
[1:34:12] Bible says it does not yet appear what
[1:34:14] we will be, but it also says right now,
[1:34:16] we are the sons of God. Amen. Oh my. You
[1:34:19] know, it does not yet appear. I believe
[1:34:22] I believe I'm a son of God. How many
[1:34:23] believe that of yourself?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm a son of God, but it does
[1:34:27] not yet appear what Nathan Ericson will
[1:34:29] be. You see, Nathan Ericson, I believe,
[1:34:31] if the Lord carries Nathan Ericen has
[1:34:33] not preached all the sermons that he is
[1:34:35] to preach. I've not done all the things
[1:34:37] that I'm to do. I've not manifested all
[1:34:39] the things and done all the exploits and
[1:34:41] done a and and and and grown into the
[1:34:43] character of the fullness of what Nathan
[1:34:45] Ericson is supposed to be. Amen. Cuz cuz
[1:34:48] if I'm a son of God, I've got a destiny
[1:34:49] and so do you. Amen. But look, it's
[1:34:52] becoming clear all it's becoming clearer
[1:34:54] all the time. Amen. And that's the
[1:34:56] beautiful thing about being a message
[1:34:58] believer today is to realize there's a
[1:35:00] law of life within you. it. We don't
[1:35:02] know, amen, what the fullness of a
[1:35:04] bright manifestation looks like. But the
[1:35:06] more time goes, the more clear it
[1:35:08] becomes when we see the Holy Ghost
[1:35:10] moving in this one and that one and this
[1:35:12] one and that one. The message of the
[1:35:14] hour is not a preacher cult of
[1:35:16] worshiping celebrities and heroes. Amen.
[1:35:18] It's individual hearts born again of the
[1:35:21] spirit of God with a seed of life on the
[1:35:23] inside manifesting who it is.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; It's God's bouquet. Amen. It's God's
[1:35:29] purpose being fulfilled in everyone.
[1:35:32] What a beautiful thing, friends. But
[1:35:34] just to know, look, just to know who
[1:35:36] what life is in you, that's that's the
[1:35:37] majority of the battle because then you
[1:35:40] can find your rest. Amen. That's the
[1:35:42] paradox of a Christian life there. We're
[1:35:44] pressing. How many are pressing through
[1:35:46] things? You got battles in your life and
[1:35:48] struggles. We're pressing, but we're
[1:35:50] resting.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; We're pressing, but we're resting, but
[1:35:54] the rest is in who we are. the
[1:35:56] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:35:58] you. Look friends,
[1:36:02] all that God asks of us is to be the
[1:36:04] kind of seed we are.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that that that seed,
[1:36:08] that little seed bursts into life,
[1:36:11] talking about that lily, but he said,
[1:36:13] "But it cannot do that until it goes
[1:36:15] through all that process."
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; We like that. We kind of like that skip
[1:36:20] to the end Christianity,
[1:36:22] but that's not the way it is, friends.
[1:36:24] we that he gave us the Holy Ghost to be
[1:36:25] a comforter to lead us into truth.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; His word is a light is a lamp to our
[1:36:30] feet, light unto our footsteps. In other
[1:36:32] words, sometimes this word, the only
[1:36:34] light we get out of it is just enough to
[1:36:35] take that next step. We don't know
[1:36:37] what's around the next bend. We don't
[1:36:38] know what's over the next hill.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but but see, it's trusting
[1:36:42] that you're walking in the light. And if
[1:36:44] all you got is enough is enough
[1:36:45] revelation from the Lord to take the
[1:36:47] next step. Amen. Then you could be sure
[1:36:49] that after that, Amen. the light will
[1:36:51] move forward and you'll see the next
[1:36:53] step. and you'll see the next step.
[1:36:54] Amen. And it's just footsteps with the
[1:36:56] Lord, trusting the law of life within
[1:36:58] you, trusting in his grace, trusting the
[1:37:00] message,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; walking in the light, knowing that he is
[1:37:03] in the light. Brother Br said, but it
[1:37:05] and that seed can't come into its
[1:37:07] blossom until it goes through all that
[1:37:09] process, and that's what makes it, he
[1:37:11] said, because the sun itself is what is
[1:37:14] drawing it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Watch this now. And when it when it goes
[1:37:18] fully above the dirty waters and muck
[1:37:20] and so forth, it's so happy. It gives of
[1:37:24] its life freely. And it just uh we'll
[1:37:27] just add this in with what we spoke last
[1:37:29] night to the young people. And brother
[1:37:30] Bram said, "And it's a beautiful life
[1:37:33] when it gets in the presence of that
[1:37:35] which is drawing it up."
[1:37:37] You know, you get in the real battles of
[1:37:39] the Christian life, especially
[1:37:40] especially young Christians and the ones
[1:37:42] that are way down there in the muck
[1:37:44] somewhere and fighting through real
[1:37:45] battles and or the ones that are down in
[1:37:47] the water somewhere. You can't you can't
[1:37:49] you you can't fully see the light. You
[1:37:51] can't fully you you maybe you've never
[1:37:53] even experienced, you know, uh uh just
[1:37:55] that full presence of God because of all
[1:37:57] the mind battles and because of all the
[1:37:59] struggles and condemnation and things
[1:38:00] that are laying on you. But look,
[1:38:02] there's something inside you. It's a
[1:38:04] seed life that says yes, but somewhere.
[1:38:07] Amen. There's a deep calling inside of
[1:38:08] me. That means somewhere there's a true
[1:38:11] Christianity. Somewhere there's an
[1:38:13] overcoming life. Somewhere there's a
[1:38:15] shakina glory. Somewhere there's a son.
[1:38:18] Amen. And and a place, amen, where I
[1:38:20] don't have to go against the flow and I
[1:38:22] don't have to push through the might.
[1:38:23] Somewhere there's an overcoming life
[1:38:25] where I can just rest in who I am and
[1:38:28] open up and blossom and and lay in the
[1:38:31] full presence of the sun. Look, the
[1:38:33] desire in the seed proves that there's a
[1:38:35] sun somewhere. And don't give up on the
[1:38:38] journey. Don't quit just because you're
[1:38:39] in a battle now. Trust the seed that's
[1:38:42] telling you, amen, that just a little
[1:38:44] further up is sunlight. Amen. Peace and
[1:38:47] rest. Amen. A beautiful life in the
[1:38:50] presence of the one that's been drawing
[1:38:52] you the whole time.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I believe that, friends.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; I believe that. I'm pressing through
[1:38:58] some things, but I ain't done yet. Amen.
[1:39:01] I I I'm going through a process of
[1:39:02] growth, but I'm going somewhere cuz I'm
[1:39:05] a seed of God. And you're a seed of God.
[1:39:07] There's no such thing as a seed without
[1:39:09] a purpose. There's no such thing as a
[1:39:12] child of God without a destiny.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; The same new birth, that same baptism of
[1:39:17] the Holy Ghost that quickens a seed is
[1:39:20] the same one. Remember, birth pains that
[1:39:22] testifies of an adoption, that there's a
[1:39:24] mountain somewhere with your name on it.
[1:39:27] Oh, it's not Listen, it's not it's not
[1:39:29] uh it's not Judah's mountain. I it's not
[1:39:33] it's not Levi's mountain. It's not No,
[1:39:35] no, it's your mountain.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; It's not Brother Brandham's mountain.
[1:39:38] It's not Brother Ben's mountain. It's
[1:39:39] your mountain. There's a there's a
[1:39:41] Christian life somewhere that belongs to
[1:39:43] you. And God put a seed in you to draw
[1:39:45] you up to that place. I tell you
[1:39:48] friends, I I believe in my on my darkest
[1:39:51] days, there's something in me that says,
[1:39:52] "Yes, but there's sunlight somewhere.
[1:39:55] There's a there's sunlight somewhere.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you learn we learn on our
[1:40:00] Christian journey, don't we?
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Just to trust that law of life,
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; you know, and all that God asks of us is
[1:40:06] to be the kind of seed we are. Look,
[1:40:09] Brother Bram said, you know, what we try
[1:40:11] to do, we're always trying to be a
[1:40:13] really impressive Christian, you know,
[1:40:14] and we're really trying to just uh make
[1:40:16] sure everybody knows just how spiritual
[1:40:18] and how revelated and how mature that we
[1:40:20] are. And we don't want anybody to know
[1:40:21] about any of our weaknesses or
[1:40:22] struggles. We got to keep that covered
[1:40:24] up or else people won't, you know,
[1:40:26] people won't be properly impressed with
[1:40:27] what a great seed that we are. But look
[1:40:29] friends, so what we try to do, we try to
[1:40:31] stack a bunch of liies up in the altar.
[1:40:33] We turn our whole Christian experience
[1:40:35] into a competition. We're just trying to
[1:40:37] out church everybody else in the church.
[1:40:39] And you know, we get in that mindset.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Be honest with yourself. But brother
[1:40:43] said, God doesn't care about liies on
[1:40:45] the altar. He wants you on the altar.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; God's not concerned about how, you know,
[1:40:49] what an impressive Christian you can be.
[1:40:51] He just wants you to submit to the law
[1:40:52] of life that's in you. God's in charge
[1:40:54] of bringing out of you what he wanted
[1:40:56] there to be.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; God's in charge of taking us to our
[1:41:00] adoption. Amen. He said he wants you on
[1:41:03] the altar. We try to live a
[1:41:06] I'm seeing something here. I I hope that
[1:41:08] I can express it well. Amen. But look
[1:41:11] look uh sometimes we get away from what
[1:41:14] I'll just I'll just coin the phrase from
[1:41:16] natural Christianity
[1:41:18] and we're always trying to take you know
[1:41:20] We're always trying to take human beings
[1:41:23] and twist them into something of what we
[1:41:25] think outwardly will represent what
[1:41:27] would please the Lord. And and and we
[1:41:30] twist people sometimes, hurt people
[1:41:32] sometimes, trying to just take the the
[1:41:35] real human honest heart and hide and
[1:41:38] cover all of that up and twist them into
[1:41:40] a shape of what we think is appropriate.
[1:41:43] But brother Bram said that's the thing
[1:41:44] about that lily. He said you take that
[1:41:46] lily and compare it to Solomon. Solomon
[1:41:49] in all his glory, dressed right,
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; kingly, impressive, had a position, had
[1:41:56] an authority. Everybody knew who he was,
[1:41:57] famous. Amen. Always in the spotlight,
[1:42:00] everything. But Solomon in all his
[1:42:02] glory, the Bible says, can't compare to
[1:42:04] a lily. Brother Bram says, because
[1:42:05] Solomon, no matter how rich, no, how
[1:42:07] advanced, Amen. how what a great king
[1:42:10] that he was and how much he impressed
[1:42:12] people, it was all artificial. But a but
[1:42:15] a lily's got a natural beauty. And
[1:42:17] that's what it is to me, friends.
[1:42:18] There's something beautiful about a
[1:42:20] young person who's not perfect. They got
[1:42:22] they make mistakes. They've got issues.
[1:42:24] They're struggling with things, but
[1:42:26] there's an honest heart that says, "But
[1:42:27] I want to serve the Lord. But I want to
[1:42:29] do right." Amen. That's beautiful. Amen.
[1:42:32] Because then to see the Lord work in a
[1:42:34] life like that, somebody honest enough
[1:42:35] to ask for help. Amen. To let the Lord
[1:42:38] come in and say, "Yeah, let that seed
[1:42:40] life just stay in the presence of the
[1:42:41] sun. Just get into church. Get under the
[1:42:44] word. Read your Bible and pray. and
[1:42:45] watch if that you don't grow right up
[1:42:47] out of that. Amen. What looks so dark to
[1:42:49] you. It looks like you'll never get past
[1:42:51] it. Amen. But oh my, it's a beautiful
[1:42:54] It's beautiful. Oh, Amen. It's not
[1:42:56] beautiful to me. Amen. For somebody to
[1:42:58] come into church and try to hide all
[1:43:00] their problems and and try to be a a
[1:43:02] perfect angel and make sure nobody
[1:43:04] thinks they got any mistakes and and get
[1:43:06] and be proud and be a somebody in the
[1:43:08] church and a leader in the community and
[1:43:10] all the things. That's artificial. Amen.
[1:43:12] But a beautiful life is a life that's
[1:43:15] surrendered to the law of God. You got
[1:43:17] filthy things to push through. You got
[1:43:19] to swim through the currents. Amen. But
[1:43:22] look, that's the Christian journey.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; And it's made for real human beings.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Real people.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's who God chose.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; He could have used angels, but he didn't
[1:43:35] want them.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; He chose human beings,
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; right? with weaknesses, with mistakes,
[1:43:41] frailties.
[1:43:43] Amen. But it's a beautiful life to walk
[1:43:45] in the grace of God. It's a beautiful
[1:43:47] life to struggle through things because
[1:43:49] the overcoming is that much sweeter. And
[1:43:51] we learn to trust him by the things that
[1:43:53] we go through and realize, oh, hey, you
[1:43:55] know, when I didn't when I didn't have
[1:43:57] the power, he sent his power. When I was
[1:43:59] weak, his strength was made perfect in
[1:44:01] my weakness. His grace is sufficient for
[1:44:04] me.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And ser it all serves a purpose.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; The things that we go through serves a
[1:44:12] purpose. That's the real sermon of this
[1:44:14] flower, you know, of this lily. That's
[1:44:17] what the Bible talks about. A flower and
[1:44:19] it it's a human life. It ain't it's not
[1:44:22] some angelic perfection. It's a human
[1:44:24] life. It's weak. It's frail, but it's
[1:44:26] beautiful. Amen. And and and that's what
[1:44:29] the Bible says about about our human
[1:44:31] journey. Look, friends, uh uh we're not
[1:44:34] here very long.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. We're not here very long. It's
[1:44:37] all right if I just talk to you for a
[1:44:38] minute.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; We're not here very long. I I got three
[1:44:41] kids now. I'm learning that real fast.
[1:44:43] It goes a lot quicker than you think.
[1:44:46] You know, the Bible says, "Man that is
[1:44:48] born of woman," this is Job's word, "Man
[1:44:49] that's born of women, he's of a few days
[1:44:51] and it's full of trouble." Ain't that
[1:44:53] the truth? He cometh forth like a flower
[1:44:56] and he's cut down. Peter said, "All
[1:44:58] flesh is as grass. The glory of man is
[1:45:01] the flower of grass, but the grass
[1:45:03] witherth, and the flower thereof fallth
[1:45:05] away, but the word of the Lord endureth
[1:45:07] forever.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, that's that's the very
[1:45:10] the very meaning of this flower. The
[1:45:12] very beauty of it is that it's fragile.
[1:45:14] A flower is not a great big oak tree,
[1:45:16] but a lily when it comes forth, it's
[1:45:18] fragile. Amen. I It's easily broken,
[1:45:21] easily cut down. It doesn't last very
[1:45:23] long. They don't bloom all year round.
[1:45:25] There's just a there's a moment in time,
[1:45:27] just a little set a point in time where
[1:45:29] that lily comes into its blossom and it
[1:45:31] brings a beauty and it brings a
[1:45:33] fragrance and then it's cut down. Even
[1:45:35] like a little dandelion, you know, it it
[1:45:37] just a it pops up just overnight. It
[1:45:39] wasn't there the day before almost and
[1:45:41] then the next day it's out and it and it
[1:45:43] brings forth a beauty and it's a pretty
[1:45:44] little yellow flower and then the next
[1:45:46] day it's gone. probably because my wife
[1:45:48] murdered it and you know it's been cut
[1:45:51] down by the lawn mower or run over with
[1:45:53] the weed and feed or whatever it is but
[1:45:55] but it's not not very long. That's your
[1:45:58] life. That's my life. I wonder if we
[1:46:00] don't uh uh meditate on that often
[1:46:02] enough that look friends, we're not here
[1:46:05] very long. You ever think about this?
[1:46:07] Look uh uh we we believe God sent a
[1:46:09] message to put a bride in a rapture, but
[1:46:11] not everybody in this world's going to
[1:46:12] be bride.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And and it ain't going to go on for a
[1:46:15] thousand years. It don't seem like it
[1:46:17] can go on much longer at all. Amen. So
[1:46:20] look, friends, there's only going to be
[1:46:22] so many people that'll believe this
[1:46:24] message. And there will be only so many
[1:46:26] people that'll live this message.
[1:46:28] There's only so many people that'll go
[1:46:29] out and witness of it, carry a testimony
[1:46:31] of it, spread the light to this world.
[1:46:33] There's only so many. So your life has
[1:46:36] such meaning. It has such value because
[1:46:38] it's so fragile, because it's so rare
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; and it doesn't last very long.
[1:46:43] Everything that we build here, you know,
[1:46:45] you can build a home, build a family,
[1:46:46] accumulate wealth, have a nice home,
[1:46:48] have a career, leave a legacy, all those
[1:46:50] kind of but give it a little time and in
[1:46:52] not very much time, it all fades away.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Fades away into the void,
[1:46:58] you know. But look friends, there's
[1:47:01] something in a in a seed life that
[1:47:03] testifies of purpose.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Because a flower, it's fragile. It's
[1:47:08] easily cut down. Amen. But it has a
[1:47:11] beauty. But it's not just beauty on
[1:47:12] itself. But look, Job could look down at
[1:47:15] that flower and he could see he could
[1:47:18] find purpose. Even in a little fragile
[1:47:20] life like that, he could see beauty. He
[1:47:22] could see purpose because it depends on
[1:47:23] the eyes of the beholder. The human
[1:47:25] life, brother, sister, it doesn't have
[1:47:27] much meaning. There's this world. This
[1:47:29] world can't offer I I just no matter
[1:47:31] where I've been, what career I've had,
[1:47:33] what kind of a job, I've never been able
[1:47:34] to find purpose in a job. I never felt
[1:47:36] that I was put here on earth just to
[1:47:38] make products and sell things and you
[1:47:40] know just have a house and amen and and
[1:47:42] and and and even even just a even just
[1:47:45] to to love your wife and love your
[1:47:47] children and all those things. Brother
[1:47:48] Bram said that's just the backdrop of
[1:47:50] your true purpose. But a true purpose of
[1:47:53] a human life is to testify of a of
[1:47:56] eternal life. And that's what it that's
[1:47:58] what gives it meaning friends. That
[1:47:59] flower doesn't mean anything but when it
[1:48:01] comes under the visage of a prophet.
[1:48:03] Amen. honor a prophet's view. Amen. A
[1:48:06] prophet could look down at that little
[1:48:08] flower and he could preach the great
[1:48:10] sermon on resurrection. Amen. That's
[1:48:12] what I want my life to be. While I'm
[1:48:14] here in the short time that I'm here, I
[1:48:16] want to live a life for Christ. Amen.
[1:48:18] That will testify that somewhere beyond
[1:48:21] the veil is a greater reality. Amen. Let
[1:48:23] the beauty of this Christian life
[1:48:25] testify of the beauty of heaven.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me purpose. Let me do
[1:48:30] something in time which will echo in
[1:48:32] eternity. Amen. That's what the message
[1:48:35] can give you.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's testifying of who you are.
[1:48:39] That you're here. Yeah. You're not here
[1:48:40] for a long time, but while you're here,
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; you got a purpose. Your life has
[1:48:46] meaning. The things that you express the
[1:48:48] character of God.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Means something.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; It has a value. Brother Bram said,
[1:48:54] "Look, see, see, I believe if you listen
[1:48:56] to that seed life within you, it'll give
[1:48:57] you a purpose-driven life. I don't
[1:48:59] believe in accidental Christianity."
[1:49:01] Come on.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, I believe that so so with
[1:49:04] all my heart. I do not believe, Amen,
[1:49:06] that that this church is in Hardy,
[1:49:08] Arkansas for no reason. I don't believe
[1:49:10] God raised up Ben Puit for no reason. I
[1:49:13] don't believe we're here together on
[1:49:14] Sunday morning for no reason. I believe
[1:49:16] in purpose. Amen. I believe that.
[1:49:18] Brother Brand said, look, he he he said
[1:49:20] that one time. He said he wanted you
[1:49:22] sitting there. He wanted me in the
[1:49:24] pulpit. He wanted you in that seat. He
[1:49:25] wanted this for a purpose.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The problem is with us, we we we
[1:49:30] get we're not listening to that seed
[1:49:31] life and and and so we we we we go after
[1:49:34] all these temporary things. But look,
[1:49:37] friends, there's a real purpose-driven
[1:49:38] life.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Look, and anything
[1:49:41] that serves God's purpose has got a
[1:49:43] resurrection."
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the things that we go
[1:49:47] through, what really gives them meaning?
[1:49:49] You're going to go through hard times.
[1:49:51] I'm going to go through hard times.
[1:49:52] Ain't everything going to be great?
[1:49:54] We're going to have trials. We're going
[1:49:55] to have unfortunate circumstances. All
[1:49:56] those things. But as long as it serves a
[1:49:59] purpose. Oh friends, that's what that's
[1:50:01] the beauty of that flower. Amen.
[1:50:03] Sometimes the flower is crushed. Brother
[1:50:04] Bram said that flower it it has to be
[1:50:06] crushed, but that's what brings the
[1:50:08] perfume.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Some of you Some of you were planted in
[1:50:11] places and you grew through all manner
[1:50:13] of hell to be sitting here today.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; But on the other side of that crushing,
[1:50:17] under the other side of that trial,
[1:50:19] wasn't there a sweetness? Wasn't there a
[1:50:22] savor? Isn't now now there's a
[1:50:23] compassion, a wisdom, an experience
[1:50:25] coming out of your life that could bless
[1:50:27] somebody else. It's all for a purpose,
[1:50:29] friends. Amen. And really, that's where
[1:50:31] my heart is at today. Say, Lord,
[1:50:33] whatever I got to grow through, whatever
[1:50:34] my journey, but let me come to a blossom
[1:50:37] and let me serve a purpose for you. Let
[1:50:39] my life under the visage of this message
[1:50:41] be a life of purpose, of meaning. Amen.
[1:50:44] Let me do something in time which will
[1:50:46] echo in eternity.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me a perfume, Lord. Even if I
[1:50:52] even where I'm where I've been crushed,
[1:50:54] let it be for your beauty.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Let it be for a saver.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Anything that serves
[1:51:00] God's purpose has got a resurrection,
[1:51:01] but it can only rise if it serves God's
[1:51:04] purpose."
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what he said. He said,
[1:51:06] "But you can't keep anything in the
[1:51:08] ground that serves God's purpose."
[1:51:11] Hallelujah. Friends, we we we we we've
[1:51:14] uh been awakened into this seed life
[1:51:16] here. You see your calling, brethren.
[1:51:19] Look, we we we might never be known in
[1:51:21] this world. We'll probably never be
[1:51:22] rich. We'll probably never see
[1:51:24] everything there is to see. We'll
[1:51:25] probably never do everything there is to
[1:51:26] do here in time. But look, friends, if
[1:51:28] we're here serving God's purpose, when
[1:51:31] that resurrection morning comes around,
[1:51:33] that perennial lily life will show what
[1:51:35] it is. Amen. All the powers of hell, all
[1:51:38] the powers of death can't keep you in
[1:51:40] the ground if you serve God's purpose. I
[1:51:42] thank God for this lily life. Amen. is
[1:51:45] something which settles me down and
[1:51:46] says, "Well, if I never taste that, if I
[1:51:48] never experienced that, if I never
[1:51:50] travel there, if I never get to do this,
[1:51:53] if I ever known that, Amen. There's a
[1:51:55] life on the inside of me that says
[1:51:57] somewhere on the other side, though the
[1:51:58] skin worms eat my body in my flesh, I'll
[1:52:01] see God." Amen. And I'll rule and reign
[1:52:04] a thousand years. I'd rather toil here.
[1:52:07] I'd rather be crushed here to be God's
[1:52:09] perfume. Amen. And wear a crown on that
[1:52:11] side. I'd rather have that eternal life.
[1:52:14] Amen. Then then get everything I want to
[1:52:16] out of this temporal life. I believe in
[1:52:18] purpose.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for purpose in my life. You
[1:52:22] everything serves God's purpose. And
[1:52:24] that see even the suffering, even the
[1:52:27] things that we go through, that's part
[1:52:28] of that human experience. Sometimes in
[1:52:30] our life, things happen and we get
[1:52:32] disappointed and we don't understand why
[1:52:34] it happened. You know, God's always
[1:52:36] gracious. He always gives us a little
[1:52:37] something to hold on to, you know, to
[1:52:39] just see that God was in it. But you
[1:52:41] know, it's very rarely we could see the
[1:52:43] whole purpose behind a tragedy, behind a
[1:52:46] loss. Look, you know, a couple years
[1:52:48] ago, a young couple just in the blossom
[1:52:50] of their life, 20 about 21 years old,
[1:52:53] young couple in our church, they had a
[1:52:55] propane explosion in their home. And and
[1:52:58] tragically, we lost them. Just a shock
[1:53:00] to the whole church. And moments like
[1:53:02] that, you know, what can you do? You you
[1:53:06] can't understand that little things will
[1:53:08] happen. And there are testimonies that
[1:53:10] come out of it. But we don't we from
[1:53:11] where we're standing as human beings, we
[1:53:13] can't see the whole picture. And you
[1:53:15] know as well as I do, there's moments in
[1:53:16] our human experience where you just
[1:53:18] throw up your hands to heaven and say,
[1:53:19] "Lord, why? Why did it have to be?" But
[1:53:22] look, friends, there's something on the
[1:53:23] inside says, "But yes, but as long as it
[1:53:25] serves God's purpose because God is a
[1:53:27] God of purpose." And even when we don't
[1:53:29] see all the purpose, we know that there
[1:53:31] is one. And that helps a lot to know
[1:53:34] that there's a purpose. Amen. That's
[1:53:36] what brother Bam said. He had a young
[1:53:38] man in his life that died in the prime
[1:53:39] of his life. Just a little just a young
[1:53:41] boy. But brother Bam said, "Look,
[1:53:43] sometimes God needs a bud in his
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; bouquet."
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; And so we say, "Oh, but they never they
[1:53:49] never had a chance to really blossom.
[1:53:51] Never had a chance to really come into a
[1:53:52] fold." But God needed that bud and his
[1:53:54] bouquet. Amen. It served his purpose. It
[1:53:57] was part of the beautiful thing that he
[1:53:59] was putting together. We we wonder why,
[1:54:01] but we trust in his purpose, knowing,
[1:54:03] Amen, that if if it serves God's
[1:54:05] purpose, you can't keep it in the
[1:54:07] ground. Amen. God might take our loved
[1:54:09] ones. He might take our children. Amen.
[1:54:11] But there's a time coming, amen, when
[1:54:13] everything that serve God's purpose will
[1:54:14] come back out of the ground. Hallelujah.
[1:54:17] Friends, what are we afraid of? Amen.
[1:54:19] There's a lily life on the inside of us
[1:54:21] testifying.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That all the powers of hell can't
[1:54:25] keep us, Amen. from coming up into what
[1:54:27] we're meant to be. God's building
[1:54:30] bouquet, brother, sister. Amen. He's got
[1:54:33] the preacher. He's got the prophet. He's
[1:54:34] got the singer. He's got the deacon.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; But what's your po What's your purpose?
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; What's your purpose? What is it in your
[1:54:42] life God planted in you? Amen. You've
[1:54:44] got a color, a fragrance, a blossom
[1:54:47] that's not like anybody else. But Amen.
[1:54:50] But what I want to do, I I don't I'm not
[1:54:53] a daisy that wants to be a rose. I'm not
[1:54:55] a tulip that wants to be a
[1:54:57] chrysanthemum. I I want to be me. Amen.
[1:55:00] And I just want but I just want to
[1:55:01] blossom into the life that I'm meant to
[1:55:04] live. And I want to fulfill God's
[1:55:05] purpose.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; That's why God gathers us together.
[1:55:08] That's why he puts a church together.
[1:55:10] This church can't be what it is without
[1:55:12] you.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You're indispensable
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; to the economy of God. It's part it's
[1:55:17] all part of flower. God's God's a flower
[1:55:19] garden.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Bram said. He
[1:55:22] preached God in simplicity. Talked about
[1:55:24] that flower and he was dedicating his
[1:55:26] church. He said, "Look," he said, "but
[1:55:27] the beauty of a church." I thank God,
[1:55:29] you know, we thank God for improvements
[1:55:30] that are made and how we can have nice
[1:55:32] air conditioning and have some nice
[1:55:34] amenities and upgrade things. And we we
[1:55:36] thank God for all those things, but the
[1:55:37] beauty, he said, is not the building.
[1:55:40] It's not No, but the beauty of a church,
[1:55:42] he said, is the character of the people.
[1:55:44] Amen. And friends, I want with all my
[1:55:46] heart, I just want that beautiful life.
[1:55:48] I want to live in his presence and I
[1:55:50] want to come to a blossom. Amen. Where I
[1:55:52] got my place in the bouquet. Amen. and
[1:55:55] know that I served his purpose and know
[1:55:57] on that resurrection morning I'll have
[1:55:59] been here for a reason.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what you want, church?
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the character of the people.
[1:56:07] Oh my.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what this message is all
[1:56:11] about. Purpose.
[1:56:14] Purpose. Seed of God.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; He gathers this one. He plucks up this
[1:56:18] one. Some of you say, "Oh, Brother
[1:56:19] Nathan, I had to grow what I you if you
[1:56:22] knew what I come through. He said, "You
[1:56:24] know, we got these young people in this
[1:56:25] church. They're growing up in a nice
[1:56:26] stable church and a good family and
[1:56:28] hearing good preaching. I came through
[1:56:30] all kinds of barbed wire and cement and
[1:56:32] I can't if you only knew what I had to
[1:56:33] fight through. Yeah. But you got your
[1:56:35] place in the bouquet just the same as
[1:56:37] the other. And God had a purpose and
[1:56:39] bring in this one from that background.
[1:56:41] This one came through these family
[1:56:42] struggles and this one came through that
[1:56:44] church hurts and this one came out of
[1:56:45] the world and they all came from
[1:56:47] different places. But it's God that
[1:56:48] gathered it together so that you could
[1:56:50] serve a purpose. and the one next to you
[1:56:52] and all. When you put it all together,
[1:56:54] it's a bouquet of Christian liies.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. With a fragrance, with a beauty,
[1:56:59] with a meaning.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that, friends.
[1:57:03] That's why God sent a message. Remember,
[1:57:05] he said the message is not to the group.
[1:57:07] It's not to the organization. It's a
[1:57:10] message to the individual to bring out
[1:57:12] of you the life that's in that seed.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; See, to to be Amen. to to be all that
[1:57:19] you were meant to be. So when you put
[1:57:21] the whole thing together, Brother Brand
[1:57:23] said, "What it'll be when you put that
[1:57:24] whole bride together, when she
[1:57:26] recognizes who she is,
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; the rapture will take place." Amen.
[1:57:30] Because she's come into full view to be
[1:57:33] an expression.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; An expression. That's what a bouquet is.
[1:57:37] That it's an expression of love.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; You know, when I when I let's say
[1:57:42] hypothetically, I bought my wife some
[1:57:44] flowers. probably been a little too long
[1:57:46] since the last time, but you know, you
[1:57:48] buy your wife some flowers and and
[1:57:50] gather gather all those together and put
[1:57:51] it together. It's there it's not just a
[1:57:54] it's not a gathering for no reason.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose. There's a message.
[1:58:00] See, that's that's why God raised up a
[1:58:02] church like this in a community.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It ain't just to put it together
[1:58:06] and look nice. There's a message.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose. And the purpose is a
[1:58:10] message of love to a bride. Oh, amen.
[1:58:14] And so you put that together and take
[1:58:15] those flowers to my wife, hand her that
[1:58:18] bouquet.
[1:58:19] She never asks me, "Oh, what field did
[1:58:23] those come out of?"
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What store did you buy them at?
[1:58:28] Who sold it to you? Oh, yeah. How was
[1:58:30] the traffic coming home? You know,
[1:58:33] that's not where her mind is at. It's
[1:58:34] not where it's not the question about
[1:58:36] it.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; And God, see, it's the same thing with
[1:58:38] the message. God didn't send a message
[1:58:39] so he'd say, "Okay, but who who what
[1:58:41] church do you go to and who's got the
[1:58:42] best, you know, who's got the most
[1:58:44] anointed ministry and who's got the
[1:58:46] biggest congregation and who's got the
[1:58:47] nicest building and who's got, you know,
[1:58:49] and and who's teaching this and who's
[1:58:51] teaching that and what's the current
[1:58:52] events and what's got and you know,
[1:58:53] what's the latest gossip and all the
[1:58:55] doesn't matter.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Not important." Amen. What matters in
[1:58:59] this message is the expression of God's
[1:59:02] heart to gather a bride together. Amen.
[1:59:05] that each one could come in a blossom
[1:59:07] and be gathered together. Amen. To serve
[1:59:10] God's purpose and show a message of
[1:59:12] love. This message is all about God's
[1:59:14] love for his bride. It's all about his
[1:59:16] love for an individual person. That's
[1:59:18] why he put us together. That's the kind
[1:59:20] of life I want to live. I don't want to
[1:59:22] get distracted with all these things
[1:59:23] that don't mean anything. I want to live
[1:59:25] a life for Christ that somebody could
[1:59:27] feel his love
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; through me and know the beauty of his
[1:59:31] presence. I want to have the kind of a
[1:59:33] church where it don't matter if it don't
[1:59:35] matter we got 10 people or 10,000 as
[1:59:38] long as the presence of Lord of the Lord
[1:59:40] is in that church and somebody can come
[1:59:42] in and and and see the bouquet of what
[1:59:44] God has put together and and and get the
[1:59:47] message get the message of love.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[1:59:53] Amen. Look friends, you walk into a
[1:59:55] house and you see a bouquet.
[1:59:58] That's the way it ought to be anytime.
[2:00:00] when somebody ought to be able to walk
[2:00:01] off the street into this church. Amen.
[2:00:04] And look around. Amen. And see that
[2:00:06] bouquet. Now, when you see that bouquet,
[2:00:08] it's there's a testimony with it. It's
[2:00:11] testifying of a love affair going on.
[2:00:14] You see, you walk into that house, you
[2:00:15] know, if it's just a bunch of wilted
[2:00:17] flowers, dried up hearts, cold formal
[2:00:20] Christianity, no love for one another,
[2:00:22] no Amen. No desire to serve God's
[2:00:24] purpose, just going through the motions
[2:00:26] and keeping the rituals and Sunday going
[2:00:28] meeting Christianity. Well, you know,
[2:00:30] then then there's no witness to that.
[2:00:32] There's no message to that. But when you
[2:00:34] walk into a house and you see a fresh,
[2:00:37] vibrant, amen, wellwatered bouquet of
[2:00:40] flowers and you smell that fragrance and
[2:00:43] you see that beauty, it's a there's a
[2:00:45] love affair going on in this house. You
[2:00:48] might not see the bridegroom. Amen. He
[2:00:50] might not be home. He might be out
[2:00:51] fixing up a better place for his little
[2:00:53] wife to live. Amen. But just by knowing,
[2:00:55] but just by seeing that bouquet in the
[2:00:57] arms of a bride. Amen. And you know that
[2:00:59] there's a love affair going on. That's
[2:01:01] the life I want to live for him. Amen.
[2:01:04] To know that that that when they see me,
[2:01:06] Amen. They see God's love. They feel his
[2:01:09] presence. They see the beauty. They see
[2:01:11] the message. They get the message.
[2:01:14] That's what the message is. It ain't a
[2:01:15] bunch of doctrines to argue about. It's
[2:01:18] a life
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; on display. It's a bouquet. It's
[2:01:23] individual purpose.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. And I I'm coming down to a
[2:01:28] close. Can I just share one more little
[2:01:30] thought? You know how little you know
[2:01:32] how little girls used to do? I I guess
[2:01:34] it's oldfashioned. I think it goes way
[2:01:36] back actually, maybe like Victorian
[2:01:38] times or something. Remember what they
[2:01:40] used to do? They take a flower, start
[2:01:42] picking off the petals. Remember, he
[2:01:45] loves me. He loves me not. He loves me.
[2:01:50] He loves me not. Well, you get all the
[2:01:51] way around, you get to that last petal,
[2:01:52] that's how you find out whether he loves
[2:01:54] you or not. Of course, you know what the
[2:01:56] secret is? You got to you got to pick
[2:01:58] the right kind of flower because it
[2:02:00] changes the message. If it's an odd
[2:02:02] number of petals or if it's even number
[2:02:03] of petals and you get the right kind of
[2:02:05] flower, he'll love you every time. And
[2:02:08] look, friends, that's what you really
[2:02:09] hear this message right. You really get
[2:02:11] it. If it when it really becomes God's
[2:02:13] purpose and you and you see that that
[2:02:15] life, that law of life working inside of
[2:02:17] you, Amen. Then you you can you can you
[2:02:20] can you can walk away from that love me
[2:02:22] love me not Christianity all that
[2:02:24] condemnation saved today and lost
[2:02:26] tomorrow and mercy today and wrath
[2:02:28] tomorrow friend. No, that's not what he
[2:02:30] chose you for. It's not your purpose.
[2:02:32] But he chooses vessels of mercy to fill
[2:02:34] them up with mercy so full that mercy
[2:02:36] would spill out of us. Amen. That an
[2:02:38] atmosphere that a that a river of living
[2:02:40] water would flow from us. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:43] And and we would know as we look around
[2:02:45] God's bouquet. That's why I love to
[2:02:47] fellowship with the bride of Jesus
[2:02:49] Christ because everywhere this message
[2:02:50] is preached, I find life. And when I
[2:02:52] look at that life, there's a message in
[2:02:54] that life.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; He loves me.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; He loves me.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; I hear brother Ben preach, I find out he
[2:03:02] loves me. Hear my sister play the piano.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; He loves me.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I see this group of young
[2:03:09] people. I see sincere hearts. I see how
[2:03:11] the Lord is working in a new generation.
[2:03:14] He loves me.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; He loves me. And every everything you
[2:03:17] pick at, you pick at people that we take
[2:03:18] this message. We try to pick each other
[2:03:20] apart, but start picking at those
[2:03:21] pedals. Start looking at the testimony
[2:03:24] of God's grace. Start looking at that
[2:03:25] life on display. It's got a very
[2:03:28] different message to it. You find out,
[2:03:29] oh, it's love, love, love, love. This
[2:03:32] message is so full of love. I know
[2:03:34] people turn it into legalism and try to
[2:03:36] grind people down in the dirt, but if
[2:03:38] it's a real seed, it don't matter how f
[2:03:40] how how hard you stamp on them. The law
[2:03:42] of life will bring them up out. Amen.
[2:03:44] and it'll bring us to that beautiful
[2:03:46] life.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting it.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting that seed. Hallelujah.
[2:03:51] Let's all stand. I appreciate your
[2:03:54] welcome spirit today.
[2:03:56] Brother Brandon preacher, I know my
[2:03:58] redeemer liveth. Talking about that
[2:04:00] resurrection life. He said, "Nothing can
[2:04:02] destroy it. It's been planted.
[2:04:06] It is the seed of God. It's a purpose of
[2:04:10] God to give us the blessed Holy Spirit.
[2:04:13] It's the purpose of God to show us signs
[2:04:16] and wonders and miracles. It's the
[2:04:18] purpose of God and nothing can destroy
[2:04:21] it. All powers of hell might wage
[2:04:24] against it, but it will prevail. He
[2:04:27] said, "We have God's eternal promise.
[2:04:28] There may be teachers. There may be isms
[2:04:30] rise. There may be great programs rise.
[2:04:32] There might be things that look like
[2:04:34] it'll be destroyed, but it can never be
[2:04:37] destroyed." You accept that for your own
[2:04:39] life today. Lord, I I spend so much time
[2:04:43] worrying and fearing about how I'll get
[2:04:45] to that next level, but Lord, I'm going
[2:04:46] to yield to the law of life within me.
[2:04:50] It can never be destroyed. It's the
[2:04:52] purpose of God, he said, to see that it
[2:04:53] will prevail. Then, I love these words.
[2:04:56] Then, it's not up to me and it's not up
[2:04:59] to you whether it'll be destroyed or
[2:05:01] not. It's up to God.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And he said, "And we
[2:05:05] can rest assured on it that God will
[2:05:06] never let our heritage be destroyed for
[2:05:10] it's his purpose to give it to us." How
[2:05:12] many want to serve his purpose today?
[2:05:14] Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[2:05:16] Lord Jesus,
[2:05:18] I thank you for the words of life today.
[2:05:20] Lord, I pray that they would inspire a
[2:05:22] heart. Lord, will you forgive us today,
[2:05:25] Lord,
[2:05:27] for how we try and strain and press,
[2:05:30] Lord? And we're always trying to peel
[2:05:32] that little seed open and try to pull
[2:05:34] something out of it, Lord.
[2:05:36] But, Lord, we want to learn how to
[2:05:38] surrender. We want to learn how to
[2:05:39] yield, Lord. We want to get to a place
[2:05:42] where we're trusting that law of life,
[2:05:44] Father, where the fear and the and the
[2:05:46] condemnation, Lord, would just slip
[2:05:48] away, Lord. And we would just trust your
[2:05:50] leadership, Lord. Lord, let us follow
[2:05:53] that little voice on the inside up into
[2:05:56] that beautiful life. Lord, I pray that
[2:05:57] each one here would serve their purpose.
[2:06:00] Lord, we're not trying to imitate one
[2:06:02] another. Lord, we just want to fit in
[2:06:04] your bouquet. Lord, we want to be, Lord,
[2:06:06] what you made us to be. We want that
[2:06:09] natural Christianity, Lord.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; That literal life, Lord. We just want to
[2:06:13] get out of the way that it could express
[2:06:15] itself. I pray for this local church,
[2:06:17] Lord. Lord, you put this bouquet
[2:06:20] together. And I pray, Lord, they would
[2:06:21] open up and shine like never before.
[2:06:24] Lord, that each one would have such a
[2:06:26] sense of purpose, Lord, by the sea
[2:06:28] that's in them, Father. Lord, that a
[2:06:31] fragrance would come out of Hardy,
[2:06:32] Arkansas, Lord, will come out of Word of
[2:06:34] Life Tabernacle. Lord, that this whole
[2:06:37] community, Lord, would catch catch it,
[2:06:39] Lord. That they would see the beauty,
[2:06:41] Lord, of lives on display. That there'd
[2:06:43] be a testimony, Lord, of this message of
[2:06:46] love. bless them in a special way, Lord.
[2:06:48] I thank you for an opportunity to be
[2:06:50] part of their weekend to fellowship with
[2:06:52] them, Lord, for friendship. I pray for
[2:06:54] each one of us, Lord Jesus, that we
[2:06:56] could only if we could only serve your
[2:06:58] purpose and do something in time, Lord,
[2:07:01] which would glorify you in eternity.
[2:07:04] We're so inspired by your word, Lord.
[2:07:06] And we pray it would touch a heart and
[2:07:08] courage, Lord, in Jesus name. We commit
[2:07:10] it to you. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you.

[2:31:59] wrestled with the Lord.

[2:32:08] I stood upon his holy word.
[2:32:13] Well, I would not be denied.
[2:32:18] No, I would not be denied.
[2:32:23] Till my Jesus came and he made me whole,
[2:32:29] I would not be denied.
[2:32:33] Well, oh, Satan said, "My Lord was gone
[2:32:39] and would not hear my prayer."
[2:32:43] Oh, but praise the Lord, the work is
[2:32:48] done. And Christ our Lord is here.
[2:32:53] Well, I would not be denied.
[2:32:59] Oh, I would not be denied
