[45:35] we're going to read from Philippians
[45:41] 22 acts 21 and Philippians
[45:44] 2:2 is it good to be in the house of the
[45:47] Lord on a Wednesday night I trust that
[45:49] it is
[45:58] says and when the day of Pentecost was
[46:00] fully come were all with one
[46:05] Accord in one place and were all with
[46:09] one Accord in one place then Philippians
[46:12] 2
[46:23] two says fulfill you my joy that you be
[46:28] likeminded having the same love being of
[46:32] one
[46:33] Accord of one mind the Lord would add
[46:36] his Blessing to the word I want to you
[46:37] may be seated I want to speak on with
[46:40] one
[46:42] Accord on the day of Pentecost they were
[46:47] there on
[46:48] purpose they were there because Jesus
[46:51] told them to be there I think we could
[46:54] say the same thing about our service
[46:56] tonight
[46:57] we're here because he told us to come
[47:00] together to assemble ourselves together
[47:03] and worship and to wait on the promise
[47:05] of the father we're not waiting on the
[47:07] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has already
[47:09] been given we're waiting on the promise
[47:11] of this hour which is the rapture of the
[47:13] church the change of our body so we're
[47:15] waiting on that and we believe but
[47:17] there's many other promises that we're
[47:19] waiting on tonight we're waiting on the
[47:22] promise of healing some of us we're
[47:23] waiting on our children maybe to be
[47:26] saved or
[47:27] or something to take place and and so
[47:29] we've got a goal in mind there's a uh
[47:32] there's a purpose why we're here and and
[47:35] I think that we should enter every
[47:37] service that way so they they wanted to
[47:40] be there they had the same goal in mind
[47:43] they were in one Accord and it was nice
[47:47] that nobody had to drag them to church
[47:49] they I just love to have church with
[47:51] people that want to be in church and and
[47:53] that want to be Fellowship around the
[47:55] word not just to be in a church church
[47:57] but to Fellowship around the word don't
[47:59] you just love having church with people
[48:01] who believe the message of the hour who
[48:03] just love it and and they'll back the
[48:05] word not because of who's saying it but
[48:07] because it's the word of God right
[48:10] because it's
[48:11] true and so it's just a wonderful
[48:14] feeling to know that you that you have
[48:17] one goal you've got one you're in one
[48:19] Accord you've got one mind and that's
[48:22] what one Accord actually means the word
[48:24] Accord in the original is from a a Greek
[48:26] word homothumadon which means
[48:28] unanimously or with one mind it comes
[48:31] from a root word from two root words
[48:33] which is homos which is the same and
[48:35] through most which is passion I believe
[48:37] we ought to have the same passion as as
[48:40] as they did back then to see the baptism
[48:44] of the Holy Ghost among us to see God
[48:46] move among us to to see the power of God
[48:49] manifested in our lives we don't want it
[48:51] just to be letter we don't want it just
[48:53] to be a a ritual that we go through
[48:56] something we do on Wednesdays and we do
[48:58] on Sundays we want it to be real sir and
[49:01] so if it's going to be real it's got to
[49:03] bring us into one Accord we got to want
[49:05] that we got to desire that or we'll
[49:09] never have
[49:11] it and so you know this doesn't mean
[49:14] that they were all in agreement on where
[49:16] to
[49:18] eat right or what to eat it doesn't mean
[49:23] that they were all in agreement on what
[49:24] color to paint the church yeah right it
[49:28] doesn't mean they were all in agreement
[49:30] on who the leadership should
[49:32] be right it doesn't mean they were all
[49:34] in agreement on those things but they
[49:35] were all in agreement on the things that
[49:39] matter and it's important when we come
[49:42] to the house of God it it's it's life or
[49:46] death we come out of here Better or
[49:48] Worse right and our kids deserve those
[49:51] breakthrough Services they deserve to be
[49:54] in the presence of God they deserve to
[49:56] have God moving among them we all of us
[49:59] need that we need the spirit of God to
[50:01] move Among Us and in order to do that
[50:03] we've got to be of one
[50:05] mind we we've got to get put everything
[50:08] else out of the way and our little
[50:10] difference in society and say Lord we we
[50:12] want you to move today we don't care who
[50:15] you move through we don't care in what
[50:17] manner you move but we want you to
[50:21] move and that's what we want we don't
[50:24] care if somebody else gets to sing or
[50:26] somebody else gets to preach or somebody
[50:28] else gets to gets the glory we want you
[50:30] to have the glory Lord we want to be in
[50:33] one Accord in one place and that's a
[50:35] powerful thing when you come in
[50:38] agreement in what
[50:40] matters I wonder how many of us tonight
[50:43] would say that we want to see
[50:45] Souls added to the church and added to
[50:49] the kingdom of God how many can say
[50:51] you'd like to see Souls born again I
[50:53] think every one of us would like to see
[50:55] that we like see the church filled up we
[50:57] like to see our kids up here in the
[50:59] front row every one of them have a real
[51:00] experience with God and and be filled
[51:02] with the Holy Ghost and never have to go
[51:04] out and experience the world we'd like
[51:06] to see that wouldn't we wouldn't you
[51:09] like to see that look at the book of
[51:10] Acts in Acts 246 it says they continuing
[51:13] daily with with what with one Accord in
[51:16] the temple and breaking bread from house
[51:18] to house that eat their meat with
[51:20] gladness and singleness of heart
[51:22] praising God and having favor with all
[51:25] the people and the Lord what happened
[51:28] because they were in one Accord see they
[51:30] didn't just come in one Accord at
[51:32] Pentecost but they come in one Accord
[51:34] after Pentecost and they continued to be
[51:37] in one Accord and when they were in one
[51:40] Accord they the the Lord added to the
[51:42] church daily such as should be saved so
[51:46] if you want to see Souls born in the
[51:48] kingdom of God you got to get in one
[51:50] mind about the things that
[51:53] matter are you with me so far it's
[51:55] listen to me Church I've got a burden on
[51:57] my heart tonight and I want to try to
[51:58] express it in the best way that I can
[52:00] it's not so important who shows up and
[52:02] how many show up but are the ones that
[52:05] are there in in one Accord in one mind
[52:07] Lord we want to see you move tonight we
[52:09] want to hear your word we want to hear
[52:11] you speak to
[52:13] us that's what's
[52:16] important the Lord adds to the church
[52:19] when those the church is in one
[52:22] Accord how many want to see the church
[52:24] refilled with the Holy Ghost
[52:27] amen how many need that I mean I think
[52:29] all of us could say every one of us need
[52:31] to be refilled with the baptism of the
[52:33] Holy Ghost we all need as brother brand
[52:36] said in deep call to the Deep an
[52:37] oldfashioned Holy Ghost Revival every
[52:39] one of us could say that and in Acts 4
[52:43] we find again that they continued in one
[52:45] Accord when he said when they heard that
[52:47] and what had happened is the Pharisees
[52:49] and the Sadducees had told them Don't
[52:51] Preach no
[52:52] more all right we live in that kind of
[52:55] an age too when the Devil's trying to do
[52:57] away with
[52:58] preaching and and he said don't they
[53:00] said Don't Preach no more don't testify
[53:02] about Jesus don't tell the people what
[53:04] he's done and when they heard that they
[53:07] lifted up their voice to God with one
[53:09] Accord with one Accord and said Lord
[53:12] Thou Art God which has made Heaven and
[53:14] Earth and the Sea and all that in them
[53:16] is who by the mouth of thy servant David
[53:18] has said why did the Heathen rage and
[53:20] the people imagine vain things if you go
[53:23] down to verse 29 it says and now Lord
[53:25] behold they're threatening and Grant
[53:27] unto thy servants that with all boldness
[53:29] they may speak Thy word they didn't ask
[53:31] for a way out of the persecution they
[53:33] didn't ask even that the persecution
[53:34] would stop they just said Lord give us
[53:37] boldness oh I love that with one Accord
[53:40] they spoke they were in such Unity that
[53:43] their prayer was as
[53:46] one all their voices together but their
[53:49] prayer was written down because they
[53:51] were in such Unity they were all praying
[53:53] the same thing Lord give us boldness
[53:57] oh my I pray that ought to be our prayer
[53:59] today Lord give us boldness to speak
[54:01] your word by stretching forth thine hand
[54:03] to heal and that signs and wonders may
[54:05] be done by the name of th holy Child
[54:07] Jesus and when they had prayed the place
[54:10] was shaken where they were assembled
[54:13] together and they were all someone say
[54:15] all they were all filled with the Holy
[54:18] Ghost and they spake the word of God
[54:21] with boldness I want to be able to
[54:23] preach with boldness and these other
[54:25] brothers that preach they want to be
[54:27] able to preach with boldness you want to
[54:29] be able to testify with boldness what's
[54:30] it going to take to do that you're going
[54:32] to have to get in one Accord and the
[54:34] Holy Ghost to fall so that he can refill
[54:36] us to speak with boldness again because
[54:39] sometimes we get tired and we get weary
[54:41] and we get to where we're afraid of Our
[54:42] Testimony but we need the boldness of
[54:44] the Holy
[54:46] Ghost yes sir we got to have that these
[54:50] are not optional matters it's important
[54:54] stuff yeah
[54:57] how many of us would want to see God do
[54:59] Miracles
[55:02] yes we want to see signs and want this
[55:04] participation
[55:06] night you want to see signs and wonder I
[55:08] do I'm not against signs and wonders I
[55:11] we don't follow signs and wonders but
[55:13] signs and wonders follow us I want to
[55:16] hear testimonies of healing and we we do
[55:18] and I'm glad of that but we want to we
[55:21] want to see more we want to see Miracles
[55:23] we want to see God move well if you want
[55:25] to see God move
[55:26] guess what look acts 5 and: 12 and by
[55:30] the hands of the apostles were many
[55:32] signs and wonders wrought among the
[55:34] people and they were all with one
[55:38] Accord you want to see signs and wonders
[55:42] come in one Accord they were all with
[55:44] one Accord in Solomon's porch and of the
[55:47] rest D no man join himself to them but
[55:50] the people magnifi them and Believers
[55:52] were the more added to the Lord
[55:53] multitudes of both men and women in so
[55:56] much they brought forth the sick into
[55:57] the streets I'd like to see that again I
[55:59] don't know about you but I'd like to see
[56:01] that again you say well will we see a a
[56:03] great Revival no but I believe among us
[56:06] we can see a Revival I believe right
[56:08] here in the church we can see God move
[56:11] ain't much Faith out there very many
[56:12] places but I believe there's Faith here
[56:15] and I believe we ought to strive for
[56:17] that you want that you know and and so
[56:20] the way to have it is not to be critical
[56:23] in fact that's the way to not have it
[56:25] the way to have it is to come in one
[56:28] Accord right so now he he said that that
[56:32] least the shadow they brought forth the
[56:33] sick in the streets laid them on beds
[56:35] and couches that at least the shadow of
[56:36] Peter passing by might overshadow some
[56:39] of them there came also in verse 16 a
[56:42] multitude out of the Cities round about
[56:44] unto Jerusalem bringing sick folk and
[56:46] them which were vexed with unclean
[56:48] spirits and they were healed
[56:52] everyone why they were in one Accord and
[56:54] if you go on down begin to read on down
[56:56] you find that they were arrested
[56:58] again so it didn't make the devil happy
[57:01] right the devil wasn't happy but they
[57:03] were in one
[57:05] Accord how many of you would like to see
[57:07] joy in the house of
[57:10] God right you didn't realize this was so
[57:12] important did
[57:14] you when we come to the house of God
[57:17] we've got to we've got to put our effort
[57:19] into we got to put our mind into we got
[57:21] to it's something we do we do on
[57:24] purpose right and so if you'd like to
[57:26] see Joy back in the house of God when
[57:28] Philip went to Samaria and preached
[57:30] Christ to them acts 85 acts 86 the
[57:33] people with one Accord with one Accord
[57:35] what did they do gave heed unto those
[57:38] things which philli spake
[57:41] sir they heard the word with one mind
[57:46] and when they heard the word that way
[57:49] they hearing and seeing the Miracles
[57:50] which he did for unclean spirits crying
[57:53] with loud voice come out of many that
[57:54] were possessed with them many take with
[57:56] pusies that were lame were healed and
[57:58] there was great joy in that
[58:01] City would you like to see Joy back in
[58:04] your home again would you like to see
[58:06] joy in the house of God again I say I
[58:08] say Amen to that I'd like to see Joy
[58:10] back in my own life and I've got joy but
[58:12] I want more joy don't you we got joy in
[58:15] the church we want more joy in the
[58:17] church we want to see God move how can
[58:19] we do that when we listen to the word
[58:21] with one
[58:22] Accord it brings Joy
[58:26] you want to see gifts operating in the
[58:30] church come on we do we want them in
[58:33] order but we want to see them
[58:35] operate we want God's gifts in the
[58:37] church listen what a prophet of God said
[58:40] now we're going to get into some quotes
[58:41] here brother brandham deals with this
[58:43] this week I I read over 500 quotes about
[58:47] this and just spent about eight hours
[58:50] just constant just reading and reading
[58:51] and reading and I put it all down and I
[58:54] got I got so
[58:56] I looked at it and I thought that's
[58:58] about seven hours right there so I just
[59:00] started taking stuff out taking stuff
[59:02] out taking stuff out cuz brother Bram
[59:03] talks about it all the time must have
[59:07] been a purpose in
[59:08] it God cannot give back the gifts to the
[59:12] church as long as his church is divided
[59:16] right we've got to get the church
[59:18] together first for the gifts can come
[59:21] right but if all the Full Gospel people
[59:23] would come one a heart and one ACC core
[59:25] there would be a Revival that would
[59:27] shake the whole world and every
[59:29] spiritual gift would be in the church
[59:31] listen to this listen to the power of
[59:34] coming in unity in the house of God yes
[59:37] he said in one hour's time within an
[59:40] hour's time yeah after it took
[59:47] place do we really believe
[59:50] that but see a lot of times it's not
[59:52] malevolence right it's not it's not that
[59:53] somebody's somebody sometimes it is but
[59:56] most of the time it's not most of the
[59:57] time it's just your mind
[59:59] drifts right M my mind
[1:00:02] drifts we get we get think about other
[1:00:04] things we get to look at other things we
[1:00:06] get busy during the week and we go to
[1:00:08] church like we pray sometimes and we
[1:00:10] just do it it's just it's just another
[1:00:14] service oh my but how much more could
[1:00:16] the preacher preach to to us if we would
[1:00:19] pray for the preacher if we'd be in one
[1:00:21] mind about that how much how much better
[1:00:23] would the song leader sing if we'd be in
[1:00:26] one mind of crying out to God and saying
[1:00:28] Lord we need a song service tonight we
[1:00:30] need God to move in the song service you
[1:00:32] believe he will I believe he does that
[1:00:34] how much better would the special singer
[1:00:36] sing if we if we prayed for him first if
[1:00:40] we took care to do that you said well do
[1:00:42] we need to have a special prayer you can
[1:00:43] pray while you're sitting here you can
[1:00:45] but you got to be in one mind about that
[1:00:48] yes sir that the service it doesn't it's
[1:00:52] you know that's the hardest thing when a
[1:00:53] military goes out you've got to have
[1:00:56] Unity of of purpose about what you're
[1:00:58] doing yeah because if you don't you
[1:01:00] can't ever win a war and we're in a
[1:01:02] battle Church we're fighting demons here
[1:01:05] tonight we're fighting Devils we're
[1:01:07] fighting the prince of the power of the
[1:01:08] air some of you are fighting sickness
[1:01:10] you're fighting discouragement you're
[1:01:12] fighting all kinds of different things
[1:01:13] and it's about time we come together
[1:01:15] with one purpose we're going to kill
[1:01:17] this devil we're going to get rid of him
[1:01:19] I don't want to see I don't want to see
[1:01:21] one person dragged out into the world I
[1:01:24] don't want to see one lost I want want
[1:01:26] to see everyone come to the house of God
[1:01:28] and come in one mind and one Accord yes
[1:01:31] are you with me so far yes Heen said
[1:01:35] every spiritual gift that would would be
[1:01:37] in the church within an hour's time
[1:01:38] after it took
[1:01:41] place that's
[1:01:43] powerful signs and wonders that was done
[1:01:45] by the apostles would be a minor thing
[1:01:49] to what would do if we could just get
[1:01:50] the church together right all
[1:01:54] right we got meetings coming up Church
[1:01:57] let's be in one Accord because it's hard
[1:01:59] to get 300 people in one Accord right
[1:02:02] but but let's be in one Accord let's be
[1:02:05] of one mind going into the meetings
[1:02:07] because we don't know who might be there
[1:02:08] that might need help we don't know who
[1:02:11] might be there who might be at the at
[1:02:13] the turning point of their life yes and
[1:02:16] it would make a difference if we were of
[1:02:17] one mind about the meetings
[1:02:21] right oh brother B said oh Christian
[1:02:24] people by find yourselves together with
[1:02:27] one heart and one Accord for God cannot
[1:02:32] no more send the gifts to the church the
[1:02:34] church is separated then he can send the
[1:02:36] Holy Ghost unless we're in one Accord
[1:02:40] other say you might you know we get lots
[1:02:42] of things that bother us I know for for
[1:02:44] many of you it's too cool in here in the
[1:02:46] summer and uh there's a reason why we
[1:02:48] keep it this cool because then it gets
[1:02:50] too hot if we don't and and so it's just
[1:02:51] one or the other and and people are too
[1:02:54] cold or too hot and I know that's a con
[1:02:56] thing in the church and and some people
[1:02:57] like the seats and some people don't
[1:02:59] like the seats and some people like the
[1:03:01] preacher and some people don't like the
[1:03:02] preacher and so every decision you make
[1:03:04] there's always going to be uh you know
[1:03:06] somebody that doesn't like it but but
[1:03:08] yet if we could just get past that I
[1:03:10] want to read you something you say
[1:03:11] brother Ben well if the temperature was
[1:03:13] right I I could really I could really
[1:03:16] worship listen to what brother BR says
[1:03:18] in this next quote he said he's talking
[1:03:21] about the day of Pentecost he said if it
[1:03:22] was hot there was such a Unity of spirit
[1:03:27] until they didn't even feel the
[1:03:32] heat I want to have church like
[1:03:36] that can you imagine so well I don't
[1:03:39] want to go to them meetings man all them
[1:03:40] people man that the building gets hot
[1:03:42] and the air might break down and but if
[1:03:44] it was hot there was such a Unity of
[1:03:47] spirit until they didn't even feel the
[1:03:49] heat he said now if we could just get
[1:03:52] that way wouldn't it be wonderful yes
[1:03:54] sir he said we wouldn't notice this heat
[1:03:56] all right now brother Harvey he didn't
[1:03:57] say we wouldn't notice the cold but we
[1:04:00] can kind of extrapolate that I
[1:04:04] guess right watch brother Brandon was
[1:04:07] constantly trying to get the people in
[1:04:08] one Accord why because he had a
[1:04:10] Supernatural
[1:04:12] Ministry he was a prophet of God he had
[1:04:15] a Supernatural Ministry and he knew that
[1:04:17] that gift as mighty as it was as great
[1:04:19] as it was couldn't operate like it
[1:04:21] should unless the people were in one
[1:04:24] Accord and I want you to see how much
[1:04:26] you have to do with the service you
[1:04:28] young people up here in the front you
[1:04:30] got a lot to do with the service you
[1:04:32] young ladies you got a lot to do with
[1:04:34] the service the way you come the
[1:04:35] attitude you come in the the way you
[1:04:37] view the preacher the way you view the
[1:04:40] song leader the way you the way you
[1:04:41] approach the service it it all matters
[1:04:44] for the service and so brother Brandon's
[1:04:47] always trying to get them in one Accord
[1:04:49] he said if he says this he said you know
[1:04:51] we're dealing with people who are sick
[1:04:53] he said he said if they cannot be
[1:04:54] touched by God they're going to die
[1:04:56] right away and your Disobedience might
[1:04:59] hinder their faith all
[1:05:01] right well Church you realize how
[1:05:04] serious it is so let's just all believe
[1:05:07] with one Accord now and let us say Lord
[1:05:10] Jesus I believe you he said and that'll
[1:05:12] make a a wall of Faith all the way
[1:05:14] around that's what I'd like to see here
[1:05:16] in the service tonight just a wall of
[1:05:18] Faith all the way around let it go all
[1:05:21] the way into the meeting that no devil
[1:05:22] could come in it just be a wall of Faith
[1:05:25] yes
[1:05:26] are you with me now make a wall of Faith
[1:05:29] all the way around brother brandham
[1:05:31] taught us and I don't have time to read
[1:05:33] all the quotes but you can go find them
[1:05:35] that the 30,000 that were saved at one
[1:05:37] time in his Africa campaign he said that
[1:05:40] was because they were of one mind in one
[1:05:42] Accord yeah Africans who had never heard
[1:05:45] the gospel right but they were of one in
[1:05:48] one Accord one mind in one place amen
[1:05:53] and he said that America needs
[1:05:54] missionaries
[1:05:56] yeah he said you go into a congregation
[1:05:59] this one says well he said No at night
[1:06:02] time even in this little handful of
[1:06:03] people he said you sit here and feel one
[1:06:05] coming here and here and here and here
[1:06:08] just everywhere people one in thinking
[1:06:11] this and one thinking that he said why I
[1:06:14] know what they're thinking about I am so
[1:06:16] glad I don't have that
[1:06:19] gift but I can read faces I've done this
[1:06:23] for 25 years I can read faces
[1:06:26] right I'm not bragging about that it's
[1:06:27] just I've been preaching since I was a
[1:06:28] kid I can read faces and so it it does
[1:06:32] it affects the preacher it affects the
[1:06:34] service right and so he he said he said
[1:06:38] I I know what they're thinking about
[1:06:39] sure I do God reveals it one of them
[1:06:41] saying well Dr so and so said it was
[1:06:43] mental telepathy this one says well he's
[1:06:45] a spiritualist and this one says it's a
[1:06:46] devil he said that's the reason the Holy
[1:06:48] Spirit can't move yeah he said you see
[1:06:51] it's got to be one Accord got to be one
[1:06:53] Accord and then God's blessings and
[1:06:54] Power will pour upon his people right
[1:06:58] listen if you had a man in the pulpit
[1:07:00] and I I I deny that I am that man I
[1:07:03] believe I'm a man of God or I wouldn't
[1:07:05] be here right I believe you're men and
[1:07:07] women of God but if you had a
[1:07:10] charlatan if you had a hypocrite
[1:07:13] standing in this
[1:07:14] Pulpit if you had a an attitude towards
[1:07:17] him that he was a charlott and and a
[1:07:19] hypocrite that's what you'd get out of
[1:07:21] it right but if he was even reading the
[1:07:24] Bible and he he said something out of
[1:07:26] the scripture CU that's God's word that
[1:07:28] was true and you had a positive attitude
[1:07:32] towards that word it could have as much
[1:07:35] effect on you as if he was a man of God
[1:07:38] right but the only thing keeping you
[1:07:41] from having that effect is keeping us
[1:07:43] from having that is our own
[1:07:45] attitudes all right are you with me now
[1:07:48] still with me you want to see God move I
[1:07:51] want to see him move let's get in one
[1:07:53] mind in one Accord brother brand when it
[1:07:55] would just get the faith would just get
[1:07:57] right he said it looks all milky all
[1:07:58] over the building why because the
[1:08:00] presence of God was there by Caleb and
[1:08:02] he could see that the people were all
[1:08:04] praying they were all calling out to God
[1:08:06] and there was a difference in the
[1:08:07] service go listen to the prayer lines in
[1:08:09] some places brother bam struggles he he
[1:08:12] he he rebukes the people he tries so
[1:08:13] hard no don't move around don't do this
[1:08:15] that or the other because they were just
[1:08:17] constantly doubting they were constantly
[1:08:19] doing those things and at other meetings
[1:08:20] it just seemed like it was on fire what
[1:08:22] was that it was when a group of people
[1:08:24] could come in one mind Accord and say
[1:08:26] this is the gift of God and we're going
[1:08:28] to Rally behind
[1:08:32] it so and this one he said this one says
[1:08:36] it's a devil that's the reason the Holy
[1:08:37] Spirit can't move he said it's got to be
[1:08:39] one Accord see he got to be one Accord
[1:08:41] and then God's blessings amen how many
[1:08:43] want His blessings His blessings and
[1:08:46] power will pour upon his people when
[1:08:49] we're in one
[1:08:50] Accord see we're in one Accord when we
[1:08:52] love one
[1:08:53] another right we love one another and lo
[1:08:56] doesn't mean when you love somebody you
[1:08:58] tend to overlook things when you don't
[1:09:01] love somebody you don't tend to overlook
[1:09:04] those things right right the problem is
[1:09:07] the lack of love the problem is not the
[1:09:09] things right and that happens in a
[1:09:11] marriage the problem is not that he uh
[1:09:13] he didn't do exactly what you wanted him
[1:09:15] to do for the hundredth time that's not
[1:09:16] the problem he used to overlook that
[1:09:19] same with the wife it's not that she
[1:09:20] didn't do exactly what you wanted to do
[1:09:22] a thousand times you used to overlook
[1:09:23] that what is it you grown cold
[1:09:26] right there's less love we ought to love
[1:09:28] one another right and when we love one
[1:09:31] another we come in one Accord brother
[1:09:33] Brown said the people in America had
[1:09:34] become indifferent towards God oh that's
[1:09:38] that's a quite a charge especially that
[1:09:40] long ago think what it is today they'
[1:09:43] become indifferent towards God he said
[1:09:45] and the reason we become so indifferent
[1:09:47] towards God is because we're indifferent
[1:09:49] towards one another see when we get in
[1:09:52] one Accord then God comes down see if
[1:09:55] you don't love one another and believe
[1:09:57] in one another you can never be in one
[1:09:59] Accord what do we talk about Sunday
[1:10:01] Abraham had to believe in something
[1:10:03] almost impossible and you've got to
[1:10:05] believe in your brothers and sisters you
[1:10:06] got to believe that they're going to be
[1:10:08] there one day you got to believe that
[1:10:10] and when you're taking communion
[1:10:12] together that one day you'll be there at
[1:10:14] the marriage supper and you there's got
[1:10:16] to be something in you that believes
[1:10:17] you'll see each other again and then it
[1:10:20] gets to where it's hard to leave the
[1:10:21] church cuz you want to Fellowship so bad
[1:10:24] you want to be around each other so bad
[1:10:26] brother BR said his church was that way
[1:10:27] early on and the people said come to him
[1:10:30] and said how did you get them all in one
[1:10:31] Accord how did you do that well he said
[1:10:35] it wasn't me he said they all got born
[1:10:37] again oh thank the Lord oh that's what
[1:10:40] we ought to that's the we we just need
[1:10:42] our maybe our minds need to be Washed by
[1:10:45] the Water of the word until we can come
[1:10:47] in one
[1:10:48] Accord amen said when we get in one
[1:10:52] Accord and God comes down what we need
[1:10:54] is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:55] atmosphere he said that's right an
[1:10:57] atmosphere where the power of God's are
[1:10:59] moving one Accord one place gathered
[1:11:01] together under that atmosphere of
[1:11:03] expecting God to move down and do signs
[1:11:06] and wonders listen if you expect me to
[1:11:08] make a mistake while preaching I
[1:11:10] will I promise you I will you'll get
[1:11:13] exactly that cuz I could find many
[1:11:16] mistakes you
[1:11:17] missed if you're looking for them I I
[1:11:19] can show you some but look oh my but but
[1:11:24] he's okay with and so I'm okay with it
[1:11:27] is that right like like I believe he I
[1:11:29] believe he's okay with me I I believe
[1:11:31] I'm born again I believe I'm Washed by
[1:11:33] the Water of the word and I believe you
[1:11:34] are too and so we're okay with one
[1:11:37] another right now look he he said say
[1:11:43] Lord he said I'm just believing say say
[1:11:46] Lord I'm just believing that you're
[1:11:47] going to pour your
[1:11:48] blessings how many times we come to
[1:11:50] church like that all right well it's
[1:11:52] Wednesday
[1:11:53] night huh
[1:11:55] but
[1:11:56] Lord I'm expecting you realize they'd
[1:12:00] already been 10 days in a row in that c
[1:12:02] in that hot upper
[1:12:03] room right they'd already put up with
[1:12:06] that for 10 days and not everybody
[1:12:09] stayed there were 500 people who watched
[1:12:13] Jesus literally watched him go up into
[1:12:15] the
[1:12:16] heavens and 380 of them found something
[1:12:19] better to
[1:12:20] do after 10 days but by the by the time
[1:12:24] Pentecost come the ones that were there
[1:12:26] were of one mind yes we shouldn't knock
[1:12:30] a Wednesday night
[1:12:32] service because maybe this would be the
[1:12:34] time we could come in one mind one
[1:12:36] Accord with one another look he said I'm
[1:12:41] expecting it now all things are moving
[1:12:43] right in I'm expecting to see the
[1:12:44] exceedingly abundantly now I'm expecting
[1:12:46] you come down and say well I don't know
[1:12:48] about it he said well see you hurt the
[1:12:51] other person so it's more than just us
[1:12:55] you come to church with an attitude of
[1:12:57] well here here it is again I'm going to
[1:12:58] get preached at again well that's what
[1:13:00] you hurt the other
[1:13:02] person right but what about the attitude
[1:13:04] of Lord help my pastor he he he he he's
[1:13:08] struggling he he he's got some things he
[1:13:10] has to do too but but he's struggling
[1:13:12] sometimes and and sometimes I do
[1:13:13] struggle but if we could only come in
[1:13:15] one mind one Accord and I'm not saying
[1:13:17] you just have to pray for me but
[1:13:18] everybody that stands behind the sacred
[1:13:20] desk and everybody this is a this is an
[1:13:23] awful place to stand in
[1:13:25] yeah do you realize that it's an awful
[1:13:28] place we're just a small group even when
[1:13:30] we're all together we're not a great
[1:13:31] group as far as in number but we're but
[1:13:35] we're the people of God you're you're
[1:13:36] the blood purchase of God I hold that in
[1:13:39] my hands and I realize what I say
[1:13:42] matters you think I don't feel that I do
[1:13:45] feel that but I I realize I've just got
[1:13:48] to do my best I I got to live I got to
[1:13:50] be a I got to be a human being and yet
[1:13:53] I've got to be a try to be a preacher
[1:13:56] and every one of these preachers it's an
[1:13:57] awful place to stand in and yet knowing
[1:13:59] that you everything you say people take
[1:14:01] one way or take the other but yet you've
[1:14:03] got to have the right attitude towards
[1:14:05] that and say Lord I'm expecting
[1:14:07] something to move tonight I'm expecting
[1:14:09] you to move I'm not looking at who's
[1:14:11] there and who's not there I'm expect the
[1:14:13] preacher got to have that expectation
[1:14:15] too I'm expecting you to move and when
[1:14:17] the preacher has that expectation and
[1:14:19] the people have that expectation God's
[1:14:21] got to do
[1:14:23] something are you with me now
[1:14:26] Oh my he said well he said now you're he
[1:14:28] said now you're sitting by one of them
[1:14:30] so in other words if you were in church
[1:14:32] you're sitting by somebody that has a
[1:14:33] bad attitude that he said you say oh
[1:14:36] Lord just tear him down now in other
[1:14:38] words just tear down those walls tear
[1:14:40] down that attitude I I'm I'm expecting
[1:14:43] great things he don't let it affect you
[1:14:46] he said and that expectancy will get
[1:14:48] that Unity among the people he said
[1:14:50] that's what happened on the day of
[1:14:52] Pentecost what brought the Holy Ghost in
[1:14:55] the first place yes see your attitude my
[1:14:58] attitude sets the atmosphere of the
[1:14:59] service yeah right they were blessing
[1:15:02] god brother B said that's what they were
[1:15:04] doing in the upper room he says that in
[1:15:05] several places they were blessing God
[1:15:07] for a promise in seed form many times
[1:15:10] the reason we don't have results is
[1:15:13] because we want to wait until the
[1:15:14] results get here to worship yeah right
[1:15:17] and what we worship is we worship in
[1:15:18] seed form right we have healing in seed
[1:15:21] form it's a promise we have salvation h
[1:15:25] full salvation the change of the body in
[1:15:27] seed form yeah right and and in seed
[1:15:30] form our expectations many times are in
[1:15:31] seed form but if we bless him in seed
[1:15:34] form he said they had the Holy Ghost as
[1:15:36] a promise and they blessed him for that
[1:15:39] promise they said Lord thank you for
[1:15:41] giving me the promise if we'd have that
[1:15:43] kind of attitude Lord thank you for
[1:15:44] giving me the promise of a good service
[1:15:46] thank you for giving me the promise of
[1:15:48] healing thank you for giving me the
[1:15:49] promise of my children we begin to bless
[1:15:51] him that way we'd see God begin to move
[1:15:54] that's what they were doing brother R
[1:15:56] said he was in a meeting like that in
[1:15:58] Wood River where the whole people just
[1:16:00] come in expectation he said they they
[1:16:02] just stacked up the the Wheelchairs and
[1:16:04] the crutches because the people come
[1:16:07] like that and so he talked about the law
[1:16:09] of God and how it brings results he said
[1:16:12] you irrigate by the law of gravity right
[1:16:15] he said you don't have a a pond full of
[1:16:17] water and a and a crop over here and you
[1:16:19] don't look at that water and say well I
[1:16:21] wish that water would get over here on
[1:16:23] my crop all right
[1:16:25] right that's not how that works what do
[1:16:27] you do you use gravity gravity is the
[1:16:30] law of God and you dig a trench or
[1:16:33] something that causes the water to go
[1:16:35] from over here to over where you need it
[1:16:37] right and so brother BR said you use the
[1:16:39] law of God to bring results he said well
[1:16:42] now look God is here this afternoon he
[1:16:44] said now we got to follow the law of God
[1:16:46] the law of God is one
[1:16:49] Accord right love one for the
[1:16:52] other so you realize when we're not in
[1:16:54] one record it becomes a self-fulfilling
[1:16:57] prophecy right that that we actually can
[1:17:00] hinder the service and then produce what
[1:17:01] we thought we were going to get a bad
[1:17:04] service yeah right Discord but if we'd
[1:17:08] come in one Accord right oh my look he
[1:17:12] said oh my there you are he said we got
[1:17:14] to follow the law of God the law of God
[1:17:15] is one Accord love one for the other oh
[1:17:17] my there you are one Accord everybody
[1:17:19] under expectations that God is going to
[1:17:21] pour down his
[1:17:22] power and he said he talked about the
[1:17:25] meeting said in these meetings you're
[1:17:26] laboring against
[1:17:27] everything the some of these were just
[1:17:29] remarkable I I left out many more
[1:17:32] remarkable quotes about this but we just
[1:17:34] don't have time he said here you are
[1:17:36] standing on the platform he said in a
[1:17:38] bank of spirits he said when you break
[1:17:41] into a Channel of spirit for a vision he
[1:17:44] said everybody praying some doubting
[1:17:47] some this way some that way and he
[1:17:49] talked about the man that Jesus led away
[1:17:51] from the city right and the man that
[1:17:53] Jesus leted away from the city remember
[1:17:55] he had to lead him away from the city
[1:17:57] and he put Clay on his eyes spit on the
[1:17:58] ground made clay put it on his eyes and
[1:18:00] told him to go wash but first he had to
[1:18:02] get him away from the city he talked
[1:18:04] about the girl who died and Jesus put
[1:18:06] out everyone but Peter James and John he
[1:18:10] didn't even let all his disciples go in
[1:18:13] yeah now think about it for a minute he
[1:18:15] couldn't even let his own disciples come
[1:18:17] in because not all of them would have
[1:18:19] believed but Peter James and John were
[1:18:21] Believers and so he brought them in and
[1:18:23] when he brought them in you can go read
[1:18:25] the the story in The Book of Mark I
[1:18:26] believe it is and brother Bram says this
[1:18:29] about that he said you got to have Unity
[1:18:30] Harmony everything in one Accord he said
[1:18:33] then the Holy Spirit should never have
[1:18:35] to have but one prayer here at the
[1:18:38] platform everything would take place
[1:18:41] just that would end
[1:18:42] it we could just be in one
[1:18:46] Accord now we can battle through right
[1:18:49] we're warriors that's what we're here
[1:18:50] for we battle through Spirits we battle
[1:18:53] through these things we battle through
[1:18:54] attitudes
[1:18:55] battle through our own attitudes battle
[1:18:56] through other people's attitudes right
[1:18:59] we do that we're warriors but how much
[1:19:01] better would it be if we showed
[1:19:03] up right I believe I'm talking to mature
[1:19:06] Christians tonight for the most part how
[1:19:08] much better would it be if you showed up
[1:19:11] if we showed up with that kind of
[1:19:12] attitude lord it's going to be a good
[1:19:14] service tonight
[1:19:17] yes now brother BR says you all keep in
[1:19:21] one Accord he said you got a battle of
[1:19:23] little unbelief
[1:19:25] leavs pitched around the
[1:19:28] wall tonight you imagine being a prophet
[1:19:31] being able to see all of that I just
[1:19:33] can't even comprehend it he said it's a
[1:19:35] battle of little unbelief pitched around
[1:19:39] the wall he said now I want you to have
[1:19:41] faith you see he said it's a hard battle
[1:19:44] all right all right he said if you just
[1:19:46] remember I'm trying to represent the
[1:19:49] Lord Jesus Christ to the people he said
[1:19:51] and it just keeps going from me you
[1:19:53] realize he was a prophet but yet he he
[1:19:55] would start to have a vision and this
[1:19:57] little unbelief over here and little
[1:19:58] unbelief over there and this battle of
[1:20:00] unbelief that's going on would cause it
[1:20:02] to leave him right and that's why he
[1:20:05] tell people don't get up and leave don't
[1:20:07] don't do that because because it affects
[1:20:09] me what was it he wanted he needed the
[1:20:11] people to come in one mind and one
[1:20:12] Accord looking with expectation for what
[1:20:15] God would
[1:20:16] do and many times we think well you know
[1:20:19] if we had a bigger crowd we could be in
[1:20:20] more in one Accord and actually that's
[1:20:22] not true right right some times during
[1:20:25] our meetings we do have a big crowd in
[1:20:26] one Accord and sometimes we have a big
[1:20:28] crowd in many
[1:20:31] Accords right Andy someone said that was
[1:20:34] the real miracle was the fact that they
[1:20:35] all got in a Honda but
[1:20:39] anyway but but but there you know
[1:20:41] sometimes you got people with all kinds
[1:20:43] of different ideas looking all kinds of
[1:20:45] different ways some come Skeptics some
[1:20:48] come different ways and yet God can
[1:20:50] still God still works but sometimes a
[1:20:53] smaller group is easy here to get in one
[1:20:56] Accord so that ought to take that excuse
[1:20:58] away that Wednesday night excuse away
[1:21:00] from us
[1:21:01] right right because sometimes a smaller
[1:21:04] groups easier to get in one mind M said
[1:21:07] God never comes in Great Gatherings
[1:21:10] because it's a great Gathering right
[1:21:12] right he don't look out there and say
[1:21:14] well there's 300 people there tonight
[1:21:15] boy I'm going to move
[1:21:17] tonight there's three people there
[1:21:19] tonight boy nothing that nothing I can
[1:21:21] do that's not what he said is it said
[1:21:23] we're two or three are gathered together
[1:21:26] there am I in the midst of them right
[1:21:29] but he said God doesn't come in Great
[1:21:30] Gatherings because it's a great
[1:21:31] Gathering he comes because the hearts
[1:21:34] are in one Accord and expecting him to
[1:21:37] come and it is true that the more people
[1:21:39] you can get together the more licks of
[1:21:41] fire you can get together that are in
[1:21:43] one Accord the better off you are right
[1:21:45] the better service you can have but
[1:21:48] sometimes you got to fight through that
[1:21:49] but listen here is a local church you
[1:21:51] understand visitors will come in and
[1:21:52] maybe that visitor probably won't be in
[1:21:54] Accord with us you they don't they don't
[1:21:56] know especially if they're not a
[1:21:57] Christian they they won't be in one mind
[1:21:59] in one Accord with us they may be bored
[1:22:01] they may be uh they they may be unhappy
[1:22:03] they may be they come here for some
[1:22:05] reason God sent them here now now what
[1:22:08] if we could be in one mind and one
[1:22:10] Accord and then that one person comes in
[1:22:12] you see how easy that battle is right
[1:22:14] all you got to waade through is that one
[1:22:16] spirit and if you can ever get to them
[1:22:18] maybe they could be
[1:22:19] changed right but if that one person
[1:22:21] comes in and sits on the back and I'm
[1:22:22] just and you're just waiting through
[1:22:24] spirit it's all the way through the
[1:22:25] congregation that's a problem yeah right
[1:22:28] because you never even get to the person
[1:22:29] that needed help right right so God does
[1:22:33] that he said look he comes because the
[1:22:34] hearts are in one Accord and expecting
[1:22:35] him to come look at Jesus to the
[1:22:37] humblest of church two or three are
[1:22:39] gathered in my name and and we come in
[1:22:42] one Accord and I I'm I'm rushing through
[1:22:45] this tonight and I wish I had that seven
[1:22:46] hours but I don't and I won't won't take
[1:22:48] it and I won't even take your time past
[1:22:51] what I normally do but they were in one
[1:22:53] Accord because they had one
[1:22:56] promise One
[1:22:58] Promise they were in an upper room all
[1:23:00] in one Accord he said not saying my
[1:23:02] church is better than yours I belong to
[1:23:04] this over here and our church has the
[1:23:05] best steeple they were all in one place
[1:23:08] cooperating in the Revival all in one
[1:23:11] Accord for they had the promise of
[1:23:14] something I I I believe that as message
[1:23:16] people we ought to come together when we
[1:23:18] have a meeting and and even in our local
[1:23:20] churches we're in one Accord with all
[1:23:22] the other message churches on what we
[1:23:24] believe a Rapture is coming we got a
[1:23:26] promise of a Rapture let's be in one
[1:23:28] Accord on
[1:23:31] that anybody that believes in the
[1:23:33] Rapture of the church let's be in one
[1:23:35] Accord on that we got to agree on
[1:23:38] something but brother Brandon said the
[1:23:40] American people had a difficult time
[1:23:41] coming into that Unity into one Accord
[1:23:44] he said oh my American brothers and
[1:23:46] sisters don't lay in this lull that you
[1:23:49] American people are laying in he said
[1:23:51] why in India let that happen he said let
[1:23:53] happen what just happened now every
[1:23:56] person on the grounds would get up and
[1:23:57] walk
[1:23:58] away he just discerned the secrets of
[1:24:01] the heart and this person the Lord had
[1:24:03] God had used brother brandom to do that
[1:24:05] brother brandom said if if that happened
[1:24:07] in India he said every person on the
[1:24:09] ground get up and walk away why they be
[1:24:11] healed right tens of thousands would be
[1:24:14] healed at one time yeah that's right he
[1:24:16] said but we well we wonder we're so
[1:24:18] educated we're so smart he said it's too
[1:24:20] bad I don't mean maybe you people here
[1:24:22] but that Spirit of America he said we
[1:24:23] know it all
[1:24:24] we know all about it a know-it-all
[1:24:27] religious spirit is a terrible demon
[1:24:30] it's harder to get rid of than a than a
[1:24:32] smoking habit hard to get because it's
[1:24:34] pretty easy to look at a smoking habit
[1:24:35] and say that's wrong it's hard to
[1:24:37] convince a person with a religious
[1:24:39] spirit that they got a problem right
[1:24:41] it's a terrible devil and and brother
[1:24:43] brandham says that he said oh and that's
[1:24:45] that's America everybody's religious
[1:24:47] they might be smoking be Rel drinking be
[1:24:49] religious but he said oh if you could
[1:24:51] just get out of that crust let your
[1:24:53] heart get smooth and tender before God
[1:24:56] you could realize your poor humble
[1:24:58] brother has nothing to do with this or
[1:25:00] if we could just get away from that he
[1:25:02] said if you could only see what I see he
[1:25:05] said that cold indifferent foggy look
[1:25:08] hanging
[1:25:09] around come on church that's not all
[1:25:12] just how hard we work I know we work
[1:25:14] hard but it's the spirit of the age we
[1:25:17] got to fight
[1:25:18] that we got to fight that you got to
[1:25:21] grab your sword pick it up with me I I'm
[1:25:24] do doing I'm asking somebody to come
[1:25:25] with me brother Brand It just strikes me
[1:25:28] so hard when he preached with why little
[1:25:29] bethle H he said oh he said I'm standing
[1:25:31] in a terrible place he said you you
[1:25:33] ministers he said somebody come stand
[1:25:35] with me and stand for the word of God
[1:25:38] stand for the power of God he said give
[1:25:40] God a drink of Pentecostal water oh I
[1:25:43] wonder tonight if we could do that just
[1:25:44] looking for somebody to stand with me
[1:25:46] and say let's fight this devil of
[1:25:48] coldness let's fight the apathy let's
[1:25:50] fight the lukewarmness let's go forward
[1:25:52] in God
[1:25:57] somebody stand with me don't if if you
[1:26:00] believe in what I believe and and what
[1:26:02] do I believe the message if you believe
[1:26:03] the message of the hour let's stand in
[1:26:05] unity today
[1:26:08] yes believe we're going to be sit on the
[1:26:11] throne one
[1:26:12] day
[1:26:14] together huh the brand said if we get
[1:26:18] away from that indifferent foggy look
[1:26:19] hanging around trying that's what making
[1:26:20] you feel he said just can't raise up and
[1:26:22] accept it all at once it's because that
[1:26:23] hangs over you said if I could ever get
[1:26:26] that
[1:26:27] broke all right I I've watched many
[1:26:30] times I sometimes I can tell when
[1:26:33] something I don't know about your life
[1:26:35] is spoken over your life and and
[1:26:37] something happens in your and it happens
[1:26:39] more often than people realize where
[1:26:41] somebody will I don't stand up here and
[1:26:43] talk about it but I'll preach something
[1:26:44] and somebody will say that was just
[1:26:45] right down my alley and you can see it
[1:26:48] when it happens because you see their
[1:26:50] face change you see their attitude
[1:26:52] change because they realize oh oh he you
[1:26:54] know this but if there's that foggy
[1:26:56] coldness about them and if there's that
[1:26:58] that that bitterness or that grudge
[1:27:00] against somebody they just can't receive
[1:27:02] it and I'll watch it and it'll go out
[1:27:04] but they'll never receive it and it may
[1:27:06] be just as real and just as much for
[1:27:08] them but it's the receiver you know you
[1:27:11] got to if you're not getting a radio
[1:27:13] signal it's either the the radio station
[1:27:15] or the receiver one or the other and
[1:27:18] I'll say this the radio station is the
[1:27:20] Holy Ghost you believe the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:23] is is right you believe operates
[1:27:24] correctly then it must be the
[1:27:28] receiver right and either my receiver
[1:27:31] your receivers you know what so we have
[1:27:33] to come with that attitude now he said
[1:27:35] have faith now if I could ever get that
[1:27:38] broke if I ever get the people just in
[1:27:39] one Accord what would take place he said
[1:27:40] well I've seen it he said have faith now
[1:27:42] we oughtn't to have to bring anyone else
[1:27:45] in other words he it wasn't a show he
[1:27:47] shouldn't have to bring people up there
[1:27:48] Time After Time After Time about kill
[1:27:49] himself one time should have done it and
[1:27:51] they should have believed and so places
[1:27:54] that happened but we you say well if it
[1:27:57] was really of God unbelief wouldn't
[1:27:58] hinder it Matthew 13:58 he did not many
[1:28:01] mighty works there because of their
[1:28:04] unbelief I don't want that to be written
[1:28:06] about me I don't want that to be written
[1:28:09] about our church they did not many
[1:28:11] mighty works because of unbelief I want
[1:28:13] to I believe you're Believers tonight
[1:28:15] and I trust that we can all come in one
[1:28:17] mind and one Accord well the B says it's
[1:28:20] the attitude of the people that brings
[1:28:21] the results that's the reason that
[1:28:23] Pentecost they had to go go in Upper
[1:28:24] Room pray until the Holy Ghost came cuz
[1:28:26] they got in one place in one Accord it's
[1:28:28] the atmosphere that brings the results
[1:28:30] he said you believe that yeah you
[1:28:32] believe
[1:28:33] that you know how hard it is this is
[1:28:36] true when you ask for a show of hands on
[1:28:38] something you know how much of the
[1:28:40] audience is with you based on how many
[1:28:42] respond and I know some people never
[1:28:44] want to respond to anything right and uh
[1:28:47] there's some people who sat in church
[1:28:48] for years and never acknowledge they
[1:28:50] were saved you know but but it's okay to
[1:28:53] respond yes sir
[1:28:54] because it shows
[1:28:56] Unity right and so when you when you ask
[1:28:58] for a response and sometimes you'll ask
[1:29:00] for a response how many glad to be here
[1:29:01] tonight and you know
[1:29:03] just I got people raising their hands
[1:29:05] but personal say that how many glad to
[1:29:07] be here brother Allan knows this brother
[1:29:08] Joel knows this and Caleb keeps raising
[1:29:10] his hand
[1:29:13] they you're gonna make me laugh and I
[1:29:15] won't be able to preach but they'll say
[1:29:17] that and how many you glad to be here
[1:29:18] and and nobody raised their hands you
[1:29:21] know how that it's like well what do we
[1:29:23] do
[1:29:25] Where Do We Go From
[1:29:27] Here yes right sometimes brother Joel
[1:29:31] say and I know it's just a habit you
[1:29:32] know you say things you know he'll say
[1:29:33] how many are ready for the word
[1:29:34] everybody
[1:29:36] just well I'm not rebuking you but you
[1:29:40] see what a difference it makes what if
[1:29:42] we could say Amen maybe that's all you
[1:29:44] could get Jason you maybe just say Amen
[1:29:47] it's real quietly you know amen if you
[1:29:50] just say that that would make a
[1:29:51] difference in the
[1:29:52] service I made just see your mouth the
[1:29:54] words I may not even hear it but it
[1:29:56] might encourage me right it might
[1:29:58] encourage brother Joel might encourage
[1:30:00] brother Allen or somebody else brother
[1:30:01] Andrew when he stands here these are
[1:30:03] these are men of God coming in the
[1:30:05] meeting I believe that brother wend
[1:30:07] brother Allan brother Shawn and brother
[1:30:08] Daryl Ward and we've seen God mooving
[1:30:10] these men's Ministries I know that
[1:30:12] they're men of God and yet but we have
[1:30:15] to have a response a quick response how
[1:30:17] can we do that by coming with the right
[1:30:18] mind and what one Accord are you all
[1:30:21] still loving me tonight
[1:30:22] [Laughter]
[1:30:26] many of you do
[1:30:29] what what creates an atmosphere I got to
[1:30:32] get out of
[1:30:33] this our faith does yes right brother BR
[1:30:37] said now you've got to create an
[1:30:40] atmosphere I skipped past one or two but
[1:30:43] he said you got to create an atmosphere
[1:30:45] and your faith will do it he said they
[1:30:46] were all in the upper room with one
[1:30:47] Accord when suddenly they're come from
[1:30:49] Heaven as a sound of a rushing Mighty
[1:30:52] Wind the atmosphere was right yeah he
[1:30:55] said it takes an atmosphere to do
[1:30:56] anything he said let this little handful
[1:30:58] of people sitting here tonight get in
[1:31:00] the perfect atmosphere watch what takes
[1:31:02] place there will not be a feeble one in
[1:31:04] our midst so I pray God would do it
[1:31:06] tonight the cripples will walk the blind
[1:31:08] will see the deaf will hear the dumb
[1:31:10] will speak without prayer or anything
[1:31:13] it's the atmosphere yeah he said that's
[1:31:15] how 25,000 was healed at one prayer in
[1:31:17] Africa when they seen the Lord do
[1:31:19] something it created an atmosphere and
[1:31:21] they stepped into it oh church we don't
[1:31:23] do he said that's the pool when the
[1:31:25] waters is running right what's he
[1:31:27] talking about the pool of Bethesda when
[1:31:29] the waters were stirred step into it you
[1:31:32] got to step into it and when you step
[1:31:34] into it God can
[1:31:36] move now each one of us brother BR says
[1:31:39] is a
[1:31:40] Dynam right a Dynamo I had to look that
[1:31:44] up what a Dynamo was brother Harold's
[1:31:48] smiling at me cuz but he knows what that
[1:31:49] is but a Dynamo and a Dynamo is a
[1:31:52] generator right like pretty kind of
[1:31:55] y'all can correct me
[1:31:56] later but you think about it like this
[1:31:58] it's a unit that produces
[1:32:01] power right each one of us produce
[1:32:03] something positive energy negative
[1:32:06] energy Faith
[1:32:08] unbelief right we're just sitting there
[1:32:10] generating you can't turn it
[1:32:13] off right you can't be neutral it's just
[1:32:16] all the
[1:32:17] time right just a Dynamo now we could
[1:32:20] take these air units isn't that
[1:32:21] wonderful that we got cool air in the
[1:32:23] church isn't that wonderful praise
[1:32:25] God but but you look at the at those air
[1:32:28] units and if we put two of those on heat
[1:32:30] and one of them on cool you'd notice the
[1:32:34] difference cuz the one it the two would
[1:32:37] affect the one it would have a very
[1:32:40] difficult time keeping it on and even if
[1:32:43] you put one on heat it it would it would
[1:32:45] change the temperature it would change
[1:32:47] how hard these others have to work uh
[1:32:49] when we did the fellowship H the other
[1:32:51] day the AC man told me he said you know
[1:32:53] I said 'well this other one said it had
[1:32:55] a code on it that you need to check it
[1:32:57] he said' that's just cuz it was working
[1:32:58] so hard right that's why sometimes we
[1:33:01] get error codes you know we're just
[1:33:03] working so hard and and we're working
[1:33:05] all by ourselves but that middle one
[1:33:07] that middle air conditioning unit had a
[1:33:09] mouse crawled in it and so it wouldn't
[1:33:12] the the the uh the thing wouldn't Spin
[1:33:15] The Fan wouldn't Spin and that's all it
[1:33:16] was man just reached up here took the
[1:33:18] mouse out put it up there and then
[1:33:19] probably send us the
[1:33:21] bill but but that's all that's all it
[1:33:23] took was take the mouse
[1:33:26] out maybe we just need to get the mouse
[1:33:28] out of our
[1:33:31] Lives come on
[1:33:33] Church brother BR said every person is a
[1:33:36] spirit every one of you got a soul when
[1:33:38] you go to believe in it's in that
[1:33:40] channel of Faith he said you believe
[1:33:42] that certainly and if you get with one
[1:33:44] Accord that's when the Holy Spirit will
[1:33:46] just move in yes amen he said if you'll
[1:33:49] just all forsake your thoughts for a
[1:33:50] little bit just get in one Accord oh if
[1:33:52] you'll just let every heart beat the
[1:33:53] same towards Christ tonight you'll see
[1:33:55] exceedingly abundantly he said now
[1:33:57] remember that Feast on the word believe
[1:33:59] with all your heart enter into it get
[1:34:02] into the service get into the worship
[1:34:04] don't be ashamed just in your heart he
[1:34:06] said I don't mean you have to scream if
[1:34:07] you feel like screaming that's up to you
[1:34:10] that doesn't profit too much but if
[1:34:11] you'll just get into the worship of it
[1:34:13] oh Jesus how lovely you really are I
[1:34:16] never knew you so sweet he said that's
[1:34:18] when you get into it that's when God
[1:34:19] comes down pours His blessings right
[1:34:21] over everywhere said that's when
[1:34:24] something happens listen we should want
[1:34:26] our attitudes every service our
[1:34:28] atmosphere to be right for the sake of
[1:34:30] others right now if if we don't need
[1:34:32] anything say I don't need anything well
[1:34:33] for the sake of somebody else for the
[1:34:35] sake of God's people for the for the
[1:34:37] sake of these children let's Let It Be
[1:34:40] Right the said God wants somebody can
[1:34:43] hold in his hands he talks about how
[1:34:44] that they can I can send my sick servant
[1:34:46] to the brandom Tabernacle and that group
[1:34:48] of people are one Accord something will
[1:34:49] happen he said well look what he does
[1:34:51] for us in the condition that we're in he
[1:34:54] said what would he do if we were one
[1:34:55] heart and one Accord look what he does
[1:34:57] for us anyway by Grace he provides what
[1:34:59] would he do if we were in one heart and
[1:35:02] one Accord he said the only way we can
[1:35:04] do that listen you want to know how to
[1:35:06] do it tonight the only way we can do
[1:35:09] that is unify our hearts together with
[1:35:12] Brotherly
[1:35:13] Love uh
[1:35:16] oh I don't know if that says what it I
[1:35:19] don't know if I saw that
[1:35:21] one obey the officers of the church
[1:35:24] Church the pastor and the pastor obey
[1:35:28] God pastors got to be obedient too right
[1:35:32] he said that's the only way to come in
[1:35:33] one mind and one
[1:35:36] Accord oh church we don't realize
[1:35:39] sometimes what we do and we just sitting
[1:35:41] there and we just well I've had a bad
[1:35:43] day and he preached too long if we could
[1:35:45] just get in one
[1:35:47] Accord that's good yes listen he said
[1:35:50] then God works to the pastor through the
[1:35:52] board down into the Church all together
[1:35:54] one unit to the kingdom of God then God
[1:35:57] will hear when we have a unified group
[1:36:00] he said let nothing bother you don't be
[1:36:02] dismayed at anything he said no that's
[1:36:05] the kind of person God ordained to take
[1:36:06] the land Moses was complete he was a man
[1:36:10] that wouldn't compromise if there were
[1:36:12] stews and fusses and so forth he
[1:36:15] wouldn't compromise that's what God
[1:36:16] wants us now why because he knew he he
[1:36:19] had to take everyone into the presence
[1:36:21] of God remember he said pharaoh wanted
[1:36:23] to agree he said Moses you all can go
[1:36:25] but you leave your children behind or
[1:36:26] leave some of your cattle back here he
[1:36:28] said that's the way the devil wants a
[1:36:29] Christian to come it'll be all right for
[1:36:31] you to join the church but don't you
[1:36:32] never forgive
[1:36:35] Jones you don't have to give up you're
[1:36:37] smoking you're drinking you're lying
[1:36:39] you're stealing your fault finding
[1:36:41] backbiting you don't have to give that
[1:36:42] up just join the church but Moses wasn't
[1:36:44] a compromiser he wanted complete
[1:36:46] deliverance he said we'll not leave one
[1:36:49] hoof behind we'll take everything that
[1:36:51] belongs to us when we go to Worship the
[1:36:54] Lord oh that we could come to the house
[1:36:56] of God like that we would not compromise
[1:36:59] on one uh one bad thought or one thought
[1:37:01] there was outside the word of God we
[1:37:03] would cast down everything that exalted
[1:37:05] itself against the word he said that's
[1:37:08] the way the church ought to be he said
[1:37:10] we'll take righteousness we'll take
[1:37:11] Holiness we'll take the Holy Spirit
[1:37:13] we'll take a unified group when we go to
[1:37:15] the altar we'll be a real group we'll
[1:37:17] leave nothing behind we'll take
[1:37:19] everything someone say everything we'll
[1:37:22] take everything there won't be one who
[1:37:24] stay back here he said you know when
[1:37:26] people can pray in such a way till the
[1:37:27] devil will have to give
[1:37:30] in than the Lord where are we sitting
[1:37:34] we're sitting in Heavenly
[1:37:36] places he said he hath hath past tense
[1:37:40] raised us up together together and made
[1:37:43] us sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:37:46] Christ Jesus church squabbles isn't
[1:37:49] Heavenly
[1:37:50] places fussing and fighting isn't a
[1:37:52] Heavenly place
[1:37:55] right our homes ought to be a Heavenly
[1:37:57] place our churches ought to be a
[1:37:59] Heavenly Place Heavenly places he said
[1:38:03] now just not out anywhere but in
[1:38:04] Heavenly places we're Syble that means
[1:38:06] the position of the believer and if I'm
[1:38:08] prayed up and you're prayed up the
[1:38:09] church has prayed up we've assembled
[1:38:11] ourselves we're ready for the message

[1:38:28] position in Christ all sins under the
[1:38:31] blood in perfect worship with our hands
[1:38:33] up to God our hearts lifted sitting in
[1:38:35] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:38:37] worshiping together in Heavenly
[1:38:41] places brother BR says this I'll read
[1:38:44] this one and I'm going to close I've got
[1:38:46] quite a bit more but I'll just read
[1:38:49] this brother Brandon said we are very
[1:38:51] happy and so thankful to God for his
[1:38:52] goodness and mercy Mercy he said you
[1:38:54] people giving your spirit over to him in
[1:38:58] cooperation did you ever think about
[1:38:59] coming to church like that you give your
[1:39:02] spirit over to Christ in
[1:39:04] cooperation so that he can lead us and
[1:39:06] guide us he said see if you've got a
[1:39:09] resenting audience the Holy Spirit won't
[1:39:13] even
[1:39:14] reveal you say why why why can't the
[1:39:16] preacher preach Revelation to
[1:39:19] me come on church I don't believe you're
[1:39:21] a resenting audience but we don't want
[1:39:23] to ever get that way God won't reveal
[1:39:26] himself to a resenting audience he said
[1:39:29] you got to have something that working
[1:39:31] together in one place in one Accord then
[1:39:33] there come a sound from Heaven
[1:39:35] rushing he said no matter how much I'd
[1:39:37] pray and lay down lay day and night
[1:39:39] studying and praying before the Lord
[1:39:40] walk down here maybe the anointing on me
[1:39:43] walk up here and feel that resentment
[1:39:44] see he said it just Grieves him right
[1:39:46] away he won't reveal nothing but when
[1:39:50] you walk down here under the anointing
[1:39:52] and feel your audience under the
[1:39:54] anointing that's when the Holy Spirit
[1:39:57] begins to work then and it begins to
[1:39:59] move and do great things for
[1:40:02] us amen amen we're in one Accord by the
[1:40:06] Holy Ghost do you believe that
[1:40:09] today brother brandham says this
[1:40:12] musicians go ahead and
[1:40:14] come he said as the days grow closer and
[1:40:17] closer I'm sorry brother Robert I'm
[1:40:18] skipping and the narrowing of the path
[1:40:20] we want to go closer together
[1:40:23] we we must just be one body we must just
[1:40:26] move together forgetting one another's
[1:40:31] sins and our
[1:40:33] differences and just sticking closer and
[1:40:37] closer and closer as we see that day
[1:40:40] approaching you know we got to give God
[1:40:41] some credit
[1:40:44] sometimes you just give him some credit
[1:40:47] God I know you called the pastor you
[1:40:48] called the preacher I'm just going to
[1:40:50] give you the credit that you knew what
[1:40:51] you were doing I can't see it but you
[1:40:53] know I wouldn't have called him but I'm
[1:40:55] going to give you some credit God I'm
[1:40:57] going to take my hands off this and let
[1:40:59] you let you work through your man let
[1:41:02] you work through my husband my wife my
[1:41:03] brother my
[1:41:05] sister assemble yourselves together
[1:41:08] forget one another's sins our
[1:41:09] differences just sticking closer and
[1:41:11] closer and closer as we see that day
[1:41:13] approaching assembling ourselves
[1:41:15] together all with one Accord and one
[1:41:17] heart and if a brother sister gets out
[1:41:19] of the way in any way don't do nothing
[1:41:21] but pray for that person in love always
[1:41:23] considering one another don't never let
[1:41:26] one of you get away that's my desire I
[1:41:30] don't want to I've had to say things
[1:41:32] before and had to take a stand and
[1:41:33] people leave and I don't want to do that
[1:41:36] that's not my heart I don't want to but
[1:41:39] I've got to my job as a pastor is to
[1:41:41] protect the Sheep you realize my job as
[1:41:44] a pastor as my pastoral role as a
[1:41:47] minister I want to win souls my job as a
[1:41:49] pastor is to protect the
[1:41:51] Sheep that's what he called me to do
[1:41:53] that's number one job number one protect
[1:41:56] the sheep and I can't wait on something
[1:41:59] bad to happen to to protect sheep
[1:42:01] because y'all could do that y'all could
[1:42:03] react to situations but God gives a
[1:42:06] pastor to be able to see it coming right
[1:42:09] that's what that's the whole purpose so
[1:42:11] you've got to have a you got to you got
[1:42:14] to let the pastor do that right you got
[1:42:17] to let them do that you got to let the
[1:42:19] brother and sister do that that God I
[1:42:20] don't realize I don't it may not make
[1:42:22] any sense to me but God you do that but
[1:42:24] I don't want to see one person get away
[1:42:27] I want to see everybody worshiping
[1:42:29] together I'm all for it yes I've thought
[1:42:32] before what a wonderful time it would be
[1:42:34] if we just all worship together we get
[1:42:36] in these meetings a little bit of taste
[1:42:37] of that right and we don't agree with
[1:42:39] everybody that comes in here right we
[1:42:42] don't agree with every preacher and
[1:42:43] everything but we agree on the big stuff
[1:42:46] we agree that God sent a prophet we
[1:42:48] agree that the message of the hour is
[1:42:50] right we agree that the the blood was
[1:42:51] spilled on the cross for our s right we
[1:42:55] agree but you realize when you get in
[1:42:58] the way of God and his method of working
[1:43:00] in things that you actually you actually
[1:43:03] cause you affect other people and I
[1:43:06] affect other people we we just want to
[1:43:07] stay in the in the right mode and stay
[1:43:09] in one Accord don't we don't we want to
[1:43:11] do that love one another never let one
[1:43:14] of you get away stay
[1:43:16] together now look if somebody you see
[1:43:19] somebody not in church it's not you know
[1:43:21] I do I always I try to call call
[1:43:23] somebody or talk to them I'll give them
[1:43:24] a little time you see somebody say
[1:43:26] hanging out of church I'll go talk to
[1:43:28] them my wife does the same thing without
[1:43:29] me asking her to she'll go and text them
[1:43:32] call them try to see where where they've
[1:43:33] been and I'll do the same thing what
[1:43:35] what are we doing we don't want to see
[1:43:36] one get away we're not indiff to that
[1:43:40] but but you want people to want to be in
[1:43:42] the house of God I'm not going to stand
[1:43:43] up here and preach at you every time
[1:43:44] about coming to church I just want this
[1:43:47] to be such a Powerhouse of God's spirit
[1:43:50] that people would be so so upset if they
[1:43:53] missed the
[1:43:54] service because it was so much fun to be
[1:43:57] in the house of God you say could that
[1:43:59] be that way yes it was just so much
[1:44:02] there was so much power so much word
[1:44:04] preached there was so much it was just
[1:44:06] so good to be in the presence of God
[1:44:08] that we just wanted to be there that's
[1:44:10] the way we want it to be but he said if
[1:44:13] you can he said stay together and if you
[1:44:16] can add more to it
[1:44:18] constantly empty pews never inspired
[1:44:21] anybody if you can more to it all the
[1:44:24] time but stay together don't let anybody
[1:44:27] get away we're going to take all of them
[1:44:29] we don't want one hoof Left
[1:44:34] Behind brother brand said when the those
[1:44:37] Africans were in one mind one Accord and
[1:44:40] he said the the ladies he didn't have to
[1:44:43] preach to them about dress but they
[1:44:45] covered themselves they were naked they
[1:44:48] covered themselves though they never
[1:44:51] heard it preach because they got born
[1:44:53] again and because they were in one mind
[1:44:56] one
[1:44:57] Accord and brother brand tells a story
[1:44:59] about them singing together and and
[1:45:02] congregational singing is just that
[1:45:04] we're we're supposed to lift our voices
[1:45:06] together and brother B talks about the
[1:45:09] Africans singing together he said and
[1:45:11] they sung Heavenly sunshine I think was
[1:45:13] the song he said and when they sung
[1:45:16] together he said brother bosor said I've
[1:45:17] trained choirs he said but I watched him
[1:45:20] Afric singing in different languages he
[1:45:23] said but they were all in the same key
[1:45:26] they were all he said singing the same
[1:45:27] octave the same
[1:45:29] pitch why they were in one Accord they
[1:45:32] were there for one purpose a little
[1:45:34] while before that they were Waring with
[1:45:35] one another picking up clubs and Spears
[1:45:38] and fighting with one another like
[1:45:39] people do in
[1:45:40] churches they were fussing and fighting
[1:45:43] and and killing one another and they
[1:45:45] come together in the meetings they sang
[1:45:46] to brother brandom and brother Bosworth
[1:45:48] and he said it he said it was just like
[1:45:50] an Angelic choir no other mus music like
[1:45:53] that I wonder it made him feel good cuz
[1:45:56] he saw they were together I wonder how
[1:45:58] God feels when he hears his children
[1:46:00] begin to worship it may not be a bunch
[1:46:03] of them it may be just Paul and Silas in
[1:46:05] the jail cell but they begin to lift
[1:46:07] their hands to him and say Lord I love
[1:46:10] you I I thank you for saving me thank
[1:46:13] you for keeping me thank you for being
[1:46:16] who you are and when he hears it he
[1:46:18] hears two voices in unison all of a
[1:46:20] sudden he hears three he hears four he
[1:46:22] hears five what that must mean to him
[1:46:25] because his heart longs to see that
[1:46:27] that's why he moves when he sees one
[1:46:29] heart and one Accord you want to move
[1:46:31] the mind of God you want to you want to
[1:46:33] see him move in our services come in one
[1:46:36] mind forget all your differences and let
[1:46:38] God move among us could we do that
[1:46:40] tonight let's just stand together oh my
[1:46:44] oh I want to see God move don't you I
[1:46:47] don't want to see a service go by and it
[1:46:49] just be we went through the motions I
[1:46:51] want to see God move every time so let's
[1:46:53] just lift our hands to him if we could
[1:46:55] and just worship him for a moment oh
[1:46:57] Heavenly Father we love you we thank you
[1:47:00] oh God for being who you are we thank
