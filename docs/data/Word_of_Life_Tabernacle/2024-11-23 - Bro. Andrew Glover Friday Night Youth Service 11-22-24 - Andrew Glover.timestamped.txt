[49:51] John the 6th chapter we want to look in
[49:54] the 66th verse of St John and then we're
[49:57] going to go to 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[50:00] amen we do want to say it is an honor
[50:01] tonight to have brother Thomas cross
[50:03] here with us from over in North Carolina
[50:05] we was out there ministering this week
[50:07] and brother Thomas just jumped in and
[50:08] came out with us to be a part of these
[50:10] meetings and so we sure appreciate him
[50:12] coming and being here and amen I I do do
[50:15] appreciate these young men that are
[50:16] carrying this gospel the Lord just C
[50:18] recently called brother Thomas into the
[50:20] ministry and so we sure appreciate him
[50:22] and his stand for this word and the Book
[50:24] of St John the 6th chapter and in the
[50:27] 66th verse you love the Lord tonight
[50:31] amen St John chapter 6 and verse
[50:34] 66 from that time many of his disciples
[50:37] went back and walked with him no more
[50:41] then said Jesus unto the 12 will ye also
[50:44] go away and then Simon Peter answered
[50:47] him Lord to whom shall we go now brother
[50:51] Ram took time to identify that Peter did
[50:54] not say where would we go he he said but
[50:57] to whom shall we go brother B said see
[51:00] it's not about a place it's about a
[51:02] person for thou Hast the words of
[51:05] eternal life so Peter identified that he
[51:08] was the one who had the words of eternal
[51:11] life and we believe and are sure that
[51:14] thou art that Christ the son of the
[51:17] Living God now there was no hesitation
[51:20] or reservation in their Declaration of
[51:22] what they believed they were sure and
[51:24] they were confident that Jesus was the
[51:27] Christ and he was the son of the Living
[51:30] God now in in 2 Corinthians chapter
[51:33] 5 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[51:37] number 16 it's a very very familiar
[51:40] reading here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[51:42] and verse number 16 amen Paul here
[51:46] writing he says now wherefore henceforth
[51:50] know we know man after the flesh yay
[51:52] though we have known Christ after the
[51:54] flesh yet now him forth know we him no
[51:58] more now therefore If any man be in
[52:01] Christ he is a new creature now there is
[52:05] that not place but person therefore If
[52:08] any man be in Christ he is a new
[52:10] creature old things are passed away and
[52:14] behold some things are become new a few
[52:17] things no Paul says all things are
[52:20] become new watch and all things are of
[52:23] God who hath reconciled us to him
[52:26] himself by Jesus Christ look and hath
[52:29] given to us the ministry of
[52:33] reconciliation look at verse 19 to Wi
[52:35] that God was in Christ how many believes
[52:38] it all that was in God he poured into
[52:40] Christ to Wi that God was in Christ
[52:43] reconciling the world unto himself not
[52:46] imputing their trespasses unto them now
[52:48] watch and hath committed unto us the
[52:52] word somebody say the word the word of
[52:55] reconciliation so all that was in God he
[52:57] poured into Christ and according to Paul
[52:59] here all that was in Christ has been
[53:01] poured into the church or to the
[53:03] Believers who have the word of
[53:05] reconciliation now there now then we are
[53:08] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[53:11] beseech You by us we pray you in Christ
[53:15] dead be ye reconciled to God for he hath
[53:18] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[53:22] sin that we might be made the
[53:24] righteousness of God in him amen we ask
[53:28] the Lord this evening to add the
[53:29] blessing to the reading of his word as
[53:30] you can have your seats here this
[53:32] afternoon I want you by the help of the
[53:34] Lord for just a few moments if I could
[53:36] amen tonight to share something here
[53:38] with you on my heart if I would title
[53:40] this tonight I want to talk to you for a
[53:42] few moments on ambassadors with a true
[53:45] word experience amen ambassadors with a
[53:48] true word experience you know I believe
[53:52] that we are following amen the greatest
[53:54] message that has ever hit the face of
[53:56] the Earth
[53:57] and I believe that the message of the
[53:58] hour has restored to us amen the fact
[54:01] that there is a true word experience to
[54:04] be had amen by every believer in the
[54:06] Church of the Living God I was just
[54:08] listening to a tape recently and the
[54:10] prophet of God was speaking a greater
[54:11] than Solomon is here I want you to hear
[54:13] this he said now before we approach the
[54:16] word he said let's approach the author
[54:18] how many knows uh William Booth curn he
[54:20] said oh he's an orator he preaches in
[54:23] seven different languages he said he's
[54:25] an English man he said he's a fine man
[54:27] real good man he can preach the Bible in
[54:29] Greek he can preach it in anything he
[54:31] wants to he said he preaches it in seven
[54:33] languages so one day he said he and I
[54:36] was in treport with Brother Moore and we
[54:37] were discussing something and he said
[54:39] now I had the opposite side of the
[54:41] argument he said and I said something or
[54:44] another about it to brother BR brother
[54:45] booth and he said but listen here young
[54:48] fellow now I want you to catch this
[54:49] listen here young fellow he said you
[54:52] just don't know your Bible so here
[54:54] brother bradam is a young man a young
[54:55] fellow and he looks at him and he says
[54:58] you just don't know your Bible he said
[55:00] now that may be true brother boo but I
[55:02] know the author real well amen he said
[55:05] now isn't that cute said Jack you have
[55:07] to love him anyhow he said I would
[55:09] rather know the author amen than know
[55:12] his book because he will reveal the book
[55:15] if we know the author do you realize you
[55:17] can carry the book and not know the
[55:19] author amen you can read from the book
[55:21] and not know the author you can memorize
[55:23] things from the book amen and not know
[55:26] the author but if you ever meet the
[55:28] author amen you have met the originator
[55:30] of the word that you're carrying and he
[55:33] has the power by the spirit to impart
[55:35] unto you amen more than just a religion
[55:38] but an experience from that word now
[55:40] when you begin to think about young
[55:42] people there's one that really stands
[55:43] out to me amen and that's a man named
[55:45] Daniel how many here knows Daniel the
[55:48] Bible says in Daniel chapter 1 verse 8
[55:51] amen that Daniel purposed in his heart
[55:53] that he would not defile hisself with a
[55:55] portion of the king's meat nor with the
[55:58] wine which he drank therefore he
[56:01] requested of the prince of the Unix that
[56:03] he might not amen defile himself now we
[56:06] have to establish something here that
[56:08] Daniel Amen was a young man who was in
[56:11] Babylonian captivity and in the Book of
[56:13] Daniel chapter 9 and verse two the Bible
[56:16] said in the first year of his Reign I
[56:18] Daniel Amen understood by books the
[56:21] number of the years where of the word of
[56:23] the Lord came Amen to Jeremiah the
[56:26] Prophet that he would accomplish amen 70
[56:29] years in the desolations of Jerusalem
[56:32] Daniel said I set my face unto the Lord
[56:35] God Amen to seek by prayer and
[56:37] supplication amen with fasting and
[56:39] sackcloth and Ashes Ram comes along in
[56:42] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said
[56:45] now I want you to notice how Daniel yet
[56:47] an alien he was ousted from his people
[56:49] he was oued from his church he didn't
[56:51] have one church service without any
[56:54] church to go to without any hymns to be
[56:56] saying amen but what he's saying himself
[56:58] in the midst of all of this amen still
[57:01] held on to what the prophet said amen
[57:04] now no church to go to nobody to
[57:06] fellowship with amen everybody went to
[57:09] Heathen temples amen and everybody
[57:12] worship their Idols now think about this
[57:14] young people Daniel Amen he never had a
[57:17] Friday night youth service amen he never
[57:19] had a youth camp amen nearly every other
[57:22] month amen he never had Youth
[57:24] fellowships and youth get togethers amen
[57:26] the prophet of God said no Christian
[57:28] songs nobody amen believe the same thing
[57:31] that he did amen and in 68 years now
[57:34] watch from a young man of about 12 or 14
[57:38] years old amen he was taken down in
[57:41] there he said but he held true to God
[57:44] and understood by Jeremiah the prophet
[57:47] amen that the days were almost
[57:49] accomplished now when Jeremiah releases
[57:51] this message amen the only one that
[57:54] really called it was a young man who was
[57:56] named Daniel who believed what Jeremiah
[57:59] was saying amen concerning the future of
[58:02] Babylon let me say to you tonight young
[58:04] people amen we have not received another
[58:07] religion as as the message of the hour
[58:09] has come to us it has not come amen as a
[58:12] tradition or as a denomination amen but
[58:15] this message has come as instruction
[58:18] amen from almighty god listen now if God
[58:20] reveals something he's going to have
[58:22] somebody amen who will believe that
[58:25] message amen They will receive that
[58:27] message and they will manifest amen the
[58:30] promise of that message let me say
[58:32] Daniel a young man amen he lived in a
[58:34] day of critics the children of Israel
[58:36] had been taken from their Homeland they
[58:38] were down in Babylon amen they were sad
[58:41] and for some 70 years they had been down
[58:43] there but there was a young Prophet amen
[58:46] that went down there with him by the
[58:48] name of Daniel he said a handful of
[58:50] Brethren had got together and had vowed
[58:53] themselves to God they were not going to
[58:55] defile themselves amen with the Modern
[58:58] Trend of that day they wasn't going to
[59:00] fool with the king's meat they wasn't
[59:02] going to drink his strong drinks they
[59:04] wasn't going to attend his parties amen
[59:07] but they were going to keep themselves
[59:09] holy amen and dedicated to God Amen for
[59:13] thus it was becoming to them in other
[59:15] words it was becoming to Daniel Amen to
[59:18] stay with the word he said any true
[59:21] Prophet that knows the word of God Amen
[59:24] knows a true Prophet stays with the word
[59:27] he said Daniel knew that if he stayed
[59:28] with the word listen he knew what it was
[59:31] going to cost him listen Daniel didn't
[59:33] look at it and say oh my amen it's going
[59:36] to cost too much he said it was going to
[59:38] cost him his popularity it was going to
[59:41] cost him his Fellowship amen with the
[59:43] rest of the Brethren it was going to
[59:45] cost them a lot of things amen but they
[59:47] made an issue that they were going to
[59:49] pray to a certain God Amen then after
[59:52] they could go back and pray to any God
[59:54] Amen but you know something about Our
[59:56] God Amen is we don't compromise with God
[1:00:00] Amen there's no compromising with God
[1:00:03] Amen God just stays God he don't expect
[1:00:06] us on Sunday to be Christians amen
[1:00:08] praising him and worshiping him and on
[1:00:10] Monday wishy-washy and take it down and
[1:00:13] all kinds of faults that maybe I was
[1:00:15] wrong and ought to have done this or
[1:00:16] that amen we stay right centered Amen on
[1:00:20] God's word and we lay right to it I say
[1:00:23] God give us a young person amen that
[1:00:26] will take a hold of the message of the
[1:00:27] hour amen they won't be wishy-washy they
[1:00:30] won't just serve God Amen when they're
[1:00:32] with their friends they just won't serve
[1:00:34] God when they're at Youth Camp amen but
[1:00:36] they'll serve God on Monday and they'll
[1:00:38] serve God on Tuesday and they'll serve
[1:00:40] God on Friday amen because you have not
[1:00:43] been brought into this amen by Mommy's
[1:00:46] religion or Daddy's religion amen but
[1:00:48] God by a true word experience has
[1:00:51] birthed you into a word that has the
[1:00:53] power to defeat the Devil anywhere
[1:00:56] anytime any place under any condition
[1:00:59] listen Daniel wasn't ashamed amen of the
[1:01:02] word amen that he believed you say
[1:01:04] Daniel was different I say praise God
[1:01:07] Amen that in the middle of a of a of
[1:01:10] of can we just preach Amen in the middle
[1:01:13] of captivity there was a young man that
[1:01:16] God Amen could place his hand upon let
[1:01:19] me say Daniel was different than any
[1:01:21] other young man I believe in that age
[1:01:23] because God Amen had in invested in
[1:01:26] Daniel Amen a prophetic message amen I
[1:01:29] want to read a quote brother said Daniel
[1:01:31] was a prophet he said and the words of
[1:01:33] God Amen the Bible was invested to
[1:01:37] Daniel Amen to manifest to the people
[1:01:40] amen that God still lived when there was
[1:01:43] no church to go to when there were no
[1:01:45] songs to Be Sung when there were no
[1:01:47] youth camps to attend when there were no
[1:01:50] youth fellowships to go to amen there
[1:01:52] was a young man who had a heart and
[1:01:54] inside of that heart he had a soul and
[1:01:57] there had been a word deposited amen
[1:01:59] into that life amen to manifest to them
[1:02:02] heathens that there is a God Amen and
[1:02:05] he's not a god of wood and he's not a
[1:02:07] god of stone you say well that was
[1:02:09] Daniel I say what about you young man
[1:02:12] amen what about you young ladies amen
[1:02:14] the same God of Daniel is your god
[1:02:16] tonight and he by the message of the
[1:02:19] hour has invested his word into your
[1:02:22] soul to make a living declaration to
[1:02:24] this world my God is not dead he is a
[1:02:28] living God he can save a soul he can
[1:02:31] heal a body he can redeem a mind he can
[1:02:34] deliver a young person listen I think
[1:02:36] it's time Amen to remember we're not
[1:02:38] just ordinary Christians amen we're not
[1:02:41] just generic young people we are
[1:02:43] following a prophetic word that God has
[1:02:46] invested into our
[1:02:49] lives Daniel Amen he purposed in his
[1:02:52] heart that he would not defile amen his
[1:02:56] investment he said oh if the church amen
[1:02:58] could only do that today if the church
[1:03:01] could only purpose in your heart amen
[1:03:03] that you won't defile amen your
[1:03:05] investment with any type of the things
[1:03:08] amen that brings you into a system amen
[1:03:10] that will take you away from him listen
[1:03:13] Daniel purposed in his heart amen and
[1:03:15] what did it do amen it saved his life
[1:03:18] from the lines amen God got a hold of
[1:03:21] Daniel and Daniel purposed in his heart
[1:03:24] amen that he would not def himself amen
[1:03:27] with the things of Babylon but he would
[1:03:29] stand for Jehovah oh young people amen I
[1:03:32] want to say to you tonight amen how many
[1:03:34] will say God on this Friday night amen I
[1:03:37] want to pledge allegiance to the Lamb of
[1:03:39] God and say I will not defile myself

[1:03:50] sports I will not be a billboard amen
[1:03:52] for country music or rap music amen I
[1:03:55] have been called as a Daniel in this
[1:03:58] generation and God loved me enough that
[1:04:01] he invested his word into me my I know
[1:04:05] amen I know that's hard to comprehend
[1:04:07] amen I know that's a hard fault to wrap
[1:04:09] your mind around amen that God which is
[1:04:12] deity amen would invest in humanity amen
[1:04:15] if you're going to invest in something
[1:04:17] amen you want to invest in something
[1:04:19] amen that's going to give some good
[1:04:21] benefits or some good returns down the
[1:04:23] road oh Church of the Living God God
[1:04:26] Amen and when you are the highest of
[1:04:28] highs when you are God himself amen come
[1:04:31] on church that would be like that would
[1:04:33] be like Elon Musk who is a billionaire
[1:04:35] or whatever he is amen looking around
[1:04:38] and saying I think I'm going to go down
[1:04:39] here amen and invest in Dollar General
[1:04:42] come on church amen let me just let me
[1:04:44] break it down a little bit more simpler
[1:04:46] amen you take Elon Musk amen and take
[1:04:49] him downtown and find some bum Amen on
[1:04:51] the side of the road amen that's got a
[1:04:53] cardboard sign amen that says will work
[1:04:56] for food ain't never struck a lick at
[1:04:58] nothing amen and Elon says today I'm
[1:05:00] going to invest a million dollars in
[1:05:02] this man list said he's going to invest
[1:05:05] Amen in something that appears amen
[1:05:07] that's going to return benefits amen but
[1:05:10] my God Amen is not an Edwards and Jones
[1:05:13] Financial investor amen my God is not a
[1:05:16] stock market amen or trade world Amen
[1:05:19] investor but my God Amen chose the
[1:05:21] lowest of the lows amen and he invested
[1:05:25] come on Church he invested his blood
[1:05:27] into you he invested his word into you
[1:05:30] he invested his power into you listen I
[1:05:32] know when God put a seed in my soul amen
[1:05:35] it didn't look like much amen when God
[1:05:37] put a seed in your soul it didn't look
[1:05:40] like much amen but today amen God who is
[1:05:43] rich in Mercy is standing back and
[1:05:46] looking at the Devil and saying look at
[1:05:48] that young man and look at that young
[1:05:50] girl everything I invested in them amen
[1:05:53] is paying off in the hour that they're
[1:05:55] living in my goodness to think that God
[1:05:59] Amen which is deity would invest in us
[1:06:02] which is
[1:06:04] Humanity now when you think of this word
[1:06:06] invest it means to commit money in order
[1:06:09] to earn a financial return it means to
[1:06:12] make use of for future benefits or
[1:06:14] advantages it means to furnish with
[1:06:17] power or authority so when you invest in
[1:06:20] something you are Furnishing what you
[1:06:23] are investing in with your power and
[1:06:25] your Authority it means look to Grant
[1:06:28] someone control amen or authority over
[1:06:32] it means to endow with equality listen
[1:06:35] it means to cover completely do you
[1:06:38] realize the prophet of God Amen said
[1:06:40] that we are the elect of God and he said
[1:06:43] therefore being the elect of God he said
[1:06:45] in the elect of God Amen there is a fine
[1:06:49] quality amen there is a fine quality
[1:06:52] that has been given to the elect of God
[1:06:55] listen the election of God Amen has set
[1:06:57] you apart amen from the Modern Trend of
[1:07:00] Christianity the world is full of two
[1:07:02] types of Christianity remember said one
[1:07:05] of them amen is an intellectual
[1:07:07] conception he said but the other one is
[1:07:09] an experimental experience now I don't
[1:07:12] know about you amen but I don't believe
[1:07:14] in no intellectual conception amen but I
[1:07:17] believe in an experimental experience
[1:07:19] amen with not just the word amen but the
[1:07:22] author of the word amen I don't just
[1:07:24] want to carry the word amen I want to
[1:07:27] meet the author I want to know him Amen
[1:07:30] in the grace and the truth that he has
[1:07:32] been manifested in this age in B said
[1:07:35] the true word amen comes to the true
[1:07:37] Prophet amen and he tells you the true
[1:07:40] word he said if you follow that true
[1:07:42] word then you will get a true experience
[1:07:45] amen of the word because the word is
[1:07:48] made flesh in you and you become God's
[1:07:51] son and the word of God is revolving
[1:07:54] right out of God amen into you because
[1:07:57] you are of his nature amen his spirit is
[1:08:00] in you and you'll do the works of God so
[1:08:04] if God invest in you he is investing his
[1:08:07] nature in you he is investing his
[1:08:10] authority in you he is investing his
[1:08:12] power in you listen just like he did
[1:08:15] Apostle Paul listen Paul knew amen that
[1:08:18] he had an experience Amen brother said
[1:08:20] here's a good lesson for us amen that
[1:08:23] experience alone isn't enough he said
[1:08:25] it's got to be amen an experience
[1:08:29] according Amen to the word of the Lord
[1:08:32] he said taking the Bible he said that's
[1:08:34] the true experience amen of every real
[1:08:37] believer who meets God Amen is you come
[1:08:40] in contact with something amen that it
[1:08:42] is so great that you become a prisoner
[1:08:45] to everything else see you get away from
[1:08:48] everything Amen to imprison yourself to
[1:08:52] this what are you imprisoning yourself
[1:08:54] to Amen to the word of God that has been
[1:08:58] invested in you amen by the god of
[1:09:00] Daniel let me say this I know it's an
[1:09:02] hour amen where there is a falling away
[1:09:05] brother said see there seems to be a
[1:09:06] falling away people not interested
[1:09:09] anymore he said they're falling away
[1:09:11] amen from the fundamental facts amen of
[1:09:15] the Bible he said they seem to be
[1:09:17] drifting let me just say this it's an
[1:09:19] hour amen when people amen they're just
[1:09:21] throwing in the towel amen young people
[1:09:24] amen just giving up they're growing
[1:09:26] weary amen and they're simply walking
[1:09:28] away and the question comes about amen
[1:09:31] how can someone do that well let me say
[1:09:34] this it's because they never had a true
[1:09:38] word experience if they ever had a true
[1:09:41] word experience it would have took them
[1:09:43] Beyond an intellectual conception into a
[1:09:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they would
[1:09:48] not be sealed until the next youth
[1:09:51] meeting they would not be sealed until
[1:09:53] the next Youth Camp but they would be
[1:09:55] seal healed until the day of their
[1:09:57] Redemption I say it's time Amen to open
[1:10:00] up the doors and let the sealing angel
[1:10:02] of God Amen come back in the church in
[1:10:05] the power and the authority of his seal
[1:10:08] upon the soul of an
[1:10:11] individual yes sir you say well I'm
[1:10:13] sitting in church well there's people
[1:10:15] amen sitting in church today without an
[1:10:16] experience remember said it's Such a
[1:10:18] Pity to see men women who have lived in
[1:10:21] the church they have been brought up in
[1:10:22] this crater role amen and they know the
[1:10:25] the Bible well but yet has never
[1:10:27] witnessed an experience with God he said
[1:10:30] what we need is to get back to the real
[1:10:32] heartfelt experience to know who you got
[1:10:35] faith in amen not some writings amen but
[1:10:39] the true and living God who lives now I
[1:10:43] make this statement without any
[1:10:44] reservation there is nothing young
[1:10:46] people that will take the place amen of
[1:10:49] a Bible word experience with God in your
[1:10:52] soul education will never do it
[1:10:55] denomination will never do it there will
[1:10:57] never be an organization ever substitute
[1:11:00] amen The Upper Room experience there'll
[1:11:02] never be a school that'll ever take the
[1:11:05] place of Pentecost because it can't amen
[1:11:08] not by power not by might but by my
[1:11:10] spirit sayth the Lord he said that's
[1:11:13] what we need today amen is back to the
[1:11:15] Bible experience amen Christians that
[1:11:18] are born again they are washed in the
[1:11:20] blood of the Lamb amen they are made
[1:11:22] white and they are regenerated and they
[1:11:24] have been Christ born I say oh God Amen
[1:11:27] on this Friday night amen from the
[1:11:30] oldest to the youngest amen from the
[1:11:32] puppet to the back door from the right
[1:11:34] to the left amen may God come down in
[1:11:37] our midst tonight and may He begin to
[1:11:39] search out every heart may he begin to
[1:11:42] search out every life and may He begin
[1:11:44] to see if there's a word experience on
[1:11:47] the inside of that
[1:11:48] Soul yes sir I think of what David said
[1:11:51] David said search me oh God and know my
[1:11:54] heart he said try me amen and know my
[1:11:58] thoughts how many said Lord come in this
[1:12:00] meeting tonight and search my heart amen
[1:12:03] search my life amen know my thoughts
[1:12:06] said if listen he said if the thing is
[1:12:08] up to you to receive it or to reject it
[1:12:11] he said listen it does not relay or it
[1:12:13] does not lay within whether your church
[1:12:15] accepts it it's whether you accept it
[1:12:17] see salvation is a personal work it's a
[1:12:20] personal faith it's not a universal
[1:12:22] church Faith it's a personal faith in
[1:12:25] the Lord Jesus listen I'm going to say
[1:12:27] what a prophet said he said no matter if
[1:12:30] father don't believe and mother don't
[1:12:32] believe it's what you believe come on
[1:12:35] this goes beyond what your mama believes
[1:12:37] and what your daddy believes listen it
[1:12:39] don't matter if they believe this
[1:12:40] message or not if God chose you from
[1:12:43] before the foundation of the world he
[1:12:45] put a seed in your soul listen there
[1:12:48] ain't enough devils in Hell Amen to back
[1:12:50] off a Son of God on their way to me a
[1:12:53] promise of God Hallelujah well listen it
[1:12:56] don't matter how they receive it or not
[1:12:58] he said oh people this day can't you see
[1:13:01] amen the gospel of Christ has been
[1:13:04] rejected he said I think that if that be
[1:13:06] the case that each one of us should take
[1:13:08] inventory of our own
[1:13:11] experience of our own standings with God
[1:13:15] look here and see how we stand in his
[1:13:18] sight now that really brings the rubber
[1:13:20] down to the road amen that we find out
[1:13:23] where we stand amen not in our preacher
[1:13:25] side or in our Sunday school teacher
[1:13:27] side amen or in our youth leader side or
[1:13:30] even in our Mom and Daddy's side amen
[1:13:32] but how do we stand in the sight of God
[1:13:36] in Romans chapter 3 and: 20 Paul says
[1:13:39] therefore by the Deeds of the law there
[1:13:41] shall be no flesh amen be justified in
[1:13:44] his sight for by the law is the
[1:13:47] knowledge of sin in Colossians 121 and
[1:13:50] you that were sometime alienated and
[1:13:52] enemies in your mind by Wicked works
[1:13:55] amen yet now hath he reconciled in the
[1:13:58] body of his flesh through death to
[1:14:00] present you holy and unblamable and
[1:14:03] unreprovable in his sight I love Hebrews
[1:14:06] 13:21 he said that God would make you
[1:14:09] perfect in every good work to do his
[1:14:11] will amen working in you that which is
[1:14:14] well pleasing in his sight amen through
[1:14:18] Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever
[1:14:21] and ever amen in 1 John chapter 3 and:
[1:14:24] 22 he says whatsoever we ask amen we
[1:14:27] receive of him because we keep his
[1:14:30] Commandments and do those things that
[1:14:33] are pleasing in his sight let me just
[1:14:36] ask you this amen is what you're wearing
[1:14:38] pleasing in his sight is the music
[1:14:41] you're listening to amen is it pleasing
[1:14:43] in his side amen is the places you're
[1:14:46] going and the relationships that you're
[1:14:48] building amen are they pleasing in his
[1:14:50] sight I don't care about the Modern
[1:14:52] Trend I don't care about Leota I don't
[1:14:55] care about the boys club or the Girls
[1:14:57] Club I care about the house of God and I
[1:15:00] think it's time we let the Holy Ghost
[1:15:02] amen come into the doors of our heart
[1:15:05] amen and search out amen the door of
[1:15:07] Pride search out the door of Faith
[1:15:09] search out the door of side oh God come
[1:15:12] into my heart tonight I don't want to
[1:15:14] leave here in good side of my daddy or
[1:15:16] mama or my preacher and being in bad
[1:15:18] side of you Lord I want to be in God's
[1:15:21] good sides I want the blessings of God
[1:15:24] Amen to cover my
[1:15:25] lie yes sir you say well it's it's time
[1:15:29] it is time brother said it's matching
[1:15:31] time he said you know that's true it's a
[1:15:34] matching time he said I'm going to tell
[1:15:36] you my brother I don't care whether my
[1:15:38] shoes match my
[1:15:41] trousers come on or my trousers match my
[1:15:45] coat come on I want my experience to
[1:15:49] match God's Bible That's the matching
[1:15:52] time if you want to match something amen
[1:15:54] then match your experience against
[1:15:57] Paul's amen that's what we need today is
[1:15:59] a matching time with Paul's faith in the
[1:16:02] Bible that's right that's our example
[1:16:05] amen don't try to match your neighbor
[1:16:07] match some of the Saints of the Bible if
[1:16:09] you're a saint act like a saint amen
[1:16:12] walk like a saint dress like a saint
[1:16:14] amen talk like a saint pray like a saint
[1:16:17] believe like a saint shout like a saint
[1:16:20] be like a saint live like a saint and
[1:16:23] die like a saint and go go to heaven
[1:16:25] like a
[1:16:26] saint you say well that's a lot of
[1:16:28] saints well I'm preaching to some saints
[1:16:30] tonight and I think it's time to
[1:16:31] remember whose side are we standing in
[1:16:34] it's pleasing unto
[1:16:36] God now when you think of this word
[1:16:38] experience I I think it's a very
[1:16:40] powerful definition it is a practical
[1:16:42] contact amen with an observation of
[1:16:45] facts or events listen it is an event
[1:16:47] somebody say an event it is an event or
[1:16:50] An Occurrence amen that leaves an
[1:16:53] impression on someone it means to
[1:16:55] encounter or to undergo amen an event or
[1:16:59] An Occurrence it means to feel an
[1:17:02] emotion in other words an experience
[1:17:04] happens amen when contact is made now
[1:17:07] our Jeremiah or our prophet of this day
[1:17:10] has come in this age and he said these
[1:17:12] words he said now we're going to read
[1:17:14] some of God's word tonight and we're
[1:17:16] going to be ready for this event of his
[1:17:20] presence again Amen to bring us his word
[1:17:23] listen the presence of God Amen was
[1:17:26] coming to the Church of God Amen to
[1:17:28] bring a change in the life of the
[1:17:30] members of that church he said when we
[1:17:33] come into His presence when a man once
[1:17:35] comes into the presence of God he is
[1:17:38] changed forever if there's any change to
[1:17:41] him now there are those who could walk
[1:17:43] in the presence of God and pay no
[1:17:45] attention to it he wasn't ordained to
[1:17:48] life but if he was predestinated to God
[1:17:51] as soon as that first move hits amen he
[1:17:54] know knows it and that catches fire
[1:17:57] listen I'll say this when we come into
[1:18:00] His presence we are changed amen never
[1:18:03] to be the same look all down to the ages
[1:18:06] of every Walk of Life at man amen look
[1:18:09] at Abraham you say well amen the changed
[1:18:12] life help me somebody say the changed
[1:18:15] life the changed life said will you say
[1:18:19] brother brandom the change life is just
[1:18:21] for the minister he said oh no the
[1:18:24] change life is for everybody now let me
[1:18:27] say this the power of change amen is a
[1:18:30] believer in contact with his maker said
[1:18:33] one of the doctors said I tell you the
[1:18:34] greatest power in the world is not the
[1:18:36] atomic bomb amen but a believer in
[1:18:39] contact with his maker it changes the
[1:18:42] whole attitude it changes his mental it
[1:18:45] changes his habits it changes his body
[1:18:49] it changes his nature amen it changes
[1:18:52] everything when a man comes in contact
[1:18:55] with God Amen the presence of God
[1:18:57] bringing his word to the church changes
[1:19:00] the heart it changes the mental it
[1:19:03] changes the attitude I know people say
[1:19:05] serving God is difficult amen but I say
[1:19:08] a true experience of the word of God in
[1:19:10] the presence of God Amen will make
[1:19:12] serving God Amen the easiest thing you
[1:19:15] ever did in your
[1:19:17] life our personal experience comes in
[1:19:20] your heart and said what does it do he
[1:19:23] said it burns all the dullness out and
[1:19:25] it gives you a new vision listen in
[1:19:28] Matthew 13:15 the Bible said this for
[1:19:31] the people's heart is wax gross and
[1:19:33] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[1:19:36] eyes they have closed listen their heart
[1:19:39] is wax gross their eyes or rather their
[1:19:42] ears are dull of hearing yeah this
[1:19:46] getting pretty bad shape their eyes have
[1:19:49] closed lest at any time they should see
[1:19:52] with their eyes they should hear with
[1:19:54] their ears and should understand their
[1:19:58] heart yeah with their heart look and
[1:20:01] should be converted and I should heal
[1:20:04] them so brother B said what is it it's a
[1:20:07] true experience that produces a
[1:20:09] conversion he said see it's got to be a
[1:20:12] change here it is a change of heart not
[1:20:15] of this physical thing but the heart of
[1:20:18] your soul in something anchors to your
[1:20:21] thoughts the way is though you don't see
[1:20:23] that no more amen you just see the Lord
[1:20:26] Jesus you see righteousness and Holiness
[1:20:29] and Purity and love and grace that's
[1:20:32] when you have been changed listen what
[1:20:35] is a convert amen a convert means to
[1:20:37] change something over and your thoughts
[1:20:40] and your habits and your being has been
[1:20:43] changed amen from a sinner to a
[1:20:45] Christian are y'all ready for this amen
[1:20:48] the first thing you know it's in your
[1:20:50] heart he said then you express it with
[1:20:52] your lips amen and then it materializes
[1:20:56] when there's a change in the heart there
[1:20:58] will be a change in the mouth and there
[1:21:00] will be a change of the atmosphere that
[1:21:03] is materializing around you listen
[1:21:06] anything I can say to you tonight amen
[1:21:08] that is absolutely essential it is
[1:21:10] necessary it is compelling and
[1:21:12] compulsory amen that you receive the
[1:21:15] Holy Ghost In Your Heart amen that there
[1:21:18] would be a change in your mouth there
[1:21:20] would be a change in your walk there
[1:21:21] would be a change in your talk listen I
[1:21:24] say oh God fill our young people with
[1:21:26] the Holy Ghost in fire until it changes
[1:21:28] them from the top of their head yes sir
[1:21:32] to the soul of their feet now you say
[1:21:35] preacher you're getting out there I'm
[1:21:37] preaching about an experience amen and
[1:21:39] an ambassador that has one because an
[1:21:42] experience with God Amen is not it it it
[1:21:45] it is and not was essential now let me
[1:21:49] say this brother ra ask a question do
[1:21:51] your children have to have an experience
[1:21:52] to have the Holy Spirit now can I read
[1:21:54] the rest of the question if they see the
[1:21:57] end time message do they have the Holy
[1:22:01] Spirit he said everyone must have an
[1:22:04] experience your children cannot go in
[1:22:07] another way but the same way you do see
[1:22:10] they've got to be born again there's no
[1:22:13] grandchildren in the kingdom of God
[1:22:16] they're all children see they must have
[1:22:18] it they must have an experience with God
[1:22:21] Amen to go in amen just the same as you
[1:22:26] now come on I'm going preach to the the

[1:24:59] example have proved the strength and the
[1:25:03] genuiness of their faith in Christ amen
[1:25:06] by undergoing a violent death now I know
[1:25:09] what you're thinking you're thinking
[1:25:10] brother Andrew you saying I got to die
[1:25:13] to be a spiritual witness no the prophet
[1:25:16] of God said amen that the new birth is a

[1:26:12] word experience amen does away amen with
[1:26:15] some flexibility of the Holy Ghost I
[1:26:17] think our young people shouldn't have to
[1:26:19] sit around and hear stories of 50 years
[1:26:22] ago and 40 years ago and 20 years ago of
[1:26:26] how the Holy Ghost fail and how the Holy
[1:26:28] Ghost done things I think we ought to
[1:26:30] build a campfire in the house of God and
[1:26:33] kick out the spirit of dryness kick out
[1:26:35] the spirit of selfishness and bring in
[1:26:38] some flexibility of the Holy Ghost I say
[1:26:41] let them shout until they enjoy the
[1:26:43] blessings of God let them Rejoice until
[1:26:46] they know there's a God who has saved
[1:26:48] their soul who has delivered their mind
[1:26:50] and who has sealed them until the day of
[1:26:53] their Redemption
[1:26:55] yes sir somebody shout hallelujah
[1:26:57] somebody shout glory to God somebody
[1:27:00] shout thank you
[1:27:01] Jesus and then get rid of that old
[1:27:03] dryness and
[1:27:05] [Applause]
[1:27:07] selfishness I'll just say this thank God

[1:27:10] night you needed to get saved come
[1:27:14] on come on and thank God nobody was
[1:27:16] wondering how many notes the preacher
[1:27:17] had the not you needed a break
[1:27:20] through come on somebody listen be sure
[1:27:23] in your heart that God has separated you
[1:27:26] from the things of the world and made
[1:27:28] you a new creature listen I don't just
[1:27:31] want to know brother Joe that he
[1:27:33] separated my feet I don't just want to
[1:27:35] know that he separated my hands I want
[1:27:38] to know that he separated my
[1:27:41] heart brother Harvey I want to know that
[1:27:44] he's changed my heart he's changed my
[1:27:47] soul Hallelujah he said then go tell the

[1:27:52] that's dead in Christ you can't offer
[1:27:54] him a drink you can give him this out
[1:27:56] the other but he's dead and he's hid in
[1:27:58] Christ through God and he's sealed by
[1:28:00] the Holy Spirit now then he cannot do
[1:28:03] those things because he just can't do it
[1:28:06] it's against his nature see he becomes a
[1:28:11] new
[1:28:13] creature let me just say this to you you
[1:28:16] don't just wake up one morning and
[1:28:17] decide to be a witness right you don't

[1:28:38] or a witness for the Lord you got to
[1:28:40] know something now come on Church you
[1:28:43] got to know something you know what
[1:28:44] Daniel said he said is such as do
[1:28:46] wickedly against the Covenant Daniel
[1:28:48] 11:32 as such as do wickedly against the
[1:28:50] Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries

[1:29:04] no my Bible said the people that do know
[1:29:07] their God they shall be strong and they
[1:29:10] shall do exploits look at this word know
[1:29:13] it means to know by experience it means
[1:29:16] to be acquainted with remember so when a

[1:29:20] God he becomes acquainted and a person
[1:29:24] personality of God is in him he said get
[1:29:27] a cleaning with God what was it amen it
[1:29:30] was spiritual Revelation that he would
[1:29:32] build his church upon listen it's after
[1:29:35] you become acquainted with God that you
[1:29:38] could take his word for anything let me
[1:29:41] just say this Satan has done everything
[1:29:44] he can Amen to hinder people from
[1:29:47] becoming acquainted with god he has
[1:29:49] tried prophecies he has tried seminaries
[1:29:52] he has tried theology amen he's tried
[1:29:54] everything he can Amen to take Daniel
[1:29:58] 11:32 out of the Bible all right now
[1:30:01] come on church amen if you were the
[1:30:02] devil and you had read the back of the
[1:30:04] book and you know there was a people who
[1:30:07] was going to know their God and by
[1:30:09] knowing their God they were going to be
[1:30:11] strong and they were going to do great
[1:30:13] exploits and the Bible said they
[1:30:15] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:30:19] their God and the word of their
[1:30:21] testimony If I Was the Devil I would do
[1:30:24] everything I could Amen to make sure
[1:30:27] that Daniel
[1:30:28] 11:32 never become more than a scripture
[1:30:31] it never become more than just a quote
[1:30:34] but it become a reality but I say
[1:30:36] tonight the devil don't have enough Amen
[1:30:38] to stop Daniel 11:32 from taking on
[1:30:44] flesh he don't have enough he don't have
[1:30:47] enough to stop amen this scripture from
[1:30:50] taking on flesh in your flesh I say
[1:30:53] there is a young people who's going to
[1:30:55] know their God and they're going to be
[1:30:58] strong sir they're going to be strong
[1:31:02] and they're going to do great exploits
[1:31:05] what are you saying I'm saying there's a
[1:31:07] people who's going to know their God
[1:31:10] Beyond just an intellectual conception
[1:31:13] job 42:5 says I have heard of thee by
[1:31:16] the hearing of the ear amen but now mine
[1:31:20] eye see a the brother said see therefore
[1:31:23] no no man exactly can witness to the
[1:31:26] resurrection of Christ amen only by the
[1:31:29] Holy Spirit I love this he said sometime
[1:31:33] or another you're going to have to
[1:31:36] show what you're made out of because the
[1:31:40] devil is going to call your hand every
[1:31:43] man that professes to be a Christian
[1:31:46] remember talks about Tommy Osborne he
[1:31:48] said he was a man in brother B's
[1:31:50] meetings and he said he saw that how
[1:31:51] many ever heard brother B tell about the
[1:31:53] maniac that came and fell across his
[1:31:55] feet he said that Maniac came he said he
[1:31:58] fell across my feet remember that if
[1:32:00] you're familiar raise your hand if not
[1:32:01] I'll tell it okay he said like this he
[1:32:03] said he come up there and brother said
[1:32:05] roll him off my feet he said I'll break
[1:32:07] every bone in your body right he said
[1:32:10] okay he said all right he said I'll
[1:32:11] follow he said said but the Lord spoke
[1:32:13] and said you'll fall over my feet right
[1:32:16] said I stood there he said he come and
[1:32:18] he drew his fist back and he said when
[1:32:20] he drew his fist back he said he fell
[1:32:22] and fell across my feet exactly as the
[1:32:24] word said he would do brother said very
[1:32:26] beautiful he said the police officer
[1:32:28] come up there and he said uh sir he said
[1:32:31] would you mind to get him off my feet
[1:32:33] brother BR want to go and preach the
[1:32:34] gospel you know he said would you mind
[1:32:36] to get him off my feet and the police
[1:32:38] officer looks at brother brandom and
[1:32:40] says brother brandom is he delivered he
[1:32:42] said no he worships that spirit so
[1:32:46] brother Tommy Osburn saw that and he
[1:32:48] said brother
[1:32:50] Brandon he said what can I do to see
[1:32:53] things like like this I said now Tommy

[1:32:58] back up are you with me I'm turning the
[1:33:00] corner do not profess anything that you
[1:33:04] cannot back up the devil is going to
[1:33:07] call your hand on it yes he will he will
[1:33:11] do it right away I said then if you
[1:33:13] can't back it up you know what's a
[1:33:16] coming it will be a reproach he said so
[1:33:20] be sure that you are right before you
[1:33:23] make your statement I say this today
[1:33:25] church and I I I want to turn a corner
[1:33:28] and say this if you're going to be an
[1:33:31] ambassador how many believes God's
[1:33:33] called you to be one four of you how
[1:33:36] many believes God has called you to be
[1:33:38] an ambassador you say I'm too young God
[1:33:41] didn't ask how old you were you say well
[1:33:43] I'm too little God didn't ask how big
[1:33:45] you were he called you to be an
[1:33:48] ambassador listen to me tonight friends
[1:33:51] and if God called you then God will
[1:33:53] position place you and God will cause
[1:33:56] his word amen to revolve out of you and
[1:33:59] whatever you say amen God will back up
[1:34:02] amen can I just say something to you
[1:34:04] young people don't you ever be scared of
[1:34:06] the devil don't you ever be scared of
[1:34:09] Satan or lay out of sea don't you ever
[1:34:12] be scared you know who you are you know
[1:34:15] who you believed in you know who saved
[1:34:18] your soul and you know you are an
[1:34:20] ambassador of Jesus Christ
[1:34:24] now what are you saying I'm saying an
[1:34:25] ambassador is the highest ranking person
[1:34:29] who represents his or her own government
[1:34:32] now listen in the economy of God it is
[1:34:35] while living in another
[1:34:38] country my goodness so what is an
[1:34:41] ambassador he is they are an authorized
[1:34:44] representative or messenger now do you
[1:34:48] know if you actually start studying
[1:34:49] about ambassadors that there's actually
[1:34:51] 12 different characteristics of an
[1:34:53] ambassador
[1:34:54] actually I I'm I'm I wish I had time on
[1:34:57] every one of them but I don't but
[1:34:58] they're very astounding because the
[1:35:00] first one is that this Ambassador is
[1:35:03] appointed by the
[1:35:05] King come on he don't just wake up and
[1:35:09] walk in the living room and mama say
[1:35:11] buddy you got some big muscles you could
[1:35:13] be an
[1:35:14] ambassador but he is appointed by the
[1:35:17] king listen to this amen now listen he
[1:35:20] is not voted into position that's right
[1:35:24] oh God if he's voted in then somebody
[1:35:27] can vote him out but if he is appointed
[1:35:30] they are put there by the king look at
[1:35:32] this second one they are appointed Amen
[1:35:35] to represent the state or the kingdom I
[1:35:38] love this third one they are committed
[1:35:40] only to the interest of that
[1:35:44] country I love this one they embody the
[1:35:48] state the nation or the kingdom now are
[1:35:51] y'all hearing me and ambassador okay so
[1:35:54] if you have an ambassador from America
[1:35:56] amen that goes over to China or goes
[1:35:58] over to Africa or goes over to Germany
[1:36:01] or Russia or anywhere else they go over
[1:36:03] there now listen when they go there amen
[1:36:05] they're not there representing them own
[1:36:07] selves they are there representing the
[1:36:10] country and the leadership that sent
[1:36:12] them and when they go they're actually
[1:36:15] embodying the country or the state or
[1:36:18] the nation or the kingdom in their own
[1:36:21] body look what the pro of God says he
[1:36:24] said now he embodies himself and he
[1:36:27] takes your body and he takes my body and
[1:36:30] he gives you gifts he gives me gifts and
[1:36:33] through them gifts He makes himself
[1:36:36] known listen when Daniel went down to
[1:36:39] Babylon he was not there representing
[1:36:43] the Babylonian captivity but God by
[1:36:46] Jeremiah's message had so embodied
[1:36:49] himself into Daniel that when Daniel
[1:36:51] went down there he could not drink the
[1:36:54] King's Wine he could not eat the king's
[1:36:56] meat because he had been invested by God
[1:36:59] to be an ambassador what are you saying
[1:37:03] I'm saying deity will be tabernacled in
[1:37:06] men are you hearing me the god of Heaven
[1:37:10] who has put you in Leona as his
[1:37:13] Ambassador will embody you by the power
[1:37:16] of the Holy Ghost listen when God
[1:37:19] invested in you he covered you he
[1:37:21] completely covered you he give you his
[1:37:24] power he give you his authority he give
[1:37:27] you his word and he said speak my word
[1:37:30] yes
[1:37:31] sir and I will back it up now listen
[1:37:35] what this is It's deity tabernacled in
[1:37:40] man I love this one an ambassador is
[1:37:44] totally covered by the state by the
[1:37:46] state I like this one they are the
[1:37:49] responsibility of the state yes they are
[1:37:52] totally
[1:37:54] protected by the government oh
[1:37:58] God if an ambassador from America goes
[1:38:01] to
[1:38:02] China they are totally
[1:38:05] covered sir by the protection of the
[1:38:10] country they're
[1:38:12] representing what are you saying in
[1:38:13] other words I'm saying when they go into
[1:38:16] that country if they get in
[1:38:20] trouble if they get in trouble in that
[1:38:23] country there is a kingdom oh God there
[1:38:26] is a kingdom that is backing them up
[1:38:30] that will get them out of the trouble in
[1:38:32] other words no weapon come on that is
[1:38:35] formed against thee shall prosper listen
[1:38:39] he never said it wouldn't be formed he
[1:38:42] just said it wouldn't Prosper are you
[1:38:44] hearing me he never said that the
[1:38:47] weapons wouldn't come against you he
[1:38:49] just said amen I am your shield and I am
[1:38:52] your buckle I am the sword I am the
[1:38:55] breastplate come on ambassadors it's
[1:38:58] time to quit backing up from your
[1:38:59] assignment it's time to step into
[1:39:02] position under the headship of your king
[1:39:05] and do what he's positioned you and
[1:39:07] appointed you to do you say well I've
[1:39:09] been appointed leosa you've been put
[1:39:12] here to tear down the devil's Kingdom
[1:39:14] you've been put here to overcome Leota
[1:39:17] you have been put here to walk on the
[1:39:20] head of every devil
[1:39:24] yes sir not been put here to be the
[1:39:25] overcome you've been put here to be the
[1:39:28] Overcomer sir it's the truth now I might
[1:39:32] as well just preach this
[1:39:34] one an ambassador never somebody say
[1:39:37] never becomes a citizen of the state or
[1:39:42] the kingdom to which he is
[1:39:46] assigned they never become a
[1:39:50] citizen to the kingdom or the state that
[1:39:55] they're assigned so they go in there as
[1:39:58] an ambassador from America and they
[1:40:02] never give up their message I mean their
[1:40:05] American
[1:40:07] identity and take on China's Identity or
[1:40:09] Germany's Identity or Russia's identity
[1:40:12] no because they're an ambassador I love
[1:40:15] this one they can only be recalled by
[1:40:18] the king or the president who appointed
[1:40:21] them oh my oh yeah yes so they can't
[1:40:24] just wake up one day and say you know

[1:41:35] you said okay Daddy I'm glad you like me
[1:41:37] today I'm gonna be your son right and
[1:41:40] then a few days later here get up and
[1:41:42] say you know what I just don't feel like
[1:41:44] I'm I don't feel like
[1:41:47] I excuse me Ben am I still your
[1:41:50] son yes Peter you're still my son okay
[1:41:53] Daddy I'm in no he was his son before he
[1:41:57] was born come on come on church he was
[1:42:00] his son before he was born then there's
[1:42:03] nothing he can do to reverse what's
[1:42:06] already been done church are you hearing
[1:42:09] me it's easier amen for a mama to forget
[1:42:12] her suckling babe than for God to forget
[1:42:16] his ambassadors listen
[1:42:19] Hallelujah I may get in trouble here
[1:42:21] brother way but I'm going to say it
[1:42:23] America might forget their citizens and
[1:42:25] they might forget their soldiers when
[1:42:27] they withdraw from a country amen but
[1:42:29] when God Gets Ready Amen to take all of
[1:42:32] his ambassadors out of Leota they ain't
[1:42:35] going to be left behind they ain't going
[1:42:37] to be jumping on airplanes trying to
[1:42:39] catch a right out no they're going to
[1:42:41] know it's time to go because the mission
[1:42:45] has been
[1:42:48] accomplished yes sir are you hearing me
[1:42:51] they can only be recalled
[1:42:56] Brother David they can only be
[1:43:00] recalled by the king or the president
[1:43:04] who appointed
[1:43:09] them I like this one he has access to
[1:43:14] all the nation's
[1:43:17] wealth for the
[1:43:20] assignment so if he goes in his
[1:43:23] ambassador from America to Russia he
[1:43:25] don't go down there and get a loan from
[1:43:27] Russia to fulfill America's
[1:43:29] commission but the country that sends
[1:43:32] him come on church is the same country
[1:43:35] that will supply his every need now this
[1:43:38] is one I could preach on for about an
[1:43:40] hour he never speaks his personal
[1:43:43] position on any issue
[1:43:47] right he only says what the nation he
[1:43:51] has embody
[1:43:53] believes woo Glory I'll shout by myself
[1:43:58] in other words he never says something
[1:44:01] different than what's already been
[1:44:03] said on them tapes he never said come on
[1:44:08] Church come on Amen they never go as an
[1:44:11] ambassador and say well I think it's all
[1:44:13] right to wear shorts because that was
[1:44:16] just brother brandom's opinion no he
[1:44:18] embodies the kingdom that he is
[1:44:20] representing and he don't have a thought
[1:44:24] coming he don't have a thought coming
[1:44:27] the only thought he
[1:44:31] has is the one that's been given to him
[1:44:36] from the one that sent them he never
[1:44:41] speaks his personal position on any
[1:44:45] issue that's good that's good come on he
[1:44:48] never stands and says it's just too hard
[1:44:53] you know what he never does he never
[1:44:55] stands Brother David and says it can't
[1:44:58] be
[1:44:59] done he don't do that brother Joe he
[1:45:03] never stands and says it's
[1:45:05] impossible are you hearing me an
[1:45:08] ambassador never says that you know why
[1:45:11] because that's not the official position
[1:45:14] of the Kingdom that he's embodying the
[1:45:17] official position of the Kingdom that
[1:45:19] you're embodying is this nothing is imp
[1:45:23] possible with our God come on church he
[1:45:27] never stands there and says I can't
[1:45:29] overcome this that's not the official
[1:45:32] position the official position is
[1:45:35] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:45:40] is in the world what are you saying
[1:45:44] preacher I'm saying ambassadors they
[1:45:46] never speak their personal position are
[1:45:49] y'all ready for this their goal is to in
[1:45:52] uence the territory for their
[1:45:57] Kingdom their whole purpose in being
[1:46:01] there is to allow I'm I'm closing on
[1:46:04] this is to allow what is embodying
[1:46:08] them to
[1:46:10] influence what's around
[1:46:13] them young people God has
[1:46:17] invested his word in
[1:46:20] you but a word experience
[1:46:23] yeah the same way he did
[1:46:25] daniiel Daniel never became a citizen of
[1:46:29] Babylon come on
[1:46:31] Church Daniel never changed what he did
[1:46:35] in Babylon come on you remember they
[1:46:38] told him said don't
[1:46:40] pray but he was an
[1:46:42] ambassador so because he was an
[1:46:44] ambassador he didn't say okay I just I
[1:46:47] just won't pray I'll just I'll just I
[1:46:49] just I'll just go over here and pray in
[1:46:50] secret you know I want I mean I want
[1:46:52] holler and and and call on the God that

[1:47:10] I'm going to I'm going to get real quiet
[1:47:12] over here in the corner and I'm going to
[1:47:14] pray like a
[1:47:15] Babylonian well you won't pray cuz they
[1:47:17] was heathens and they didn't right
[1:47:20] that's right and if you start trying to
[1:47:21] go to church like aay of see you won't
[1:47:23] be there cuz half of them don't

[1:59:51] Jeremiah's message into his life and
[1:59:54] father in the time of
[1:59:56] captivity in the atmosphere of defeat in
[1:59:59] the middle of heathen worship and
[2:00:01] traditional gods and Idols Lord you had
[2:00:04] a young man named
[2:00:06] Daniel who stood there as a
[2:00:09] ambassador from the kingdom of God and
[2:00:12] testify to the word of God now father I
[2:00:15] believe I'm looking tonight at Young

[2:00:29] gathering around their lives and it's
[2:00:31] surrounding their minds father maybe not
[2:00:34] so much for the younger ones but the
[2:00:35] older ones in the teenage years Lord
[2:00:38] father going through high school and
[2:00:39] into college and different situations
[2:00:42] and Lord peer pressure begins to gather
[2:00:44] on them Father may they see that peer
[2:00:47] pressure is only coming because they're
[2:00:50] ambassadors they have been sent from the
[2:00:53] kingdom of light in the middle of
[2:00:55] darkness and father they are conducting
[2:00:59] themselves they are conducting
[2:01:02] themselves
[2:01:03] Hallelujah as
[2:01:05] ambassadors father I pray for strength
[2:01:08] upon them Lord I pray for your
[2:01:10] protection as the king of their lives
[2:01:12] upon them
[2:01:13] Lord father may you give them the grace
[2:01:16] Lord May the peer pressure Lord may it
[2:01:19] never push them into acting like the
[2:01:21] citizen of Le osia into acting like the
[2:01:24] children of Darkness into acting like
