========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] oh i [Music] [Music] around here [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one time [Music] [Applause] good job buddy how are you i'll tell you some of us good i'm glad to be here anyway i guess you know but uh if you would let's let's open our bibles if we would galatians 1 and we'll read the first six verses there i'd like to just talk for a moment about does god ever change his mind about his word i think we know the answer to that but just to go in you'll see down through the uh there's types and things there in the message where brother randall will take different places we'll take where bailey had come along and it seems that uh it seems that men have always tried to change the program of god and sometimes it's not bad men and we get down and go through here a little bit farther i guess we'll get to it but we see balaam there was actually a prophet of god a man of god brother bran talks highly about the man of god but he just listened he was following balak and stood of god as moses stayed with god balaam was going after balak and and after popularity and things of that nature so we'll just go on into the word here if we could for just a moment i'll try not to hold you long i put a timer tonight so i won't hold you long like last time galatians 1 and uh i think i said i'm sorry i said the first six verses uh we'll start with verse six i still get a little nervous i'm sorry i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preached any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed for do i now persuade men or god do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of a man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ and may the lord add his blessings to the word you may be seated will you go through this reading here and you'll see in that brother brandon we'll just go ahead and go on down with this in the church age book brother branham says here it is in galatians 1 8 though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be accursed it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people the original word could not change not even a dot or dash of it paul knew it was god who had spoken to him so he said even if i come and try to give a second revelation try to make one little change in what i gave originally let it be occurred paul himself the messenger to the age couldn't come back and change the word for the hour and see paul knew that the first revelation was correct so god can't give a first revelation then a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind and he cannot do that being god he said he'd give a revelation then add to it as he did in the garden of eden when he promised the seed to the woman and later designated that seed to come through abraham and then later said it would come by the same bloodlines in david but it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand see it is a progressive revelation but it can't change the revelation doesn't change the word of god our understanding can change god's word doesn't change and he says the word come on down the word can't change he said the seed came exactly as revealed and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word those ephesians knew that word as paul had taught it they were full of the holy ghost by the laying on of paul's hands they looked those false apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what paul said you are therefore false i tell you look at those false that false anointing doesn't ever stop it'll come right down into the message of the hour it'll teach something new i'll tell you you get into this message and you start to see what it really says and then you go listen to and not maybe not ministers maybe so much but uh you get out and you you see these guys they like their their what do they call them keyboard warriors yeah get online and they're so big you know sitting there on facebook or uh maybe they're got their own website and they're telling you how god has changed his ways he don't have preachers no more you know and he don't have uh he don't believe in the ministry and the pulpit no more i just say it like it is but god's word don't change it was said here recently i guess i'll just get myself in trouble might as well there was a man who said that that brother brandon stopped the five full ministry if he did that that would make him a false prophet he wasn't a false prophet right so when we say what the we say what the messenger of the hour says it's not because he come and changed something it's because he came with the word of the lord so when you see what what paul the apostle came and brother branham stayed with that word and the millions screamed out were resting upon it let me tell you something we are resting on the same promise that he stayed with the exact same word because god doesn't change his mind about his word he may change his mind about you you look at the king that asked for more years seven more years or however many years he asked for and he asked for these more years and god granted it to him and the prophet had to go back and tell him to change his mind and god had changed his mind but when it comes to the word of god he could not change his mind in order to be god and so we'll go on down here in the quote and he said he said there's going to come a prophet in the laodicean church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from god or not for he is of god he will be in that word exactly as god gave it to paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by why one excuse me one iota in that last stage when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost see the spirit of fear over the people [Music] but that last day prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you are lost he won't build on a private revelation or interpretation but on the word so when you hear these these prophets maybe they're true prophets they can be a prophet balaam was a prophet but when they come down and they try to point you to something new some new way of doing things that's not god speaking that's that's a man speaking and interpreting and twisting the word of god and brother branham goes on he says we'll kind of get the outline of the message first he said israel was in their journey coming from egypt he said the lord was with him every enemy that had raised up before israel was moved out of the way for god said he would set hornets before them it would drive out the enemy as long as they walked in obedience to his command the job was never too big the amalekites the giants of the day meant nothing to israel though they were small men in stature but they were walking and thus saith the lord so no matter what the opposition was god always seen that his words of promise had never failed israel and israel of the old testament is a type brother branham says here of the new testament coming up out of the world marching on the road to the millennium and he says we want what the god said at the beginning and anything added to it or taken away from it even your name will be taken off the book of life to add one word to it or take one word away from it and that's not us putting anybody out but that's the word of god staying in his purest form so many people let's say you gotta quote it exactly like it said but then they'll turn around and they'll try to make it say something completely different i'm here to tell you say what he said and it all come out right i i guess uh i was i've been around long enough around the different groups a little bit and they say press play and obey amen obey it do what he said see but the problem is we can sit and listen we can hear what he said but are we actually going to do what he said and that becomes a problem even the scriptures we can read this bible cover to cover and we can say amen to it up here never get it in our hearts we're only reading the pages as they're written we're not reading it with the heart of understanding and we're not actually applying it to our daily lives which that's why we fail so often and i and i'm not pointing fingers at anybody here that's that's me sometimes we have to really dig into that word really believe what it said and not just say we believe it with a head knowledge but actually get into it and believe the word of god with our whole hearts and then act on it he talked about the message hearing acting and receiving you hear the word you act upon it and i believe there's a there's a there's a time when it's okay maybe to sit and just hear the word of god but you have got to come to a point in life where you're ready to go put it in action what you've heard you now got to go do see and that's where i think a lot of times we we fail we stop the church stops you hear something you say i believe that but then you never go into it you never go forward in that in the progression of revelation and he says here he said anything attitude or taken away from it even your name will be taken off the book of life he said we want what thus saith the lord said what the word said but he talks about balaam here for just a moment he said a servant of god balaam many of those men start out and are ordained of god and speak god's word in many things but when it comes to the full truth they won't do it he said notice here as a prophet of god he should not have been caught in such a group as that to begin with he should have went with him but watch for popularity sex see for his conscience sake he said well stay all night i'll try again i'll try again what do you want to try again for he said god already told him what to say god said tell them what you're going that's his original word he said i'm not going and you and don't you go don't you curse what i blessed now watch how it backfired on him he said after a while he said every time he said when god says anything he means it he don't change his mind about it he stays right with his word no matter what anyone says he stays with his word if god ever told the church to get together and have church he still wants us to get together and have church god don't change his way of doing things he ever had a pastor he's still got pastors just because there's a false pastor doesn't mean that there's not a true pastor there's many false prophets going to rise in the last day it doesn't mean there wasn't a true prophet in the last day and that's where we get so caught up we're looking at the false and we see all the maybe the preachers that'll preach something wrong and you'll see a pastor maybe maybe they preach something that's just completely contrary to the word then you just try to put them all in one bunch well this pastor is wrong and that pastor is wrong this missionary or minister is wrong and then you just put them all together but that's not right because god always had a true true preacher in the bible he always had a true apostle in the bible and he said at any time if he ever healed a man at any time through the journey of life let it be in the days of jesus the apostles the prophets whatever it was when the same conditions is met he's got to do it again he doesn't change man changes time changes age changes dispensations change but god remains the same he said he is perfect what a hope that ought to give to sick people if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met if he ever saved a man how many saved here tonight if he ever saved one of you he's got to do it for somebody else what a hope that gives me the prophet said what i hope that gives me what is it not in some man-made theory not in something of groups of men have come together but is unchangeable word he's and he said you say is it the truth he said let every man's word be a lie and mind be true for heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail all scripture is given by inspiration therefore it's good and profitable for doctrine and he said remember all scripture will be fulfilled every bit of it he's the same god his word don't change amen if he ever if he ever called a man if he ever saved a man if he ever healed a man he could do it tonight you think of the situation take a sister hattie right she said that's nothing but the truth if we can get on that same condition to believe the word and say it's nothing but the truth god can save your lost children god can save your lost family no doubt through the holidays we had some family together that we're praying for but when we get together we get down to business with god god can take a mess and change it he did it in the days of jesus the woman at the well was there in a condition that if she walked in the church would we even accept her tonight but let me tell you you don't have to stay in the same condition because god's word can still take that mess and make something out of it he can still take a street prostitute and make her a daughter of god in the church he can still take somebody who's messed up their marriage and bring that marriage together don't let nobody tell you god's dead because he's still here and he's still doing miracles and i believe we can see him tonight he loved the lord tonight he's the same god he said if his word couldn't be changed by prophets we have no business messing with the word of god paul himself couldn't come an angel from heaven couldn't change the word of god and he said if another angel from heaven did come and try to change it let him be accursed a man may be a prophet a man may be a great preacher but if he tries to change the word of god you don't listen to him is that right because you go back to the word you remember the two prophets and my brother ben has spoke about this there was an old prophet that was sitting there and this young prophet was was sent and told to go to a certain place and he was told don't stop but continue on and this prophet this old prophet told the younger prophet come over and eat with me and the young prophet just out of i guess just just out of out of respect for the old prophet he stopped and he said and ate with him god didn't like that even though he listened to a prophet it wasn't according to the word that god told him to do and that's what we do now it seems like we're so caught up with maybe a personality or maybe because someone has a big name we think we got to hear what they say and that's good as long as they stay with the word of god once a man gets off the word of god you don't have to follow that man down that down that that false doctrine because god's word is true and and if i could stand up here and i might make a mistake and miss miss say a word or something you don't have to follow that or i might say something completely wrong if i got in the flesh for a moment or if i tried to preach in my own words but if god can come and god can vindicate what he said by bringing it to pass it's not me that's vindicated it's the word of god that's vindicated it's not some man-made theology but it's the word of god preaching the power and the demonstration of the holy ghost i think tonight god can still use a man he can still use a woman just as he did in the bible days because i don't believe when the final chapter was written that god died with that i believe that was the time when god said god said i'll raise up a people and they'll do the same thing that didn't stop with our prophet he didn't come just to do all the miracles for himself he come to show god was still alive then so that we can know that god's still alive now god doesn't stop with a certain man passes off the scene but his spirit always remains upon the church if we can just get ourselves in that position to take on the spirit of christ instead of instead of each other's spirits maybe or maybe instead of our pastor or someone else always trying to be like somebody but maybe if we can just get in tune with that holy spirit then we can cast out devils in his name we can raise the dead in his name nothing is impossible with god and we are part of his word we're eternal beings when god saw us in the beginning he knew where we'd be sitting right now and he knew there'd be sickness among us he knew there would be all kinds of problems in this day but he knew we'd be here why because we're his hands we're his feet we are the body of christ in this day don't let nobody tell you you're not good enough don't let nobody tell you that god is dead and god doesn't use the five-fold ministry anymore god still has a five-hole on the earth many is going to fall away many will leave we don't follow after that we follow the word of god but there will be a bride and there will be a many-membered body that will stay true to the word of god and everything that he says can i get an amen some say we don't need the preachers we don't need the church show me where god's word did away with it brother branham never stopped it how are we going to stop it messenger of the age couldn't stop it worse you're not going to stop it i believe here that brother branham when he ordained these ministers he didn't do it just just to do it he did it because he knew that there would need to be ministers to carry on the message of the hour we god can't change the written word and he's not going to change his spoken word and a prophet that would come and say anything contrary to that is not a true prophet if that doesn't that doesn't say it doesn't say that they're i'm not trying to point anybody out but but church we got to come to a point where it doesn't matter what anybody says it doesn't matter what any i don't care how big they are how big their name is it just don't matter what they say if it's not god's word we stay with the word regardless if it's us two us three that's it be the one be the two be those that stay with the word of god brother branham came he came with no ministry of his own he came with a message from the king how many knows that to show christ was still alive the very theme of his campaign jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the yesterday that walked the earth the same today when he was here on earth and forever that's where we're at now he's still the same god man will change groups will change there'll be doctrines come and there'll be private revelations and interpretations but god's word will never change regardless of all the fanaticism god's word doesn't change there'll be there'll be all kinds of false things that might arise on the scene but god's word still remains the same stay with it the first eve fell why did she fall she left part of the word but he said this second eve this bride would not fall she won't fall why because she'll stay with the word of the hour she'll stay with every word that bride she'll scream out we're resting on it why because we've we've read it we've taken this message we've read our bibles we understand that this prophet didn't come with his own message but he preached exactly what the bible said it only come to open it up to where we could actually see what the word says and we just want to stay into the word stay in the truth no matter what any pastor would say stay with the word no matter what any prophet would say stay with the word brother branham goes on like this he said i want to say this that god never changed his mind his direct will was for balaam not to go but when god makes a statement it has to ever remain true the bible said jesus christ the same yesterday and forever he said that don't mean in a certain way that means he's the same yesterday today and forever he said in saint john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also he said is that right he promised in mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe they say well that was just for the apostles he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them and all the world to every creature in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it wouldn't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover he said now that is his qualification it's not a man's qualification that's his qualification according to the word he said see we try to qualify something we're trying to make qualify the church to what we think god's word is we can't qualify to the church we've got to qualify to god and we know god is his word we go on here brother said heavens and earth will pass away my word shall never pass away what the palmer worm has left has the caterpillar eaten there's something wrong somewhere he said because god's word is just as eternal as he is eternal god's word can no more fall then god can fall himself he said there's something wrong somewhere so let's go back now the background we have laid he said let's go back and take our text of romans 3 4 let every man's word be alive god be true he said i'm going to drive this down and he said i want you to listen let it be god truth let's line up with what god said regardless of what anybody else said he said i want to use four different things he uses four things here in the scripture the insects has eaten off the church of the living god he said the vine of god has crippled or stunted because of these things he said you pentecostals you nazarene you all admit the tabernacle here admits there's something wrong and we the tabernacle is just as guilty as the rest for he that knoweth to do good and do not do it to him it's sin he said now let's go back he said i want to name four things just the scripturals i know how to be that these insects is eaten from the church he said now the first thing the church has was established on the day of pentecost peter preached the inauguration sermon he said when the church was born the christian church was born in the day of pentecost he said if god is infinite and cannot change his church must remain as it was at the beginning he said do you admit that we can say amen to that the church must ever remain the same as it was but man has tinkered with it put their own interpretations in it he said don't you ever try to interpret the word of god say just what it says he said i don't care how it is just line it up with that he said that's all don't change the word the bible said that scripture is not of any private interpretation he said we have no right to say these things we just got to read it and say it just exactly like it says he said and believe it the same way he said i don't care how ridiculous it seems believe it anyhow and he goes on and he talks about the different things that would canker the church he calls it crippling the body of christ in this sermon palmer worm locus cankerwoman caterpillar he talks about how these things will eat at the church little false doctrines little ideas little isms will form in the church he said these things would destroy the church of god not the church of god but with the church in the church you might say the people that claim to be part of the bride of christ it'll sit there and they'll make up little isms and doctrines and they'll go off on this limb over here and then follow after this over here but the truth of it is if you could ever meet god on the requirements of his word then you'll meet him in a place where you can't even you don't even want to go into those other places you don't want to take these little ideas and isms and go off on these things you want to stay with the word of god why because it brings life to the church the word of god is not a dead letter but it brings life back in the church it'll make you shout it might make you scream a little bit it might make you do something crazy in church why because you're excited over the word of god it's not just some emotional workup it's not beating the drums and trying to work somebody up but it's the word of god that brings life and if we can stay true to the word of god i don't believe that satan can even come in and sit here through a whole service where the god word of god is being preached i think he could sit there he might say amen to the word because he knows it's true but he'll sit there and i'll tell you what he might sit there and he will he i've heard a brother say he's the best christian he's god he's there every time the doors are open but let me tell you something we're burning this hide every time we're preaching he gets mad at us when we get up here and preach why because he wants to change just something little he don't mind if you stay home from church he don't mind that at all he don't mind if he said at home and don't fellowship because he said that's when brother brahm talks about he said that's when uh he said that's when you get off to yourself he said that's when the wolf will go after the sheep when they're off by themselves [Music] just remember that you get off by yourself think you're too good to go to the house of god what happens satan will come in there and he'll try to work on your mind and the next thing you know he'll have you in such a condition that everybody at the church is against you yeah you're too good to go to church but apparently the people at the church are too good to have you there and so you're just in this condition to where we satan just works on your mind so much that's his job it's the battle of the mind brother bram said the greatest battle ever thoughts right here in the mind this is the battleground where satan will come and he'll tell you just just leave this little word here you don't have to go to church to be saved maybe you don't but a christian will be a church see we don't put our salvation in anything except for the blood of christ but once you've accepted the blood once you've come under the atonement then you'll your desires will change the life that is in you will want to line up with the life of christ and every time that god has ever sent a his spirit upon the church there's been a revival break out in the people and it was because they were according to the word when when when the pentecostal blessing fell on the church is because they gathered as they were supposed to and they did things exactly according to the word and they waited there they tarried there until the word of god and the power fell upon because they were acting according to the word and if we can act according to the word of god tonight the same god and pentecost can be here with us tonight why because we we just get to thinking we think too much sometimes about ourselves and how hard it is how much of a struggle it is to go to church it is sometimes especially if you got kids sometimes it's hard to go to church it's hard to get him up and get ready devil won't fight you on the other days but he'll fight you on sunday for sure and he'll make it just to where it's so hard but if you'll just push on through that thing take god as at his word just watch how god will move in there and he'll take that trial and he'll make it into something good for you you might might be the best service you've ever been in if you'll just push your way and go and if it's not satan will sit there and tell you see you shouldn't have went you didn't get nothing out of it all they had was a kid up there preaching but if you'll just listen to the word of god god will do something for you and what happens is we get to a point we let satan beat us over the head we let him just get us in such a place we get depressed and we get the feeling like everybody's against us go back to the word of god the word of god i'll tell you it'll it'll soothe every doubt it'll calm it'll calm your soul if you just listen i was sitting there last night and i was listening to a message and and i just got so lost into it my wife had to come tell me it's late it's after midnight you need to probably go to bed you know but you get into that and sometimes it's just so relaxing just to hear the word of god knowing that that's the word of god for you it's not for any other age it's for you and we take that word and we take it and we can just take it in our hearts and and we can act upon it and we hear something and we just say amen to it and sometimes our hearts will just leap for joy when we hear something that we really need to hear it and we just want to get that way about the word you know we get so excited i'm not a hunter but sometimes people get so excited about hunting season and i guess i would too if i was a hunter you know and maybe football or basketball something gets you excited but i think if we could ever get that excitement about the word of god i think god would really move among our services i think god could move in our lives on everyday life if we would just really just you know god inhabits the praises of his people you say i don't feel it praise him he'll be there he'll show up praise him a little bit god will inhabit the praises of his people that's the word and his word don't fail and if his word don't fail why not just step out and claim the promises of god there's no reason for us to be beat down there's no reason for us to to feel like that everything's against us because if nothing else god's on our side if we'll stay with the word of god the test will come the trials will come every son that ever comes to god is going to be tested and tried that's the word but you come anyway you don't come because you don't come because you're looking for some flowery bed of ease as brother branham called it you don't look because it's not a picnic this is a battle it's a battlefield it sure is and it's not going to be easy at times but when you just get into that word you'll have you'll have a rebuttal for every tactic that satan will come with and he'll change his tactics because a lot of times we'll we'll understand that this is satan doing this to us and we'll learn take the word and we'll block that out but he'll come in another way and he'll try to stop you just every and it'll be so subtle sometimes that we won't even catch on and we'll go down and in our lives we'll let something go and we'll let something go i've been there in my life you just let something go i can slip out on a wednesday night every once in a while it's not it's not too easy the first time because you figured well they know i'm not there you know and i'm not talking about people to drive i know when i went to church i couldn't drive from hot springs up here on wednesday night so so i'll give myself an out there but uh but see but if you can if there's a possibility to go we should obey the word of god at all cost and whatever we have to do to be in the position to be able to obey the word of god we don't want anything to hinder us we don't want to work to hinder us we don't want our we don't want to get to a point we're just so busy with our everyday lives we can't go to church because that is an interference with god the devil might like that the devil's going to love that because if he can keep you out of the house of god sure he might make you even very successful to keep you out of the house of god but is it worth it everything you see here is going to perish anyway but there's something down deep inside of a person something in the soul of a man if you could ever get that word anchored in your heart then god will come down and he'll he'll just make such an anchor in your soul and there'll be something in there that'll really get a hole you grab a hold of that word and take hold of it nothing can keep you away from the word of god nothing can keep you from claiming his promises why because god is still god and his word don't change and when you feel the presence of god and i believe this if a man can ever get in the presence of god he'll never be the same again if you could ever get in a channel where god can come down and anoint your life with the holy ghost you can never be out of you can never go too far again because when you try to go god's gonna grab a hold of you he's gonna bring you back to him why because you've accepted him on the faces of his word and if god has ever if god has ever got a hold of your life and it's not us holding god we know that but when god can hold on to you like that you may try to run i don't believe you can if you're a seed of god i don't believe you can go too far you say well it looks like they've they just went too far they've crossed the line if they're a seed of god don't worry about it maybe we don't know if they're seed of god you pray for them you do all these things you try to reach a hand out to people but god's word is true if he ever called someone he's not going to lose them if he ever called them and predestinated them before the foundation of the world if their names are on the book of life he won't lose a one of them i believe that tonight that god's word is still true this morning the pastor was preaching and he was going on and talking about the same holy ghost same holy ghost is still here tonight we don't always feel it like we want to but it's still here we don't go by feeling sometimes we feel like it we feel like heaven's brass and we pray and we don't get an answer god's still there and in his time he's going to answer your prayers in his time he's going to step out and grab a hold of that child that backslid we just as humans sometimes we get impatient there's times i ask god for things in life and then you know i look back on it i think it's probably a good thing he didn't give it to me maybe i wouldn't be able to handle it at the time sometimes he gives us little trials you know test us and see if we're how we're going to react to it are we going to run we're going to just leave the word and say it's too hard to live a christian life it puts me in mind a little story uh brother branham was was preaching and or no it wasn't brother brandon preaching a man was up preaching and he said he's talking about brother brandon's message and he was going on there and he said there's only one problem with brother brandon's message he said nobody can live it a little man in the back stood up he said the bride can and i believe if we can ever get to that point we know that we can live it not by our works not our own merits not because we're good because god has put something in us we're going to fight we're not going to give up we're going to stay on this battlefield why because it's worth it it's worth going all the way it's worth not giving up it's worth grabbing a hold of the promises of god you say well so and so they died with cancer they were a christian it was their time to go but god can still heal cancer and not only can he he will thank you and that's where we have to come to we get so discouraged sometimes we're looking at circumstances you matt you talk about circumstances think about job not you but the other job job he sat there i mean he lost what ten thousand sheep in a day seven thousand camels some number like that that's discouraging that'd be rough he's a wealthy man and he's losing it all losing his wealth and then he lost his ten children and every time a messenger would come running to him the messenger would come the bad news at some point you think job just don't let any more come to you run off go hide somewhere every time these messengers have come well your camels are dead your sheep are dead now your children are gone his wife told him curse god and die look like he ought to give up but he held on to a promise of god because he knew the word was true he didn't even have the understanding that we have in this day and yet he could live through all those trials in this day we've seen god prove himself we've seen god manifest himself time and time again and yet we still seem to get so tossed about by a little trial here and something that will come up over here and i'll tell you church some of you been through things that i maybe i wouldn't be able to handle god knows how much you can handle how much he can allow things to come upon you but i tell you if you'll hold on to the word of god god will not let you go too far if you've got a child that's went so far you think they're gone god won't let them go too far if they're one of his so we rest in the assurance of god we rest in the promises of god we stay in the word of god why because god's word still remains the same he won't change you say you're repeating yourself a lot if we could ever get into our minds that god's word never changes we can really get somewhere because these these false prophets that might be all over the place would come and they say well well this was false and this was wrong you won't even pay no mind to him because you're settled that the word of god is true regardless you're settled it and you know there are good men balaam was such a man he was a good man brother better say he's a man of god a prophet of god he called him yeah but what happened to balaam he just got pulled by the wrong influences he didn't even mean to be that way balaam didn't want to go out and be false he even went down tried to curse the people couldn't do it god still spoke brother said god spoke through balaam god still spoke and god also spoke through a donkey so he can speak through me too god can speak through anybody but when it comes down to it it don't matter who is speaking it if it's not the word it's wrong if it's the word it's right i don't care who's speaking if it's god's word it's true if it's wrong i don't care if a pope or priest or bishop or some prophet is speaking it if they're speaking something contrary to the word of god you always go back to the word of god no matter what comes no matter what tries to influence you in a certain way god's word is the same let me move on down here before i run out of time james 1 22 be doers of the word and not hears only deceiving your own selves we can hear the word we can read the word good things we can listen to the word we have that benefit in our day we need to nothing wrong with that but to do that is just not enough to just sit to sit here in the church i'll take it a little farther sit here and hear your pastor every service that's not enough you can sit there and you say well good sermon good job maybe you can even feel the anointing of the holy ghost upon your flesh but if you go home and live any kind of life then it's not changing you it's just you're just feeling good you feel like i'm going to church i'm i'm you can even do that you can do that for years and maybe you could be content in that state but if you've never grabbed hold of the word of god and acted upon the word of god then what's wrong with church what's happened is that we've just gotten ourselves in a lot of seeing condition a lukewarm condition i'm going to church now i've done a little more i'm kind of doing what the word said but then we get home and we don't live any kind of a christian life why because we wanted we want to fit in we want to fit in with the church people we like the social status but when we get off to ourselves are you still believing the word of god are you still acting on the word at that point if there was no church to go to could you still be a christian could you still believe the word of god if if the churches were shut down they were a little bit there most of our churches were shut down did you sit at home and sit in your pjs with some popcorn and turn on t.d jakes or did you sit there and you just in your heart you wanted to be a church see that's there's there it is it's in the heart a lot of times in the flesh we judge a man by the flesh and how they respond a lot of times and and if you could ever get that word of god in the heart things will change your life will change nothing's going to stop you from going forward in the in the lord if you'll just grab a hold of his promises stay true to the word of god i'll bring this down here we don't follow man-made ideas we may not all see exactly the same glasses we don't see some people have different shades on you may be walking in a time in life where you see a little different revelation that maybe i see i'm young there's men that man they speak something i i'm not gonna go against it unless unless it was just contrary to the word i'll just let it be because they've been in the message so long and you're like they they're so far advanced maybe in revelation than what i could be but you don't just take it just because they're old don't take what they say take everything back to the word of god sometimes we respect an elder we'll respect a man so much you want to just grab hold of everything they say you want to amend everything they say and sometimes that's it's good if they're just preaching the word of god and that's great we should we should always back the word of god that's the cue for you you should always say man to the word of god but see you don't have to just if you're something you're little you're not sure on it don't say amen to that step back and check it with the word it's okay to do that it's okay to filter it's okay to filter a man it's okay to put your filter on even a prophet now we can look back and we've filtered we've already taken our prophet to the bible and we've already seen that he was true so sometimes you can take that off but when you've got another man you say well he's got a gift of a prophet i don't have to filter that be careful you follow a balaam and not know it see and that's where the church gets in a we get in a this condition we get lazy we get lacks and we don't really want to even check it with the word anymore we don't care to check it with the word anymore we must stay with the word and i do believe that it's not just about the emotion but i believe the word will bring a spirit upon the church of love and unity i believe that god will bring a spirit upon the church of rejoicing and joy in the church i do believe that because i don't believe you can sit and listen service after service to the word of god and something not grab a hold of you if you can do that you might want to check up maybe it's time for the altar at that point be like lord make me anew refill me with the holy ghost as our pastor preached this morning i don't care that i received the holy ghost at one time in my life i need it again i need more of god than i did yesterday because satan's more real now he's just as real now as he ever was he'll have a new tactic tomorrow but we should be so prayed up and so into the word of god that when we get out of bed in the morning that we're just ready to face the devil we know he's coming don't lay down and take it get up and fight and i think a lot of times even good christians we get we just get so down and defeated but we shouldn't let the devil do that don't let him steal your joy don't let him steal your peace the word of god is so true if you'll follow after the word of god if you'll get into that word of god hear it receive it and act upon it god can change your life he not only can but he will change your life if you'll just believe the word of god don't let nobody stop you from staying with the word don't matter who it is just don't let nobody ever get you away from the word of god we need to just always stay with the word matthew 24 35 heaven and earth shall pass away my words shall not pass away his words are as eternal as he is the prophet of god tells us and you are part of the word you are an eternal being this is just a space and time to where satan is allowed to fight us and satan is allowed to come at us with all these little tactics and these little darts and i'll tell you it's time the church just really stands up and we quit taking it because there's a there's a saying going around and i like it we're made out of stuff that don't bluff and i think that's the way the church of god needs to be tonight if we could ever get in tune with god get in a place where god can move upon the scene and he can change the outcome of things he can make you in such a way he can make you so powerful over your enemy that when satan comes and he tries to hit you satan will back up and say wow that guy's been on his knees that person's been in prayer they've been listening to the word of god and they've been doing more than listen to it they're acting on it they've put it into action and if that action could ever get a hold and if we can ever get a hold and take that action and just really go with it and run and get in action with the word of god i believe this church can be on so much fire for god that i believe people will come and see what's going on down here every church should get into that atmosphere i believe if we can ever get into the channel of the right atmosphere we won't be comfortable coming to church and just sitting still i believe we'll get into a channel to where god will move so much in our lives i tell you what it's like going to a ball game i went one time and if i sit there i'll tell you something you feel awkward when you're just sitting there yeah everybody's screaming and shouting they're drunk i went in wisconsin they're really drunk hey people i mean it's bad it's fun but it's bad but i got to thinking i did i sit there and i guess you've been raised in church too much when you're sitting at a ball game thinking about church you're sitting there thinking why can't we get this excited we couldn't even see what was going on down on the field we had no idea who caught the ball until the announcer said first down or third down or whatever it was we had no idea what was going on yeah but everybody was on their feet anyway i'll never forget this one i'm sorry i'm down i'm down a rabbit hole here the old man sitting there he's sitting there and he's so grumpy i don't know what he's doing the ball game had no business being there he was sitting right in front of me and they don't have seats like normal stadiums there and they had these bleachers and my knees were in his back i guess and i guess i should have stood up and i'd have made him happy but i sat there my knees in his back and he turned around he said get your knees out my back so i try and i back up and somebody's pushing me forward and people standing up you smell the beer everywhere you know it's like people are excited about this you know how you watch it on tv it's a lot easier don't do that anyway but you get yourself see i don't know where i'm going hang with me for a second i'm coming back but they get so excited over something that has zero meaning they lost that game it's the only loss of the year for the packers at home and i was there people were defeated when they left they'd all been standing up screaming the whole game now they can't talk they're staggered as they walk out yeah there's nothing good come out of it there was nothing good i mean there was no there's no value you might have had fun for a couple hours but you go home and now you're mad you're mad at the refs mad at the quarterback through an interception you're just mad you didn't do nothing good wait in traffic for two hours and all the drugs driving it don't do you no good there's no value in it you come to church there's value in coming what you hear there's value in doing it if that don't excite you then i don't know what will i thought maybe we ought to throw footballs in church maybe that'd excite the people or if they sit real still knock them out with them that's right bless him lord we've got to come to a point where we enjoy our salvation and i believe it comes to a point it comes to a point where we get so caught up in these things of the world and steals our joy from the holy spirit we get to think and i tell you what you get this thing on your mind you you know maybe maybe your work or or maybe you're trying to buy a house or maybe you're trying to buy a new car and you think about it you just overthink it and it tries to steal your joy and you know that's all satan maybe go pray about it before you do it maybe it'll help you maybe you still make a stupid decision you might it's not god's fault if you do but what we've got to come to the realization of is that god's word remains the same regardless of how our father or mother treated us or how our brothers or our sisters were treated sometimes the brothers treat you bad real bad don't matter stay with the word anyway stay with the truth of anyone i mean you just got to come back down come back to the word of god and i believe in the word is where we'll find happiness contentment joy we can shout a little bit when when when the spirit moves among us we should have the freedom it doesn't mean you have to jump and shout and scream all the time i mean that i've been to churches where you couldn't hear nothing the preacher said you left and you felt really good but you really had no idea what was said but there should be a joy when the word goes forth and when the spirit of the lord comes upon the people there should be such an expectation from you to receive the word that when it comes forth and it blesses your heart you should be able to stand up and say amen you ought to be able to stand up and shout why because god's word is moving upon your heart and when and as the pastor said almost said the prophet said as the pastor said this morning you know when when when mary conceived there wasn't much emotion but when she gave birth she knew she gave birth because when a birth happens there's going to be something take place and i believe when that when we come in and we get that feeling of the holy ghost something's going to grab hold of us and we may not feel it immediately but we've we've gotten the holy ghost and we change as he was saying this morning and then we go on and we get that refilling but i believe as you get more soft and you get more maybe your heart is hardened at some time in your life and you kind of really let your heart just soften up to the things of god i believe god can then really move in your life and i believe maybe it'll make you cry you say well i'm embarrassed to cry in church i'm embarrassed to shout in church quit thinking about those around you and praise god anyway it don't do you any good we don't come we come to fellowship with each other but you don't come to to hope so and so gets blessed i mean you want everybody to get blessed but you don't come and your salvation doesn't depend on the person next to you and neither should you're shouting you stand up do i have a wrinkle in the back of my suit do i sit on some gum shouldn't have the gum anyway we get so carnal we get so caught up in our little personality quirks i guess you might say we're just scared to take god at his word and step out on it why because we get so we get so battered with life we get so beat up and all these things just come against us what happens we just get beat down and we feel like we can't praise god no more the devil don't like no praising god around here i don't care what the devil don't like brother stewart i don't care what the devil don't like we should praise god with all of our might we should praise him with everything in us when we get up in the morning praise god anyway and i'm going to skip through some of these because i've taken too much time my football story got out of hand it's time to take god at his word and get in action this one let me read this to you real quick and we'll bring it to a close brother brown was talking here he said moab seen israel something they didn't have they seen a mighty power amongst israel it was a prophet he said that prophet was moses he said and they know that when the battle went wrong they just raised up his hands held them up there and the battle changed i like that hold up your hands sometimes you've got that same power in you so that was just moses no that christ is in you there's power in raising up your hand there's power and when you say amen to the word of god he said they didn't held his hands up there and the battle changed he said they didn't have such as that so he said they try to match it with politics with a political pull he said they sent over to another country and hired a prophet to come over he said they could have a prophet would have power amongst them just like israel had among them he said do you see the carnal comparison can you see the carnal church today it's done the very same thing he said notice now they're both going to have prophets the only difference was moses the prophet of god his king was god and that's where he got his orders the word of the lord balaam he also he had a king and that king was balak the king of moab he said that's where he got his orders and his or and his blessings so moab said to balak come down or balaam said come down and curse me this people for they cover the whole face of the earth they just come and lick up everything like an ox licks up the grass said come down here and i understand that you can curse you can bless whatever you do is recognized that's true whatever he was a prophet what he did was was thought highly of in this time but he was hired he wasn't sin of god he said now we want to notice that this man was a prophet ordained of god but he sold his birthrights for political reasons just as the church did today like luther wesley pentecost and the whole group of them sold it out for polls in their organization moses under god balaam under balak yet both prophets were called man of god both spiritual notice the difference each had a head moses was god balaam's was balak he said notice here how the spiritual is applied to prove that the natural is wrong moses sent of god in line of duty is met and challenged by another prophet of god he said can you imagine that moses called of god ordained of god standing in the duty of god moved up into this cold formal group and was challenged by another prophet of god what god had blessed and ordained how would you tell the difference now listen to this they both had prophets god spoke to both prophets and i just love how he takes this down here he said some of them say well god said do this god said do that he said i don't question that but it's out of the line of god's word the prophet no matter if he is a prophet he's out of line he said so many people get deceived like that he said oh this brother can do this and this brother can do that and deny the word he said though i speak with tongue of men and angels though i have gifts that i can move mountains though i give all my goods to feed the poor i am yet nothing church we don't follow after another person the word of god christ jesus that's the person we follow and he is the word and that word has come down as musicians would come i'll be closing here and as this word would come down and just penetrate the heart if we'll just really grab a hold of that word god is really god can do something for you he can move on your life we don't follow after a false prophet this message that we've gotten we hold so dear to is a vindicated word message of the hour it's all true stay with it hold your hands up in the hour of struggle and tribulation and times of trial hold your hands up to god praise him anyway as i said god inhabits the praises of his people when you get beat down praise god tell him lord i don't know what you got planned for me in my life but i'm going to serve you anyway i don't care how bad it seems i'm going to praise god anyway i don't care i don't care who would persecute me or come against me i'm going to praise him anyway don't let satan beat you down stay with the word of god stay true to the word of god if we could stand and play something there take god at his word how many in the building tonight is ready to step out on the challenge and take god at his word don't listen to the fables don't listen to nonsense that would come in that would be contrary to the word of god it might tickle your ear it might it might make you feel good but if it's not the word of god leave it alone it's time we stand firm on the word of god and when that word of god will really when it really comes into us we become part of that word and that word will manifest in our lives it'll make something good happen you may not look good now you may not feel good now hold on to the word of god stay true to the word of god god won't fail his word won't fail you people fail you men will fail you good times come good times go but god remains the same lord just reach out and touch him tonight church if you have a need if you need something from god tonight he's still here you say i don't feel i don't feel him on me right now that's time for another baptism of the holy ghost it's time to get a re-baptism on
