[3:28] ahead and get it out of the woods now i
[3:31] believe this message with everything
[3:34] that is within me the message
[3:37] changed my life i i uh started out i'd
[3:42] never been to church a day in my life
[3:44] i'd never went to uh i told the saints
[3:47] last night i went to one pizza party at
[3:50] a baptist church when i was 10 years old
[3:53] and outside of that i'd never been a
[3:55] church a day in my life
[3:57] until
[3:58] until i came into this message and
[4:00] that's been 24 years ago i've never seen
[4:04] anything that i thought was better
[4:08] when i when i came into this message i
[4:10] stopped looking brothers and sisters and
[4:13] and uh uh i you know people talk all the
[4:16] time about i guess there's kind of a
[4:17] thing going around about you know
[4:19] whether uh uh the the the bridge uh
[4:23] vision of the bridge was right and
[4:25] whether this i don't look at any of that
[4:28] what i'm looking at is is the word of
[4:30] god vindicated
[4:32] in our day and brothers and sisters this
[4:35] message
[4:36] has been tried and trued
[4:39] there's no i haven't found one iot of it
[4:42] that i couldn't hang my soul on
[4:44] and so that's what i i'm not looking at
[4:46] the miracles that's the bait on the hook
[4:48] i'm looking at what the word of god said
[4:51] amen and i feel so
[4:54] good tonight when i walked into church
[4:56] when we walked in that door is that the
[4:59] i got lost at the front door is that the
[5:00] front door there
[5:02] when i walked in that door
[5:04] uh i just felt i felt the spirit of god
[5:06] here and i felt good to be here and so
[5:09] uh i'm i'm just relaxed and happy to be
[5:11] with you all so if we could let's turn
[5:14] our bibles to first samuel
[5:17] first samuel the
[5:19] uh 30th chapter if you just stand
[5:24] while we read the word of god
[5:29] first samuel the 30th chapter we'll read
[5:32] uh the first
[5:35] six verses or so
[5:36] for a little text tonight
[5:39] very very familiar scripture
[5:45] first samuel
[5:48] 30 1-6 and it came to pass when david
[5:52] and his men were come to ziklag on the
[5:54] third day
[5:56] that the amalekites had invaded the
[5:58] south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and
[6:01] burned it with fire
[6:03] and had taken the women captive that
[6:06] were therein
[6:07] they slew not any either great or small
[6:10] but carried them away
[6:13] and went on their way so david and his
[6:15] men came to the city and behold it was
[6:18] burned with fire
[6:20] and their wives and their sons and their
[6:23] daughters were taken captive
[6:26] then david and the people that were with
[6:28] him lifted up their voice and wept
[6:31] until they had no more power to weep
[6:37] and saints unless you've been there you
[6:38] don't know what that scripture's talking
[6:40] about
[6:42] but there comes a time in your life
[6:43] where the trials are so great
[6:46] and the burdens are so heavy
[6:49] and the times are so tough
[6:52] that you just cry until you can't cry no
[6:55] more
[6:58] until they had no more power to weak and
[7:00] david's two wives were taken captives
[7:03] anonymous and the jezreelitis and
[7:05] abigail the wife of nabal the
[7:07] camelite and david was greatly
[7:10] distressed for the people spake of
[7:13] stoning him because the soul of the
[7:15] people was grieved every man for his
[7:18] sons and for his daughters but david
[7:22] encouraged
[7:23] himself
[7:25] in the lord his god
[7:28] let's just bow our heads heavenly father
[7:31] what a beautiful passage of scripture
[7:33] lord
[7:35] lord how
[7:37] grateful we are
[7:40] that it's you tonight that's our
[7:42] encouragement lord
[7:44] that it's you tonight that we lean on
[7:47] lord that you're the rock in the weary
[7:49] land you're the shelter in the time of
[7:51] storm
[7:52] you're our sufficiency lord you're all
[7:55] in all
[7:56] and father i just pray that you would
[7:58] help me tonight lord bless this service
[8:01] bless these wonderful people
[8:03] lord the bride of jesus christ standing
[8:05] before me tonight
[8:07] lord don't take it lightly
[8:10] that i have the privilege of speaking to
[8:12] your bride
[8:13] and now lord i just pray that you would
[8:16] lord
[8:16] speak through me lord move me out of the
[8:19] way
[8:20] bind my lips before i'd speak anything
[8:22] unpleasing to you and we'll give you the
[8:24] praise and honor in the name of the lord
[8:26] jesus christ and the bride said amen
[8:29] amen and you can be seated and we'll
[8:32] take a little text tonight of encourage
[8:34] yourself in the lord if you just keep
[8:37] your bibles there to
[8:39] first samuel the 30th chapter uh we'll
[8:42] just stay right in first samuel the 30th
[8:46] chapter tonight just kind of a little
[8:48] sunday evening bible study if you will
[8:50] how many of you love your bible amen do
[8:52] y'all believe the bible for our day as
[8:54] well amen amen
[8:57] we've got the written word and the
[8:58] spoken word but it doesn't change the
[9:00] written word does it right amen
[9:03] amen it's the it's the it's the
[9:06] it's it's it's the front sight and the
[9:08] rear side of the gun amen
[9:12] and so we find now in our text of david
[9:15] here uh just a little background before
[9:18] we get started first off david
[9:21] you find
[9:23] was a man on the run
[9:25] and david had spent a lot of time
[9:28] running
[9:29] and he'd been running
[9:30] and he'd been running from sauls
[9:32] everybody read your bible you know that
[9:34] that he that that saw and sought his
[9:36] life and saul had been after him and and
[9:38] david finally said i'm gonna perish at
[9:40] the hand of saul and so david moved
[9:43] himself
[9:45] across from his land onto enemy grounds
[9:49] and brothers and sisters we got to be so
[9:51] careful not to go out on the devil's
[9:54] grounds
[9:55] we got to stay
[9:57] on our grounds
[9:59] amen i i believe in getting sinners to
[10:01] the lord but they got to come with us we
[10:03] don't go with them
[10:05] amen
[10:06] so so david had first mistake that he
[10:08] made was getting out on the devil's
[10:11] grounds and david had moved across
[10:14] and he moved across into the philistine
[10:17] country and he was basically had made
[10:19] himself a mercenary for a philistine
[10:22] king
[10:23] and so we find that david brothers and
[10:26] sisters was fighting
[10:28] the wrong battle
[10:35] he wasn't just fighting
[10:37] he wasn't just fighting the enemy he was
[10:39] fighting his own people and saints will
[10:42] never get nowhere fighting our own
[10:45] people
[10:47] we'll never get nowhere
[10:49] tearing each other down
[10:51] we'll never get nowhere fighting amongst
[10:54] brothers and sisters of like precious
[10:56] faith
[10:59] god didn't call us to be mercenaries for
[11:02] the devil
[11:03] he didn't call us to attack one another
[11:06] he didn't call us to attack other
[11:08] churches
[11:09] yes sir he calls to live the life saints
[11:13] live the life before the people
[11:18] he didn't give us the message to
[11:20] memorize
[11:21] he gave us the message to internalize
[11:25] it's not something we do it's a life we
[11:28] live
[11:29] see if you're in the message you don't
[11:30] just come to church on wednesday and
[11:32] come to church on sunday
[11:35] it's it's a life you live every day
[11:41] and so we never get nowhere
[11:43] fighting against god's people
[11:46] and that's exactly the situation david
[11:49] found himself in fighting against god's
[11:54] people and it's wow
[11:57] he was fighting
[12:00] with god's people
[12:03] that the enemy
[12:05] crept into his home
[12:12] and the minute we keep our mind
[12:15] on our brothers and sisters we keep our
[12:17] mind on the things of the world we keep
[12:19] our mind on other churches we keep our
[12:22] mind on what's going on on facebook
[12:26] the enemies creeping into our homes
[12:28] brothers and sisters
[12:30] and when david
[12:31] come back to his home
[12:33] he found it in shambles
[12:35] he found it in ruin he found it
[12:37] destroyed
[12:40] come on yes sir right
[12:42] see the devil wants to keep us so
[12:44] occupied looking at everything else we
[12:46] take our our eyes off the main thing
[12:49] that's right
[12:50] come on
[12:53] saints you got to watch your home
[12:57] come on
[12:58] you got to guard it with your life
[13:00] every day
[13:01] you can't be absent
[13:03] you can't be out fighting the enemy
[13:06] preach come on
[13:08] that's the truth
[13:10] all right y'all love him tonight
[13:13] fighting on the wrong side
[13:16] you know in this day we've got more
[13:18] cases
[13:19] of what they call autoimmune disorders
[13:26] that's a
[13:27] that's a recent thing
[13:29] they didn't used to have autoimmune
[13:31] disorders
[13:32] autoimmune disorder is when your body
[13:35] starts fighting its own self
[13:38] it's when your body turns on itself
[13:41] when a brother is if that's those cases
[13:43] in the natural
[13:45] then it's the case in the spiritual for
[13:47] our day as well
[13:49] that the body would turn on itself
[13:52] and start fighting itself
[13:55] y'all believe that yes
[13:57] that's a layover seeing spirit
[14:02] not in lao to see it sir
[14:06] we've moved past laodicea
[14:08] amen y'all believe that
[14:12] y'all believe that we're in a dual
[14:15] dispensation
[14:16] where the church is rolling on in
[14:18] laodicea but the bride
[14:21] is entering into a bright age y'all
[14:23] believe that here
[14:24] amen
[14:26] brother man you've got believers in this
[14:28] church
[14:30] amen
[14:32] i i don't want no pardon leo to see you
[14:35] i want to come out of laodicea
[14:38] amen i don't want to lay out the spirit
[14:40] on my uh distilled spirit or my home i
[14:42] don't want it in my church
[14:45] amen yes sir
[14:47] we've been called to a higher calling
[14:48] than laodicea
[14:52] and so we find then that these
[14:53] mercenaries
[14:55] that david had with him and they were
[14:57] all fighting the enemy and the enemy
[14:59] moved in and took over his
[15:01] took over his land took over his home
[15:03] took over his city took all that he had
[15:07] and the enemy will take everything you
[15:09] got
[15:10] if you let him
[15:11] let's move on down in and just look here
[15:13] this first three verses there we find
[15:16] this
[15:18] the fourth verse excuse me
[15:21] the bible said that david
[15:23] and the people that were with him
[15:26] they wept until they had no more power
[15:29] to weep
[15:33] because their home had been taken
[15:34] captive
[15:36] everything they knew was gone yeah
[15:39] has anybody ever been there
[15:41] yes sir come on
[15:44] if you don't know what this is talking
[15:46] about let something happen to one of
[15:48] your kids one time
[15:50] let one of your kids
[15:51] start getting out in the world
[15:56] let let something happen let some let us
[15:58] get a bad doctor's report on your wife
[16:01] or your husband yeah
[16:03] yeah
[16:04] all right come on
[16:06] let one of these big trials of life and
[16:08] you'll figure out what it means to weep
[16:11] until you got no more power to weep
[16:16] and you'll notice that the bible said
[16:17] that the men were all distressed and
[16:19] they'd whip until they had no more power
[16:21] to weep and and even they even took
[16:24] their time to turn on david
[16:28] their their ruler their leader their
[16:30] king
[16:31] and they turned on him
[16:33] and they spake a stone in him
[16:36] but don't get too
[16:38] judgmental on those people
[16:43] they were emotional
[16:45] they were hurting saints
[16:47] these people were hurting
[16:49] and you know what hurting people say
[16:52] stuff they don't mean
[16:54] certain people act ways that they don't
[16:57] mean to act
[16:58] they're emotional emotional people
[17:01] aren't rational
[17:05] we got to have enough grace to get
[17:07] through that
[17:09] we got to have enough grace that when
[17:11] when people come into the church we
[17:13] don't know what they went through right
[17:15] before they got in that door
[17:17] we don't know what they're going through
[17:19] at home we don't know what they're
[17:20] dealing with at work
[17:22] we don't know what kind of stress this
[17:23] is in their life
[17:25] all we see is what we see on the outside
[17:27] we don't know their day to day
[17:29] we don't know what any none of us know
[17:31] what any of us is going through
[17:34] but saints let me assure you every one
[17:36] of us is going through it every one of
[17:39] us is fighting a battle every one of us
[17:42] has got trials
[17:46] and every one of us needs prayer not
[17:48] condemnation
[17:50] every one of us needs a safe space to
[17:52] come into where we can worship him
[17:57] every one of us needs the opportunity to
[17:59] be able to come into his presence
[18:02] look sometimes people build up i talked
[18:04] about it last night brother joel people
[18:05] build up complexes based on opinions and
[18:08] not facts
[18:11] somebody can walk into church and
[18:13] they've had a bad day and maybe they
[18:15] don't have the right kind of expression
[18:17] on their face and we we see them and we
[18:19] say oh i bet he's mad at me about
[18:21] so-and-so
[18:26] and we start getting a complex about a
[18:28] brother or sister when it hasn't got
[18:30] anything to do with you
[18:33] and then we start recruiting people onto
[18:35] our side because it's important that
[18:37] we're right
[18:42] did you see the way he looked you see
[18:43] the way he acted you know i ain't done
[18:45] nothing to him
[18:48] and we influence the way people feel
[18:50] about other people
[18:53] but by stating our opinions as facts
[18:57] saints you don't know what anybody went
[18:59] through before they got here today
[19:03] you don't know what they're dealing with
[19:04] at their home
[19:06] we've got to have enough grace brothers
[19:08] and sisters
[19:12] i read a quote last night brother brown
[19:14] said if you find somebody doing
[19:15] something wrong don't say
[19:17] nothing about it
[19:22] just pray for him
[19:27] he didn't say go tell the whole church
[19:33] and they were upset
[19:35] and when people get upset they say
[19:37] things and they do things they don't
[19:39] mean to do
[19:40] and every one of us if we'll be honest
[19:42] with herself has been upset and has said
[19:45] something or done something we did not
[19:47] mean to do
[19:51] and we want grace for ourselves but we
[19:54] want vengeance for everybody else
[19:58] when we do wrong we want forgiveness
[20:00] when our brother does wrong we want
[20:02] vengeance
[20:04] amen but the bible said blessed are the
[20:08] merciful
[20:09] for they shall obtain mercy
[20:14] amen
[20:16] so don't be too hard on these brothers
[20:18] they they didn't mean it
[20:20] they were just upset
[20:22] and we can't be too hard on our brothers
[20:24] and sisters
[20:28] so we find in this
[20:31] they've been through some rough stuff
[20:34] you might have been through some rough
[20:36] stuff too but you'd have to admit
[20:39] this is probably a rougher day than any
[20:40] of us have seen
[20:43] everything was gone everything was taken
[20:49] that's true
[20:51] so you got hurting people
[20:53] hurting people
[20:55] yeah
[20:57] offending
[20:58] and being offended
[21:00] amen
[21:05] you know it doesn't matter
[21:08] if someone has something against you or
[21:10] not
[21:12] that's true
[21:15] you know they asked the lord peter did
[21:17] lord now if somebody
[21:20] offends me
[21:22] is it like seven times
[21:26] that i forgive them
[21:30] and on the eighth time that's pretty
[21:32] fair right seven times
[21:34] somebody does something bad to you seven
[21:36] times and then on the eighth time we can
[21:38] let them have it
[21:42] right jesus said now 70
[21:46] times seven
[21:49] how many is that
[21:53] it's y'all don't watch veggie tales it's
[21:55] 490 times y'all
[21:57] 490 times
[21:59] did nobody have veggietales
[22:02] my goodness
[22:05] 490 times
[22:08] but you have to forgive
[22:10] so no matter how annoying joel is to me
[22:19] i know you all love him like i do then
[22:22] no matter how annoying he is unless he's
[22:24] a knowing
[22:25] 491 times in the same day
[22:30] which being that he might be getting
[22:32] close i don't know
[22:34] you got to forgive him
[22:38] [Laughter]
[22:40] brother brahm says this in questions and
[22:41] answers he said now that's that's where
[22:44] trust that's he said that's a test of
[22:46] whether you got the holy spirit or not
[22:48] when somebody says something evil
[22:50] against someone someone that claims to
[22:53] have the holy spirit and you say i'll
[22:55] i'll get even with her even if it takes
[22:57] me my last day
[23:01] oh i've been there
[23:04] he said see now
[23:06] that's where you check about your holy
[23:08] spirit
[23:10] healing line brother branham said listen
[23:12] here's a lovely thing you and you serve
[23:15] one another you're serving god and see
[23:17] the love of god is in every christian
[23:20] heart and be kind to one another forgive
[23:23] one another and if you don't see the
[23:25] scripture just alike well you believe
[23:28] anyhow and pray for the other person and
[23:31] just love one another
[23:34] and you'll find that there's no greater
[23:36] evidence of a christian in the world
[23:40] than love
[23:43] now you didn't say if you don't see the
[23:44] scripture just alike
[23:49] snip and quote a clip and copy and paste
[23:52] all the quotes that you can find to cut
[23:54] the brother down
[24:01] see it's we need to learn the message we
[24:03] need to know the message those tapes
[24:05] need to keep playing
[24:07] but brothers and sisters it's to make us
[24:09] better not to prove somebody else wrong
[24:13] it's to help us
[24:18] i don't want a bunch of parents that
[24:19] just can repeat every quote i want
[24:21] somebody that's living those quotes on
[24:23] the inside
[24:25] i want somebody measuring themselves by
[24:27] the word of god
[24:30] and saying lord here i am here's where
[24:32] your word says i should be now take me
[24:34] to where i should be lord.
[24:39] amen
[24:40] we're not learning the message to prove
[24:41] how we're right
[24:44] guess what we wouldn't rights
[24:48] none of us was right
[24:50] and if you're right today it's by the
[24:52] grace of god it's not anything we did
[24:57] and if we're right we can just say thank
[24:59] you lord
[25:01] and if you made me right lord think
[25:04] about this saints
[25:06] if he made you right
[25:08] he can do the same thing for your
[25:10] brother
[25:11] he can do the same thing for your sister
[25:14] amen
[25:16] is this all right tonight
[25:18] and so we find him brother branham says
[25:20] be kind to one another be kind to your
[25:24] enemies
[25:29] that's asking a lot
[25:31] be kind to one another be kind to your
[25:33] enemies love everybody no matter what
[25:36] they've done love them anyhow
[25:39] and if you can't do that brother sister
[25:44] if there ever was a time
[25:47] then you need to be
[25:48] at the altar
[25:56] inspiration he says and if there's
[25:57] anything we ought to be it's kind to one
[25:59] another when you see a brother a sister
[26:01] in fault don't never breathe it to
[26:04] nobody
[26:05] keep it to yourself and pray
[26:09] for that person
[26:11] be kind to them
[26:14] and if the spirit of god is in you then
[26:17] you will be kind to one another
[26:21] brother brahma said god don't let me be
[26:24] crowned a crab it old man
[26:27] don't let my wife be a crab an old woman
[26:31] let me grow
[26:32] gracefully in age amen let me let me get
[26:36] sweeter as the days go on
[26:39] [Music]
[26:41] let me no matter what the scars are if
[26:44] you've been in the message very long at
[26:46] all you got some scars yeah that's right
[26:49] you've got some complexes
[26:52] you've been through some trials you've
[26:54] been in a message very long
[26:59] those grudges don't hold nobody back but
[27:01] you
[27:02] and if you got a grudge against a
[27:03] brother or
[27:04] sister they don't even know about it
[27:06] it's not bothering them
[27:09] it's only bothering you it's only
[27:12] holding you back
[27:16] not them
[27:22] so we find then moving forward just a
[27:25] little bit back to our back to our text
[27:29] we're finding everything was going wrong
[27:31] with david
[27:32] yeah his men were turned against him
[27:38] his wife his children all of his goods
[27:42] they were gone
[27:44] the enemy had taken everything you know
[27:45] sometimes life takes more than it gives
[27:50] that's true
[27:52] and david
[27:55] was we'll call it at the end of his rope
[27:59] and the bible said
[28:01] that at the end of his robe
[28:03] david
[28:06] david's pastor came and preached him
[28:10] a powerful message
[28:15] all david's friends came and had a
[28:16] prayer meeting for him
[28:23] david had to encourage
[28:25] himself
[28:27] in the
[28:28] that's right lord the bride has made
[28:33] herself
[28:35] ready yes sir
[28:38] amen it's an individual affair
[28:42] between us and god
[28:46] i love my children
[28:47] i've raised my children in the message
[28:49] the best of my ability
[28:51] but they got to come the same way i did
[28:53] that's right
[28:55] they got to have their own experience
[28:58] it's not good enough me telling them
[28:59] about my experiences
[29:04] they got to come their own way
[29:06] yes sir
[29:09] amen yeah
[29:11] you got to have your own experience and
[29:13] david the bible said encouraged
[29:16] himself in the lord
[29:20] what a lesson to
[29:24] us sometimes you're going to find out
[29:27] brothers and sisters when you start
[29:29] stepping for the lord brother joel
[29:32] when you start working for the lord when
[29:34] you start doing what the lord has called
[29:37] you to do
[29:38] when you when you start when you take
[29:40] out when you feel the leadership of the
[29:41] holy spirit in your life
[29:43] and and you and you step out on faith to
[29:46] pursue that what the lord has led you to
[29:49] do you're going to turn around and look
[29:50] and you're going to find you're all by
[29:52] yourself
[29:57] your family
[29:59] they'll turn on you sometime
[30:03] even your even your husband your wife
[30:05] sometimes won't see what you see
[30:11] sometimes this walk is a is a lonely one
[30:17] it's just you
[30:19] and jesus
[30:23] the bible said david
[30:25] encouraged himself
[30:27] in the lord
[30:32] but i want you to notice it says that
[30:34] but it goes on to say specifically how
[30:37] it was
[30:38] that david went about doing that
[30:43] let's look at that just just for a
[30:45] moment now
[30:46] david
[30:48] encouraged himself in the lord seventh
[30:51] verse says this
[30:53] that david said to avatar the priest
[30:56] amalek's son
[30:58] i pray thee
[31:00] bring me hither the ephod
[31:06] now y'all know what the ephod is right
[31:08] it's the it's the it's the breastplate
[31:10] of air
[31:11] it's the urim of thumb
[31:13] oh yeah
[31:16] amen
[31:17] now we know what our
[31:19] you're my feminist
[31:23] brother braham said it was the word
[31:26] amen
[31:28] he said ours today it's the word of god
[31:32] amen
[31:33] so david said i'll tell you what i'm
[31:34] going to need here
[31:37] i'm going to need to hear some word yeah
[31:41] i'm going to need to see
[31:43] what the word says do about my situation
[31:47] here
[31:50] i'm going to need to hear it for myself
[31:54] i'm going to need to hear the word of
[31:56] god
[32:02] so they brought it to him and he got to
[32:03] looking
[32:05] and after he went before
[32:07] the ephod
[32:13] the bible said in the eighth verse that
[32:15] david
[32:17] inquired of the lord
[32:20] saying shall i pursue after this troop
[32:25] david went to prayer
[32:28] all right
[32:29] is that right yeah
[32:33] so it's a simple
[32:34] two-step process
[32:38] for you and i
[32:41] to use to encourage
[32:43] ourselves in the lord
[32:46] brother braham said a christian
[32:49] reads their bible
[32:51] and prays
[32:53] every day yes sir
[32:55] amen
[32:57] read your bible and pray
[33:01] hear the word and pray
[33:06] you see
[33:07] when you come to the house of the lord
[33:09] if brother ben stands up here and gives
[33:12] the message that the lord placed on his
[33:13] heart that is the word of god to you
[33:18] but then then the other part of that is
[33:20] you got to receive it
[33:22] and then after you receive it how many
[33:25] of you can be honest with yourself and
[33:26] say i don't pray enough
[33:28] about it
[33:30] amen
[33:31] i don't pray enough about it you know
[33:32] when we leave the church we should go
[33:34] home and be prayerful about the service
[33:37] that we just heard yes sir and praying
[33:40] for the service that is to come
[33:42] and we're constantly praying that god
[33:44] will deliver the word to us that we need
[33:47] to stay encouraged
[33:50] in our walk
[33:52] it doesn't happen just but it's not just
[33:55] all on the pastor
[33:58] it takes all of us pulling it takes all
[34:00] of us praying
[34:03] you dictate the quality of the service
[34:06] you dictate the operation of the gift
[34:11] and we don't spend near the time needed
[34:14] to invest in prayer into our services
[34:17] saints
[34:21] you get the congregation praying you
[34:23] want to set the house on fire
[34:26] get the congregation to pray
[34:30] amen that and and when do you do the
[34:33] clarity by which
[34:35] brother ben can bring the message
[34:38] it's exponentially increased
[34:41] amen
[34:42] it opens the
[34:47] yes sir channel sir
[34:48] when we listen to the message
[34:51] we listen to the tapes
[34:53] saints it's not background noise
[34:56] i believe it's disrespectful for it to
[34:58] be background noise
[35:01] when we listen to those tapes we need to
[35:03] listen to those tapes
[35:06] minimize the disruption
[35:09] and focus on what he's saying
[35:16] y'all believe that yes
[35:19] and so we find then that david did those
[35:21] things david looked at the ephod david
[35:24] consulted the lord david sought the lord
[35:26] and when david got the decision from the
[35:29] lord the lord said go get it back
[35:31] yes sir
[35:32] go take back what belongs to you
[35:37] now saints here's the here's the trick
[35:39] though it's good it's good to get the
[35:41] word from the lord
[35:43] it's really good to get the word from
[35:44] the lord it's good to have an answer
[35:46] from god
[35:47] it's good
[35:48] but then david had to do something
[35:52] he couldn't just say well thank you lord
[35:55] amen thank you lord for giving me the
[35:58] answer to my prayer no the bible said he
[36:00] had to go pursue
[36:03] the enemy
[36:05] yes sir
[36:07] he had to go he had to get after it
[36:09] saints
[36:10] you can't just ask the lord to answer
[36:12] your prayer and then when it does you
[36:15] just sit there on your laurels
[36:18] when we pray we ask god to do something
[36:20] we got to be looking for the answer
[36:25] yes sir and when he shows you what to do
[36:27] then then you got to do it
[36:30] look david was having a bad day it's
[36:31] okay to have a bad day
[36:34] it's all right
[36:36] everybody's got a bad day it's okay to
[36:38] feel sorry for yourself sometimes it's
[36:40] fine
[36:42] it's all right to spend the day moping
[36:44] around
[36:45] feeling sorry thinking you got it worse
[36:48] than anybody else look elijah did it
[36:50] elijah said i'm the only one lord
[36:53] i'm the only one it's just me lord i'm
[36:56] the only one that hadn't bowed the knee
[36:58] to bear there were seven thousand others
[37:00] that was just like him
[37:02] and when you think you're the only one
[37:05] no there's seven thousand other people
[37:07] going through the exact same thing
[37:08] you're going through
[37:10] and it's all right to have a bad day
[37:12] it's all right to get down but after a
[37:14] while you got to shake yourself
[37:17] you got to say i've had enough of it
[37:21] i'm done with it
[37:22] i'm tired of being tired
[37:26] i've had enough
[37:28] it's time for me to take back what god
[37:31] has given
[37:34] thank you me and david said i've had
[37:37] enough of all this crime yeah i've had
[37:39] enough of all this complaining
[37:42] i've had enough of all this bickering
[37:47] i'm not looking at all of y'all no more
[37:49] i'm looking right square at the enemy
[37:51] and i'm going to take back what it stole
[37:54] from me
[37:57] and he got his sights centered right on
[38:00] the enemy
[38:01] and brothers and sisters when you get
[38:02] your sights centered on the devil yes
[38:05] yes sir that's when you can go to work
[38:12] invasion of the usa brother brown said
[38:14] god may this little audience on this day
[38:17] wake up quickly
[38:20] right now before the end time comes and
[38:22] catches us in this condition may we
[38:25] renew ourselves
[38:27] as the how many of you want to renew
[38:29] yourselves this afternoon i want to be
[38:31] renewed today
[38:35] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[38:39] lord i've been through some trials i've
[38:40] been through some tests but i'm asking
[38:42] you to restore me
[38:47] and he said rise
[38:50] and shake yourself
[38:54] and ask for the old way which is the
[38:56] good way and when you find it
[38:59] walk in it he said yes
[39:02] god grant that we can find the row old
[39:06] rugged way when we can stand together as
[39:09] hundreds and join our hands together and
[39:12] sing i'll take the way with the lord's
[39:15] despised few i've started in with jesus
[39:19] and i'm going through
[39:21] god help us to live and be like that
[39:26] amen
[39:28] thank you lord
[39:33] amen
[39:38] brother brown said god keeps his word he
[39:40] said stay out of this modern world
[39:43] stay out of these modern theologies yes
[39:47] just look to the lamb of god
[39:50] read your bible and pray all the time
[39:54] don't be weary be rejoicing
[39:58] happy for the redemption of the church
[40:00] is drawing nigh
[40:02] when we shall see him who died for us
[40:10] in tyson's spirits he said come give all
[40:13] you got to god
[40:15] say god i ain't got very much i'm just a
[40:18] little housewife i can't do very much
[40:20] lord but i can read my bible and i can
[40:23] pray every day i can throw out all the
[40:26] trash that's in my mind i can throw out
[40:29] all the stuff
[40:31] say sometimes we got to have a house
[40:34] cleaning
[40:37] sometimes we got to go through the house
[40:40] with the trash can
[40:44] get a hold of some of them games and and
[40:46] movies and stuff
[40:51] put it right in the trash
[40:54] it ain't good enough to do it once you
[40:56] got to keep going back and doing it over
[40:58] and over and over again
[41:02] you got to constantly be on patrol
[41:11] david got the word of the lord
[41:13] and it put david in action right yes sir
[41:17] see too many times we got the clear-cut
[41:19] word of god but we won't put it in
[41:21] action
[41:23] saint you don't have to ask the lord if
[41:25] it's his will for you to be healed
[41:28] it is his will for you to be healed
[41:34] don't believe that
[41:36] you don't have to ask god if it's his
[41:38] will to save your family it is in his
[41:41] word saints you apply that token to
[41:45] their life
[41:47] now leave the results up to him you do
[41:49] what he said
[41:52] i don't know what they're living like
[41:54] now oh maybe they're not living right it
[41:56] doesn't matter you apply that token
[41:58] anyhow
[42:01] yes sir
[42:02] get into action space
[42:12] brother braham says god's provide a way
[42:14] now when you say you've got faith for
[42:16] divine healing and something strikes you
[42:18] and says move out that's the
[42:20] confirmation that god has received your
[42:23] faith
[42:24] for divine healing that's right and when
[42:26] you got courage to put your faith in
[42:28] action but when you say you got faith
[42:31] and are afraid to let it go your faith
[42:34] is dead
[42:39] see but when you got faith and willing
[42:41] to let it go
[42:44] then god is confirming it with signs and
[42:47] wonders following and you'll see your
[42:49] healing yes sir
[42:51] [Music]
[42:53] the uncertain sound brother brown says
[42:55] if one church says do this and the other
[42:57] church says do that and one church says
[42:58] do this and another one says do that how
[43:01] can the christian know what to do
[43:03] sure
[43:05] see that's why we got one shout brothers
[43:07] and sisters we got one shout out
[43:14] these are believers brother ben i'm
[43:16] these are believers in here y'all
[43:17] believe we got one shout for our day
[43:20] amen
[43:21] the shout
[43:23] out
[43:24] the message that went forth that gathers
[43:26] the bride
[43:27] y'all believe that
[43:28] amen
[43:30] and so we find that the church says this
[43:32] church says that he says one says one
[43:35] thing one says another but i tell you my
[43:38] dear brother i'll tell you a place where
[43:40] there's no uncertain sound that's the
[43:42] bible
[43:45] that's god's eternal word it's the
[43:48] gospel and the gospel is the power and
[43:51] demonstration of the holy spirit put in
[43:54] action he said brothers and sisters this
[43:56] gospel that we preach it isn't just
[43:59] flowery words it is the power of the
[44:02] holy spirit that's put into action
[44:06] and we put the holy spirit in action in
[44:09] our life
[44:12] all you do you come to church you hear
[44:14] the word but then you gotta believe it
[44:16] receive it accept it and act upon it
[44:22] amen if you if you want to be healed you
[44:24] got to act healed
[44:31] [Music]
[44:34] amen if you want your family saved
[44:36] testify that god's saving them
[44:40] don't talk negative about them
[44:42] oh they're just getting worse and worse
[44:45] and worse no they're getting better
[44:48] god's word said they're getting better
[44:57] amen
[45:00] call those things that are not as though
[45:03] their words put your faith into action
[45:16] i like this now david
[45:19] put his faith into action
[45:21] yes he did
[45:22] 16th verse if y'all can pull that up i
[45:24] love this
[45:31] the bible said david
[45:34] he chased down those amalekites and when
[45:36] he found him
[45:38] yeah yeah
[45:41] oh they were having a good time oh yeah
[45:47] you know the enemy he's rejoicing
[45:49] at your infirmities
[45:51] oh they were having a good time they
[45:53] they were singing and dancing
[45:56] they were having a big time
[45:58] they was they was they was all happy
[46:00] because i took all of david's sheep and
[46:03] all of his cattle and all of his goods
[46:05] and they took all of his well he took
[46:07] his wives they took his children
[46:11] you know when the enemy thinks he's got
[46:12] the upper hand he gets he gets boastful
[46:16] he gets aggressive
[46:18] when he thinks he got the upper hand
[46:21] amen he gets bold
[46:23] when he thinks he's got the upper hand
[46:32] preach but the 17th verse says that
[46:38] david looked down on all that
[46:40] looked down at the enemy having a good
[46:43] time at his expense
[46:45] and david knew what the lord told him to
[46:47] do
[46:49] and the bible said
[46:52] that david
[46:54] smote that bunch of philistines
[46:56] or amalekites rather excuse me
[46:59] smote that bunch of amalekites
[47:02] from the twilight of one day
[47:05] to the evening of the next day
[47:10] brothers and sisters
[47:12] when you get your hands on the devil
[47:16] don't you let him up until he's dead
[47:20] don't you get up until it's all when you
[47:22] get down here in prayer
[47:24] don't you get up until it's finished
[47:29] when you're searching and you find the
[47:31] answer that you're looking for don't you
[47:33] stop until you get what you came for
[47:38] david didn't david didn't david didn't
[47:40] start fighting and get about half his
[47:42] stuff back
[47:45] david david smote amalekites
[47:48] from the night
[47:50] evening of one day until the evening of
[47:52] the next day he was constantly smiting
[47:56] the malachites
[48:01] they said david aren't you hungry i

[48:23] i'm not taking my eyes off of this
[48:26] david didn't stop
[48:28] until
[48:29] it was done
[48:32] and the bible said
[48:35] that david
[48:37] recovered
[48:39] all
[48:42] for every bit of it

[49:17] from that trouble
[49:19] he's not going to almost meet your needs
[49:22] he's not going to come pretty close
[49:25] to helping you pay the light bill
[49:32] he does it all
[49:34] yes sir yes sir
[49:36] yes he does
[49:40] not only does he do it all

[49:50] with five loaves and two fish
[49:54] and after he got done they had to take

[50:08] extra more exceedingly abundantly above
[50:12] what we could ask for
[50:15] more than what we asked for
[50:17] greater than what we thought we needed
[50:23] the bible said he took the increase yes
[50:31] 19th verse there was nothing lacking to
[50:33] them neither small nor great neither
[50:36] sons nor daughters neither spoiled nor
[50:38] anything that they had taken him david
