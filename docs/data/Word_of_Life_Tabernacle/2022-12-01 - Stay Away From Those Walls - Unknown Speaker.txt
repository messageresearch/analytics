Lord we are who who you say that we are and what your word says that we are we thank you for that Lord I pray that you bless the people today bless those that are sick and in need Lord those that are watching not pray a special blessing to them tonight and especially those who came let me ask it in Jesus name amen and God bless you turn with me to Joshua chapter 6. Joshua 6 26 and then First Kings 16 34. well you're turning there well brother Timothy you'll be here both services on Sunday so try to be here and bring a friend if you've got one that if you've got a friend that wants to come to church and you're welcome to bring them I'm sure it'll be a blessing we'll have church on Sunday we're going to have church tonight and it's good to have all of our sick folks back with us or most of them anyway it's good to have all of you all with us tonight and then the kids Christmas play at six o'clock on Sunday be a full day on Sunday but it's just the only time we could do it but we're just glad that we were able to do it and that the kids are here we're so glad to have uh young people in the church and children in the church and we want to help them all that we can and let them be a blessing to us as well Joshua 6 26 I want to kind of continue uh from where we were on Sunday and just kind of maybe a little bit different subject but the same scriptures that we use on Sunday and Joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man before the Lord that rises up and buildeth this city Jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it so in other words he'll lose his firstborn and name the foundation after him and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it he'll lose his youngest son and name the gates of it after him and then First Kings 16 and 34 we see the exact fulfillment of the word do you believe God keeps his word he said in his days that Heil the bethelite bill Jericho he laid the foundation thereof in a Byram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Sega according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Joshua the son of none I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word he may be seated this this evening whenever you're coming out of something and going into something as walls are destroyed as they fall down we need to be careful and be sure that we don't try to rebuild the walls of the cities that we go through and I think that's true of us personally as well when you go through something in life there's a reason why God allowed certain things in your life to to pass away or to I will say it maybe to be destroyed in your life there's things you look at it and say I wish I could live through that time again I wish things hadn't happened like they did but it was it's gone for a reason there's a reason why you don't do the things that you used to do don't don't look at that time and think well I was happier back then or we were better off back then we don't need to live in the past do we we need to live in the present though right now but the Brandon said man is always ignoring what God is doing right now he's always looking to what God's going to do looking back to what God did but we need to look at what God's doing right now and so uh in looking at this as Joshua come into the land we find there was a parallel to that of the early church that there was a great controversy over the Gentiles and whether or not the Gentiles could come in and whether or not they could be a full-blown Believers without having the Jewish law without being circumcised and eating the right kind of meat and stuff like that and finally they agreed and they saw but because it was manifested before them that God gave them the Holy Ghost and that was the argument that Paul uses he said God give them the holy goes just like he did you and so in doing that then they begin to realize by the bill that they were also they were also Christians and so they said okay there's certain things that they don't need to do but uh but we'll we'll allow them to be who they are and so the gospel of grace began to be preached through the Apostle Paul but now there was this great controversy and there was some who again they can't ever come into the present they've always got to live in the past and try to build back those walls and so what they were doing is they were building back excuse me this this evening but they were building back those walls of the law and so we find that that even those ones who were pushing that they come down to Jerusalem or they come down to Antioch rather where Peter was and Peter uh saw them come from Jerusalem and and Paul says it this way he said when Peter was come to Antioch I would stood him to the faith because he was to be blamed right what was Peter doing he was going with those who were rebuilding those Jewish walls yeah and it's not time to rebuild the walls it's time to move on into the land how many believe that tonight so Peter was coming and he was he withstood him to the face he said because certain before certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision assembled likewise with him that word dissembled you need to remember that because anytime someone dissembles from the church or separates themselves from the from the Believers from the group of Believers you better make sure you have a valid reason to do that and that you're not just splitting hairs over some kind of little petty thing which is what they were doing and and so he said it's so much that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation he said but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before them all if thou being a Jew livest after the manner of Gentiles and not as to the Jews why compel us thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews we who are Jews by nature and not Sinners of the Gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law aren't you glad of that today but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for by The Works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found Sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid he said for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor listen to me Church don't go back to yesterday don't go back to Jericho could you imagine Rahab as she was coming out of Jericho she's coming out of that City and the walls fell down around her she had no desire to go back because the only thing there was accusations the only thing there was her old life the only thing there was the men who could remember but they'd all been destroyed she had no desire to go back but what did she do she went with the with her husband oh but she went into the land and she actually built helped build a city Bethlehem yeah she went in and began digging ditches in Bethlehem and and helping set up a house and and made a permanent home there because that's where God wanted her to be listen God wants you to be where you're at tonight he if he wanted you to be where you were he'd have left you there come on come on are you with me now so we need to we need to go on into the land go on into the promise well I remember how things were back in the Pentecostal Church go on in are you with me now I remember how things were 50 years ago in the message it may have been wonderful but you need to go on in those things were destroyed for a reason and if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor so the principle is what God has destroyed was destroyed for a reason I know change is hard if you've ever moved you know change is hard if you've ever gotten married you know change is hard if you've ever had kids you know change is hard especially if you have three or four of them change is hard and and you know but it's absolutely necessary to survival right if people say well I'm not going to change you just wouldn't survive civilization would fall apart because we must have changed to have survival and brother Branham reads the story um in the newspaper about animals and birds he tells it many times in the message but he said that in India they had walls around the fields instead of fences like we do here and he tells this story about how that the animals and the birds at a certain day they begin to move into the middle of the field they left their their little nooks and crannies in the wall or where they were standing in the shade of the wall and they moved into the middle of the field and congregated together and he said the reason was because there was an earthquake coming but nobody forecasted it they couldn't read the paper and see that it was coming the human beings didn't know that it was coming but the animals had a sense about that there was a god-given sense about them but Brandon said it was the same thing that took them into the ark and so they begin to move into the middle away from those walls and brother Brown said this he said now let me say something brother he said there is something fixing to happen and all these big old ecclesiastical walls are going to collapse and go right back over Yonder and agree now notice the walls are going to fall down and again that's what when we come into the land the opening of the word the walls fall down but now what they're going to do is come back and agree together because they're going to do it as certain as I'm standing here remember what happened when Joshua come in the land all them Kings never could get along till Joshua came and when Joshua came into the land all the kings began to come against him they began to work together against Joshua and that's exactly what happened when we see the opening of the word we see and then immediately you begin to see an ecumenical move that begins to come together and let me tell you this today they're all the same right whether it's the Harlot in Revelation 17 or her daughters they're all the same and there's good people in there I may know that tonight but stay away from them walls right because they're all going back over Yonder and agree he said because they're going to do it as certain as I'm standing here he said there is an image to that Beast just as certain as I'm standing here and this nation took it according to the word of the Lord said listen oh I love this he said when you feel that little funny feeling you get away from them walls I don't know about you but I I grew up around denominational people and going to churches and and and I I we have a lot of experience going from church to church and my dad was always trying to reach somebody but they begin to preach on the Trinity and you get a little funny feeling they begin to talk about joining church and and putting your name on a book and and what it takes to be saved in any that without certain denomination you eat a little funny feeling while you you've been brought out into something else you've been brought out into something new something fresh a reality of the Gospel we don't want to go back we are not of those who go back into those things so he said when you get that little funny feeling you get away from them walls yeah get away he said you'll die in there don't do it and we know he's talking about denominationalism but we can apply that to anything God has destroyed right any walls that have come down he said for the will come down he said get away from all this stuff flee to safety as quick as you can ask God for mercy I love the way he takes this he said don't just take somewhere my mother mother was Methodist so I suppose I'll be my papa was Baptist I'll be don't you do that don't you take any chance yeah and I'll say to you A Word of Life Tabernacle if this would be the last sermon that I would ever preach to you don't take any chances stay away from them walls we have a message for a reason I don't say well my papa was Baptist so I go to Word of Life Tabernacle it's not enough he said don't take any chance he said I don't care how simple and humble it seems It's the word of the Lord you flee to Jesus Christ just as quick as you can and stay there until God fills you with this Holy Spirit for the hour is going to come when you're going to hunt for it and it won't be there she'll be sure to do it he said now look so those walls are going to fall you need to get away from them why would we go back to a dead system that's been defeated and proven to be dead I've noticed that in the message it seems to only be attractive to those who are not enslaved by it right that they they grew up in the message and they so they have this view of denominationalism that is some kind of freedom and it's actually a bondage and and you'll find it's a bondage because you watch even today even more than in brother random's time there's really no difference in the churches they're all the same you can go in a Baptist Church we were in a Baptist Church the other night at a at a Gaither concert you'd go in that Baptist Church or a charismatic church there's no difference in their worship right no difference in the preaching it's all modernized everything's the same right you're going to go and you're going to hear there may be little doctrinal things and things that but but for the most part they're all the same and they teach the same thing and and they preach the same thing and they hatch their preacher out of the cemetery right to come and preach to them why would we go back to that why would we take why would we take that when we have when we have a full open book a fullness of the word why do we take a partial word when we have a full word why would we take it why would we take a dead system when we have a living Christ right but it's only attracted to people that and I think sometimes as message I'm a have several generations of message believer but I've seen those things and I think sometimes we we just we look at it we begin to think well you know it's not too bad I I think we'd probably be better off out there no you wouldn't be if you're a real believer there's something in your heart that cries out for Freedom it cries out to be in the in the Church of the firstborn see Paul tells us so we're not we've not come to the law how many believe that tonight we've not come to a mouth that can't be touched or we've read it recently but I'll read it here again he said you were coming to Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant to the blood of sprinkling to speak of better things than that of Abel why go back to those walls when you've come to this so he's telling them he said don't go back to Mount Sinai there's nothing there but death don't rebuild those walls whether whether you're Peter or anybody else don't go back and build those walls stay away from it we don't want to go back to that old mountain now I just I'm laying the background here and then we'll get to what I want to say now we don't want to go back to that old mountain but random said this he said have you noticed every three years after a great meeting what takes place a denomination he said this is 20 years and no denomination dear dying lamb man never do that if I go in this generation May the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination he said you'll die right in your track remember that the very hour that you mentioned denomination among you I don't care how sincere you are listen I don't care how sincere you are you take Man For Your Leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word that's the hour you die and it doesn't matter who the man is the hour you take me for your leader instead of the Holy Ghost that's the hour you die the hour you take brother Joel for your leader instead of the Holy Ghost that's the hour you die or any of these other brothers that's the very hour you die it's hour you take any man right are you with me now the genuine seed cannot oh I love that oh that gives me Comfort but the Stuart I know that I'm that's who I am genuine seed cannot now again not that they not only will not cannot because there's nothing left after the seed it's the same thing was back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again oh my so there's a group of people who can't fall are you with me now there's nothing in them to want to go back and rebuild those walls and yet in our flesh we we must guard against this because and this is where Peter we know Peter was a Godly Man and he was a man who had the Holy Ghost we know he had the Holy Ghost right he's the one who got up and preached the sermon and yet Paul had to withstand him to the to his face because he was trying to rebuild something that happened 40 years ago the way they worshiped when he was a kid huh and he said don't do that we've come into something else and so there's some things and I've talked about some of these things before but just bear with me tonight because there's some things we have to do to maintain our freedom and we have how many how many are glad for freedom you don't have any District presbyter telling the pastor what to preach you don't have any you don't have any uh any uh people out here that are a deacon board that's telling the pastor what to preach a pastor gets to hear from God and preach it directly to you and then not only that but you're not under bondage you don't have somebody sitting there constantly putting their thumb on you and telling you who you should marry and what you I hope you're not right and what you should do I give you advice but you're not under bondage you're only bound to the word right that's what you're bound to and if you find yourself back inside those walls again you need to get out of that so now we've got to maintain our freedom how do we do that well first as I begin to think about these things I I thought we must resist the temptation to protect what we have by human effort God gave it to us but we've got to resist the temptation to protect it by human effort and hael the one who built the wall of Jericho he probably thought that he was doing a great thing protecting the citizens of Jericho from foreign Invaders he probably assumed that he was doing the will of the Lord because he was an Israelite and the Israelites had taken Jericho he said all these years Jericho hadn't had walls we need to rebuild the walls but he paid the price with his children and brother Branham when he was speaking to the Pentecostals because they were looking back at what had happened in 1906 and he's speaking to the Full Gospel businessman he tells him he preaches a message called turning northward and I've quoted from it extensively recently but he said just Divine Healing and speaking in tongues he said well that's just a few grapes that was brought back from across the land he said the land is ours It All Belongs To Us someone say it all belongs to us all of it belongs to us amen don't now watch where he takes this now he said don't be afraid that the other fellow is going to beat you over there and that's a lot of times why we start trying to protect what we have because we're afraid the other fellow is going to beat us over there he said just join up with him and go on over yeah yeah you know if you reject light just because another church brought it you become a denominational wall yeah you've walled yourself in if it's truth it's truth if it's not truth it's not truth if it's truth it's truth if the Catholic priest preaches it if it's not truth it's not true even if even if I preach it are you with me now if it's not if it's not truth it doesn't matter who who preaches it if it's wrong it's wrong that's right no matter how many years of experience they have or how much I love them if it's not true it's just not true are you with me now and he said he said don't be afraid the other fellow is going to beat you over there just join up with him and going over that's the way to do it and we've been on this mountain for 40 years let's get off of it and go towards the Promised Land and again now probably being a little introspective but it's a great temptation to pastors especially as you get some years on you because we built it we feel like with our Blood Sweat and Tears yeah right because it takes something out of you and I'm not trying to complain but every year that you Pastor take something out of you and you give yourself to the people it ought to be that way right we're serving you every year that you preach if you minister to the people who take something out of you right you're giving your life for the people so many times then we kind of feel like we have ownership of it yeah and if we don't watch it we'll get to where we don't want anybody to tear it down so but we don't realize we're not the Builder God is we plant the seed yeah we scatter the light but God has to protect it it doesn't do the seed one bit of good for us to plant it and then go back and dig it up every day in fact if we do that it'll never grow but we say well I built it with my my blood literally I built it with my sweat I built it by working in Pirates tirelessly working for the people and but but that's we're just stewards of God and listen he told the disciples he said when you've done all that you've been asked to do come on he said remember you're just unprofitable servants you did what you were asked to do what you were called to do so we are not the ultimate Builders First Corinthians 3 and 6 that I've planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase and remember this in your own lives as well because many times we want to protect our families like that we want to build up walls we're not going I'm not going to lie I'm not going to make the mistakes my father did and that's a good thing we want to break that cycle right but don't build up walls where you can't move on in the word because if we're not careful while my dad discipline me in a certain way I'm not going to discipline my kids at all you better be careful right my father did this this way and so I'm going to take the opposite side no you need to take what the word says right he said I've planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase so that neither is he that planteth anything neither he that wadereth but God that giveth the increase he said now he that planet that he that watereth her one are you with me now most of you have been in the message or were in the message before I come around I'm watering are you with me now some of you all a few I planted right but most I'm watering but whether I'm watering or planning we're one right I'm working for the same purpose as the one that planted the seed are you with me now maybe you got saved at Youth Camp maybe you got saved if maybe you got uh filled with the Holy Ghost in another church but that don't mean anything to me I'm just watering what somebody else planted it's not my plant it's not my it's not my acreage are you with me now our families are the same we're stewards of something that God gave us aren't you glad to be a steward don't you want to be a good Steward today I want to be a good Steward of what God gave me I want to love them I want to protect them but Lord help me not to wall it off and make it my own become a lord over God's heritage look because it belongs to God and job said it this way he said the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord yes he allowed you to have him in the first place he he can take care of them yeah watch he said we are laborers together with God he said he said you were laborers we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry that means you're God's field the farm belongs to God and then he changes his metaphors he said you are God's Building you are God's husband or he's using the metaphor of a field and plants now he says you're God's Building he says according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder he said I have laid the foundation and another bill that thereon but let every man take heed how he builds a therapon other Foundation can no man lay then that enslaved which is Jesus Christ he said now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones would hey stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is I don't get to try every man's work I get to build yeah are you with me now and I got to be careful what I build with but it's not up to me to try every man's work are you with me now we don't get to try every other family's work we don't get to try every other Church's work right it's up to us to build let's make sure we're building with gold silver precious stones Others May build with wood hay and stubble but let's make sure what we're doing are you with me because every man's work will be made manifest one day yes the day shall declare it right if it don't last in the fire it'll be revealed by fire so I would say this don't waste your time trying to protect your legacy your family name your ministry right God planted it God's able to take care of it the Bible tells us promotion cometh neither from the East nor from the West nor from the south nor from the pastor nor from another pastor are you with me now nor from the people promotion doesn't come from that ah you you all voted me in as a pastor but you didn't call me to preach right you didn't make me a preacher we ordained brother Joel the other day but we didn't make him a preacher right are you with me now promotion don't come from the East to the west or the South but God is the judge he put us down one and set us up another so be careful be careful and to resist the temptation to protect what we have by human effort now let's let's move on I would say the second thing is say we have to say no or learn to say no to leaders and that's a dangerous thing for for a person in a leadership position to say by the way I get nervous even thinking about it because there are some people who only say no that class of person exists well you know in a church there's always going to be somebody votes no on everything and that's the truth don't worry I'm not talking about you unless you're that person right but there's always going to be that person just vote Stone no matter what you do and you just know they're just a it's just their they have a contrarian kind of attitude but I I don't think we should be troublemakers but if it's wrong it's wrong so we need to learn to say no to leaders who place themselves above the word it doesn't mean we should be troublemakers make sure it's the word we're standing for and not not some red herring not some not not some little thing that they run off on a tangent somewhere make sure it's the word but if it's the word stay with it above every leader are you with me now you know Heil probably thought that he was following the great king ahab's instructions so he would be okay Ahab was sitting there he was the king of Israel he was anointed king of Israel and so he said I'm following ahab's instructions I'll be okay but he should have said no he'd have saved his children that's why you know Paul withstood Peter to the face these things are serious even among Christians we we don't want to go back we want to go forward we want to move on to the opening of the word John wrote to the Ephesian church and and and he said this and to the Ephesian Church age he said I know that works and I labor my patience and how how can it's not better than what you're evil now has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not has found them Liars it's pretty strong language isn't it he said he found them to be Liars and brother Brandon says this he said how'd they know that how did they know they were Liars they wasn't quoting with the word now he doesn't say they wasn't quoting the word but they wasn't quoting with the word right so what they were saying didn't match the word you couldn't find it in the scripture you couldn't find it and what Paul said so he said that early church he said you've tried them who would call themselves Apostles in other words the Apostle is the one who lays the foundation these ones who say they're laying a foundation but it's not a foundation of the word he said you found them to be Liars and he said how did you know that they wasn't quoting with the word he said now if a man says that this Bible says that in Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday yesterday today and forever he said the man said oh the days of Miracles has passed then that man's a liar again that's pretty strong language isn't it but it's the truth sometimes we got to stand up for things I don't like controversy I'll be the last one to be dragged into a controversy but if a man says the days of Miracles are passed that man's a liar if the Bible said he gives another example if the Bible said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and every place now watch where he takes this every place in the Bible says the same thing so now here's a principle that we can use if there's a word Doctrine every place in the Bible is going to say the same thing right and that's why we know we can stand on it we've all through the Bible we can find Jesus name baptism baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right and so we look at that and someone comes baptizing differently we know he's not saying what a prophet said and he's not saying what the Bible says because once it exists in the scripture you don't get to just cut it out are you with me now and that's why we've got to be careful about what we try to reason in our minds about the message of the hour about the Scriptures it stands on its own right right if it's all through the scriptures I don't get to just ignore it I gotta come to it just like you do I got to conform to it so now he says that every place in the Bible says the same thing and everybody that was Earth are you still with me tonight I've got a few more minutes and you don't know how many a few is I don't either I'll just so everybody that was ever baptized in the Bible I've missed you brother Joel I tell you what every there was ever baptized in the Bible time was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he commissions them to be baptized sprinkled or something else like that he said that man is a liar he's found out to be a false prophet and it's not because you hate the man but he's not telling the truth right come are you with me now so the angel commends that that church age he tells them he said tell the Ephesian Church age you found them who called themselves Apostles and they were not and you said you're a liar now we could take that to anything uh one of the things that we're taking her to today and and again we've tried to uh tried to show people in a kind way but but these things there's some things when somebody goes in tries to take ministers out of the church deny Ephesians 4 11 and all the other scriptures that speak of pastors and apostles and Prophets and evangelists and teachers what are we supposed to tell them are you with me now if they're going to take out something that's all through the scriptures and all through the message well I won't say it but that's what he said are you with me now those who've called themselves Apostles yeah but you've tried them and they've found that they're not Apostles because they don't stay with the word I've got personal experience with this I remember when I was a teenager and my own father and and brother Brandon writes about this in the church age book and this helped me so much because my own father was saying things about the message it just weren't true and as I began to dig into the message for myself I realized he's not staying with the word and my first thought was being young and naive I thought well I'm going to go tell him and he's going to change what he's teaching because he just don't know so this 14 year old boy goes and tries to tell his dad and you know how that goes go knock your head against the wall you know you're a 14 year old boy and so I was naive in that way but I had to stay with the word it's not what brother Brandon said brother Brandon brother Brandon said certain things but he didn't say what you're saying and you you've all experienced times like that you had to make a stand huh and this this passage really helped me so I'm going to read it to you he said he reads the scripture that I found them that say they are Apostles and are not has found them Liars he said my that is a blunt statement the US tried them who called themselves Apostles isn't that presumptuous what right has the people to try those who call themselves apostles now look some people would say none well you're not a pastor but it wasn't the pastors going out and calling these Apostles Liars it was the church yeah right maybe including some pastors but it was the church he said how do they try them he said oh I love this here it is in Galatians 1 8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be accursed he said it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a DOT or a dash of it that's what our soul hangs on do you believe that tonight can you see that our soul hangs on that that's why our women I wear long hair they don't do it because a preacher said do it right not even because a prophet said do it but it was in the word and a word Prophet called us back to the word that's why our women don't cut their hair because we have a revelation that God's word is true and the Bible says that a woman's hair was given to her for her covering and so and for her not to even pray without her covering I don't know why I'm going into that but maybe you question that and sometimes you wonder why why do I have to deal with that why why am I having to wear my long hair like it is and and why why do I leave it alone when others can go and cut it off like they do and beautify it in whatever way that they want to because it was given to to the woman for a covenant and I don't have time to go into all of that but it was what the word says it's the way God wants it we don't get to just change it and if you can change one thing you can change another if you can change it that about hair you can change what he said about homosexuals yeah yeah right and that's what the modern church is fighting with today because they're standing for Romans 1 but not for First Corinthians 11. right they can't they can't do it but we must stand for all the word we want to stand for everything that was written and so they fight that battle today but we if we're going to take one word out we might as well throw the whole thing away because it's only as good as its weakest link but the Brandon said it was a chain the word is a chain we're hanging over hell with it and I'm back to this quote he said even if I he said he said Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come even if I come and try to give a second revelation try to make one little change in what I gave originally let me be accursed you see Paul knew that first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation then in second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind now he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and later designated that seed had to come through Abraham then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David but it was the same Revelation yes it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed that's right hey man he said and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word those Ephesians knew that the word that word as Paul had taught it they knew that word as Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false right I can't tell you the comfort that that provided to me as a Young Man because I I knew enough to be respectful I I can honestly say I don't think my kids can necessarily say this but I can honestly say I never talk back to my dad one time about anything but the word of God I can ever remember God help me if that's not true true statement but my dad too was not a man that you talked back to he just wasn't he uh dad was you you didn't get a second chance but but when it comes to the word what am I supposed to do yeah right the word is it's got to be true or we don't have anything right right we don't have anything without the word so he said you're they looked him right in the eye and said you're not saying what Paul said you are therefore false he said oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word he said it is not you that really tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them right wait a minute you said well nobody can try a prophet that's not what he said yes yes said it's not you that tries the Apostle and Prophet yeah yeah right because there's not another Messenger to the age right if there's one who comes and says he's a prophet today we get to try them the same way they did see if they're speaking what Paul said what brother Branham said he said it is the word that tries them one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the Legacy and church age I love the way he puts this he's trying to let people know without saying it's him but he says one of these days but we believe he fulfilled that he said one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the laodicean church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one I owed he said in that last page when there will be many false prophets appearing many he said watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you'll be lost he said but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he's truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you're lost he won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation but on the word amen amen this last thing that I thought of we don't want to rebuild these walls how how do we stay away from that stay in Revival yes there's always there's always a correlation between denominationalism and a lack of Revival when the Revival dies down then they build walls now again I know there's not going to be a sweeping Revival so we have to be that much more on guard because there's not a Revival to be caught up in in the sense of a sleeping Revival but there is a bride Revival that's going on right now right and but but look at Ahab why could Heil do what he did because he had a back-sid king he had a backsid king and that's who didn't care about the word anymore and by the way that's how you know if Revival is struck yeah can I just talk to you for a minute yeah you don't know that you're in Revival because people are running all over the building yes you know that you're in Revival because people care about the word again yes that's right that's how you know if you're in Revival no they they will shout they will run they'll do whatever the people will I was listening to uh the other day when the World Cup team won they come in they come into the hotel and they put it on social media and I was I watched part of it when they come in that hotel that people screamed and shouted because America won America won against Iran you should have heard the people they were overwhelmed by Joy I thought then they get mad at us because we want to shout in church we got something to shout about hey man we just get overwhelmed with joy but that's not the mark of Revival that's the effects of Revival but how you know you're in Revival is when you start caring about the word again the word says something you just do it you just follow it you you just go right into it you don't have to make yourself come to church you go to church why you're in Revival yeah amen and what did that first church as they begin to rebuild those walls in that early church that Antichrist Spirit came in yes yes and what did that what was the thing that they did they lost their first love he said now someone against me because I was left by first love the brothers said they lost their love for Holy Ghost meetings he said that fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out on the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal right he said that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal oh God help us not to have that formality come in among us because that's when Walls Start to go up that's when Fellowship begins to die now notice he said the abandoned abandonment to God was dying out the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them because they began to be careful about what the world thought of them and he talks about that second generation I don't have time he said that second generation began to drift where are we at church we're way more than two generations down but remember he said there has to be somebody who does not die there's got to be a real grain that breaks the cycle of Revival and death but he says that cycle of Revival and death has never failed notice he said it has never failed he doesn't say it would never fail because there's got to be a bride that breaks that cycle but that cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit when men and women dress like Christians went to church and prayed all night took the street corners weren't ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough money to build fine new churches they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir and there's nothing wrong with the choir but what's he saying they didn't want to be it participate anymore listen if you don't want to participate in church you're not in Revival if you ever get in Revival you don't care who's around you brother Brandon said a Revival he said it's not what you do in church he said if you're in Revival he said you could be standing there washing the dishes and the tears begin to come down your face and when you begin to Worship the Lord while you're in Revival yes sir it's too strong for a Wednesday night I I'm not going to preach to you Sunday brother Timothy is now look don't let somebody do your worship for you yeah he said they organized the movement ran up by man they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and goats came in and took over Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is about all that is left he said a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God in John 5 first John 5 and 3 he said for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments his word one little deviation from that word was a step away from Christ are you hear me today don't you want to stay close to him don't you need him in your hour of trouble don't you need him in every moment of your life one little deviation from the word is a step away from Christ oh I want to stay with that word don't you I want us to stay with that word because I want us to be close to him people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing have a great emotional time but when it's all over watch and see if they're in that word walking in and living in it if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story he said I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people saying they love God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian Church something is happening to you someone is trying to either add to that word or take from it but they're doing it so subtly that you can't see it they haven't made a move so big that you can see it out there in the open it's undercover they're bringing it by way of reason and human understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it it will take over unless you refuse it unless you're willing to stand up and say these this is a liar are you with me now we will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late but as usual people don't hate God's warning a Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful listen as I'm closing the manifestation of the spirit so blessed that a little fear Creeps in they love it so much you realize you're if excuse me brother Stewart but I was concerned about your son when he was lost the other day in the laundry basket not as concerned as his mama was I can guarantee you that why because that's her baby she loves him with a different kind of love are you with me now you lose your kid and you can call me and tell me and I'll pray and I'll be concerned but not the way you will be are you hearing me now why because you have a different kind of love and and so it belongs to you and I understood this this love that's there and sometimes what we love we want to protect don't we yes we want to protect it but in doing that when it comes to the word we've got to be careful not to rebuild the walls and say well I'll protect it by not fellowshipping with anybody that's not going to protect you building walls doesn't protect you because everything that can be shaken will be shaken down and all those walls become is something that holds you in keeps you from moving on Christ he said the manifestation of the spirit is so blessed just look at what's happened in the message of the hour we had a wonderful prophet a wonderful message are you with me tonight but that little fear Creeps in a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on maybe we should form a group of men and start dictating what people preach maybe we should just quit listening to Ministry altogether just stay with the tapes fear creeping in a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect the truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize and set up your Creed of what you believe you see many people will separate with you not over the word but over their Creed a Creed is something you built walls you built to protect the word yeah they're not separating because of the word they're separating because of their idea of the word they set up a Creed around the word and they said well we're protecting it we're keeping ourselves pure no you're killing it yeah yeah organizing set up your creative what you believe put it all in a church manual and they do it they won't let their young people fellowship with anybody they won't let are you with me tonight we don't want to ever do that they won't hear nobody outside their own little group they organized they had to the word and they died just like Eve did for taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life and it's not what we say about the word that counts but it's what God Said do we believe that tonight hey man musicians go ahead and come how many can say I want that Revival to burn in my heart I want that Revival to burn in My Heart Lord help me I don't want to build walls I don't want to protect Lord I know you can protect it you can protect if you tore it down there's a reason why you tore it down let me move on Lord let me go on into the land don't let me be like hail because I may have a beautiful wall but I've lost my children my Creed may be intact but my children are gone you imagine how he must have felt if he ever read that scripture brother Harvey If you ever went back to judges and read what Joshua said he told me it would happen and I'm sitting here my walls look good he let him build the walls he didn't shake them down again but he lost his children God help us today let's stay open yeah I know it's easy to get hurt when you're open You're vulnerable it's easy to get hurt when you love people but let's let's stay loving let's keep that brotherly love for one another let's not build walls around creeps let's let's say what a prophet said but if there's somebody that stands up and says something different and it's off the word not some little thing but something that's off the word and stand up and say that's a lying spirit and we need to identify it as such bow your heads with me if that that thing that tells you you can't make it you know that's a lie why don't you point your finger in that Devil's face tonight and say that's you're a lying spirit a thing that tells you that well I'm just going to quit Church nobody cares about me anyway it's a lie it's a lying Apostle that's not what the word says the word says you're going to make it the word says that he'll provide you pastors after his own heart the word says he'll give you Shepherds the word said he'll love you the word said but you can get looking on the outside on the Flesh and you begin to wonder well does anybody care but listen to what the word says and if you find something that's not with the word he says you can never be well look at that devil in the face and tell him you're a liar the doctor May say I have cancer but the word says I'm Healed the doctor May say I have heart trouble but the word says I'm Healed the devil may say I'll never make it but the word says I'll be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord I believe the word Paul put himself right there he said we which are alive and remain let me have that kind of Faith Lord the prayer said if one's going to make it out of my city let me be that one I'll be that one I'll Stand For Truth amen Heavenly Father oh God we believe that your word is true every other work man's word is a lie but your word is true Lord we believe your word today Lord we look every every demon Spirit every everything that would be against the word today we look it in the face we tell it you can't have my children you don't have a right to my family you don't have a right to my house I'm not building walls again I'm not going to let bitterness creep in I'm not going to let let this complex take over my life but I'm going to stand for for truth I'm gonna be open I'm gonna be vulnerable I'm gonna be honest I'm going to love like you love Lord the Lord help us to stand up and say it today or to believe it with all of our hearts I pray you granted Lord thank you for these people who sit patiently Lord may you bless them especially tonight Lord as I feel your presence here with us may may you just bless them especially with your presence not not just here in the church but when we go home Lord May there just be a desire for your word that fervent
