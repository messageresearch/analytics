[39:43] I'll say this while you're turning to
[39:45] Joel chapter 3 I
[39:47] hey those kids I think it's going to
[39:49] surprise you the way they come back from
[39:52] camp and I don't say that lightly you
[39:54] know people can go to Camp it's not camp
[39:55] that does anything anything but I
[39:57] watched those kids just open up and
[39:59] really receive from the Lord and uh some
[40:02] of them I never thought I'd I'd never
[40:04] see them get a move out of them in
[40:06] church you know and just the presence of
[40:09] the Lord fell on them and the Word was
[40:11] preached and and some things that needed
[40:13] to be preached needed to be said and and
[40:16] they received it and I was so grateful
[40:17] to see that and you know you got to come
[40:19] up to a point in your life where you
[40:21] decide uh what who you're going to serve
[40:25] I want to talk about that this morning
[40:26] morning as well I want to talk to us
[40:27] adults this morning about that about the
[40:30] valley of decision but the kids have to
[40:32] have to receive that too and I I just
[40:34] see them I see them making that choice I
[40:37] I'm going to serve the Lord I I'm going
[40:39] to believe the message I I I'm going to
[40:41] do what's right and I I love to see that
[40:43] I want to see all of us do that I think
[40:45] it'd help our youth if some of us would

[42:03] valley of
[42:04] Jehoshaphat

[42:09] decision for the day of the Lord is near
[42:13] in the valley of decision I pray the
[42:15] Lord would add his Blessing to the word
[42:17] you may be seated this
[42:20] morning we've been talking about how God
[42:22] builds us as
[42:24] individuals and how he calls Us and how
[42:26] that began before the world ever began
[42:30] that that we are predestined to be what
[42:32] we are and and we there's a seed down
[42:35] inside of us and and and it's something
[42:37] that that God placed there that allows
[42:40] us to uh to be what we are we can't be
[42:43] what we are you can't make yourself
[42:44] elect you can't be what you are and live
[42:47] as a Christian in this day unless
[42:48] there's something there you you can't
[42:50] even desire God andless God Pricks your
[42:53] heart and there's something there that
[42:55] wants God oh aren't you glad aren't you
[42:57] glad there's something in you that wants
[42:59] God today but but that that has to be
[43:02] there there's got to be a a desire there
[43:05] and God deals with you as an individual
[43:07] in that way but there's got to come a
[43:09] time in your life where you come to a
[43:12] fork in the road if I could say it that
[43:14] way or you come to a a a way a place
[43:17] where two ways meet and and you got to
[43:20] go either one way or the other if you
[43:22] ever come to a tea in the road you
[43:24] realize that you either got to go right
[43:26] or left if you as long if you're going
[43:28] forward you got to go one way or the
[43:30] other you you you can't you can't back
[43:32] up you can't uh you you can't just sit
[43:35] there in the road you got to move and
[43:37] you got to go one way or the other and
[43:40] and and when uh Joel is talking speaking
[43:42] in Prophecy he's seeing a place that the
[43:46] world came to that the Gentile World
[43:48] brother the Jason would come to a place
[43:50] where they were actually had reached a
[43:52] place that they they had made their
[43:55] decision and they were in the valley of
[43:57] decision and they' made their decision
[43:59] and they they they' wandered into this
[44:01] Valley and here they were and he said
[44:03] come to the he said and now he said it's
[44:06] multitudes in the valley of decision
[44:08] he's speaking of a gentile age that's
[44:09] made their decision and then he said now
[44:11] God's going to decide what to do with
[44:14] them right they've made their decision
[44:17] and I think if we look around us today
[44:19] we we we'd realize that that America's
[44:22] made a decision they they've turned down
[44:24] the gospel they they did that 1956 they
[44:27] turned down the gospel and the world the
[44:30] Gentile world has made a decision
[44:32] they've turned down the gospel aren't
[44:34] you glad that you made a decision to be
[44:36] the Bride of Jesus Christ you said I
[44:37] couldn't make myself that no but the
[44:39] bride will choose to follow him the
[44:42] bride will choose to believe the message
[44:44] the bride will choose to follow the
[44:48] word so you have to come to that fork in
[44:50] the road and the world has come to a
[44:53] place oh if I could just
[44:56] I come home this weekend because I
[44:58] wanted to preach this to you and I hope
[45:00] I I can get it to you the way it is in
[45:01] my heart the world is reached a place
[45:04] where they they they've reached this tea
[45:06] in the road and and and they realize
[45:09] they can't go anywhere else they can't
[45:10] go any further and so they've reached
[45:12] this place they've made their decision
[45:15] and and and they've made a decision that
[45:17] they're not going to serve the Lord and
[45:19] so it's time for God to decide what to
[45:21] do with them and and and the only way
[45:23] they can go is the way they've decided
[45:25] to go which is the path to hell and and
[45:29] the path to the tribulation period And
[45:31] so when they step this way they're gone
[45:34] one
[45:36] step the wrong
[45:38] direction and they're
[45:40] gone and it's the only way they can go
[45:43] because as a whole I'm talking as a
[45:45] group now we believe there's still elect
[45:46] out there there's people out there that
[45:48] want to serve the Lord but as a whole
[45:50] the group is headed down the wrong
[45:52] direction and all it's just one step
[45:54] away one breath away away one one day
[45:57] away one hour away from the tribulation
[46:01] period the world sitting there at that
[46:03] place this morning oh if I can only get
[46:06] you to realize what what this hour is
[46:09] only get you to recognize what what time
[46:12] it is in in the times of God in the end
[46:14] times now the day of the Lord is at hand
[46:17] in the valley of
[46:18] decision Joel 3:15 says the sun and the
[46:21] moon shall be darkened and the Stars
[46:23] shall withdraw their shining the Lord
[46:25] Lord also shall Roar out of Zion what
[46:28] does that mean he's changed from a lamb
[46:30] to a
[46:31] lion right the Lord will Roar out of
[46:33] Zion utter his voice from Jerusalem and
[46:35] the heavens and the Earth shall Shake
[46:37] but the Lord will be the hope of his
[46:39] people and the strength of the children
[46:41] of Israel
[46:43] amen Joel is saying the day of the Lord
[46:45] is at hand you're standing in the valley
[46:48] of judgment or decision the Lord is
[46:50] going to decide what to do with the
[46:52] Gentiles this is the day of the Lord to
[46:55] close of the end times the end of the
[46:57] Gentile age listen Isaiah speaks of it
[47:00] in Isaiah 13:9 behold the day of the
[47:02] Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and
[47:04] fierce anger to lay the land desolate
[47:06] and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof
[47:08] out of it for the stars of Heaven and
[47:10] the constellations thereof shall not
[47:12] give their light the sun shall be
[47:13] darkened and is going forth the moon
[47:15] shall not cause her light to shine and I
[47:17] will punish the world for their evil and
[47:19] the wicked for their iniquity I will
[47:20] cause the arrogancy of The Proud to
[47:22] cease and will lay low the hotess of the
[47:24] terrible those who were too arogant
[47:26] those who are too proud to come to an
[47:28] altar those who are too proud to come
[47:30] and believe the message of the hour
[47:31] those who are too proud to dress like a
[47:33] Christian act like a Christian that and
[47:35] that day he's going to destroy the pride
[47:37] will lay low the Hess of the terrible he
[47:40] said therefore I will shake the heavens
[47:42] and the Earth shall remove out of her
[47:43] place in the Wrath of the Lord of hosts
[47:45] in the day of his Fierce anger oh I'm so
[47:49] glad that I don't you see but what makes
[47:51] it where you don't have to live in that
[47:54] you stood at that Crossroad
[47:56] and you went on into the baptism of the
[47:58] Holy Ghost you went on in to be the
[48:00] bride of Christ you went on into the
[48:02] message of the hour you went on into the
[48:05] ark
[48:07] amen oh
[48:10] my now
[48:11] look Malachi puts it this way for behold
[48:14] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[48:17] oven we're right there church one
[48:21] step one
[48:23] step all it is just turn this way
[48:27] walk this step I want you to think about
[48:29] that as as a
[48:30] generation they just it's got the last
[48:34] 10 years have been
[48:36] nuts the last 20 years some of you have
[48:38] lived the last 50
[48:40] years what what in the world's going
[48:44] on but the Kevin has just gone
[48:46] crazy and why is the world gone crazy
[48:49] why is the devil fighting the people of
[48:51] God like he is why does he fight the
[48:53] message of the hour like he is today
[48:55] I'll say this we shouldn't fight one
[48:57] another the devil's doing a good job of
[48:59] it we just leave that
[49:02] alone but why is the devil fighting the
[49:04] message like he is why does he why does
[49:06] he come in your mind and fight you like
[49:07] he does the day is coming that's right
[49:10] he don't have he don't have very long he
[49:12] knows he don't have very long we're
[49:14] living in that time the day cometh that
[49:16] shall burn us an oven and all the proud
[49:18] and they that do wickedly shall be
[49:19] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[49:20] burn them up say the Lord of host it
[49:22] shall leave them neither root nor Branch
[49:25] but to you that fear my name shall the
[49:27] son of righteousness arise with healing
[49:29] in his wings brother bam says with
[49:31] healing campaigns healing in his wings
[49:34] and you shall go forth and grow up as
[49:36] calvs of the stall and you shall tread
[49:38] down the wicked for they shall be ashes
[49:40] under the SES of your feet in the day
[49:42] that I shall do this sayith the Lord of
[49:43] host Remember You The Law of Moses my
[49:45] servant which I commanded unto him an
[49:47] hore for all Israel with the statutes
[49:48] and judgments now watch what he's saying
[49:50] there's going to be a day when mercy
[49:52] lifts off of the Earth when the Holy
[49:54] Spirit is lifted from the Earth he that
[49:55] now leth will let until the man of sin
[49:58] comes and when he does that the iniquity
[50:00] iniquity is full and the spirit is
[50:02] lifted and then the law comes back into
[50:05] effect and who can live the
[50:07] law oh I thank God for Grace today I
[50:11] thank God there's still Grace I thank
[50:12] God that I made my decision I made my
[50:14] choice I've taken the right
[50:18] route trust you have as
[50:21] well oh that ought to make us this
[50:23] message not a message of of of of
[50:26] hardship or a message of that keeps you
[50:28] down or a message of legalism is a
[50:30] message of
[50:32] Grace
[50:34] Grace we either believe these things or
[50:36] we don't and I want you to look at this
[50:38] he says Remember You The Law of Moses
[50:41] behold I will send
[50:46] you who's he talking to who's he talking
[50:49] talking to
[50:51] you you young people I was listening to
[50:53] young people at camp and these are even
[50:55] younger but some of them will be going
[50:56] maybe next year if we if it Lord carries
[50:58] we this camp in Oklahoma's close enough
[51:00] we can support it and I've tried to do
[51:02] that and I have confidence brother wle
[51:03] and the people there that are running it
[51:05] but as brother Andrew Glover was
[51:07] preaching this weekend preaching
[51:08] preaching about the opening of the word
[51:10] and things to the young people but but
[51:12] they're the ones that have to receive it
[51:15] you've got to come to a place that he
[51:17] sent you Elijah the prophet and this
[51:19] message is for you and and it belongs to
[51:21] you and you can accept it you may not
[51:24] understand every little piece of it but
[51:25] you believe
[51:26] it it's for
[51:29] you now
[51:31] look behold I'll send you Elijah the
[51:34] prophet he sent him to me this message
[51:37] was not sent to just everybody it was
[51:39] sent to me
[51:41] personally it came that's why I can't
[51:43] leave it that's why I can't doubt it
[51:44] that's why I can't turn away from it it
[51:46] came to me that's why I preach it I know
[51:49] people don't like me using quotes all
[51:50] the time reading quotes I do that
[51:52] because because it's it's who I am him
[51:56] this message God was speaking to
[51:59] me
[52:04] sir before the coming now watch Elijah
[52:07] comes before the coming of the great and
[52:11] Dreadful day of the
[52:13] Lord and he shall
[52:15] turn I like I love that it'll be his
[52:18] ministry that does it he shall turn the
[52:20] heart of the fathers to the children and
[52:23] the Heart of the children to the fathers
[52:25] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[52:28] curse we're living in that time and we
[52:30] know John the Baptist didn't fulfill
[52:31] that scripture because he he the day of
[52:34] the Lord was not at hand at that time
[52:36] but now the day of the Lord is at hand
[52:39] right what was at hand then was the age
[52:40] of Grace but now what's at hand is the
[52:43] end of the age of
[52:46] Grace I want you to listen to me this
[52:48] morning I don't want to make you
[52:49] uncomfortable but it shouldn't make us
[52:51] uncomfortable if we're Believers but if
[52:53] we're not Believers if we're standing at
[52:55] that place where we don't know whether
[52:57] we're going to go stay in church or not
[52:59] we don't know whether it's right or not
[53:00] we don't know whether we should dress
[53:02] like he taught us to and act like he
[53:03] taught us to and live like he taught us
[53:05] to and treat people like he taught we
[53:07] don't know whether it's really right or
[53:08] wrong if you're standing in that place
[53:10] this morning you should be uncomfortable
[53:13] because that's where the world
[53:14] is in the valley of
[53:17] decision you got to
[53:20] move you got to move into the message of
[53:22] the hour or move into the tribulation
[53:24] period a one of the two even the saved
[53:29] Baptist Methodist people like that
[53:30] they're good saved people out there
[53:32] that's right that that believe on Jesus
[53:34] but they can't see the message of the
[53:36] hour they go through the tribulation
[53:38] period it's one or the other you don't
[53:40] it's either Rapture or
[53:43] tribulation one or the
[53:45] other we're living in that time I want
[53:47] you to understand that the message of
[53:49] the hour came as it was God's Arc it was
[53:52] God's Deliverance it was a message of
[53:54] Deliverance to bring bring us away from
[53:56] those things and I want to ask you this
[53:57] morning have you decided or are you
[53:59] standing at the crossroads do you know
[54:01] what who you believe do you know do you
[54:03] know why you go to church do you know
[54:06] why you come to the house of God you
[54:07] know why you even listen to tapes you
[54:09] may listen but do you know why you
[54:11] listen have you decided have you made
[54:13] your choice to stand there if your
[54:15] family doesn't see it if nobody else
[54:17] sees it if if the world doesn't see it
[54:19] no matter how they treat you you're
[54:21] going to stand for the message of the
[54:22] hour not because anybody's standing with
[54:25] you but because it's
[54:33] right entire Gentile World standing in
[54:38] limbo you know what limbo is the Greeks
[54:40] come up with limbo it was kind of the
[54:42] idea of purgatory to the Catholics you
[54:44] know it's just it's neither Heaven Nor
[54:47] Hell we don't believe in purgatory but
[54:49] the world is standing in
[54:51] limbo right what that what that means is
[54:54] they they don't know what they believe
[54:56] they don't know where they stand they
[54:58] don't know what's coming and fears on
[55:01] them but the I Bible says men's Hearts
[55:04] will fail for fear at the end time and
[55:06] we're seeing that time entire Gentile
[55:09] World standing in limbo waiting to see
[55:11] what judgment will come from the Lord
[55:14] because they passed
[55:15] mercy and so they wait to see what
[55:17] judgment but you and I are not waiting
[55:19] to see judgment we're waiting to see a
[55:21] body change we're not waiting for we're
[55:24] not waiting for for a time when when for
[55:26] of tribulation we're not prepping for
[55:28] tribulation we're prepping to get out of
[55:32] here are you with me this
[55:34] morning so they're waiting to see what
[55:36] judgment will come from the
[55:38] Lord now and you look at that sometimes
[55:41] and I know you got to make your decision
[55:43] and it's hard because sometimes you look
[55:44] at the world say well they they live
[55:46] better than I do and and they have more
[55:48] fun than I do or at least it looks that
[55:50] way on Facebook and and it looks like
[55:52] they're just enjoying life and here I've
[55:54] always had this conviction ition and I I
[55:56] want to serve the Lord and yet I see
[55:58] people in the world living like they do
[55:59] well you know David went through that or
[56:02] actually I think this was a Psalm of
[56:03] ASAP but he was standing there and he
[56:05] was looking and and he went through a
[56:07] place where uh where he thought well the
[56:10] world's going that way maybe I maybe I
[56:12] just go that way he didn't understand it
[56:14] and so he said this in Psalm 73 he said
[56:16] truly God is good to Israel even to such
[56:19] as are of a clean heart but as for me my
[56:22] feet were almost gone now some of youall
[56:26] I know you have the baptism of the Holy
[56:27] Ghost you've been filled you've been
[56:29] sealed to the day of your Redemption and
[56:31] yet you stand in a place sometimes where
[56:33] you begin to wonder I wonder what's
[56:34] going on I wonder what's going to happen
[56:36] I wonder what's next I wonder I wonder
[56:38] if we're going to make it I wonder if if
[56:40] if if the message you'll Satan will
[56:41] introduce that to your mind and he has a
[56:44] right to your mind that's no man's land
[56:46] but he don't have a right to stay there
[56:49] because you're a born again believer so
[56:51] you can kick him out of your mind and
[56:53] and and Paul says whatever exalts itself
[56:55] against the knowledge of Christ kick it
[56:57] out tear down every stronghold of
[57:00] something that would be against the word
[57:02] amen but you stand there like like Asaf
[57:04] here in this Psalm and he's standing
[57:06] there and he's saying my feet were
[57:07] almost gone my steps had well not
[57:10] slipped for I was envious at the foolish
[57:14] when I saw the prosperity of the wicked
[57:17] they can be happy and their families are
[57:18] happy and everything's just fine and you
[57:20] look at other the people today you look
[57:22] at people they can they can be they can
[57:24] commit unspeakable acts and be rich
[57:28] right and increase with goods and it
[57:31] seems like the worst they are the more
[57:33] better off they
[57:34] are God don't deal with you that way and
[57:37] there's a reason why he don't because
[57:39] you're the elect of God and every time
[57:41] you mess up something happens and you're
[57:43] checked and and some what is it the
[57:45] mercy of
[57:47] God you're corrected and and God doesn't
[57:49] judge you but he corrects you now now
[57:52] look he said that's for me my feet were
[57:54] almost gone was envious at the foolish
[57:56] when I saw the prosperity of the wicked
[57:58] for there are no bands in their death
[58:00] but their strength is firm in other
[58:01] words it seem like they seem like they
[58:03] just die they don't they don't worry
[58:04] about it they're not in trouble as other
[58:06] men neither are they plagued like other
[58:08] men therefore Pride compasses them about
[58:11] as a chain violence covers them as a
[58:13] garment jump down to verse 12 he said
[58:15] behold these are the ungodly who prosper
[58:18] in the world they increase in riches
[58:20] verely he said I've cleansed my heart in
[58:22] vain washed my hands in innocency no
[58:25] let's just be honest we've all felt that
[58:26] way sometimes it seem like the world
[58:28] just do whatever they want to and here
[58:29] we are as Christians struggling striving
[58:31] trying to do what's right and it seems
[58:33] like everything's against us and and the
[58:35] world just turned towards them and not
[58:36] towards us but remember what I told you
[58:38] if you believe the word that the the fix
[58:41] is in but it's not against you it's for
[58:44] you the the actually the whole creation
[58:47] is rigged for
[58:49] you but but it it's not it's for your
[58:52] good it's not for what you think you
[58:53] might want
[58:56] right so so he says these are the
[58:57] ungodly he said I've cleansed my heart
[59:00] he said all the day long I've been
[59:01] plagued and chastened every morning if I
[59:03] say I will speak thus behold now look
[59:06] he's saying I I have these things in my
[59:08] heart but if I talk about it now and
[59:11] this is important he said I should
[59:13] offend against the generation of thy
[59:14] children so in other words if I sit here
[59:17] and complain right the kids are going to
[59:19] suffer from
[59:21] it if I have a bad attitude my my youth
[59:24] are going to suffer from it if if I'm
[59:27] not sure where I'm at you need to make
[59:29] sure you know cuz your kids know if you
[59:32] can't make up your mind your kids see
[59:34] that sir if you don't know whether you
[59:36] say well you know it seems like maybe we
[59:38] ought to just cut Corners here and we
[59:40] don't really have to live the message
[59:41] over here we can just do this or do that
[59:43] your kids see that they know whether
[59:45] you're cutting Corners they know what
[59:47] you're doing I'm so glad for I believe
[59:49] there will be a generation that'll sell
[59:50] out to the Lord I trust that's us this
[59:53] morning well sell out to this
[59:56] message might as well believe
[59:59] it right might as well believe
[1:00:03] it you know when you say something is
[1:00:05] true and you don't follow it people
[1:00:08] don't believe
[1:00:12] you well it's true but I just you know
[1:00:15] not for you know it's not real important
[1:00:19] ah truth is
[1:00:21] important truth is important if it's
[1:00:24] true it's important God said it there
[1:00:26] was a reason why he said it he said if I
[1:00:28] say it it'll offend the generation of
[1:00:30] the children yeah he was struggling in
[1:00:33] his
[1:00:34] heart I say this preachers have to watch
[1:00:37] that because sometimes we're our hearts
[1:00:39] are open when we're preaching and we
[1:00:41] just say whatever we whatever comes out
[1:00:43] and we got to be careful with that as we
[1:00:45] offend the children now look when I
[1:00:47] thought to know this it was too painful
[1:00:49] for me
[1:00:52] until I love this all right all right
[1:00:55] until I went to church brother westes
[1:00:58] yes I went into the sanctuary of God and
[1:01:01] it seemed like everything was going
[1:01:03] against me and it seemed like they just
[1:01:04] live any way they want to and prosper
[1:01:06] and I try to live a Christian Life and I
[1:01:08] get struggle after struggle after
[1:01:09] struggle but when I went to church when
[1:01:11] I went into the sanctuary of God then
[1:01:14] understood I there end he said I
[1:01:17] understood there's something coming for
[1:01:19] them surely he said thou did set them in
[1:01:22] Slippery places that's right they may
[1:01:25] they may be running down the road just
[1:01:27] as fast as they can go but there's ice
[1:01:29] on the road and they can't see it they
[1:01:31] don't know it they're going to fall and
[1:01:33] yet you walk down the road softly and
[1:01:35] carefully and it seems like you
[1:01:36] everything you do you're watching trying
[1:01:38] to live right trying to do what's right
[1:01:39] and they're just going full speed ahead
[1:01:41] but there's coming a place where it's
[1:01:44] slippery they're in Slippery places in
[1:01:46] fact if they if they passed in that sin
[1:01:50] brother BR talked about preaching the
[1:01:51] total lost and I don't want to get too
[1:01:53] far into that this morning but the world
[1:01:55] there are people who have passed Beyond
[1:01:57] even help and and they get to a place
[1:01:59] where it's just and I'm not talking
[1:02:00] about you this morning but people that
[1:02:02] don't want to be God anymore if you want
[1:02:04] God there's hope for you if you have a
[1:02:06] desire for God there's hope for you but
[1:02:09] but but these people that don't even
[1:02:11] desire anymore and they're just going as
[1:02:12] fast as they can and everything's going
[1:02:14] fine for them look at politics today
[1:02:16] look at the world today look at the
[1:02:17] church today do anything they want in
[1:02:20] the
[1:02:22] church and it just goes on
[1:02:24] nobody says anything but it's slippery
[1:02:29] places slippery places you can do what
[1:02:32] you want but it's a slippery
[1:02:35] Place go outside the word I'm not
[1:02:38] preaching at you this morning I'm not
[1:02:40] trying to hurt you I just I have a
[1:02:42] responsibility to declare the word of
[1:02:45] God I have a responsibility for myself
[1:02:48] to make sure that I follow word of God
[1:02:50] now look surely thou did set them in
[1:02:53] Slippery places
[1:02:55] thou castest them down into destruction
[1:02:57] how are they brought into desolation as
[1:02:58] in a moment they are utterly consumed
[1:03:01] with Terrors as a dream when one awaketh
[1:03:04] so oh Lord when thou awakes Thou shalt
[1:03:06] despise their image thus my heart was
[1:03:09] grieved he said I was pricked in my
[1:03:11] Reigns there's that word again I was
[1:03:13] pricked by the Holy Spirit he said
[1:03:15] because I was foolish so foolish was I
[1:03:19] and ignorant he said I was as a beast
[1:03:21] before thee nevertheless I love this he
[1:03:24] said even when I questioned even when I
[1:03:26] didn't understand even when I when I was
[1:03:28] about to go the wrong road you saved me
[1:03:30] from it aren't you glad for that today
[1:03:32] even when I went down even when I tried
[1:03:34] to do the things that were wrong you
[1:03:36] saved me you brought me back to the
[1:03:38] house of God why he said nevertheless I
[1:03:41] am continually with thee thou has Holden
[1:03:43] me by my right hand Thou shalt guide me
[1:03:46] with thy counsel and afterward receive
[1:03:48] me to Glory whom have I in heaven but
[1:03:50] thee there is none upon Earth that I
[1:03:52] desire beside thee Oh that ought be the
[1:03:54] Cry of our heart today we may not always
[1:03:56] understand why things are going like
[1:03:58] they're going we may not always
[1:04:00] understand what the world is going
[1:04:01] through and we may look out there and
[1:04:02] say well looks like they're doing pretty
[1:04:04] good maybe I should be more like them
[1:04:05] maybe I need more psychology maybe I
[1:04:07] need more of this that or the other
[1:04:08] maybe I need more maybe I need more what
[1:04:10] the world has maybe I need more fun
[1:04:12] maybe I need more alcohol maybe I need
[1:04:14] no no if you just look back and see that
[1:04:16] we depend upon the Lord whom have I in
[1:04:19] heaven but thee who there is none upon
[1:04:21] Earth that I desire beside thee
[1:04:24] My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is
[1:04:27] the strength of my heart and my portion
[1:04:33] forever they're slippery
[1:04:35] places Leo to is in the valley of
[1:04:38] decision not deciding whether to serve
[1:04:41] God they've already done that but God
[1:04:44] deciding what to do with
[1:04:47] them oh
[1:04:49] my Revelation
[1:04:51] 3:14 to the angel of the Church of the L
[1:04:54] is right these things sayth the amen the
[1:04:56] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:04:58] of the creation of God I Know Thy Works
[1:05:02] Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would
[1:05:04] thou W cold or hot so then because Thou
[1:05:06] Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[1:05:08] will spew thee out of my mouth because
[1:05:11] thou sayest I am rich and increase with
[1:05:14] Goods have need of nothing knowest not
[1:05:16] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[1:05:18] poor and blind and naked I counsel thee
[1:05:21] to buy me gold tried in the fire but th
[1:05:24] mayest be rich white rainment that thou
[1:05:26] mayest be clothed that the shame of thy
[1:05:28] nakedness do not appear anoint thine
[1:05:29] eyes with IA that thou mayest see he
[1:05:32] said as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:05:33] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[1:05:36] behold I stand at the door and
[1:05:39] knock now look the age has rejected him
[1:05:41] but he stands at your door this morning
[1:05:44] and he knocks because there's a hope for
[1:05:45] you there's a chance for you you're
[1:05:47] still in a in a place where you can make
[1:05:49] a
[1:05:50] decision even though the world as a
[1:05:52] whole has gone down but you're in a
[1:05:54] place where you can make a decision you
[1:05:56] can turn right go you can go into the
[1:05:57] tribulation period you can turn left and
[1:05:59] go or whichever direction that it is and
[1:06:01] go right into the presence of God one
[1:06:03] choice one one instant one moment can
[1:06:06] make all the difference that's right I
[1:06:09] tell you what I do because of the times
[1:06:11] that we stand in because of the slippery
[1:06:13] place that the world is in I'd make a
[1:06:15] choice for God this morning I'd choose
[1:06:17] to follow him I choose to raise my
[1:06:19] family in the fear and admonition of the
[1:06:21] Lord I choose to believe the message I
[1:06:23] choose to do what a prophet said why
[1:06:25] because I don't want to stand in
[1:06:27] Slippery places I want to stand under
[1:06:29] the anointing of a prophet of the age
[1:06:32] want to stand under the word under an
[1:06:34] open book been released in our day an
[1:06:38] anointing to stand put his feet on the
[1:06:40] land and the sea oh my oh my that's
[1:06:45] that's the anointing that's been
[1:06:46] released in our age Christ put his feet
[1:06:47] on the land in the sea shows he had
[1:06:49] dominion over
[1:06:51] everything amen
[1:06:55] look many folks Get Fooled I'm just
[1:06:58] talking to you this morning as a pastor
[1:07:00] are you with me this
[1:07:02] morning many folks are fooled because
[1:07:04] they have material
[1:07:06] things they don't realize they stand in
[1:07:08] the valley of
[1:07:09] decision material things is not the
[1:07:15] answer if you're not careful those
[1:07:16] material things keep you out of
[1:07:19] church and you say Well church doesn't
[1:07:21] save me that's true that's true but when
[1:07:24] I went into the
[1:07:25] sanctuary I got my perspective
[1:07:29] back when I went into the sanctuary all
[1:07:32] week long the world poured their uh
[1:07:34] their nonsense on me all week long the
[1:07:36] devil breathed his unbelief on me but
[1:07:38] when I went into the sanctuary I felt I
[1:07:41] knew that God was God again I knew that
[1:07:43] the presence of God was real I could
[1:07:45] feel him I saw my brothers and sisters
[1:07:48] they could live like I'm living listen
[1:07:49] if you have a struggle in your life an
[1:07:51] addiction you ought to be at the house
[1:07:52] of God every time the doors are open
[1:07:54] even if you're not you ought to be at
[1:07:55] the house of God brother if the love of
[1:07:57] God is in your heart you ought to be at
[1:07:58] the house of God every time the doors
[1:07:59] are open why because it's the hour we're
[1:08:02] living in it'll take you from a place of
[1:08:04] unbelief to a place of
[1:08:09] Faith are you hearing me today
[1:08:14] sir people don't realize they stand in
[1:08:16] the valley of
[1:08:18] decision make decisions every day the
[1:08:20] end of the world is upon us right when I
[1:08:23] think of this I think of Samson as he
[1:08:24] was standing there and and and every
[1:08:27] time remember he lied to Delilah but you
[1:08:29] can only play with Delilah so long right
[1:08:31] you'll give away your
[1:08:33] secret you just can't lie and theila is
[1:08:36] the type of the world you just can't
[1:08:38] wait in the place of decision for that
[1:08:40] long you got to decide to give up
[1:08:43] Delilah and walk with the Lord but
[1:08:45] Samson gave the Lord his strength he
[1:08:47] gave him his muscles but he didn't give
[1:08:48] him his heart he gave Delilah his heart
[1:08:53] and he stood in that place and in such a
[1:08:54] place that he felt like that he was
[1:08:56] invincible in such a place he felt like
[1:08:58] well I'm the elected and he was sir I'm
[1:09:01] the Nazarite and he was I'm the one and
[1:09:04] I've done all these things and he had
[1:09:07] he' shouted in church he he he trusted
[1:09:09] God he believed he' been to the all he
[1:09:11] he' done all the things that believers
[1:09:13] do on now but he also played around with
[1:09:16] the
[1:09:18] world what did he
[1:09:21] do he finally gave her his secet SEC and
[1:09:25] she cut his hair off his hair was a sign
[1:09:27] of his Nazarite vow she cut his hair off
[1:09:29] when she did he he woke out of his sleep
[1:09:32] and he said well I'll you know I've been
[1:09:33] backslid but I'll go to church today and
[1:09:35] I'll come back and I'll feel the
[1:09:37] presence of God like I always did I'll
[1:09:39] be able to go listen it won't always
[1:09:40] happen that
[1:09:43] way well I know all week I've lived for
[1:09:46] the devil but now I'm I I'll correct it
[1:09:48] this morning I'll do it TR this morning
[1:09:50] it don't always happen that
[1:09:52] way she he gave away his secret and so
[1:09:55] he he said now he said I'm going to go
[1:09:56] out as at other times before I'm going
[1:09:58] to go Worship the Lord I'm going to go
[1:10:00] lift my hands but he gets in church and
[1:10:02] he realized he has no power to overcome
[1:10:04] the devil anymore he don't even have the
[1:10:06] power to want to go to church anymore he
[1:10:08] don't want to have the power to even
[1:10:09] want to be a Christian
[1:10:11] anymore he wish not that the Lord was
[1:10:16] departed from him he was so
[1:10:19] backslid laying in the lap of Delilah
[1:10:22] that he didn't even know
[1:10:25] he was
[1:10:29] backslid I want you to know this morning
[1:10:31] he's he said brother Ben well I'm
[1:10:33] waiting on that persecution to come down
[1:10:34] on the church and then I'll I'll make
[1:10:37] things right if you're waiting on a
[1:10:38] physical persecution to make your
[1:10:39] decision it'll never happen until it's
[1:10:41] too
[1:10:46] late you know there's a squeeze on
[1:10:48] today there's a squeeze but but it's
[1:10:51] like the famine that's on today right
[1:10:53] right he said it's not for bread and
[1:10:55] water it's not for material things it's
[1:10:58] for the hearing of the word of the Lord
[1:11:00] there's a squeeze on today brother
[1:11:04] brandom explains it in and we got time
[1:11:06] this morning we just got one service
[1:11:08] y'all bear with me I saw some of y'all's
[1:11:10] kids sitting out there last night but
[1:11:12] brother Joel sent me a picture of them
[1:11:14] sitting there after four hours of church
[1:11:15] still worshiping God most everybody else
[1:11:18] had left but they're still worshiping
[1:11:20] God I think we could worship him for an
[1:11:21] hour this morning anyway don't you think
[1:11:25] I believe his presence is here I believe
[1:11:26] his word is here do you love him this
[1:11:28] morning did you bring him with you I
[1:11:30] believe he's
[1:11:31] here amen now
[1:11:35] look he said there's a squeeze but it's
[1:11:39] not it's not what you think it is look
[1:11:42] brother randam always talked about a
[1:11:43] squeeze how they the doors they lock the
[1:11:45] doors and things like that but in Feast
[1:11:47] of the trumpets now remember up to this
[1:11:49] time brother brandom brother brandom
[1:11:51] thought that the trumpets would be
[1:11:52] something that that he could preach and
[1:11:55] would be applicable in some way to the
[1:11:57] church when he preaches Feast to the
[1:11:59] trumpets he said it's to the Jews yes
[1:12:02] right but there is a there's a side of
[1:12:04] it now the same thing that happens under
[1:12:06] the trumpets to the Jews happens under
[1:12:08] the seals to the bride right so so now
[1:12:11] in but it's in a spiritual form right so
[1:12:14] what's released under the seventh
[1:12:15] trumpet say the Jews released under the
[1:12:17] seventh seal to the bride so he types
[1:12:19] that now he says this he said what does
[1:12:21] that thing stand for he's talking about
[1:12:22] the Ecom iCal influence let me back up I
[1:12:25] I skipped down he said notice the
[1:12:27] loosening of this ecclesiastical Spirit
[1:12:29] what is ecclesiastical or he uses the
[1:12:31] word ecclesiastical or ecumenical what
[1:12:34] does that mean it's the worldwide
[1:12:36] influence of the church it's it's it's
[1:12:39] we're all we're all the same we'll all
[1:12:40] come together and and do that now
[1:12:42] brother BR is not preaching about
[1:12:44] Fellowship he's not preaching against
[1:12:45] fellowship with message people what he's
[1:12:48] preaching against is The ecumenical
[1:12:49] worldwide move that's on right now now
[1:12:52] look he said said notice the loosing of
[1:12:54] this ecclesiastical Spirit now 20 years
[1:12:56] later after that war we see the loosing
[1:12:58] he said what under the seventh seal the
[1:13:00] seventh trumpet to the Jew he said look
[1:13:02] at the Moon darkening out he said see it
[1:13:04] drawn out the son of man being drove
[1:13:05] from the church oh God what is it
[1:13:09] joining in with the ecclesiastical Bunch
[1:13:10] The ecumenical move with the World
[1:13:12] Council of churches he said has drove
[1:13:14] Every Man Has drove yes now watch he
[1:13:19] said what does that thing stand for why
[1:13:20] you have to surrender all your
[1:13:22] Evangelical teachings and things how can
[1:13:24] two walk together L they be agreed they
[1:13:26] can't Jesus said they can't and how can
[1:13:28] a church the Methodist and Baptist walk
[1:13:30] together how can the Church of Christ
[1:13:31] walk with the Presbyterians how can the
[1:13:33] Catholic walk with the Protestant how
[1:13:34] can Protestant walk with Protestant see
[1:13:36] they're all different denominations
[1:13:37] they've all got different ideas he said
[1:13:40] but the bride can walk with the word if
[1:13:43] you walk with the word I can walk with
[1:13:45] you the bride can walk with the word
[1:13:47] which is Christ it must be an agreement
[1:13:49] not the ecclesiastical system but the
[1:13:51] word he said you have to agree with the
[1:13:53] the word to walk with the word Jesus
[1:13:55] said so that makes it right he said
[1:13:57] notice there she is now she's
[1:13:59] loosed now the same Devils remember in
[1:14:02] the Book of Revelation there were 200
[1:14:03] million I think it is Riders horse
[1:14:06] riders there's not that many horses
[1:14:08] maybe in all the world but but but there
[1:14:12] Spirits a horse is a
[1:14:14] power right a beast is a power they're
[1:14:17] spirits and they were released in the
[1:14:19] natural sense under the trumpets under
[1:14:22] the beginning of that to under Hitler
[1:14:24] and
[1:14:24] nightman right and they'll be released
[1:14:27] in a much greater way during the
[1:14:29] tribulation period but now watch the 200
[1:14:32] million released under Hitler to Hitler
[1:14:33] and nightman but they were also released
[1:14:36] under the seventh seal so the seventh
[1:14:38] seal is not open yet well you have a
[1:14:42] problem CU brother BR said they were
[1:14:44] released under the seventh
[1:14:46] seal right but they were released under
[1:14:48] the seventh seal on the
[1:14:50] bride he said no now there she is that's
[1:14:52] what he's talking about here he said now
[1:14:53] she's loosed all those demons that were
[1:14:56] sealed to the held to the end time amen
[1:14:59] that's why you see gay marriage legal
[1:15:01] today oh right that's why you see uh uh
[1:15:04] they won't stay with just being
[1:15:06] homosexual or lesbian they become a
[1:15:08] transgender and all of these things and
[1:15:10] they just keep on it just keeps getting
[1:15:12] worse and worse and worse and worse and
[1:15:16] worse it's been
[1:15:18] loosed but not just on the world on the
[1:15:21] bride but what's it been loosed on to
[1:15:24] call all these little Loose Ends what
[1:15:27] did a prophet do a prophet came in our
[1:15:29] age to teach us that the Loose Ends
[1:15:31] matter and tie them up now I've given
[1:15:33] you that example before but if you look
[1:15:34] at loose ends that that it's a
[1:15:36] colloquial expression what does it mean
[1:15:37] it means that you tied the knots on the
[1:15:40] ship right when before a sailor could
[1:15:42] leave the ship he had to tie up the
[1:15:44] Loose Ends because otherwise the captain
[1:15:46] walks back on the ship and gets hit in
[1:15:48] the face by a
[1:15:49] rope right you get down you get down in
[1:15:51] the or you get in a storm you got to tie
[1:15:52] up the Lo ends before you go through the
[1:15:54] storm oh God if we can just realize we
[1:15:57] need to this is the hour we need to tie
[1:15:59] everything down everything that can be
[1:16:01] shaken will be shaken we're going
[1:16:04] through a storm and so the these were
[1:16:06] loosed in the ecclesiastical realm to
[1:16:08] say all those little Loose Ends those
[1:16:11] little things you don't think is
[1:16:13] important in the message of the hour oh
[1:16:16] well doesn't make any difference anyhow
[1:16:20] I'm not talking about opinions about the
[1:16:21] message I'm about the message
[1:16:24] itself we've added lots of opinions we
[1:16:27] become Pharisees with that right but
[1:16:30] we're talking about the message itself
[1:16:32] doesn't make any we're talking about the
[1:16:33] scriptures we're talking about things
[1:16:34] that
[1:16:35] matter because the message goes back to
[1:16:37] the Bible now look doesn't make any
[1:16:40] difference it's all right he said surely
[1:16:41] God is a good god he loves us all he
[1:16:43] said he
[1:16:45] doesn't that's hard to swallow yeah but
[1:16:49] see they rejected his love they rejected
[1:16:51] his mercy and they stand in the valley
[1:16:54] of decision God's deciding what to do
[1:16:56] with
[1:16:57] them oh
[1:16:59] god oh
[1:17:01] look he said he loves us all he don't
[1:17:03] you hear so much about being a good god
[1:17:05] he's a good God but being good he has to
[1:17:06] be just there's no goodness without
[1:17:07] Justice there's no justice without no
[1:17:09] law without punishment penalty so we're
[1:17:11] in that hour that we're living that's
[1:17:15] where we were in 1964 and that's where
[1:17:17] we're at today that he's been loose to
[1:17:20] call all these little loose ends that
[1:17:21] they don't mean nothing oh it's time to
[1:17:24] tighten up church we don't we don't live
[1:17:26] uh lacad isical about these things we
[1:17:28] don't live haphazardly we don't we don't
[1:17:30] just say well I'll go to church and and
[1:17:32] the grace of God will cover me no now's
[1:17:34] the hour to button up now's the hour to
[1:17:36] tie down the hatches now's the hour to
[1:17:38] raise our families right now is the hour
[1:17:40] to kick out the things that are wrong
[1:17:42] and do what's right in our homes
[1:17:45] again this is the
[1:17:47] time you say well well you know I I got
[1:17:52] some things things I know you know
[1:17:54] bothers me but but I'm a Christian I'm
[1:17:56] saved yes you are I believe that I'm not
[1:17:58] taking that away from you but if it
[1:17:59] bothers you why don't you just get rid
[1:18:01] of it it won't bother you no
[1:18:05] more if you feel conviction but you have
[1:18:08] a question about it don't do it so if
[1:18:10] you have to hide it from everybody and
[1:18:12] you know right just let Let It Go you
[1:18:16] won't have to worry about it no more you
[1:18:18] can come to a place like the old song
[1:18:20] says do you know how it
[1:18:21] feels lay your head on the pillow at
[1:18:24] night and know that your sins have been
[1:18:26] forgiven know that you believe the
[1:18:27] message of the hour listen you won't
[1:18:29] walk you won't do everything right
[1:18:30] that's what Grace is for you won't
[1:18:32] that's what the blood is for you'll make
[1:18:34] mistakes but you don't do it
[1:18:36] deliberately you don't go down and sit
[1:18:37] at the bar and sit there and say well
[1:18:39] God I'm waiting on you to keep me from
[1:18:42] drinking get out of the
[1:18:46] bar are you with me now you sit at home
[1:18:49] and and and every Wednesday night you
[1:18:51] sit down you you you you get to ready to
[1:18:53] go to church you well you know uh
[1:18:55] there's a good show on tonight well
[1:18:57] we'll just stay home and watch at this
[1:18:58] time and we'll be all right we're we're
[1:18:59] elected yeah you're you're elected
[1:19:01] you're you're children of God but if you
[1:19:03] keep doing that it's going to make a
[1:19:04] difference in your family and it won't
[1:19:06] be a good difference it'll be a wrong
[1:19:08] difference it's time to we're we're
[1:19:10] living in too late of an hour to do the
[1:19:12] it's time to step up it's time to stand
[1:19:14] there and take the right
[1:19:19] Road I mean to yell at you
[1:19:23] but the scriptures we waiting on a
[1:19:25] physical squeeze say well there'll come
[1:19:26] a time they'll close the church doors
[1:19:27] now look we're getting into uh Christ as
[1:19:30] a mystery we did that years ago at
[1:19:31] brother iy and it meant so much to me
[1:19:33] personally I'm doing it here Christ is
[1:19:36] the mystery of God revealed on Wednesday
[1:19:38] nights and with the Brandon in there
[1:19:39] he'll tell you about locking the church
[1:19:41] doors an article that he read but then
[1:19:43] at the end he said before they can close
[1:19:44] us up we go
[1:19:46] up so I'm not prepping to be closed
[1:19:50] up I'm prepping to get out of here
[1:19:53] that's why I know Co was
[1:19:55] not the tribulation period cuz I'm still
[1:20:00] here right and maybe there was some
[1:20:03] things there that we can see how they
[1:20:05] would do it but but that's that wasn't a
[1:20:07] tribulation period it's going to be so
[1:20:09] much worse than
[1:20:11] that I tell you what you saw how much
[1:20:13] power the government had then
[1:20:16] amen scared some
[1:20:18] people look there's no said there's no
[1:20:23] without law now look it may happen in
[1:20:25] isolation you say well you know we're
[1:20:28] waiting on a physical squeeze to come
[1:20:29] well in Nigeria and Chad and where uh
[1:20:33] Brother Wilson's in Africa I think right
[1:20:34] now and in some part of Africa and some
[1:20:36] of those countries he goes to that they
[1:20:39] uh you know they have a a physical
[1:20:42] squeeze it does happen we're not the
[1:20:45] only ones that believe the message in
[1:20:46] America right it does happen but but
[1:20:49] brother B taught us that America would
[1:20:51] be would it's it's the fullness of Lea
[1:20:54] it's without it's rich and increased in
[1:20:57] Goods I even noticed in Africa when I
[1:20:59] went back this time to Togo it's so
[1:21:01] backwards like it's it's beyond
[1:21:02] backwards but when I went this time I
[1:21:04] noticed there's more cars more
[1:21:07] affluence and they're Fallen when I
[1:21:09] first went there I noticed that they'
[1:21:11] had gone through Co and everything and
[1:21:13] where they used to be on fire and it was
[1:21:15] real
[1:21:16] quiet you say well that doesn't matter
[1:21:19] it does
[1:21:20] matter and it's not because the noise
[1:21:22] itself doesn't mean anything mean noise
[1:21:23] at a ball game it's not the noise it's
[1:21:26] whether or not people are on fire for
[1:21:27] God you can be on fire for god without
[1:21:29] making a lot of noise but most of
[1:21:32] you will make a little bit of noise at
[1:21:34] least right you get hit with a hammer
[1:21:37] see if you make
[1:21:39] noise right you get sick get a real good
[1:21:41] real bad cold see if some of us guys
[1:21:43] will make noise we'll make
[1:21:45] noise oh honey I'm
[1:21:49] dying get the man flu one time see if
[1:21:51] you make noise
[1:21:53] absolutely you make noise but sometimes
[1:21:56] in
[1:21:57] church we we just need to get stirred up
[1:21:59] but I watch those people they they they
[1:22:01] just weren't like they used to be and
[1:22:02] then as we had church as they went into
[1:22:04] the house of the Lord they begin to feel
[1:22:06] better and by the time I left it was
[1:22:07] just like it always was but when I first
[1:22:09] went there because usually you don't
[1:22:10] have to preach Africans into uh into
[1:22:12] anything they're already there they come
[1:22:14] church that way you almost had to tone
[1:22:17] it down but but they weren't there when
[1:22:19] I first went back this last time and it
[1:22:21] it really struck my heart Leo deia is
[1:22:23] even even across the seas it's getting
[1:22:26] two people as they get better jobs and
[1:22:28] better things and there's nothing
[1:22:29] against that I want you to have good
[1:22:30] jobs trust me I want you to have good
[1:22:33] jobs but as you have better jobs and as
[1:22:36] you have more money don't forget what
[1:22:38] got you there don't forget to be don't
[1:22:41] be like the pig sitting under the apple
[1:22:42] tree that never looks up to see God has
[1:22:44] blessed you there must be a
[1:22:47] reason don't forget
[1:22:51] God
[1:22:53] now majority of this age will be rich
[1:22:55] and increased in Goods I know you're
[1:22:57] sitting there thinking I wish that
[1:22:58] happened to
[1:23:01] me but if you'd recognize I I heard a
[1:23:04] historian the other day they said the
[1:23:06] the poorest person in the world today
[1:23:09] lives better than Kings did in the 16th
[1:23:13] century that'll that'll bring you a
[1:23:14] little
[1:23:16] perspective I I heard someone say that
[1:23:18] John Rockefeller lived in the 30s your
[1:23:21] middle class average American he was the
[1:23:22] richest man that's ever lived I think he
[1:23:24] today his worth would be hundreds of
[1:23:26] billions of dollars that man if he lived
[1:23:29] today he would it lived the lifestyle he
[1:23:31] did then with all that money every one
[1:23:34] of you lived better than he
[1:23:36] did you may not believe it's the truth
[1:23:39] and I know it's getting harder and
[1:23:40] inflation's coming on and things are
[1:23:42] happening oh church if you could just
[1:23:44] see as a pastor I understand the worst
[1:23:48] challenge the the church has is not
[1:23:51] poverty the wor worst challenge is
[1:23:53] saying I'm rich and increased in Goods
[1:23:56] not recognizing what what what hour that
[1:23:59] you're in because the world stands in a
[1:24:01] siery place listen brother BR said
[1:24:03] National Force put Israel in her
[1:24:05] Homeland National Force will put the
[1:24:07] church in the world Council churches but
[1:24:09] the power of God will put the people in
[1:24:11] The Bride you believe that today he said
[1:24:13] the world forces this way and the world
[1:24:15] forces that way but God forces upward
[1:24:18] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:24:20] God my word is spirit and life will put
[1:24:22] the in her place it won't be me it won't
[1:24:24] be you it'll be the spirit of God who
[1:24:26] put the bride in her
[1:24:28] place amen cuz she'll recognize her
[1:24:31] position in the word then she's in
[1:24:32] Christ will put her in her place when
[1:24:34] she realizes who she is and that's what
[1:24:36] the message does it shows you who he is
[1:24:39] and that shows you who you
[1:24:41] are she'll recognize her position in the
[1:24:43] word then she's in Christ we'll put her
[1:24:45] in her place no National Force will do
[1:24:46] it but the National Force did Drive
[1:24:48] Israel to the Homeland the national
[1:24:50] forces of the Council of churches will
[1:24:52] drive every organization into it but the
[1:24:54] power of God will raise the church into
[1:24:55] Glory out of it do you believe that this
[1:24:57] morning aren't you glad for that and yet
[1:25:01] multitudes today stand in the valley of
[1:25:02] judgment waiting on the tribulation
[1:25:05] period Revelation 19 17 he said I saw an
[1:25:09] angel standing in the Sun and he cried
[1:25:11] with a loud voice saying to all the
[1:25:12] fouls that fly in the midst of Heaven
[1:25:15] Come and gather yourself together into
[1:25:16] the supper of the great God that you may
[1:25:19] eat of the Flesh of Kings and the Flesh
[1:25:20] of captains the Flesh of Mighty Men the
[1:25:22] Flesh of horses them that set on them
[1:25:24] the Flesh of all men both free and bond
[1:25:26] both small and great and the Beast was
[1:25:28] taken with him the false prophet verse
[1:25:30] 20 that wrought Miracles before him with
[1:25:31] which he deceived them they received the
[1:25:33] mark of the beast and them that
[1:25:34] worshiped His Image and these both were
[1:25:36] cast alive into a lake of fire burning
[1:25:38] with
[1:25:39] Brimstone the day of the Lord is at hand
[1:25:43] I say make your decision
[1:25:45] now we're right here look at Revelation
[1:25:48] chapter 6 that's the Sixth Seal the
[1:25:52] tribulation
[1:25:54] seal that I beheld when he'd opened the
[1:25:56] Sixth Seal Lo there was a great
[1:25:57] earthquake the sun became black as
[1:25:59] tackle of hair do you see a pattern here
[1:26:01] the sun being dark here in about a month
[1:26:03] we're going to have an eclipse it's
[1:26:04] going to go completely dark here where
[1:26:06] we live hundreds of people thousands of
[1:26:08] people they told me West Plains is
[1:26:09] expecting 300,000 people there's no
[1:26:12] way 300,000 people going to fit in West
[1:26:14] Plains but but they're expecting people
[1:26:17] to come unless it rains you talk about
[1:26:19] dashed
[1:26:20] expectations but they expecting all
[1:26:22] these people to come was what for to
[1:26:25] watch the oh God to watch the sun become
[1:26:31] black but even in an eclipse there's a
[1:26:33] little bit of sun it's behind there
[1:26:35] somewhere and it only lasts for a moment
[1:26:38] but during this time it blacks out
[1:26:42] completely
[1:26:44] completely Moon becomes his blood the
[1:26:47] stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even
[1:26:49] as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs
[1:26:51] when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind the
[1:26:53] heaven departed as a stroll and strolled
[1:26:55] together and every mountain and Island
[1:26:57] were moved out of their places and the
[1:26:58] kings of the earth and the great men and
[1:27:00] the rich men and the child the chief
[1:27:02] captains and the Mighty Men And every
[1:27:03] Bond man man and every free man hid
[1:27:05] themselves in the dens in the rocks of
[1:27:07] the mountains and said to the mountains
[1:27:08] and rocks fall on us there come a
[1:27:12] suicidal Spirit on the
[1:27:16] age you realize we're I told you you're
[1:27:19] the most affluent society that's ever
[1:27:20] been and also the most suicidal
[1:27:24] amen think about it for a minute oh
[1:27:27] church we don't want that we don't want
[1:27:28] that to get on us we don't want that to
[1:27:30] get on us make the right decision walk
[1:27:34] with
[1:27:36] God there was an hour to walk with God
[1:27:39] today the hour to walk with God they
[1:27:42] said to the mountains and the Rocks fall
[1:27:43] on us and hide us from the face of him
[1:27:45] that sth on the throne from the Wrath of
[1:27:47] the Lamb the great day of his wrath has
[1:27:49] come who shall be able to stand yet
[1:27:52] people sit and squabble with one another
[1:27:54] over Petty
[1:27:56] things the day of the Lord is at hand
[1:28:00] make yourself ready you don't want to
[1:28:01] believe like I believe you want to do
[1:28:02] something a little bit different in your
[1:28:03] church go ahead the day of the Lord is
[1:28:05] at
[1:28:06] hand we just got to follow the word as
[1:28:09] closely as we can follow it make things

[1:28:16] brother the brandom tells us said just
[1:28:17] watch stay close to Christ let me warn
[1:28:20] you now as a minister of the Gospel of
[1:28:21] this
[1:28:22] don't take any foolishness don't imagine
[1:28:25] anything stay right there until this
[1:28:27] inside of the inside is anchored to the
[1:28:30] word that you're R in Christ because
[1:28:32] that's the only thing he said because
[1:28:33] we're in the most deceiving age we ever
[1:28:35] lived in it would deceive the very
[1:28:36] elected if it was possible I'm glad it's
[1:28:39] not possible he said because they have
[1:28:42] anointing they can do anything like the
[1:28:43] rest of them he said clean your lives
[1:28:46] up pay your
[1:28:48] debts oh no man Jesus said now he said I
[1:28:51] mean not like your house rent and stuff
[1:28:53] he said he said you got to do it he said
[1:28:55] get all your things off your hands now
[1:28:58] what's he saying there you pay your
[1:28:59] debts don't owe anybody anything if you
[1:29:01] owe somebody an apology make it
[1:29:04] right sit there with condemnation in
[1:29:06] your heart because you swindled somebody
[1:29:08] out of something or pulled a shady
[1:29:10] business deal make it
[1:29:12] right clean up your lives I've seen so
[1:29:15] many people I've never seen and can I
[1:29:17] just preach for a minute I've never seen
[1:29:19] a place as you know whatever I around
[1:29:22] and I've been around this area for many
[1:29:23] many years I'm not criticizing you I
[1:29:25] believe you're real Christians but I
[1:29:26] watched some of the elders in the area
[1:29:28] and they were they were they were men
[1:29:30] who claim to believe this message and
[1:29:31] have Ministries and gifts and boy they
[1:29:33] if you if you cross them way they
[1:29:35] believe one little bit boy they'd fight
[1:29:36] with you but they couldn't pay their
[1:29:39] debts what I mean by that is not that
[1:29:41] they were poor and had got foreclosed on
[1:29:43] I mean they wouldn't do what was right
[1:29:46] they'd Swindle people in business deals
[1:29:48] take advantage of
[1:29:50] people come on come on church that's not
[1:29:52] what a prophet taught us get everything
[1:29:55] right pay your debts make
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:59] ready how you sit there with something
[1:30:01] in your heart against somebody and try
[1:30:02] to preach the gospel you realize what a
[1:30:05] dangerous thing that is you can't do
[1:30:07] that let it go it's too late of an hour
[1:30:11] pay your debts owe no man anything not
[1:30:13] even an
[1:30:16] apology get all your things off your
[1:30:18] hands get everything right Make Ready
[1:30:20] Get Ready remember in the the name of
[1:30:22] the Lord something is fixing to
[1:30:25] happen
[1:30:27] look the valley of decision could be a
[1:30:29] good place if you make the right
[1:30:33] decision BR says everybody wants a
[1:30:35] Hilltop experience they never want to
[1:30:36] take the valley said everybody the
[1:30:38] Pentecostal Church too every night if
[1:30:39] you're not shouting dancing jumping up
[1:30:41] and down speaking in tongues running
[1:30:42] around over the floor or something other
[1:30:44] you didn't have any kind of a meeting
[1:30:46] you said well you know it's all right to
[1:30:47] be on the mountain top that's good right
[1:30:49] if you're never on the mountain top you
[1:30:51] never get to experience the joy of the
[1:30:53] Lord right that's the truth that's just
[1:30:56] the truth but you can't stay up there
[1:30:59] God didn't design you to stay up there
[1:31:02] because when the cold spell comes your
[1:31:04] fruits will freeze up there at night and
[1:31:06] you lose all your fruit so that's what's
[1:31:08] happened now we put too much on
[1:31:09] mountaintop experiences dancing and
[1:31:11] shaking and jumping around instead of
[1:31:13] all night prayer
[1:31:14] meetings look I was so proud of our kids
[1:31:17] this weekend I I'll say this I won don't
[1:31:18] want to embarrass them when they're here
[1:31:20] maybe we'll get some testimonies I was
[1:31:22] so proud of them you you wouldn't have
[1:31:24] even known
[1:31:25] them I was so proud of them because they
[1:31:29] they stayed together as a group and they
[1:31:31] treated one another right and everything
[1:31:34] I could see that they treated one
[1:31:35] another right and everything was was
[1:31:36] going good and y'all may have heard the
[1:31:38] horror stories of the bunks and all that
[1:31:41] but you know Camp is a hard place
[1:31:43] sometimes we need to be a little hard on
[1:31:44] the
[1:31:45] flesh but they treated one another right
[1:31:48] but we had those Mountaintop experiences
[1:31:51] people shouting
[1:31:52] dancing enjoying the presence of the
[1:31:54] Lord but we also had that Valley
[1:31:57] experience and we got to have that in
[1:31:59] church I seen them kids get get down on
[1:32:02] their knees and on their faces spending
[1:32:05] some time with the Lord making sure they
[1:32:07] knew what they believed and what they
[1:32:09] stood for I think there ought to be more
[1:32:11] of that in the house of God not just
[1:32:13] Mountaintop experiences we love that we
[1:32:15] need some of them Valley experiences and
[1:32:17] the valley of decision where you have to
[1:32:19] come down there and meet God and really
[1:32:20] pour out your life until something takes
[1:32:23] place said we've grow fruits up there
[1:32:25] but the freeze kills it every time it
[1:32:27] comes a little cool spell you got
[1:32:28] nothing to rest upon he said when the
[1:32:29] emotion dies down the Shadows all gone
[1:32:31] the noise ceases he said where you at
[1:32:33] the Temptation comes along you can't
[1:32:34] take it what we need is to get down to
[1:32:36] that grinding place down there in the
[1:32:38] valley dig out that's exactly right it's
[1:32:40] where the church needs to be he's
[1:32:41] talking about when they went and dug the
[1:32:43] valley full of ditches because the
[1:32:44] rain's coming that's the way we ought to
[1:32:46] do that's the way every every one of our
[1:32:48] church services ought to be a digging
[1:32:50] time get ready because the spirit of
[1:32:52] God's coming you won't see wind you
[1:32:54] won't see a cloud but the rain's
[1:32:56] coming there's water coming the presence
[1:32:59] of God's going to be
[1:33:01] there that's where the church needs to
[1:33:03] be
[1:33:04] tonight Ruth and orpa want to get to
[1:33:08] this before I close they we're in the
[1:33:10] valley of
[1:33:11] decision now I want you to understand
[1:33:15] that if you were going to go from Moab
[1:33:17] to
[1:33:18] Israel you had to pass through the
[1:33:20] valley
[1:33:22] now think about this with me for just a
[1:33:25] moment just like we got to go through
[1:33:27] leoa to get to the Rapture we're not of
[1:33:30] leoa We're the bride this is the bride
[1:33:33] time the bride age but we passed through
[1:33:37] leoa right and so I don't know how well
[1:33:39] you can see that but that's a map I
[1:33:42] can't hardly see it without my glasses
[1:33:43] but it's a map of Ruth's
[1:33:47] journey and what she did is she was a
[1:33:50] moabitas
[1:33:52] right she had no claims on God she was a
[1:33:55] gentile that's
[1:33:57] us right no claims on God but she had
[1:34:01] married a Jewish boy who was
[1:34:03] backslid because one that a you know God
[1:34:07] and and sometimes God God he's in
[1:34:09] control of Our Lives we just got to
[1:34:11] trust him sometimes we make wrong
[1:34:12] decisions but he still we got to trust
[1:34:14] him he knows what's
[1:34:15] best right but but but she shouldn't
[1:34:18] have you know he shouldn't have ever
[1:34:19] married her right they should have never
[1:34:22] went down there but they did and God
[1:34:24] used it I'm so glad God takes the broken
[1:34:30] places he takes the scars as I preached
[1:34:32] here not long ago and pours gold into
[1:34:34] them and it becomes the place the scars
[1:34:37] become the value of of the of the dish
[1:34:41] the scars become the valuable part
[1:34:44] because we've
[1:34:45] overcome and but she come up out of Moab
[1:34:48] and Moab is a land doesn't believe in
[1:34:50] God don't believe in anything but it's
[1:34:51] in the valley and if you if you looked
[1:34:54] at a topographical map of of of the land
[1:34:57] of Palestine of Israel there's a there's
[1:34:59] a great valley on the other side of the
[1:35:01] river Jordan in the Dead Sea and that
[1:35:04] Valley is where the the mobites are down
[1:35:05] to the South and over to the right now
[1:35:07] some of that was given to the children
[1:35:08] of Israel but up on top you see it's
[1:35:10] called The Plains of
[1:35:13] Moab and so they Journey the Bible tells
[1:35:16] us that even lot you know when when
[1:35:19] Abraham gave him his choice he's he's
[1:35:20] standing there at the middle and he's
[1:35:22] looking down he said in the plane the
[1:35:24] Bible calls it the well-watered plane
[1:35:27] it's not today God judged it but it was
[1:35:30] the well-watered plane and he looked
[1:35:32] down there and he saw that and he he
[1:35:34] recognized that that was that's the way
[1:35:36] he wanted to go because he was thinking
[1:35:38] with a carnal mind Abraham gave him his
[1:35:40] choice but Abraham went up to the
[1:35:42] mountain amen and there he met God and
[1:35:45] God changed his his body back amen amen
[1:35:49] I don't have time to go into all that
[1:35:51] but look
[1:35:52] that's where lot went it's down in the
[1:35:54] valley it's where Israel went after
[1:35:56] refusing to go in at Kadesh barnea
[1:35:58] Kadesh barnea is down at the bottom when
[1:36:00] they didn't go in kades Baria they went
[1:36:01] up the wrong side of the Dead Sea and
[1:36:03] they go up towards the River Jordan but
[1:36:05] they stayed in the plains of
[1:36:06] Moab they could they didn't go over they
[1:36:09] didn't cross on over into the
[1:36:11] land oh
[1:36:13] my oh Church you could just see it they
[1:36:17] didn't stay in they didn't stay in the
[1:36:18] land and so in Deuteronomy 348 it says
[1:36:20] the children of Israel wept for Moses in
[1:36:22] the plains of Moab that's where a lot of
[1:36:25] people still are in the plains of Moab
[1:36:27] but God didn't leave us without without
[1:36:29] the Holy Ghost brother Brandon being a
[1:36:31] type of both Moses and Joshua this
[1:36:33] message didn't only leave us out didn't
[1:36:34] only lead us out it brought us
[1:36:37] in amen but you got to go into it you
[1:36:41] got to follow it in and so so we find
[1:36:45] that Naomi and Ruth and Naomi's
[1:36:48] sister-in-law orpa were on their way Way
[1:36:51] to Bethlehem and there was a last exit
[1:36:55] to the plains of Moab kind of like
[1:36:56] driving if you drive to Oklahoma you get
[1:36:58] to Joplin it's his last free
[1:37:03] exit if you leave any later place going
[1:37:06] to cost
[1:37:07] you oh my last pre-exit so here the
[1:37:12] roads
[1:37:13] diverged here was the
[1:37:15] crossroads and they could go one way and
[1:37:17] I could see it in my mind as they they
[1:37:19] come to this place and to the left is
[1:37:21] the
[1:37:21] mountains to the right is the plain of
[1:37:25] Moab we can either stay in familiar
[1:37:28] territory or go up into into Heavenly
[1:37:32] places right so they're here in the
[1:37:34] plane of Moab and they're sitting there
[1:37:36] and they're just what what do we do and
[1:37:39] so the Bible tells us in R 1:7 speaking
[1:37:41] of Naomi Naomi is a type of the word
[1:37:44] said wherefore she went forth out of the
[1:37:46] place where she was also a type of the
[1:37:47] Jewish Church went forth out of the
[1:37:49] place where she was her two daughters
[1:37:51] and in law with her and they went on the
[1:37:52] way to return unto the land of Judah
[1:37:55] they went on their way and they made it
[1:37:57] through justification and
[1:37:59] sanctification they made it to a place
[1:38:01] where to go any
[1:38:04] further they would be
[1:38:06] in see Judas made it to that
[1:38:09] place one more
[1:38:12] step one more
[1:38:14] step but he was still just a step away
[1:38:16] from The Plains of Moab that's right
[1:38:19] right that's where so many people live
[1:38:21] live they come to church they're one
[1:38:24] step
[1:38:25] away oh
[1:38:28] God they've left what they used to
[1:38:31] do they've let some things get cleaned
[1:38:33] up in their life they well things are
[1:38:35] pretty good but but you've One Step from
[1:38:37] doing what you did
[1:38:39] again and being who you were you got to
[1:38:42] cross over into the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:44] Ghost because if you don't do it you're
[1:38:46] going to be like that man that was
[1:38:47] delivered that that of of of a devil but
[1:38:50] he swept the house and garnish it but
[1:38:52] then seven other Devils come and live
[1:38:54] there that devil come back and seven
[1:38:56] more with him what was it he didn't have
[1:38:58] no Goodman of the house there was nobody
[1:39:00] there listen the King has to take up
[1:39:02] residence on the
[1:39:04] inside you stand there and you come to
[1:39:06] church and I appreciate that I listen
[1:39:08] you say well I failed this week come
[1:39:10] back to the house of
[1:39:11] God I messed up come back keep coming
[1:39:14] back don't quit don't quit you're still
[1:39:16] in the valley of decision don't go the
[1:39:18] wrong way don't go down to the in the
[1:39:21] moam just go back to what you were stay
[1:39:23] there but you can't stay there
[1:39:25] forever understand you got to go this
[1:39:27] way you got to go up in the
[1:39:29] mountain I hope I'm not boring you this
[1:39:32] morning listen she went forth out of the
[1:39:35] place where she was and her daughters
[1:39:36] inlaw with her they went on the way to
[1:39:38] return to the land of Judah and Naomi
[1:39:39] said unto her two daughter-in-law go
[1:39:41] return each to her mother's house they
[1:39:43] come in conflict with the word where it
[1:39:45] would be easier to just go to the plane
[1:39:48] of Moab because the word told them look
[1:39:52] Naomi told them go return each to your
[1:39:53] mother's house the Lord deal kindly with
[1:39:55] you as you have dealt with the dead and
[1:39:56] with me go and just be regular people go
[1:39:59] and just live like
[1:40:01] leoda they must have stood there at the
[1:40:03] edge of the valley One Step from the
[1:40:06] Hill Country where all the promises
[1:40:11] lay they both wanted to stay with her
[1:40:14] Bible tells us that they said unto her
[1:40:16] surely we will return with thee un thy
[1:40:18] people and she said I can't have any
[1:40:20] more children all I can promises
[1:40:21] hardship the valley of Moab is waiting
[1:40:24] nothing bad ever happens there you can
[1:40:26] go down there and and live like you
[1:40:28] always lived oh but I'm so glad that I
[1:40:30] made that decision with the bill to walk
[1:40:32] up the mountain I'm so glad I didn't
[1:40:35] stay in the valley of decision but I
[1:40:37] went
[1:40:39] forward and they lifted up their voice
[1:40:41] they lifted up their voice and wept
[1:40:43] again and orpa kissed her
[1:40:47] mother-in-law oh God Judas kissed Jesus
[1:40:51] he tried to what was it they lived just
[1:40:53] good enough to satisfy their
[1:40:59] conscience oh we can't live there church
[1:41:01] you'll betray him you'll betray him when
[1:41:04] the when push comes to shove it's going
[1:41:05] to get hard there's going to be tough
[1:41:07] times you'll turn him down but you got
[1:41:09] to go on even Peter betrayed him but he
[1:41:11] had to go on because he was a seat of
[1:41:13] God God there was forgiveness for him
[1:41:16] there was a place of repentance and he
[1:41:17] went down and got the Holy Ghost and he
[1:41:19] never denied him again
[1:41:22] he went up in the
[1:41:23] mountain but Judas went down in the
[1:41:25] valley and hung
[1:41:27] himself that you can go down there you
[1:41:30] can have a life without the word dress
[1:41:31] any way you want to live any way you
[1:41:32] want to not feel
[1:41:34] condemnation but I'm here to tell you
[1:41:37] that if you get it right what I mean by
[1:41:40] that is you get the true baptism of the
[1:41:41] Holy Ghost there's no condemnation up
[1:41:44] here
[1:41:45] either the condemnation is because
[1:41:47] you're down here in the valley of
[1:41:49] decision
[1:41:51] that's what that's why you that's why
[1:41:53] you have a hard time worshiping you just
[1:41:55] remain down in that Valley but if you
[1:41:56] could ever get up on a
[1:41:58] mountain the message would mean
[1:42:00] something to you then because it it's
[1:42:01] what brought you there look Ruth clav to
[1:42:05] the word and she said behold thy
[1:42:07] sister-in-law has gone back into her
[1:42:08] people under her Gods return Thou after
[1:42:11] thy sister-in-law and Ruth said entreat
[1:42:13] me not to leave thee or to return from
[1:42:15] following after thee whether thou goest

[1:46:04] if the Bible said I must receive the
[1:46:05] holy ghost that I'll do if the Bible
[1:46:07] tells me Jesus Christ is the same
[1:46:09] yesterday today and forever that I'll
[1:46:11] believe I'll take the Bible in God for
[1:46:14] what he's wrote and what he is no matter
