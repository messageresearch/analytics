time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance time to Cast Away stones and time together Stones together to invert time to embrace and time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose and a time to keep and a time to Cast Away time to Rend and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak time to love and the time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace what prophet he that worketh in that we're in he labereth have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time can you say praise the Lord God bless you you can have your seats this evening well I could take for a few moments something that we've been preaching on here for the last several months on God makes everything beautiful in his time and and I like the minister maybe on walk on just for a little while tonight and and uh here's brother Stewart done an outstanding job this morning and God's good brother it's a good man good preacher and and uh I cherish his friendship but he says here God will make everything beautiful in his time second Corinthians tells us before we walk by faith and not by sight and we realize that brother Brown tells that the new Christian or new uh New Testament Christianity is based on a church that is an action and we believe that that uh that uh that there is a time and a season for all things and and just because we're going through the mountains or the Bluffs or the hard times or bad times or low times amen we believe that God's got it all in control and he it doesn't change who you are doesn't change your identity and amen but God wants a church that is inaction and not just a lip service and you know not just saying amen from the lips but actually living that life of Jesus Christ in a dying generation they've been this world so wicked has fallen apart but he said in the evening in time there shall be light and and I believe we're looking at some light here of this evening amen but God even saying the gospels he would tell he said when the lepers came unto him and and was you know asking for prayer and asked him for healing and he said you know go make yourself known unto the priest and the scripture says as they went amen they began to receive their healing amen so we realize that God wants us to act upon God's word amen not just a lip service but actually punctuating the word with an a man not from the list but the life that we live do you believe that now Hebrews chapter 12 says and the second verse says looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith and we realize that brother Brown told us you know just keep steady just keep walking on and watch the end and just keep steady just keep moving on and Paul would tell us being confident in this that he that begun a good work in you was going to perform it he's going to bring it to an end and another word there just means oversight God's got it we either believe God's got it all in control tonight or we don't but I believe tonight that God's got everything under control amen nothing catches God off guard amen we serve a powerful God that knows every time a flea bats his eyes every every grain of sand that's on the seashore amen God knows everything about our lives God knows every problem that's in the church God knows every situation in our homes amen and God believe tonight amen God's got it all in control hey Benny you know we don't as our finite Minds we don't understand why and how and and why isn't it happening right now hey Ben but if we believe that God is a good shepherd hey Ben how many believes he's a good shepherd ain't been though nothing happens without him knowing about it amen and I say he's got our intent good intentions it is mine it says faith is the victory that overcomes the world now he says I'm going to read these really fast but these are some things brother Brown says on faith faith knows no circumstance Faith knows no defeat Faith knows no reasoning Faith knows no difficult Faith knows no fear Faith knows where he's at Faith acts Faith holds on it can't move Faith knows no shock Faith knows no it's done Faith knows no hindrance Faith sees the sun beyond your stormy clouds faith cannot be stopped faith is the key that unlocks the door faith is the victory so hope brother Brown would tell us hope is on the outside hoping it was in but faith is on the inside looking out saying the battle is already over and the victory has been won nothing can stop a believer on his way to meet the promises of God say it would be nothing can stand in the way of a Believer going to meet the promises of God and the scripture says there's no weapon formed against you shall prosper so shall we quit or shall we stop or shall we retreat no doubt that's what David was with entertaining in his mind when he began to ask God shall I pursue and God's answer to David was pursue don't stop don't quit don't give up God's got it all in control for thou shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all say praise the Lord and the prophet would say when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard against it and he says hallelujah he said let's go the winds are blowing and the prophet says set yourselves don't worry about your neighbor this evening set yourselves and right in the face of the storm God will make this trial a blessing you believe it even in your season of hardship even in your season of pain God still got it all in control amen and it's up to you and I this evening if we can be appalling Silas in the midst of season of hardship when they were they were tortured and they was made fun of and they were standalized but right in the midst of a Midnight Hour Paul began to praise His God right in the midst of their hardship silence began to lift his hands up and say I don't know what you've come to do but I come to praise my God they've been in their season of hardship they were still walking with God Romans 8 28 says all things work together for the good to them that love God and who are those that called according to his purpose whether it's sickness brother Brown says whether it's prison whether it's death where it's Sorrows whatever it was they would it would still work out for your good can you say praise the Lord no matter the what season it is walk with God doctor says you're going to die brother Brown says walk with God doctor says you can't walk with God just walk with God he said for God has promised you I like this promise I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by the Covenant that he gave you that he would confirm it and brother Brown says just walk with God he said listen to what he says you'll have your ups and downs come on somebody in other words you're going to have your bad days you're going to have your down days and he says don't worry you got to go through the Briar patches over the sharp rocks over the Bluffs down over the hillsides up through the mountains over the waters but walk with God you're gonna make it Church Hallelujah no weapon formed against you can prosper it cannot stop a believer that is walking by faith for the joy I'll never leave you your family can lead you your family can forsake you churches might leave you friends might forsake you but God says they can but I can't they can leave you but I can't they might but I won't Force by never failing promise I'm going to be with you I'm gonna follow you I'm going everywhere you go I'm going right I'm never going to lose a one of you you've engraved into the palms of my hands amen am I oversight over you this is one thing for sure I'm not going to lose one of you you might be going through a trial but Paul my grace is sufficient in other words it's enough for you to get out of the slump that you're in Hallelujah sign says there's no way the odds are stacked up against me you've lost this and You've Lost That come on we've all been their Church we've been through the Bluffs we've been through some sorrow we've been through some ups and downs and over the Briar patches how many has ever been rapping hunting before hey Ben you you go one time in Flight pants or regular jeans hey man you feel it don't you brother Harvey hey man it's a hard thing to go through some Briar patches in this life amen but it's a good thing that you have a piece that passeth all understanding that is down inside of you and the world didn't give it to you amen the world can't take it away and he said I will never believe me I'll forsake you I'll be with you and look around this morning or this evening we're still here we're still fighting the greatest battles ever fought hey Ben we've been through some hardship brother Bobby we've been through some uh hardships and curves and mountains and desert times but look at your neighbor and say but I'm still here I'm still here even the devil has blown as hard as he can blow but at the end of the day I'm still standing amen and Satan might knock me down hey baby I get back up shake the dust off my pants and I keep on moving forward hallelujah boy I believe he gave me something that's Eternal value it's something ain't here today or gone tomorrow Romans 4 says talking about Abraham being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb and he staggered nod at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded what he had promised he was also able to perform and the prophet said Abraham he never let he didn't let unbelief contaminate him he looked at one thing that was the voice that spoke to him whose report are you going to believe this evening amen if you can believe a lie and be down by it I believe you can believe truth and be set free by it this evening hey Ben so whose report you're going to believe let's look he said brother man would go he said well the first month pass this is how Abraham didn't allow his Spirit to be contaminated Sarah how you feeling not a bit different Sonny well glory to God can we have an Amen on that this evening well Glory gonna have it anyhow God said so the second month passed how about it sweetheart no different Abraham will bless God we're going to have it anyhow that first year passed no difference but he just kept walking with God and praising God Amen no difference going to have the baby in hell he said brother Brown said why God said so 25 years passed he said what about it Sarah no difference darling but God glory to God we're going to have it anyhow God will never give you a promise unless first there is a deposit for it in other words Abraham wasn't worried about how it was going to happen or when it was going to happen brother Brown said he knew the who that made the promise and that the who is God that God never gives you a promise unless there's already the deposit Amen in the bank amen it says it's yours and faith is standing here hopes on the outside hoping I could get it but your faith is within you this evening saying but Joe you got it don't give up don't quit don't stop Hallelujah you're going to make it yes sir Abraham he said put his focus on thus save the Lord and he walked confessing Abraham kept on going and then the Brother Band would take us back to Genesis 22 and then Abraham was going to offer up a hijack he took the wood he laid the wood on Isaac's shoulders and he took the fire in his hand and he looked at this and said he says I love this his Warner he says to the servants you stay here The Aladdin are going under the worship then aladd and I shall return glorious I just had to let that come out how's he going to come back Abraham you're going to have to kill him how's he going to return with you but he took God at his word knowing that God had promised him through Isaac God was going to do something special he didn't know what but it wasn't his business to know what just walk on he said How's God going to heal me I don't know but walk on just keep moving moving on just about the time he got ready to act upon God's commandment the Holy Spirit grabbed his hand and said Abraham Abraham stay your hand there's a ram in the thicket the Lord will provide for himself a sacrifice just when we think it's impossible just when they think you exalted every Avenue of God's grace then God shows up to let you know God's gonna make everything beautiful in his time amen that God's gonna make this trial a blessing how you know that for sure brother Joe amen I know one thing about my God he's never left me he's never left me he's never broke his promise I break my promises nearly daily but God never one time ever broke his promise to me yes I might be late but God's never been late Hallelujah this he said Abraham put his focus on thus saith the Lord and walk straight on Brother David day after day year after year he walked confessing confessing my God's a provider my God's an ever-present help in a time of trouble my God Will Make A Way when it seems to be no way how many serves that kind of God tonight amen my God is going to make a way when it seems to be no way I say he's faithful tonight I say it's faithful tonight he's going to make everything beautiful in his time Hallelujah brother man would say this message is urgent don't stop don't stop don't quit don't give up keep going keep going let's keep moving don't stop don't look to the left or right keep your focus on the goal that is set before us there's I like this and I'm brother Joe listen he says there's nothing going to be able to stop you are you hearing me somebody don't stop don't give up there's not enough demons out of hell that's going to be able to stop this church Hallelujah just when you think brother Joe I've lost this I've lost money I lost this I lost this and I've lost that listen friends God says I got it all in control I got you right where I want you this didn't catch me off guard I've seen your sufferings I've seen your pain but I believe if you believe Romans 8 28 how many believes it this evening he said God's gonna make this trial a blessing just hold on don't quit don't stop brother sir you might say well how in the world he's going to fix this hang on my god's got strange ways my God is going to make a way when it seems to be no way good he allowed the prophet of God to show up at a widow woman's house just at the right moment just when it looked like there was no hope there was no food there was nothing left for her just to eat and die then God sends a man of God down by our house just at that very moment with those Thunder words thus saith the Lord your meal Bearer is not going to run out your whole is not going to run out I say we serve the same God he's the same right now as he was then God's gonna show up and show out you might not feeling but praise God we don't go with our feelings our brother sure you might not have preached this morning I might not be up here tonight if we went by feelings but we go by God's word and God's word says greater is he that is in me than the he that's in the world do you believe it he showed up and showed out at the right moment and a season would it look like it was impossible and the odds was against them amen he showed up in a season and the fiery furnace God shows up and shows out there was a story I tell many times you might have heard me tell it but I'll tell it again there was a widow woman that didn't have no money and she didn't have nothing no husband and she didn't have no job and and she went Brother David praying to her God I need your touch from you how many has been there before Lord I need you to move in my situation I need you to touch my family I need to touch our situation lord I can't even walk without you holding my hand Lord I I'm telling you we might not feel like we're getting a hold of God but God's got an ear to you and he begin to have it the prayers of this widow woman Lord all I'm asking is for you to give me some food to feed my children and the next door neighbor heard about and heard her praying and he went down and took all his money and bought her some groceries and brought it to her to her porch and knocked on the doorbell and walked away and here's she brother Allen came out and my she was so excited she would begin to shout and have herself a little Pentecostal Jubilee and say praise God my God Did It My God Did It My God did it he's an on time God he showed up and showed out and and this guy was you know begin to scream from the bush and say hey your God didn't do it I did it I did it and he was an atheist and he was trying to prove to her that her God wasn't alive and Maya didn't change her praise sister called she began to even she began to praise that much louder praise God he did it he did it he did it no doubt says you know what you're an oddball you're not I went out and spent all of my money to buy this food for you to show you that your God is dead and he's not alive and then she went again shouting and screaming and dancing and hollering and I just had herself a little Jubilee God did it God did it you've lost your mind God did it God did it and he made the devil pay for it God will make this trial of blessing it will only begin to hold on and hold our peace and let the Lord fight our battles I say tonight God's got it all under control you might not feeling moving but it doesn't change the fact that God's Gonna oversight and he's going to bring you to an end even at the cost that devil didn't realize what he was doing yeah he went out and spent everything he had to prove that one of God alive amen but it doesn't stop us from Child tonight Satan has emptied out hell amongst us but that we we don't give up because I just read the day the prophet of God said every time God begins amen hell begins to pour out his but the good thing amen that he gives us an anointing of a flying eagle and this Eagle cannot be caged up this last day Eagle she cannot be caged but denominationalism emotionalism Creeds dogmas it's free who the son has made free is free indeed keep walking keep walking I just kept on walking that's the only thing to do brother Brown says no matter how it looks just keep on anyhow if God said to do it just keep on anyhow that's the way you do it that's the way you get well just keep on walking just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism who cares what people thinks about us walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him all things are possible I say you're an invincible Army if you're walking by faith with God look he says look what these fine doctors said a while ago he comes to this end of the role then trust God there you are the science is all right as long as you're climbing up that tree and when you get as far as up as you can go no father step over on the tree of faith and just keep on walking because it has no end to it all things are possible to them that belief tree of knowledge and science it's got its limitations but the tree of faith is unlimited the tree of science destroys and brings death but the tree of Faith builds up and brings life my brother man would identify science as good but when it's ready scores when he ran out the fires you can go with science like the woman in the in the in the the New Testament that stepped over after 12 long years of Fallen the tree of knowledge and science over on the tree of faith Hallelujah and then Jesus was making a statement like this somebody touched me virtues gone out of my body I say is the same Jesus this evening if we could touch him with that caliber of faith we can stop Jesus in his tracks tonight hey Ben I say if you've been walking on the limbs of Science and you be and you feel like a failure feel like there's no way Escape you feel like there's no way you could ever get over that depression or oppression or sickness I say there's a tree of Faith tonight that you could step on over on it ain't been where all things are possible if only you could believe hallelujah how many believe that then brother Brownwood tells us testimony talking about this daddy he went to pray for this boy he said he went to a hospital and the doctor Batman said I wouldn't bother with him said the boy might die any moment so brother Brown said so I went nailed across the bed and the boy was unconscious and I put my hands upon the boy and prayed just a few words of prayer I said father God I do not understand but this poor old man is crying out and asks me to come here and the only thing I know to do is ask you and I say I pray that you will spare This Boy's Life In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ and the old father turned around oh Father turned around to his mother and put his arms around her neck and they began to hug one another wrapping their tears from their eyes saying isn't it wonderful isn't it wonderful mother and I looked and that little nurse was standing there with her head turned and looking because she just could believe science Mr Robin that's all she could see was what the instrument was saying and she was snickering and making fun and they begin to hug one another and he looked over to mother and said think of it Bob's gonna be well Hallelujah and their boy was still standing there unconscious still looked like there was no hope but the father could turn to his mother and said praise God her son Bob is gonna make it if we can have that kind of Faith tonight Church that no matter what the situation looks like praise God we're gonna make it praise God we're going to overcome praise God this battle is going to be a blessing how do you know brother Joe cause all things work for the good God's gonna make it beautiful in his time and he says Bob is going to be well praise the Lord there it is just like Abraham he would not allow unbelief to contaminate his spirit oh if we can do that tonight if we would not allow the things of the Flesh of things that surrounding us even our spirit to contaminate us cause our flesh can say we're dying our emotion to tell you everybody is against me nobody likes me and our affection is going to sit there you know you know this or that nobody loves me everybody hates me I don't know about you I've been there many times but don't you like that still Small Voice that begins to tell you Joe thank you forsake you but I can't think I can leave you but I can't time when I was ready to quit and give up brother remember tells us hey Ben how would I let go a long time ago but it wasn't me holding him it was him holding me in my darkest times ain't been in my song grief I was ready to give up I was ready to quit I remember something kept holding something kept pulling that same spirit that came looking for me that day when I couldn't I didn't deserve to be saved I didn't go looking for him he came looking for me Hallelujah if we could have that same fate tonight no matter what it looks like on the surface Bob's going to be healed praise God praise God and maybe your your neighbor somebody in a church say you know what nothing's changed is it still the same old boy you're still the same old girl there's no way you're going to ever get over it and but they used to move you but into something's different now you've got an anchor of the soul that is sure and steadfast an acre an absolute that's right for the anchor is holding the ship it's not the ship holding the anchor it's the the anchor holding me keeping me and brother Brown says you know what he said oh job he'd get out there I know this is all free forgive me I'm having a good time up here hey baby job hey babe would get up here and he said you know that old line will get loose a little bit and Joe begin to feel sorry for himself and feel like the whole world's coming in and it was hey baby all of a sudden he said job looked out and he's seen those Resurrection in life and he said brother Brown said all of a sudden that line that's been running loose come on somebody it was always there it was always there he said but as a running loose begin to tighten up to his absolute and he began to scream out I know my redeemer liveth yes Hallelujah yes Bob's going to be well they reach across the boy and shut the hands and said thank you brother Brandon for obeying the Lord to come and pray the prayer of faith for our boy I never said no more than a prayer then the nurse said sir I don't believe you understand he said oh yes I do said you claim you love this boy said certainly we love this boy he said how can you act like that when this boy is dying medical history science knowledge when a certain thing happens they don't never get over it they never get well the instrument goes that low the boy cannot pump back again and said you see the boy can die any moment he's unconscious he's even too weak to know anything and said then he can stand there and laugh then you could stand there and laugh and carry on like that and she didn't know what kind of carrying on that was I say act like that and your son dying and the Old Gentleman he said I'll never forget him he turned and put his hand at his father upon a little lady's shoulder about 18 year old snicker Fritz you know that he said a little handy and said listen honey you know you're looking at the instrument that's all you know about but I'm looking at the promise and the word of God said my boy is going to live and no matter what he looks like here he's going to live for the prayer of faith shall save the sick that's all he was making on is one promise of God but yet God will not give a promise unless he's already deposited the funds to back it up Hallelujah well that's about 15 years ago and that boy is married and got two children he will believe no matter what the instrument says his fate wasn't in the instruments it was in God's promise whose report you're going to believe God gave you a checkbook and he's written his name in the blood of Jesus Christ and in funds is already there but the Harvey all you have to do is fill in when the doctor said you would never get over that kidney disease that you have but you're still here Hallelujah the doctors don't understand Bill Harvey how you even made it this far but you're still here holding on the promise of God I don't understand it but one thing for sure brother Harvey you kept walking on you kept walking on through whatever instruments of the doctor said it reached this end but you you climbed the father's link of that lamb could give you but you had to make a decision am I going to go home and die or I'm gonna go step over on the tree of faith and thank God at his word you can even be a labor lie and be damned by it or believe truth and the truth shall set you free right and that truth will bring Liberty and freedom and peace and brother Harvey you can go back to the doctor and the doctor and say brother Harvey just keep doing what you're doing I don't know what you're doing but just keep doing what you're doing Hallelujah whose report you're going to believe then brother Brown will go talking about a crowd that's around him is this okay yes but here they all come running in running everywhere and looked and I seen a man coming around the corner pressing through the crowd and there was an old man standing there with the club we had walked on it and he had twisted up leg he said I know you brother Brandon he said I've been standing here eight days I've got five little children at home that sounds familiar I've been crippled I said I believe you he said I believe you good you're a good boy if you'll ask God to heal me he can do it I said do you believe that brother he said with all of my heart but David he didn't get over and pray and spit and slobber that's okay too but all he said Do you believe God do you believe he can do it listen what the prophet God says he said he said I believe you're a good boy he said he said Do you believe he can do it with all my heart do you believe that brother he said with all my heart he said then in the name of Jesus Christ give me your Club when he handed him the club just as the lepers Jesus told them go show yourself unto the priest as they went the Lancers see was cleansed brother bear said when he handed him the club his foot that was all twisted up and mingled began to straighten up Hallelujah and he handed him in a club and God honored his faith and his foot come straight like that and he leaked up the air and began to scream to the top of the voice his voice but it came to a place are you going to believe a lion be down by it are you going to believe truth whose report you're going to believe yeah then a brother man would talk about I'm gonna go a few of these in a hurry the lady with arthritis came to the prayer line she had high blood pressure many pains Brothers brother Brown says may your faith reach it now he prays a simple prayer now don't doubt anything now raise your feet up and this lady begins to lift her feet up and down and up and down and move your hand now walk right out down them steps a miracle has been deformed on this lady walk on sister see how it can work the prophet God says see how it can work she was crippled up with arthritis coming through the prayer line but he began to say sister Lift Your Hands Up Lift Your Feet lift them up and she began to lift her feet and put her feet upon the Devil and she began to testify praise God praise God I'm Healed how was she doing maybe not from the lips but she began to live her lift her hands but the doctor said she couldn't and the doctor said you'll never be able to lift your feet like that but hear the presence of God was in Tabernacle around that building this was a predestinated moment of time lift your hands stand to your feet lift your hands stop on the devil there you go there she came up with operators brother Allen but she walked out totally healed you say brother Joel that's for yesterday I beg to differ for you I was preaching the same thing in Georgia last weekend and I came to this place and I began to talk about how she lifted her hands and lifted her feet and there was a lady who her sister sister Henry's Brian Henry's wife and she's been suffering with the arthritis for many years and the testimony of her husband told me the next morning she came up too but she sister Jackie she was suffering for many many months many years I don't know but I know this that she was suffering the last three or four days really bad and brother Brian told me he said I was watching her struggle through the service she couldn't be still she was hurting suffering so bad in church but I came to this place and there was such an atmosphere of faith that was built up in its Tabernacle not because I was preaching and because God began to drop down in that Tabernacle and say I've been like God they healeth all about diseases and I said stand up and that lady in her pain stood to her feet and when she got to her feet Billy Joel that arthritis left her body and Brian said I got to looking at her and her face began to change she was so ecstatic that just few moments ago she couldn't even hardly stand up without somebody helping her and she made her way out right there where brother Mike is and came walking down this road right here and she came up to the prayer line or not the prayer line she just come up testify so I got something to say the Lord touched me standing right there I didn't have hands laid on me but there was a spirit of faith in the Tabernacle and I said if God can do it for her God can do it for me Hallelujah ain't been the next day brother Brian says I got I got those looking at her walking up in the house she had a spring in her step she was moving like she hadn't moved in months I say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's here right now to say if he'd done it for Jessica he can do it for me we had a Tent Revival last year but Joe some of y'all came to it I don't even remember what service it was but the Lord began to drop down in the that little tent and begin a move in a special way and maybe it was brother Wayne preaching and he began to invite people to you know step out by faith step out by faith and there was a sister in that in that under that tent that goes to church with us that's been addicted with prescription drugs for many many years I believe it was 27 years she's been addicted to pain pills she stood to her feet and began to lift her hands and the spirit of the Lord came down and in a special way and changed her she took those pills and she drugged dumped them all out and and since that day it's almost gone on a year she hadn't took one pill and she went back to the doctor or whatever that little little pow-wow they have with with the addicts and began to tell you no you can't just quit those you're gonna have to wait you don't understand I hadn't tucked one in two and a half weeks if God doesn't church he does it right she just stepped over on the limb of Faith she followed signs for so long that she got addicted to it thought she couldn't get over it but my God can do a miracle tonight he done a miracle in me he done a miracle how many he's got the Holy Ghost here tonight God did performed a miracle in you and you're sealed to the day of your Redemption Hallelujah brother around prays for a woman with cancer father Grant healing of our sister this demon called cancer in the name of Jesus Christ and believe it now mother put your old cane on your shoulder and walk on do you believe it my brother around said oh I feel good because I know thus say the Lord just anchor my soul there and walk on Satan just hiss at you all he wants to it doesn't bother me because I know who I have believed I persuaded to believe the report of Truth how can overcome and such such a condition and season is this God is building a boat Hallelujah Noah built a boat 120 years I'm gonna hurry what a paradox that God told him to take a take some gopher wood and taking every Green Tree and beat their eyes and out of it bullet pour it on some gopher wood brother Brown said when they begin to pour it on there and it soaked it inside and held him it's settled settled it sealed it harder than silk I said why didn't they use some oak tree Oak so much doubter so much better but Brothers it doesn't make any difference how styled Oak is God's specks was gulper wood and God's going to do something with that wood Hallelujah do you believe it yes sir and brother man said the word pitch means to stand between it was gulper wood and the art was to keep out and atone The Believer from the Wrath no could not get in the Wrath because of waters of judgment look he cannot come into judgment because there was an atonement between him and the Judgment get a good open-heart person and pour in the pitch which was the Holy Ghost I say the Lord tonight Lord what was he doing to know he was conditioned Noah to rise and as it did it doesn't matter how deep the water was this boat was going to elevate Noah about the judgments it was an atonement between Noah and the and judgment Hallelujah listen what brother Brown says fill me into the believer with the Holy Ghost of fire until they're so full that they're not their self anymore then she can blunt the waves in other words you're not going to be exempt from waves you're going to be able to blunt the waves you're gonna bump up against some logs but you'll knock them out of the way and keep on going you can bump him bounce him kick him do anything you want to him but he's cased over sealed to the day of his Redemption oh my a chosen place God has chosen to place his name will the name of Jesus is there's power with the name of Jesus is there's Authority Hallelujah for the scripture says every knee shall bow hey Ben I say depression with bowel sickness with bowel funny feelings with bowel there are fine people I'm trying to hurry I've got I got a few more things I'd like to get to there's five people in the world find churches but he said but there's one miss Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for that's where his name lays that's his where his worship is in her and her alone where's places his name there's victory how many can say Amen replaces his name there's victory so if there's victory in his name and his name is in her in her alone I say there's victory in the Tabernacle of the Lord know you not that you are a temple of the Holy Spirit and you're cased over harder than steel everybody else says why in the world do you want to take some of these gopher Woods because God knows what he's doing Hallelujah just brother Stuart he came to a woman at the well hello he came to a woman at the well that was married five times in a bad situation he bypassed a lot of good men a lot of good churches a lot of priests yeah but down there at the well that day was a predestinative moment where there was some representation down there God knew exactly what he could get out of that Gulf of wood yes sir Hallelujah that's where his name is and her and her alone oh it changes your worship it changes your worship it changes your citizenship I mean I'm not of this world this world is not my home we sing the song like Rahab she was in Jericho but she wasn't of Jericho God's working when it doesn't even seem like he's working sister Carla he could bring by some spies to a harlot think about it spies came to a harlot's house but God was working it out for our good she didn't even know what was going on brother David but God was working it out for her good God was going to make it beautiful in his time and then she began the very thing that he allowed brother Danny those other the spies to escape he said you buying this let it become a token to you let it become life to you that everything that's behind this token is going to be saved it's good and then when Joshua went out trying to find a way to overcome Jericho the lord of the hosts came down gives Joshua a visitation I say he's still watching over Jericho the lady that was in Jericho God's working it out Hallelujah walk around seven times on Seventh Day walk around seven times listen friends every wall but her house fell oh you hear me somebody L the one when that earthquake began to shake Jericho it was strong enough to take down every house but the one that had the token applied [Applause] those walls she was in captivity Behind the Walls of bondage there was no Jubilee in sight for her behind the walled City but God was going to make a way the very walls that was supposed to hold her in and keep her under captivity was destroyed with all of her accusers hold a preachers say this one time and it just rung a bell in my heart that when it when the dust settled Rahab escaped that destruction fell in love with a general in the army of God they fell in love and they they they were deciding to get married and no doubt on that wedding day that that priest would stand there and begin to do the vows over them and would say is there just one is there anyone here that has anything to say that these two shouldn't be joined together and no doubt they begin to talk back to fourth of one another and right so I heard so and so and the priest would say well the word says go down and find two accusers but God was by making everything beautiful in time we didn't understand why the spies came to Rahab we didn't understand why not when the lord of the hosts showed up we didn't understand why we had received the token and nobody else did but God was working it out that God destroyed all of her accusers and when they ran back to find two they wasn't none there God make everything beautiful in his time first Peter tells us but the God of all Grace who has called us into the eternal glory by Jesus Christ Christ Jesus after that you suffered a while will make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you Hallelujah sister Jackie God came to me and you in all of our flaws in all of our sins and screamed out I can't and I won't lose one of you I'm bigger than them flaws brother Bible says as is tucking him four thousand years to take make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2 000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another masterpiece ain't got my picture with me today but in doing so he does it by his never-changing method the same way he made the masterpiece his word that's the way he's making the Masterpiece because it can only be the perfect Masterpiece when it's a perfect word Hallelujah so God come down that first Eve fell but Christ the mystery Gods he brother says a lion roars and says you know that first seed failed Brother David but this second Eve she's not going to fall she's going to be fortified behind the word dressing his word they'll never break they'll never cease they'll never be defeated can never lose this power oh we're cased over harder than steel there she is she suffered a while went through the fire the Briar patches the sharp rocks persecution rejected and there she stands Victorious clothed and fortified behind the word hallelujah how are we going to make it church because we're fortified behind the word of a king and where the word of a king is there's power and nothing in time can you say Amen nothing in time could ever change what God had in his mind of you before the foundation of the world five husbands didn't change what he had of her before the foundation of the world the picture wasn't taken and when he was 20 or 25 years old but it was tucking as you as perfect 45 behind the word of God how many has ever seen the uh the picture of the Bride [Music] in the word from the top to the bottom she's fortified behind the word that's what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world and nothing in time could ever change what God thought about me people can change your mind churches can change their mind family can change their mind but God can never have a better fault of me Hallelujah God's first thought is his best Vision one says according I'm face to close seriously according to Nancy has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that which should be holy Without Blame before him in love he has made us accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah brother Joel he didn't come he didn't come and choose you because you was perfect he didn't come pick me because I was flawless he didn't come pick you because you were Shameless but he came and chose you because down inside of you had the ability to become perfect down inside of you have the ability to become flawless Hallelujah you love the Lord he chose you because you had the ability the devil is only a bluff he's a squatter you never was a child of the devil in the first place you was always a child of God you came from God and you're going back to God Hallelujah God seen you Victorious he's seen you shouting for joy he's seen you overcoming lady I see you he always ain't seen you bear in The Briar patches and overcome the sharp rocks of persecution and famine and
