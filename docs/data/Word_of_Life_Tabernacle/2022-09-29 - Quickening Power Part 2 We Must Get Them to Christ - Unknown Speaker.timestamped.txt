[27:47] Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be

[27:53] over every circumstance Lord even death
[27:56] itself could not stand before the Rising
[27:59] Sun we're so grateful Lord that you've
[28:02] risen all the Gloom the Lord has gone
[28:05] away all the Mist is melted away Lord
[28:07] and we can see you Lord is the living
[28:10] Christ The God Who can take care of us
[28:13] who who intercedes on our behalf we
[28:16] thank you for that tonight I I pray for
[28:19] each one Lord for every need that was
[28:22] mentioned here tonight I think also
[28:24] these folks in Florida Lord with the
[28:26] hurricane bearing down on all my pray
[28:29] you bless them Lord and others Believers
[28:31] in that area but the Jeremy down there
[28:33] Lord about to go to work fixing the the
[28:36] electricity I pray you to help him and
[28:38] keep him safe Lord we we we're a body
[28:41] Lord we need one another for you to help
[28:44] us to know that Lord we thank you for
[28:46] the resurrection Lord that we feel Among
[28:49] Us oh God that we can know that you're
[28:52] alive Lord you're living if you're alive
[28:54] if you're in the house all death has to
[28:57] flee we're thankful for that we pray you
[28:59] to heal every sick body or all those
[29:01] that couldn't be here I pray you bless
[29:02] him tonight keep them safe we pray bless
[29:06] us now as we hear your word in Jesus
[29:08] name amen
[29:10] [Music]
[29:13] Hallelujah and you love the Lord tonight
[29:15] amen Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 and
[29:19] then we'll read Romans 8 11. Once Again
[29:21] Luke 24 49 and Romans 8 11.
[29:27] we found last week that the Rising Sun
[29:29] dispels all Gloom
[29:32] amen so aren't you happy to be in the
[29:34] house of the Lord tonight
[29:36] why because he he lives he's risen and
[29:41] so that means we preach a resurrected
[29:44] savior a resurrected gospel not a gospel
[29:48] of gloom and doom but one of happiness
[29:50] and joy and peace and a future and hope
[29:54] in a world of darkness and a world of
[29:56] fear in a world of pain and we feel that
[29:59] too because we're human aren't you glad
[30:02] for a message of Hope tonight amen Luke
[30:05] 24 49 says behold I send the promise of
[30:09] my father upon you but Terry in the city
[30:12] of Jerusalem until you be endued with
[30:15] power from on high Romans 8 and 11.
[30:23] so there's got to be a power come
[30:28] Romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him
[30:31] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[30:34] you
[30:35] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[30:37] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[30:42] his spirit that dwelleth in you aren't
[30:46] you glad you have that Spirit tonight
[30:48] amen I pray the Lord without his
[30:50] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[30:56] so the Rising Sun dispels Gloom
[31:00] and brother Branham goes on to explain
[31:01] how that happened he said the Trinity of
[31:04] the devil death hell and the grave for
[31:07] Satan is the author of death he is the
[31:10] possessor of hell and also the grave so
[31:13] I want you to notice now this is Satan
[31:17] encapsulating Lucifer if we could we
[31:19] could call him that by his original name
[31:22] Satan encapsulates the Trinity of the
[31:26] devil he is death hell and the grave
[31:29] because he's the possessor of that he
[31:32] was the possessor of hell he was the
[31:34] possessor of the Grave he was the
[31:36] possessor of death that was his
[31:38] territory that's who he was and that was
[31:41] the Trinity of Satan being caused by one
[31:44] thing that was death he said death you
[31:47] go at the grave and being a sinner you
[31:49] go to hell he said all the very one
[31:52] thing the Trinity of Satan so it's all
[31:54] represented in that one person and that
[31:57] becomes important later on he said all
[31:59] being represented in all the very one
[32:01] thing the Trinity of Satan which was
[32:03] death that had held man in captivity all
[32:06] these years but now he said the true
[32:09] Trinity of God
[32:11] being one manifested in Christ who was
[32:15] life and had broke the seals and
[32:18] conquered the enemy and Rose up the one
[32:21] and true Living God
[32:24] so here on one side is death hell in the
[32:27] grave and here is the Father the Son the
[32:30] holy spirit encapsulated in one Christ
[32:33] one anointed one who rose up from the
[32:37] grave broke the seals conquered the
[32:39] enemy you want to see who God is that's
[32:41] God
[32:43] that's God that's who he is Christ the
[32:46] Risen Savior the raising in a body but
[32:49] he didn't stay in that form but he
[32:52] poured himself out
[32:54] all the quality that was in Christ
[32:56] everything that he was he poured into
[33:00] the church do we believe that tonight we
[33:03] understand that from the unveiling of
[33:04] God that God in morphy changed his Mast
[33:08] from being the son that Rose from the
[33:10] grave he changed it that God came and
[33:13] dwelt in his people and he lives in you
[33:15] and I tonight
[33:17] that's quickening power
[33:19] amen so he rose up the one and true
[33:22] Living God I'm he that was dead and I'm
[33:24] Alive forevermore and have the keys of
[33:27] death in hell so the Trinity of God
[33:30] overcame the Trinity of Satan Satan you
[33:33] understand how brother Brown is using
[33:34] the word Trinity we don't believe in
[33:36] three different persons we believe in
[33:38] one person Jesus Christ
[33:40] all of those manifestations in Christ
[33:43] and so he said the true the Trinity of
[33:46] God being one manifested in Christ he
[33:48] said I'm he that was dead and I'm Alive
[33:51] forevermore God he said have the keys of
[33:53] death and held God and one made man and
[33:55] dwelt Among Us and conquered every enemy
[34:00] and had proved that the Trinity of Satan
[34:02] was conquered what does the resurrection
[34:05] do Resurrection proves that Satan has
[34:09] been conquered
[34:10] that's what it does in our lives when
[34:13] there's life among us when when the
[34:15] Resurrection comes in our lives when
[34:17] we're we're raised from the dead it
[34:19] proves that you're not just a church
[34:21] member it proves that you're more than
[34:24] just another follower of the message but
[34:27] there's a there's a reality to it and I
[34:29] want our young people to understand this
[34:31] I want our young married couples to
[34:33] understand this I want our old people to
[34:34] understand this I want to understand
[34:36] this myself that there's got to be at
[34:39] some point in our life where we prove
[34:41] who we are and we'll never prove that
[34:43] we're perfect but but in the flesh but
[34:46] we can prove who we are as Christians we
[34:48] can prove that we are the the seed of
[34:51] God how do we do that by raising from
[34:53] dead trespasses and sins and by living
[34:56] an overcoming life
[34:58] amen and by manifesting the power of God
[35:02] back into our generation
[35:04] amen we're not here just to play Church
[35:07] we're not here just to read sermons
[35:10] or or to or listen to a prophet that's
[35:13] not what we're here for that's baby
[35:15] stuff
[35:16] people can do that and it's good but
[35:18] it's stuff you anybody can do anybody
[35:21] can say they believe in a prophet
[35:23] anybody can come into church and sit on
[35:25] a Pew anybody can do those things but to
[35:29] become the word
[35:30] to become Christ
[35:32] he said well how do I be coming will you
[35:34] become him by by manifesting he is in
[35:37] your life when you would do certain
[35:39] things you don't do those things anymore
[35:41] why because of him and some things you
[35:43] would never do on your own you were you
[35:45] would be unable to do on your own but
[35:47] Christ does it in in you amen he said
[35:50] nothing is impossible to you
[35:53] amen
[35:55] I'm getting ahead of myself tonight but
[35:56] I just want to just just keep preaching
[35:59] it because that's the way brother random
[36:00] presented this if you go listen to the
[36:02] sermon it is the rising of the Sun
[36:05] he said he proved that the Trinity of
[36:07] Satan was conquered and that the Trinity
[36:10] of God was made known because only God
[36:12] Alone had power to bring life back again
[36:15] he was that Emmanuel God had been
[36:19] manifested in the flesh no wonder the
[36:22] Branham goes on to say no wonder he made
[36:23] these claims in Matthew 28 18 Jesus came
[36:27] and spoken to them saying all power
[36:29] someone say all power
[36:31] you know how much that means all of it
[36:34] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[36:39] in Earth
[36:40] so how much power does the devil have
[36:46] all power was given to Christ
[36:48] Jason you could answer that then how
[36:50] much power does the devil have
[36:52] none no power
[36:55] well he's a bluff
[36:57] that's what we're taught he's a bluff
[36:59] he's toothless
[37:02] he doesn't have any rights to walk on
[37:04] your land he doesn't have any rights to
[37:06] come against you in sickness he doesn't
[37:09] have any rights he does it but he
[37:11] doesn't have a right to do it which
[37:13] makes him a criminal
[37:15] so we don't have to respect him when he
[37:17] comes in we kick him out
[37:20] right when he comes in our families we
[37:22] kick him out when he comes in the church
[37:24] we kick him out right because we're the
[37:27] beneficiaries of the resurrected Jesus
[37:29] Christ we we have his spirit that same
[37:31] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[37:33] dead we don't have to bow down to those
[37:35] things we don't have to give in to Leo
[37:37] to see us we don't have to give him to
[37:39] deadness and coldness I hope you hear me
[37:41] tonight church we don't have to give in
[37:43] to the way the world's going we can be
[37:45] different we can stand for God we can
[37:47] live for God we can be everything that
[37:50] God wants us to be
[37:51] that's right
[37:53] hey man so he made these claims all
[37:56] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[37:57] Earth
[37:58] go you therefore and teach All Nations
[38:00] baptizing them in the name of the father
[38:02] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[38:04] teaching them to observe all things
[38:06] whatsoever I have commanded you he says
[38:09] and lo I am with you always
[38:11] even unto the end of the world
[38:15] so now he says I have given all power to
[38:18] you and and he said I want you to go and
[38:21] do this all power is given to me so I
[38:24] want you to go and do this using my
[38:26] power and he tells them what to do and
[38:29] then Peter does it on the day of
[38:31] Pentecost
[38:32] then we'll get to that in a moment now
[38:34] he had conquered both death hell and the
[38:36] grave
[38:37] not only did he do that and come out
[38:39] Triumph with all the power in heavens
[38:42] and earth all that was the father all
[38:45] that was the Holy Ghost and all that
[38:48] there ever was was in him
[38:50] right amen I just love to talk about him
[38:53] don't you
[38:54] amen he said all powers in heaven and on
[38:57] Earth is given unto me everything else
[38:59] is powerless
[39:01] he had conquered it
[39:03] and I think sometimes we give it I'm
[39:05] gonna try not to editorialize too much
[39:07] tonight because I'm I'm going to be
[39:09] pressed for time but we give things
[39:12] power that don't have any power
[39:15] by just assuming that we can't overcome
[39:17] it but just assuming that we're going to
[39:19] have to bow to it no he has no power
[39:23] Satan is powerless right
[39:25] right everything else is powerless he
[39:28] had conquered it he turned me down a
[39:30] little bit I'm probably hurting
[39:31] somebody's ears they're in the back
[39:34] he said now he said then not only that
[39:37] he sent word to his disciples his
[39:39] believing fear not for I am he that was
[39:42] dead and is alive again forevermore
[39:46] and I have the keys to death and hell
[39:48] I've already conquered it how many
[39:51] believe that tonight
[39:52] don't fear anymore
[39:55] for every someone say every
[39:58] every four ordained predestinated seed
[40:01] of God shall come to life when that
[40:05] light spreads across the Earth of the
[40:07] Glorious gospel don't give up on your
[40:09] children don't give up on your loved
[40:10] ones don't give up on those that are out
[40:12] of the Ark of Safety every
[40:14] predestinated seed oh I'm so glad every
[40:18] one of them will come to life
[40:20] don't fear anymore everyone shall come
[40:22] to life when that light spreads across
[40:24] the Earth of the Glorious gospel he said
[40:26] in every age
[40:28] it'll bring forth the crop that God
[40:30] ordained it to do he had raised from the
[40:35] dead he said oh what a wonderful thing
[40:37] that is I am alive or quickened the word
[40:40] means the word Quicken he said the Greek
[40:42] word means that something that's made
[40:44] alive
[40:45] after death
[40:46] he said like the seed that goes into the
[40:49] Earth it has to die every bit of the
[40:52] seed it has to rot every bit of the seed
[40:55] and every bit of the life that was in
[40:56] the seed has to come forth again
[40:59] now let's watch that closely every bit
[41:01] of the seed has to rot
[41:04] so don't think it's strange when you go
[41:06] through trials
[41:07] don't think it's strange because that
[41:09] outer that shell of the seed has got to
[41:12] rot
[41:13] have you ever looked at a seed in the
[41:14] microscope you see there's an outer
[41:16] shell and then there's an inner there's
[41:18] a pulp and there's three parts but the
[41:21] inside of that is a germ of life that's
[41:23] just like you that outer man's got to
[41:25] melt away it's got to got to rot there's
[41:27] got to be a rottening of the seed it has
[41:30] to rot every bit of the seed everything
[41:32] that's going to have quickening power
[41:33] it's got to die before it can have
[41:35] quickening power
[41:36] you've got to die to yourself you got to
[41:38] die to your Ambitions you got to die
[41:40] I've got to die to what I want and what
[41:42] I what I see is as the future for myself
[41:44] and what you see as the future for
[41:46] yourself you got to be willing to die to
[41:48] that and say Lord I want what you want
[41:50] for me
[41:51] so the seed has to go to the Earth it
[41:53] has to die every bit of the seed every
[41:55] bit of the seed has to rot every middle
[41:58] of the seed and every bit of the life
[42:00] that was in the seed has to come forth
[42:02] again
[42:04] he said he was quickened
[42:06] not only that he said and we'll send the
[42:09] same life
[42:11] that quickened me so not just him that
[42:13] was quickened but he said he would send
[42:15] the same life that quickened me the
[42:18] power that brought me from the grave I
[42:20] will send it upon you to Quicken you
[42:22] that where I am there you will be also
[42:25] aren't you glad you can be with him
[42:28] how about the quickening power
[42:30] how are we going to go to heaven
[42:32] by quickening power
[42:34] by the Holy Ghost
[42:36] that's how we go to heaven in Luke 24
[42:39] the 24th chapter of the 49th verse he
[42:41] said behold I send the promise to the
[42:43] father upon you but carry your weights
[42:45] you in the city of Jerusalem until
[42:46] you're being dude with power from on
[42:48] high he said to show that not only did
[42:50] he draw all the benefits out of it so
[42:53] that's for himself now what is he
[42:54] drawing the benefits out of it that seed
[42:57] the seed is the word
[42:59] all right the seed had to die but he
[43:01] draw all the benefits out of the Old
[43:03] Testament word
[43:05] right that was written about him he drew
[43:08] out all the benefits for the Joe all of
[43:09] it didn't leave any of it oh that's the
[43:12] way I want to be I want to be able to
[43:13] stand there like he did with Alan saying
[43:15] in the volume of the book it's written
[43:17] to me I'm going to draw all the benefits
[43:19] I'm gonna draw out healing I'm gonna
[43:20] draw salvation I'm gonna draw I'm gonna
[43:22] draw Joy I'm gonna draw peace I'm going
[43:24] to draw every bit of it out of that seed
[43:27] so he drew all of the promises he drew
[43:30] all the benefits but he didn't just stop
[43:33] there but he shared those benefits
[43:36] amen see we don't we don't have to die
[43:40] physically to draw those benefits
[43:43] because we couldn't atone for our own
[43:46] flesh our own salvation with the death
[43:48] of our own flesh so there had to come we
[43:50] die spiritually but we were crucified
[43:53] with him but he died physically so that
[43:55] you and I could benefit in this life
[43:59] right we can benefit in this life we
[44:02] don't have to die we couldn't pay for
[44:03] our own sins if we died then we couldn't
[44:06] repent we'd have no chance because we
[44:08] were Sinners he was not a sinner but he
[44:10] come to life he was the first round gets
[44:13] into it later in this sermon the first
[44:14] wave sheath that was waved across the
[44:16] people to show us what a resurrected son
[44:19] was
[44:20] the Bible puts it this way it was the
[44:21] firstborn among many brethren
[44:24] right so he come out to show us what was
[44:26] possible
[44:27] and he shared those benefits
[44:30] he come to redeem or to bring to life
[44:33] those predestinated seed that God seen
[44:36] before the foundation of the world put
[44:38] their names in The Book of Life
[44:40] and here they are on the Earth
[44:42] without a hope
[44:44] you say that he said he came not only to
[44:46] be the blessing but to share the
[44:48] blessing with every predestinated
[44:52] seed
[44:53] he said now if the seed wasn't on the
[44:55] earth it could not live it had to be on
[44:57] the earth and also germatized two
[45:01] requirements for the seed to live it had
[45:03] to be on the earth and it had to be
[45:05] germanized what that means is it had to
[45:07] it had to be with the male if you put it
[45:09] like that if you have a rooster and a
[45:12] hens the hens have to be with the
[45:14] rooster or the eggs won't ever come to
[45:16] life
[45:17] they're still good eating but they won't
[45:18] come to life
[45:20] I'll never be chickens
[45:22] right and so if there was no German
[45:25] germanization if you could say it that
[45:27] way if there was nothing there from from
[45:30] the father there was no quickening power
[45:33] the seed would just stay there on the
[45:35] earth
[45:36] who am I he said no matter how long it's
[45:39] kept in darkness
[45:41] it'll come forth
[45:43] when the son shines upon it
[45:47] he said notice now he come to share it
[45:50] with us
[45:52] no wonder the gospel is good news
[45:55] the very word gospel means the good news
[45:59] how many know that tonight
[46:01] the good news what if a man died for our
[46:04] sake that's good news
[46:06] if Christ was born that's good news but
[46:09] never was there news like this news that
[46:12] he who made the promise confirmed the
[46:15] promise
[46:16] he didn't offer us an empty promise or
[46:19] something it wasn't like a Salesman that
[46:21] would come along and say this is the way
[46:23] your new car is going to drive this is
[46:25] the way it's going to be he didn't do
[46:26] that what did he do he became the
[46:29] promise
[46:30] right he manifested the promise
[46:34] I've always wondered about Ford dealers
[46:36] that didn't drive Forts and Chevrolet
[46:38] dealers that didn't drive Chevrolets and
[46:41] Toyota dealers that didn't drive Toyotas
[46:43] but Jesus didn't tell us to do something
[46:46] that he didn't do
[46:47] right but he actually did it
[46:50] yeah and he did it on our behalf
[46:52] and he's alive forever more now that's
[46:55] the good news he said he's alive forever
[46:57] more you made the promises confirmed the
[47:00] promise He's Alive forevermore and have
[47:01] the keys of both death and hell in his
[47:05] hand
[47:06] all the Gloom was shook away
[47:10] there was no more Gloom to be seen for
[47:13] the sun was up
[47:15] from the grave
[47:17] you've been out on a foggy morning and
[47:19] especially gets foggy down here by this
[47:21] River and Hardy if you drive through
[47:23] there at a certain time in the morning
[47:24] at a certain time of the year the fog
[47:27] can be so thick that you can't hardly
[47:29] see but just as the sun comes up the fog
[47:33] begins to clear out and there's no way
[47:36] for the fog to remain past the midday
[47:39] Sun
[47:40] once the sun is fully risen the fog's
[47:43] gone
[47:44] where did it go it went back to where it
[47:46] came from the Gloom cannot stay
[47:49] or you hear me tonight the night time
[47:51] cannot stay the darkness cannot stay sin
[47:54] could not stay sickness could not stay
[47:56] disease could not stay depression could
[47:59] not stay
[48:01] right you realize why we need a
[48:02] resurrected Christ in our services a
[48:06] resurrected Christ in our preaching a
[48:08] resurrected Christ in our living
[48:10] why because when we when we come across
[48:13] darkness when we come across sickness
[48:15] when we come across he's already
[48:16] conquered those things
[48:18] so he's fighting for us he's already
[48:21] given us the keys to overcome those
[48:23] things and it shakes every bit of the
[48:25] Gloom away
[48:27] hey man hey man now he said there was no
[48:30] more Gloom to be seen for the sun was up
[48:32] from the grave there was no well he will
[48:34] come or he may come
[48:36] now watch this this is where it's
[48:38] important some people say well
[48:39] doctrine's not important yeah it is
[48:41] because if your Doctrine says he will
[48:43] come
[48:44] or he may come that he had already come
[48:48] the gospel good news go and read what
[48:50] Paul has to say about those who denied
[48:51] the resurrection
[48:53] he calls them out names them and comes
[48:56] down really hard on him he said their
[48:57] words will eat like a canker that's
[48:59] gangrene
[49:01] and it'll eat up your flesh
[49:03] their words will eat like a canker he
[49:05] said because they believe the
[49:06] resurrection has already passed
[49:08] so there's no that's the physical
[49:10] resurrection of this body there's
[49:12] nothing to look forward to so Doctrine
[49:14] does matter we believe that the Gloom
[49:16] has been shaken away
[49:18] and so now we we believe we are risen
[49:20] with him
[49:21] but there's a Resurrection coming
[49:24] right now
[49:25] he said the sun was up there was no well
[49:27] he will come or he may come he had
[49:30] already come
[49:31] the gospel good news he said notice the
[49:33] very message of the Gospel itself is to
[49:35] prove to the people that he has risen
[49:38] so now watch he says go into the upper
[49:41] room going and Terry in Jerusalem until
[49:44] until you receive power you're endued
[49:48] with power from on high
[49:51] so that was their mission was to go and
[49:53] do that and then their mission was to
[49:56] spread the gospel
[49:57] over the the ends of the Earth
[50:00] and by doing that brother Branham always
[50:02] taught us the gospel was not to just go
[50:04] and preach the word but it was to
[50:07] demonstrate the power and manifestation
[50:09] of the Gospel
[50:11] right and and we'll show that in just a
[50:13] moment now he said the very messages of
[50:16] the Gospel itself is to prove to the
[50:18] people that he's risen and that's why we
[50:21] can't preach one thing and live another
[50:24] because if we preach one thing God help
[50:26] me because if we preach one thing and
[50:28] live another if we preach happiness and
[50:30] live and Gloom
[50:32] right if we preach healing and live in a
[50:35] state of of unbelief
[50:37] if we preach and yet those things will
[50:39] come at us just like everybody else but
[50:41] we can't preach one thing and live
[50:42] another because if we do what we're
[50:45] doing is we're actually denying the very
[50:47] gospel itself because it wasn't meant
[50:49] just to be preached
[50:51] it was meant to be left
[50:53] right it was meant to be preached yes
[50:55] but also to be lived by the preacher
[50:57] that's why a preacher has to be living
[51:03] all right
[51:05] because we can send tapes and books and
[51:08] it's wonderful and we're trying doing
[51:09] our best to get them in every land in
[51:11] every nation and every every tongue we
[51:13] should do that but when they see a
[51:15] living a living manifestation of this
[51:17] message
[51:19] that's what the gospel preached is
[51:23] right right it's a living manifestation
[51:26] and so I have told you before I think
[51:28] but many times it's us going and just
[51:31] the effort of going and caring and and
[51:34] loving and showing that we care about
[51:35] them means as much to them as the words
[51:38] we say
[51:39] and I would say that that's true even in
[51:41] a church and I don't want to get myself
[51:42] in trouble here because maybe I don't
[51:44] always do but I will say it's if I don't
[51:46] it's because of ignorance not a lack of
[51:48] Desire but maybe not always do as much
[51:50] as I could but you show people that you
[51:52] love them
[51:54] you show people that you love them you
[51:56] show your family that you love them it's
[51:58] one thing to tell them about a prophet
[51:59] one thing to tell them about a message
[52:01] it's another thing to live that in front
[52:03] of them
[52:04] amen
[52:06] he said go tell my disciples I'm risen
[52:08] from the dead and I'll meet with them to
[52:12] confirm this to them
[52:15] he said oh God how in this last day now
[52:19] watch you he updates it he said there
[52:21] shall be light again across the Earth
[52:24] and I'll prove to my disciples Glory go
[52:28] tell them that I'm Not Dead
[52:31] I'm not a tradition
[52:33] but I'm a living Christ
[52:36] oh when we bring when we make this
[52:38] message of tradition
[52:40] we are we are doing a disservice to the
[52:43] living Christ
[52:45] I'm not dead I'm not a tradition I'm a
[52:49] living Christ
[52:50] that's why God always has to have a
[52:52] bride he always has to there always has
[52:54] to be a new generation and every
[52:56] generation has to have its own Revival
[52:58] you say well brother Ben we can't have
[53:00] Revival come Sunday morning we'll look
[53:02] at that maybe a little bit uh if we get
[53:05] to it in the sermon because the Lord's
[53:07] been stirring me about that well there's
[53:08] no Revival anywhere no there's not out
[53:10] there but there is right here
[53:14] hey man there may not be any Revival out
[53:16] there in the Gloom but we're in here the
[53:18] sun is risen
[53:20] are you with me now every one of us has
[53:22] that that in our hearts that resurrected
[53:25] Christ
[53:26] I'm not a tradition
[53:28] I am a living Christ I'll meet them
[53:32] who am I I'll meet them take this
[53:34] message to my disciples that I am risen
[53:37] from the dead the gospel good news you
[53:40] say is that right Hebrews 13 8 said he's
[53:43] the same yesterday today and forever
[53:46] we as beneficiaries are to prove his
[53:49] life is is in us now
[53:52] the beneficiaries of this life
[53:55] how would we prove and we'll get more
[53:56] into this maybe next Wednesday night but
[53:58] how could we prove that we are his
[54:00] beneficiaries
[54:02] well we have what he had
[54:05] right and we're beneficiaries of what
[54:07] his spirit
[54:09] that dwells in us so we have what he had
[54:13] what does that mean when he was reviled
[54:16] he reviled not again
[54:17] we do the same thing
[54:19] when he was persecuted he threatened not
[54:22] we do the same thing
[54:23] we act like he acted
[54:26] when he was confronted with death he
[54:29] believed God
[54:30] we was confronted even with his own
[54:32] death you realize he did not use his
[54:34] power
[54:35] to convince others and convince himself
[54:38] but he used the word brother the Bible
[54:40] said he went down believing the word of
[54:41] a backslidden prophet a vaccine King
[54:43] named David because he said I will not
[54:46] suffer you your soul to see corruption
[54:48] your bodies see corruption what did he
[54:50] do he went down he said I would not
[54:51] leave your soul in Hell we'll not suffer
[54:52] my Holy One to see corruption and he
[54:54] went down believing the word of a
[54:55] backslid king
[54:57] because it was the word of God it wasn't
[55:00] about the man
[55:01] it was God that spoke it he went down
[55:04] believing and he come up Resurrected
[55:07] oh my We Believe like he believed
[55:11] we live like he lived brother man who
[55:13] said if I had the life of Beethoven
[55:15] I'd write music
[55:17] by the life of John Dillinger I'd go
[55:19] Robin
[55:20] I'd go Robin places if I had the life of
[55:23] brother Harold I could be an engineer
[55:25] and work on cars and work on things but
[55:27] I don't
[55:28] I have the life of John Pruitt running
[55:30] through my veins of my father and he was
[55:33] pretty much useless at everything and I
[55:34] am too
[55:36] but boy could he talk
[55:40] but but that's because that life is in
[55:42] me in the natural
[55:44] or you hear me today but there's a life
[55:46] in you that's more than your natural
[55:48] life your life is a spiritual life
[55:51] whatever he did you you can do
[55:55] that's a strong statement isn't it but
[55:57] the Bible says if it does something
[55:58] different from the groom it isn't the
[56:00] bride
[56:02] amen we need to we need to accept that
[56:05] possibility tonight
[56:07] we need to just reach out and grab hold
[56:09] that possibility well brother Ben
[56:10] there's only you know 50 or 60 of us
[56:13] sometimes and it was just a little group
[56:15] and on a Wednesday night just a little
[56:17] group of adults and the kids half of us
[56:19] are asleep and well there's not very
[56:21] many Jesus had 12 and they were all
[56:24] asleep
[56:29] kept going praying and having to go back
[56:31] and wake them up
[56:33] to be like Jesus
[56:37] as part of that you put them to sleep
[56:39] you get to wake them up
[56:42] but he went back and woke him up and
[56:43] went back again they fell asleep again
[56:46] that don't mean it's not God sometimes
[56:48] you got to go through some things
[56:50] sometimes you gotta I heard a that
[56:52] message and I don't I want this church
[56:54] to grow on every every seat to be filled
[56:56] but Charles Spurgeon said this he said
[56:59] just because the church is Big doesn't
[57:00] mean it's right he said it could be
[57:01] swollen
[57:04] things get bigger after they die
[57:09] what are we holding on to it's not the
[57:12] numbers
[57:13] what is it it's Christ
[57:14] a living Christ a resurrected Christ and
[57:18] where the carcass is they're the Eagles
[57:19] will be gathered so we preach the word
[57:21] but the job of the island when we preach
[57:23] the word the the people come that want
[57:26] the word and the rest of them will never
[57:28] show up
[57:30] now look we are to prove oh that sounds
[57:34] harsh and I'm not I'm not Downy for
[57:36] being gone sometimes that's part of it
[57:37] but it's just we want the word something
[57:40] about the eagle wants the fresh kill of
[57:42] the word we won't live without it we
[57:45] won't make it without it
[57:46] amen or was I at
[57:49] he said
[57:51] we are his beneficiaries are to prove
[57:53] his life is in us now the beneficiaries
[57:55] of this life
[57:57] the life he said there never was a life
[57:59] lived like it
[58:00] Oh my he was the son of God he died that
[58:03] shut it out but when he raised again
[58:05] from the dead on Easter morning then we
[58:08] as his servants are commissioned by him
[58:10] to go into all the world and to bring
[58:12] this good news to every person
[58:16] that he is living
[58:18] and now listen
[58:20] okay and this is this is important
[58:22] he said how can we do it by word only
[58:27] how can we do it by word only
[58:30] now I know we've been conditioned to
[58:31] that or it's the word the word the word
[58:33] yes we need to have the word you must
[58:35] have the word
[58:37] without the word you don't have anything
[58:40] but how can we do it by word only
[58:43] for it is written the gospel came not by
[58:45] word only but through the power and the
[58:47] manifestation of the Holy Spirit to
[58:50] prove that he is alive
[58:52] he said now if there is another gospel
[58:54] as Paul spoke to one of the groups I'm
[58:55] so surprised that you turned to another
[58:58] gospel now what gospel is that
[59:01] no no power
[59:04] word only
[59:06] try what he's saying if there's another
[59:08] gospel it's Paul spoke to one of the
[59:10] groups I'm so surprised you turn to
[59:11] another gospel which there is no other
[59:13] but a make-believe gospel to a
[59:15] denominational fiction turning from that
[59:18] good news here's where Paul says that
[59:21] Galatians 1 6 I Marvel that you're so
[59:23] soon removed from him that called you
[59:24] into the grace of Christ unto another
[59:26] gospel which is not another but there'll
[59:29] be some that trouble you and would
[59:30] pervert the gospel of Christ
[59:33] Oh my he said and because I live you
[59:35] live also and I live in you in the works
[59:38] that I do John 14 12 The Works that I do
[59:40] will identify myself in you what a
[59:44] message
[59:45] he said no wonder we've had a dark world
[59:48] of theology
[59:50] and I've had people tell me Well we
[59:52] don't want to go back to Pentecost and I
[59:53] agree with that I don't want
[59:54] denominationalism
[59:57] I don't want the Dark World of theology
[1:00:01] Pentecost was wrong in their Doctrine
[1:00:04] they were wrong in their Doctrine it
[1:00:06] wasn't that they were just over enthused
[1:00:08] they were wrong because they they said
[1:00:10] speaking in tongues was the evidence of
[1:00:11] the Holy Ghost they wouldn't accept the
[1:00:14] light of the new birth they wouldn't
[1:00:15] accept the light of all these Mysteries
[1:00:17] that were revealed they rejected their
[1:00:19] messenger
[1:00:21] right they turned it down I don't want
[1:00:23] to go back to that but I don't want to
[1:00:24] go back to Luther either
[1:00:26] I don't want to go back to Westie either
[1:00:28] I want that plus
[1:00:31] hey man we've had a dark world of
[1:00:33] theology but in the evening time there
[1:00:35] shall come alive again there will be a
[1:00:38] resurrection in the evening time he said
[1:00:40] it shall be light at the evening time
[1:00:43] now the very essence of the message that
[1:00:45] was sent he has risen from the dead we
[1:00:48] his beneficiaries we who share the
[1:00:50] resurrection with him draw benefits from
[1:00:53] this by proving to the world that He Is
[1:00:56] Alive
[1:00:57] watch here he is again he said we cannot
[1:00:59] do it by word only
[1:01:01] yeah we cannot do it by some tradition
[1:01:04] of man
[1:01:05] we only reflect exactly what we're
[1:01:09] pointing to
[1:01:11] so if you took a mirror or we don't
[1:01:14] really have mirrors much anymore we have
[1:01:15] selfie
[1:01:16] cameras have the selfie mode on them and
[1:01:20] you can turn them around look at
[1:01:21] yourself
[1:01:22] it only looks at it only reflects what
[1:01:25] it's looking at
[1:01:27] right the only way you could get an
[1:01:28] accurate reflection is by pointing it
[1:01:31] straight at the object
[1:01:33] what he's saying we only reflect exactly
[1:01:35] what we're pointing to
[1:01:38] now here's a quote I know you've heard I
[1:01:41] know you've heard it many times but now
[1:01:43] think about it in and this is why I do
[1:01:45] this the way that I do it now you've
[1:01:46] heard what he's been saying
[1:01:49] and we're going to go to this quote and
[1:01:50] then I'm going to get out of it is the
[1:01:52] rising of the Sun for just a few moments
[1:01:54] and talk to you about these things and
[1:01:55] then we'll we'll close
[1:01:58] but it's it's a quote that I'm sure
[1:01:59] you're very familiar with
[1:02:01] he said I'm afraid today that too many
[1:02:03] of us are not getting people to Christ
[1:02:07] we're getting them to a church to a
[1:02:09] theory
[1:02:11] but we must get them to Christ
[1:02:13] he is the only one and the only one that
[1:02:16] has life
[1:02:18] aren't you glad he has life
[1:02:20] he that hath the son has life
[1:02:23] Christ
[1:02:25] now I've heard that preach many
[1:02:26] different ways mostly I've heard it
[1:02:28] preach that we needed to preach less
[1:02:30] about brother Branham and more about
[1:02:31] Jesus Christ but I don't think that's
[1:02:33] where brother random is going here
[1:02:36] because the Baptists Don't Preach about
[1:02:37] brother Branham
[1:02:40] they preached Christ crucified or they
[1:02:42] say they do
[1:02:44] right the methodists Don't Preach about
[1:02:46] brother Branham the Pentecostals Don't
[1:02:47] Preach about brother Branham they do
[1:02:49] everything they can to to not remember
[1:02:50] it
[1:02:52] but but even though the ones that live
[1:02:54] during that time had to confess that he
[1:02:56] was a prophet
[1:02:58] but they're not pointing people to
[1:02:59] brother random
[1:03:01] and but now you could take it that way
[1:03:03] and that would be fine we do the message
[1:03:05] the prophecy changed the light change
[1:03:08] shifted focused from the from the
[1:03:10] prophet to the prophecy well the Branham
[1:03:13] says that in uh in uh in his sermon when
[1:03:17] you begin to preach about John coming
[1:03:18] down there to the river he actually says
[1:03:21] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:03:23] he says that the the change from the
[1:03:25] prophet to the prophecy so we could say
[1:03:28] that that's true but we must get them to
[1:03:30] Christ
[1:03:31] and not to denominational systems now
[1:03:34] but how do we do that
[1:03:37] do we do it just by talking more about
[1:03:39] Christ
[1:03:40] now think about it
[1:03:41] because again the Baptists have done
[1:03:43] good doing that
[1:03:45] they talk about Christ and that's good
[1:03:48] but many others that we could find the
[1:03:51] reformed they love to talk about Christ
[1:03:54] the the methodists love to talk about
[1:03:56] Christ they they talk about him
[1:03:58] constantly
[1:04:00] but they don't have the mirror replaced
[1:04:02] just exactly right
[1:04:04] right the mirror is not pointing to the
[1:04:07] real Christ
[1:04:08] now
[1:04:09] well if we want to know how to get them
[1:04:11] to Christ
[1:04:13] how can we do it well somebody has
[1:04:16] right Peter did on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:19] now remember when he talked about it as
[1:04:21] the rising of the sun we talked about
[1:04:22] quickening power he said he read that
[1:04:25] scripture that we read tonight he said
[1:04:27] go on tarry in Jerusalem until you're
[1:04:29] being dude with power from on high yeah
[1:04:31] so now he tells them to do that and then
[1:04:33] Peter gets up up on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:35] and gets them to Christ
[1:04:38] how does he do it
[1:04:40] well they were gathered there on the day
[1:04:42] of Pentecost and I won't read it because
[1:04:43] we've read it many times and you can go
[1:04:45] back and read to Acts chapter 2 but they
[1:04:47] were in one Accord in one place and
[1:04:49] tongues of fire fell on each one of them
[1:04:51] that were there
[1:04:52] and brother Reynolds says wow they were
[1:04:54] influenced by the Holy Ghost they went
[1:04:56] into action
[1:04:57] staggering like drunk man screaming
[1:05:00] speaking in tongues out into the street
[1:05:02] they went
[1:05:03] so the people thought that they were
[1:05:05] drunk
[1:05:06] and Peter stood up and he began to
[1:05:07] preach and you can go read the rest of
[1:05:09] the sermon but Acts 2 15 he said these
[1:05:11] are not drunk as you suppose seeing it
[1:05:13] as but the third hour of the day he said
[1:05:15] it is still mourning that they haven't
[1:05:17] gotten out and gotten drunk he said but
[1:05:20] this is that which was spoken by the
[1:05:23] prophet Joel
[1:05:24] this is God manifesting his word
[1:05:28] now Peter could have come and preached
[1:05:30] this same sermon
[1:05:32] without the manifestation of the spirit
[1:05:34] and it wouldn't amend anything to those
[1:05:36] people
[1:05:38] think about it it would have just been
[1:05:40] another sermon
[1:05:41] if Peter had said well all we need is
[1:05:43] word only and he walks out on the day of
[1:05:45] Pentecost he opens up his Bible and he
[1:05:47] comes up there and he just begins to
[1:05:49] teach them about Jesus they'd have
[1:05:51] stoned him off of there they'd run him
[1:05:53] up and put him on a cross
[1:05:54] and then one day they did but the reason
[1:05:57] why three thousand Souls were saved is
[1:05:59] because he got them to Christ yeah
[1:06:02] he got them to Christ
[1:06:04] now just hang with me for a minute
[1:06:07] it's God manifesting his word he says
[1:06:10] this is that
[1:06:12] so he goes on to indict them for
[1:06:14] crucifying their Messiah
[1:06:16] and he says in verse 36 therefore let
[1:06:18] all the house of Israel know assuredly
[1:06:20] that God hath made that same Jesus whom
[1:06:23] you have crucified both Lord and Christ
[1:06:28] now watch he's getting them to Christ
[1:06:30] but not just with words
[1:06:33] think about him
[1:06:35] now Christ what is Christ
[1:06:38] is the anointed one it means the
[1:06:41] anointed person
[1:06:43] the anointed person the anointed one the
[1:06:46] divinely anointed brother random calls
[1:06:48] it the anointed word because he was the
[1:06:49] word and so if he was the anointed one
[1:06:52] and that one was the word it's the
[1:06:53] anointed word
[1:06:56] now it means the Messiah Christos Christ
[1:07:00] in the New Testament is Messiah of the
[1:07:02] Old Testament that was the Greek name
[1:07:05] for the Messiah so anywhere you see
[1:07:07] Christ you could say Messiah
[1:07:09] so he was the Messiah that was to come
[1:07:12] that they looked for the anointed of God
[1:07:15] and that's what Messiah means anointed
[1:07:17] one
[1:07:17] the anointed one that was to come they
[1:07:19] did not believe that there was coming a
[1:07:22] theory but they believed there was
[1:07:24] coming a person
[1:07:26] right they did not believe that there
[1:07:28] was coming another book of the law
[1:07:30] but they believed there was coming a
[1:07:31] person
[1:07:33] but they didn't they missed him when he
[1:07:34] came
[1:07:36] but now and I know this is a little bit
[1:07:39] of depth tonight but you just have to
[1:07:40] hang with me and go and study it out and
[1:07:42] you'll you'll see it I believe and then
[1:07:44] if I'm wrong you just come tell me about
[1:07:46] it later but
[1:07:47] now but I don't believe I believe this
[1:07:49] is what he's saying now our Lord Jesus
[1:07:52] Christ is is the logos the word
[1:07:54] the logos also over the ram calls it the
[1:07:58] anointing
[1:07:59] because you can't separate the two and
[1:08:01] make it Christ yeah
[1:08:03] right our Lord Jesus Christ what did he
[1:08:05] say he was the Trinity of God
[1:08:07] all in one
[1:08:09] hey man the quickening power
[1:08:12] the word became flesh
[1:08:14] now brother Joel was preaching about and
[1:08:16] it struck me when brother Joel was
[1:08:18] preaching about how that the wise men
[1:08:19] came and they saw a baby in a Manger
[1:08:22] they saw they come and they followed
[1:08:24] they didn't just sit there but they
[1:08:26] followed the star and went through the
[1:08:28] great Pains of two years of a journey
[1:08:30] over from India or Babylon where they
[1:08:32] were and coming across into all through
[1:08:34] that those swamps and everything else to
[1:08:36] come to the place where Jesus lay it was
[1:08:39] a two-year journey and they get there
[1:08:41] and and when they get there they don't
[1:08:43] go and look in in the manger and see a
[1:08:46] book
[1:08:50] and think about it
[1:08:51] they didn't go and see a Bible like this
[1:08:54] one
[1:08:55] they could have went and found that they
[1:08:57] probably had some where they were yeah
[1:08:59] The Babylon was actually the seed of
[1:09:01] Jewish learning they probably knew all
[1:09:03] about the book
[1:09:04] that's why they were looking for a Star
[1:09:06] to announce the Messiah
[1:09:07] but the Branham in fact said that Daniel
[1:09:09] taught them about that
[1:09:12] and so they they were following their
[1:09:15] their forefather Daniel had taught them
[1:09:16] how to do that and and so they were
[1:09:18] looking for that to come but when they
[1:09:20] come and saw him they didn't see a book
[1:09:23] they didn't see a manuscript
[1:09:25] they didn't see it and go a little bit
[1:09:28] farther they didn't see a video
[1:09:30] they didn't see a a tape
[1:09:34] they saw a person right
[1:09:37] right he wouldn't have been the Christ
[1:09:38] if he was a book
[1:09:40] you hear me he wouldn't be the Christ if
[1:09:42] he was a a tape he wouldn't be the
[1:09:44] Christ if he was uh something else some
[1:09:47] tangible object he was a person yeah
[1:09:50] oh God
[1:09:52] brother says God does nothing without
[1:09:54] the agency of man
[1:09:57] understand he he was the Christ God
[1:09:59] didn't send the book
[1:10:00] oh God I hope we realize this tonight he
[1:10:04] become flesh
[1:10:06] and so on that day on Pentecost when
[1:10:08] when he presented Christ to them what
[1:10:10] did they do they said what shall we do
[1:10:12] what should we do and Peter said repent
[1:10:14] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:10:17] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:10:18] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:10:20] of the Holy Ghost what was he doing
[1:10:22] getting them to Christ
[1:10:23] that's right now watch how do we get
[1:10:26] people to Christ the same way that Peter
[1:10:27] did yeah we preach the word
[1:10:30] and point them to the Holy Ghost
[1:10:34] now think about it
[1:10:35] he got them to Christ
[1:10:37] but we know we can't take them to a
[1:10:39] living if there was a more a body a
[1:10:42] physical body here today that had had
[1:10:45] wounds in his hands and wounds he's
[1:10:47] still with me tonight I
[1:10:49] I just want to get this part out and
[1:10:51] then we'll quit but if he was a physical
[1:10:53] body and had blood running out of his
[1:10:55] wounds it wouldn't be Christ
[1:10:58] we're taught that it wouldn't be the son
[1:10:59] of man
[1:11:00] the day when the son of man was revealed
[1:11:02] he wasn't revealed that way
[1:11:05] he was revealed in another body
[1:11:09] oh God
[1:11:12] I feel like sometimes I I get into this
[1:11:15] stuff and it just for me but y'all just
[1:11:17] just hang with me tonight I we need to
[1:11:20] see Christ as in US
[1:11:23] he got them to Christ now one day that
[1:11:25] Corporal body will be there we don't
[1:11:26] want to take it too far we've seen that
[1:11:27] before but because there is a Corporal
[1:11:30] Body of Christ and brothers the
[1:11:32] Believers believe that they'll see him
[1:11:33] in that form again
[1:11:36] right but now in this form where is he
[1:11:39] at today if we're going to get people to
[1:11:41] Christ where are we going to take them
[1:11:43] to are we going to take them to a book
[1:11:45] or a tape or a denomination
[1:11:48] where do we take them to we take them to
[1:11:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:53] right the quickening power
[1:11:55] right because when they receive the Holy
[1:11:57] Ghost they receive Christ
[1:12:00] the anointing
[1:12:03] oh God and they become anointed once
[1:12:07] now watch we've almost made anointed
[1:12:10] ones a Bad Thing anointed ones is not a
[1:12:12] bad thing
[1:12:13] anointed ones is a good thing
[1:12:15] we want to be anointed once I don't mean
[1:12:18] you jump and run and shouting well I'd
[1:12:20] have a heart attack and some of you did
[1:12:21] but that doesn't mean that I'm still
[1:12:23] looking for Levi to make that that cat
[1:12:26] holler to make that nod actually but
[1:12:30] I promised I'd run all over the church
[1:12:32] so
[1:12:33] but but you know some that don't mean
[1:12:35] necessarily that you do that anointed
[1:12:37] means you're empowered for service
[1:12:39] you got power in your life
[1:12:42] hey man when sickness comes around on
[1:12:44] Monday you got power in your life it
[1:12:46] doesn't mean you'll never suffer
[1:12:47] sickness it means there's power in your
[1:12:49] life to overcome there's power in your
[1:12:52] life to overcome pornography there's
[1:12:53] power in your life to overcome the
[1:12:55] things of the world there's power in
[1:12:57] your life to overcome lust power in your
[1:12:59] life to overcome sickness power in your
[1:13:01] life to overcome dressing like the world
[1:13:02] acting like the world living like the
[1:13:05] world
[1:13:06] are you with me now power in your life
[1:13:09] you're an anointed one
[1:13:12] oh my
[1:13:14] amen why you have the gift of the Holy
[1:13:16] Ghost
[1:13:17] now watch he got them to Christ
[1:13:19] now Paul deals with spiritual gifts in
[1:13:22] First Corinthians 12. if you go and read
[1:13:24] that chapter he's dealing with the
[1:13:26] Corinthians with spiritual gifts because
[1:13:27] they had them but they didn't understand
[1:13:29] them
[1:13:30] so they had a problem with using the
[1:13:32] spiritual gifts and so Paul comes down
[1:13:35] there and he tells them he said I know
[1:13:37] you were Gentiles LED away with dumb
[1:13:39] idols
[1:13:40] he said so you're not going to
[1:13:41] understand these things
[1:13:43] but oh my but but see the the Jews would
[1:13:46] understand but the Corinthians they they
[1:13:48] were willing to let them move but they
[1:13:50] didn't understand how to put it in order
[1:13:52] so he says this and they couldn't
[1:13:54] distinguish between good gifts good
[1:13:56] anointed ones
[1:13:57] and bad gifts bad anointed ones
[1:14:01] or as we would call false anointed ones
[1:14:05] right or we could say it this way
[1:14:06] anointed false ones
[1:14:09] right because they're they're ones who
[1:14:12] are false at the bottom but they are
[1:14:14] anointed
[1:14:15] with a true anointing with the spirit of
[1:14:18] God
[1:14:20] so watch what Paul says he said
[1:14:22] wherefore I give you to understand
[1:14:23] because they couldn't tell the
[1:14:24] difference
[1:14:25] here would be one brother random talked
[1:14:26] about the one man that spoke in tongues
[1:14:28] was living with somebody else's wife
[1:14:29] here come another man that interpreted
[1:14:31] those tongues and this man was as
[1:14:34] righteous as he could be
[1:14:37] right and he was right
[1:14:39] and this one both Anointed with the same
[1:14:41] spirit
[1:14:42] and brother Madam deals with that and
[1:14:43] tells us about the wheat and the tares
[1:14:45] but they're both anointed it's not a
[1:14:46] different anointing but it's the same
[1:14:48] anointing
[1:14:49] anointed ones
[1:14:51] are you with me now
[1:14:53] anointed ones but they do not but see
[1:14:57] Christ
[1:14:58] is if we're going to get the people of
[1:15:00] Christ we got to get to people to the
[1:15:02] anointed word
[1:15:03] so Christ was a particular person and
[1:15:06] why you knew that he was the Christ was
[1:15:09] that he fulfilled the prophecy written
[1:15:11] about him
[1:15:12] right that's how you knew who he was
[1:15:15] because others might have come and had
[1:15:17] Miracles and done signs and wonders but
[1:15:19] this one came and was the word
[1:15:22] and said this day the scripture is
[1:15:24] fulfilled
[1:15:25] right there's been many who claim to
[1:15:27] have the Elijah but in this hour God
[1:15:29] proved to us who Elijah was
[1:15:32] why because he did what Elijah was
[1:15:34] supposed to do at the end time are you
[1:15:36] with me now he's going to prove the
[1:15:38] bride the same way
[1:15:40] how would he do it any different by
[1:15:41] becoming what a bride is supposed to be
[1:15:43] that's why we fight to have church
[1:15:46] that's why we fight to be have be a body
[1:15:48] to love one another because these things
[1:15:50] have to be in US
[1:15:52] we've got to be a body of Christ we got
[1:15:54] to be a bride on the earth that is
[1:15:56] exactly what he said it would be
[1:15:59] right amen
[1:16:01] so he says I give you to understand no
[1:16:03] man speaking by the spirit of God Called
[1:16:05] Jesus accursed
[1:16:07] so now watch he said they're not going
[1:16:09] to go against the word
[1:16:11] no man can say Jesus is the Lord but by
[1:16:15] the Holy Ghost
[1:16:16] right if they say with the word that's
[1:16:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:16:20] if they go against the word then that
[1:16:23] man is not is is is speaking heresy and
[1:16:26] again we understand it's real anointing
[1:16:28] but they couldn't tell the difference
[1:16:29] because one would say some wild Doctrine
[1:16:32] there were some wild doctrines back in
[1:16:34] those early ages and one would say some
[1:16:36] wild Doctrine but the other one would
[1:16:38] speak the truth both of them with the
[1:16:39] same amount of emotion
[1:16:41] both of them under the same anointing
[1:16:43] now again and there are false anointed
[1:16:46] ones and then there are just fakes
[1:16:49] right and we get a lot of that in
[1:16:51] Pentecost today scarecrows just fakes
[1:16:54] but there's a real anointing
[1:16:57] now
[1:16:59] does the gift point to Christ the word
[1:17:01] how do you tell a Ministry
[1:17:04] now it ought to be an anointed one a
[1:17:06] minister is an anointed one but if he's
[1:17:08] an anointed one what what is he pointing
[1:17:10] to
[1:17:11] is he pointing to himself is he pointing
[1:17:13] to a Doctrine is he pointing to some
[1:17:15] some thing that'll make him rich or
[1:17:17] something like that or is he pointing to
[1:17:19] Christ is he pointing to the word made
[1:17:22] flesh
[1:17:23] now watch
[1:17:25] if it points to Christ the word it's of
[1:17:27] God
[1:17:29] but Paul tells tells us and tells the
[1:17:32] early church he did not get them to
[1:17:33] Christ by word only
[1:17:35] Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[1:17:37] only but also in power in the holy God
[1:17:39] are you still okay tonight
[1:17:41] we're almost done well some of you are
[1:17:44] in much Assurance thank you brother
[1:17:45] David I'm just going to preach to you
[1:17:47] for a while
[1:17:48] he said in much assurance that you know
[1:17:50] what manner of men we were among you for
[1:17:52] your sake who and again in second
[1:17:54] Corinthians 3 6 he said who also hath
[1:17:56] made us Abel Ministers of the New
[1:17:58] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:18:00] spirit for the letter killeth but the
[1:18:01] spirit giveth life
[1:18:03] see the letter is not Christ the
[1:18:04] manifestation of the letter is Christ
[1:18:06] again they didn't go look for a book
[1:18:09] they went and saw a person
[1:18:12] and so let's bring it on down now we
[1:18:15] cannot get people back to the word
[1:18:16] without power being in the church
[1:18:19] we CA it's Inseparable you can't get
[1:18:22] people back to Christ the logos without
[1:18:25] there being a Christ there who does
[1:18:27] Miracles and signs and wonders and has
[1:18:30] uh joy in life there's no way you can do
[1:18:33] that
[1:18:35] are you hearing me now there's God it's
[1:18:37] it's got to go together
[1:18:38] we get the people to Christ the Messiah
[1:18:40] Now watch how do we do that by becoming
[1:18:43] anointed once
[1:18:45] that's what Peter did that's what made
[1:18:48] his message so powerful
[1:18:50] how did he get the people to Christ
[1:18:52] what's brother better saying he's
[1:18:53] telling us that we become the anointed
[1:18:56] ones we become the quickened ones we
[1:18:58] become alive
[1:19:00] and how did Peter get the people to
[1:19:02] Christ he said I'm afraid we're not
[1:19:03] getting them to Christ
[1:19:04] why because we're not becoming
[1:19:08] the word
[1:19:10] are you with me now we're not becoming
[1:19:12] the word we're not becoming well brother
[1:19:14] random calls Messiah ants or little
[1:19:17] Messiahs
[1:19:18] you can only reflect what you're
[1:19:20] pointing to
[1:19:22] now watch a messiah now what is that
[1:19:24] it's a Christ by measure we won't go all
[1:19:27] into that tonight as we hurry along to
[1:19:29] close but it's the same quality in a
[1:19:31] different quantity
[1:19:33] same quality that is in you is in Christ
[1:19:37] but a different quantity he was the
[1:19:39] fullness of the godhead
[1:19:40] then when God brother Brandon said was
[1:19:42] made flesh and become the Messiah
[1:19:44] then if we can yield ourselves
[1:19:47] there's the key yes
[1:19:49] huh
[1:19:51] Wednesday night and we're tired but if
[1:19:53] we can yield ourselves
[1:19:55] on Monday when you get up in the morning
[1:19:58] if you can yield yourself
[1:20:00] on Thursday whatever day that it is for
[1:20:02] the week when you get to school when you
[1:20:04] get to work can you yield yourself to
[1:20:06] becoming the Messiah
[1:20:08] the anointed one
[1:20:11] because your church needs the anointed
[1:20:13] one
[1:20:15] your your school needs the anointed one
[1:20:17] they don't need just the book
[1:20:19] they don't need just a tape yes that
[1:20:21] told who he was
[1:20:23] but they needed an anointed one
[1:20:25] Christ
[1:20:28] now watch
[1:20:29] he said then if we can yield ourselves
[1:20:31] to be the anointed like he was we become
[1:20:33] Messiahs little lights
[1:20:36] that's what the church is supposed to be
[1:20:39] amen lights little anointed ones that's
[1:20:44] God's Church
[1:20:45] you want to be God's Church there's lots
[1:20:47] of churches call themselves The Church
[1:20:49] of Christ or the Church of God but
[1:20:50] there's no anointed one there
[1:20:52] right and again it won't be a false
[1:20:55] anointed one now the Bible does tell us
[1:20:57] there'll be false Christ
[1:20:58] false Messiahs
[1:21:00] Matthew 24 24 there shall arise false
[1:21:03] Christ and false prophets
[1:21:05] and they'll show great signs and wonders
[1:21:07] and so much if it were possible they'll
[1:21:09] receive the very elect mother Brown said
[1:21:11] the anointed of the same water that
[1:21:12] watered the wheat also Waters the tears
[1:21:14] anointed once he said only the elected
[1:21:17] or predestinator will be able to detect
[1:21:19] the difference between them
[1:21:21] what is that you've got the word in you
[1:21:24] amen and you don't have to worry about
[1:21:26] that you don't have to well if we see
[1:21:28] any emotion we might be deceived how can
[1:21:30] you be deceived
[1:21:31] if we hear a preacher we might be
[1:21:33] deceived how can you be deceived you are
[1:21:35] the word
[1:21:37] the word is in you and it's not it's a
[1:21:39] mustard seed word it's a it's an
[1:21:41] undivided word it's an un it's a word
[1:21:44] that has never been mixed with anything
[1:21:46] else
[1:21:47] you are the word and so you you you're
[1:21:50] not going to be deceived
[1:21:52] the right seed is the word and that plus
[1:21:54] the anointing or the rain manifests the
[1:21:56] weed listen the false anointed ones are
[1:21:59] not false because they're anointed
[1:22:01] they're false because they will not stay
[1:22:03] with the word
[1:22:04] and because of that their fruits are
[1:22:06] wrong
[1:22:07] right and when it grows up he said let
[1:22:09] them grow up together but then in this
[1:22:11] age we see them putting on fruits and
[1:22:13] they come up and preach the same message
[1:22:14] preached the same way had the same
[1:22:16] anointing but when they come up the
[1:22:17] fruits were wrong
[1:22:19] they begin it's manifesting time how
[1:22:21] many believe that tonight we want our
[1:22:23] fruits to be right brother random called
[1:22:24] their fruit their Doctrine the fruit of
[1:22:26] a Preacher is his Doctrine
[1:22:27] right that's his that's his fruit it's
[1:22:29] what he produces we want to we want to
[1:22:32] produce the right thing don't win
[1:22:34] he said now we become Anointed with that
[1:22:36] same Spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs
[1:22:39] of the last day they shine forth the
[1:22:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ to show
[1:22:42] that he's not dead but in the form of
[1:22:44] the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving
[1:22:47] among his bride with the love affair to
[1:22:49] her pouring out into her himself
[1:22:55] they are becoming one for the wedding
[1:22:57] supper and the same signs promised by
[1:23:00] the same God in the same word is making
[1:23:03] his same manifestations
[1:23:05] so there's nothing left for us to do but
[1:23:07] believe it and believe it is a substance
[1:23:09] and that creates
[1:23:11] a perfect faith
[1:23:13] the false anointed ones could not become
[1:23:15] true anointed ones they were false at
[1:23:17] the bottom
[1:23:18] right false from the beginning
[1:23:20] and they were anointed on the outer
[1:23:21] realm and we've been through that they
[1:23:23] were not anointed from the soul but you
[1:23:25] got something inside of you if you're a
[1:23:26] seed of God here tonight and I trust
[1:23:28] that we all are we don't I don't know
[1:23:30] but you know
[1:23:31] you can know and you can have confidence
[1:23:34] in that and so you if you're a seed of
[1:23:36] God what happens there's something
[1:23:38] inside of you that is the word and when
[1:23:41] the word falls on it it can't do nothing
[1:23:42] but manifest the weed
[1:23:44] oh my and this message is that love
[1:23:47] affair of God he's pouring himself into
[1:23:49] US pouring himself in what does that
[1:23:51] produce manifestation
[1:23:54] what does it manifest the same life that
[1:23:57] Christ had
[1:23:59] how did Peter get them to Christ
[1:24:01] he got them to the Holy Ghost
[1:24:04] how how do we get people this message
[1:24:07] we get them to Christ the word the Holy
[1:24:10] Ghost
[1:24:11] the token
[1:24:12] with me I'm not saying there's no place
[1:24:14] for teaching but we need a god with skin
[1:24:16] on it
[1:24:18] somebody that manifests the word
[1:24:20] manifest the gifts isn't that what you
[1:24:22] want to do musicians go ahead and come
[1:24:23] tonight closing manifest the gifts of
[1:24:25] the Spirit
[1:24:26] but you don't stop there you manifest
[1:24:29] the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:24:31] are you with me now because that's what
[1:24:33] he did he didn't just go about healing
[1:24:36] the sick but he also went about with
[1:24:37] love and compassion and long-suffering
[1:24:40] saying father forgive them they don't
[1:24:42] even know what they're doing
[1:24:43] it didn't he manifest that in his life
[1:24:45] that's what we're supposed to manifest
[1:24:48] right and so we manifest the gifts of
[1:24:51] the Spirit the fruit of the spirit and
[1:24:52] we live a life worthy of the Gospel
[1:24:55] we live a life above the things of the
[1:24:57] world why do we do that because the
[1:24:59] spirit of Jesus dwells in you and if the
[1:25:01] spirit of him that raised up Christ from
[1:25:03] the dead dwell in you it'll also Quicken
[1:25:05] this Mortal body

[1:25:31] some of it sticks
[1:25:33] we still live in bodies of Flesh that's
[1:25:35] the sticky nature on the outside but
[1:25:37] inside of that there's a germ of life
[1:25:41] it's not so much about what happens on
[1:25:43] the outside but eventually what happens
[1:25:45] on the outside will reflect what's
[1:25:47] happening on the inside we want to be
[1:25:50] Messiah it's anointed ones
[1:25:52] not to look down on or say well though
[1:25:55] that they have a bunch of emotions so
[1:25:57] they must be false that's not what it's
[1:25:58] about
[1:25:59] but it's about the life
[1:26:02] it's about the life what is the fruit
[1:26:04] show
