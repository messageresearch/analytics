[18:55] privilege we have to be in your house
[18:57] tonight. Lord, we just ask you to come
[18:59] down in this place in a special way.
[19:02] Lord,

[19:05] Father, but numbers don't count. Father,
[19:08] we know you said in your word that if

[19:13] Lord. Father, we just pray that you

[20:11] I mean, you could be seated.
[20:14] There are two roads
[20:19] you may take.
[20:21] [Music]
[20:23] One by side
[20:27] and one by faith.
[20:31] Just take the word of God.
[20:35] What you see,
[20:39] what you believe
[20:43] is what will be.
[20:47] So set your wings
[20:51] to the winds of faith
[20:55] and you can fly
[20:59] in a higher place.
[21:04] Do not struggle.
[21:08] It's by grace.
[21:12] Set your wings
[21:15] to the wind of faith.
[21:19] Oh, watch your knee
[21:24] and watch your cry.
[21:28] Watch your mountain.
[21:32] touch too high.
[21:35] Just speak the word of God
[21:40] and by and by
[21:43] oh it will move
[21:47] or you will fly.
[21:51] So send your wings
[21:55] to the wings of faith.
[22:00] You can fly
[22:04] in a higher place
[22:08] and do not struggle.
[22:12] It's by grace.
[22:16] Set your wings
[22:19] to the wind of faith
[22:24] and watch the eagle
[22:28] up in the sky.
[22:32] He does not struggle.
[22:36] He does not strive.
[22:40] Oh, for the power
[22:44] that makes him rise.
[22:47] Oh, it's already
[22:50] [Music]
[22:52] in the skies.
[22:56] So send your wings
[23:00] to the winds of faith
[23:04] and you can fly
[23:08] in a higher place
[23:12] and do not struggle.
[23:16] It's by grace.
[23:20] Set your wings
[23:24] to the wind. One more time with all your
[23:27] hearts now. Oh, send your wings
[23:32] to the wind of faith.
[23:36] And you can fly
[23:40] in a higher place.
[23:44] and do not struggle.
[23:48] It's by grace
[23:52] set your wings.
[23:55] One more time as sister Nolan comes with
[23:57] her song. Oh, so set your wings
[24:04] to the winds of faith
[24:08] and you can fly
[24:12] in a higher place.
[24:16] And do not struggle.
[24:20] It's by grace.
[24:25] your wings
[24:28] to the wind
[24:30] of faith. If that's what you're going to
[24:32] do tonight, would you give the Lord a
[24:33] big hand clap of praise?
[24:35] [Applause]
[24:55] [Music]
[25:09] I look back
[25:12] on history,
[25:15] see the mighty God
[25:18] unveiled,
[25:21] proving
[25:23] over and over
[25:26] that his word
[25:29] can never fail.
[25:32] But I can't
[25:35] keep on dwelling
[25:38] on some past memory
[25:43] cuz he's the same God
[25:46] who's living
[25:49] in me.
[25:51] [Music]
[25:55] The same God
[25:58] who spoke to
[26:00] the woman at
[26:03] the well.
[26:06] The same God
[26:09] whose wonders
[26:11] too many
[26:14] to tell.
[26:17] The same God
[26:20] who parted
[26:22] the raging
[26:25] red.
[26:30] He's the same God
[26:33] who's living
[26:36] in me.
[26:38] [Music]
[26:42] The same God
[26:44] who created
[26:47] all the heavens and all the earth
[26:53] came back living in Jesus.
[26:58] There was power
[27:00] in his word.
[27:03] But now in
[27:06] these last days,
[27:08] I'm beginning
[27:11] to see
[27:13] that he's the same God
[27:17] who's living
[27:19] in me.
[27:22] [Music]
[27:25] The same God
[27:28] who spoke to
[27:30] the woman at
[27:33] the well.
[27:36] The same God
[27:39] whose wonders
[27:41] too many
[27:44] to tell.
[27:47] The same God
[27:49] who broughten
[27:52] the raging
[27:55] sea.
[28:00] He's the same God
[28:03] who's living
[28:05] in me.
[28:11] He's the same God
[28:14] who's living
[28:16] in me.
[28:20] [Music]
[28:22] [Applause]
[28:28] You believe that tonight? Amen. He's the
[28:31] same God. Amen. If we really know that
[28:33] that he's right here among us tonight,
[28:35] then all things are possible. If the
[28:37] same God that did all those things is
[28:38] here. Amen. Let's let's try this one in
[28:41] the key of G. Sister Anna.
[28:44] Let's stand and try to sing it. You
[28:46] sound better when you stand it. And
[28:47] those of you that can. The Lord has
[28:50] brought me through all of my trials.
[28:56] And when I had failed him,
[29:00] he didn't cast me away.
[29:03] Well, he stood right by me
[29:07] through all of my troules.
[29:11] And when I was lost, he didn't let me go
[29:16] astray.
[29:18] Well, he took my sins
[29:22] and he saved my soul.
[29:26] He cleaned me up
[29:30] and he made me whole.
[29:33] Oh, Jesus died on Calvary
[29:38] so the whole wide world would see. It
[29:42] was a great thing
[29:45] that he did for me.
[29:48] Oh, it was a great thing
[29:52] that he did for me. Yes, it was.
[29:56] Oh, it was a great thing
[30:00] when he set me free.
[30:04] Oh, Jesus died on Calvary
[30:08] so the whole wide world could see. It
[30:12] was a great thing
[30:15] that he did for me. I like this one.
[30:19] Well, he's been my doctor
[30:23] and he's been my lawyer.
[30:27] He never left me.
[30:31] He's been my friend.
[30:34] He's been my comforter.
[30:38] When I was lonely
[30:42] and when I was lost, you know, Jesus
[30:46] took me in.
[30:50] Well, he took my sins
[30:53] and saved my soul.
[30:57] He cleaned me up
[31:01] and he made me whole.
[31:04] Oh, Jesus died on Calary
[31:09] so the whole wide world could see. It
[31:13] was a great thing
[31:16] that he did for me. with all your hearts
[31:19] now. Well, it was a great thing
[31:24] that he did for me. Oh, yes it was. Oh,
[31:28] it was a great thing
[31:31] when he set me free.
[31:35] Oh, Jesus died on Calvary
[31:40] so the whole wide world could see. It
[31:44] was a great thing
[31:47] that he did for me. One more time. Oh,
[31:51] it was a great thing that he did for me.
[31:58] Oh, it was a great thing
[32:02] when he set me free. How many's free
[32:04] here tonight? Oh, Jesus died on Calvary
[32:10] so the whole wide world could see. It
[32:14] was a great thing that he did. Oh,
[32:18] you're sounding good. Sing it one more
[32:20] time. Well, it was a great thing that he
[32:25] did for me and you.
[32:28] Oh, it was a great thing when he set me
[32:34] free.
[32:36] Oh, Jesus died on Calvary
[32:41] so the whole wide world could see. It
[32:45] was a great thing
[32:48] that he did for me.
[32:52] Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise.
[32:55] When you think of the goodness of Jesus,
[32:57] you can't help but give him praise, can
[32:58] you? Amen. Aren't you thankful for the
[33:00] word of the Lord? Are you ready for the
[33:01] word of the Lord tonight? Amen. And I
[33:03] tell you, the pastor's been doing such a
[33:05] wonderful job and and I believe he'll
[33:07] just continue right on if we'll just
[33:08] keep pulling on the gift that God has
[33:09] placed here among us. Amen. I believe
[33:12] that uh I believe that what he had on
[33:14] has on his heart tonight will be
[33:15] specifically for somebody in this
[33:17] building and maybe just for every one of
[33:19] us. And so just take what the Lord gives
[33:21] you tonight and and I really believe
[33:23] you'll be blessed. I believe we come one
[33:25] way, we want to leave better. We we're
[33:27] going to leave better or worse. We might
[33:28] as well leave better Christians. How
[33:29] about y'all tonight? Give the Lord
[33:31] another big hand clap of praise tonight.
[33:33] if you would. And as we invite our
[33:35] pastor, we're going to go old school
[33:37] here and see if we can try this song. On
[33:40] the wings of a snow
[33:44] white
[33:46] dove,
[33:47] God sends his pure,
[33:51] sweet
[33:53] love, a sign from above.
[34:01] On the wings of a dove. Sing the chorus
[34:04] again now.
[34:07] Oh, on the wings of a snow
[34:11] white
[34:13] dove.
[34:15] God sends his pure
[34:18] sweet
[34:20] love. A sign from above.
[34:28] on the wings of a dove. Let's try a
[34:31] verse of that now.
[34:34] Oh, Noah had drifted
[34:41] on the floods many days.
[34:47] He searched for landing
[34:54] in various ways.
[35:00] Oh troubles he had
[35:04] some
[35:07] but not from above.
[35:13] And God gave him his high
[35:20] on the wings of a dove. With all your
[35:24] hearts now.
[35:26] Oh, on the wings of a snow
[35:30] white
[35:32] dove,
[35:34] God sends his pure
[35:37] sweet
[35:38] love, a sign from above
[35:46] on the wings of a dove. We try that
[35:49] second verse now.
[35:52] Well, Jesus our savior,
[35:56] [Music]
[35:59] he came to earth one day.
[36:05] He was born in a stable
[36:12] in a manger of pain.
[36:15] [Music]
[36:18] And though he rejected,
[36:21] [Music]
[36:24] but not from above
[36:28] [Music]
[36:30] and God gave us his son
[36:37] on the wings of a dove. Aren't you
[36:40] thankful for tonight? Can you just sing
[36:42] it now? Oh, on the wings of a snow.
[36:47] wind up.
[36:50] God sends his pure
[36:54] sweet
[36:55] love a sign from above
[37:02] on the wings of a dove. Let's sing that
[37:05] last verse.
[37:09] And though I have suffered
[37:15] in many of ways,
[37:21] oh I cry for healing
[37:28] both night and day. Have you ever been
[37:32] there?
[37:33] Oh, but faith wasn't forgotten.
[37:39] Hallelujah. By the father above.
[37:45] Thank you, Lord. Oh, he gave me his son.
[37:53] Oh, on the wings of a dove.
[37:58] Sing it down. Oh, on the wings of a snow
[38:03] white.
[38:06] Oh, God sensed his pure
[38:10] sweet love a sign from above.
[38:18] Oh, on the wings of a dove. Sing that
[38:21] chorus again. Singing it so well
[38:23] tonight. Oh, on the wings of a snow.
[38:31] Oh, God sends his piercings
[38:37] up a sign from above.
[38:44] On the wings of a dove.
[38:48] Amen. You believe that dove's here
[38:51] tonight? That dove is the Holy Spirit
[38:54] right here among us. Amen. Where he said
[38:56] he'd never leave us, never forsake us.
[38:58] So grateful for that tonight. Let's bow
[39:00] our heads together. So you play that. I
[39:03] wonder if there's maybe a someone that
[39:04] would have a need on their heart. Just
[39:06] be something you just between you and
[39:08] the Lord. Say, Lord, I need you to meet
[39:10] that tonight. I believe you can do that.
[39:12] Heavenly Father, I pray that you bless
[39:14] these hands that were raised. Lord, all
[39:17] of us, Lord, have things that we need to
[39:19] see done in our lives. and we believe
[39:21] you're still a miracle working God. So
[39:24] we pray, God, that you would just move
[39:26] today. And Lord, speak through me, Lord.
[39:29] We know that a a word fitly spoken in
[39:32] due season is is is precious to us,
[39:35] Lord. And I pray that you'd help your
[39:37] word to be precious to us tonight. And
[39:39] to do that, Lord, I have to move myself
[39:41] out of the way, Lord, and minimize the
[39:44] humanity, Lord. May you shine yourself
[39:47] through, Lord, and speak what you would
[39:49] have to say. Pray you'd forgive me of
[39:51] every fault, Lord, and the people as
[39:53] well. We We just want to be washed by
[39:55] the water of the word tonight. We thank
[39:57] you for all that you do in Jesus name.
[40:00] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. Amen.
[40:04] Isn't that wonderful? I just love that
[40:06] old song, Psalms chapter 42 and verse
[40:08] one.
[40:10] Brother Peter and I were practicing that
[40:13] before church. and uh uh he uh actually
[40:17] we the original song is a little faster
[40:20] and we went and got the original time
[40:22] and stuff on it. I really enjoyed that
[40:24] and I thought it was neat that brother
[40:25] Joel sang it. We come out Psalm chapter
[40:28] 42 and verse one. As the heart panth
[40:32] after the waterbrooks,
[40:34] so panth my soul after thee, oh God, my
[40:40] soul thirsteth for God, for the living
[40:43] God. When shall I come and appear before
[40:48] God? Pray the Lord would add his
[40:50] blessing to the word. You may be seated
[40:53] this evening. I want to speak to you
[40:55] tonight on living between two desires.
[40:58] living between two desires. This struck
[41:02] my attention. I actually picked a tape
[41:04] to listen to called Thirst just randomly
[41:07] just to listen to for my own edification
[41:09] this week and and it really struck me
[41:12] and and God I believe showed me these
[41:14] things and and it's just things that the
[41:16] prophet said, but I believe it'll help
[41:18] us tonight. It helped me and I trust
[41:20] it'll be a help to you as well. Brother
[41:22] Brandham taught us that the word thirst
[41:24] means a painful desire. a painful
[41:28] desire. So, it's not just something you
[41:30] think you want, but it's something you
[41:32] have to have. And and you get to where
[41:35] you have to have water, and that's what
[41:37] thirst is. And so, there's a desire of
[41:40] the flesh and a desire of the spirit.
[41:43] Brother Brandham calls it two control
[41:45] towers. So there's uh control tower
[41:48] something that controls something that
[41:49] causes you to desire the flesh and
[41:53] something else that causes you to desire
[41:55] the spirit. Brother Brandham says for
[41:57] instance the flesh thirsts to satisfy
[42:00] the desires that's in the body and the
[42:02] spirit desires for the things that's in
[42:04] the soul desire. He said and many times
[42:07] these war one against the other. So so
[42:12] he said we find there's a great trouble.
[42:15] He said today that too many people try
[42:18] to live and this is very important
[42:20] tonight. This what we want to talk
[42:22] about. He said too many people try to
[42:24] live between those two desires. Right?
[42:28] So they don't know they they haven't
[42:29] surrendered to either one and and the
[42:32] desire of the flesh is pulling this way
[42:34] and the desire of the spirit is pulling
[42:37] that way and they're trying to live in
[42:39] between those two desires. He said, "For
[42:42] one of them desires the things of the
[42:44] earth, but the other desires the things
[42:48] of heaven." Now, we know that we were
[42:50] born with a thirst to fellowship with
[42:51] God. And actually, that thirst is also
[42:54] common among humanity. That's not just
[42:58] something that uh that desire to
[43:00] fellowship with God is not just in the
[43:02] elect. In fact, that's that desire is in
[43:05] all humanity. You find that even the
[43:08] Indians worshiped a great spirit and uh
[43:10] all over the world they worshiped
[43:12] something. So that's not just the elect,
[43:14] that's man made in the image of God were
[43:16] made to worship something and they will
[43:19] worship something and man still will
[43:21] worship something. But you were born
[43:24] with that thirst. Now what the what's
[43:26] different about the elect is that the
[43:28] elect there's something about them that
[43:30] it becomes painful. It becomes something
[43:33] they have to have. They can't be like
[43:34] Esau and take it or leave it. But it's
[43:37] got to be something like Jacob that
[43:39] that's the difference. He had to have
[43:40] it. He He had to have the birthright. He
[43:42] had to have uh he had to have the
[43:44] blessing. And so it become a painful
[43:47] desire. And yet men, you were born with
[43:49] a desire to worship God as a human
[43:51] being. And and brother Brandham said he
[43:53] realized he was talking to the doctor at
[43:56] Mayo Clinic. And and he said that he
[43:58] realized when he was talking to him, he
[44:00] said he said, "My daddy was a drunk."
[44:02] And he said, "What what makes a man do
[44:04] that?" And the the doctor told him, he
[44:06] said, "Well," he said, "It's something
[44:08] he's not satisfied with in his life."
[44:10] And because he's not satisfied, he goes
[44:13] out and drinks. And some of you that
[44:15] were involved in in drugs or alcohol,
[44:17] you know that that's true. There's
[44:18] something in your life you were longing
[44:20] for. Uh pornography or whatever it might
[44:22] be or or or or adultery, there's
[44:25] something that's not filled. And so,
[44:27] you're trying to fill that that empty
[44:29] spot with something. And again, that's a
[44:31] that's universal among human beings that
[44:34] they're trying to do that. And brother
[44:35] Brandon said when he said that, he said,
[44:36] "I realize that he said, 'What my dad
[44:38] was hungry for, he was thirsty for was
[44:41] actually God." And and that's the only
[44:43] thing that can fill it because the drugs
[44:45] have an end. And you got to have
[44:47] stronger and stronger and stronger ones.
[44:49] And alcohol has an end. You got to have
[44:51] more and more and more alcohol. But but
[44:54] but Christ is eternal. And there's
[44:56] something about the word that gives you
[44:59] uh that fulfills the desire of your
[45:00] heart. Something about the the spirit of
[45:03] God when you when you're in the presence
[45:04] of God, it just makes you happy. It
[45:07] makes you satisfied to be a Christian
[45:09] and satisfied to live for. I wonder if
[45:11] there's anybody here tonight that's
[45:12] satisfied to be a believer. That's the
[45:14] way I want to be every moment of the
[45:16] day. Yes, sir.
[45:18] So when you try to satisfy your thirst
[45:23] for fellowship with God, when you start
[45:25] to do that, you know, Satan just don't
[45:28] roll over. He sees what you're doing. He
[45:31] can't read your mind. But when you begin
[45:33] to do things, he sees that. And so what
[45:36] does he do? He puts obstacles in your
[45:38] way. He puts up obstacles to that. And
[45:42] and and brother Brandham relates that to
[45:43] Romans 7:21. And he said, "I find then a
[45:45] law that when I would do good, evil is
[45:49] present with me." So anytime I want to
[45:52] do good, any time I want to do what's
[45:54] right, e, evil is present with me. And
[45:57] so, Brother Brandham said, when you try,
[45:58] he said, did you ever have that in your
[46:01] inexperience Christians, he said that
[46:03] when you're trying to do something
[46:05] that's worthwhile, go to make an effort
[46:07] to do something that's good. He said
[46:10] then you find out there is the devil on
[46:12] every hand just to upset you everything
[46:15] that you So you'll find that you know I
[46:18] I found just in anecdotal evidence I
[46:20] found as a pastor over the years and
[46:23] working with people over over many years
[46:25] I found that uh that people will will uh
[46:28] they'll they'll start to come to church
[46:30] and just as soon as they start to come
[46:32] their job will start wanting them to
[46:33] come in on Sundays or or or there'll be
[46:36] trouble in the home and they'll start
[46:37] fussing and fighting with one another or
[46:39] there'll be trouble with their children
[46:41] or something will happen to try to keep
[46:42] them out of the house of God or or maybe
[46:44] they'll they'll make a commitment and
[46:46] brother Brandon's not talking to sinners
[46:47] here but Christians you'll make a
[46:49] commitment to read your Bible more to
[46:51] pray more or or to do things in a better
[46:53] way as a Christian that you know you
[46:55] ought to do and I've done that many
[46:57] times and immediately there'll be an
[46:59] obstacle you'll get a phone call you'll
[47:01] something will happen you sit down and
[47:02] try to listen to a tape and something
[47:04] will happen to distract you every time
[47:06] it's going to happen that way He said,
[47:08] "When you're trying to do something
[47:09] that's worthwhile, go to make an effort
[47:11] to do something that's good. You find
[47:13] out there is the devil on every hand
[47:16] just to upset you. Just that's all
[47:19] that's his job is to upset you. But when
[47:21] you recognize him, brother said to
[47:23] overcome is to recognize the devil at
[47:25] every one of his tricks." And this is
[47:28] one of his tricks. As soon as he sees
[47:30] you begin to do something for God, he's
[47:32] going to do everything he can to prevent
[47:34] that and put an obstacle in your way. He
[47:37] he said now uh he said now many times I
[47:40] meet people that's prone to be a little
[47:43] nervous when they find out that they're
[47:45] trying to do something and everything is
[47:48] just blocking it off on both sides and
[47:51] they say it might not have been the will
[47:53] of the Lord. See, he said now don't let
[47:56] the devil lie to you like that.
[47:59] Right? It was the will of the Lord till
[48:00] it got difficult.
[48:03] It was the will of the Lord till it be
[48:05] till till you know your finances got
[48:07] messed up or or or somebody got sick or
[48:11] something else. It was the will of the
[48:12] Lord until something bad happened. If it
[48:15] was ever the will of the Lord, it's
[48:17] still the will of the Lord,
[48:20] right? A and we've got to hold on to
[48:22] that because of course Satan's going to
[48:24] try to make you think it's not if it is.
[48:27] So we don't go by, you know, just well
[48:30] an obstacle came up. It must not be the
[48:31] will of the Lord. But the Brown said
[48:33] people get nervous and they think that.
[48:35] He said the first thing is to find out.
[48:37] He said whether it's the will of God or
[48:39] not. Right? It either is or it isn't.
[48:42] And if it is the will of God, you don't
[48:44] know whether it's the will of God by how
[48:46] difficult it is. You don't know whether
[48:49] it's the will of God by by by how much
[48:51] obstacles come in your way, right? You
[48:53] don't know whether it's the will of God
[48:55] by how much the devil fights you, but
[48:57] you know whether it's the will of God.
[48:59] You look in the Bible, right, and see
[49:02] whether it's the will of God, and it's
[49:04] just like, you know, for me, I don't
[49:06] have to have God doesn't have to give me
[49:09] a revelation every time before I come
[49:12] out and preach that I should preach,
[49:16] right? It's the will of God for me to
[49:18] preach because it's the word of God and
[49:21] God anointed me to do it and he gave me
[49:23] the ability to do it and then it's in
[49:24] his word. So I don't have to get a new
[49:26] revelation and and a new calling and and
[49:28] him come down and strike me over the
[49:30] head or strike me with lightning or
[49:32] something and say go preach the gospel.
[49:33] No, it's the will of God for me to
[49:35] preach the gospel. So if I that way if I
[49:38] get, you know, because anytime I go to
[49:39] preach, something's going to happen,
[49:41] right? Anytime you go to do something
[49:42] for God, you could you could be on
[49:44] vacation for four weeks and nothing bad
[49:47] would happen. But as soon as you go to
[49:48] do something for God, something's going
[49:50] to happen to try to prevent you from
[49:52] doing that. And so what you have to do
[49:54] is learn to push through that and
[49:56] overcome that. How you going to do that?
[49:58] You look in the Bible. Is it the will of
[49:59] God? Is it the will of God for you to be
[50:01] in church? I think the answer to that
[50:03] ought to be that's a yes or no question,
[50:05] right? It either is or it isn't. Now,
[50:08] which particular church, that's up to
[50:09] you. And but you need to find the will
[50:11] of God for that. But it is the will of
[50:13] God to be in church. So if you start out
[50:15] for church and every time you start out
[50:17] for church, you your vehicle breaks down
[50:19] or or the kids get upset or something
[50:21] happens, you might get discouraged and
[50:23] think, well, every time I go to the
[50:24] house of God, it must not be the will of
[50:26] God for me to go to church. It is the
[50:27] will of God because it's the word of
[50:30] God, right? So we don't have to wonder
[50:32] whether it's the will of God or not
[50:34] because we've looked in the scripture
[50:35] and seen that it is the will of God. I'm
[50:38] so thankful that we got something more
[50:40] solid than just uh maybe so or or we're
[50:43] we're waiting for somebody to prophesy
[50:45] over us or something like that. That's
[50:47] Pentecostal in its nature. It's the way
[50:48] they did things. But that's not the way
[50:50] we ought to do things. We look at the
[50:52] word of God and see whether or not it's
[50:54] the will of God. So he said, he said,
[50:56] "Don't let the devil lie to you like
[50:58] that." The first thing is he said, "Find
[51:00] out whether it's the will of God or
[51:01] not." He said, "And then if you want to
[51:03] know whether it's the will of God, look
[51:06] into the Bible." He said there is the
[51:08] thing that sets you straight is the word
[51:11] of God. Not your circumstances, not how
[51:13] you feel, not how I feel, not somebody's
[51:16] opinion, not somebody say, "Well, you
[51:19] know what does he think? What do they
[51:20] think? What does the Bible say about
[51:22] it?" And if it's a Bible thing to do, we
[51:25] know it's the will of God. Now, it's not
[51:26] the will of God for everybody to preach,
[51:28] but if it's if it's a Bible thing to do
[51:31] and then God has anointed me to do it,
[51:33] then I ought to go do it, right? And so
[51:36] if God's given you the ability to sing
[51:38] or he's given you the ability to help
[51:39] out in the church, you ought to go do
[51:41] that. It's if if it's the if it's right
[51:43] in the word and you have the ability to
[51:45] do it, you ought to go do that and and
[51:47] do something for the Lord because we
[51:50] know that it's that must be the will of
[51:51] God whether you have obstacles or not.
[51:53] Now, are you with me so far?
[51:56] And then in that then you have to
[51:58] discern the will of God between because
[52:00] not everybody's going to preach the
[52:01] same. Not everybody's going to go to the
[52:03] same church.
[52:04] You got to discern the will of God for
[52:05] that. But it is the will of God for you
[52:06] to be in church. It is the will of God
[52:09] for preachers to preach,
[52:11] right? It is the will of God for people
[52:14] to live for the Lord, say, "Well, I've
[52:17] been made fun of since I started looking
[52:18] like a Christian. It must not be the
[52:20] will of the Lord." No, it is the will of
[52:21] God for you to look like a Christian,
[52:23] dress like a Christian, act like a
[52:25] Christian, right? And and some of you
[52:27] young people, you benefit from this. You
[52:29] know, you you come against an obstacle.
[52:31] And I see so many young people are so
[52:33] fickle in these things and and and we
[52:35] all were when we were young. But you
[52:37] know, you'll come up against an obstacle
[52:38] in a relationship or and you say, "Well,
[52:41] it must not be the will of God." No.
[52:42] First thing you need to do is find out
[52:44] whether it's right with the word. Right?
[52:46] It's not God's will for you if you're a
[52:48] boy to be married to another man.
[52:52] Right? It's not the will of God for you
[52:54] if you're a girl to be married to a
[52:56] girl. But it is the will of God perhaps
[52:58] for you to be married. Not for
[53:00] everybody. Well, there's a revelation.
[53:03] Not everybody's meant to be married. But
[53:05] but yet at the same time, it is the will
[53:07] of God for you to get married for most
[53:09] people to get married. Then if it's the
[53:10] will of God for you to get married, then
[53:12] you got to find out whether it's the
[53:14] will of God for you to marry that
[53:15] person. But don't look at the obstacles
[53:17] to it because sometimes you get
[53:18] discouraged with one another. You know,
[53:20] just because you're if you're married,
[53:22] if you're newly married, you say, "Well,
[53:23] we must have missed the will of God if
[53:24] we're fighting, if we're fussing."
[53:26] That's not the case at all. You you need
[53:28] to recognize the devil's going to fight
[53:29] you. He's fought every married couple
[53:32] here. He's fought every every couple's
[53:34] been married. Some of y'all been married
[53:35] 50, 60 years, and you know that the the
[53:37] devil's fought you every step of the
[53:39] way, but you know it was the will of God
[53:41] for you to be together. And so you once
[53:43] you get a revelation of that will,
[53:45] nothing can shake you. Are you with me
[53:47] now? It's not the will of God for you to
[53:49] be married to anybody. But now, if
[53:51] you're married to somebody now, that's
[53:53] the will of God for your life. And you
[53:56] ought to stay married to that person.
[53:59] Are you with me?
[54:01] Now, brother Brandon said, "Look in the
[54:03] Bible. There's the thing set you
[54:04] straight is the word of God. Then if you
[54:05] see it's in the word of God for you to
[54:07] do it, and and I'm not going to take all
[54:09] night tonight, but I'm just going to
[54:10] take enough time to to get to this." So,
[54:13] you just bear with me. If you're living
[54:15] between those two desires, trying to
[54:17] satisfy both, you'll get discouraged,
[54:22] right? you'll get discouraged. Brother
[54:25] Brandham talked about going to Africa
[54:27] and uses this in the illustration in the
[54:28] message thirst that when he went to
[54:31] Africa, he said he thought for years
[54:33] that the people didn't want him in
[54:34] Africa because that's what the the a
[54:37] certain preacher had told him. We don't
[54:40] want you here anymore. He said, "I went
[54:42] to Africa." He went in 1965 and when he
[54:45] went in 1965, he went as a hunter. You
[54:47] remember he didn't go and have meetings.
[54:49] when he went in 1965, he he went and he
[54:52] said, "I found out it was just that man
[54:53] and his family that didn't want me
[54:56] there. Everybody else wanted me to be
[54:58] there, but it hindered Brother Brandham
[55:00] from going back." But once he recognized
[55:02] that, see, if there's there was an
[55:04] obstacle in the way, but the message
[55:06] still had to get into Africa, right? And
[55:09] so, it was the will of God to go. Now,
[55:11] it was I I think of I had a missionary
[55:14] brother call me the other day. I won't
[55:15] say his name because it's a just in case
[55:18] I guess somebody might be listening I
[55:20] from the government of this certain
[55:21] country and and uh he told me that uh he
[55:24] was at a certain in a certain country a
[55:26] Muslim country and uh they arrested him
[55:29] at they found he had books with him he
[55:31] was carrying books I've done that myself
[55:32] I've carried illegal contra we did it
[55:35] brother Joel we did it into a certain
[55:36] country and and uh we went in carrying
[55:38] illegal contraband into that I mean if
[55:40] they find it in some countries they'll
[55:42] just toss it in other countries they'll
[55:44] actually arrest you. Well, this was a
[55:46] country where they actually arrested the
[55:47] brother and and they arrested him and
[55:50] and and and they're talking to him.
[55:52] They're they're giving him an
[55:53] interrogation and they're going to send
[55:54] him back home. They're going to deport
[55:55] him because that was the policy of the
[55:56] country. So, he's telling me that and
[55:58] and and and while they're doing that, he
[56:01] said, "Lord, if it's your will for me to
[56:02] be here, make a way for me to be here."
[56:04] You know, and but yet there was this
[56:06] obstacle in the way. And so many of us,
[56:07] that's where we get discouraged right
[56:09] there. But if you get discouraged like
[56:11] that in missionary work, I found that
[56:13] there's so many obstacles to you being
[56:15] that far overseas and preaching in those
[56:18] countries, there's so many hardships in
[56:20] doing that if you let things discourage
[56:22] you the way people let themselves be
[56:24] discouraged from coming to church or
[56:25] from serving God, you'd never do
[56:27] anything. But you just got to go forward
[56:30] and say, "God, I believe you. You you
[56:31] wanted me to do it. I felt it." Brother
[56:33] Brandon said, "You're always in the will
[56:34] of God doing missionary work. So the
[56:36] brother said, "Well, there must be a way
[56:38] to go to do it." And so he's sitting
[56:39] there about to he's already been
[56:41] arrested. He's he's ready to go. And
[56:42] there's a terrorist attack in that town
[56:45] where he's at. And and and and when he
[56:48] when there is all the security forces
[56:50] rush out outside of the airport. It's
[56:52] right down the street. They go out the
[56:53] airport. They leave him in an empty room
[56:55] with his passport laying on the table
[56:58] that they had taken from him and his
[57:00] luggage. And he's sitting there and he'd
[57:02] been praying the Lord would make a way.
[57:03] And he looks he said, "The door's open.
[57:05] My passport's laying there. Here's the
[57:07] luggage. Now, he didn't know what they
[57:09] do to him, right? When he walked out the
[57:11] door, they might have shot him. But he
[57:13] said, "Lord, I'm won't go." So, what
[57:15] does he do? He picks up his passport,
[57:17] picks up his luggage, and walks out the
[57:18] door and has a meeting, right? Has the
[57:21] meeting and continues on his missionary
[57:22] work and goes home two week two weeks
[57:24] later. They never say anything more to
[57:25] him. Why? Because he didn't let the
[57:27] obstacle stop him from doing the will of
[57:30] God, right? He he he'd surrendered to
[57:32] the desire to do God's will. Oh, that's
[57:35] what all of us need to do tonight. We
[57:37] don't need to live between two desires.
[57:39] We need to surrender to the desire on
[57:41] the inside that controlled tower that
[57:44] causes us to do the will of God.
[57:49] Brother Brand said, "You let a young
[57:50] convert come tonight to the altar
[57:51] somewhere here in this tabernacle or out
[57:53] across the nation and just remember
[57:55] tomorrow mother will be upset, more
[57:58] angry than she ever was. Dad will be all
[58:02] upset and all the school kids." Yes. He
[58:06] said, "And everything just goes wrong
[58:09] because it's Satan trying to get you to
[58:11] turn around." Yeah. Come on. Right. And
[58:15] that's where so many get discouraged.
[58:16] How many people do we have come in,
[58:17] young people and young couples, and
[58:19] people will come in and then there'll be
[58:22] obstacles and they'll start staying home
[58:23] because, you know, it's just too hard.
[58:26] But, but you got to overcome that. Come
[58:28] on. Right. God allowed that to be put in
[58:30] your way to see who you are because
[58:33] that's the difference in the elect and
[58:34] the non-elect is the elect somehow
[58:36] they're going to overcome that and
[58:38] they're going to make it. So, you know,
[58:41] and and maybe the devil would keep you
[58:43] out of church one time or he keep you
[58:44] out of doing what should have been done
[58:47] uh you know in in support of the people
[58:49] of God one time, but once you learn his
[58:51] trick, you don't fall to it again,
[58:54] right? You you repent. Say, "Lord, I'm
[58:56] sorry. I didn't mean I didn't mean to do
[58:57] that but you won't do it to me again
[58:59] right you learn from that and so all of
[59:01] us do that we c we allow things to keep
[59:04] us from doing the will of God but we got
[59:06] to learn from that and not let not fall
[59:08] to that again now the children of e of
[59:10] Israel rather were happy to come out of
[59:13] Egypt he said but they still had Egypt
[59:17] in them how many you've heard that
[59:19] statement before they were happy to come
[59:21] out they were excited the Bible said
[59:23] they come out with a strong hand but But
[59:25] they still had Egypt in them. Right.
[59:28] Right. So they were living between two
[59:30] desires
[59:32] when they come out of Egypt. Right. A
[59:34] desire to be free and a desire to be
[59:37] safe. Yeah. Come on. Right. So a fleshly
[59:41] desire and a spiritual desire. Exodus
[59:43] chapter 13 tells us a story. It says in
[59:46] verse 17, "It came to pass when Pharaoh
[59:48] had let the people go that God led them
[59:50] not through the way of the land of the
[59:51] Philistines, although that was near."
[59:55] Right? So they come out of Egypt and go
[59:57] the wrong direction.
[59:59] But it says, "Lest pure adventure of the
[1:00:01] people repent when they see war and they
[1:00:04] return to Egypt." So God knows that they
[1:00:06] wouldn't be able to go the close route.
[1:00:08] So he takes them the the route with
[1:00:11] obstacles, the route with no road,
[1:00:15] the route with no exit,
[1:00:18] right? Led by God into a trap.
[1:00:22] So the the Bible says in in in verse 18,
[1:00:26] it says, "But God led the people about
[1:00:28] through the way of the wilderness of the
[1:00:30] Red Sea. And the children of Israel went
[1:00:32] up harnessed out of the land of Egypt."
[1:00:34] It means they went up prepared for war
[1:00:36] because they expected to go right up
[1:00:37] through to Canaan. It's only three days
[1:00:40] journey, right? And they expected to go
[1:00:42] right up into Canaan, but instead they
[1:00:44] spent 45 years in the wilderness or 40
[1:00:47] years in the wilderness. And and but
[1:00:48] that wasn't God's fault. That was their
[1:00:50] own hardness of their heart. But yet
[1:00:52] when they headed out of Egypt, now they
[1:00:53] go the wrong direction. Now watch. They
[1:00:56] thought they were going to fight the
[1:00:57] Philistines and they that was their
[1:00:59] plan. They went up harnessed out of the
[1:01:00] land of Egypt. But God had a different
[1:01:02] plan because he knows the dangers of
[1:01:05] every route,
[1:01:08] right? So don't reject the leading of
[1:01:11] God because it seems to be leading you
[1:01:13] into a trap. Come on. Yeah. Right. You
[1:01:16] can't see a way out. And yet you see, I
[1:01:18] know it, but the Bible says to do it,
[1:01:20] but I don't see how I'm going to make
[1:01:22] it. Don't reject the leading of God
[1:01:25] because he knows more about your path
[1:01:28] than you do. Knows more about your path
[1:01:30] than I do. And so, he knows what the
[1:01:32] what the dangers of every route are. He
[1:01:35] knows what route it takes for you to
[1:01:37] make it. I I remember and uh you forgive
[1:01:40] me if I've repeated this story before,
[1:01:42] but there was a man in Memphis by the
[1:01:44] name of Brother Jerome Clayton and he's
[1:01:46] actually in brother McGary's church now
[1:01:48] in Dallas and and when he was at brother
[1:01:50] he come to brother Ivy's church for a
[1:01:51] while supernatural how he come to the
[1:01:53] message all on his own and and God
[1:01:55] showed him things and and he found a
[1:01:57] church and went to it and and but he
[1:01:59] always would tell me we went to the
[1:02:01] Philippines together and he he would
[1:02:03] just he was just heartbroken. He said,
[1:02:05] "Brother Ben, why couldn't I have found
[1:02:06] the message sooner?"
[1:02:09] Right? "Why couldn't I have grown up in
[1:02:10] the message?" He said, "You you come to
[1:02:12] the message. Your parents believe the
[1:02:14] message." He said, "For me," he said, "I
[1:02:15] was he I think he was in his 50s when he
[1:02:19] come to the message." Well, he'd already
[1:02:20] been married and she left him when he
[1:02:21] come in the message, divorced him, and
[1:02:24] and he'd already had a son, and he had
[1:02:26] gotten out in in Memphis in the gangs
[1:02:28] and and end up in prison. He told me, "I
[1:02:32] I wish I could have raised my children
[1:02:33] in church." church. He said, "I believe
[1:02:34] it with all of my heart, but I don't
[1:02:36] understand why God would allow me to
[1:02:37] take the route that I did."
[1:02:40] But you understand that God would not
[1:02:42] have allowed him to take that route
[1:02:44] unless it was the least dangerous route.
[1:02:47] It was the best route for him. Yeah. To
[1:02:51] become a Christian,
[1:02:53] right? I've told you before, I wanted to
[1:02:55] be educated. I wanted to go to college.
[1:02:56] I wanted to do all those things. But God
[1:02:58] sent me down the route he sent me down
[1:03:01] because
[1:03:03] Oh, if we just recognize the goodness of
[1:03:04] God, he sent me down the route. He sent
[1:03:07] me down because it was the only way I
[1:03:09] could be saved.
[1:03:11] It was the only way I could make it. And
[1:03:13] so, he leads you into what looks like a
[1:03:15] wrong situation, but he's leading you
[1:03:16] there anyway. Now, he won't lead you
[1:03:18] against the word, but he'll lead you
[1:03:19] into places that it seems impossible for
[1:03:22] you to make it out of, and yet you make
[1:03:24] it out of it somehow anyway. And what is
[1:03:26] that? He's led you through that in your
[1:03:28] life. All of us can think of times like
[1:03:29] that when you didn't understand. Why
[1:03:31] didn't I understand this before? Why
[1:03:33] didn't I know this before? Why did I
[1:03:35] have to take that journey to that other
[1:03:36] place? And you don't understand what
[1:03:38] that is. But God's leading you to the
[1:03:40] Red Sea because he wants to do a miracle
[1:03:43] in your life. He wants to show you some
[1:03:45] things and he wants to do Listen,
[1:03:47] Brother JT, you wonder why does God
[1:03:48] allow me to live all of my life and then
[1:03:50] I get sick when it's about time to
[1:03:52] retire? But it must be that he led you
[1:03:54] through that route because that's where
[1:03:55] he needed you to be. Whether to show a
[1:03:57] miracle in your body or to get you ready
[1:03:59] for the rapture one way or another, he
[1:04:01] knows what we need.
[1:04:07] Are you with me? This really helped me.
[1:04:08] I hope it helped somebody tonight. Good.
[1:04:12] They thought the Philistine route was
[1:04:13] the only route that would take them to
[1:04:15] the promised land. But God said, "I got
[1:04:16] another route. I'm going to take you
[1:04:18] right through the Red Sea and you're not
[1:04:21] going to be able to see how you're going
[1:04:23] to make it out. I'm going to make a way
[1:04:24] where there is no way.
[1:04:27] Hallelujah. See, many times what we take
[1:04:29] as punishment
[1:04:31] is actually protection.
[1:04:36] We think God is keeping us from good
[1:04:39] things.
[1:04:41] And it's actually protection. God, why
[1:04:43] couldn't I be rich?
[1:04:45] like the the singer in in Fiddler on the
[1:04:48] Roof, you know, when he sings, "If I
[1:04:50] were a rich man and all the things he'd
[1:04:52] have, but if he was a rich man, he
[1:04:54] wouldn't have been the man that he was."
[1:04:57] Right? So, God made you the way. Some
[1:04:59] men, he allow us to have more money and
[1:05:01] some people he allow us to and through
[1:05:03] no fault of your own. Sometimes through
[1:05:04] fault of our own, but sometimes through
[1:05:06] no fault of our own, we end up in a
[1:05:08] certain place. We say, "God, why did you
[1:05:10] allow me to be here? Why why would you
[1:05:11] allow a a woman to have her husband
[1:05:13] taken from him or or from her or or a
[1:05:16] family to lose their daddy or their mama
[1:05:18] or or cancer to enter into a house? Why
[1:05:20] would God even allow that to begin with?
[1:05:22] Because he already knew the route and
[1:05:23] what it would take for them because he
[1:05:25] will not force you to serve him. But he
[1:05:27] knows what it takes for you to serve
[1:05:29] him. And if you had to go go to a place
[1:05:31] that was very dark, he knew it was in
[1:05:33] the darkness of that prison that he
[1:05:35] could shine the light to you and show
[1:05:37] you what you ought to be. And he's so
[1:05:39] concerned with your character. But
[1:05:41] Isaac, he's so concerned with forming
[1:05:43] your character that he may put you in an
[1:05:45] almost impossible place because he wants
[1:05:48] you to act,
[1:05:50] right? He wants you to do something and
[1:05:52] so you don't see a way. I said, "Well, I
[1:05:53] don't see an exit, but the exit's
[1:05:55] already been planned. He's already got a
[1:05:57] way for you to make it out."
[1:06:01] Are you with me now? So, it's not
[1:06:03] punishment, it's protection.
[1:06:06] Yeah. In Exodus chapter 13 and verse 20
[1:06:09] says, "They took their journey from
[1:06:10] suckth and encamped in Etham in the edge
[1:06:12] of the wilderness. And the Lord went
[1:06:15] before them by day in a pillar of cloud
[1:06:17] to lead them the way by night in a
[1:06:20] pillar of fire to give them light to go
[1:06:21] by day and night." You know, I I don't
[1:06:23] care where he leads me as long as the
[1:06:25] pillar of fire is leading the way. As
[1:06:27] long as you're with me. That's what
[1:06:28] Moses said. He said, "Don't send us down
[1:06:30] here without your presence." He said,
[1:06:31] "But Lord, if your presence goes with
[1:06:33] us, we'll go anywhere. We'll do
[1:06:35] anything, but if your presence is not
[1:06:36] with us, he said, don't send us. Yeah.
[1:06:40] So, he took not away the pillar of the
[1:06:42] cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by
[1:06:43] night from before the people. And so,
[1:06:45] they begin to head off in the what
[1:06:47] seemed to be the wrong direction. And I
[1:06:50] can sure some of them began to doubt the
[1:06:51] leadership of the pillar of fire.
[1:06:55] Right? Because they, you know, some of
[1:06:59] them could had compasses or whatever. I
[1:07:00] don't know how. Maybe they looked at the
[1:07:02] sun. They said, "We know that Canaan is
[1:07:05] east
[1:07:07] of Egypt and we're going south.
[1:07:13] Can you imagine the murmuring in the
[1:07:15] camp?
[1:07:16] Are you sure we've done the right thing
[1:07:19] by leaving Egypt? It seems like Moses is
[1:07:21] more concerned with causing us to wander
[1:07:24] around without food or water than he is
[1:07:27] with leading us in the right direction.
[1:07:29] But he was following the pillar of fire.
[1:07:32] Right. So they begin to doubt that. Now
[1:07:35] the direction they took caused Pharaoh
[1:07:37] to pursue them which again seemed like
[1:07:40] another proof that it would be wrong. A
[1:07:43] as I preached to you before you know
[1:07:44] sometimes everything that you know all
[1:07:46] the proof that can come to you will come
[1:07:48] in the wrong direction. So when when
[1:07:50] when uh Elohim come to Abraham remember
[1:07:53] he made a body of flesh and come to him
[1:07:55] and and sprinkle dust on his clothes,
[1:07:58] right? We preached about that. He had
[1:07:59] dust all over his clothes. The evidence
[1:08:01] showed that these men had come from the
[1:08:03] earth.
[1:08:05] Right? That's what the dust showed that
[1:08:06] they come from the earth. But Abraham
[1:08:08] said, "I know there's something
[1:08:09] different about these men. They come
[1:08:11] from heaven in spite of the evidence."
[1:08:14] He believed, "Oh, it's going to take a
[1:08:16] bride like that to leave here one of
[1:08:17] these days of people that believe God.
[1:08:19] No matter what the evidence shows, but I
[1:08:21] believe that God is real. I believe he's
[1:08:23] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:08:25] I believe in what this message brought
[1:08:27] us." Yeah. in spite of whatever evidence
[1:08:30] people want to show to the contrary,
[1:08:32] realizing it's just there to test their
[1:08:34] faith. Look, the direction they took
[1:08:36] caused Pharaoh to pursue them. But
[1:08:38] that's what God wanted, right? Because
[1:08:40] when I would do good, evil is present.
[1:08:42] Exodus 14:1, the Lord spake to Moses,
[1:08:45] saying, speaking to the children of
[1:08:46] Israel that they turn and encamp before
[1:08:48] by Harroth between Mdall and the sea,
[1:08:51] over against Belafon, there before it
[1:08:54] shall you encamp by the sea. For Pharaoh
[1:08:56] will say of the children of Israel.
[1:08:58] God's told Moses this ahead of time.
[1:09:00] He's saying, "I want you to do this
[1:09:01] because Pharaoh's going to say that
[1:09:04] there they are entangled in the land."
[1:09:07] Right? God may have led you on a path
[1:09:09] and he said, "Now, the devil's going to
[1:09:11] say that you'll never serve God after."
[1:09:14] Didn't that what he said about Job? He
[1:09:15] said he'll never serve God after going
[1:09:17] through this. He said, "You take your
[1:09:19] hedge out from around him and let me
[1:09:21] touch him and he'll never serve you.
[1:09:22] He'll curse you." But he didn't do it.
[1:09:24] And God knew he wouldn't do it. So God
[1:09:28] actually tricked Pharaoh.
[1:09:31] Hallelujah. Because he knew the children
[1:09:33] of Israel needed to see their tormentors
[1:09:35] drowned under the sea. Listen to me.
[1:09:37] Sometimes he allows things to come upon
[1:09:39] you because he needs you to see that you
[1:09:41] can't do nothing by yourself. But when
[1:09:44] it comes time, he's going to destroy it.
[1:09:46] And when he destroys them, you're going
[1:09:47] to be able to watch them go under the
[1:09:49] water. Amen. Hallelujah. Pharaoh said,
[1:09:52] "They're entangled in the land. The
[1:09:55] wilderness has shut them in." They said,
[1:09:57] "And I will harden Pharaoh's heart that
[1:09:58] he shall follow after them. I will be
[1:10:01] honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his
[1:10:02] host that the Egyptians may know that I
[1:10:04] am the Lord." And they did so. And the
[1:10:06] Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh.
[1:10:08] Verse eight. And the king of Egypt, he
[1:10:10] pursued after the children of Israel.
[1:10:11] And the children of Israel went out with
[1:10:12] a high hand. But the Egyptians pursued
[1:10:15] after them all the horses and chariots
[1:10:18] of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army,
[1:10:20] and overtook them in camping by the sea.
[1:10:22] And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children
[1:10:24] of Israel lifted up their eyes, and
[1:10:26] behold, the Egyptians marched after
[1:10:28] them.
[1:10:30] Notice they lifted up their eyes, they
[1:10:32] could see
[1:10:34] the Egyptians coming. Right? And when
[1:10:37] they turned around this way, they could
[1:10:38] see a Red Sea. Brother Brandham said
[1:10:41] there was mountains on either side of
[1:10:42] them. Yeah, there was a Red Sea behind
[1:10:45] them and Pharaoh's army was this coming
[1:10:47] this direction. What were they going to
[1:10:48] do?
[1:10:50] Oh my.
[1:10:53] What are you going to do when you get in
[1:10:54] a place that seems impossible? Go in the
[1:10:57] direction he was leading.
[1:11:02] Even when the pillar of fire moved
[1:11:04] behind him instead of in front of him,
[1:11:05] he still protected them. But go in the
[1:11:07] direction he was leading you to. Don't
[1:11:10] stop now. Don't change directions now.
[1:11:12] Don't give up now. Go in that same
[1:11:14] direction. Keep your eyes set on the
[1:11:16] promised land. All right.
[1:11:20] And they saw, what is that? One of the
[1:11:23] five senses. They saw it.
[1:11:25] It proved to them they were going to
[1:11:27] die. Right? And they were so afraid. The
[1:11:30] children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
[1:11:31] They said to Moses, "Because there were
[1:11:33] no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us
[1:11:35] away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore
[1:11:38] hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us
[1:11:39] forth out of Egypt?" They blamed it all
[1:11:42] on the messenger like they'd never
[1:11:44] wanted to go in the first place.
[1:11:47] Is not this the word that we did tell
[1:11:49] thee in Egypt, saying, "Let us alone
[1:11:52] that we may serve the Egyptians. For it
[1:11:54] had been better for us to serve the
[1:11:56] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[1:12:00] wilderness." See, they never said that
[1:12:02] when God was plaguing the Egyptians. And
[1:12:05] they were and the Egyptians were giving
[1:12:06] them gold and food and everything else
[1:12:09] for the journey.
[1:12:10] But now they begin to complain.
[1:12:13] And and so many times, and I hope that
[1:12:15] you're listening tonight, and and and
[1:12:16] those that aren't here as well, if
[1:12:18] you're watching, I want you to listen
[1:12:19] closely to this. Fear is often what
[1:12:22] drives our negative response.
[1:12:26] Right? When we see something, when we
[1:12:28] hear something, when we experience
[1:12:31] something, it's fear that drives a
[1:12:34] negative response. If we weren't afraid,
[1:12:37] we wouldn't react in the way that we do.
[1:12:39] And it goes down to a trust issue,
[1:12:42] right, between us and God. And I think
[1:12:44] all of us could trust God more than we
[1:12:46] do now, right? Because if we really
[1:12:48] trust God, we would never be negative
[1:12:50] about anything.
[1:12:55] That's even hard on preachers because I
[1:12:57] get negative about myself,
[1:13:00] right? We get negative after preaching
[1:13:03] because you feel like you didn't get it
[1:13:04] across in the way that God gave it to
[1:13:05] you and it wasn't just as good as what
[1:13:07] what you so good when you hurt when you
[1:13:09] tasted it and then it was bitter in the
[1:13:12] stomach, you know, and it just maybe
[1:13:13] wasn't as good as what you thought it
[1:13:15] was going to be and you think you feel
[1:13:17] under unappreciated or underappreciated.
[1:13:19] I'm every other preacher does. I don't
[1:13:20] because y'all appreciate me so much. But
[1:13:23] but we all the devil can talk to us too.
[1:13:25] But if it wasn't for fear, we would have
[1:13:28] no negative response to anything that
[1:13:30] happened,
[1:13:32] right? But fear is actually what drives
[1:13:34] that negative response. If they really
[1:13:37] believe that God would take care of
[1:13:39] them, they'd have seen the Red Sea.
[1:13:40] They'd have seen the mountains. They'd
[1:13:42] have seen the Pharaoh's army. And they'd
[1:13:44] have said, "We're going to make it."
[1:13:47] Right? And that's what God wants in this
[1:13:48] hour. He wants a people who will see the
[1:13:50] Red Sea, who will see Pharaoh's army,
[1:13:52] who will see the mountains, and they'll
[1:13:54] say, "We're going to make it." Why?
[1:13:56] Because they're not living between two
[1:13:57] desires, but they've they've given
[1:13:59] Christ their heart. They've been married
[1:14:01] to the word. That's what that means. I
[1:14:03] I've fully given in and surrendered to
[1:14:06] the desire of the Lord.
[1:14:10] See, when we when we trust him the way
[1:14:12] that we should, fear loses its hold in
[1:14:14] our lives. Amen. In Exodus 14:13, Moses
[1:14:18] said to the people, "Fear you not. Stand
[1:14:20] still." So, he knew what the problem
[1:14:22] was. They were afraid. Yeah. He said,
[1:14:24] "Stand still and see the salvation of
[1:14:25] the Lord." Boy, what a message. Moses is
[1:14:28] just preaching a faith message right in
[1:14:31] the middle of trouble.
[1:14:33] Right? He's telling them, "Don't be
[1:14:35] afraid.
[1:14:36] Don't worry. See the salvation of the
[1:14:38] Lord, which he shall show you today. For
[1:14:40] the Egyptians whom you have seen today,
[1:14:43] you shall see them again. no more
[1:14:45] forever.
[1:14:48] I love this. Moses spoke that by faith
[1:14:53] because he believed God was going to
[1:14:54] carry him on over, but he didn't know
[1:14:55] how God was going to do it. But he spoke
[1:14:58] it by faith and knowing that, you know,
[1:15:01] between them and the Egyptians, somebody
[1:15:03] is going to get rid of the other one.
[1:15:07] Somebody's going to win today. And it
[1:15:09] must be us because we're the ones who
[1:15:11] are called by God. We're the ones who've
[1:15:13] led out. We're the ones who've seen the
[1:15:15] supernatural. So, it must be them
[1:15:19] who's going to meet their end. He said,
[1:15:21] "The Lord shall fight for you. You
[1:15:22] should hold your peace." He preached
[1:15:23] that powerful sermon of faith, and in
[1:15:25] his heart, he's crying to God.
[1:15:29] He's saying, "Lord, how?"
[1:15:32] I know you're going to take care of us,
[1:15:33] but I don't know how. Lord, show me.
[1:15:35] Show me what to do. Do we climb over the
[1:15:38] mountain? Do we fight? Do Do we What do
[1:15:41] we do? How can we do it? And the Lord
[1:15:45] said to Moses, this how we know Moses
[1:15:47] was crying in his heart because God told
[1:15:50] Moses, "Wherefore cryst thou unto me?
[1:15:52] Yes, sir.
[1:15:54] Speak unto the children of Israel that
[1:15:57] they go forward." Yes. He said, "Then we
[1:16:00] find out Moses had a commission to bring
[1:16:02] those people out of Egypt to that
[1:16:03] mountain and there it was in the line of
[1:16:04] duty and Moses began to cry to God." So
[1:16:07] you see how that goes in with what we
[1:16:08] were talking about thirst. Now they were
[1:16:10] in the line of duty. Brother Brandon
[1:16:11] said, "And Satan will always put an
[1:16:13] obstacle up in the line of duty. But you
[1:16:15] got a a responsibility and a promise and
[1:16:18] a and as Christians, what do we do?" We
[1:16:20] have such a a desire, a painful desire
[1:16:23] to serve God that we'll do what God
[1:16:25] says. We'll continue in the line of
[1:16:27] duty, even though it might hurt. Even
[1:16:29] though we don't know a way out, because
[1:16:31] we we just got to do the will of God.
[1:16:33] And that's what it comes down to,
[1:16:34] church. Now, look, in the line of duty,
[1:16:36] Moses began to cry to God when he saw
[1:16:38] the pillar of fire hanging up here. And
[1:16:40] there come Pharaoh's chariots. And he
[1:16:42] cried. The pillar of fire come down was
[1:16:43] light to them and darkness to them. And
[1:16:45] God said, "Why are you crying to me? I
[1:16:47] commissioned you to do it. Speak and go
[1:16:50] forward." He said, "The trouble of it is
[1:16:53] today the churches speak." It looked
[1:16:55] like say, "Well, what did Moody say?
[1:16:57] What did Sanki say?" They get in a tight
[1:16:58] spot and they go back to another
[1:16:59] generation, another message. That's what
[1:17:02] a lot of people do today even around the
[1:17:04] They go back to another message. Back to
[1:17:05] another generation. What did Moody say?
[1:17:07] What did Sanki say? speak and say what
[1:17:09] God said. Let's go forward, not look
[1:17:12] back. Go this way.
[1:17:15] See, everybody wants to look today at
[1:17:16] what YouTube says, sir. Everybody wants
[1:17:19] to look and see. I I see parents and and
[1:17:22] I don't I'm not trying to condemn you.
[1:17:23] And sometimes that stuff can be helpful,
[1:17:25] but I see parents, they become overly
[1:17:27] reliant on what the internet says about
[1:17:29] how to parent children. And we got a
[1:17:31] book that tells us,
[1:17:34] right?
[1:17:36] and they become overly reliant on on
[1:17:38] YouTube on on what to believe about the
[1:17:41] message or maybe on some preacher
[1:17:42] somewhere or something like that. But if
[1:17:44] God said go, let's just go.
[1:17:49] Everybody wants to look at what somebody
[1:17:51] else says and get somebody else's
[1:17:52] opinion. But if God said that we can
[1:17:54] have our healing, let's go forward and
[1:17:56] claim our healing. If God said he was
[1:17:58] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:18:00] let's go forward and believe that. We're
[1:18:02] not looking at nobody said, "Well, so
[1:18:03] and so failed and so and so failed."
[1:18:05] We're not looking at them. We're looking
[1:18:06] what the promise says.
[1:18:10] Not look what Moody said or what Sanki
[1:18:12] said or what the internet said or even
[1:18:15] what a former pastor, somebody else
[1:18:16] said, but let's look at what God said.
[1:18:19] Not even our current pastor. We're not
[1:18:20] just going to take what he says. Let's
[1:18:21] see what God says. When the when the
[1:18:23] former when the current when the pastor
[1:18:25] says what God says, we believe it,
[1:18:28] right? But if you don't say what God
[1:18:29] says, we're going to take what God says.
[1:18:32] So we we contrast what Moses did as
[1:18:36] we're trying to hurry through this
[1:18:37] tonight. We can say so much more about
[1:18:38] that, but I want to contrast that with
[1:18:40] Joshua who was in the heat of the
[1:18:42] battle. And what did he do? He said,
[1:18:44] "Son, stand still."
[1:18:48] Right? He He never prayed,
[1:18:52] sir. He never he never even gotten in
[1:18:54] the spirit to do it. But it just needed
[1:18:58] to be done. He didn't have time to call
[1:19:01] in an orchestra like the prophet did,
[1:19:04] right? To get in the right spirit to to
[1:19:06] prophesy. But but Joshua didn't have
[1:19:08] time. And in that emergency situation,
[1:19:13] when he didn't have time, there was
[1:19:14] nothing else he could do. He just spoke.
[1:19:19] He said, "Son, stand still."
[1:19:22] What a crazy thing to say.
[1:19:26] Because every time that that every day
[1:19:29] that he had ever lived, the sun had come
[1:19:31] up and he'd go down,
[1:19:35] right? He had years of evidence.
[1:19:39] Every time, every day, even if it was
[1:19:42] cloudy, he knew sun goes up, the sun
[1:19:45] goes back down.
[1:19:50] Every time you try to do the will of
[1:19:51] God, there's an obstacle.
[1:19:55] God put me in a place. He let me pastor
[1:19:57] a church in an area with the highest
[1:19:58] humidity
[1:20:02] and I got allergies.
[1:20:04] But you know what? We're going to
[1:20:06] overcome that obstacle.
[1:20:08] Are you with me now? So Joshua knew.
[1:20:11] Now, now he was fighting this battle.
[1:20:12] Now, there's something Joshua knew that
[1:20:14] we don't understand a lot of times. Are
[1:20:16] you still with me tonight? We don't
[1:20:18] understand the urgency of defeating the
[1:20:20] enemy while we're fighting him.
[1:20:24] Right? We don't just come to an
[1:20:26] agreement.
[1:20:28] I thought about this with this thing
[1:20:29] with Iran and Israel. You know, the
[1:20:31] thought occurred to me, they better make
[1:20:32] sure they destroyed all the nukes
[1:20:35] because if they live to fight another
[1:20:36] day, they'll fight harder
[1:20:39] and they'll learn from the battle and
[1:20:40] they'll hide stuff better and they'll go
[1:20:42] quicker towards a nuclear weapon. Right?
[1:20:45] So, when you're doing it, that's the
[1:20:46] lesson of World War II, unconditional
[1:20:48] surrender. That's why we've failed every
[1:20:50] other war we've been in because we we
[1:20:52] failed to learn that lesson. But in
[1:20:54] World War II, there was unconditional
[1:20:55] surrender. We're not going to let you
[1:20:56] give up. We're going to come in and take
[1:20:58] it. Right? And the reason for that is
[1:21:01] Joshua understood like these guys, if if
[1:21:03] I let if we stop at the end of the day,
[1:21:06] they're going to be that much stronger
[1:21:07] tomorrow.
[1:21:09] So, if you got depression, if you fight
[1:21:10] with uh if you fight with some spirit on
[1:21:13] you trying to make you do something
[1:21:14] that's not right, and you fight with
[1:21:15] that, and maybe you come to a place, you
[1:21:17] say, "Well, I feel pretty good. good. I
[1:21:18] can go to church. You keep fighting that
[1:21:19] thing,
[1:21:21] right? Keep fighting it. Don't let it
[1:21:22] sit there, right? Because as long as
[1:21:25] it's there and hasn't been gotten rid of
[1:21:27] completely, it'll get stronger and come
[1:21:29] back. You don't want to live at peace
[1:21:31] with it. You want to get rid of it.
[1:21:34] Well, you want a total deliverance. How
[1:21:35] many want that tonight? So, you speak
[1:21:38] and say what God said. Let's go forward.
[1:21:41] Let's let's go ahead. That's what Joshua
[1:21:42] did. So, Joshua knew if he let them live
[1:21:44] to fight another day, the battle would
[1:21:46] be twice as hard. So, Brother Brham
[1:21:47] said, "There's where ministers, there's
[1:21:49] where we fail." He said, "There's where
[1:21:50] the church fails. With this revival
[1:21:52] we've just had, this great campaign that
[1:21:54] started across the country." He said,
[1:21:55] "When we had the enemy running, we
[1:21:57] should have kept him on the run." He
[1:21:59] said, "But the thing of it is we just
[1:22:00] had to go off on tantrums and so forth.
[1:22:02] Big sprees of buildings and making more
[1:22:04] for our groups and so forth." He said,
[1:22:06] "And there you come and separating
[1:22:07] yourselves from the word and taking this
[1:22:09] that and then building up some more of
[1:22:11] their organization, starting something
[1:22:13] else." He said, "That's the way it
[1:22:14] always goes. That's the way it was in
[1:22:15] Luther and Wesley and Moody and Sakei
[1:22:17] and Finny and Nox and Calvin all the way
[1:22:19] down. It's been the same way. They get
[1:22:20] their eyes off of the revival and get it
[1:22:23] onto what they can do for themselves.
[1:22:26] Right. I I I've I've always been a I I
[1:22:28] love to study warfare and battles and
[1:22:30] things like that. I've always found one
[1:22:32] of the worst things that can happen is
[1:22:34] when the soldiers realize they can take
[1:22:36] the spoil of the enemy. And when they
[1:22:39] do, there's a counterattack coming and
[1:22:41] they're going to come back and destroy
[1:22:43] them because they think they can tell us
[1:22:45] what happened at the Battle of Shiloh in
[1:22:47] Tennessee. The the the Confederates got
[1:22:49] drunk on the Union whiskey and and it
[1:22:52] slowed them down enough that they lived
[1:22:53] to fight another day and they come back
[1:22:54] and defeated them the next day. Yeah. So
[1:22:57] what happens is they they get their eyes
[1:23:00] off of the revival. They say, "Well,
[1:23:01] let's build a church. Let's build a
[1:23:03] church isn't wrong." But when you just
[1:23:05] get your eyes on the money, you get your
[1:23:06] eyes on the people, you get your eyes on
[1:23:08] something else instead of saying, "Lord,
[1:23:10] keep us in revival. Let's follow the
[1:23:12] light of the word."
[1:23:15] Right? So, brother Brandon said that
[1:23:17] Joshua was different. He said the
[1:23:18] revival was almost at the end of the
[1:23:20] close of it like we stand today. He knew
[1:23:23] if he ever waited till the enemy gets
[1:23:24] fortified, got fortified against him, it
[1:23:26] would be hard to win that battle. You
[1:23:28] know what he did? He knew that God
[1:23:29] promised that land. He needed more time.
[1:23:32] So the sun was about to go down. He
[1:23:34] said, "Son, stand still." You say, "Oh,
[1:23:37] if I had to I if I know we just lived in
[1:23:40] that day." But Jesus said in Mark 11:24,
[1:23:42] "If you say to this mountain, be moved.
[1:23:44] And don't doubt in your heart, but
[1:23:45] believe what you said will come to pass,
[1:23:47] you can have what you said." He said,
[1:23:49] "Still grace." It was grace that caused
[1:23:51] the son to stop. And it's still grace
[1:23:53] today. And a paradox on down into our
[1:23:56] age. What's a paradox? A miracle, an
[1:23:59] impossibility, but yet it's still true.
[1:24:01] Yeah. Amen. He said that moon and sun
[1:24:05] stood still until Joshua fought his way
[1:24:07] through. Listen, he didn't ask God to to
[1:24:10] just take the battle away. But he said
[1:24:12] just give me more time. We got him on
[1:24:13] the run. How many could say that
[1:24:15] tonight? I got the I got the devil by
[1:24:17] the tail. I I just want to I just want
[1:24:19] to keep him on the run. I He's been
[1:24:21] running from me, but he wants to hide in
[1:24:23] the shadows of my life. I'm going to say
[1:24:25] I'm going to take a complete
[1:24:26] deliverance. I'm going to fight him,
[1:24:28] brother. As as the man said, he said,
[1:24:30] "I'm going to fight him with everything
[1:24:32] I got." He said, "I'm going to gum him."
[1:24:33] He said, "I'm going to bite him." He
[1:24:34] said, "It don't have no teeth, then I'll
[1:24:36] gum him to death."
[1:24:38] Right? Why cry? Speak. Go forward and
[1:24:42] fight. If you need
[1:24:45] light to fight in, he'll provide it.
[1:24:48] That tells me we're not out of a We're
[1:24:50] not in an era where revival is
[1:24:52] impossible.
[1:24:55] Worldwide revival is impossible. A
[1:24:57] sweeping revival in the nation's
[1:24:59] impossible, but revival is not
[1:25:00] impossible to Joshua because Joshua said
[1:25:04] that cycle of revival and death never
[1:25:06] failed. But Joshua stood in the midst of
[1:25:08] it and said, "Son, stand still." Because
[1:25:10] what was it? He was in the bride
[1:25:12] revival.
[1:25:15] Y'all know what I'm speaking of tonight.
[1:25:17] Brother Bren said, he said, he said,
[1:25:19] "You go out there and say mountain move.
[1:25:21] I want to show you I can do it." It
[1:25:22] won't do it. But if it's in the line of
[1:25:24] duty when God has commanded you to do
[1:25:26] something, he said like he said to
[1:25:28] Moses, "Why cry to me? Speak to the
[1:25:29] children." People today is crying all
[1:25:31] the time, Lord, what next? What next?
[1:25:34] Just speak and go forward. He said,
[1:25:36] "That's right. God has commissioned us
[1:25:37] to do something. Let's do it."
[1:25:40] Don't stand around and think about it.
[1:25:42] Say, "How can it happen?" Well, this
[1:25:44] this is that. He said, "Makes any
[1:25:47] difference. If God said it, do it
[1:25:48] anyhow." He's still the God of miracles.
[1:25:51] How many believe that today? He's still
[1:25:52] the God of miracles. He can still do a
[1:25:55] paradox. But that cycle of revival and
[1:25:58] death stopped with Joshua. It's never
[1:26:00] failed. But it but it stopped with
[1:26:02] Joshua. Let's keep the devil on the run
[1:26:04] till the death is defeated. That's what
[1:26:06] we're headed for is a rapture. This
[1:26:08] revival doesn't end until we've whipped
[1:26:11] every enemy. And the Bible said the last
[1:26:13] enemy that'll be destroyed is death. He
[1:26:15] said he'll continue putting the devil
[1:26:16] under his feet until every enemy is
[1:26:18] destroyed. And the last enemy is death.
[1:26:21] Yeah. See, Joshua, brother Brandon said
[1:26:23] Joshua understood. Moses forgot.
[1:26:28] He said God had to call his attention to
[1:26:30] it. Yeah. How many times he done that to
[1:26:33] you and to me? Why are you crying to me?
[1:26:36] I sent you to do the job. Speak and go
[1:26:39] on to your objective.
[1:26:41] Hallelujah. I told you you'd come to
[1:26:43] this mountain. Take them children and
[1:26:44] lead them on. Just speak. I don't care
[1:26:46] what's in your way. He said, "Move it
[1:26:48] out of the way. I give you authority to
[1:26:50] do it. He said, 'You spoke flies and
[1:26:52] fleas and creation and things like that.
[1:26:54] He said, 'No, what are you hollering to
[1:26:55] me about? He said, 'Why are you coming
[1:26:58] to me hollering these things? Just speak
[1:26:59] and watch it move. See, and and he goes
[1:27:02] and he tells about Samson. Samson didn't
[1:27:04] cry when they shut the gates.
[1:27:07] He didn't sit there and said, "Oh no,
[1:27:10] 600 lb gates. How am I ever going to do
[1:27:12] that?" They were in his way.
[1:27:17] And he was anointed by God. Yeah. And so
[1:27:20] what does he do when something's in your
[1:27:21] way? What do you do? H how did how did
[1:27:24] Grant take Richmond as he came to it?
[1:27:27] Right? How do you take the gates? You
[1:27:28] just walk to them. You pick them up and
[1:27:30] you carry them. He said, "But I can't
[1:27:32] carry them." That's not what the word
[1:27:34] says. If if it's on the other side, if
[1:27:37] if if the promise is laying on the other
[1:27:39] side of those gates, then you know, he
[1:27:41] said, "My your seed will possess the
[1:27:43] gate of his enemy." So the promise is
[1:27:46] you're going to be able to make it. A
[1:27:47] man can't do that. But he was in the
[1:27:49] line of duty. Nothing can stand in his
[1:27:51] way. But the Bram said he had an
[1:27:52] anointed gift from God. He didn't have
[1:27:54] to cry out, "Lord, what must I do now?"
[1:27:56] He was already anointed to do it. He
[1:27:58] said that was thus sayeth the Lord. Get
[1:27:59] rid of them. Hallelujah. Get rid of
[1:28:00] them. I've raised you up for that
[1:28:02] purpose. What did he do? He just walked
[1:28:04] right through the gates. Put him on his
[1:28:06] shoulders, climbed up a mountain, sat
[1:28:08] down.
[1:28:10] Now, Brother Brandham's talking about
[1:28:11] himself. I know sometimes that's hard
[1:28:13] for us to hear, but it's true. the the
[1:28:16] message why Christ speak is a very
[1:28:18] personal message to brother Brandham. He
[1:28:19] said I was trying to get you know
[1:28:21] meetings and trying to figure out he
[1:28:23] said always he said I'd wait to have
[1:28:25] meetings until God showed me and God was
[1:28:27] fixing to change his ministry over to
[1:28:28] the opening of the word. We see that in
[1:28:31] hindsight but God didn't show him
[1:28:32] everything
[1:28:34] right going into it. So he's looking at
[1:28:35] said, "What do I do, Lord?" He said,
[1:28:37] "I've always waited on the leadership of
[1:28:39] the spirit, the leadership of the Lord."
[1:28:40] And God didn't show him anything.
[1:28:43] And and Brother Ran preaches messages
[1:28:45] like Time of Decision and My New
[1:28:46] Ministry and all those messages where he
[1:28:48] talks about how much he struggled. At
[1:28:50] one point, he even come off the field
[1:28:52] because he he just didn't understand why
[1:28:54] things the meetings were dying down and
[1:28:56] he knew something was changing, but he
[1:28:57] didn't know what it was. He knew he had
[1:28:59] a new ministry, but he wasn't sure of
[1:29:01] the nature of that ministry. So because
[1:29:04] God God uh bring he he interprets his
[1:29:07] word by bringing it to pass and that's
[1:29:08] what he did. So uh brother Brandham was
[1:29:11] talking about himself and he brother
[1:29:13] Brandham in that sermon uh why Christ
[1:29:15] speak the Lord spoke to him. He said
[1:29:16] didn't I write your name on a mountain?
[1:29:20] If I wrote your name on a mountain he
[1:29:22] said why Christ speak?
[1:29:25] Are you with me now? Oh church don't you
[1:29:28] realize you're the bride of Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ? He said well I'm not going to be
[1:29:31] able to do it. I I just can't live like
[1:29:33] I should. I just can't do what I should.
[1:29:35] Maybe some of you mamas get to the point
[1:29:36] where you feel so discouraged. You say,
[1:29:38] "I just don't have time in the day to do
[1:29:40] what I need to do and take care of my
[1:29:42] children and and serve and do the things
[1:29:44] I need to do for my husband and help at
[1:29:46] the church. I just don't have time to do
[1:29:47] it." And many people will back up from
[1:29:49] that. But God said, "I've given you a
[1:29:51] responsibility. And if he gave you a
[1:29:53] responsibility, if he gave you children,
[1:29:56] if he anointed you to do it, then what
[1:29:57] is he going to do? He's going to make it
[1:29:59] you able to do it in your darkest hour.
[1:30:02] You can walk through them gates. You can
[1:30:05] speak to that son. Don't cry about it.
[1:30:07] Speak and go forward. Do what God's
[1:30:10] called you to do. Brother said David was
[1:30:12] anointed to be king. And he was a good
[1:30:14] shot.
[1:30:16] That's all he knew. God didn't show him
[1:30:18] and say, "Well, Goliath's coming. You
[1:30:20] need to go you need to go out here and
[1:30:22] and train for Goliath." God didn't show
[1:30:24] him that, but he was training him
[1:30:25] anyway.
[1:30:27] So all David knew is he was anointed and
[1:30:30] he was a good shot. And Goliath come up
[1:30:32] in front of him and what did he do? He
[1:30:34] picked up his his sling. He told Saul,
[1:30:36] he said, "I can't use your armor. I
[1:30:38] don't know it." So he used what he knew.
[1:30:41] Oh my. That that would be good for us as
[1:30:43] preachers, we got to preach what we
[1:30:44] know. We got to use what God give us. We
[1:30:46] can't use somebody else's anointing. We
[1:30:48] got to use what God give us. So he used
[1:30:51] what God give him. And and he was
[1:30:53] anointed. And he was vindicated to be a
[1:30:55] good shot cuz he killed the lion, killed
[1:30:56] the bear. You realize what God what
[1:30:59] happened? You said, "Why did the lion
[1:31:01] come against me?" God wanted to
[1:31:02] vindicate you. Why did the bear come
[1:31:05] against me? God wanted to vindicate.
[1:31:07] Brother Joe, that you'd stay in the
[1:31:08] house of God, that you live for God. And
[1:31:10] if he vindicated you to be a pillar of
[1:31:13] the church, if he vindicated you to be a
[1:31:14] person who's not easily shaken, then
[1:31:17] when tougher times come, you can walk
[1:31:19] right up to it and say, "I know I'm a
[1:31:20] good shot and I know I'm anointed, so
[1:31:22] I'm going to go out and kill this
[1:31:24] Goliath." He said, "Today, I'm going to
[1:31:26] take your head from you." He didn't know
[1:31:27] exactly how God was going to do it. All
[1:31:29] he had to do was move his arm and
[1:31:31] release the stone. Oh, glory to God. By
[1:31:34] faith, he released it. And when he did,
[1:31:36] it went to its the exact place where it
[1:31:38] do the most damage. Right. David was
[1:31:41] anointed and vindicated. Goliath was
[1:31:43] anyway till he took what he knew and
[1:31:44] trusted and defeated him with that. But
[1:31:46] the Brandon said God must have got
[1:31:47] enough of Moses. I I'm almost done. I'm
[1:31:50] out of time.
[1:31:52] Some of y'all wanted me to preach longer
[1:31:53] on Wednesday nights. I
[1:31:56] Boy, it got quiet, didn't it?
[1:32:03] He said, "Why are you crying to me about
[1:32:05] it?" God got fed up with it. Didn't I
[1:32:07] tell you to go do this? Didn't I promise
[1:32:09] I'd do it? I'd be with your mouth. I'd
[1:32:11] speak through you. I'd do this. You'd
[1:32:12] show signs and wonders. I'm going to
[1:32:14] skip through some of this, Sister
[1:32:15] Joanna, so I apologize, but didn't I
[1:32:18] promise to do it? He said, "Have not.
[1:32:19] I've done it just exactly." He He said
[1:32:22] on down, he said, he said, "Oh," he
[1:32:24] said, "you know you have need of it. You
[1:32:26] know, you're going to take these
[1:32:27] children to the promised land. You're
[1:32:28] pinned up here in a corner, right?
[1:32:30] Nothing else you can do. So, there's a
[1:32:31] need. What are you crying to me about?
[1:32:33] What are you looking at me for? What are
[1:32:34] you calling on me about? Haven't I
[1:32:36] proved it to the people?" He said, 'I
[1:32:37] promised I'd be with your lips. Didn't I
[1:32:40] call you and say I sent you to do it?
[1:32:42] The man was preaching that himself. I'd
[1:32:44] vindicate and prove it. Haven't I done
[1:32:45] it? He said, ' Then when any little
[1:32:47] thing comes up, he said, "Why do you act
[1:32:48] like a baby? You ought to be a man.
[1:32:51] Speak to the people. Come on. Then move
[1:32:54] forward. There you are. Don't cry.
[1:32:56] Speak. What are you crying to me about?
[1:32:57] Just speak to the people. Go forward to
[1:32:59] your objective. Whatever it is, if it's
[1:33:00] sickness, whatever it is, to raise the
[1:33:02] dead, whatever it is, speak. I proved
[1:33:03] it. Speak to the people." He said, "What
[1:33:05] a lesson." He said, "Oh my, at this
[1:33:07] stage of the journey where we are
[1:33:09] standing, look where we're at now." Yes,
[1:33:11] sir. At the third pole. This is when
[1:33:13] July of 1963. He said, "Yes, they're at
[1:33:16] the third pole." Notice we're right here
[1:33:17] at the door of the coming of the Lord.
[1:33:20] Oh, God was about to do something. And
[1:33:22] God was already unfolding the the
[1:33:24] opening of the word in his life. And he
[1:33:26] told him, he said, "Don't cry to me.
[1:33:27] Speak and do what you're called to do.
[1:33:32] This is the hour to speak. Don't be
[1:33:33] afraid. Speak the word and go forward.
[1:33:36] But the children of Israel were living
[1:33:37] between those two desires. So it's easy
[1:33:38] for them to look at what they could see
[1:33:40] and hear and then imagine their death at
[1:33:42] the hands of the Egyptians. Right?
[1:33:45] Because the five senses of the body feed
[1:33:46] into the five senses of the spirit. You
[1:33:49] married people know what I'm talking
[1:33:51] about because your five senses something
[1:33:54] will happen. Somebody will say something
[1:33:55] to you. You'll see it. You'll say that
[1:33:57] was disrespectful.
[1:34:00] Right? And then what does that do? I
[1:34:02] don't know who I'm preaching to tonight,
[1:34:03] but it feeds in into your imagination,
[1:34:06] right? Or maybe just around the church.
[1:34:08] Don't have to be married people. Maybe
[1:34:09] the pastor walks by and doesn't shake
[1:34:11] your hand and because he would had
[1:34:13] something on his mind, he was going so
[1:34:14] right. Now I'm speaking to myself in the
[1:34:16] third person. I am getting old,
[1:34:21] but he didn't mean to do that. I'm
[1:34:22] closing in just a moment. He didn't mean
[1:34:25] to do that. But but what was it then?
[1:34:27] You're you see it, right? you felt it or
[1:34:30] you lacked the feeling of it. Usually he
[1:34:33] shakes my hand, right? That the devil
[1:34:35] does that to me, too,
[1:34:37] right? Somebody don't show up at church.
[1:34:39] Well, they must be backslid,
[1:34:41] huh? Well, they probably not, but the
[1:34:43] devil make you think that, right? Maybe
[1:34:46] then it won't ever come back, right? And
[1:34:49] well, it's just the imagination. So, the
[1:34:51] five senses of the flesh feed into the
[1:34:53] five senses of the spirit and and pretty
[1:34:55] soon you imagine your death. Right.
[1:34:59] Right. That's what they did. They said,
[1:35:01] "We're going to die." Moses saw the same
[1:35:03] thing.
[1:35:05] He felt the same thing. He could reach
[1:35:07] down on this side and feel water. He
[1:35:10] knew that water was real. And that sea
[1:35:12] was too deep for them to cross. He
[1:35:14] didn't have any boats. He had no way of
[1:35:17] making it through. Like some of you get
[1:35:20] at the end of the month, you say, "How
[1:35:21] are we going to make it this month?" But
[1:35:22] God will make a way. Right. Amen. And
[1:35:25] Moses saw it and he felt it. But he
[1:35:27] chose to obey God anyway. He saw the
[1:35:30] same thing they did. Felt the same thing
[1:35:32] they did. But the obstacle, he didn't
[1:35:33] let it bother him. He said, "I'm not
[1:35:35] going to stay between two desires. I'm
[1:35:37] going to follow the desire of the Lord.
[1:35:39] I I got a painful desire to serve God,
[1:35:42] to do the will of God, but I'm going to
[1:35:43] do it."
[1:35:47] God, but God told him, "Lift up your rod
[1:35:48] and stretch it out, and the children of
[1:35:49] Israel should go on dry ground." God was
[1:35:51] moving behind the scenes.
[1:35:53] Angel God went and removed and went
[1:35:54] behind them. The pillar of cloud went
[1:35:56] from before their face stood behind him.
[1:35:58] If he brought you to a Red Sea, he'll
[1:36:00] keep you from the enemy.
[1:36:02] And Moses stretched out his hand, verse
[1:36:04] 21, over the sea. And the Lord caused
[1:36:06] the sea to go back by a strong east wind
[1:36:08] all that night. May the sea dry land and
[1:36:10] the waters were divided. What did God
[1:36:11] do? Exactly what he said he would do.
[1:36:13] Brother Brandon said it looked like here
[1:36:15] was Moses and Israel right in the line
[1:36:16] of duty with a pillar of fire leading
[1:36:17] them and led them right down into a
[1:36:19] trap. Listen to this statement. God
[1:36:21] likes to get his people in traps.
[1:36:26] Come on now. See what they'll do.
[1:36:30] Amen. Every son that cometh to God must
[1:36:32] first be tried and chasened. He gets him
[1:36:35] there. He brings you here. He puts you
[1:36:38] in between opinions.
[1:36:40] Now, that could be mental telepathy.
[1:36:42] Could it be? He put you in a trap to see
[1:36:44] what kind of a decision you're going to
[1:36:45] make. That's right. Search the
[1:36:46] scripture. Jesus said, "They testify
[1:36:48] me." You know, God lets it get that way.
[1:36:50] So, he brought them right into a trap
[1:36:52] between death on one side and death on
[1:36:54] the other side. Sometimes he does that.
[1:36:56] Let the doctor walk away and say, "You
[1:36:58] ain't going to live. You're going to
[1:36:58] die. That cancer is going to kill you.
[1:37:00] You'll never get up out of that chair."
[1:37:02] It seemed like he leaves you with no
[1:37:03] retreat. But he is your retreat. How
[1:37:06] many can say amen to that tonight? He is
[1:37:08] your retreat. Fall back into his arms,
[1:37:12] sir. What do you do to stop living
[1:37:13] between two desires? The desire that you
[1:37:17] have for God and his word must be life
[1:37:20] or death. Yeah. Right. Right. To a
[1:37:23] Christian when he's not doing what he's
[1:37:26] supposed to be doing or she's not doing
[1:37:28] what she's supposed to be doing, there's
[1:37:30] something inside it becomes painful.
[1:37:34] I'm doing this instead of being where
[1:37:36] God wanted me to be. And it's painful.
[1:37:38] Yeah. It hurts. And I got to get back.
[1:37:43] See, I've said this before, but the pain
[1:37:46] of the separation has to be more than
[1:37:48] the pleasure of the sin. Yeah. The pain
[1:37:52] of separation, that's what you do when
[1:37:53] you discipline your children. What do
[1:37:54] you do? You spank them. What do you
[1:37:56] spank them? Because the pain, the pain
[1:37:57] has to be greater than the pleasure they
[1:38:00] got in doing it or they'll do it again,
[1:38:04] right? And God allows us to get into
[1:38:06] spots, into tight spots sometimes
[1:38:08] because he wants us to be to desire him.
[1:38:11] Yeah. He he's disciplining his children.
[1:38:14] He's chasening his children. He He wants
[1:38:16] us to desire him. I think of CS Lewis
[1:38:18] who made the statement. He said, "It
[1:38:19] seems that our Lord finds our desires
[1:38:21] are not too strong, but they're too
[1:38:23] weak." Right? He said, "We follow, we
[1:38:26] fool about half-heartedly with drink and
[1:38:28] sex and ambition when infinite joy is
[1:38:30] offered to us. And like an ignorant
[1:38:32] child playing with mud pies in a slum
[1:38:36] because he can't imagine what's meant by
[1:38:37] the offer of a vacation at the sea."
[1:38:41] He said, "We are far too easily
[1:38:43] pleased."
[1:38:45] Oh, God. But how do you get out from
[1:38:47] between two opinions? As the heart
[1:38:50] pants for the waterbrooks,
[1:38:54] as the musicians come, the heart pants
[1:38:56] for the waterbrooks. The art desires
[1:38:59] something about it. It's between life
[1:39:01] and death. It's got to become real to
[1:39:03] you. You got to recognize the danger.
[1:39:09] Brother Bram talked about how in Africa
[1:39:10] and in Israel where David was when he
[1:39:12] wrote that there was wild dogs and the
[1:39:15] wild dogs weren't like that beagle we've
[1:39:16] got wouldn't hurt a fly tried to chase a
[1:39:20] rabbit and the rabbit just taunts him at
[1:39:22] the end of his chain.
[1:39:26] But he ain't like that them wild dogs
[1:39:29] are worse sometimes than a lion or a
[1:39:31] tiger because they work in packs. are
[1:39:33] ferocious
[1:39:35] and a deer, it's a death sentence to get
[1:39:38] chased by one and they catch you.
[1:39:41] But if a deer got caught, brother
[1:39:42] Brandon said sometimes they grab them by
[1:39:44] the neck and and throw their weight down
[1:39:46] and then the deer was gone. But
[1:39:48] sometimes they just grab them by the
[1:39:50] heel or grab them in another spot in
[1:39:52] their body and it would cause them to
[1:39:53] bleed. They knew right where by instinct
[1:39:56] the dog knows right where to get to make
[1:39:58] them bleed the most.
[1:40:00] And when they grab a hold of them,
[1:40:04] they begin to bleed out. And there's
[1:40:07] only one remedy for the deer. Oh, I'm
[1:40:09] going to tell you tonight, church,
[1:40:10] there's only one remedy if you're caught
[1:40:12] between two opinions. There's only one
[1:40:14] remedy if you don't know what to do.
[1:40:16] Find that desire for God that's so
[1:40:18] great. It's like a deer that got hurt,
[1:40:20] got wounded, and wants the water so
[1:40:23] badly that they'll put forth all their
[1:40:26] effort. Even though the harder they run,
[1:40:28] the more the the the heart pumps the
[1:40:30] blood out of the body, but they say,
[1:40:32] "I've got to get to the water." Brother
[1:40:34] said, "There's something about the water
[1:40:36] that stops the bleeding." Listen to me,
[1:40:38] church. That's the way I feel about
[1:40:39] being in the house of God. There's some
[1:40:40] there's a painful desire in my heart. I
[1:40:43] want to get to the water cuz if I can
[1:40:44] get in his presence, oh, church, if I
[1:40:47] can get in his presence, so I can get
[1:40:49] where the water, where the spirit is, I
[1:40:51] know I know that he can stop the
[1:40:53] bleeding. Whatever the devil's wounded
[1:40:56] me by, whatever he's wounded you by,
[1:40:58] you're he's able to stop the bleeding.
[1:41:00] There's something about the water. It
[1:41:02] has something in it and it's so cold and
[1:41:04] so good, it actually stops. It makes the
[1:41:07] blood thicken up. Stops the bleeding.
[1:41:10] But brother Brandon said, "When we come
[1:41:11] at it kind of halfway," he said, "Well,
[1:41:14] I'll kneel down and see what the Lord
[1:41:15] does." See, you're not really thirsting
[1:41:17] yet. He said, "It's got to be a thirst
[1:41:19] between death and life, and then
[1:41:21] something takes place." There had to be
[1:41:23] a cry in Moses' heart. Lord, I'm going
[1:41:25] to do whatever you say. And God said,
[1:41:27] why Christ speak? Go forward.
[1:41:30] Go to the water.
[1:41:33] Go to the go to the place. Go to the
[1:41:34] house of God. David said, I was about to
[1:41:36] backside. He said, my feet my feet were
[1:41:39] in slippery places. He said, but then I
[1:41:41] went to the house of God and I saw the
[1:41:43] end of the wicked man. He said, and I I
[1:41:46] realized that I was going to be okay.
[1:41:49] Oh, church, we just recognize that
[1:41:51] tonight.
[1:41:53] Hallelujah. I wonder if the word of God
[1:41:55] could become so precious to us that we
[1:41:57] would do anything to keep it. And and
[1:42:00] many times you say, "Well, why can't I
[1:42:01] feel the presence of God like I used to?
[1:42:03] Why am I in this slump? Why is it that
[1:42:05] I've come to a place where it seemed
[1:42:06] like I can't serve him like I want to?"
[1:42:08] Maybe he let you get to that place
[1:42:10] because he wants that desire for him to
[1:42:12] increase in your heart until it becomes
[1:42:15] so painful. You do anything to receive
[1:42:17] the Holy Ghost. You do anything for a
[1:42:19] refilling. You do anything to serve him.
[1:42:23] Hallelujah. May it become that precious
[1:42:25] to us tonight. You can say, "I I'm I'm
[1:42:28] going to speak to my mountain and walk
[1:42:30] through it because I believe speak to my
[1:42:32] Red Sea and turn a trap into a testimony
[1:42:35] cuz I believe he's going to do it."
[1:42:37] Would you bow your heads with me
[1:42:38] tonight? That's how to get out from
[1:42:40] between two desires or two opinions. The
[1:42:43] Bible says, "Why halt you between two
[1:42:44] opinions?" If the Lord is God, serve
[1:42:46] him. That's what Elijah said to the
[1:42:49] prophets of Baal. If the Lord is God,
[1:42:52] serve him. Baal be God. Serve him. Don't
[1:42:54] stay in the middle. Let that desire
[1:42:57] increase in your heart for God. Oh, that
[1:43:00] God would give us a heart desire for
[1:43:01] revival.
[1:43:03] Every one of us would give a heart
[1:43:05] desire to see revival in the house of
[1:43:07] God. Revival in our area. Revival. We
[1:43:09] got meetings coming up. Say, "Oh, God,
[1:43:12] I've seen you heal the sick in our
[1:43:13] meetings. I've seen you bring people
[1:43:14] into the house of God. Would you do it
[1:43:16] again, Lord? Would you do it again?
[1:43:19] Maybe you got rid of that feeling that
[1:43:20] you had when you got saved, when you
[1:43:22] come to God, and it just that feeling is
[1:43:24] not there anymore. God, I know it's
[1:43:26] still there for me. I know there's still
[1:43:28] revival for me. Let me let me hunger for
[1:43:30] it, Lord. Let me thirst for it with that
[1:43:33] painful desire.
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:36] I'm not going to let anything get in my
[1:43:38] way. I'm going to serve you with all of
[1:43:41] my heart.
[1:43:42] I'm not going to look at what the eyes
[1:43:43] see or what the ears hear, what I can
[1:43:45] feel, what I can smell, but I'm going to
[1:43:48] look at you, Lord, and I'm going to
[1:43:49] believe you by the six sense.
[1:43:53] Hallelujah. I'm going to believe your
[1:43:55] word. Heavenly Father,
[1:43:58] Lord Jesus, I pray that you just move
[1:44:00] tonight. And Lord, I know it's not a a
[1:44:02] big service or even a Sunday service,
[1:44:06] Lord, on a Wednesday night. Lord, I know
[1:44:09] a revival is not not bringing in new
[1:44:12] members, but your prophet taught us that
[1:44:14] a revival was just letting the sea get
[1:44:18] stirred up. The water that was already
[1:44:20] there get stirred up and a moving of the
[1:44:22] spirit that would cause the sin to go
[1:44:25] out on the edge and people to recognize
[1:44:27] their need of God. Oh, I pray it would
[1:44:29] be so here tonight. Lord, wash all the
[1:44:31] trash out of us. all the old ideas, what
[1:44:34] whatever's been holding us back from
[1:44:36] fully committing to the will of God in
[1:44:38] our lives. Lord, help us. Help us to let
[1:44:40] go of it and do the will of God. I pray
[1:44:43] you'd grant it. Lord, we want to see
[1:44:45] miracles. We don't want everything to
[1:44:47] just happen because we planned it. We
[1:44:48] want to see miracles. And Lord,
[1:44:50] sometimes you let us be surprised
[1:44:52] because that's what your desire is.
[1:44:54] Well, you want to do miracles for us. I
[1:44:57] pray God we would accept those miracles
[1:44:59] tonight and believe for them Lord and
[1:45:01] walk forward. Give us a hunger Lord.
[1:45:04] Give us a thirst,
[1:45:07] oh God, for me and my family, for my
[1:45:09] children, for our young people who I
[1:45:11] love so much, Lord. Lord, I just think
[1:45:13] about them every day and think about all
[1:45:15] that, Lord, the potential that they
[1:45:17] have. I pray you'd put a painful desire
[1:45:19] in their hearts. Even if mom and dad
[1:45:22] don't want to come to church, then put a
[1:45:23] desire in the hearts of the young
[1:45:25] people, Lord, that they'd want to come
[1:45:26] to the house of God. Lord, put a desire
[1:45:29] in the hearts of of every man and woman,
[1:45:31] boy and girl and our elders, Lord, we
[1:45:33] thank you for what we've seen, for their
[1:45:35] faithfulness, oh God, but at this late
[1:45:37] hour, may they not fall back or
[1:45:38] backslide at this time, but may they may
[1:45:41] they have a fervent desire to serve you.
[1:45:43] Oh God, I pray it would be so tonight.
[1:45:46] We love you and we thank you for this
[1:45:47] service. been committed to your hands in
[1:45:50] Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[1:45:53] I'm sorry I held you extra long tonight,
[1:45:55] but you you'll forgive me. Let's just
[1:45:56] worship the Lord with all of our heart.
[1:45:59] If you need to pray, the altar's open.
[1:46:01] It's still there for you. You can walk
[1:46:04] you can walk through the obstacle. It's
[1:46:06] it's not too big that you can't go over
[1:46:08] it. It's not too too deep that you can't
[1:46:10] He can't part the sea. He can still do
[1:46:13] that today. Why don't you believe in a
[1:46:14] God of miracles? If you want to come
[1:46:16] pray, come pray with our sister. We'll
[1:46:18] be have a time of prayer before we go
[1:46:19] tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:46:22] just stand together. Amen. Worship him.
[1:46:26] Worship him. Pray where you're at.
[1:46:27] Whatever you want to do, you're welcome
[1:46:29] to the altar. Break every chain.
[1:46:32] Hallelujah.
[1:46:34] Oh, there is power
[1:46:37] in the name. Hallelujah.
[1:46:41] Oh, we love you, Lord Jesus. Oh, send
[1:46:43] revival among us, oh God. Stir our
[1:46:46] hearts, Lord. Put a painful desire in
[1:46:49] our hearts to serve you, oh God. Oh,
[1:46:51] there is power
[1:46:54] in the name of Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[1:47:00] Oh, to break every chain. Hallelujah.
[1:47:02] Break every chain. Oh, break every
[1:47:06] chain.
[1:47:08] To break every chain. Break every chain.
[1:47:13] and break every chain.
[1:47:16] Oh, there's an army
[1:47:20] rise
[1:47:22] up. Don't you want to be part of that
[1:47:24] army tonight? Oh, there's an army
[1:47:29] rising
[1:47:31] up. Oh yes. Oh, there is only
[1:47:37] rising
[1:47:39] up. Oh yes. To break every chain. Break
[1:47:45] every chain. Break every chain. Oh yes.

[1:47:54] chain. Break. Break every chain. I want
[1:47:57] us to I want us to do something tonight.
[1:48:00] I don't usually do this, but I know the
[1:48:02] presence of the Lord is here. Would you
[1:48:04] come gather around and let's just have a
[1:48:06] season of prayer together. We're just
[1:48:08] we're not many of us here tonight, but
[1:48:10] we've got people praying here at the
[1:48:12] altar and and we'll just gather around
[1:48:14] as a body of believers. And those of you
[1:48:16] who are watching tonight, maybe you're
[1:48:17] in your home and you weren't able to
[1:48:18] come, just gather here around the front,
[1:48:20] just as close as you can get and and and
[1:48:23] just let's just we'll just pray. We'll
[1:48:25] have a season of prayer for all of us.
[1:48:27] Our children, they need that painful
[1:48:29] desire to serve the Lord. They need
[1:48:31] that. We need that. We need something in
[1:48:33] our hearts that'll make us serve God,
[1:48:36] make us do the will of God. Maybe you
[1:48:37] don't know the will of God. He's able to
[1:48:39] show you tonight. He's able to lead you.
[1:48:41] And if you know what it is, then just

[1:50:33] that are seeking you with all of their
[1:50:34] heart, Lord, and they married, Lord,
[1:50:36] maybe the little children, they don't
[1:50:37] always know what to do, but Lord, you we
[1:50:40] know that you are the God of wisdom.
[1:50:42] You're able to teach them, Lord. And if
[1:50:43] there's no obstacle too big that you
[1:50:46] can't help them, oh God, I pray for
[1:50:48] those that aren't here tonight that are
[1:50:49] watching, Lord, and watching and or
[1:50:51] maybe they weren't able to watch, but

[1:51:06] God. Bless their hands for work, Lord.

[1:51:09] may they do it with a fervent spirit. I
[1:51:11] pray. I pray you'd bless our elders,
[1:51:13] Lord. Those who really, Lord, may it's
[1:51:16] hard for them sometimes even to come to
[1:51:17] the house of God. I pray you'd
[1:51:20] strengthen the feeble knees, Lord. Lift
[1:51:21] up the hands that hang down, oh God. May
[1:51:24] there be a shout of God in the camp

[1:51:41] hold of them. Uh, and anxiety, Lord, I
[1:51:43] pray, God, that you'd come down and heal
[1:51:45] them right now, Lord. I pray you'd you'd

[1:51:53] body, heal them tonight, Lord. These
[1:51:55] special requests that were made tonight,
[1:51:56] I pray you'd heal them and meet these
[1:51:58] needs. Oh God, send a revival among us,
[1:52:00] oh God. Strengthen us, oh Lord, for the
[1:52:03] work that we have to do. May we may we
[1:52:05] may be small in number, Lord, but we're
[1:52:07] mighty in spirit, oh God. May we
[1:52:09] continue to do what you've called us to
[1:52:11] do and not be afraid of anything, of any
[1:52:13] obstacle the devil would bring. I pray
[1:52:15] you grant it, Lord. Oh, we thank you
[1:52:17] tonight. We love you and we thank you.
[1:52:19] We worship you with all of our hearts in
[1:52:21] Jesus name. We believe you heard our

[1:52:37] welcome to just worship him for a
[1:52:38] minute. And we believe that he has met
[1:52:41] our desire, our request. Just worship
