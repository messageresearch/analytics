Fay with us amen give him a big hand I enjoyed that song enjoyed it and I always love to hear her sing thing it's like Vestal come back to life again and uh sure good to see you all again and I was hoping they had brother Wayne cranked up there a little bit I was wanting to hear a little bit more of that guitar but maybe we get maybe we'll get to hear a little bit more later if you have your Bibles with us let's go to uh Genesis chapter 2 and verse 21 Genesis 2 and verse 21 are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen amen it's always a good time to come together and Genesis chapter 2 also brother Josh Kathy that's with us here from Tucson Arizona uh he'll be speaking for us in the evening service at 3:00 so if you can uh stick around and I'm sure you'll be blessed by brother Josh he's always a blessing to us here and I believe sister Paula Kathy that's his mom's with us this morning from Dyersburg your dad God bless you good to see you all this morning Genesis 2:21 I'm going to get right to it now I'm going to quit talking and try to get right on into this Genesis 221 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought forth and brought her unto the brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and let's go over to Joel chapter 2 and verse 28 Joel 2:28 very familiar to most of us here Joel 2 and verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon thy servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and just one more before you're seated 2 Corinthians chapter 3 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse two 2 Corinthians 3 and 2 ye are our epistle written on our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such as and such Trust we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything is of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God can you say Amen to that who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life and you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word this morning and if we could just title this this morning i' would like to take what we spoke on two weeks ago on the Awakening of the Bride i' like to take a part two a living body and I believe that's what we have here on the Earth today a living body of Christ and if you'll actually go back there to where God would take Eve he would actually start off in the Garden of Eden and he would he would make he would make a man and then he would make a he would make all he made all the animals and he made a he would take a I think brother Wendell mentioned this he would take a giraffe out of the out of the dirt a male giraffe out of the dirt and then he' take a female giraffe out of the dirt and he would take a a male monkey out of the dirt and a female monkey out of the dirt but when he made woman when he made the bride to his first Adam he took her directly out of the side of Adam himself and that's because she would be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she would be part of him and so just to lay a background this morning I would say uh just what brother Brandon would say here in the in the rising of the sun he said but now for instance what if we were going back to Tucson this afternoon not this afternoon buddy you still got to preach but if we were going back to Tucson and he talks about the big Cadillac you would have and and maybe it would be this the finest that'd be this car would be just he said you know you would have the floorboards were plush and the steering wheel was nickel plated and I've read this one before and and uh I always thought this was a pretty cool car that brother brandham describes and uh but he actually talks about this car and how great it would be but he said if there's he said he said you could have everything in it he said that's running running the power of the gasoline it's the octane he said now when you're going to start them you can have two of these identical cars they could look the same they could be built the same the same manufacturer and maybe they would just be some of the finest automobiles on the road Road and you put them right there side by side but if one of them has got gas in it it'll start up and go down the road but the other one without the gasoline in it won't move why because it's not the it's not the mechanics of the car it's actually something to make the car go down the road it's something to make the car move can you say Amen so it's not good enough just to be a Christian and sit in church and say well I I've got all I need just go here I hear the message of the hour that's wonderful but really what we need is the spirit of God in us to make the word live in us again can you say Amen and so we go on down here brother Brandon would say he said one of them don't have any spark any firing power well you say the power is in the gasoline he said I don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power unless there's power there to confirm that that's the gasoline it's just might as well be water so you could you could have everything you could have everything right you could dress right look right act right go to church three times a week everything you want to do could be just perfect and I believe in all these things but none of that is going to move you towards a rapture none of that is going to raise you up in the time of rapture but the word being made manifest in you and living through you as a living word that that makes a living body can you say amen and so brother Brandon would go on he said no matter how much theologians claim how well you've got your church set how much education you've got how much like the Bible until the wave sheath until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to Quicken that word the gasoline represents the word he said it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move can you say amen he said we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics now I would like to just go ahead and tell you a prophet didn't say there was nothing to the mechanics but he said you've emphasized the mechanics and you've completely left off the Dynamics that would make the word live so it's not good enough to go over here and just be a good fundamental Christian but you've got to have something on the inside of you that will make you move from the dead condition that you're in and actually raise you up into Heavenly things can you say Amen we're not just here to be another church we're not just here to be another bride he said there be brides and brides and churches and church but there'll come one bride and there'll be one church that's going to go in a Rapture can you say Amen so it's not just another church it's not just another bride it's not just another set of rules for our church but it's something that has come on the inside of us that is going to raise us up in the time of rapture can you say amen and so brother Brandon would say here he said it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline and when you try to put the holy spirit in a denomination you can get a Putter and you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but oh I'm so glad that there's a 10,000 octane power the word of God and a holy ghost to light it up well can you sayen it's not just the spirit but it's not just the word you've got to have the word and the spirit to make this thing move on down the road you can't stay in your condition and go in a Rapture but you've got to have something move you from your condition it's got to be an Awakening of the Bride in this time it's got to be something to raise us up from our from our from our worldly mentality and the way we are and the way we Act and the way we do our everyday lives will actually bog us down to such a place where you can't move but when the Holy Ghost comes on the inside it actually ignites the word that you've heard and it makes a living Epistle of you can you say Amen brother Brandon would say excuse me the Bible says in 1 th 1 Thessalonians 1 and 5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake see it's not in word only it's not hearing the word that saves you but it's the word becoming alive in you that saves you so you can sit and hear this message every service and you can sit and listen to this message every day in your home you could read that Bible until you've read every every chapter every verse of it and those are good things but that will not do anything unless the Holy Ghost comes on the inside of you and makes the word live what you've read and makes it makes the word on the inside of you live out and be an epistle can you say Amen so we're not just here to play church and you we're not here just to have a good time or a good social Gathering we're not just here to say well we've learned a little bit today or the instructions were good and we learned how to dress we learned how to act no did it actually come on the inside of you and was it quickened by the Holy Ghost and if it was not quickened by the Holy Ghost then it's just a dead letter and when you walk out of here and you go to work on Monday morning you'll forget what was said and you'll forget how you're supposed to act as a Christian you for you'll forget how you're supposed to talk as a Christian but what you'll do if you really come in contact with the Holy Ghost me in this message and you see who you are and you see the message that has brought you out then you'll know that I'm a living body and I do not have to bow down to the man of this world I do not have to bow down to the Creeds of denominations but I've actually am walking in the fullness and the manifestation of the message of the hour I'm no longer just looking for a bride I am the bride can you say Amen I'm no longer looking for somebody to raise up and live the message I'm going to live this message I'm not looking for for somebody just to come in the power but I am going to come in the power of this message I'm not looking for somebody else to do the job of being ready for a Rapture I'm going to be ready for the Rapture I'm not looking for somebody else to fulfill that part of the scripture I am going to fulfill that part of the scripture why because he's Raised Me Up by a Living Word with a living power and a living bride is on the earth now doing the same works that he did can you say Amen so we're not looking for somebody else to take our position my position is to be part of this bride I'm not looking for somebody else to sit where you're sitting you're sitting where God placed you this morning for a reason you're not listen God did not put you here just to make it through the tribulation but he put you here so that you can be called up higher into a Rapture can you say Amen listen I think we're too often we're thinking well we're just another church and we go through the motions like every other Church we're not just another church we believe that God has restored a message in our day we believe that God has called us for a higher calling we believe that God has called us from a dead condition of a denominational system into the newness of life into the gospel message of the hour can you say amen God has not put us here just to be another Christian but he's put us here to live out the word of God can you say Amen so I'll get on down here just a little bit and brother B said the word of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up he said and resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church he said that's what shoved that Cadillac down the road Yonder under the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved over the people at the day of Pentecost making him the same yesterday today and for ever so if the Holy Ghost comes in this church it'll be just like an Acts 2 Church well can you say Amen if the Holy Ghost comes on you you'll act just like they did if you if the Holy Ghost comes into you you'll believe the word that they believe if the Holy Ghost comes on this church you will do the same things that they did why because God has never changed his program he's never changed his way of doing things but he's always done the same thing he is still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever can you say Amen so when you look at that and you see that it takes the power to make this word live listen I believe that the word lives I believe that the word we are serving is a Living Word but to live through you there's got to be something on the inside of you to make the word live I don't believe that the message we're serving is a dead message I don't believe that for a minute but if you don't have something on the inside of you that will really believe that message then it's just dead to you it's not dead the word itself is not dead but somebody has got to make this message live through them can you say amen amen and so the the message is not dead the word is not dead this Bible the words in this Bible are not dead words can you say Amen so how is it dead if it's just in the letter if you read it without the holy ghost in your life it's just a dead letter to you if you're listening to tape service after service and there's been no quickening power on the inside of you it's just dead letters to you but if you've got the Holy Ghost on the inside of you then it will actually resurrect you by the things that you hear it will resurrect you by the things that you read when you read that there will be a Rapture of the church you believe there's going to be a Rapture of the church when you read that there's a holy ghost coming just like the book of Acts you participate in that why it's the bride's Revival that is Awakening the bride today and you are coming into full manifestation as Sons and Daughters of God today oh I wish somebody'd preach with me here this morning you don't have to worry about who you are you are the bride you don't have to worry about what why was that service not more emotional don't worry about how emotional the service was is there something on the inside of you that made the word live on Monday morning is there something on the inside of our young people that makes them act different dress different is it something that makes you have a difference from the world you will not act like the world you won't be partakers of the things of this world why because God is moving through you God is living through you you can't look any different than what the inside of you looks like oh sure you might be able to go for a while and say well I'm just I'm just struggling along here I'm trying to look like a Christian I'm trying to wear the long dresses and the have the long hair listen it won't do you no good to try until you get something on the inside that actually makes you want to line up with the word of God it's not about putting on something on the outside it's something on the inside that shows on the outside can you say Amen listen the church it's not a it's not a list of rules you can come sitting this church with pants on you can come sitting this church in here a woman can sit here and not line up to this message at all and it wouldn't do her any good to try to blend in why because just blend it in ain't going to make it a Rapture but if you'll actually get something on the inside of you sister Stephanie when you came back to the Lord and you came down with a broken and a contrite heart there was something on the inside of you that made you let your hair grow out there was something on the inside of you that made you act like a Christian and start going to church again listen we're not here just for rules we're not here just for a show but we're here for the Holy Ghost to have way in our lives can you say Amen this is not just another church it's not just another time of of Revival but this is the final Revival this is the final people in a final in the final age can you say Amen listen you can say you can say where you getting all this brother Joel well the scriptures are very plain the the scriptures are very plain that there will be a coming of Christ and there will be there will be dead that have already went into the ground and they will come up with him can you say amen and if we are a part of this group whether we go by way of the Grave or whether we go in a Rapture listen either way we're going to be in a Rapture together caught up together to meet our Lord but you've got to have the quickening power on the inside of you or you'll never be raised again can you say Amen so it's not just another quickening it's not just another Power it's not just another Pentecostal power I say praise God for the Pentecostal power praise God for the gifts of the Spirit praise God for all these things but there's got to be something on the inside of the Bride that actually ignites you by the word and the message of your age it's not just another messenger it's not just another message but it is God himself coming into the believer and living out through you can you say Amen God's not looking for just another form and not just another form of a body of Christ but he's looking for the body of Christ who can live today he's looking for a living body who will be doing the same thing not by emotion but by the word and if the word is there and the spirit ignites the word you are an invincible Army can you say Amen you are unstoppable well somebody ought to say praise the Lord I am Invincible here this morning not this flesh is Invincible but the body word of God that is in you is Invincible nothing can shut you up nothing can stop you can you say Amen am GL so if the bride has a voice and we know she does then she's got to be feeding on something so that she can speak what she's heard can you say Amen so the bride in the first in the first in the Garden of Eden the first bride you'll see that she would fall by disbelieving one word can you say amen and now that wasn't that wasn't something that there was never a promise that she wouldn't fall but God put him on free moral agency and said you've got this entire Garden you've got everything here and I told you about this a couple weeks ago you've got everything everything is yours but you can't can't touch the one tree you can't do this one thing and she couldn't keep that part of the word why I would like to say it like this this is before you could be redeemed this is before a fall and in order to be redeemed you've had to fallen and be brought back can you say amen and so in this age you are actually more powerful than the first Eve was she could fall to The Cutting devis fables of Satan but you cannot fall because of something on the inside of you that is actually already overcome the devil well can you say Amen this is not something you can fall the devil cannot steal your joy the devil cannot take your health the devil cannot take you out why because he has no power over you because you are not your own but you are a part of him can you say Amen you're not just another church and that's why I say that so often you're not just another church member but you're part of a living body and you have power can you say Amen well how we get there brother Joel you're born into it you're born into this body by one Spirit we're born into this body not by somebody walking in the back door and saying do you understand the Seven Seals do you understand the Thunders do you understand all these things do you understand exactly how uh everything every un unveiled mystery do you do you understand all these things no maybe you don't understand them just yet but if there's something on the inside of you a seat of God and then the word is preached if the word falls on good seed then it will produce Life in The Believer can you say Amen so it doesn't take a work up or emotion you may sit there for years on that Pew and you may never make a move but when the spirit and the seed that life come together something will start to grow in your life something will start to manifest in your life there will be something more than just another Sunday morning service but there'll be something raised up in the person that says I believe every word of that message that's been preached I believe everything that a prophet said I may not look like it yet but I'm striving to line up with the word of God in this day that's a bride that's Rising that's a bride that's in full power that's a bride that has full strength not one that may look good but one that the word has had an effect on can you say Amen so when the word has an effect it's not just something that we make ourselves do Brother David this is election this is predestination you say well that's a dirty word it's a new testament word predestination maybe maybe foreign to denominational churches but it's a Bible word it's exactly what Paul taught and it's what our messenger came and taught us everything Paul taught he taught us and he actually took us back listen how do we know we're following a word Prophet because the word Prophet took us right back to the scriptures he didn't cut out one scripture to fit his idea he didn't cut out one scripture to fit just an agenda he didn't cut out one scripture to try to show who he was but he proved by the scripture that there was a word coming and a bride coming there was a word appearing and a bride coming of Christ and you are on the Earth today can you say Amen you say well where's the body of Jesus Christ well you are the body of Jesus Christ there there is a literal body Believers believe that there's a literal body coming back but this is this is the body for today brother BR said you are the very body you have the hands of Jesus you have you are the feet of Jesus you are the voice of Jesus can you say Amen so if the voice of the Resurrection was in the first body the voice of the Resurrection is in this body we don't have to wait for a prophet to come back and reveal the voice of the Resurrection to us but the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride can you say Amen why would we look for something else to come when the very body of Jesus Christ is sitting right here among us today well can you say Amen you say brother Joel where do you get Authority for that I'm going to tell you he said no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a Dynamics to make it work that's what he proved he said that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away that stone I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it and what did he leave you he left you that same spirit and if that spirit that was in Jesus will come in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies to the word can you say Amen he's alive again he was not only the mechanics he was the Dynamics to prove it can you say amen and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him well can you say Amen now we're going to get down to the sermon part this morning if we are the second Eve we have got to come forth from the side of Adam himself if the first Eve had to come from the literal body of Adam then the second Eve has got to come by the same way we've got to come from the very life that was in Christ has got to dwell in The Believer can you say Amen so we're not here listen we're not just a a a pretend body we're not just here to say well God has raised us up just to kind of uh fill his place but no we understand there's an absence of the physical body of Jesus Christ on the Earth but in his absence you are his body and his voice that's a direct quote you are his body and his voice and so it would just say it like this if you are his body and if you are his voice and I believe you are this morning if you are you will do what he said you will say what he said and I believe that God's Prophet would come in this day and he would actually turn your hearts back not just back to Pentecost but all the way back to you could recognize the very Life of Christ that would come on the Believers at the day of Pentecost would actually start to dwell again in human beings on the earth can you say Amen so it's not just another it's not just another church that would come through another age and you would start a Revival and the Revival would die Brother David but when the Revival fire started in this church it was the Life of Christ itself stealth and this bride Revival can't die no more than he can die and if his spirit is here then you are living until the time of rapture can you say amen and then the very spirit that makes you live now will just pick up another body and go live in it well come on somebody you ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth this morning you can't even face death because as a Christian there's a body already waiting for you how many believes you've got a theophany then don't worry about dying on this side because you're going to step into a theophany body don't worry about what the what the world would call death because when God looks at a Christian he realizes there is Is No Death for you but you have already been caught out from the things called out from the things of deadness and and and you've been called to the newness of Life why because in you is the potentials of a Rapture in you is the potentials of a resurrection in you is the potentials of a full restoration back to just like it was in the Garden of Eden where all things are perfect before the fall when there was no death there was nothing to ever stop the cycle of Revival but I say today we're looking for the same thing to happen but I believe the potential are already in you that's why I said a couple weeks ago standing here you are the bride's Revival you are the final voice you are the living body of Jesus Christ why because everything that you have need of for a Rapture is already on the inside of you everything you have need of to make it out of this tribulation everything you need of to go on this Rapture listen you don't have to have a Prophet come and tell you about it again you've already heard the voice of God for your age the voice of God is now living in you and the voice is in the Bride Can you say amen amen so don't look for something else to come this message is everything you have need of this message is not something different than the Bible but it is the opening of the Bible to you it is the very opening of the word of God to you can you say Amen am and brother B go on like this and he said he said as a man and woman are one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side and made both mechanics and Dynamics can you say amen amen the wife and he said the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics I would like to just present it like this when he made Adam he was nothing until the breath come in his body can you say amen he could make a human being and he could be laying there but he was nothing until the breath would come into his body and make him a living Soul so the very Breath of God had to breathe into Adam in order to make him alive well I hope you're hearing me here this morning and the Very Breath of God himself has got to come into the believer well can you say Amen or else you're just a dead Christian well can you say amen I believe that the body may be there but until you recognize something and you hear the voice of God for your day and you say well now something has woke me up something has raised me from just a body to a living body can you say Amen something has made me more than just a than more than just an denominational Christian but it has made me a Living member of this body that is on the earth now can you say Amen so we see that this is not just a a fairy tale but we'll see that through scripture this has always been God's program can you say Amen his first Adam he made the body and then he had to breathe life into the body can you say amen and then from that Adam he had to take a wife and he would call her Eve and and and we find out that she had to not come from the dust just like other other people would come or other other other animal life would come from but she would actually come from the very life that was in Adam and so it would just be a type for later on in life God see what what we miss about this whole thing is God put them on free moral agency because God knew there'd be a fall and God wanted them to be able to choose for themselves and yet she would choose to fall and then there had to be a Redemption to come back and the blood would have to cover these people there would have to be a son that would come and die not just another lamb that would come and die not just another goat that would come and die but there had to be an actual Son of God who was actually the life of God the flesh of God had to come and actually die himself be put to sleep for a while well can you say Amen had to be put to sleep so the bride could come forth under the same power and then he would raise us up with him oh can you say man I wish somebody hear me this morning if you'll ever look back to that first story it may look just like a story to you but if you ever see how God was showing his future events right there in the Garden of Eden then you can see that there may be an absence of the body of Christ today but in his absence while he was asleep while he wasn't there there was a living body and that living body would actually be the body and the voice of him and so then if you'll see when we're resurrected we're meet we were caught up together to meet him in the air we are joined together again with the groom can you say amen and so we believe there's a literal body we don't deny the literal body of Jesus Christ but we believe that where he is we're going to be someday where he is now that's where I'm going where he is that's where the bride longs to be at there's something on the inside of the Bride that doesn't want to stay here this is an Earthbound condition that we're in I don't care if the politics are better or worse than they were two weeks ago I'm going to tell you right now the Rapture is upon the bride the Rapture is still here the government's still as corrupt As It Ever Was well can you say man America has still turned down God there's nothing better except maybe your pocketbook I pray it is I know my needs to be but there's nothing better about this world than it was two weeks ago but I want to tell you what's different we're two weeks closer to a Rapture than we were two weeks ago and I would say even more so now look up for your Redemption draweth nigh look up because we're not just going to be solved here we're not going to be settled down here and we're not going to be happy with World politics we're not going to be happy with the way this condition is going listen you can walk out here on the streets and sin still abounds on the streets of America sin still abounds on the streets of this world there's still all kinds of indecency and things on the worldly streets but what is it there's a bride that is called out and looks different and is not looking to the world but is looking at a future home that has already been prepared for you can you say Amen so brother Brandon would say it like this he said until the church or the people all these Easter bunnies and ceremonies and big churches and finer will fail and pass away until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics the spirit of God that moved him to the things things he did If he if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride can you say amen for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also can you say Amen so listen we're not outside the Bible here this morning we're here to do the Greater [Music] Works we're here to do more of what he did why because we are his body it's not brother Joel PR that can lay hands on you and cast Devils out but the spirit of Christ if it's in me according to the word I can lay hands on the sick and the Devils have to go brother Stuart can stand up here and pray for the sick it's not brother steuart standing here praying for the sick but it's Christ in him obeying the word that he's heard and is laying hands on the sick and you shall recover there's no reason to come to the altar if you don't believe that when you walk away I don't care what the preacher said when he prayed what you need to do is say I'm going there as my as the commission of Jesus Christ he's going to lay his hands on me and I'm going to walk away walk away healed I'm going to be delivered of this demon that's on me everything I have need of is going to happen why because you went in obedience to the word of God now it's your job to believe on the word it's your job to believe that the word works it's it's not good enough to say well the preacher believes it and the PE and and and brother Stuart you know and brother Josh and these brothers and brother Ben he'll stand up here and tell us the word works the word works well if you don't recognize the word working it won't do you any good but you've got to let the word work through you and it will change you from those doubts and fears of this world but it will move you on into a place where you don't have to worry anymore you don't have to think well maybe cancer is too big for God no cancer is not too big for God Cancer's never been too big for God and I don't care what your condition is I don't care if it's diabetes I don't care I don't care what your condition is maybe it's hearing loss whatever it is this morning nothing is too hard for God if he ever healed a deaf person he'll always heal a deaf person if he ever healed one from cancer he'll always heal one from cancer if he ever saved a young person he's always going to be saving a young person if he ever brought one prodigal back he's going to continue to bring prodal back why because until the very end of this world his word will still be in action can you say Amen his word doesn't stop just because because your Revival fires died out a little bit because the Revival fires are here the Revival fires are here when you don't feel the Revival fires the Revival fires are here when you don't feel good the Revival fires are here when the church is half full or or maybe when it's hardly anybody here on a Wednesday night and you look around well where's the Revival the Revival is in the believer that is sitting there on a Wednesday night the listen we don't put everybody else out of the Bride Revival they might be in it too but listen just recognize what your Revival is it just because I show up to three services a week not recently but usually and don't that don't make me a part of the bride's Revival and you out of it no it's something on the inside of you I believe in Christians going to church I believe they'll go to church I believe all those things but that's not what decides who's bride and who's not whose bride is because God has put a seed on the inside of you and you recognize your day and its message and you have been raised up from the dead condition that you're in and now you can't help but serve God why because you've not you you're not you're not your own anymore but you belong to him can you say Amen we get on down here before I run out of time y'all still okay the mechanics without the Dynamics is no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics excuse me the mechanics and the Dynamics vice versa they're neither neither way you can't have one without the other you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do you any good well can you say amen he said you're just cranking on the Pistons he said you got you got the spark of the fire there but no gasoline to fire it by it'll only work as they come together so you may sit there and you may be able to work yourself into a shout well can you say amen and I believe in shouting if I have to say this every time I stand up here I guess I will but I do believe in shouting and I do believe in dancing and I do believe in speaking in tongues what can you say man everything that was restored back to this church I'm a part of it but you can't take one and then do away with the other right so if you have the real Dynamic power of God in your life it will not go against the word mechanics so if your shout will line up with the word you're speaking in tongues will line up with the word well can you say man your dance is going to line up with the word all these things are good but they're going to line up with the word of God well can you say man it's not because listen the Corinthian Church had all that stuff and then Paul had to come and set it in order so it's not just that it's not just that you have it but it's having it together you've got to have the spirit that will keep that keep the mechanics alive but you've also got to have the mechanics to know when the when the Dynamics are just over there firing off and there's nothing to it well can you say Amen so you've got to have them together hope that's okay one will go up he said he said so one will set still he said only it'll only work as they come together so one will set still and the other one will go up that's the only thing that there is to it yet they both might look alike both claim to be churches he's talking about the bride he's talking about the one goes and one stays and and one will be left and the other will be taken he's talking about that scripture here and he says so one will sit still and the other one will go up that's the only thing there is to it and yet they both might look alike both claim to be churches both claim to be bride well can you say Amen but one has mechanics and Dynamics and it brings it to pass of what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that Octane and the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion well I would like to know how you can sit still in the house of God if you've had the mechanics and the Dynamics meet together because it will cause a combustion well can you say Amen I'm I just want to stop here for a second so bad and just preach to you and I shouldn't and yall know how I feel about it you're good so when that explodes it causes the combustion I'm going to preach about it you know sometimes I look out here and you all are really good this morning morning every one of you are really wonderful y all looking at me and smiling and it's just wonderful it's nice I just want to stay here all day you know and uh and I won't but but you know I'm looking out there and I'm seeing a smiling face but sometimes and i' I've I've been the i' I've done this myself so I can preach about it sometimes you come to church and you sit there and you look you're like a mule looking at a new gate you know you're just dead as 12:00 just I mean just dead just the word couldn't move you if Jesus Christ himself walked right out and come right down there and touched you on the shoulder you I mean I'm I don't mean to be sacrilegious I'm just saying sometimes that's how bad it looks you know looks like well you just don't want to be here you know but listen the truth the truth of it is if I told you that his Spirit was literally here yes sir the actual Spirit of Christ is here and the word that he sent for the church is here if it's here then wouldn't you have the same reaction that if the L literal body himself was here the truth be told we have a lot of of people who are very similar to the people that were in Jesus's day that didn't recognize him when he came well can you say amen and so people today fail to recognize him when he comes and so I've preached on this before but I'm just going to say it again if that's okay you've got to entertain him when he's here it's not him coming to be entertained he wants to entertain you and if you are the living body then we got to act like we're alive but it's not just on the Flesh and so I want to break this down to you just a little bit your flesh may not move but something on the inside of you will so I'm not accusing somebody of sitting there quiet that's not necessarily what I'm talking about but is there something on the inside of you that has changed you from what you are this morning to what you're going to be on Monday morning well can you say Amen there's got to be something on the inside of you that actually comes alive and changes there's got to be something different can you say Amen there's got to be something that moves you not it's got to be something that moves you forward this car may not have jumped up and down it may not have you know sat there and and you know maybe maybe spun out and did donuts and stuff but what it did was it moved right on down the road and made it to its destination why because there was something on the inside of the car that would move the car so if there's something on the inside of the believer I may not see the emotion of it today I do believe there'll be something on your face that'll show you're listening but I may not see the full full effect of the word today but what I will see and what you will see as fruit inspectors of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you will see tomorrow a different person and the next day a different person and next year it'll be somebody different it won't look the same listen because something has changed you and you are different than you used to be so I'm not saying everybody's going to change overnight I'm not saying everybody's not going to fall down but I love how brother Josh benett said it you you can fall down but you cannot fall away you can fall down and make mistakes but you cannot fall away if you were ordained to be in this body you always were and you always will be nothing can take you out of this body nothing can change you why because you are nothing can change you for the worst but the only change you're going to make is better every day every day can you say Amen am we'll get on down here and see if we can finish before the lunch Burns Paul said the gospel came to us not in word only but brother brandom doesn't play on words he said through the spark also to make it move there you are it came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the True Believer to eternal life The Same Spirit now Romans 811 if the Same Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he said there you are if the bridegroom Spirit dwells in the bride what can you say Amen if the bridegroom Spirit dwells in you you are the bride and that actually makes the bride do what what what what Jesus himself did listen and so I believe the bride will have both the mechanics and the Dynamics do you believe it when the Believers gathered in the upper room all in one Accord and they believe the message brother R said but they were cowards they had the mechanics to go up up there but they were all sitting back in there saying oh I'm afraid of them I'm afraid to go out with all them great big Bishops and things out there oh I'm afraid them priest and things the kids at school's going to laugh at me the church down the street will laugh at me I don't really care who laughs at me because I'm not trying to match them Lord knows I'm not trying to match them I want to match what he wants for me well can you say amen God doesn't want me just to be another denominational Church listen there are good people in the denominational churches I'm not putting them out but we are not called to be a denominational Church we're called to be the pride of Jesus Christ can you say amen he said so I'm not he said oh I'm they were cowards they were afraid of the priests and things I'm afraid to make that claim I'm afraid to say I I believe on him oh I just can't do it see but all of a sudden the Dynamics come well can you say amen and what did it do it not only filled their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics their bodies were quickened they were no more cowards I want you to know they were still in their physical bodies on Earth but there was some kind of a spirit that came in them they were not scared SC of what the other churches thought of them no more they weren't scared if somebody called them a Holy Roller or a Pentecostal listen we're not scared of what the Baptists or the methodists call you what I'm here to tell you this morning that you are not just the denomination but you are called and chosen I say wake up Sleeping Giant wipe the sleep from your eyes it's your time to raise up as the army of [Music] God you don't have to stay down there anymore it's like Samson sitting there with his eyes put out Samson may have stood there with no no power no more and he had no eyes in his head anymore but listen there came to him a thought just a thought that once more he could have this revival fire again and it came stronger than it ever had before maybe you've been falling down and you've Fallen you've fallen down and can't seem to get up from this message anymore and you seem like you just can't believe it like you used to and there's no spark like there used to be but let me go ahead and tell you just put your hands up on the pillars and say once more Lord restore unto me the joy of your of thy salvation restore unto me the power to defeat the enemy of this day wake up sleep and GI it's your time can you say Amen we're not cowards because we've met the spirit of God we don't have to be worried about the way we dress or act because we've got the spirit of God in us well can you say amen God wants us to not be cowards but he wants us to be soldiers in the army of God he wants you to be bold he wants you to be courageous with this message he doesn't want you to be afraid of the message of Malachi 4 but stand up and declare that this is the restoration message and it is changing Hearts back again can you say Amen their bodies were K were quickened no more cowards they went right on out in the face of the people you men of Judea and you that dwell in Jerusalem before the Dynamics come they were just mechanics see you men that dwell in Jerusalem let this be known unto you and hearken un my words these are not drunk as you suppose I'm one of them this is that I'll show you what it is it's the scripture this is that what can you say amen he said and I've always said if this ain't that let me keep this till that comes and he said no this is it well can you say Amen we're not looking for that to come but we know that what we've got this is that that was spoken of by the Prophet this is that that was spoken of and prophesied for our day well come on church do you realize you're living out prophecy you're living out the revelation of the Mysteries contained in the book you are living out and you are written Epistles read of all men the open book has produced a bride that can see that the mechanics and the Dynamics are both here and they are going to do the Greater Works now come on somebody you know that you're she you know you're the bride now we time to rise up and act like it don't act like we're put down and defeated you can't be defeated oh you might lose your job and you might even fall apart in a marriage but God he's not going to leave you here he's going to take you to a place that's already been prepared for you it is a city that has been dwelt in by the lamb and he's the light of the world and you are going to go there and you're going to S with him listen the wedding has already taken in place you've already been married to the groom it's time to rise up and recognize your status the bride and the groom have come together and you now have the mechanics and the Dynamics can you say Amen right so it's not something we're looking for can you say Amen brother brandom said that was spoken by the prophet Joel and it'll come to pass in the last days sayith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh see the Dynamics come into the mechanics so they were there waiting under the mechanics and the Dynamics came and filled the house where they were sitting well can you say amen and so they were no longer just sitting waiting but now they were up and doing they were up acting like drunk men and if it had that effect on them couldn't it have that same effect on us and I'd say that'd be just fine wouldn't you it wouldn't hurt nobody's feelings in here if we started acting like drunk men at 3:00 in the afternoon we might we might totally miss your service buddy 3:00 we'll be walking around drunk as skunks and on new wine Hallelujah well I'd be okay with a good old Revival again wouldn't you I'd be just fine if the if the church started acting just like they did on Acts 2 when they started acting like drunk well come on somebody I know that a I know that ain't the sign that God's with you because we've got a promise that God's with you but it's okay once in a while to bask in the presence of God and let the Holy Spirit run over on the outside and let the whole world know I'm one of them Holy Rollers I'm one of them that is over this world I am the Bride of Jesus Christ can you say amen amen they wasn't afraid no more some of you people that are afraid that some woman will laugh at you for having long hair or quit wearing makeup some of you men that's afraid your organization will throw you out when you baptize your congregation in the scriptural baptism you need to close yourself in the upper room till the Dynamics come in well can you say amen he said that's right it changed them it quickened them it made them different they were a changed people from then on it quickened them from an old life of being a coward to like the the lion of the tribe of Judah they were bold as a lion when the Holy Ghost came on them why you can't talk me out of this message you can't make me go back to the denominations again you can't stop this bride from moving on in the full power you have the full strength as the bride can you say Amen they absolutely faced martyrdom and nailed across as crucified upside down they were burnt they throw lions in they were no more cowards about them death had no victory over them well can you say amen he said the Dynamics was in the mechanics yes sir it quickened mortal bodies he said now listen here's another thing for proof it so quickened them in such a way till they was lifted up in Heavenly places and their mortal bodies was so Quicken till their language changed well can you say man it actually changed the very language they couldn't even talk to each other in English no more I know that wasn't their language miss me with it I'm just saying but they couldn't even talk to each other they couldn't even speak right why because they were under an in an influence From Another World they were under the influence of God himself it wasn't the world they were taught up to speak a certain language and now they totally forgot everything they knew why because the spirit of God was living through them well can you say Amen thank I'd say it's okay if if the spirit of the Lord comes and does the same thing here this morning can you say Amen it's all right listen I I I know that the gifts have been put in order and I believe that but but I I'm okay that I do believe the gifts still exist I do believe that the word did not do away with anything why because it's a restoration of all things it's a restoration of the fullness of the word and I told you a couple weeks ago and I went that direction in this sermon here but I I know I went the direction of the the importance is on the word and it is but don't go over here and say well the word's good the word's great I'm listening to it I'm here listen you can be a hearer only but not a doer also the Book of James tells you that that there's hearers only but not doers also if you've heard the word the word has got to have an action behind it can you say Amen matter of fact brother Brandon would go on to say your faith has got to have an action behind it your faith if you just say I got faith it won't do you no good until you put that faith in action where can you say amen I have faith to believe that God Saves and God restores and live like the devil no if you have faith in it then God is going to come in there and he's going to anoint that faith and you can't stay in the condition that you were in can you say amen I want to just say this and I know a lot of times I've dealt with family being out there I've got a lot of family out in the world I've got lots of family in the world and I do believe that the mechanics have been sewed into their lives but I do believe at one point in their life some point in their life God's going to go meet them with the Dynamics and actually wake them up and see who they are thank you Lord I I may not even live to see it but I know God's going to do it if you've got family out there that you're worried about I say quit worrying about him take the limits off of God well can you say man he is not limited in his power he is not limited in his resources don't limit him with your faith in him because he has no limit can you say Amen there's there's no limit to his grace there's no limit to his Mercy there's no limit to the backsliders he can bring back there's no limit to God take the limits off and let God work can you say Amen there's no more there's no more cowards there's no more limits when you've actually come into contact with the word of God and he said here's another thing for proof it's so quickened them they were caught up in and changed their language he said it quickened their language that's what the Bible said and their mortal bodies being quickened their language was quickened their thoughts were quickened their Spirits were quickened I say we need a quickening in our Spirits this morning can you say ameny listen church I know some people call it fanaticism but I I think sometimes we need to have a little fanaticism just to get back in the house of God and enjoy church again we we don't need to make this a miserable place to come we need to let this place be filled with the power of God and and and the joy of God flowing over listen don't don't make Church miserable you make it that way when you're not expecting something in the house of God well come on somebody you you you make it Miss well it's so hard to go to church it's only hard if you're not expecting something great they had a fight here a few days ago and there was them two fighters I forget their names but uh one of them was Mike Tyson I don't know the other one but they were fighting I know the loser okay but they were fighting and that that AT&T Stadium in Dallas was just full of people why they were expecting something their their expectations were just through the roof you could say their expectations were Skyhigh they were expecting something awesome something Dynamic something powerful and yet maybe there would be something something would leave disappointed but really the ones that went there for the right thing just to just to see a good fight maybe the maybe the what was his name Jake Paul is that him somebody you can admit it I'm not going to kick you out for it just so you know the fighters names I knew the other one okay Jake Paul I'm sure all his fans were excited and I'll bet they didn't act normal even that Stadium right I'll bet you they were so excited he's he's the greatest of all time some nonsense like that everybody knows that's wrong but you know that's right but you know what I'm saying if you really came to church and you knew who was going to win every service well can you say amen he can't even lose and you come expecting him to win and he does how do you walk away defeated how do you walk away my guy lost he ain't never lost a service he ain't never lost a person he ain't never lost a victory he ain't never lost well come on somebody he has never lost a war and he's not going to start now so when you come to the house of God come believeing that everything that I brought to the altar today I know that God is able to whoop every one of them Devils God is more than able to take me out of this condition God has raised me up for a time as this I'm going to take my sword I'm going to take my shield and I'm going to go to the house of God and I'm going to fight every devil that comes after me I'm going to fight every evil spirit that tries to come in my mind I'm going to try to come every every evil spirit that would try to keep me from my praise every spirit that would try to hold me back from a blessing in the well come on somebody every spirit is defeated under this great man called Jesus well can you say Amen he's never lost can you say amen he never will if sickness is in your body this morning he's never lost when he's come into a healing service can you say Amen he's never lost when there's been somebody come to the Altar and fully surrender to the power of God he has never lost can you say Amen so when you walk out of this church you can say I took my needs to The Altar and guess what he won guess what I'm the winner because he already won he took every disease he took every thought he took every battle in the mind and he overcame for me this morning it wasn't your body that overcame but it was God who was rich in Mercy has saw fit to bring you to the house of God this morning and said you are she you're more than you're more than going to make it well can you say Amen you're more than conquerors you are the body that is living out the very Revelation and the healing power of God can you say Amen well I say somebody ought to just go ahead and let the Lord have Praise In The House of God this morning God is Not defeated my God cannot lose my God has never lost listen if there's a sickness in your body there's a Living Word here to come in that body and make the body come under subjection to the word of God if there's a if there's a if there's a cancer in the building if there's somebody in here with lung trouble if there well come on I'm not over here trying to discern you I'm telling you that if it's there the word has already earn and says you are healed can you say amen God is not looking for a people God is not looking for a people that are cowards but he wants somebody to stand on his word don't just look at the word don't just hear the word but listen and act on the word can you say Amen well we okay so far God has done a great work in my life and I'm not going to let nobody tell me that he has it I'm not going to let nobody tell me that I have not overcome this world I may fight every day but the flesh May fight every day but something on the inside of me was ordained to make it all the way down to the end well can you say amen God is not going to leave me here to be burnt up with the fire and the destruction but before one drop could fall the bride has got to go home what can you say Amen when you give the car some gasoline and it meets with a spark it'll move right if it sits still then you may need to take that car to a mechanic we got Dr Jesus in the house this morning listen we're not Earthbound anymore I I've probably said it before I say a lot of things that I've said before but you know when the eagle was in the chicken pin he was always an eagle he was born an eagle he had he looked like an eagle he didn't even look like he was in the right place he was actually born to be a part of a Heavenly Body but he was in a denominational system and they were clucking around and they were trying to tell him well you can't fly over that fence because you're a chicken well they could tell him he was a chicken but he wasn't a chicken Brother David they could tell him he was he had no he had no power but inside of this Eagle there was power all the time well can you say Amen inside of this Eagle there was power in those wings that would raise him up out of a denominational system inside of this Eagle he could look over there and see them hens of scratching and he tried to do what they did and he just couldn't fit in but then one day he heard an eagle scream what can you say man he heard a prophet of Malachi 4 fly over and say come out of her my people get away from those denominational walls you're not a chicken and the little Eagle had heard other voices all its life but it heard this voice and recognized the voice and became a living Eagle that day it may have been down there and couldn't fly but he actually found the power to fly out of that chicken coop why just by hearing the word of God and the power that woke up inside of him raised him out of the situation he was in out of the bondage that he was in I say you're free this morning little bride you're more than able to take the land you've already possess the promises but don't let the Giants scare you don't let the Devils tell you that there's nothing for you everything in this message is yours can you say Amen everything is yours all of it the power the overcoming your children everything is yours everywhere the the your foot would step is yours every possession you you just go ahead and claim every one of them children this morning come on somebody claim those brothers and those sisters and everybody else go ahead and claim them this morning why because there's no reason to be beat down by a devil that said I've got your kids no that devil ain't got nobody he's just a scarecrow that's right but what he's doing is he's scaring you because he's the voice you're feeding we'll stay away from that one but he's the voice you're feeding so so you just can't you can't feed that one anymore and so you move right on and then you've got to you've got to you've got to feed on the word of God can you say Amen you've got to you've got to you got to have an appetite for Spiritual things well can you say Amen actually if you don't have an appetite for coming to the church and what you'll find out is eventually you'll you'll quit coming at all right and if you have no appetite for the word of God there's no reason to go to church because that's what takes up most of the time and and if there's and if there's no appetite for words you'll find that the the tapes you used to listen to are just Dusty and or or or the thumb drive or whatever the phone you'll find that that's the least used app why because you don't listen anymore because your appetite has been filled you've been filled up with things of the world and you've been given in to the world and say well well I I'm full I I don't need I have need of nothing listen that's a leot ofan mentality that's a leot ofan spirit but we are not here for the leot ofan church we're not here to be called leot of sins but you're here to be called prde can you say Amen you're here to be called out of the Le to sin Church you're not going to be led to sleep by the lay of sins but you have been called to be an overcomer you are just like sson standing there that day you're more than able to kill every demon that has oppressed you can you say Amen so wake up sleeping Giants I say wake up you're a living body today you're you you're still alive the power is still there you can reach around there brother Ram said he can reach around there and still feel he could feel those locks beginning to grow he could actually feel the the faith coming back on him why he started looking for that Faith again where's where's that faith that I once had the faith is there if you'll just use it can you say Amen the faith was there and no doubt Samson had grown that hair a little bit longer than he thought he did and he was standing there and he was in a defeated State suffering and they were laughing at him and mocking him well come on somebody and the whole time he was God's man for the hour but he had given himself over to a worldly system and was deceived by it for a time but you won't be deceived for long you may be led astray you may be led astray but you're going to come back well can you say man you may be led out to the world for a season but you are going to come back why because there's some Philistines to destroy there's some demons to fight and God needs his army all together God wants you to be in the in the saddle this morning God want you to be in battle armor this morning and be ready to fight the Devils that have come after you amen well can you say am man brother B said you ever see how independent that old Eagle walks he don't hop like a vulture to see every dead and all the carry on laying around on the ground no sir he walks proud Eagle says shut your mouth Buzzard says here's some good dinner over here he says not for me my desires has changed my appetite is different for man shall not live on the world alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God well can you say Amen brother Brandon would say it like this I don't have the quote in front of me but he said he said Jesus when he was tempted by the devil was he was an ex he was actually made an example for for the weakest of Christians you've heard the quote he was he was made as an example for the weakest of Christians he said it is written it is written it's not just one quote here one scripture here and one scripture here you know that's that's the problem with denominations listen it's not that I'm I'm against them but I'm against the spirit that would try to cut out this part you say well this don't matter no more this don't mind listen it it's all God's word or none of it is what can you say Amen so what we're doing today is we're not here to just feed on part of it we're not here to just feed on this and and we'll say we'll just leave this part out we don't believe in the coming of a fifth fourth Elijah in this day we don't believe in any of that listen you better believe in it or you're going to miss it you better believe in the word or you going to miss it when it comes if they didn't believe on everything that Jesus was supposed to do when he came they missed him why because he came in such a simple way but it was a scriptural way and God has come again in our day in a simple way but it is a scriptural way and he came with a voice to call out a bride and she is making herself ready to go meet the Lord in the air for the wedding supper well can you say Amen brother B said you are no longer you are no longer a scavenger you're an eagle how many Eagles we got in here this morning you can fly higher you can see farther you're you're just more than what them other buzzards and vultures are and he said he said you don't want the things of the world you're a son and daughter of God you're feasting at a fountain that the world knows nothing about you're drinking it somebody knows the world no no knows nothing about it you're eating hidden Mana can you say Amen that the world never even know nothing of for if you're an eagle you're quickened where you can get to it if you can't get to it down here you've got to get up here you've got to be quickened lifted up there so it will Quicken I believe this morning there's some Eagles sitting here who have been quickened and are now sitting together in Heavenly places what can you say man you're not sitting back there wondering is Elijah going to come we can say Elijah's here is there going to come a bride the bride's here what can you say man is there going to be a word come for this day and restore us back the restoration message is here I say wake up sleep and CH re recogniz your day and its message the power of God is here to change you back to what a Son of God should be brother B goes on down here he said the sun has got to be revealed again the bride in the last day the quickening power has got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word Of Living God no he said it quickened them to life he said it does the same thing now for us well can you say Amen what it did for Acts 2 Christians it can do this morning can you say amen I knew I'd lose you at 12:00 but I didn't know it' be that sharp on the dot I'm almost done I promise got one minute left I might be able to make it too he said the sun's got to be revealed he said the power has got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of a living God I just want to wrap this back into where I started on part one a couple weeks ago the word came and opened to us and when the word came the Thunders sounded the Thunders uttered their voices it was the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals can you say amen and brother brandom actually says that that is what would wake the bride up so what we see this morning is an Awakening of the Bride under the message of the hour but she has found that the Dynamics have have come but she also has the mechanics in this hour no other bride could be awakened like this bride no other bride could have the power of this bride no other bride could come to maturity like this bride why because this bride has had an open book what can you say Amen this bride has no seals on the Bible no more but the seals have been loosed and you are awake to every promise in the book and you can take full possession of your promises today can you say Amen as the musicians would come my time's up musicians go ahead and come I'm going find a place to stop here I just want to say this before we close if I can find find a spot to stop Ephesians 2 and if we could read this Ephesians 2 and 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins how many's ever been dead in sin before you've been dead in sin you've been backslid or you've been cold on God or you've just been a full out sinner you couldn't find your way to God but he came and quickened you can you say amen and wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but now listen but God who is rich in Mercy how can you say thank God for him being Mercy merciful to us this morning but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and he said here and I love this and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'm resting on that this morning I'm riding on that this morning the word of God has come the word has been open and the son of man has come and made you free and who the son has set free you are free indeed can you say Amen this morning I wonder if you'd stand to your feet if you have a need this morning if one of you would say well I I I just don't feel free here this morning I think somebody needs to take their Christian Liberty in the house of God and say I'm free I'm free from the chains that seem to bind me I'm free from an denominational Creed or system that says I just need to hear it no I'm a doer of this word can you say Amen I'm a doer I'm not just going to have it in word only but the spirit has come and woke this bride up can you say amen God has done something for us sir God is moving can you say amen I believe the move is on for the the bride brother brandom said that was thus sayith the Lord that was thus sayith the Lord he said the move is on for the bride he said the reason they were looking for Revival they failed to realize the Awakening of the Bride The Awakening has come the bride is here she's making herself ready can you say Amen it's the word it's the spirit coming together and moving upon us now oh can you say Amen this morning just bow your heads with me if you would for a minute if you have a need on your heart just go ahead and put your hands up to him and say I want to be quick in here this morning by that word I just want to be made alive again I just want to come back into Revival again I want the spirit of Revival on me can you say Amen just tell the Lord right where you're at say Lord revive us again put something on the inside of me that makes me want to come to the house of God put something on the inside of me that wants me to live a Christian life but something on the inside of me that wants to live out the body word of the son of man again oh if you just sit there and just tell them right where you're at I believe God can hear every prayer if you need to come to the altar the the altars open God bless you you thought I was worth saving so you came and Chang my life you thought I was worth keeping oh so you clean me up inside you thought I was to die for so you sacrifice your life so I could be free and I could be whole and I could tell everyone I know you thought I was worth saving oh yes he did so you came and changed my life you thought I was worth it oh do you believe
